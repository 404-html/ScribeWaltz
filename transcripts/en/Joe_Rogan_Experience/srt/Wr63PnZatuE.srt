We brought customers

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,140
Did it again?
Fucking idiot.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,290
I'm not a good spokesperson for weed.
I'm really not.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,540
I mean I am and I'm not at the same
time.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,760
You could use a lot of what I do against
me.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,570

Oh,

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,040
Brian Kaylin,
my friend.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,420
Good to be here.
Glad to be here.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,270
My friend who at one point in time
stopped doing standup boy.

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,160
I remember that.
The dark days,

17
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,290
the dark days of hanging out with
actors.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,960
So long time,
two years mother fuckers.

19
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,650
They got you.
Gotcha.

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,640
With other stupid silliness,
but he's in character.

21
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:13,050
Hold on it.
Got You.

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,330
You started wanting to be like them.
You wanted to be accepted.

23
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,000
You want to be cool.
I want to make believe for A.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,520
I just want to be down before we even
get started.

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,130
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're at Cobb's comedy club this

26
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,700
weekend.
It's me,

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,550
Tommy and Sam triple.
If you've never seen tom or Sam,

28
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:29,940
they're both fucking awesome dudes.
Some of the funniest guys working today.

29
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,880
And uh,
I have my cobb's comedy club Mug here.

30
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,950
My 25th anniversary.
I've never been.

31
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:39,150
If you're a San Francisco person or
anywhere in the north west of count,

32
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:39,420
what is it?

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,710
Northwest California,
whatever.

34
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,200
Northern California.
It's fucking great club.

35
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,030
It's a real,
a club where they really,

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,351
you know,
Tom,

37
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:49,320
the guy who runs it really honors the
art of standup.

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,990
He really loves it.
There's a few clubs like that,

39
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:53,810
you know,
there's Wendy in Denver and this,

40
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,470
there's a few all throughout the country
with the,

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,470
the owner,
the person who runs it really love

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,400
standup and that's one of them.
So being as corporate sort of,

43
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,450
you know,
fuck,

44
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:03,990
yeah,
that's it.

45
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,100
Well,
you know what I've got to tell you,

46
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,750
you know,
people will complain about the Improv's

47
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,430
I never see.
I think they're great.

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,120
They can clean,
they take care of everything.

49
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:13,420
It's run really well.
It's,

50
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:15,870
it's pretty cool
sweater.

51
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,310
Oh,
is that me?

52
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,230
Yeah.
Oh,

53
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,560
I thought it was on.
Um,

54
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,820
um,
yeah,

55
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,830
you know,
the thing is they guarantee you a good

56
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:24,630
show.
It's guaranteed they're going to be

57
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,620
taking care of the room.

58
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,300
They're going to be making sure there's
no hecklers.

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,490
The waitresses are all will be well
trained,

60
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:32,580
the Dj all beyond on point.
It's all the same experience.

61
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,440
It's just a little bit of different
staff,

62
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:35,910
different staff.
And you know,

63
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:39,890
in Kentucky it's like they put emphasis
on the fact that they go,

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,290
if you come here and pay a premium,
you're going to laugh your ass off for

65
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,160
two hours.
They're going to do,

66
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,070
we're going to do a good job.
They know what the fuck they're doing

67
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,180
and there's a lot of them,
you know,

68
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,370
but it's one of those good chains,
you know,

69
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,243
people go,
oh,

70
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,030
what's up mom and pop clubs does.
It is,

71
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:55,680
it really is,
is it ever put out one?

72
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,880
And even if the,
even if it does,

73
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,710
maybe those mom and pop one socked,
right?

74
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,130
Why can they compete?

75
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,731
That's the question.
Well,

76
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,340
the problem is I do hear that they do
this.

77
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,200
When they tell you you can't work the
other club.

78
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,730
Well I,
I'm a member.

79
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,880
I'm they levity represents me and I love
them.

80
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:13,260
They financed my one hour just recently.
They take some levity is the people that

81
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,580
owned.
But Robert Procurement owns a lot of

82
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,630
men.
He's a personal friend.

83
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,590
And I'm going to tell you something
right now.

84
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:19,180
I'm not saying just because I'm going to
put the podcasts.

85
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,860
That guy's a great guy,
great guy.

86
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,670
He loves comedy is very competitive.
I don't mind that.

87
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,140
I mean,
but.

88
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,420
But I think at the end of the day those
guys are there.

89
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,710
They're there.
I would have said that they,

90
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,430
they only let you do the Improv.
The fact that I have a different booking

91
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,490
agent now who's fantastic.
I'm Justin Edberg over at super

92
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,270
entertainment.

93
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,820
I get,
I get to do any club I want and he books

94
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,300
me out anywhere I want.
So if you're with them,

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,290
any pressure to not only do the uh,
you know,

96
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,630
I didn't know that I had when I was at
Gersh.

97
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,900
Gersh had some secret deal.
Sure.

98
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,590
Info.
Exactly.

99
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,100
It was really creepy because other clubs
would tell me like a few of them would

100
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,461
say,
Hey,

101
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:56,620
I've been trying to book you forever and
I could never booked you.

102
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:57,640
And I'd be like,
really?

103
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,620
You know,
I never heard any of this.

104
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,740
I never got any of the deals like
Nashville and never did Nashville when I

105
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:03,960
was with.
There was a lot of clubs,

106
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,910
but they just would ignore me because
they have a relationship.

107
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:09,340
They develop and they cherish those
relationships because they can get more

108
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,960
bang for their buck.
It's always gonna happen.

109
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,690
But what I did is that's why you
separate the powers.

110
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,990
That's why you get a booking agent who's
going to make his own money on you in

111
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,430
his own way.
Isn't it sort of.

112
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,640
There's a fucking dance man between big
business,

113
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,510
which you can't have a fucking society
like this without a big business.

114
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,960
That extends from comedy clubs until,
let me pretty much anything.

115
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:32,180
Let me give you example of why that's
good and why it's bad you you.

116
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,520
Let's take,
for example,

117
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,470
have you noticed that when you travel
the country,

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,620
there aren't a lot of restaurants that
are locally owned,

119
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:41,370
so in other you don't see a lot of mom
and pop restaurants with character.

120
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,650
Lot of times you go into a place and
you've got hooters,

121
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,940
applebee's,
applebee's,

122
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,783
no.
Why?

123
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,150
What happened?
I don't want to eat that kind of food.

124
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:50,620
Personally.
I don't really like that kind of food.

125
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,880
I'd rather have something with
character.

126
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,300
It's one of the reasons I live,
you know,

127
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,120
what I like about New York or even
Venice doubt and you're so busy humean

128
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,710
variables but,
but it.

129
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,430
But it's individual expression and you
know,

130
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:02,260
people from Venice named cook their own
food.

131
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,610
I liked the.
I appreciate that too.

132
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,080
And there's something about that.
That's fun.

133
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,310
Absolutely.
But,

134
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,640
but what's happened I think is that we
have a very litigious societies,

135
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,390
you know?
Right.

136
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,870
So if you open it for stupid,
that means people are too soupy.

137
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:16,550
But show you.
Sorry for you young kids,

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm really bombastic.
That means I would use sling those words

139
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:26,110
around,
so what happened is it bad?

140
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,880
So.
So if you open a restaurant,

141
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,020
so when he gets food poisoning and they
sue you,

142
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,410
you,
you're,

143
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,810
you're a lot of times you better have
really good insurance because keeping up

144
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,940
with those medical bills,
if two people get to,

145
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,350
you know,
get a for people,

146
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,870
get a cola or whatever it might be,
and you have a local restaurant,

147
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,270
we'll see later.
The reason that a lot of these

148
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,150
restaurants take a chance of opening up.
It's very hard to make a restaurant work

149
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:47,290
anyway.
The reason you,

150
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,030
you opened a restaurant,
if you're pf Chang's,

151
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:52,000
you've got deep pockets and you become a
corporation.

152
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,560
You can withstand any kind of bullshit
you deal with when it comes to lawsuits,

153
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,640
food poisoning or what are they
franchises

154
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,830
or they all protected under the same
umbrella financially,

155
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,340
legally.
Both actually the mother corporation

156
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,880
that will create these subsidiaries so
that they do get sued.

157
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,710
They can't come after the mother
corporation.

158
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,410
So that's Kinda how it works.
But they got deep pockets financing

159
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,780
everything.
I do appreciate in the mom and pop

160
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:17,480
aspect of it,
but you know also when you're in a town

161
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,560
you'd like to go to best buy and know if
you need a fucking lap price.

162
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Everything has a price you want Walmart,
it brings tvs down to $26,

163
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,370
but but you're gonna pay a price in some
ways and how has that.

164
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:32,300
One example is main street used to
spring up organically in the American

165
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:33,134
city,
right?

166
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,170
You got main street and he had a bunch
of little shops and those shops were

167
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:38,750
passed down generation to generation.
Everybody knew each other.

168
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,540
There's something very charming and
wonderful about that,

169
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,410
but guess what?

170
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,490
That costs money.
It is not as efficient as say target on

171
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,020
one side,
Walmart on the other,

172
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,540
but you pay a price in another way.
In my opinion,

173
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,540
anonymity,
you're surrounded by beige walls.

174
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,900
You have no connection to a continuum.
You tell me the difference between

175
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:59,540
Kansas City a lot of times and Columbia,
Missouri,

176
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,140
when you,
when you,

177
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,000
when you walk down the street that we're
becoming a very generic looking place

178
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,210
and have and the experiences generic you
want to go shopping,

179
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,510
you go to an outdoor mall or an indoor
mall depending on the weather and,

180
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:14,330
and you're gonna find the same exact
stores everywhere you go.

181
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,660
Sure you can get anything you want,
but what at what price?

182
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,380
But it's a little bit like you,
you buy food for texture and not taste

183
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:24,710
and you want a real taste in food.
It takes a lot of time.

184
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,780
It takes a lot of time in the kitchen to
prepare.

185
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,330
Some people don't care about thinking of
a lot of food.

186
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:31,730
I love the show,
no reservations.

187
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:33,560
One of my favorite shows,
we're talking about it on the podcast

188
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:36,320
all the time and one of the things he
did was he went to New York City and he

189
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,440
went to all the really,
really old places where they own the

190
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:42,380
building and it's a family.
He went to this Italian,

191
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,900
uh,
owned restaurant Slash Deli.

192
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,550
That's,
I kinda wish I remembered the name

193
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,530
because I haven't saved on the DVR.
It's so good.

194
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:51,060
That shows the best show on television
that Anthony Bourdain,

195
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,680
Anthony Bourdain.
It's the best show on television and no,

196
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,590
no,
if,

197
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:56,840
ands or buts.
It's consistently excellent.

198
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,820
He's on point.
I just,

199
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:00,830
I love the way that guy thinks,
the way he.

200
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:05,660
He really loves like you went to South
Boston to this awesome episode on South

201
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,300
Boston and the way he fucking loves like
a town,

202
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:13,301
like a real town which South Boston is
and he went to these places in New York

203
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:17,450
and this one Italian bakery or it's like
a deli but not a bakery.

204
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,231
It's got everything,
you know,

205
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,880
it's like all these canned meats and
like,

206
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,680
like a meat hanging from dried meats and
cheese hanging from the ceiling and shit

207
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:26,180
like.
And the guy who was running it had been

208
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:30,020
working there since he was a baby and he
was in his eighties.

209
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,770
He was old as fuck.
His whole family had been by that.

210
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:33,791
That,
that,

211
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,560
that,
that is what we're losing this country.

212
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,810
That is exactly the thing is they,
they,

213
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:42,170
the only way they could do this as if
the one they're stubborn old Italians,

214
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,390
which is a family business.
Then I got rid of the family.

215
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,470
Really?
Why are we getting there to the family

216
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,570
business they do in the end,
you know,

217
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,640
and they own the building.
They've owned the building forever,

218
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:52,850
so that's the only reason why these
exist and it was a fascinating thing to

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,890
watch and the fucking food looks.

220
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,420
So they had spaghetti with meatballs.
All my God,

221
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,000
I want to go make the spaghetti with
meatballs.

222
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,750
I was like,
do I have the wrong gate for the house?

223
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:02,820
Do I have breadcrumbs?
What the fuck can I do where I can walk

224
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,220
into a store like that?
And you smell a smell.

225
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,910
It's hard to explain if someone lives in
Columbus,

226
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:09,721
Ohio,
right?

227
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,900
Like where you're from,
that's all.

228
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,000
That's all city,
right?

229
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,770
Isn't it?
Well,

230
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,840
there's definitely a lot of miles,
but you also have like a lot of amish

231
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,670
people.
So you have like the Amish restaurants

232
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:19,970
and you do have like a different kind of
know the homage.

233
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:24,900
They can really cook up a pie.
I know how to fuck to like rabbits with

234
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:25,920
beards,
ladies and gentlemen,

235
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,780
rabbits with beards.
The weirdest thing about the amish.

236
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,550
Did you ever see that documentary where
they.

237
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,370
What's the thing they do called rum
scale or something like that?

238
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,190
I guess when they're graduated from high
school,

239
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,550
they're allowed to go nutty.
They nutty and then one time in their

240
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,760
life.
Yeah,

241
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,570
they get to,
they get to party,

242
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,070
they go crazy.
They go off,

243
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,000
they party,
they fuck,

244
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,940
they go nutty,
and then they basically hit like

245
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,970
spiritual emptiness,
like the full bore,

246
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,790
like all at once,
crash out most of America.

247
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:58,470
So from every single trash,
meth and cocaine haze and then they go,

248
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm coming back to the church where
everyone loves me.

249
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,790
They're really literally completely
unprepared.

250
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,130
If you grow up in the amish community
and you know,

251
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:07,350
it's a very different kind of life.
It's really weird.

252
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,860
It's cultish.
Youtube to a community and a strong

253
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,560
community with history and also I think
it's really easy.

254
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:16,180
It's a lot easier in some ways to grow
up that way because you're,

255
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,520
you're,
you're given a your boundaries and the

256
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:24,150
way to behave and the blueprint for how
to live your life is laid out for you.

257
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,030
A lot of times we grow up in this
country with no blueprint.

258
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:28,560
You've got to kind of make it up as you
go along,

259
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,800
but it's a funny blueprint and you must
dress like Johnny Cash and not use

260
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:35,630
electricity to the kind of blueprint is
up,

261
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:36,660
man.
It's true.

262
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,660
That's a weird blueprint.
They smelled too,

263
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,503
man,
as a kid.

264
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,220
Hey,
generalization,

265
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,650
going to be racist against the 12
online.

266
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,780
We had field trips to like the zoo and
amusement parks and they would go and

267
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,800
buy like buses and that's one thing as a
child growing up,

268
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,990
you were like,
who are these weird people dressed weird

269
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,300
shit was like doh and hard work.
The hell's going on here.

270
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,250
And they were also busted a lot for like
having raised and stuff all the time in

271
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,000
Columbus.
So yeah,

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,020
like where they would catch a bunch of
Amish people in a barn somewhere with a

273
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:07,950
bunch of ecstasy.

274
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,470
Like they.
They're not all this innocence that or

275
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,170
whatever it's called.
God,

276
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:16,120
I would have to find the name of that
because it's dragged grunge scalar.

277
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,760
Nobody as you can grow up a certain way,
but once you put an idea in somebody's

278
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,151
head,
hey,

279
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:23,850
this feels really good.
It's really Rumspringa.

280
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,700
That's what it's called.
It's very difficult to to stop human

281
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,370
nature and human nature.
When you push in one direction,

282
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,850
they pull in another.
I see it with my daughter and I see it

283
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,160
with the three year old.
It's fascinating watching a little human

284
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,860
being developed and one of the things
you know and you have a daughter the

285
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,610
same age,
you know,

286
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,140
you'll,
you'll know what I'm talking about.

287
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,200
Like you can see where when you tell
them not to do things,

288
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:48,030
they want automatically to do it.
It's like it's so ingrained.

289
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,730
It's not something that you teach a
baby,

290
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,930
they just,
it's autumn,

291
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:52,890
it's already in there.

292
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,780
There's a contrarian streak and a human
being.

293
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,710
It's why any,
anytime you see in any government

294
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:03,340
experiment in history,
in any society where it's a monarchy and

295
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,420
oligarchy,
uh,

296
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,790
you know,
whether it's a collective as sort of

297
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,440
NATO,
we're all going to behave this way and

298
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,390
these are the rules.
People rebel.

299
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,220
It never really works.
It has to.

300
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,100
That's a part of what has made a human
being a human being.

301
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,610
It's getting coded into our genetics,
unquestionably.

302
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,590
And this,
the reason why Catholic girls are

303
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,690
whores,
it's so simple.

304
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,520
When I was in high school,
all the Catholic girls were slots.

305
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
We all knew it and we would joke about
it because in Catholic School,

306
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,870
oh shits,
we'd go,

307
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,190
fuck,
she's in Catholic school.

308
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,950
You knew that when you got that bitch
alone and stuck a finger in her,

309
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,970
she was going to go crazy in your car.

310
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,460
Grab Your Dick.
Like it was a rope hanging over a canyon

311
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,790
and she fell out of an airplane.
Just caught it before sudden death,

312
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,910
like fucking sylvester stallone in
cliffhanger.

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,220
And she's going to milk that Dick.
Oh,

314
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:55,930
like it's the sweetest elixir I had a
girl was telling me about her

315
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:58,520
relationship with the Lord.
She got nice.

316
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,530
We had an argument which was fun and uh,
and we had an argument and I quickly

317
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,364
realized it was,
you know,

318
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,230
she didn't have a whole lot to base this
on.

319
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,930
It was just kind of.
She had gone through some kind of a

320
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:11,931
crisis and then last on the Lord,
I banged her in her car to our theater

321
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,390
in.
I'm sorry,

322
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:14,860
in my car,
I never forgot this.

323
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,694
He was like,
oh,

324
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,900
I can't believe that.
Oh yeah,

325
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,743
I know.
I can't,

326
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,750
I can't either,
but we have a connection.

327
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,330
We connect it.
That's why all the religious girls are.

328
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,160
I mean,
all the horrors back in high school now

329
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:25,840
are religious.
If you notice,

330
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,850
like I used to be so Douchey,
I have an,

331
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,910
an ultimate confession to make when any,
whenever the subject of religion would

332
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:35,410
come up,
I was that guy.

333
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,400
I would be so douchey where I'd be like
insulting to you if you believe

334
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,650
something silly.
It would be not just dismissive,

335
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:44,500
but insulting.
It was such a star because it was,

336
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,860
no one's doing anything bad to me,
but what it is is there's something

337
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,870
about you,
especially when I was young,

338
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,510
when I was 18,
I was really considering religion at one

339
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,400
point in time.
I was very lost.

340
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,110
I was going to join the army.
Uh,

341
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,170
I was doing taekwondo and I heard the
army had a big taekwondo team,

342
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,050
was this kid named Clayton,
I think Clayton Barber,

343
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,940
the,
that might not be his name,

344
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,610
but he was a high level taekwondo guy
that fought for the army.

345
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,271
And I was like,
wow,

346
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:10,180
they pay for him to fight.
All have to do is give them some cushy

347
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,130
office job and then he gets a train all
the time.

348
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,250
So I was thinking about that and uh,
I was terrified of religion.

349
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,530
I was terrified.
Like whenever I'd fight someone and I

350
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:20,050
knew that there were Christian,
I would get really nervous because they

351
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:20,771
had,
they had sort of,

352
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:23,100
they believed and they had a sort of
inner strength I would have ever.

353
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,850
Right.
What if there's a God with God's looking

354
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,710
out for them?
I really would think that,

355
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,480
like,
I remember one time this guy,

356
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,170
he was sitting on the sidelines on one
knee reading a fucking Bible before we

357
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,150
fund.
Put that book away.

358
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:36,910
You Fuck?
Put that book like he was going to use

359
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:40,180
them in.
Holy Ghost was nervous,

360
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,290
man.
I got nervous,

361
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,880
but you know what that does.

362
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,040
I think what the power of any kind of
religion or anything,

363
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,890
anytime you try to go beyond that,
what you can measure.

364
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,690
I think a lot of belief has to do with
less to do with superstition and more to

365
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,460
do.
It's Kinda the same inspiration.

366
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,280
So the the same way you listen to a
piece of music that gets you pumped to

367
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:01,250
go do something.
I think people can derive the same kind

368
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:04,020
of strength and inspiration from
scripture or whatever it was.

369
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:06,380
I know they do.
I know I have a good friend and I'm not

370
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:08,840
going to talk about him,
but he's very religious and a lot of

371
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,690
people would be shocked,
but he's a pretty strict Catholic and

372
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:13,250
he's a good friend.
I just let him do his thing.

373
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,810
Man,
you know it's on him.

374
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,580
You know,
that's what would keep them happy,

375
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,150
but when I was young I was so douchey
about it and really it was somehow or

376
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,340
another,
it was because I was insecure that a,

377
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,850
maybe they were writing or,
or be there when I was really young,

378
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,040
but then I started reading religious
history and go,

379
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,910
oh,
wait a minute.

380
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,410
Oh,
this is craziness.

381
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,650
Oh,
I didn't know I still.

382
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,960
But what fascinates me is I,
I read a whole thing on the origins of

383
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,260
Christianity.
It's pretty interesting.

384
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,393
And,
and,

385
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,680
but I,
I came to St Louis and I went,

386
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,543
what?
That's really,

387
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,000
if you really look at the,
the um,

388
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,560
how much Christ actually said that you
can put it on a,

389
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:50,450
on a four by four card,
but not a lot.

390
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,540
And then you had all these other,
these followers and call for example,

391
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,470
every met him and had this conversion on
the road to Damascus and wrote all these

392
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,900
letters.
The question becomes why though did

393
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:03,610
those ideas last 2000 years and a lot of
ideas did.

394
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:06,710
And that's what I always fascinates me
because we killed the most people.

395
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,060
What sense that simple,
the Christians killed them.

396
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,700
It literally is that.
Actually,

397
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,140
I don't agree with that because you
could say the same.

398
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,140
Same thing about fascism and to kill a
lot of people,

399
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,050
but that,
that kind of.

400
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,650
By the way,
since the Muslims had kicked the ass

401
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:21,310
that the Christians did,
we would all be learning that omahamed

402
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,180
was the thing and we wouldn't be
celebrating Christmas with.

403
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,330
You're celebrating some walk around the
big box.

404
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,640
No,
but I do think that there is some.

405
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,470
There is a resilience to things like
love,

406
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,290
love thy enemy and unforgiveness.
I know that's true,

407
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,690
Brian,
but you have to understand that all of

408
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:37,520
this stuff is rehashing old shit.
I don't have to tell you that and the

409
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:40,940
reason why we are immersed in
Christianity's because this epoch,

410
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:43,910
this world that we're living in,
we're dealing with a very small amount

411
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:45,620
of time.
It seems like an enormous amount of time

412
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,090
for us,
but the amount of time that the

413
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:50,300
Christian religion has dominated the
earth is not the same amount of time.

414
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,970
That back when the Romans were
dominating shit or the Greeks were

415
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,640
dominating shit.
They had a couple of thousand years on

416
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,130
us.
How much we've only been around for a

417
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,830
couple hundred years or you know,
this country in the world,

418
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:01,970
the world of Christianity,
Lewis,

419
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,800
2000 years.
But let me ask you a question.

420
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:07,400
How much do you think,
how it seems like human beings always

421
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:12,401
had this sort of need for to impose
their own forms of self restriction and

422
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,120
discipline and they think it's an
operating system.

423
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,600
Do you think that's a part of our human
nature,

424
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,670
but you think that's a natural function
of.

425
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,970
I think it's very simple.
I think that we're evolving and we are

426
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:26,810
in an adolescent stage of evolution and
we are something that's in the middle.

427
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,750
We are not quite animal.
We know that we are animal.

428
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,140
We know we interact with animals,
we know we have feelings for animals,

429
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,420
but we also know that they're not us.

430
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,550
We know where something different.
Even from monkeys.

431
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:39,470
There's a reason why you're allowed to
keep monkeys in the zoo,

432
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:42,380
but you can't have a slave.
It's because we make some sort of a

433
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:45,560
distinction that we are something
different from them and people will say,

434
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:46,311
well,
that's stupid.

435
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,600
We're not.
It's wrong.

436
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:48,620
You know,
animals have rights.

437
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,890
Honestly,
they don't.

438
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,830
Here's the deal.
If it wasn't for us being so super

439
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:54,390
smart,
they'd all have eaten us.

440
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,290
It's really that simple.
There's some crazy weird survival thing

441
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:02,790
going on and the only way to truly be
happy as you have to be on whatever team

442
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,310
you're is,
if you're a dog and you're ratting out

443
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:07,350
all these other dogs and then the people
running around in club,

444
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:10,860
the dogs that death in front of you,
you'll be assured you'll feel terrible

445
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:11,970
so you don't get in trouble with Joe.

446
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,000
Rogan is not talking about racist and
white black or he's talking about human

447
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:15,750
rights here.
Yes,

448
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,690
I'm talking about.
I'm talking about animals over other

449
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:21,090
species.
I'm talking about the human race as a

450
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,220
whole.
We're in some weird thing where we're

451
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:25,650
not quite an animal anymore.
We're an animal,

452
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:28,290
but we're self aware.
We need food.

453
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,840
We need animal protein,
we need vegetable protein,

454
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:33,210
we need water.
We need all the things that are regular

455
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,610
biological unit needs to keep itself
alive,

456
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,620
so then,
but we also have some weird awareness

457
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,900
and evolution for you is not just
biological,

458
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,180
it's not just mathematics and bio
biology.

459
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:42,931
It is,
it is.

460
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:45,840
We're also evolving from a consciousness
for sure.

461
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:49,710
I mean and and biologists will argue
with you over the semantics,

462
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,920
over the word evolution saying the
evolution only pertains to a biological

463
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:55,080
thing that you don't have like evolution
of culture.

464
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,940
You have advancement of culture and you
know,

465
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,840
you have it,
you know,

466
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,590
advanced levels of complexity.
It's,

467
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,960
but it's not technically evolution,
but we all know what the word evolution

468
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,570
means and it's a better word for it.
I don't mind using anything that I

469
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,660
haven't think societies and even the
world as a whole develops a,

470
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:12,600
their own sort of sense of self
awareness.

471
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:15,530
We are very aware of what the pitfalls
of,

472
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,030
of how to get,
how you get you fall into things like

473
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,210
genocide.
I do think the world has less brutal as

474
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:22,460
a whole today.
Way More,

475
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,150
way more.
It's hard for us to understand.

476
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,760
I always try to relate this to people
when we talk about the,

477
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:27,211
the,
you know,

478
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:28,980
like people,
like I've had so many conversations,

479
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:29,680
like,
you know,

480
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,750
I'm Alex Jones is a good friend of mine
and Alex Jones will tell you that right

481
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:36,420
now that the CIA,
the end up,

482
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,210
he's,
he's so doom and gloom,

483
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,040
you know,
I have some people that I know that I'm

484
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,860
friends with that are so,
so this is the end of the world.

485
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,340
Like you gotta look at it this way,
bureau,

486
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,220
the apocalypse is here but not here.
Okay.

487
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,640
It's on the earth in certain spots.
It always has been.

488
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,700
It's just back then when you described
the apocalypse and the plague.

489
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,740
Well yeah,
there was a plague in northern Africa,

490
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,770
but guess where there wasn't a plague in
fucking China at the same time in China.

491
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,250
They were challenged.
They were banging,

492
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,980
make more Chinese people.
They were,

493
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:06,450
you know,
they were playing fucking games.

494
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,630
It's you have access right now to too
much information for our puny brains and

495
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:15,540
that's where religion and any sort of a
predetermined pattern of behavior that

496
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,120
you can follow as an operating system,
whether it's been an amish person or

497
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:20,010
anything.
That's why they come in handy because

498
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,140
things so squirrely,
things are so crazy.

499
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,990
You look the fucking,
the meltdown in Japan and fucking

500
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:29,010
Mississippi's underwater and you the
fucking tornadoes go through Alabama and

501
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:31,480
birds are falling from the sky.
It never ends either way.

502
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,540
Looking at the view,
looking for shitty things.

503
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,610
You can find them all day and I'll tell
you something.

504
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,200
If for any of the young people that are
listening,

505
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,830
if you think it's worse today,
pick up any piece of literature or

506
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,610
history.
Just take a look like.

507
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,780
Take a look at Lincoln's life and you'll
find that back.

508
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:47,650
Then let's just take Lincoln's.
Okay?

509
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:47,980
Civil

510
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,870
war,
first of all,

511
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,820
you always last two or three or your
children to all kinds of diseases.

512
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,790
For example,
diptheria t,

513
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,450
when was the last time?
Who Do you know who ever died of

514
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,170
whooping cough,
diphtheria,

515
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,200
tetanus,
smallpox.

516
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,730
These diseases would roll through and
epidemics and it wasn't like the flu or

517
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,070
a cold.
You died slowly and horrible and it was

518
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:11,890
usually your child under a tent that you
couldn't touch,

519
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,480
so if anybody tuberculosis,
tuberculosis,

520
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,350
when you got consumption,
which is another word for tuberculosis,

521
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:21,820
and it's just anytime you read any kind
of any piece of literature history from

522
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,630
even 50 years ago,
it is always is always a story about

523
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:26,890
somebody.
Eugene O'Neill,

524
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,840
Nobel prize winning playwright,
his brother got tuberculosis and he had

525
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:34,540
to watch him die and long day's journey
into night is about that.

526
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,620
There was nothing you could do,
man.

527
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:36,430
You know what they do?

528
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,190
Go Up to the mountains and breathed the
air to see if it helps your lungs.

529
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,740
Otherwise you fucking died and that was
one disease of of cow.

530
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,060
Look at polio.
Sixty years ago,

531
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,450
50 years ago when kids were on iron
lungs and the best case scenario,

532
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,670
you're child is four.
He'll never walk again.

533
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,400
That was the best case scenario,
but usually you just died because your

534
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:57,000
lungs didn't hold up and we've invented
that.

535
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,630
That's,
that's the fundamental difference.

536
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:02,600
Nobody that's listening right now,
I guarantee knows anybody who has even

537
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,790
been crippled by something like polio
scarred by something like smallpox,

538
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,810
so the world in a lot of ways we're
feeding in the seventies,

539
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,960
in the seventies and in especially in
the sixties,

540
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,800
China and India.
Half the world's population was

541
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:18,850
starving,
man.

542
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,893
They couldn't even.
They,

543
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,770
they had to import grain now in the as a
huge grain exporter.

544
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,390
So because of the green revolution,
because of what's that guy's name,

545
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,680
one man who came up with ways to make,
you know,

546
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,100
to grains and things more and more
resistant to drought and things like

547
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,520
that are our advancements.
Our technological advancements have

548
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,400
pushed us so far beyond our biology.
It's not even funny.

549
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,930
However,
you're right,

550
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,710
it's so overwhelming and moving so
quickly that people feel like they,

551
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,900
since they can't understand it,
they have to come up with some kind of

552
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,660
a,
a debunking mechanism or something they

553
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:52,570
can understand or at least something
they can hold onto and that's where

554
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,670
religion plays a huge part.
I don't think religion,

555
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:57,370
I don't think technology is,
is pushing religion out of the way.

556
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,230
In some ways.
I think this huge,

557
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,660
this huge,
um,

558
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,360
a multiple,
the exponential growth of technology is

559
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:09,361
actually ushering in a,
another wave and that is a wave of very

560
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:12,580
religious people who have,
who don't know how to put this

561
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,890
technology,
technological wave into context,

562
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,360
tissue regeneration,
all the stuff we talk about.

563
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:22,300
It's also that you were able to contact
many people in our groups and get very

564
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,420
selective on the internet too.
You can choose just to hang out in one

565
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:28,330
or two sort of forums and you can just
think the way they think.

566
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:30,430
Nick,
Nick Swardson does such a funny joke

567
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:32,590
about that.
He ever sees joke about his new job.

568
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:33,281
He's like,
you know,

569
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,200
back before the Internet,
if you had a fetish man,

570
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,090
it was just really hard to find like,
you know,

571
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:38,800
a group or just anybody you could get
hit with you.

572
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,240
You'd have to go out to dinner and be
like,

573
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,560
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna.

574
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:43,840
Go to the bathroom unless you want me to
piss on your face.

575
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,710
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

576
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,030
That's hilarious.
Because it's true.

577
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,110
Feel it out and shit.
There's so many weird groups that we're

578
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:57,620
finding out about from doing this
podcast and you have to talk to porn

579
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:58,910
stars.
You have to.

580
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,610
They hold you down and sometimes you
know,

581
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,530
you,
you get into conversations like you

582
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:06,440
know,
like you find out things like cream pies

583
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:09,080
and you know,
and foot jobs and all these different,

584
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:12,140
like really creepy things that are just
totally standard.

585
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,040
Their standard.
It's used to be fine.

586
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,980
When I was 14 years old,
we always used to find porn in the woods

587
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:21,500
and everyone shares this story is,
by the way,

588
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,390
all over the country.
I grew up in Boston.

589
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,940
I've talked to friends that grew up in
La.

590
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,490
I've talked to front.
You found porn in the woods.

591
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,520
We all used to find magazines in the
woods and I remember,

592
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,780
I will remember this.

593
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,780
This is the very day that the darkness,
the dark side of sexuality was revealed

594
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:40,220
to me because normally when you find
these magazines,

595
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:42,530
you'd find like Time magazine,
you know,

596
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,540
and then there would be like a playboy
inside of it.

597
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:46,670
Someone who would be naughty,
you know what I mean?

598
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,290
Like if you would find what over
someone's house,

599
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,780
but if you find them in the woods,
you know,

600
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,610
like I never bought a magazine until I
was like 20.

601
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,730
You always found them over someone's
house or you stole it from Your Dad's

602
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:58,490
bathroom or something.
But the magazines that you would get

603
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:01,010
from your dad,
but like penthouse if you're lucky.

604
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,960
Right.
They go gynecological more.

605
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:07,070
They show the pussy spot.
But when I was in the woods,

606
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:10,310
you'd find like Hustler and Sherry and
yes,

607
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:12,910
screw and it,
I,

608
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,920
I stumbled upon this one magazine.
It was me and my friends,

609
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:19,820
and I'll never forget this
because my friend Juan,

610
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,280
my friend Juan Alvarado,
he,

611
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:24,230
uh,
he was the first one to talk and we were

612
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,560
all sitting around looking at this
magazine and we peel through it page by

613
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:30,570
page for like five minutes,
just page.

614
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,630
And he finally goes,
dude,

615
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,460
I think this magazines all dicks and
feet.

616
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,960
It was the whole magazine was Dixon
feet.

617
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,020
And I remember this because also it was
the first time my friend,

618
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,640
my friend Josh,
who,

619
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,410
uh,
who was the next one to speak.

620
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:49,880
It was the first time I ever heard
someone say,

621
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,120
what the fuck in a way that I knew they
didn't really want him to answer.

622
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,330
You know,
when you say what the fuck?

623
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,550
Occasionally say,
what the fuck are you come home,

624
00:25:58,551 --> 00:26:00,080
there's water everywhere.
What the fuck?

625
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,540
But sometimes you'll say,
what the fuck?

626
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,190
Where it's like,
what the fuck?

627
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Fuck,
you don't really want an answer man.

628
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,340
There's no way you can have an answer.
There's certain times when you say,

629
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:12,800
what the fuck?
Where if you were expecting to answer,

630
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,860
you asked the wrong question and this is
one of them,

631
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,720
this,
this fucking magazine,

632
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:20,930
this magazine that we found under a log,
right?

633
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,340
It's always there,
always damp.

634
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:25,430
The pages are stuck together and it was
all dicks and feet.

635
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,220
It was so weird.
It was all white guys.

636
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,730
You can never find a black dick if you
were looking for some black dick back in

637
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:33,830
the day.
It was very difficult.

638
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,160
I didn't see a black Dick until the
internet came along and then I was like,

639
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:39,890
wow,
they really are bigger back then man.

640
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,870
You never saw a black dick.
That shit was a room or,

641
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:43,770
or you wrestled and you saw in the
locker room,

642
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,720
you know,
you know every now and then you'd be

643
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:46,531
like,
God damn,

644
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:49,500
fuck is that,
but back done porn.

645
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:52,080
Now point every girl,
you're not worth your salt unless you

646
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:54,920
get fucking gang banged by.
A couple of black guys that said

647
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,380
separates the girls from the women that
separates the pros,

648
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:01,710
that separates the real slots,
the real girls who go in there and

649
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:05,670
there's three fucking giant juiced up
football player,

650
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:09,820
black dudes with logs and their parents
and they're going to fuck every hole and

651
00:27:09,821 --> 00:27:11,730
you're going to pretend you love it or
do love it.

652
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,170
Either way.
Love it.

653
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,420
Go for it from my masturbation material.
Yeah Bro.

654
00:27:16,421 --> 00:27:18,960
You feel bad and get,
get off at this stop.

655
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:20,650
Sluts.
Just got to be nice to them.

656
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,820
And you know,
I think slots are just like every other

657
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:26,130
component and the society inevitable,
you know,

658
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:28,560
and,
and porn stars and Comedians and

659
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:29,200
everything.
There's,

660
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,140
it's almost like this society has a
piece in place to counteract every other

661
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:38,010
piece that moves along with it.
In this society comes if you're hot

662
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:39,540
enough,
comes with a certain amount of power and

663
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,800
cache.
And by the way,

664
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:41,800
salary,
uh,

665
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,490
you know,
and hate and forget about that.

666
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,320
What about the hate you get from the
other women that you know you're,

667
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,070
you're not playing by their rules
on the first day.

668
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,530
What it is is they're just tapping into
our base evolutionary that the chimp

669
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,450
side.
If the chimpanzee and you know you.

670
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,990
Yeah,
it's just total genetic thing.

671
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:00,960
We don't want to be around that girl
because you know there's a place for

672
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:01,794
that.
I mean,

673
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,430
it's,
there.

674
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,980
I,
I often think that it's there the same

675
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:06,270
rate for the same reason,
religions,

676
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:10,140
they're all this controlling behaviors
because we ultimately have this weird

677
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,580
sort of a group goal and the weird group
goal is the progression of technology.

678
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:17,430
The weird group goal is burger and I say
that and people say,

679
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:17,761
well,
no,

680
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,640
it's not just about technology.
It's about social engineering.

681
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:22,980
It's about lifetime.
Yeah,

682
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,930
but what's at the front of the front of
the line?

683
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,700
The front of the line is what's the
latest,

684
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,700
greatest shit we're inventing?
How much does the culture evolve?

685
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,420
We still have most of the same fucking
stupid laws in place that were in place

686
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,060
in the sixties and seventies.
Pot is still illegal.

687
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,610
Okay.
Could the culture is still walked out of

688
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:39,480
their mind,
you know,

689
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:44,190
the culture still really fucking weird,
but technology is in another place.

690
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:47,250
The evolution of technology is a
thousand times faster.

691
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,120
Well,
you know what it does.

692
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:49,080
Technology,
for example,

693
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,870
in porn for example,
it gives you exactly what you want right

694
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:56,770
now in every technicolor detailed,
and there was an article I read by this,

695
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,380
I can't remember her name.
Is this a slutty mix?

696
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,950
Fuck stick.
Who said that?

697
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:03,090
They're.
They're finding this interesting

698
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:06,720
phenomenon with teenage boys and that is
that these kids are now have access to

699
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,970
red tube.
They're watching porn starting at 10,

700
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:11,250
nine and they're getting exactly what
they want.

701
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,750
Here's the problem.
When you and I,

702
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,110
when you and I saw a naked girl that
right when we met,

703
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,680
we didn't have the Internet right?
When you saw and you saw that,

704
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,200
you were just like,
oh shit.

705
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,180
I wasn't worried about life.
I wasn't worried about shaving.

706
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,520
I was just like,
just the smell of think.

707
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,320
She could have a whole funnel horn.
I'm fucking her.

708
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:29,154
I don't care.
I'm,

709
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,430
I'm this far.
Now what they're finding is boys are,

710
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,400
they're so used to seeing perfection and
exactly what they want,

711
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,050
that they'll see a girl and they'll be
like,

712
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,220
ah,
she's got a dent there.

713
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:39,630
I don't like that.
Fuck it.

714
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,480
I'm poured onto the next and these kids
are going from girl to girl to girl to

715
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,900
girl and girls are having a rise to that
occasion and become sluttier and

716
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,050
sluttier to keep to hold a boys'
interest and they've done a lot of early

717
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:51,280
instincts,
social studies on it,

718
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,750
which you know,
what is causing.

719
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,920
It's causing boredom.
It's causing sexual boredom among the

720
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,990
what?
Their articles a week.

721
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,711
Well,
yeah,

722
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:04,480
I mean or or anybody else is getting
more butts or addictions or we are,

723
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,110
we're in sexual sexuality can very well
be in anything where you think about it

724
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:10,450
too much can be in a desert chasing a
sensation.

725
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,620
Yeah.
Whether it's good or bad,

726
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:12,071
you know,
look,

727
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,050
I've been addicted to a lot of fucking
things in my life.

728
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,840
I've never been addicted to a drug,
but I've been addicted to a lot of

729
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:19,030
fucking things in my life.
And there was a guy,

730
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,220
there was one of the clearest forms of
sexual addiction.

731
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:24,070
There was this guy that was in a
wheelchair and he was a nice guy and he

732
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:25,660
used to play in this pool league that I
played in.

733
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:26,650
We played this,
um,

734
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,500
there's a weekly tournament and he was
always there and he had to play in a

735
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:31,810
wheelchair and he was in the fucking
hard man.

736
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,420
It's hard going around in life.
We can't move your legs.

737
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,490
So you started talking to me about
prostitutes,

738
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,930
that he gets a lot of prostitutes.
I'm like,

739
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:39,764
all right.
Yeah,

740
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,710
good.
This guy gets some prostitutes probably,

741
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:43,690
you know,
guys got a lot of fucking pent up sexual

742
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,820
pressure and I hope they don't take
advantage of them.

743
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,760
Right?
Then he starts talking about how he gets

744
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,830
really upset if their feet aren't
perfect.

745
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,770
He got like really weird and I'm like,
well,

746
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:53,051
well,
well,

747
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:57,490
well here's a guy who's an ugly guy.
He's ugly and he's talking about girls

748
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:58,960
and wasn't just talking about
prostitutes.

749
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,470
He but he doesn't like their feet.
Their feet have to be perfect.

750
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,570
They have to be perfect.
She is not taking care of her feet.

751
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,940
I get upset and I'm like,
God damn did.

752
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:08,560
You should be so happy that someone
wants a hug.

753
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,350
Do you give a fuck what color her nails
are on our toes?

754
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,373
Weirdo.
You know,

755
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:12,900
according

756
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,640
to this one book called the murder room
that,

757
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,020
that this guy who was a serial killer
profile of specializes in sadism and he,

758
00:31:19,021 --> 00:31:19,720
he,
he's,

759
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,940
he,
you know about this.

760
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:23,540
It's really interesting.
The society where they,

761
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,700
they get together.
I'm like the third Thursday of every

762
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:28,560
month,
all these retired profilers and

763
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,150
detectives and they solve cold cases and
the rule is it's got to be an ingest

764
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:34,740
case where a little girl was killed or
something like that.

765
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,290
It can't be a drug dealer was knocked
off they find,

766
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,050
but it's usually the deal with serial
killers and people got away with it and

767
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:43,440
they think it's as serial killer and
they've solved a lot of crimes and he

768
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:44,490
said,
and he's,

769
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:47,570
he's the.
He basically wrote the helix on,

770
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,640
on the evolution of a serial killer that
the FBI still uses today.

771
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:55,641
I'm profiling and he said that almost
all serial killers start with a fetish

772
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,940
fetish and,
and once you get into the fetish,

773
00:31:59,941 --> 00:32:01,560
once you get into,
you know,

774
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,350
whatever it might be,
coming on somebody's feet and then you

775
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:05,790
want to then you want to,
you know,

776
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,870
maybe choke them or whatever.

777
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,680
You don't go back.
You mentally never go back to being

778
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,930
normal.
Once you start going down the rabbit

779
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,400
hole,
some people stopped,

780
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,290
some people stopped,
some people will stop it,

781
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,970
you know,
they like to stop at whatever it might

782
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,030
be shitting on your fucking.
This is extreme fetishes.

783
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,890
This is not just like I have a fetish
for Asians,

784
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,080
know a lot of them will start rubbing
against strangers in buses that's

785
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,230
foreign trained,
so they'll take trains and they and

786
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:34,290
they'll just rub up against a stranger.
Here's another really creepy one.

787
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,160
Sometimes they'll find leather coach
cut,

788
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,470
like just really cut with a razor.
That's something called peaker rhythm,

789
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:44,390
which is where they like to cut your
skin.

790
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,390
That shit is a very common thing.
That's where it's fucking,

791
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:50,460
so they're cutting you like when you're
standing in an elevator or something,

792
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,590
the size about it,
you know,

793
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:54,290
and they practice on coats,
but they'll do it in a public place

794
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,220
because it's dangerous.

795
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,821
It's like,
you know,

796
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:58,820
they might get caught fucking nutty shit
man.

797
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,790
It's more weird shit where the fucking
mind is not wired,

798
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:02,870
right?
That is that.

799
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:04,820
Is that a social thing?
There's a,

800
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:05,740
there's,
there's a lot,

801
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,650
there's a lot of new science to suggest
that if you are an evil person,

802
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,660
let's say you're a serial killer or are
you just a killer?

803
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,890
What,
what?

804
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,730
There's a lot of evidence to suggest
that you lack the ability not only with

805
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,040
the [inaudible],
which is the part of the brain that I

806
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:19,551
guess,
you know,

807
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:23,540
deals with compassion and things,
but you also may also not have the

808
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:28,541
neuron synapses required to actually
fire when somebody is being hurt and it

809
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:33,860
causes a sense of a distain or,
or,

810
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:34,860
um,
or,

811
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,150
or you feel bad about it.
So.

812
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,610
So as we learn more about the brain,
it may just be that criminals,

813
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,120
for the most part,
our brain damaged are simply brain

814
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:44,840
damage.

815
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,250
So that raises a really important
question if then you can prove that

816
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:54,251
someone has a lesion the size of a
pinhead on a certain part of their brain

817
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:59,090
that causes them to lack any kind of
compassion and in fact caused him not to

818
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:02,480
be able to feel at all.
And so they have to do crazy shit just

819
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:04,400
to feel just to be alive.
Right?

820
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,740
So what do you do with that person?
What does that.

821
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,491
What does that say?
Well,

822
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:08,900
you can kill them.
You can kill them.

823
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:12,590
But I'm talking about as a society,
if you see that they are brain damaged,

824
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,390
now here's another study them and kill
them.

825
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,770
Okay?
Or how about this?

826
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,130
What if you have the means to actually
fix that lesion on the brain?

827
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:21,950
Depends on what they've done it.
They've already done something fucked

828
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:22,784
up.
You got to kill him.

829
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,670
What if I could prove scientifically
that they're all hundred percent normal

830
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:27,880
with all the ability to feel
compassionate?

831
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,220
You still got.
It's still jealous,

832
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,063
right?
To kill him.

833
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,080
You can't have them walking around with
that guy killed your sister.

834
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,560
Do you imagine if you were walking
around and some guy killed your sister

835
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:36,051
is like,
hey,

836
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:38,120
sorry you just said some shit wrong with
my brain,

837
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,190
but it does raise.
It does raise questions.

838
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:43,400
We're going to be grappling with that.
Another thing about technology as we

839
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:46,580
learn more about the brain and you find
that a lot of criminals have an

840
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,760
underdeveloped,
for example,

841
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:49,130
meticulous.
I think that's the word.

842
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,590
Is that what the part of the bedroom?
No,

843
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,330
let's say,
but medically because it's make up

844
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,400
another word.
Sounds.

845
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,240
Look it up on the Internet like a
regular.

846
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,720
But the point is that,
that's fucking interesting to me.

847
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,580
What was your actual brain damaged?
So you don't have the ability to feel.

848
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,730
You don't even fucking know how to
process that and you haven't since you

849
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:14,210
were born isn't.
But where does that come from?

850
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,510
Because a huge percentage of the serial
killers that seemed to come from some

851
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:19,320
sort of a torture is childhood.
Uh,

852
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:24,110
yes.
But is that some don't bullshit.

853
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:27,680
Maybe because Jeffrey Dahmer's parents
claimed that they didn't fuck him,

854
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,390
you know,
everything is fine.

855
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,760
He's pretty normal.
The Yo Yo,

856
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:33,070
something happened.
There is no,

857
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,060
I don't buy that.
There's no question though,

858
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:38,970
that a lot of very evil people let's
take stolen and not actually not a good

859
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:39,321
example.
Well,

860
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:40,530
let's take.
There are a lot of like,

861
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,960
like shitty the really terrible
dictators,

862
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,880
right?
But isn't it a part of the real problem

863
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:48,330
is finding the God who the fuck knows
when?

864
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,840
I think that you're definitely wounded
some time in your,

865
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,560
in a crucial stage of development.
Probably that seems to be at another

866
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:58,020
theory.
I've heard where people say as you're

867
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:00,600
developing,
a lot of times if you're developing

868
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:04,410
sexually and mentally at a certain age
and you see something really horrific

869
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,510
and violent,
you will,

870
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,950
you can associate violence with sexual,
um,

871
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,270
release.
There's all kinds of shit like that.

872
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,450
Or as a way of coping with something you
can't even put into context,

873
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,150
you'd turn it sexual because it's a
defensive mechanism.

874
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,270
A lot of girls that have been,
except that a lot of girls who've been

875
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:23,100
molested and raped,
they turn to porn.

876
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,090
That's exactly right,
because they.

877
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:27,390
We live the trauma,
they call it reliving it strange.

878
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:28,770
You would think that it would turn them
off.

879
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,020
Some people it does,
but what the.

880
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,270
The,
the mystery is that you see people who

881
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,380
go through the worst abuse in the world
and they come out of it incredible

882
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:41,400
people who give back to society and
there everybody's hero and then you see

883
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:41,850
somebody wear.

884
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,330
One thing happens,
one thing happens at the right time and

885
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:46,210
they turn into.
They're there.

886
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,270
They're in and out of Rehab for the rest
of their life.

887
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,280
Look at,
look at people who make a shitload of

888
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:52,650
money.
A lot of their kids good looking tall to

889
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:55,920
doing all the thing and they spend their
whole life battling a drug drug problem.

890
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,040
Whereas one dude comes up from in an
orphanage and ends up running the

891
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,320
fucking running a company or you know,
whatever it might be,

892
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,860
but you know,
I think it's all really kind of clear.

893
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:07,590
If you look at it like in the
progression of their lives and what kind

894
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:10,210
of experiences have they had,
how they move towards,

895
00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:12,420
you know,
solving or getting past that experience

896
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,310
and what can you learn from watching
them.

897
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,920
I mean,
if you really wanted to really wanted to

898
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:20,310
take the crazy point of view,
the crazy point of view is that this

899
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:23,730
world is really your imagination and
that everything that takes place in this

900
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:25,130
world is really a lesson for you.

901
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,900
You can either learn from it or not.
You can see the whole thing is some

902
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:32,580
grand play played out for your amusement
and in every weakness you can,

903
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,720
you can,
you can learn.

904
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,500
And one of the issues that I have with
human beings and like I said with

905
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:38,081
religion,
I,

906
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:41,370
I get upset at things that I'm afraid of
seeing in myself.

907
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,940
You know,
I get upset at weakness in people.

908
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:45,780
I get upset at jealousy,
I get upset,

909
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,450
I get upset at all the things that I'm
terrified of seeing in myself.

910
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,540
And it's almost like that that plays out
for you.

911
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,280
It's like these are all,
here's your school.

912
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:54,320
The world is your,
your.

913
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,450
This is your path to enlightenment.
Here's the world in front of you.

914
00:37:57,451 --> 00:38:00,300
This is a shaky roadmap of
enlightenment.

915
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:02,370
You said something that that always
stuck with me.

916
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:05,120
I never forgot it and I wasn't that
young guy when you said it.

917
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,840
It was actually kind of recent.
It was about five years ago and there

918
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:14,610
was this situation that I'd been at
dinner and I fucking freaked out and my

919
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:17,190
girlfriend time and you said to me the
next day you go,

920
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:19,860
dude,
you got to become the star of the movie

921
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,890
that you live in.
You can't be.

922
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,550
You can't behave that way because that's
not what the star of the movie would do.

923
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,140
In other words,
you.

924
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,470
You make a choice as to how you behave
and who you want to be,

925
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,040
and that is a series of choices that you
can choose to be someone that you would

926
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,010
admire.
That's

927
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,220
exactly fucking right and that's not
easy to do.

928
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,040
It takes responsibility.
It takes saying no to a lot of shit,

929
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,570
but it does,
but it's also.

930
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,100
It is a.
In a way it's also,

931
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:49,000
it is easier in a way,
make your fucking choice and I think you

932
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:51,520
also know exactly.
I always find people who act like

933
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:54,100
they're really confused and they'll ask
me advice about how to live their life

934
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,810
and I started looking at him like,
dude,

935
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,490
you know exactly what you're supposed
to.

936
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,301
Yes,
but no,

937
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:00,850
it is very confusing if you haven't made
steps already,

938
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,410
if you,
if you're one of those purposes,

939
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:05,770
people that have never ventured into the
deep water and you're free to jump in,

940
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,260
it's fucking scary.
The big for a lot of people,

941
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:09,640
any sort of changes,
terrifying,

942
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,200
any movement and we're,
you know,

943
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:13,450
I'm thinking about leaving this job and
pursuing my dreams.

944
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,390
That's fucking terrifying for a lot of
terrifying because a lot of times it

945
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:17,470
doesn't work out,
but I just,

946
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,540
but they haven't done it.
If you've done it a bunch of times,

947
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:19,871
like,
Hey,

948
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:22,480
I already did this already.
Did that already tried move on here.

949
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:26,710
And sports sports make a band up.
I mean I was listening to mark Marin,

950
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:28,180
I think he was talking to Greg
Fitzsimmons.

951
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,670
Somebody sent me this clip we're
married,

952
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,910
was talking about how if he was upset
with anything was that his parents never

953
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:36,490
instilled a sense of healthy competition
in him.

954
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,100
For him it was always,
if he's losing the game,

955
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:42,010
he's throwing the board up in the air
and then the fucking games over because

956
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:45,400
he left because he couldn't take it
because it was like life or death and

957
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:49,560
that's such an important point man.
And a healthy form of competition and by

958
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,490
healthy one of the things is you got to
lose.

959
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,680
I was about to say,
you got to feel that you learn a lot

960
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:55,330
more.
A lot of times by losing.

961
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,450
You learn what you're doing wrong.
You get motivated.

962
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,320
You know,
I,

963
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,340
I still to this day do a lot of Jujitsu
and one of the things about Jujitsu is

964
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:04,270
you get tapped,
man,

965
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:07,390
you get tapped all the time.
I roll with good guys so I get caught,

966
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:08,150
man.
It's just.

967
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,290
And when you're getting caught,
it's a matter of do I tap out or does my

968
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:14,020
arm break?
Do I tap out or are you going to fuck my

969
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:15,070
neck up?
You know,

970
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,340
and this is,
but by doing that all the time,

971
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:23,260
you get very humble and you get used to
losing and winning and you realize that

972
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,440
your,
the,

973
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,900
the,
the good that you do,

974
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:28,030
whether you're good,
do good at Jujitsu or any other game.

975
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,280
One of the reasons why I'm obsessed with
games because there's a direct

976
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:33,310
correlation in my mind between focusing
excellence,

977
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:36,610
like focusing my energy and my
concentration on something and then

978
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:40,510
seeing direct results and then applying
those direct results to the rest of my

979
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:44,290
life and with some people they never
have any real competition in their life.

980
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,690
And because of that,
when anything comes up,

981
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,300
anything that's big,
anything that does require you to rise

982
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,580
to the occasion or,
or deal with a social issue,

983
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:52,840
you fucking lock up,
man.

984
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:54,220
He's out.
You freeze up because it's scary.

985
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:54,890
You know,
you,

986
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,260
you,
you know Michael Jordan,

987
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,890
they always say he had his,
he hills.

988
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:02,500
These statistic for hitting the most of
last minute winning shots.

989
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,610
Okay.
Guess what?

990
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,490
He also holds this statistic for the
most losing,

991
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,440
missing the most game,
winning shots.

992
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,080
He's also a notorious gambling addicts,
but that's,

993
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:13,780
but that's in a book that's in a book
called the outliers and I thought was

994
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:14,614
really interesting.

995
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,130
Take some chance.
He.

996
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,760
He missed this many.
He missed more than he made.

997
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,820
Now he's a legend and he was the
greatest basketball player ever,

998
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:24,490
but that took a lot of fucking missing
and a lot of losing.

999
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,150
It took a lot of obsession to.
It's.

1000
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,930
He's a fascinating subject to me.
I followed him very closely.

1001
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,720
Yes,
very closely because I'm obsessed with

1002
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:34,880
extreme winters.
I'm because I think there's a madness to

1003
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:38,570
it and I truly believe that in order to
be truly great at something,

1004
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:42,020
you have to give into a certain amount
of madness and how much can you manage

1005
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,070
that madness?
I don't know,

1006
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,290
but guess what?
If you want to be that guy flying

1007
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,870
through the fucking air with your tongue
out in front of the baddest

1008
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,870
motherfucking basketball players in the
world and kicking shit on the level that

1009
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:51,950
they've never seen before.

1010
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,540
Dr Jay,
suck my Dick.

1011
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,070
Stupid.
Watch this.

1012
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,260
Watch this.
I'm going to fly through the air.

1013
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:59,390
How about that?
How about I'm going to do some shit that

1014
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,610
nobody's ever done.
I'm going to hit some fucking layups

1015
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,970
that's going to have all you white
bitches scratching your head already.

1016
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,960
Line used to say,
if Michael Jordan had been on the

1017
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:07,560
titanic,
it would not have sung.

1018
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,890
It would have been fucking fucked.
Every.

1019
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,000
Hi.
I am fascinated by ultra bad

1020
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:16,040
motherfuckers,
but there's a reality to the.

1021
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,620
There's a madness to them.
To all of them,

1022
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,380
every single one of them.
And Michael Jordan is a extreme one last

1023
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:23,300
at pool wants.
Didn't talk to his teammate for three

1024
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:24,134
days.
Yeah,

1025
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,800
I believe it.
I believe he's also got a real real

1026
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:31,580
problem with gambling and any sort of
games and I know that that thing in

1027
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,980
myself,
when I was younger I had a real problem

1028
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:34,180
with it.

1029
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,210
I'm much,
much better now,

1030
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:39,470
but when I was younger I had a real
problem with games and he's got it bad

1031
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:41,270
man with golf.
He's got a bad dude.

1032
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,760
He loses and he doesn't even pay.
Gets mad at people and doesn't pay.

1033
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,330
He owed some fucking golf hustler,
a half a million dollars and the guy

1034
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,500
wrote a story.
It was,

1035
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:50,940
I believe it was esquire.
It was esquire,

1036
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,060
Gq,
one of those magazines and there was a

1037
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:55,460
big story about Michael Jordan and you
know how he's.

1038
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,670
How is gambling with Michael Jordan?
Michael Jordan wouldn't pay him and

1039
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:02,870
Michael Jordan is just this ultra bad
motherfucker who's obsessed with it.

1040
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,530
He just has to constantly get new pussy
has to constantly get the latest

1041
00:43:06,531 --> 00:43:09,020
Ferrari.
He has to constantly be playing golf and

1042
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:12,230
winning money and gambling and
basketball games and gambling on

1043
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:14,480
baseball games and gambling on whatever
the fuck he can.

1044
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,010
Man.
He's just out there.

1045
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,890
I think a lot of hype.
A lot of athletes have so much trouble.

1046
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:22,610
Fucking how about this?
Go to [inaudible] dot com for 60

1047
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:25,430
percent.
Sixty percent of NFL football players

1048
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,760
leave the league and bankruptcy do.
Did you see that?

1049
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:31,150
There was a thing about all the
different basketball players.

1050
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:33,230
Check that out because I think I on
factcheck.com,

1051
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:34,840
I believe that's the statistic.
60.

1052
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,600
We can check it out right now.
Sixty percent of would you say UF NFL

1053
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:42,350
football players are bankrupt?
I think it's like a year after they've,

1054
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,690
they've,
they played football or by the time they

1055
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:47,570
retire or something crazy,
but just see what norm mcdonald bed on

1056
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:49,560
that pack fight the other day.
Oh,

1057
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,810
well I know a guy who bet $800,000.
Are you serious?

1058
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,050
How about that?
I know a guy who bet 800,000 to 100

1059
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,660
class.
I'll have that fucking kind of.

1060
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,580
I mean to win 100,000.
That was pretty safe,

1061
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:06,290
but yet he didn't fight up to 60 percent
within five years of retirement.

1062
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,100
Sixty percent of NFL football players
within five years of retirement are

1063
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:11,360
bankrupt.
Think about that.

1064
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,850
It's because you're just invincible.
You're the biggest,

1065
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,170
strongest,
fastest guy in the world.

1066
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,660
And you've gotta get that juice somehow
buy shit.

1067
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:18,494
You got to just,
you know.

1068
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,161
Well,
there was a,

1069
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:21,470
there was a thing about pro athletes
that have all been,

1070
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,420
uh,
that have lost all their money and their

1071
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:26,300
guy.
So like Latrell sprewell guys who like

1072
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,430
big names,
big names,

1073
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:31,010
and they're broke.
They owe millions and millions of

1074
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:31,843
dollars,
you know,

1075
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,880
and I have this weird thing or going hip
hop sites and I look hip hop sites.

1076
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,640
One of the things that you see nowadays
is how many guys are in bankruptcy?

1077
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,530
Like a half of their gossip.
You know,

1078
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:41,700
everyone's got their own gossip.

1079
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,950
You know,
you go on like baby websites,

1080
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:45,360
celebrity baby.
Oh,

1081
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:47,520
you know,
it looks like they're fighting and you

1082
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:51,330
know the baby's turned for you know,
but you go on hip hop websites and the

1083
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:54,480
gossip is overwhelming.
This guy's losing his house.

1084
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,420
Or you're a hip hop.
The first thing you should do in your

1085
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:59,490
entourage,
just have fucking three accountants

1086
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,370
everywhere.
Just just hire good in New York.

1087
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:04,070
Find a Jewish or Italian accountant
happened.

1088
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,730
Fucking follow you around all the time.
Well,

1089
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:07,350
you know Iran Barkley,
you know who he was,

1090
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:10,230
right?
Be Thomas hearns former thinks super

1091
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:11,680
middleweight champion.
Bad,

1092
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,370
bad by the bass,
but he turned homeless.

1093
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,990
I became homeless.
He had a major crack problems.

1094
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,300
Was it a crack problem?
Really?

1095
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,550
I didn't know that,
but what they were saying,

1096
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,640
what he was saying rather was he was
hanging out with Eddie Murphy and

1097
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:25,050
Micheal or hanging out with Eddie
Murphy,

1098
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,490
Arsenio Hall,
and he's like,

1099
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,440
I had to fucking keep up,
you know,

1100
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,710
so he was buying a Mercedes and the best
watches and then that shit runs dry and

1101
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,380
you know that's like the most transient
of jobs or the most temporary jobs by

1102
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:40,560
the way.

1103
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,570
How much,
how much money do you would know?

1104
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:45,500
Better than I would if you make.
If you got a $20 million dollar payday

1105
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,110
right in here.
How much of that money after taxes and

1106
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:49,440
and Jews?
A lot.

1107
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:50,390
How much do you?
A lot.

1108
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,170
There's a lot that's missing.
Okay.

1109
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:54,570
The God who was the guy that's making
the $20,000,000.

1110
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:55,920
Thanks.
I have $20,000,000.

1111
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,000
But you don't.
You've got to.

1112
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,140
First of all,
yeah,

1113
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,750
you got about six.
Maybe you might not even have six.

1114
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:03,210
You might have for because you have to
pay taxes.

1115
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:05,520
Okay.
So half is gone when you're in.

1116
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,030
When you're above $200,
$250,000.

1117
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:11,250
Is it or is it $400,000?
Whatever the fuck it is,

1118
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,950
there's a certain level to your above
where you're essentially paying 40

1119
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:15,880
something percent in taxes.
Yeah.

1120
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,733
Okay.
So there's,

1121
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,320
there's that.
Then you have managers and agents,

1122
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,150
so I don't know how it is in,
in boxing,

1123
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:23,160
but in a,
in a lot of,

1124
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:23,630
uh,
in,

1125
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,260
in comedy for instance,
you and I,

1126
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:26,530
we have a manager and an agent.

1127
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,710
The manager takes 15 percent.
The agent takes 10.

1128
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:30,410
There's 25 of business management.
Yes.

1129
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,960
So there's 30.
So money's gone for getting a publicist

1130
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,290
to have one,
but of course you have property taxes

1131
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:38,720
and there's a lot of things you have to
pay.

1132
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,250
The bills are high,
but the amount of money that you

1133
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:44,160
actually get is like thirty four cents
on a dollar or something silly like

1134
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:45,180
that.
Something ridiculous.

1135
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:46,200
Yeah.
So yeah,

1136
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:48,960
so these guys spend like they actually
have 20 million bucks,

1137
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,260
but that's part of the fun man.
It's part of the fun is watching someone

1138
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,400
walking around with giant diamond
encrusted chains and crazy fucking

1139
00:46:56,401 --> 00:46:58,470
watches.
And then a month later,

1140
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:00,690
finding out that they lost their or
something.

1141
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,600
There's something she'll rub where you
put your own amusement,

1142
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,720
go rogue and do a comic who had a huge
deal.

1143
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:10,410
He bought a Rolls Royce six months later
he was living in it.

1144
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,390
So who was that?
I,

1145
00:47:12,391 --> 00:47:13,780
I don't know.
That's out there enough.

1146
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,810
Notice.
I can't remember the guys.

1147
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:20,080
Was that I'm a Ford Edge.
So Ford makes a solid fucking.

1148
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,960
Christ was making a big comeback because
of a,

1149
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:26,520
uh,
an m and m commercial.

1150
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:30,040
Then eminem commercial about Detroit.
Some slick Detroit commercial that they

1151
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,230
did for the superbowl.
Right?

1152
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:36,430
I drive a Prius and even my fucking
listen brother the only live this one

1153
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:38,110
life to get yourself an MP.
Three.

1154
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,210
You got some money?
Yeah.

1155
00:47:39,211 --> 00:47:40,520
I used to have a BMW,
right?

1156
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,660
Get in my car for a couple of days.
Greater Trevor.

1157
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:44,790
Running them three.
Get some.

1158
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,940
You got some money,
man.

1159
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,250
I'm not saying you should just blow it
and get crazy,

1160
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:50,680
but enjoy it.
Don't drive a fucking Prius.

1161
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:55,390
You're in the hangover.
Tucson fucking solid car by the way.

1162
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:00,391
I'll be at the Edmonton comic strip on
Wednesday,

1163
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,200
Wednesday to fucking Sunday.
I will be bringing the heat.

1164
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,190
Edmonton,
Alberta,

1165
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:04,440
Canada.
Shit,

1166
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,270
fun fucking place.
They have a lot of fights up there.

1167
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,440
They have the MFC.
They put,

1168
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,100
they put on big fights up there and a
couple of times I've done comedy shows

1169
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:15,190
like right before the flight and the
fucking crowds are great love Canadians.

1170
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,690
They get the comedy that go with you and
they're polite and they're just fucking.

1171
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,890
They're so awesome.
Then they have a good sense of humor.

1172
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,350
How was it?
How was the air quality when you were

1173
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:25,630
filming the hangover too?
It's super bad.

1174
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:27,460
Their right place smells.
I'm not.

1175
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:29,560
I don't mean Thailand.
People at beautiful,

1176
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:33,280
wonderful people,
but Bangkok and Tom's been Bangkok just

1177
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:37,390
by the nature of the city and there's a.
It smells like garlic soup.

1178
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,490
It smells like I was on the top of my
hotel and I was like that.

1179
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,340
It does well.
Bangkok smells a lot,

1180
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,870
a lot like fish and garlic and soup.
If you mix that together,

1181
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,840
it.
That's not far right.

1182
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,350
They're great people.
The ties are fucking awesome.

1183
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:55,750
How long were you there for the only
country never been colonized,

1184
00:48:55,751 --> 00:48:56,960
by the way.
At oil?

1185
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,110
Yeah.
Thailand is the only country where you

1186
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:01,590
could make the argument for Vietnam,
but they'd gone through so many wars

1187
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,310
fighting for their independence,
their bad has people,

1188
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:08,311
but the ties somehow we're always able
to compromise and find a way to be just

1189
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:09,340
in the middle.

1190
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,150
Think about Indochina in that area and
how fucking incredibly volatile that

1191
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,790
always been.
The Chinese were always invading

1192
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:16,880
Vietnam.
They were already knew.

1193
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,510
That whole part was just.
Light was always hard.

1194
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,350
Vietnamese are tough fucking people
because their history has been a

1195
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,970
thousand years of keeping people out of
their fucking country.

1196
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,470
The French,
the Chinese,

1197
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:27,940
the Americans,
they just never gave up.

1198
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,950
When you look at fucking ties,
somehow somehow they were able to just

1199
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:36,550
keep everything real kosher.
They just played the road.

1200
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:37,091
They were like,
Hey,

1201
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:39,580
America will your friends,
but not really good friends.

1202
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,240
Hey Roger,
you guys want to fuck our girl?

1203
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,430
We got great food,
beautiful women.

1204
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:47,910
The weather's great commodity to wild
culture.

1205
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,020
Thai fights,
their fights in Thailand really are like

1206
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:57,850
those old van Damme movies.
They're waving cash in the area in

1207
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,010
gambling tough.
They're no joke,

1208
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:02,830
but they're just.
They're really good at being communal

1209
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:03,440
like that.

1210
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,920
I think.
I think at the root of Thai culture is

1211
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:09,430
this notion of being able to compromise
and negotiate and not,

1212
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,970
not spoiling,
not taking the fucking chessboard thrown

1213
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:14,560
in the air.
Just let's just,

1214
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,330
let's keep playing.
I lost a little bit,

1215
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:19,280
but it's not just a battle in the war
itself is a,

1216
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,480
there is no or it's a beautiful way of
looking at life.

1217
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,750
They're not too competitive about shit.
They have a king still right and you

1218
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:26,990
can't shit on the king.
Well,

1219
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,820
Thailand is an incredibly liberal place
for and,

1220
00:50:30,821 --> 00:50:32,640
and I did a little reading on the
culture and seven,

1221
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,770
eight,
a very liberal place.

1222
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,910
But the one thing that they never,
they have no sense of humor about as

1223
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:40,490
their king nailing it.
And the reason is because there's a,

1224
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:42,200
there's a,
there's a form of superstition.

1225
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:45,000
It's what a lot of people,
uh,

1226
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,520
they're very superstitious about their
king.

1227
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,420
There king is considered to be a semi
deity and they take that shit seriously

1228
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:52,100
and I was there,
um,

1229
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:54,560
I don't know what the holiday was,
but it was a time when you were supposed

1230
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:59,561
to give alms to the king and,
and it was a religious ceremony and they

1231
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,970
would walk by and all of them would put
their hands together.

1232
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:05,120
Even people on the street would walk by
the Golden Shrine and put their hands

1233
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:07,560
together and bow.
So it might be one of the last cultures

1234
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,850
on earth and that feels that way about
their king.

1235
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:11,841
I mean,
you know,

1236
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:14,540
like North Korea,
North Korea is under a dictatorship is

1237
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,140
terrible.
The Tibetans have this notion that the,

1238
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:21,830
that the Dalai Lama is the.
Because that's a religious thing,

1239
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,610
but this is also a little bit as well I
think so very much do.

1240
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:27,650
Wow.
Does the King Do Shady Shit?

1241
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,260
No other king.
From what I understand,

1242
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:33,320
his son is a little bit different than
sun is falling a little bit out of favor

1243
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:36,350
with the people.
He's a playboy and a product of just,

1244
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:37,450
you know,
how shit,

1245
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,650
but his dad,
his dad is.

1246
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:40,670
And,
and by the way,

1247
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,430
I mean son was,
you don't hear bad things about his son,

1248
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:48,431
but his father was always this sort of
sober stayed presence is just having a

1249
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:50,120
good time.
He really,

1250
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,110
he took it.
Yeah.

1251
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:52,100
But,
but even that kid,

1252
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,950
they take their,
their role as a symbol very,

1253
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:58,530
very seriously.
And they know how important and how,

1254
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,710
uh,
how important assemble they are.

1255
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,840
Um,
to sort of uh,

1256
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,880
uh,
you know,

1257
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,330
the,
the notion that we are,

1258
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,370
we are what you should aspire to it,
which is,

1259
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,100
you know,
being conservative like a lot of things

1260
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:12,500
about the Thai women,
like people think well because there are

1261
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:14,630
a lot of like strip clubs and there's a
big sex trade.

1262
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,980
They're,
that Thai women are losing.

1263
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,080
Absolutely not.
In fact,

1264
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:19,970
in Thai culture,
women aren't,

1265
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,560
they?
They're,

1266
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,090
it's not like you just go fuck a lot of
people at all.

1267
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,760
They're very conservative in their own
families.

1268
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:26,411
And as,
as a,

1269
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:28,580
as a group of people.
I've talked to a lot of Thai people

1270
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:30,980
about that and,
and women who were there who were

1271
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,060
working in some,
she was like,

1272
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:34,420
it's a huge misconception,
the notion that you can just meet a Thai

1273
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,840
girl and get been,
haven't been banked.

1274
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:40,140
So it's just the prostitutes are just so
prevalent because they make it legal,

1275
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,100
don't try to control it.
They and they zone it.

1276
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,240
There's a,
there's a red light district where I

1277
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,850
spent all my time and,
and,

1278
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:51,170
and,
and they have numbers and it's,

1279
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:53,720
and you know,
you can get it for $19.

1280
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:55,250
You can,
you can pay the bar,

1281
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:56,810
find wherever the fuck it is,
60 bucks,

1282
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:58,640
you can bring them back.
It's all very cheap.

1283
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:03,641
But you see these disgusting fat
barnacle written German tourists who are

1284
00:53:04,401 --> 00:53:06,880
60 with this like,
you know,

1285
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:11,120
15 year old farm girl from the north of
Thailand or Cambodia or good.

1286
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,570
And uh,
and it's not a,

1287
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,650
it's not a,
a sinful thing.

1288
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,200
And their culture.
Now it's almost like I'm,

1289
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:20,270
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna help this person.

1290
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,710
Uh,
it's like I'm going to give them a

1291
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:24,290
massage.
And so either way,

1292
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,010
I think a huge strength of the

1293
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,190
Thai people also is the notion that
there's a lot of power and strength in

1294
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:32,550
given there's a lot of power and
strength and being subservient and

1295
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:34,860
making you feel welcome and have a good
time.

1296
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,450
Dude,
I'm fucking moving to Thailand.

1297
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,560
I'll tell you something.
If I was an old single dude who just

1298
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:43,050
liked to watch kickboxing,
I fucking move to Thailand if I didn't

1299
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:45,720
have any friends.
I heard the air quality is so bad.

1300
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:49,830
They can't walk around with a mask.
But you don't have to live in Bangkok.

1301
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:52,680
No,
you live in Bali is paquette.

1302
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:55,140
Cool.
As I thought about going their vacation,

1303
00:53:55,141 --> 00:53:56,850
I'd never been.
Who's Tiger Moitai there.

1304
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:58,500
I'm like,
how cool would it be to go on vacation?

1305
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,840
Just trained more for.
It's beautiful.

1306
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,690
Hanging out.
Probably some of the best scuba diving

1307
00:54:03,691 --> 00:54:06,230
in the world.
Is it safe for tourists and everything?

1308
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,800
That's the other thing about even
Bangkok,

1309
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:09,720
incredibly safe.
Even Bangkok,

1310
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,610
Bangkok,
you know,

1311
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,790
I mean,
it's a huge city.

1312
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,610
I never once heard anybody telling me
you shouldn't walk around.

1313
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:16,470
I walked around everywhere you go
everywhere,

1314
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,130
you know all the Zack,
Zack Alford,

1315
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,870
clearly had never seen mad TV.
That's exactly.

1316
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,750
I got recognized.
I had my feet massaged.

1317
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,170
That's it.
Then I got jerked.

1318
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:31,500
No girls for Dixon Dixon feet.
It just brought it back.

1319
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,800
See if anybody want to coconut water.
Yeah.

1320
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,110
Thank you too for sending me some case
with.

1321
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,670
Appreciate you.
Lucky.

1322
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,970
I love coconut water to girls for
Thailand.

1323
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:47,640
You went silent just to see.
So he stopped talking.

1324
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,440
He saw the coconut water.
You stopped talking

1325
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:54,290
water.
What was uh,

1326
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:58,020
what was the nature of your stay?
You were filming the hangover two.

1327
00:54:58,021 --> 00:55:00,570
And for how long were you there?
I was there for almost two weeks.

1328
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:05,571
I stayed at the four seasons sun suite,
like a player when you do it by

1329
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:07,850
yourself,
you didn't fly family now.

1330
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,240
I was just by myself.
Two weeks.

1331
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:12,350
Man.
That's a long time to freak out now when

1332
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,300
I'm away.
But um,

1333
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,200
I don't really like traveling.
I did so much of it as a kid that I

1334
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,130
just,
you know,

1335
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:18,930
I've had an opportunity to go to South
Africa.

1336
00:55:18,931 --> 00:55:23,220
And when you lived in the Middle East,
this is something I wanted to talk to

1337
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:27,270
you about because I wanted to know if
you remember the place that you were

1338
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:29,990
when you heard the news that the prince
was with

1339
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,740
Prince Prince was what?

1340
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:37,320
I just said that because that was
probably the highlight of my life and I

1341
00:55:37,321 --> 00:55:38,520
was sleeping.
I'm kidding.

1342
00:55:38,521 --> 00:55:39,161
I wasn't.
Of course,

1343
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:40,980
this woman said to me two in the
morning,

1344
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:44,370
this woman said to me like,
I bet you didn't leave and watch.

1345
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,680
You didn't even watch the thing.
Just like I go,

1346
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:47,190
no,
I did.

1347
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,990
I didn't.
I didn't want some straight.

1348
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,630
And I'm a man.
I said this woman actually it was.

1349
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:53,460
My mom was trying to figure out who said
it to me.

1350
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,710
Because you ever.
You never know how someone says

1351
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:56,251
something,
you need to go.

1352
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:57,330
Who the fuck said that?
Because it was like,

1353
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,160
in my mind I was like,
this older woman.

1354
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:00,660
Why am I talking to her?
She's had a store.

1355
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,553
Oh,
it's my mom.

1356
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,480
My mom was just here.
Sorry.

1357
00:56:03,481 --> 00:56:04,570
We have to be the prince.
I,

1358
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,880
I'll tell you,
if I was a prince that was a good

1359
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:08,060
looking guy like he was,
I wouldn't begin logging married.

1360
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:11,040
Yeah.
He's got to be a fucking dirty bastard.

1361
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,330
He's got to do what he's got to do
though.

1362
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:13,200
You don't.
But anyway,

1363
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:15,300
my mom said you didn't watch it,
did you?

1364
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:15,781
I go,
no,

1365
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:16,381
and she goes,
well,

1366
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:18,510
there's these gay folks that lived down
the street from us.

1367
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:21,570
They had a big party.
They had a big party for the prints.

1368
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:22,410
I go,
really?

1369
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,860
How awesome is that?
She goes,

1370
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:25,810
it was hilarious.
She goes,

1371
00:56:25,811 --> 00:56:29,350
they were talking about her dress and
her shoes and they all got excited.

1372
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,230
They had like 50 people over their house
watching the wedding on TV.

1373
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:35,630
They got up early because it's alive,
you know,

1374
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,720
it's different times so crazy,
like 10 hours ahead of us or something,

1375
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:44,260
at least eight hours ahead of us.
He'd been following all this Osama shit.

1376
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:44,670
Like,
oh,

1377
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,220
that's as.
He grew weed on his,

1378
00:56:46,221 --> 00:56:49,390
on his arm and he did grow weed,
but that's super common in the Middle

1379
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:49,420
East.

1380
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,300
Did you see the video that they released
yesterday?

1381
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:55,320
I think that they released all these
like home videos that they found at that

1382
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,020
compound.
They're suspect because you know,

1383
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,860
the CIA's admitted that they were going
to make fake news stories.

1384
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:01,750
Okay,
this is this fake at all.

1385
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:02,860
Okay,
but hold on a second.

1386
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,360
You see the CIA has admitted in several
times that they were going to make fake

1387
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:09,460
news stories.
This was after nine slash 11 and they

1388
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:11,710
said to throw off the terrorists,
they were going to make fake news

1389
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:13,970
stories.
As soon as they start saying that,

1390
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,970
letting everybody know we're going to
lie to you,

1391
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,240
that the depths of their lives is only
in your imagination.

1392
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:21,880
Who the fuck knows?
I mean when when you see him and he's

1393
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:25,990
got like his beard is dyed black and
then you see other videos of him and his

1394
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:26,824
beard is white.

1395
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,800
I don't buy that,
but hold on this.

1396
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:33,130
This is why I don't buy that is because
they're right now will absolutely be an

1397
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:35,980
active campaign to discredit him if they
have murdered him.

1398
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:38,530
If they did shoot Osama bin Ladin,
any was unarmed,

1399
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,410
they will discredit him and one of the
ways they're going to discredit him to

1400
00:57:41,411 --> 00:57:43,330
make him look vein and to make him look
like he's a,

1401
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,510
a crazy dictator who's,
you know,

1402
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,560
living in squalor,
like he's an insane person.

1403
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,490
So if you show pictures of his house and
his house was all fucked up in disarray

1404
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,670
and there's blood all over the place and
there's just garbage everywhere and then

1405
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,710
you saw pictures of his beard and it's
black.

1406
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,920
He looks like a nutty man.
You see the video of him and they're

1407
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:02,120
just watching TV though.
How do you know that

1408
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,150
he's got a white beard and that,
but it talks about conspiracy and the

1409
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,500
idea that this might be a fake story.

1410
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,370
They did take a look at how the US
government works.

1411
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:13,840
Take a look at,
for example,

1412
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:16,330
how these operations work.
Let me tell you something.

1413
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,330
When you do a.
When you do a major operation like that,

1414
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:20,770
you've got seal team six.
First of all,

1415
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:23,970
it's got to go through all kinds of
civilian channels right away and they

1416
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,480
have to be privy to all kinds of
information,

1417
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:27,790
not dimension the Security Council and
everything else.

1418
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,730
If you take a look at,
and I'm talking about the hundred people

1419
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,020
at least to have top secret clearance
who all have different agendas and have

1420
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:37,690
no interest in glorifying Barack Obama
at all,

1421
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,240
and a lot of those people,
all of them.

1422
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,000
I mean the idea that you could ever pull
off this,

1423
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:46,450
this,
this fake assassination of Osama bin

1424
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:51,220
Ladin after we've been trying to get him
for this long is is it wouldn't work.

1425
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,880
Even in a Hollywood movie and when you
talk about fake stories,

1426
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:57,550
what the CIA was doing with those fake
stories was they were leaking.

1427
00:58:57,551 --> 00:58:58,870
Then it's true two,
two,

1428
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:01,930
two on Al Jazeera and things like that.
But mainly what they would do is they

1429
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:04,910
want to get information out of you and
you're a young man who believes in you

1430
00:59:04,911 --> 00:59:08,020
are a mom and you got.
You got captured and they'll show you a

1431
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:10,960
fake headline of the New York Times and
they'll say,

1432
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:11,770
look,
what happened?

1433
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:15,160
All your guys had been killed and all of
them are singing like canaries.

1434
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,150
They used all kinds of technical course.
There's no doubt you don't want to trust

1435
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:21,070
the CIA,
but the what's wonderful about

1436
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,310
government,
and

1437
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,220
this is just a fact,
is anytime you try to keep a secret or

1438
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:27,080
come up with a huge conspiracy like
this,

1439
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,770
you're dealing with 16 other people who
have a totally different agenda.

1440
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:33,830
Who would want nothing more than to
expose you,

1441
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,630
and anytime you have a group of people,
whether it's Kissinger and Nixon or

1442
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:42,560
whoever who tried to come up with their
own agenda to steer foreign policy or my

1443
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:44,990
God,
come up with a way to glorify their

1444
00:59:44,991 --> 00:59:46,580
president,
which is what this did for the

1445
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:48,290
Democrats.
And I'll tell you something.

1446
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:49,760
The Republicans are going to have no
they.

1447
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,780
They can no longer use the notion that
Obama is weak on terrorism for this

1448
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:56,390
upcoming election.
So I can promise you there were plenty

1449
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:58,910
of Republicans who would have loved to
have taken credit for this.

1450
00:59:59,180 --> 00:59:59,661
You,
you,

1451
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:00,261
you,
you,

1452
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:01,220
you'd have to go through.

1453
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,650
It'd be basically impossible.
I mean you can.

1454
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:06,290
And by the way,
launching a team like seal team six,

1455
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,420
that was so.
What was interesting about this was it

1456
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:11,830
was so risky for the president that,
that notion.

1457
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:13,310
Here's why.
If you're,

1458
01:00:13,311 --> 01:00:16,010
if you're young and you don't vote,
this is why.

1459
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,800
Forget the platform you're on,
whether you're Republican or Democrat,

1460
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:22,700
when you vote for a president,
make sure that guy has wisdom.

1461
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,980
Make sure that guy is an intellect and
he has wisdom.

1462
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:27,680
And here's why.
When you're the president of United

1463
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,030
States,
you have very little power,

1464
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:31,400
but you also have a great deal of power
and this is how it works.

1465
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:33,680
They come to you with six different
scenarios and they say,

1466
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:36,200
Mr. President,
we have a lot of intelligence to suggest

1467
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,280
that Osam Osama bin Ladin,
who's been protected by the Isi and

1468
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:44,240
whoever it is in Pakistan,
he is living in a compound now we could

1469
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:44,480
drop.

1470
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,450
Here's one of the options,
we could drop 60,000 pounds worth of

1471
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:51,590
bombs on that and create a crater and
calm the place for DNA and see if it

1472
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:55,640
really was him.
Or we can send in a crack commando team

1473
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:57,470
like seal team six and take this guy
out.

1474
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,880
Why is that risky?
Well,

1475
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:00,290
here's why.
Couple reasons.

1476
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:04,460
You're sending in a team,
it is a third of a mile or something

1477
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,920
crazy or three miles less away from a
what,

1478
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,710
what?
What Pakistan's west point is this huge

1479
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:12,350
military facility.
They're gonna scramble jets,

1480
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,270
which they did,
and a whole bunch of other things.

1481
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:16,580
The minute they start hearing gunshots,
right?

1482
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:17,361
Right.
In their quarter,

1483
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:19,280
and by the way,
there are a lot of people in the

1484
01:01:19,281 --> 01:01:21,380
military probably know he's already
there anyway,

1485
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,550
so we send on our team.
If Americans die and we fail at this or

1486
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:26,390
RC helicopter stalls,
which it did.

1487
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,810
You were taking,
you can say goodbye to your fucking your

1488
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,100
election.
So you add all those guys in that war

1489
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:34,380
room.
Hillary Clinton and Gates Hillary.

1490
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,760
I said the news headline,
she was photo shopped out of the

1491
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,080
picture.
There's photoshop,

1492
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,790
a couple of countries,
photoshop,

1493
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:43,300
that's funny because she's a woman,
but,

1494
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:46,340
but the bottom line is you see all these
people including Obama sitting there

1495
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:50,420
with incredible 10 incredibly tense
faces and he took the weekend to think

1496
01:01:50,421 --> 01:01:53,100
about whether or not to move in on that
and that's where the response.

1497
01:01:53,101 --> 01:01:55,670
So you think that the president really
gets that kind of a control.

1498
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,500
I know he does know.
How do you know?

1499
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:02,650
Because because because I read American
isn't a hangover to any biography from a

1500
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,970
precedent.
You think that you really think that

1501
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,510
there's one guy that gets to make the
call,

1502
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,510
that that is how our government works.

1503
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,600
The final,
the commander in chief makes the final

1504
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:13,250
decision when you give them four or
five,

1505
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:14,930
six sessions,
and by the way,

1506
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,400
those scenarios come from the
department.

1507
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:18,470
Defense Pentagon,
State Department.

1508
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,550
They come your secretary of state,
they come from your soul.

1509
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,150
Literally.
There is no military industrial complex

1510
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:26,220
is one guy that's got his finger at the
button.

1511
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,280
He's able to push all the switch.
That's not what I said.

1512
01:02:28,281 --> 01:02:29,980
What I said is that he gets to make the
call.

1513
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,880
Military Industrial Complex is so many
competing interests as well,

1514
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,650
but,
but it is true that there's a lot of

1515
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:37,110
profit and war,
but there's also a lot of risks and I

1516
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:39,780
agree with everything you've said.
I agree with everything you said about

1517
01:02:39,781 --> 01:02:41,250
the,
the seal team six,

1518
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:43,740
the baddest motherfuckers in the world.
These are the guys that,

1519
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:45,780
by the way,
if you don't know as being a seal is

1520
01:02:45,781 --> 01:02:49,350
incredibly difficult and they take the
best of the seals and 50 fucking percent

1521
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:52,770
of them wash out because they can't
handle what it takes to be in seal team

1522
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:53,340
six.

1523
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,830
I mean,
I've read the Deq Marchenko books and

1524
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:59,660
all the dude,
they're on another level of human bear.

1525
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:02,400
They're on another level of human being
boss route and was telling me how he

1526
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:05,520
trains the seal team six and there's a
record they had for running up and down

1527
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:07,190
this hill.
Marc Hamann Acada.

1528
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,540
He ran up and down this hill four times
is a huge hill.

1529
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:12,210
The seal teams guys,
they did it 12 times and boss had to

1530
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:14,130
stop them because he thought they were
going to die.

1531
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,840
There are,
they're on another level.

1532
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:18,480
There's another level and yeah,
and they're not going to do.

1533
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:22,550
They all have different agendas,
but the bottom line is the government is

1534
01:03:22,551 --> 01:03:24,630
lying about a bunch of stories like this
in the past.

1535
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,030
Jessica Lynch is a,
is a perfect example.

1536
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:31,110
There's a woman that she was inside of a
fucking hospital and they pretend that

1537
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:34,740
there was this crazy gun fight to get
her out and rescue her from the Iraqis

1538
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:38,130
and what would really turn down was it
was just a girl in the hospital and

1539
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:39,390
there was no bullets shot at all.

1540
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:41,700
To your point and exactly what you just
said,

1541
01:03:41,701 --> 01:03:43,020
let me do.
Let me piggyback on that.

1542
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,420
Exactly.
Now it would have been in our interest,

1543
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:48,720
would have been very much in our
interest to say about Osama bin Laden.

1544
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:51,300
They had a machine gun on a shooting at
us and you know what happened within.

1545
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:53,550
Within hours as the stories started
unfolding,

1546
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,140
the truth came out.
You know what?

1547
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:59,160
That was a woman was in front of him.
She charged the guy shot her in the leg

1548
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,700
and Obama,
Osama was not armed yet.

1549
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:05,310
The guy shot him in the head right now.
Let me tell you,

1550
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:06,670
that's been a question.
And,

1551
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,730
and Banksy Moon,
I think of,

1552
01:04:08,731 --> 01:04:09,480
uh,
uh,

1553
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,630
the secretary general of United States,
United Nations came out and said,

1554
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:13,291
well,
you know,

1555
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:14,880
there was no trial.
It's a bit barbaric.

1556
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:18,300
I don't know if that was who said it,
but there was a lot of backlash and said

1557
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:19,440
the guy was,
the guy was on,

1558
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:20,910
on,
why the fuck didn't you arrest them

1559
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:21,450
instead of shooting?

1560
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,320
And by the way,
when they shot him,

1561
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:25,500
they had a picture and the picture had.
The reason they haven't released it is

1562
01:04:25,501 --> 01:04:27,030
because part of his skull got blown
away.

1563
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:29,790
Now what they do,
which is really just photoshop that a

1564
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:34,380
blur that out,
here's a kit and a bride style.

1565
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:37,310
Here's what they did.
Here's what they did when the seal teams

1566
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:37,921
to.
How about this guy?

1567
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:42,090
He shoots Osama bin Ladin in the head.
He takes a picture of it,

1568
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,930
he fax it,
he scans and sends that to,

1569
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:48,600
to,
to the office where they're all,

1570
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:49,890
they're,
all these people are there.

1571
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:52,350
They get this picture of a but in mom's
face.

1572
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:55,680
How do you know what it is?
They put it through a facial recognition

1573
01:04:55,681 --> 01:04:57,600
scan right away,
which is about,

1574
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:59,340
uh,
about as they take the geometric

1575
01:04:59,341 --> 01:05:00,660
portions where your nose,
your eyes.

1576
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:02,010
It's just,
it's like a fingerprint.

1577
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,300
And they go,
guess what?

1578
01:05:03,301 --> 01:05:04,850
That's a match.
That's the Sullivan Law.

1579
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:08,160
Then they take DNA as well.
Then they got the body and you,

1580
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:11,610
not many people saw his body probably
literally 100.

1581
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,920
All the seal team guys,
all those people on that ship that dress

1582
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:17,740
the body that read the rights and then
dumped at sea,

1583
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:18,220
which

1584
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,970
according to Islamic law,
you've got to bury a body 24 hours after

1585
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:24,100
it's been killed.
But that's supposed to be at sea.

1586
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:25,990
Well,
the reason I'm standing is a great

1587
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:26,771
point.
And the reason they didn't,

1588
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:29,630
they did it at sea because no country,
including Saudi Arabia where he's from.

1589
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:32,930
We would take that body right?
Because then it would be a shrine to be

1590
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:35,550
a shrine,
and Doug Stanhope had a great point.

1591
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,050
You said,
how come these,

1592
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,550
uh,
they identified his body within an hour

1593
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,950
you had to take these poor fucking guys
that are wrongly accused.

1594
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:45,010
Thirty years to get a DNA match to get
out of prison.

1595
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:46,300
That's so true.
Dog Stand.

1596
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,470
That was amazing.
It's so true.

1597
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:50,590
This is a perfect point.
I mean the fuck man.

1598
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,600
Is it?
Is it really that important to kill some

1599
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:54,310
guy living in squalor?
I mean,

1600
01:05:54,311 --> 01:05:57,620
is it that much more important than
rescuing citizens that are wrongly

1601
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:57,870
accused?

1602
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:58,920
It's,
it's a good question too,

1603
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,760
because it also raises this
assassination,

1604
01:06:00,761 --> 01:06:04,330
raises a fuck load of questions.
One of which is now that we've gotten

1605
01:06:04,331 --> 01:06:06,280
the big,
the big net name.

1606
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:10,570
Do you have a justification for being in
Afghanistan?

1607
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,141
No,
you don't.

1608
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:12,390
I never did.
In the first place.

1609
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,250
Listening to me,
they were in Afghanistan for minerals

1610
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:20,310
and probably heroin over Afghanistan for
the Taliban had dropped heroin

1611
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:25,630
production down to minuscule levels.
Now the United States is over there and

1612
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:29,950
we produce shit more than 90 percent of
the world's heroin in Afghanistan.

1613
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:31,870
More than 90 percent of the world's.
Everyone's grown up.

1614
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,330
That's,
that's the world is big.

1615
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:38,980
The world is big as fuck,
and if 90 percent of the Viagra was

1616
01:06:38,981 --> 01:06:41,380
grown in one little village,
guess what?

1617
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:45,160
We would infiltrate that culture.
We would find a way to corrupt them and

1618
01:06:45,161 --> 01:06:46,300
turn them into terrorism.

1619
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,450
We would have them attack ships or blow
things up and then we'd use that as an

1620
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:51,190
excuse to go in and Jack.
They're Viagra.

1621
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,830
That's what we would do because that's
what we've done forever.

1622
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,050
This is what we do.
If there was a Viagra was luck,

1623
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:58,730
dude,
big d hard dick pills are very fucking

1624
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:59,830
valuable,
right?

1625
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,690
If you didn't,
if they didn't exist,

1626
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,630
I like tigers and get them in
Afghanistan,

1627
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:07,630
in Afghanistan.
The number one way that they bribe

1628
01:07:07,631 --> 01:07:09,460
warlords,
because if you don't know the way I've

1629
01:07:09,461 --> 01:07:13,540
Ganesan is structured today in 2011,
the reason why it's an unwinnable

1630
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:16,270
country and an unwinnable war because
it's not a country,

1631
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:20,770
it's a series of war lords that are all
kind of interconnected and they all live

1632
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:22,150
in these villages.
Yeah,

1633
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,520
always has been,
and it's not going to change the way

1634
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:25,630
they get them to random.

1635
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,870
The Taliban is they give him Viagra.
That's the number one like,

1636
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:30,360
yes,
yes.

1637
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:33,210
They sit them down and yes,
the government's.

1638
01:07:33,211 --> 01:07:34,870
It's some down and they say,
listen,

1639
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,730
we'll get you guns.
I have guns.

1640
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,440
Get them out of here.
We'll give you women.

1641
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:41,140
I have 25 so I can't even fuck them.
We can help you there.

1642
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:45,610
That's what it is.
When I was there for 11 days and one of

1643
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:46,930
the things I've talked to the marines,
you know what?

1644
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,240
You know,
it's huge in Afghanistan.

1645
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,540
Fucking boys.
Well,

1646
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:52,260
no,
of these,

1647
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,380
the forms.
No,

1648
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,161
that's true.
No,

1649
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:56,110
that's true man.
I have a friend who went over there.

1650
01:07:56,111 --> 01:07:58,790
He caught a guy fucking the boy.
They all have like dishes,

1651
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:00,940
they have satellite dishes and
satellite.

1652
01:08:00,941 --> 01:08:03,520
They should bring them porn.
Oh,

1653
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:05,140
nice.
Fucking huge.

1654
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:07,240
Because we're all humans.
We all want to fucking bang.

1655
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,920
It's funny,
there was some,

1656
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,320
you know,
everyone keeps on all these sama stories

1657
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:14,230
are coming out and they're saying like,
people are saying that Osam was a huge

1658
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:16,880
video gamer that he used to play guitar
hero.

1659
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,640
Uh,
and so it's like all these bullshit

1660
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,530
stories in our coming out would have his
children.

1661
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:24,780
The one guy said it was a black belt in
judo and photos of no,

1662
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:27,140
mother fucking.
I don't want to smoke his weed though.

1663
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:27,960
I'm going to.
I bet

1664
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,950
he's got some Joey Diaz.
We would listen to the news.

1665
01:08:31,951 --> 01:08:35,040
He'd have his children's stand by the TV
and when the music part would come off,

1666
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,940
come on,
they would turn it down because he

1667
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:38,130
wasn't,
he was,

1668
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:39,930
he didn't want to listen to music.
It would corrupted.

1669
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:41,400
That's how fucking career.

1670
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,870
What a silly fuck.
The crazy thing is that he used to work

1671
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,480
for us.
He used to be with the down with the CIA

1672
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:50,150
and when we were training the mujahideen
to fight against the Soviets,

1673
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:54,230
that motherfucker was actually,
he never took a paycheck from the CIA,

1674
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:55,050
but he did.
Um,

1675
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:55,910
he,
he was,

1676
01:08:55,911 --> 01:08:56,750
uh,
he did

1677
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:01,050
himself open a lot of hospitals with his
own money and things like that during

1678
01:09:01,051 --> 01:09:04,910
the month during when the Soviets were
invading and,

1679
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:06,690
and colonizing,
trying to colonize.

1680
01:09:06,691 --> 01:09:06,950
That

1681
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,480
got to stop.
If you were going to have a story that

1682
01:09:09,481 --> 01:09:10,410
was going to.
I mean,

1683
01:09:10,411 --> 01:09:11,040
again,
you know,

1684
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,340
the view that the world is a theater
played out for your own enjoyment.

1685
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,980
If you were going to have this story
come to any conclusion,

1686
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,380
this was,
this is the best conclusion ever.

1687
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,480
Okay?
Because if this was a fucking movie,

1688
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,640
all right,
if this was the hulk and the band guy

1689
01:09:23,641 --> 01:09:25,650
just died mysteriously in and they
dumped them and see,

1690
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,633
they'd go,
okay.

1691
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,950
And when you buckle up and the credits
would roll and he'd go,

1692
01:09:28,951 --> 01:09:31,890
fucking for sure there's going to be a
sequel for sure.

1693
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,380
That guy is coming back.
They dump them.

1694
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,950
And then they're going to show you how
he didn't really die and he can,

1695
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,100
you know,
and then they fucking,

1696
01:09:38,101 --> 01:09:41,220
they knocked them out the back and shot
some other guy in the head and said it

1697
01:09:41,221 --> 01:09:41,700
was him.

1698
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,890
Even the assassination was pretty bad
ass man.

1699
01:09:43,891 --> 01:09:45,180
They got it.
They had to come in there with three

1700
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,920
helicopters if it really happened that
way.

1701
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,110
When you hear about the Jessica Lynch
story,

1702
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,370
you have to wonder,
man,

1703
01:09:50,371 --> 01:09:52,710
you have to wonder how much of this
story is true and how much of it is not.

1704
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:57,030
If is it possible that they storm this
fucking compound?

1705
01:09:57,031 --> 01:09:58,980
There are a bunch of Islamic militants
there.

1706
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:01,080
There are a bunch of bad guys.
They were looking for it.

1707
01:10:01,081 --> 01:10:02,760
They,
they kept these motherfuckers,

1708
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,260
but there's no bin Laden.
They say,

1709
01:10:04,261 --> 01:10:05,580
all right,
here's what we do.

1710
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,241
We,
we,

1711
01:10:06,241 --> 01:10:08,140
we know we're doing here.
We're going to take them a lot.

1712
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,160
We've had them on ice for five years and
we're gonna.

1713
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,270
Say we shot them and we're going to fuck
these guys up.

1714
01:10:12,271 --> 01:10:14,340
We're going to fuck up their mindset.
And they got to go.

1715
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:16,350
He wasn't there.
We'd been looking for him.

1716
01:10:16,351 --> 01:10:17,510
He's not that we're,
we've,

1717
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,810
we've been telling him this whole time.
Yeah,

1718
01:10:18,811 --> 01:10:20,160
they're there,
they're fucking hadn't been loud and

1719
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:23,490
that's why we need to go to Pakistan
with these drones and Shoot Hellfire

1720
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:26,190
missiles out of these drones to the
mountainside to fuck all these people

1721
01:10:26,191 --> 01:10:27,720
up.
It's because they've got bin Ladin.

1722
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:28,500
Meanwhile

1723
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,420
he's fucking dead.
We're telling you,

1724
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,270
been locked up and get forever.
I haven't seen him.

1725
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:33,420
Have you seen him?
I haven't seen him.

1726
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:37,620
I think it actually puts us in a really
tough position because now you've got a

1727
01:10:37,621 --> 01:10:40,980
lot of people asking very tough
questions of Pakistan saying you guys

1728
01:10:40,981 --> 01:10:44,370
didn't know he was there and Pakistan
has been our ally for the most part.

1729
01:10:44,371 --> 01:10:45,230
They're not really,
but they've,

1730
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,940
they ostensibly been our ally because we
need them.

1731
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,170
We,
a lot of our,

1732
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:51,570
well they're friends.
We pay them to be our friends,

1733
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,560
but the most dangerous country in the
world,

1734
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,830
a lot of ways.
It's not.

1735
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,830
They have 100 nuclear weapons and
growing and they've already given that

1736
01:10:58,831 --> 01:11:02,950
technology already to Libya,
North Korea and um,

1737
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:04,650
uh,
the fuck else.

1738
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,500
One of the people,
one of the persons and one of the group

1739
01:11:07,501 --> 01:11:12,501
of people and and to this guy a que con,
they had complicity with the Pakistani

1740
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,530
military and there's no doubt that
Pakistan has its own agenda.

1741
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:18,240
They were fucking.
They're terrified of India.

1742
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,650
They use.
See,

1743
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,050
here's the thing about us foreign
policy.

1744
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:22,740
Nobody thinks about.
We have our agenda,

1745
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:23,510
right?
We go in with,

1746
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:24,840
well,
we're going to go into Afghanistan.

1747
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:28,020
The motherfuckers that lived there and
around there and they go,

1748
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:29,760
you guys are going to be gone in 10
years.

1749
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:31,830
We got to deal with what's really going
on.

1750
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,960
So you want us to be mean to the quote
unquote Taliban.

1751
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,470
Like you said,
you know the Taiwanese.

1752
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,240
It's the dude with the biggest fucking
guns and the most drugs.

1753
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,070
Okay.
That she was going to be holding the

1754
01:11:41,071 --> 01:11:43,920
cards after you guys leave.
So after your centralized government,

1755
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:46,890
that big experiment where you have
democracy in a country that's always

1756
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:49,400
been a series of tribes,
you're going to tell me what,

1757
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:52,020
what are you going to do?
Then we have to deal with that fucking

1758
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:52,350
mess.

1759
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,720
We got to deal with that law.
This area was aristotle,

1760
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,270
etc. And that's what's funny.
They kind of just wAit and let us spend

1761
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,800
a shitload of money and then they're
like,

1762
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,230
oh look,
a vacuum and I just fill it up and it

1763
01:12:01,231 --> 01:12:03,930
goes back to normal.
That's the tough thing about foreign

1764
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:04,764
policy,
man.

1765
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,270
Yeah,
it's a.

1766
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,800
It's a very tricky thing,
man.

1767
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,290
It's a.
It's a very tricky thing to go nation

1768
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,340
building.
It's a game,

1769
01:12:11,341 --> 01:12:12,600
isn't it?
well,

1770
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:15,250
it station building is the dumbest game.
It's.

1771
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:19,740
It's so clearly a resource game because
here's our biggest fucking physical

1772
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:24,390
threat of safety ready Mexico.
It's right next door or you can fucking

1773
01:12:24,391 --> 01:12:27,150
drive there.
That life is worth a nickel.

1774
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,180
It's in and everyone's selling drugs.
Goes back to what you said,

1775
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:33,060
how we started this podcast.
You said telling your daughter to do one

1776
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:33,180
thing.

1777
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:36,060
She does the other you would think you
can nation build at the.

1778
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:38,130
At the point of view from the barrel of
a gun,

1779
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,110
you think you can do that.
You're going to tell people how to

1780
01:12:40,111 --> 01:12:43,140
behave the minute you come in there and
you're a foreigner who doesn't speak

1781
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:45,510
their language and you're telling them
how to fucking live.

1782
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,460
What do people do the minute they do
that,

1783
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:49,350
they go,
get the fuck out of here and if I can't

1784
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:50,910
shoot you,
I'm just going to keep my mouth shut and

1785
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:52,440
when you're gone,
spend all your money.

1786
01:12:52,441 --> 01:12:54,420
When you're fucking gone.
I'm going to do whatever I want.

1787
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:56,940
I'm going to do what I'm supposed to.
We only go places where there's

1788
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,890
something that's the only place where we
go.

1789
01:12:58,891 --> 01:13:00,750
We pretend that there's these big
issues.

1790
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,850
It's just like I said,
about the country of pfizer that

1791
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,020
produces viagara.

1792
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,900
If there was such a little land that
produced viagara,

1793
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:09,240
we would fucking steal from them.
We would rob them.

1794
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:12,290
Mexico has got tacos and tacos aren't
worth that much.

1795
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:14,650
I,
I believe that the only thing that has,

1796
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:17,790
the only thing that has resilience,
the only way,

1797
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:20,700
the only thing that changes anything in
life and the only thing that has

1798
01:13:20,701 --> 01:13:25,200
resilience is ideas.
An idea is very powerful.

1799
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,990
When an idea takes hold like the
constitution of this country or

1800
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:29,490
whatever,
when an idea takes hold,

1801
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:33,650
if an idea called democracy takes hold,
it'll fucking change and bring down

1802
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:36,570
military dictatorships.
Take a look at fucking all of south

1803
01:13:36,571 --> 01:13:38,970
America.
It was all military dictatorships.

1804
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:41,250
Twenty years.
The notion of democracy,

1805
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:45,420
even as messy as it is took hold.
It was an idea that you just couldn't

1806
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,370
fucking argue with.
That's by the way,

1807
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:49,200
what's going on in the middle east,
this spring,

1808
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:52,380
awakening with all these young people
who who could give a shit about islam.

1809
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:55,650
What they really care about is having a
better life for themselves and their

1810
01:13:55,651 --> 01:13:59,520
kids and they want education and freedom
of speech and representative government,

1811
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:02,850
which are human fucking rights.
You try keeping that now that that's out

1812
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:03,990
of the box.
Just try.

1813
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:07,740
Good luck to all the kadafi and all his
asshole is good luck trying to keep a

1814
01:14:07,741 --> 01:14:10,050
lid on that shit.
You're not going to do it because.

1815
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,290
Because that's caught and they've seen
how the rest of the world lives.

1816
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:17,840
They can see it with their computers and
their cell phones and you're never going

1817
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:19,300
to be able to keep the fucking truth
down,

1818
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,250
but the two points you can do it in
Cuba.

1819
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,620
One,
the final vestige of that is North Korea

1820
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:26,800
and those people are suffer so horribly.
It's sick,

1821
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:30,040
but but that's the one place in the
world that's still somehow this,

1822
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:30,671
this,
this,

1823
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:33,280
this,
this tyrannical dIctator has the lid on,

1824
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,340
but there is a,
like we were saying,

1825
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,990
there is a tradition of freedom isn't
there?

1826
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,070
But it's true that the cia is without a
doubt involved in orchestrating a lot of

1827
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:43,480
these revolts.
I mean we.

1828
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,940
It's not that these things are happening
organically.

1829
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:50,740
Wesley clark in 2007 talked about the
United States plan and all these

1830
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:53,800
different foreign countries and many of
them that have dictatorships including

1831
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:57,970
Libya and he talked about the plans to
overthrow Libya and this was in 2007.

1832
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:59,120
It's true,
but you know the,

1833
01:14:59,121 --> 01:15:02,080
the this spring awakening really
actually caught a lot of people on their

1834
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:05,260
heels and especially a lot of middle
east experts because I think all you

1835
01:15:05,261 --> 01:15:07,090
need to do is push it and then it goes,
well,

1836
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:08,080
what's that?
Well,

1837
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,800
you know how it happened in Tunisia of
vegetable cart.

1838
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:14,960
Guy got these.
Government officials came and they,

1839
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:16,540
they.
This is how the whole revolution

1840
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:17,320
started.
These,

1841
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,210
these government guys said,
where's your license?

1842
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:20,350
He didn't have a fucking license.

1843
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,680
They threw a scales in the street and
they took his fruit and smashed.

1844
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:26,500
You know what he did?
He fucking lit himself on fire.

1845
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:29,410
Whoa.
And he lit himself on fire and protest

1846
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:34,120
and that,
that proverbial match set off a fire

1847
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:36,600
across the middle east and chooses judge
emotions.

1848
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:40,570
this is the tunisians and the tunisians
brought down a dictator who I believe

1849
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:43,570
had been in power for 25 years.
He came down and did his name.

1850
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:46,630
His last name is ali,
and they brought that motherfucker down.

1851
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:50,500
They brought that whole government down
because that kid lit himself on fire and

1852
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:53,080
it caught fire in Egypt.
Take a look at Syria,

1853
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:56,890
take a look at what?
I'm bashar al a door to door in Syria

1854
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:57,520
right now.
They're,

1855
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,500
they're,
they're being brutal because they're

1856
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:01,450
fucking awful,
but while they're,

1857
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,560
they're scared,
they're trainable in the fucking streets

1858
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:09,100
and it's like the french revolution in
history keeps repeating itself.

1859
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:10,780
How much of it you think is
orchestrated?

1860
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,590
How much of this is just a.
Just natural that people are tired of

1861
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:17,290
being fucked with and how much do you
think is the United States?

1862
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:19,450
I think very little has to do with the
United States.

1863
01:16:19,451 --> 01:16:22,390
In fact the us hasn't.
We can't even get our reporters into the

1864
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,100
Syria.
We can't even get reported right when

1865
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:25,870
you hear it,
but you got like wesley clark is a

1866
01:16:25,871 --> 01:16:27,880
fucking,
what is your four star general running

1867
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:29,890
for president?
And he says that the United States had

1868
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:33,210
been plotting this.
We'd always been one.

1869
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:37,240
The must have some influence on it.
I Think in the sense that we're trying

1870
01:16:37,241 --> 01:16:37,650
to.
Well,

1871
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:39,400
I mean the,
the influence we had for example in

1872
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:43,090
Libya was that we,
along with our nato allies,

1873
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:45,000
said let's.
We can't allow the,

1874
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:49,240
the libyan military to fly over these
rebel strong roles in these towns and

1875
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:51,370
just carpet bomb the fuck out of him and
shoot him.

1876
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:53,800
We gotta take.
We gotta create a no fly zone around

1877
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:56,050
these people.
So in that sense we did get militarily

1878
01:16:56,051 --> 01:16:58,000
involved.
It was very controversial.

1879
01:16:58,001 --> 01:17:00,830
It still is very controversial,
but you know,

1880
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:03,700
to an extent,
I think that democratic countries

1881
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:06,130
starting with europe and this was
actually led by europe.

1882
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,610
Uh,
the,

1883
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:08,771
they,
they,

1884
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:11,090
they say what is in our national
interest,

1885
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,700
is it,
is it still in our national interest for

1886
01:17:13,701 --> 01:17:17,390
khadafi or mubarak in Egypt had been
there for 30 years.

1887
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,540
Is it in our national interest for that
guy to be in power?

1888
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,940
There is a,
there is a convenience.

1889
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:26,870
When obama was in power and you say you
can make a phone call to mark and say,

1890
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,360
hey,
you gotta,

1891
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:31,820
you gotta cooperate with Israel because
it's in our national interest.

1892
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,650
Well,
that's no longer the case.

1893
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,950
It's a different fucking ball game now.
It's a different ballgame.

1894
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:38,690
you're having to deal with the arab
street.

1895
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:42,170
You're having to deal with the will of
the people and uh,

1896
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:44,330
that's going to be very interesting to
see how it plays out.

1897
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:48,440
That's what democracy is.
And like I literally feel like I'm on a

1898
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:52,190
political talk show.
I'm actuallY starting to talk that way.

1899
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,900
So anyway,
blah,

1900
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:54,440
blah blah.

1901
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,160
You know,
when you read,

1902
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,390
you read shit like confessions of an
economic hitman and you know,

1903
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,940
you,
you see that we go only into countries

1904
01:18:00,941 --> 01:18:04,990
that have massive natural resources that
we want to stockpile and control.

1905
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:07,840
It makes it very skeptical about
motivation.

1906
01:18:07,841 --> 01:18:11,890
It makes you very skeptical when you see
all the money that people spend on war.

1907
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:16,570
And I'm not pro socialist,
but I am pro fixing problems and I think

1908
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:19,330
I don't,
I don't believe necessarily in welfare.

1909
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:22,770
Like I don't believe that if you give
people money that you're going to

1910
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:24,780
somehow or another improve their life
because they're,

1911
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,320
you know,
they were broke and now you give them

1912
01:18:26,321 --> 01:18:27,700
money and now everything's going to be
great.

1913
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:29,680
No,
because you're going to develop a whole

1914
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:31,780
culture that expects to get a check for
nothing.

1915
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,480
And then when you have that,
you have no motivation,

1916
01:18:34,481 --> 01:18:36,850
you have no work ethic,
you will have no enjoyment and

1917
01:18:36,851 --> 01:18:39,100
satisfaction,
you have no productivity.

1918
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:44,650
But I am for fixing schools.
I am for trying to develop human beings

1919
01:18:44,651 --> 01:18:48,310
that are going to contribute and I think
as a society and as a community and as a

1920
01:18:48,311 --> 01:18:50,290
culture,
that's one of the most important things

1921
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:52,690
we can do.
Yet we Ignore that.

1922
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:57,040
We all know this and we ignore that and
concentrate on boogie men on the other

1923
01:18:57,041 --> 01:19:01,360
side of the fucking planet where it's
quite obvious that this is transparent

1924
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:05,860
game going on where these boogeymen just
so happen to only be where the gas is.

1925
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,960
They just so happen to only be where the
oil is.

1926
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,270
they just so happen to only be with a
heroin is.

1927
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:13,510
I mean it's not that cut and dry.
It's

1928
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,090
not.
But I think also that the.

1929
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:18,710
The other question it raised is that
anytime you have a country with a lot of

1930
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:21,830
natural resources,
let's just take oil which is traded

1931
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:25,530
openly on the world market and that none
of us would go anywhere without oil.

1932
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,760
And we all need it.
Uh,

1933
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,710
if you look at the history of oil,
I'm not an expert on the history of oil.

1934
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:32,060
I did live in Saudi Arabia for three
years,

1935
01:19:32,061 --> 01:19:32,681
but you,
you,

1936
01:19:32,681 --> 01:19:33,980
you,
you look at the history of oil,

1937
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:34,814
you look at,
you know,

1938
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:38,750
in the middle east,
which was strategic because of that

1939
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,000
resource.
The soviets and the americans were

1940
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:43,460
obviously always fighting over who had
control of that,

1941
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,590
that the,
the arabs for the most part created a

1942
01:19:45,591 --> 01:19:47,960
little something called opec and said,
fuck both you guys,

1943
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:48,950
we're gonna.
We're gonna start.

1944
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:50,930
We're gonna start controlling our own
idea.

1945
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:54,140
But the idea of pan arab islam,
which is the notion that all the arabs,

1946
01:19:54,141 --> 01:19:57,410
that's what saddam hussein and those
guys and abdel nasser in Egypt try to

1947
01:19:57,411 --> 01:19:58,550
do.
They trIed to bring all the arabs

1948
01:19:58,551 --> 01:20:01,130
together under one banner.
It's never going to do that because

1949
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:02,390
people are nationalist.
And people go,

1950
01:20:02,391 --> 01:20:03,770
I'm libyan first.
I'm not arab,

1951
01:20:03,771 --> 01:20:05,450
I'm living and I'm,
I'm egyptian.

1952
01:20:05,451 --> 01:20:06,950
You know,
and it just never worked.

1953
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,461
But,
but,

1954
01:20:07,461 --> 01:20:08,330
um,
you,

1955
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,130
you look at,
you look at how there was so much,

1956
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:15,000
there was so much involvement.
And vying for those resources between

1957
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:17,610
two,
two superpowers that of course,

1958
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:21,200
of course shit is going to get crazy.
Of course when saddam was saying it

1959
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:25,180
makes a huge mistake and invades Kuwait,
uh,

1960
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:27,660
and we come to is,
we're not only come to his rescue,

1961
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:30,840
but we use Saudi Arabia,
the land of muhammad,

1962
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:31,521
that,
where,

1963
01:20:31,521 --> 01:20:35,490
where islam started and we were
launching planes out of Saudi Arabia to

1964
01:20:35,491 --> 01:20:39,750
kill other muslims for a guy like some
of bin ladin that was the equivalent of

1965
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,390
slaughtering pigs in a synagogue for
those guys.

1966
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,160
They were like,
you're out of your fucking mind.

1967
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,650
We're now the imperialists.
Whatever you want to call them are

1968
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:48,300
actually killing muslims from,
from,

1969
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,950
from the original caliphate state when
you fucking know.

1970
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,720
And that was one of the things that
radicalized him when the.

1971
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,490
These are the kinds of things that
you're right.

1972
01:20:56,491 --> 01:20:56,930
I mean,
it,

1973
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,580
it,
there's always the cio has an idea.

1974
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,830
They want to do something.
But when you say we,

1975
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:02,730
by the way,
again,

1976
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,490
it's a lot of different people in a room
that come up with an idea.

1977
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:06,760
But let's just say,
let's just for the,

1978
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,820
for,
for let's just simplify it and say the

1979
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:10,900
cia or the us government at the time,
uh,

1980
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:12,330
they say,
we want this,

1981
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:15,360
this is our agenda.
One thing that they always talk about is

1982
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:20,810
there's always circumstances that unfold
that none of us had any fucking idea

1983
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:23,490
what happened.
It seems to be that's the way life is.

1984
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,490
You got one plan and everything goes to
shit.

1985
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:27,480
You know,
I mean,

1986
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,780
you could make the argument by the way,
that the idea that we killed osama bin

1987
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:32,700
ladin has raised a whole bunch of
questions.

1988
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:35,340
A lot of people don't want to answer
from a political point of view.

1989
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,570
So,
you know,

1990
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:38,340
uh,
this is,

1991
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:39,230
uh,
and,

1992
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,990
and so it goes.
It's a verb.

1993
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,470
What I was,
my point was not that,

1994
01:21:43,471 --> 01:21:46,260
why do we go to war?
Why don't we spend money on the things

1995
01:21:46,261 --> 01:21:49,170
that we really need to spend money on?
Why do we spend all this money on war?

1996
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,290
We do,
we don't spend nearly enough do.

1997
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:55,680
There's massive school cuts right now
that raises the class of massive school

1998
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:56,460
cuts.
Right now.

1999
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,590
There's fucking no community centers in
these,

2000
01:21:58,591 --> 01:22:00,700
in these bad neighborhoods.
There's no guide,

2001
01:22:00,701 --> 01:22:03,630
there's no counseling.
If you wanted to look at the one huge

2002
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:06,900
problem that we have,
it's babies and children growing up and

2003
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:09,990
becoming shitty human beings because
there's no love because there's not

2004
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,760
getting any help and they're at.
We're not putting money in that at all.

2005
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:16,020
The question of disproportionate amount
of money we put in the military budget

2006
01:22:16,021 --> 01:22:19,680
and compared to how we treat children in
this country and raise kids and work on

2007
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:23,400
terrible communities and work on
educating and getting people out of bad

2008
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:24,830
situations and you say,
oh,

2009
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,890
well,
you know they're going to figure it out

2010
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:26,430
on their own.

2011
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:31,430
You don't have a fucking clue what kind
of a disproportionate life you'd be

2012
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:35,670
living if you were born in the ghetto.
If you've ever been around the projects.

2013
01:22:35,671 --> 01:22:37,320
Have you ever been around terrible
neighborhoods?

2014
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:39,690
I never lived in a really bad
neighborhood,

2015
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:43,200
but I lived in Jamaica plain in boston
and it wasn't good by any stretch of the

2016
01:22:43,201 --> 01:22:45,780
imagination and there was a lot of
really poor people around me,

2017
01:22:45,781 --> 01:22:48,000
but we would go into really bad
neighborhoods.

2018
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:51,360
We would go to buy pot,
we would go to do dIfferent shit.

2019
01:22:51,361 --> 01:22:53,130
We would go just because it was
dangerous,

2020
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:54,300
you know,
we were young kids.

2021
01:22:54,301 --> 01:22:57,150
We're close to bad neighborhoods.
There's people lIve in it in ways that

2022
01:22:57,151 --> 01:23:00,690
you can't even wrap your head around and
there's not much ways out of there.

2023
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:03,400
You're you're there and you're golf.
Tomorrow is a classic example of how

2024
01:23:03,401 --> 01:23:06,040
about fucking detroit?
We're 50 percent of the people can't

2025
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,150
read.
It's unbelievable.

2026
01:23:07,151 --> 01:23:10,180
That's a real statistic that just came
out was actually 47 percent,

2027
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:13,270
47 percent.
You can't say that.

2028
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:16,450
That's an even playing field and you
can't say that for the human race.

2029
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,580
That doesn't need to be addressed and
helped.

2030
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:20,860
Absolutely,
and it's not a mountain getting welfare

2031
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:23,140
mothers money so they can keep shitting
out kids.

2032
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:26,770
It's about helping the fucking kids.
The welfare mother might already be

2033
01:23:26,771 --> 01:23:29,020
fucked or programming might already be
jacked.

2034
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:31,530
She might already be on some downward or
you know,

2035
01:23:31,531 --> 01:23:33,850
the addiction spiral,
who knows,

2036
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:35,200
but you can help that kid,
you know,

2037
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:37,870
one of the things that always raised
with social scientists as they say,

2038
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:41,260
there are a lot of cases in this country
where were you through a lot of money at

2039
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:43,180
a problem.
Let's take headstart as an example.

2040
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,401
And,
and uh,

2041
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:45,330
or,
or just a lot,

2042
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:47,650
a lot of the money that bush spent on
education,

2043
01:23:47,651 --> 01:23:50,380
which was a lot of money over the past
eight years.

2044
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:54,010
Why in the world didn't a lot of test
scores in certain segments of society.

2045
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:55,760
They didn't budge and sometimes they
went,

2046
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:57,820
they went down and you spend all that
money.

2047
01:23:57,830 --> 01:24:01,390
Those teachers aren't making shit.
You're spending the money the wrong way.

2048
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,610
The money is being spent too much in
this area.

2049
01:24:03,611 --> 01:24:04,690
Then not that,
not that area.

2050
01:24:04,691 --> 01:24:06,460
And that's the challenge of a
government.

2051
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:09,590
That's the challenge of a bureaucracy.
You your tax,

2052
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,630
you have a lot of money trying to find
out how to spend that money and where to

2053
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:17,470
spend the money.
It's always been a challenge for a

2054
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:19,780
proportion of that.
Money is the problem.

2055
01:24:19,781 --> 01:24:22,450
The proportion is tiny compared to the
problem.

2056
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:25,150
It's tiny.
The salaries that teachers get is

2057
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:29,590
unlivable and that is a really important
part of being a human being.

2058
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,920
If you look back on your teachers that
you had and how much they influenced you

2059
01:24:32,921 --> 01:24:34,330
and how much power they have over you.

2060
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:36,680
This is the person who stands in front
of the class and tells you how the

2061
01:24:36,681 --> 01:24:38,620
fucking world works and when you're a
kid,

2062
01:24:38,621 --> 01:24:42,310
that's a huge,
huge responsibility that many times is

2063
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:45,790
bestowed on idiots.
It's bestowed on idiots and they took

2064
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:48,070
this job because they couldn't get
another job and they're fucking,

2065
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,310
by the way,
try tribe with the teacher's unions and

2066
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:54,490
then just try getting.
Just try firing a teacher who has tenure

2067
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,370
because they've been teaching for three
years and a lot of districts just try

2068
01:24:57,371 --> 01:25:00,890
now in the high schools they get tenure
like so hard to find our schools.

2069
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:03,490
yes,
it is so well there's a docuMentary

2070
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,060
called waiting for superman,
but forget that there's an article just

2071
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:11,020
now in the New York times about about.
I'm trying to get a.

2072
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:14,950
I think it was in the state of Ohio,
just trying to get one law passed one

2073
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:18,220
law,
one law that makes it harder for a

2074
01:25:18,221 --> 01:25:22,450
teacher to get tenure or easier to hire
a high quality teacher in place.

2075
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:27,450
If someone was not performing,
you weren't dealing with fucking 65

2076
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:30,130
different interests with a lot of
lobbying power.

2077
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:34,660
Starting with the teacher's union.
That also then has a subsIdiary called

2078
01:25:34,661 --> 01:25:38,170
the chicago teacher's union that has a
subsidiary called the county teachers

2079
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:42,490
union and you're dealing with fucking
the reality of trying to make a law go

2080
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:44,200
through.
Holy shit,

2081
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:45,330
man.
Holy shit.

2082
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:47,650
Talk to a senator sometime.
Say,

2083
01:25:47,651 --> 01:25:49,360
hey,
I want to get a law passed and it's a

2084
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:52,090
simple one.
Talk to him and see how long it takes

2085
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:54,880
and how many years and how many people
you got to pay off and how many people.

2086
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:58,600
You got to convince them you have to
have a homicide because a lot of people

2087
01:25:58,601 --> 01:26:00,790
go.
The problem with the law as two things.

2088
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:02,620
You pass a law,
it does one thing.

2089
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:04,200
It puts a whole bunch of people out of
business

2090
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:08,420
and a whole bunch of other people in
business and any law you pass doesn't go

2091
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:12,650
away in this country and you know why?
Because a whole cottage industry grows

2092
01:26:12,651 --> 01:26:14,900
up around that law.
That's why.

2093
01:26:15,010 --> 01:26:16,610
Oh yeah,
we've talked about that many times.

2094
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:19,610
Especially when it comes to drugs.
I mean there's a reason why people are

2095
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:23,690
still trying to keep marijuana illegal.
We have more than 50 percent of the

2096
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:27,800
people in prison today in this country
are in prison for nonviolent drug

2097
01:26:27,801 --> 01:26:32,090
offenses and there are a tremendous
amount of private prisons in this

2098
01:26:32,091 --> 01:26:33,120
country.
We're on pain.

2099
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:36,740
It's a business and we have to wrap our
heads around the fact that there's some

2100
01:26:36,741 --> 01:26:40,130
sort of a creepy situations happen where
there's a lot of money and keeping

2101
01:26:40,131 --> 01:26:43,550
people in jail and because of that there
are make no doubt about it.

2102
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:46,440
The prison guard unions and all these,
you know,

2103
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:49,730
various law enforcement unions,
they're not lobbying to keep marijuana

2104
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,440
to make marijuana legal.

2105
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,470
They don't want it at all because it's a
part of their economy.

2106
01:26:54,471 --> 01:26:56,990
It's a part of their,
their whole system situation that this

2107
01:26:56,991 --> 01:27:01,090
is what happens in life is know a lot of
people have a vested interest.

2108
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,650
That's why being a politician or a
president and that the old saying,

2109
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,000
when you're a president,
you make,

2110
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:06,770
you make one decision,
you,

2111
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:08,750
you,
you make 50 percent of the people happy.

2112
01:27:08,751 --> 01:27:11,240
And then another 58 percent of people
out there hate your guts.

2113
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:13,490
It.
There's no way to avoid that when you

2114
01:27:13,491 --> 01:27:17,360
have power tenure.
Tenure for a teacher is almost.

2115
01:27:17,361 --> 01:27:20,120
It's has some of the elements of
intellectual,

2116
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,410
um,
welfare in a great way to put it in

2117
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:27,650
that,
you know what I mean in that it sounds

2118
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:29,770
like a good idea.
Like what you're gonna do is you're

2119
01:27:29,771 --> 01:27:33,560
gonna make it so you can't get fired.
So you are allowed to be free with your

2120
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:36,290
ideas and you don't have to worry about
the repercussions of your,

2121
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,220
of your free thinking.

2122
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:40,880
And this is gonna promote thought,
but the problem with that is when you

2123
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:43,130
know that you can't get fired,
you become a client.

2124
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:45,290
And that's just what people do.
It's natural.

2125
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:46,124
It's just like,
well,

2126
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:48,050
I was doing standup and I think it was
Kansas city.

2127
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:49,670
I talked to a principal that came to my
show.

2128
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:52,040
I said,
give me your take on the education

2129
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:52,671
system.
They said,

2130
01:27:52,671 --> 01:27:54,020
education system's fine.
I said,

2131
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:54,800
what do you mean?
He goes,

2132
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,150
education,
my school is amazing,

2133
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,190
but you know what the problem is
parents,

2134
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:01,280
a lot of parents suck.
They suck.

2135
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:04,850
And a lot of it is this culture that
doesn't put a premium on education and a

2136
01:28:04,851 --> 01:28:07,250
lot of places.
The idea that you gotta work your

2137
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:10,610
fucking ass off against insurmountable
odds for anything.

2138
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:11,480
All that stuff.
I mean,

2139
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:14,480
you know,
well kids in where we live with an even

2140
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:17,420
trickier element,
there's this fucking weird escape clause

2141
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:20,990
where you can become famous for nothing
and then you get millions.

2142
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,370
And so instead of working your ass off
for almost nothing after taxes,

2143
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:29,840
you look at kim kardashian who just fuck
somebody and makes a video of it.

2144
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:32,090
And then gets a tv show where they
follow her around,

2145
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,220
she does nothing to contribute,
she's not saying anything,

2146
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:36,290
but yet she's making millions of dollars
and good for her.

2147
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:37,880
You know,
I'm not hating on her good for her,

2148
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:40,880
but to kids that all of a sudden becomes
this goal,

2149
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:45,260
this weird fucking weird like clause in
the contract.

2150
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:49,230
Since we're little escape clause and a
few people find it and they,

2151
01:28:49,231 --> 01:28:51,740
they get through the system and all of a
sudden look at this person making

2152
01:28:51,741 --> 01:28:54,050
millions of dollars for it.
Kim kardashians made something like

2153
01:28:54,051 --> 01:28:56,720
$60,000,000 last year.
Fucking insane.

2154
01:28:57,010 --> 01:28:58,220
It's crazy money.
You know what I mean?

2155
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:00,110
She's an.
Every time I go to the fucking airport

2156
01:29:00,111 --> 01:29:02,160
and I throw my keys in the bin,

2157
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:06,270
I see her in some sketches ad with her
fat ass ticket out and she's wearing

2158
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:08,190
some sneakers.
It's supposed to make you fast though,

2159
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:09,030
by the way.
I like her.

2160
01:29:09,031 --> 01:29:11,440
I said even real,
totally real lever.

2161
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:13,170
Breasts are real.
But really?

2162
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,390
Yes,
I think you'd believe in santa claus to

2163
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:19,080
mother fucker carb.
That is my type,

2164
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,580
but she's always getting her face carved
up.

2165
01:29:20,581 --> 01:29:21,500
Why don't you?
Yes,

2166
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,360
she is.
There's been a bunch of photos.

2167
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:26,640
Any credentials.
You're crazy.

2168
01:29:26,641 --> 01:29:28,140
You haven't seen the photos?
No.

2169
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:29,580
Dude.
You got to look online.

2170
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:32,610
You're going to make them.
You made a mistake or face all puffy.

2171
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,630
Looking like a cat.
woman was like right after she had a

2172
01:29:36,631 --> 01:29:37,770
procedure pond.
Yes,

2173
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:39,570
without a doubt.
And I had to them make makeup.

2174
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:42,990
I worked with her on how I met your
mother and she wouldn't give a fuck

2175
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:43,824
where you work.
She looked.

2176
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:44,520
LIsten,
pal.

2177
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:49,520
This tossed girls had,
had to start like this girl is a blast.

2178
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:51,630
Exert who?
Without a doubt.

2179
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:53,130
And you know,
whatever man.

2180
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,330
I mean,
if that's your business,

2181
01:29:54,331 --> 01:29:56,040
your business is staying hot.
I guess.

2182
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:58,020
What you gotta do what you gotta do like
26,

2183
01:29:58,021 --> 01:29:58,960
right?
She's fine.

2184
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:00,510
She's delicious.
Let me see like that.

2185
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:07,120
What are you doing?
You're looking for the photos here.

2186
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:09,030
We'll uh,
we'll find them and I'll show them to

2187
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:10,620
you later because this is going to be a
pain in the ass.

2188
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,610
But what my point is,
you and I have both talked about this

2189
01:30:14,611 --> 01:30:16,530
and I did get out of here for a little
while,

2190
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,100
but moving to somewhere where that's not
an influence.

2191
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:24,510
Is that even possible anymore though?
Because that influence is sort of like

2192
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,520
all over the country now.
I don't know.

2193
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:27,180
I,
I,

2194
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,740
that's a good question.
I think though,

2195
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:31,320
at the end of the day,
you're still gonna have a lot of people

2196
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:35,430
who hold on to what's important because
life is basically a kick in the nuts and

2197
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:37,050
it's going to teach you that shit.
You know,

2198
01:30:37,051 --> 01:30:39,330
you still got to compete.
You've still got to fight gravity.

2199
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:41,880
You still got to find fulfillment and
accomplishment.

2200
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:45,480
And the only way to accomplish something
like a black belt in jujitsu is fucking

2201
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:48,870
roll all the time for four or five,
six or seven or 10 years.

2202
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,940
If you want a black belt,
that's what it takes.

2203
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:53,960
If you want to know that you truly are,
you know somebody that can tie somebody

2204
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:56,400
in a knot.
And I'm speaking metaphorically in

2205
01:30:56,401 --> 01:30:58,410
anything.
It takes a long fucking time.

2206
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,060
You want to be a Good stand up.
You want to be.

2207
01:31:00,061 --> 01:31:01,500
You want to make people laugh all over
the country.

2208
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:04,690
I'll see in 10 years minimum.
I mean in a way,

2209
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:08,880
if you're lucky in a way life is going
to life kind of sorts itself out so

2210
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:11,280
people worry about I think.
I think it's always been,

2211
01:31:11,281 --> 01:31:12,660
well these people are,
you know,

2212
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:14,550
I mean,
I don't know of any story in the world

2213
01:31:14,551 --> 01:31:15,830
or any leader in the world.

2214
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:19,770
It didn't complain that his followers
for the most part were retards and,

2215
01:31:19,771 --> 01:31:20,604
and,
you know,

2216
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:22,680
oh,
to change and get people to understand

2217
01:31:22,681 --> 01:31:26,010
what's important.
That's what every religious leader of,

2218
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,920
from from christ on,
for moses,

2219
01:31:28,921 --> 01:31:30,380
for god's sake,
5,000 years ago,

2220
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:33,900
why my people don't know what's
important here are the commandments.

2221
01:31:33,901 --> 01:31:34,890
You pagans,
you know,

2222
01:31:34,891 --> 01:31:38,240
it's always been that.
It's always been people who are older

2223
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:40,680
always been like,
you fucking kids are partying too much.

2224
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,480
Stop with all the fucking,
the drinking,

2225
01:31:42,481 --> 01:31:43,670
the booze and then,
and you know,

2226
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,790
and,
and the drugs.

2227
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,740
Here's what's important.
Yeah,

2228
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,390
if you don't,
you're going to get struck down by

2229
01:31:48,391 --> 01:31:50,400
lightning.
So the I'm going to scare the shit out

2230
01:31:50,401 --> 01:31:51,450
of you for your own good.
Right?

2231
01:31:51,451 --> 01:31:54,210
And ultimately all of these things are
in place so that we can have this

2232
01:31:54,211 --> 01:31:57,930
society so that people can survive so
that people can keep breeding so we can

2233
01:31:57,931 --> 01:31:59,710
continue doing what doing,

2234
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,470
which is sort of centers around
technology,

2235
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:04,660
social animal.
We've alwaYs,

2236
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,600
we've always had a war with nature
anyway.

2237
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:11,140
That's kinda like what we're the only
animal that has a symbiotic relationship

2238
01:32:11,141 --> 01:32:14,050
with an artificial life.
And that artificial life is technology.

2239
01:32:14,051 --> 01:32:16,300
You know,
you could say technology is not alive,

2240
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:20,410
but I mean we use the word evolution to
culturally earlier use the word

2241
01:32:20,411 --> 01:32:24,160
evolution for machines and if you look
at simple machines that were around,

2242
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:24,671
you know,
50,

2243
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:28,990
60 years ago and you look at the complex
machines now with the microchips that

2244
01:32:28,991 --> 01:32:31,750
are powering your fucking cell phone.
And we're where this is all headed in

2245
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:36,010
some sort of a weird direction.
We are inexorably connected to this

2246
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:39,850
technology.
Wouldn't inexorably inexorably connected

2247
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:44,851
to this technology.
Inevitably in our society is connected

2248
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:46,450
to.
I mean this was what the unabomber was

2249
01:32:46,451 --> 01:32:49,540
terrified about.
This is when he took his manifesto.

2250
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:53,800
Technology will get to a point where it
no longer has a respect for its

2251
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:56,430
biological heritage.
People can say it's not a live forum.

2252
01:32:56,431 --> 01:32:57,670
It's not a life form.
You're right.

2253
01:32:57,671 --> 01:32:58,510
You're right.
It's not.

2254
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:00,600
There's no blood in it and there's no
tissues cells,

2255
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:03,320
but what is it?
It's something that's growing in a va.

2256
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:05,940
You can say that it's not a life form,
but what is it?

2257
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:08,830
A fucking human being.
A human being iS some sort of a weird

2258
01:33:08,831 --> 01:33:11,560
biological computer that's riddled with
bacteria.

2259
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,620
That's what we that with synthetic dna
coming up with.

2260
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:16,960
We're not just living,
we're coming up with living.

2261
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:19,840
We're coming up with manmade bacteria
basically,

2262
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,210
and you know,
this is one of those conversations that

2263
01:33:22,211 --> 01:33:25,210
inevitably when whenever we have this
sort of conversation on the message,

2264
01:33:25,211 --> 01:33:27,740
on the podcast,
on my message board,

2265
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:30,940
someone will come up and go this fucking
bullshit stoned hippy talk.

2266
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:35,200
It's always some aggro fuckhead with a
poor argument and they get upset about

2267
01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:37,510
it,
but the the bottom line is with all this

2268
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:38,820
hippie talk is,
you know,

2269
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:40,390
everyone's like,
why are you thinking about that?

2270
01:33:40,391 --> 01:33:41,440
Why are you thinking about like,
well,

2271
01:33:41,441 --> 01:33:43,210
where's it all going?
We're just all going,

2272
01:33:43,211 --> 01:33:44,200
man.
It's going nowhere.

2273
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:45,460
Shut up,
go to work.

2274
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:49,120
The reality is that something is
happening and for whatever reason we

2275
01:33:49,121 --> 01:33:51,700
have an instinct to ignore it.
It's not hippy talk anyway.

2276
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:52,990
By the way,
you think a tippy talk,

2277
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:56,020
take a look at what computer scientists
are talking about.

2278
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,400
Computer scientists and scientists in
general are talking about evolution in,

2279
01:34:01,401 --> 01:34:06,401
in terms of human beings can control and
are controlling their own evolution,

2280
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:11,440
so it's not hippy talk at all.
In fAct it's called hard scientific

2281
01:34:11,441 --> 01:34:12,980
talk.
It is cold outside dog,

2282
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:15,100
but it's also still radical theoretic.

2283
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,570
It's also stoner talk.
It's also the kind of things but the.

2284
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:22,510
That's why we did so awesome you fuck,
but as we started talking in 20 years,

2285
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:26,300
we are going to like it or not have to
contend with tech,

2286
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:30,970
technological advances that are,
that are so far beyond what most of us

2287
01:34:30,971 --> 01:34:34,300
are dealing with today.
Biocompatible technology,

2288
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:37,250
things that fit into your body that make
you remember fast.

2289
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,400
Keep you awake longer.
Placement parts.

2290
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,990
Heinz bionic,
man,

2291
01:34:40,991 --> 01:34:41,824
bro.
Sure.

2292
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,671
So,
so,

2293
01:34:42,671 --> 01:34:46,930
so these are realities that are going to
affect how you make a living,

2294
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:50,020
what you talk about,
what you listened to,

2295
01:34:50,021 --> 01:34:53,770
what your children are influenced by.
So anybody who thinks they can stay out

2296
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:57,650
of this debate or even this discussion
is kitten themselves.

2297
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,940
Man,
you're kidding yourself.

2298
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:03,290
He does have an air of silliness to it.
It's got an air of man.

2299
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:05,890
You know there's something to it when
you're considering,

2300
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:06,681
you know,
these,

2301
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:10,700
these really fantastical possibilities
and probabilities of the exponential

2302
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:11,690
growth of technology.

2303
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:14,040
It does have this sort of silliness to
it.

2304
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:17,420
That's kind of where we're spiritual
conversation comes in with the notion

2305
01:35:17,421 --> 01:35:20,000
that yes,
we have all these technical logical

2306
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:22,250
advances,
but the same old questions that a human

2307
01:35:22,251 --> 01:35:26,600
being's going to have to answer for
himself are still gonna exist sort of

2308
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,553
one way,
you know,

2309
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:31,130
I wonder if it's there for the same
reason why when your dick is hard,

2310
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,140
you don't even think about putting a
condom on.

2311
01:35:33,141 --> 01:35:34,870
you just stick it in there because.
Because yeah,

2312
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,090
just whatever,
just getting up,

2313
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,250
fuck.
I made a kid.

2314
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,650
It's almost like it's designed that way
and our,

2315
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:41,600
our mass,
you know,

2316
01:35:41,601 --> 01:35:43,220
the,
the huge percentage of the population is

2317
01:35:43,221 --> 01:35:47,330
not thinking about the eventual upcoming
technological singularity.

2318
01:35:47,331 --> 01:35:48,510
TheY're just not.
And,

2319
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:49,880
and if you bring it up,
it's like,

2320
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,740
oh,
right,

2321
01:35:51,741 --> 01:35:52,101
right,
right,

2322
01:35:52,101 --> 01:35:54,290
right.
But I wonder if that's there for the

2323
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:54,890
same reason.

2324
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:58,820
It's the same sort of an instinct that
makes the hard dick stick it in without

2325
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,030
a condom to make sure it happens anyway.
It's like this crazy instincts.

2326
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:04,670
Oh fuck,
you just don't come and tell me.

2327
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:05,320
Okay.
Okay,

2328
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:06,420
well shit.
You know,

2329
01:36:06,430 --> 01:36:08,980
it's like,
it's almost like it's engineered into

2330
01:36:09,190 --> 01:36:11,350
reasonable.
Whenever you start talking about if it's

2331
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,650
a guy gets up and says,
well,

2332
01:36:12,651 --> 01:36:14,570
climate change and sea levels are
rising.

2333
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,490
You talked to me about that talk,
talk to me.

2334
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,410
I go,
that's too big to think about and I

2335
01:36:18,411 --> 01:36:20,180
don't have any way to cool the fucking
planet,

2336
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:21,490
so I'm going to change the channel right
now.

2337
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,380
I'm walking away.
But when you talked to dopey republicans

2338
01:36:24,381 --> 01:36:26,570
about all will only tell you something
about these liberals.

2339
01:36:26,571 --> 01:36:29,060
He's liberals in their climate control
now.

2340
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:30,950
they been going on and on about the
climate control.

2341
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:32,060
There's what we know ladies and
gentleman,

2342
01:36:32,061 --> 01:36:34,460
we know that the climate has changed
since the beginning of time.

2343
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,990
It's cyclical.
Okay?

2344
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:39,230
Don't get in the way of big business and
big industry.

2345
01:36:39,231 --> 01:36:41,510
Okay?
Because there's a reason why the United

2346
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:42,231
States of America,
he's doing show.

2347
01:36:42,231 --> 01:36:43,430
Well,
there's a reason why you need this

2348
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:45,300
economy to turn around and it's not
liberal,

2349
01:36:45,301 --> 01:36:48,620
so it's not a god damn sitting around
with tambourines and a circle around a

2350
01:36:48,621 --> 01:36:50,570
campfire singing grateful dead songs.
Okay?

2351
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:51,201
Anyway,
all right,

2352
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:53,120
we'll be right back.
You know what I mean,

2353
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:56,090
and you get into that.
That's read that right wing rhetoric

2354
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,580
idea that you know,
like,

2355
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:59,150
ah,
god got settled down.

2356
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:00,140
Hippies,
you know what it is.

2357
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:02,030
It allows things to happen,
and it also,

2358
01:37:02,031 --> 01:37:05,570
it also stops the debate.
It allows you to stick your dick in

2359
01:37:05,571 --> 01:37:10,040
without a condom because you're silly.
Did the instincts are to fuck things up.

2360
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:13,580
The instincts are to make more people.
The instincts are to continue the

2361
01:37:13,581 --> 01:37:16,220
technological progress regardless of
what fucking effect.

2362
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:19,640
It doesn't matter.
This is human history is one.

2363
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:23,510
The one constant in human history is
that people were never able to see

2364
01:37:23,511 --> 01:37:26,000
catastrophe as a group through world war
one,

2365
01:37:26,001 --> 01:37:28,760
world war ii famines,
the black plague.

2366
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:32,660
It never.
We are not good at predicting major

2367
01:37:32,661 --> 01:37:36,860
fucking issues and events,
whether it's a tsunami all due respect

2368
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:39,010
to the people in Japan or anything like
that.

2369
01:37:39,011 --> 01:37:42,200
We'll eventually not good at doing that.
Well,

2370
01:37:42,201 --> 01:37:44,990
we haven't gotten a lot better.
It used to be and say,

2371
01:37:44,991 --> 01:37:45,950
hey,
by the way,

2372
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,170
there's an.
There's a 20 percent likelihood that a

2373
01:37:48,171 --> 01:37:52,130
huge earthquakes about to hit and the
next week that I'm sure we'll get better

2374
01:37:52,131 --> 01:37:55,470
at doing stuff that we will use to be
that you didn't know a tornado was

2375
01:37:55,471 --> 01:37:57,420
coming until it killed you.
You have no idea.

2376
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:59,670
you had to see it go,
oh shit.

2377
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:00,600
In 2000,
11,

2378
01:38:00,610 --> 01:38:03,180
300 plus people in Alabama and our
country,

2379
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:05,670
there's nothing they can do.
There was nothing they could do about

2380
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,553
that.

2381
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,020
Have you ever seen the the destruction
photos online?

2382
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:12,870
I tweeted them there.
They're insane to tuscaloosa.

2383
01:38:12,871 --> 01:38:17,030
Alabama was literally wiped off them.
I've never experienced in any way a

2384
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:19,950
nature's force like that.
That must be so crazy.

2385
01:38:19,951 --> 01:38:20,820
Terrifying.
Yeah,

2386
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:22,740
and the crazy thing is it happens every
year.

2387
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,410
There was something like 400 fucking
tornadoes this year.

2388
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,190
We were in a house and it gets,
it gets ripped apart and you're in the

2389
01:38:29,191 --> 01:38:30,150
house.
Like,

2390
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:32,250
you know when there's a rainstorm and
you hear thunder,

2391
01:38:32,251 --> 01:38:32,731
you're like,
let's,

2392
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:35,670
let's cut it off in front of the tv.
That's my reality,

2393
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,140
but here's the thing.
I would fucking mood.

2394
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:40,170
Have you ever been in a hurricane?
No,

2395
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:42,510
I've been in a hurricane,
but the hurricanes that hit the east

2396
01:38:42,511 --> 01:38:45,510
coast up in the boston area,
by the time they got up there,

2397
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,100
right?
Not so much.

2398
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:49,770
Not that big a deal when you're in the,
in when you're in the middle,

2399
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:52,200
when it starts,
when you're in the fact that whatever

2400
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:53,580
they call it,
the eye of the storm,

2401
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:54,930
that's not the start.

2402
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,570
The start is the eye is the center.
When you fuck up and you go,

2403
01:38:57,571 --> 01:39:00,350
well,
it's over and you step outside the air

2404
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:06,380
force guys who fly into that shit,
that shit to test all the kinds of nutty

2405
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:10,170
there in the middle of a fucking insane
is that because any other plane comes

2406
01:39:10,171 --> 01:39:11,550
apart,
any other plant comes apart,

2407
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:13,830
they come apart and stuff.
If you're a pilot,

2408
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:17,010
my dad was a pilot for 20 years.
When you're a pilot,

2409
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:21,810
you fuck and worry about thunderstorms.
If there's thunderstorms that is death,

2410
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:24,300
you don't scare a thunderstorm and scary
shit.

2411
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:26,000
Doesn't matter if you're a seven,
47 or less.

2412
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:28,170
guys just fly right into it.
They fly.

2413
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,380
Why don't we make all planes out of the
same shit they make those other plans

2414
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:36,380
because you can only have two or three
passengers and to make it awesome would

2415
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:37,330
be if you were in a plane.

2416
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:40,620
He knew it couldn't break.
this coin is never going to crash.

2417
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:42,720
It flies in a fucking hurricanes and
shit.

2418
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:44,820
It's made out of the black box.
I heard,

2419
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:47,110
I heard the craziest stupid old hack j.
now it's.

2420
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:50,400
I heard that the craziest hippy a theory
lately.

2421
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:53,970
I read somewhere today that if you have
a birthmark that's where you were

2422
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:57,090
murdered in a past life or killed in a
past life.

2423
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:58,620
Is this from a girl that you're trying
to bang?

2424
01:39:58,730 --> 01:40:01,430
No,
I read it on facebook or something.

2425
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:04,350
It's kind of interesting.
I would have been stabbed in the back of

2426
01:40:04,351 --> 01:40:07,110
the head and the interesting.
If you have brain damage people always.

2427
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:12,330
That's why you good experiment.
But what about fucking redheads or

2428
01:40:12,331 --> 01:40:13,190
stabbed everywhere?
No,

2429
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:13,500
no.
I have a.

2430
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:16,320
Gorbachev was shot.
Shot to the body.

2431
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:19,260
When you and I were talking about that
you blew up the internet.

2432
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:21,030
Is that when you can get facts right
away,

2433
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:23,310
like factcheck the thing is like what?
Before that,

2434
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:26,100
you know,
we all just would just start saying shit

2435
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:27,600
like that.
Start saying anything.

2436
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,370
Here's what I know and this is the truth
and being,

2437
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,790
why'd you do some checking?
Like I didn't leave recently.

2438
01:40:32,791 --> 01:40:36,360
I've been going back over my archives of
the shit that I believe and say.

2439
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:37,290
And I'm like,
oh,

2440
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:39,000
that's a big hall there.
Unfortunately.

2441
01:40:39,001 --> 01:40:40,620
The last time you Were here,
there was one.

2442
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:43,530
the ones one about the wiki leaks.
Wiki leaks,

2443
01:40:43,531 --> 01:40:45,480
one will.
You unfortunately said that about that.

2444
01:40:45,481 --> 01:40:46,410
Everybody.
Wikileaks,

2445
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:50,070
apparently they did remove names of all
the people to protect the people.

2446
01:40:50,071 --> 01:40:54,070
Accept people who are no longer with the
cia or whoever were with and you know

2447
01:40:54,071 --> 01:40:56,620
they were already exposed.
Yeah.

2448
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,540
The wiki leaks thing is a very tricky
situation,

2449
01:40:58,541 --> 01:40:58,780
man.

2450
01:40:58,780 --> 01:40:59,131
You know,
they're,

2451
01:40:59,131 --> 01:41:00,730
they're,
they're going after that guy,

2452
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:04,180
his guns blazing because I like
transparency,

2453
01:41:04,181 --> 01:41:06,660
but I don't know.
I don't know,

2454
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:09,790
do know of the 12 we have bp
whistleblowers,

2455
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:12,940
all the 12 people that came forward
about all the problems in the oil

2456
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:14,890
disaster.
Nine of them are missing,

2457
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:19,240
including people murdered people.
One guy who survived and assassination

2458
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:21,570
attempt.
It's really kind of freaked me out a

2459
01:41:21,571 --> 01:41:24,280
heart for bp to that.
That was a hard thing to cover off.

2460
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:27,460
Is it the whole ocean?
Well,

2461
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:31,230
here's a good way to cover it up.
Shoot everybody who knows anything and

2462
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:35,920
it seems like that's actually happening.
I need to this one site that had it,

2463
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:38,590
I put it up on my twitter and it's
getting crushed.

2464
01:41:38,591 --> 01:41:40,460
I can't get to it anymore.
Um,

2465
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:41,710
but uh,
there's,

2466
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:43,220
there's something going on.
I don't,

2467
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:45,160
I don't know if it's true or not.
I need to,

2468
01:41:45,161 --> 01:41:46,750
uh,
I need to find out about this because

2469
01:41:46,751 --> 01:41:49,450
it's pretty fucking fascinating.
The bp exec.

2470
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:50,493
Yeah.

2471
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:53,510
I got confused yesterday.
I was driving down the alley and there

2472
01:41:53,511 --> 01:41:56,950
was these three girls.
It's walking down the alley.

2473
01:41:56,951 --> 01:41:57,731
Like I was like,
come on,

2474
01:41:57,731 --> 01:41:59,530
get the fuck out of the way so I can
drive by.

2475
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:01,690
and they were like 15,
16 year old girls.

2476
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:04,480
All of them just stopped and then
flashed me,

2477
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:05,840
like pull down their own.
They,

2478
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:10,270
they moved me to pull down their pants,
all three of them in burbank and it in

2479
01:42:10,271 --> 01:42:12,830
the back of an ally in the back,
like they were fully.

2480
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:13,720
Yeah,
they were fucking around.

2481
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,640
Like,
I have an alley in my neighborhood.

2482
01:42:15,641 --> 01:42:18,460
There's alleys,
so I'm driving or something.

2483
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:18,820
No,
no,

2484
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:20,800
no.
I'm just driving and I'm just like,

2485
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:22,220
they're,
they're walking in front of me.

2486
01:42:22,221 --> 01:42:23,051
Like I'm like,
come on,

2487
01:42:23,051 --> 01:42:25,060
get the fuck out of here.
And suddenly they just all stopped,

2488
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:27,970
pulled down their pants,
moon me and ran away by the fIrst

2489
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:28,300
second.

2490
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:29,530
I was just like,
oh my god,

2491
01:42:29,531 --> 01:42:32,200
it's a wait.
If there's a broken bitch out there,

2492
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:34,810
brian will find you.
And I did that to brian will find her

2493
01:42:34,811 --> 01:42:38,830
like a magnet to little metal particles
named mark core was named Mark Ward.

2494
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,420
You know joe?
Of course muslim.

2495
01:42:40,421 --> 01:42:42,220
But he was,
he was at my house and he was walking up

2496
01:42:42,221 --> 01:42:43,300
the stairs.
I go,

2497
01:42:43,301 --> 01:42:44,140
come here,
I want to show you something.

2498
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:46,420
Come upstairs.
Because he had just gotten to la to come

2499
01:42:46,421 --> 01:42:49,110
see my one hour and and as he was
walking on stairs unit,

2500
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,290
I was like kind of a state guy and I and
I,

2501
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:55,930
I was bent over with my ass wide apart
and as he walked up the stairs and he

2502
01:42:55,931 --> 01:42:56,440
just goes,
he goes,

2503
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,440
oh,
what's that?

2504
01:42:57,441 --> 01:42:58,330
And he,
I think he went,

2505
01:42:58,331 --> 01:43:00,850
what the fuck?
The same thing you said when you saw

2506
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:01,723
dixon feet.

2507
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:06,520
Listen to out of the 12 people in
question that we're the bp

2508
01:43:06,521 --> 01:43:09,880
whistleblowers nine and mysteriously
dead one nearly died in a brutal

2509
01:43:09,881 --> 01:43:12,790
assassination attempt.
One is imprisoned under questionable

2510
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:15,880
circumstances and another has simply
disappeared.

2511
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:17,461
You don't.
Yeah,

2512
01:43:17,461 --> 01:43:20,050
I don't really believe that either.
And that guy in the questionable

2513
01:43:20,051 --> 01:43:21,910
circumstances where question will tack
brian,

2514
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:24,010
don't talk from the other room.
You fucking freak.

2515
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:26,850
Go piss.
How ridiculous is this guy?

2516
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:29,650
Trinity screaming.
So after that happened,

2517
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:32,380
after that happened,
I was in such shock and I was going to

2518
01:43:32,381 --> 01:43:34,690
starbucks.
I was in such shock and so were in shock

2519
01:43:34,691 --> 01:43:37,360
because some girls moon to you.
I mean that's pretty crazy.

2520
01:43:37,361 --> 01:43:40,990
Seeing three girls butt holes and
vaginas that are under age and you're

2521
01:43:40,991 --> 01:43:43,420
just driving around like minding your
own business.

2522
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:46,410
So I get of my car and I go and see you
actually see they're buttholes and

2523
01:43:46,411 --> 01:43:47,710
vaginas or did they have their legs?

2524
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:48,940
I remember it so that,
you know,

2525
01:43:48,941 --> 01:43:51,280
I remember at least one of them I saw
the like,

2526
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,061
you know,
like the,

2527
01:43:52,061 --> 01:43:54,140
the whatever.
So I,

2528
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:55,750
I,
I'm like thinking about them.

2529
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:57,230
I'm like,
what the fuck was that all about?

2530
01:43:57,231 --> 01:44:00,290
And I walk in and there's alan alda,
is that his name for mash?

2531
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:03,950
Just staring at me like this.
Like he knew that he was just shaking

2532
01:44:03,951 --> 01:44:08,550
his head was so weird
talking about,

2533
01:44:08,590 --> 01:44:10,480
I don't get it.
I walked into starbucks and now now that

2534
01:44:10,481 --> 01:44:12,680
it was and he was staring just staring
at me.

2535
01:44:12,681 --> 01:44:14,000
But it was like,
right when I walked in and was like,

2536
01:44:14,001 --> 01:44:15,350
holy shit,
this is the weirdest.

2537
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:18,860
I was super high when all this
ridiculous conversation or you should

2538
01:44:18,861 --> 01:44:20,870
have started off this conversation by
saying,

2539
01:44:20,871 --> 01:44:22,690
oh hi,
you were because you're like alan,

2540
01:44:22,691 --> 01:44:24,130
all those staring at me.
And he was like,

2541
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:26,990
and that was like really freaking out.
Like what the fuck kind of a

2542
01:44:26,991 --> 01:44:29,750
conversation that we have in here.
What the fuck?

2543
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:32,690
What kind of story is that?
It's what happened to me yesterday.

2544
01:44:32,691 --> 01:44:34,340
We left out the most important part.

2545
01:44:34,930 --> 01:44:36,880
This is one of the reasons why pot
should be illegal.

2546
01:44:36,881 --> 01:44:38,850
NoW I'm on the other side of the fence
where we are,

2547
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:40,540
but here's what I don't believe right
now.

2548
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:43,630
Here's what I don't believe in.
I don't believe in psychics.

2549
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:48,430
I don't believe that corporations like
bp have anything to do with like are

2550
01:44:48,431 --> 01:44:50,720
able to pull off murderers or any of
that state

2551
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:56,760
or murder or based on oil and all wars.
Pretty much how loud?

2552
01:44:56,780 --> 01:45:00,430
It was tough in brisbane.
It wasn't based based on oil necessarily

2553
01:45:00,431 --> 01:45:03,820
alone.
Actual outlet because you left it on all

2554
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,200
week and it's going to blow the fuck up.

2555
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:10,090
Go war made the oil more expensive and a
lot of ways.

2556
01:45:10,091 --> 01:45:12,250
So I don't know why because they're
making more money.

2557
01:45:12,251 --> 01:45:15,500
Those cons you have,
but they're not the ones that nine slash

2558
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:19,600
11.
Is that how things work you?

2559
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:22,210
You say that too,
but how can you say that with any level

2560
01:45:22,211 --> 01:45:23,320
of certainty?
That's ridiculous.

2561
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:25,170
I can say it with a lot of level of
certainty.

2562
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:29,620
The same way I can tell people camper
corporations are working when there's so

2563
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:31,810
many instances of corporations killing
people,

2564
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,910
they all have different.
They all have different agendas is all

2565
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,380
I'm saying like if you're.
If you're a bank,

2566
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:37,900
you have a different agenda and watch a
movie and you're competing against

2567
01:45:37,901 --> 01:45:42,901
another bank and there's a movie where
someone is trying to make money and

2568
01:45:43,181 --> 01:45:46,840
something goes wrong,
and then they hire a hitman and jason

2569
01:45:46,841 --> 01:45:48,430
stage.
Right?

2570
01:45:48,431 --> 01:45:49,390
Based on what?

2571
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:52,000
Based on human fucking nature.
We know it's possible.

2572
01:45:52,001 --> 01:45:55,120
We're not talking about super powers.
We're talking about someone having

2573
01:45:55,121 --> 01:45:57,340
someone killed because it would cost
them billions and billions.

2574
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:00,310
We don't think it's possible boardroom.
You've got to have a problem wIth this

2575
01:46:00,311 --> 01:46:04,150
bp story is it has all the elements of
an internet hoax.

2576
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:05,073
You know?
I mean it's,

2577
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:08,170
it's fantastic.
It's it's unresearched bubble and I'm

2578
01:46:08,171 --> 01:46:11,740
trying to research it and it keeps
telling me that all those investigative

2579
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:14,260
journalists out there from all those
newspapers are always looking for a

2580
01:46:14,261 --> 01:46:15,460
story.
I wouldn't be all over that.

2581
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,080
Believe me,
they would be all over that.

2582
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:18,550
Yeah,
maybe.

2583
01:46:18,551 --> 01:46:21,340
But thIs is.
This is sort of like some kind of shit

2584
01:46:21,341 --> 01:46:22,630
that you have to be really,
really,

2585
01:46:22,631 --> 01:46:23,201
really,
really,

2586
01:46:23,201 --> 01:46:25,030
really sure about the.
You're not going to get this published

2587
01:46:25,031 --> 01:46:27,070
in time magazine.
You lie on your,

2588
01:46:27,071 --> 01:46:32,020
on your podcast to bring a reputable
investigative journalist on this show so

2589
01:46:32,021 --> 01:46:34,480
we can talk about about what a new
hello,

2590
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:36,740
reputable investigative journalists I
want you to do.

2591
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:40,300
This is called the volcano and what's
inside here is marijuana vapor.

2592
01:46:40,301 --> 01:46:43,030
It's way better for your lungs.
Have him come in here.

2593
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,260
Those are.
This is legit,

2594
01:46:44,261 --> 01:46:45,490
bro.
We're ranked on itunes.

2595
01:46:45,491 --> 01:46:46,750
Really?
Number two are,

2596
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:50,240
you know,
it's always number one or number two was

2597
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,100
number five and joe rogan does.
Doesn't surprise me.

2598
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:55,470
Journaling has been a Winner,
my friend.

2599
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,720
And I love you.
I love you too,

2600
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,990
but I think it's a weed.
I'm not that high.

2601
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:05,370
I'm telling you bro,
because I think your thing is too hot.

2602
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:08,820
Really
smoking it too much.

2603
01:47:08,821 --> 01:47:10,830
Sorry.
Yeah,

2604
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,640
you might.
I'm going to kill them.

2605
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:14,850
Volcanoes.
Very tricky.

2606
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:20,220
Some guy just got life in jail for his
third.

2607
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:21,880
We'd,
um,

2608
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:24,200
third.
We'd have never going to be this on

2609
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:25,420
camera and we're going to build one for
fourth.

2610
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,330
Fourth marijuana conviction gets
slidell.

2611
01:47:27,331 --> 01:47:31,710
Louisiana may have life in prison.
He's a repeat offender.

2612
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:34,290
And by this,
a refeed burpee defender,

2613
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:38,010
the jury found defendant guilty of
attempting to possess and distribute

2614
01:47:38,011 --> 01:47:41,370
marijuana.
Dude was selling weed and they put them

2615
01:47:41,371 --> 01:47:43,920
in jail for life,
for life.

2616
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:46,560
And he's 35 years old.
That's ridiculous.

2617
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:47,600
Terrible.
It's a tragedy.

2618
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,090
It's the only way pot kills you.
There's two ways.

2619
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:51,621
Wait,
wait,

2620
01:47:51,621 --> 01:47:53,190
wait.
What was the all four times the same

2621
01:47:53,191 --> 01:47:54,080
thing?
They,

2622
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:55,560
it sounds weird.
All right.

2623
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:59,040
That guy deserves to be in jail.
I'm thinking after the second or third

2624
01:47:59,041 --> 01:47:59,641
time.
All right,

2625
01:47:59,641 --> 01:48:01,210
dude.
Just fucking start funding like in a

2626
01:48:01,211 --> 01:48:03,130
different job for selling weed,
dude.

2627
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:04,370
And you know,
the,

2628
01:48:04,371 --> 01:48:05,820
the,
the law is unjust.

2629
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:08,660
It's unjust.
Retard is.

2630
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:10,590
Yes.
Definitely had the brightest guy in the

2631
01:48:10,591 --> 01:48:11,580
world,
but what he's doing,

2632
01:48:11,581 --> 01:48:14,670
he's not hurting anyone or do we have
too many fucking laws?

2633
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:16,320
You don't feel bad for him because it's
not yo,

2634
01:48:16,321 --> 01:48:16,970
dude.
No,

2635
01:48:16,970 --> 01:48:20,710
it easily could be one strike anything.
I can.

2636
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:23,190
If you have for duis,
I think you deserve to be fucking.

2637
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,670
You're just a fucking retard.
If this guy is selling for duis are

2638
01:48:26,671 --> 01:48:28,140
dangerous,
you're hurting people.

2639
01:48:28,141 --> 01:48:30,450
You're scaring me.
It doesn't matter this brian that

2640
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:31,523
matters.
It matters.

2641
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,420
It matters,
but it also matters like this guy's been

2642
01:48:33,421 --> 01:48:35,340
in trouble three times,
two times.

2643
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:37,620
Okay,
you're right,

2644
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:40,230
but your giving in,
you're giving into the man.

2645
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,480
You're.
You're saying whatever law rules that

2646
01:48:42,481 --> 01:48:44,820
you make is illogical as they are.
I'm going to fall back on because I

2647
01:48:44,821 --> 01:48:48,240
don't want to get locked in a cage.
What I'm saying is there's no way you

2648
01:48:48,241 --> 01:48:49,980
should be locking someone in a cage for
that.

2649
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:52,140
It doesn't make any sense,
and if someone does that,

2650
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:54,750
they're the criminals.
When you have a society,

2651
01:48:54,751 --> 01:48:58,920
a complex society with a massive amount
of access to information and literally

2652
01:48:58,921 --> 01:49:01,320
you can find the answers to any question
instantly on your phone.

2653
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:04,830
When you have a law that's in place
that's completely illogical,

2654
01:49:04,831 --> 01:49:07,980
like marijuana laws and then you
prosecute people for them and then you

2655
01:49:07,981 --> 01:49:10,830
lock them in jail.
You are the criminal.

2656
01:49:10,831 --> 01:49:15,060
You are the one who's going against
logic and nature with all your fucking

2657
01:49:15,061 --> 01:49:19,890
silly studies.
Ron paul just own some motherfucker the

2658
01:49:19,891 --> 01:49:23,160
other day on,
on the senate floor and it was.

2659
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:27,110
The guy Was talking about marijuana.
He said he thought heroin should be

2660
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:29,460
legal.
He ron paul,

2661
01:49:29,461 --> 01:49:32,100
just clown them about personal use,
freedom of use,

2662
01:49:32,101 --> 01:49:35,880
and if heroin was legal,
do you think we'd all be using heroin?

2663
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:37,500
We just.
I mean it was so.

2664
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:39,930
It was so on the money man about all of
it.

2665
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:43,890
We need less fucking laws.
All you people out there that are

2666
01:49:43,891 --> 01:49:47,030
involved in this industry of laws and
industry of,

2667
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:50,170
of creating jobs that,
that are attached to laws.

2668
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:53,680
Your leeches,
your this is leeching off society.

2669
01:49:53,681 --> 01:49:56,290
It's a fucking loophole.
And if we got rid of that loophole and

2670
01:49:56,291 --> 01:50:00,610
forced everybody that has some shitbag
jobs for locking people up for pot,

2671
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:03,820
we would force those people to have more
productive lives because they would have

2672
01:50:03,821 --> 01:50:05,800
to evolve.
I think you would have to contribute.

2673
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:08,650
I think that more than any other time in
our country's history,

2674
01:50:08,651 --> 01:50:09,230
the,
the,

2675
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:12,490
the discussion about legalizing drugs is
very much alive.

2676
01:50:12,491 --> 01:50:17,160
And even polIticians like ron paul who
have a growing following are,

2677
01:50:17,161 --> 01:50:22,161
are being taken very serious,
slowly evolve fast enough drugs not fast

2678
01:50:22,451 --> 01:50:23,920
enough or logic or my taste.

2679
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,080
It's not not changing enough in my
lifetime.

2680
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:27,550
It is changing.
I mean the,

2681
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:31,030
the climate here in California
especially is really revolutionary.

2682
01:50:31,031 --> 01:50:32,830
If you drive down the street near my
house,

2683
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:36,300
there's fucking five.
We'd stores in a one block radius ratio

2684
01:50:36,650 --> 01:50:37,483
area.
It's,

2685
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:40,510
it's really data that is incredible,
but it's not changed enough.

2686
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:45,310
There's still plenty of fucking morons,
silly ideas about forcing people into

2687
01:50:45,311 --> 01:50:48,640
other.
There is a reason why the United States

2688
01:50:48,641 --> 01:50:51,600
is not competing with the rest of the
world as far as things we produce.

2689
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,740
It's because a lot of people aren't
producing shit.

2690
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:56,830
They're just a part of some weird
fucking system,

2691
01:50:56,980 --> 01:51:00,220
some weird system.
It's a very weird system that doesn't

2692
01:51:00,221 --> 01:51:03,250
necessarily make any sense.
Our financial system doesn't necessarily

2693
01:51:03,251 --> 01:51:04,020
make sense.
Our,

2694
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:04,670
our,
our are,

2695
01:51:04,670 --> 01:51:05,321
uh,
we're not,

2696
01:51:05,321 --> 01:51:07,120
we don't really produce anythIng.
You know,

2697
01:51:07,121 --> 01:51:10,330
putin said it best when he was analyzing
United States economy before the crash.

2698
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:12,700
He said,
I don't understand the american economy.

2699
01:51:12,701 --> 01:51:15,280
All they seem to be doing is buying and
selling each other's houses.

2700
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:18,250
And he's right.
What the fuck else do we do anymore?

2701
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:21,730
We make mustangs and camaro's and
corvettes and a couple other things.

2702
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,770
We have a comparison.
Very powerful.

2703
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:25,080
Um,
military.

2704
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:25,451
No,
no,

2705
01:51:25,451 --> 01:51:25,770
no.
I'm,

2706
01:51:25,770 --> 01:51:26,603
I'm,
um,

2707
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:29,290
comPuter industry.
I mean we do that innovation,

2708
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:31,930
art in medical innovation and stuff like
that.

2709
01:51:31,931 --> 01:51:34,480
We got a lot of stuff.
It could be argued though,

2710
01:51:34,481 --> 01:51:37,930
that if there were less laws and they
were more freedom and there was less

2711
01:51:37,931 --> 01:51:41,590
people in these fucking bullshit
parasitic government jobs that those

2712
01:51:41,591 --> 01:51:44,850
people would be forced to contribute.
Maybe they would become cabinet makers.

2713
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:46,450
Huge.
Great argument.

2714
01:51:46,451 --> 01:51:48,380
Maybe they'd become authors.
There would be.

2715
01:51:48,450 --> 01:51:51,790
They would contribute.
It is a form of social welfare to have

2716
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:53,580
shit jobs that aren't necessary.
They.

2717
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:56,530
There was a great article in the wall
street journal about how a lot of

2718
01:51:56,531 --> 01:51:58,720
states,
three out of one job,

2719
01:51:58,721 --> 01:52:01,390
our government jobs,
not not private sector jobs,

2720
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:04,060
manufacturing jobs.
When you hear like the government

2721
01:52:04,061 --> 01:52:07,530
created new jobs and you know what a lot
of those jobs are surveyors,

2722
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:11,710
weird fucking government exemptions that
are unnecessary and build anything

2723
01:52:11,711 --> 01:52:15,730
that's not what made this country great
bureaucrats and you're absolutely right

2724
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:19,030
and it is a form of social welfare
because if you give someone a job and

2725
01:52:19,031 --> 01:52:20,800
make it so they don't have to find their
path.

2726
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:23,080
It's like I've always said that the
greatest thing that ever happened to me

2727
01:52:23,081 --> 01:52:25,420
when I was 21 years old,
I played the lottery once.

2728
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:27,880
I won a free ticket,
but I played it again.

2729
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,950
I want nothing and then I was done.
I said,

2730
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:30,880
I quit.
That's it.

2731
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:34,660
What if I was 21 and broke and scared
and lost and I won the lottery.

2732
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:36,280
That would have been the worst curse
ever.

2733
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:39,670
I would have never found my way in life,
and if you get some shitty fucking easy

2734
01:52:39,671 --> 01:52:42,880
government job you can't get fired from,
and then that becomes your life.

2735
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:44,560
Well guess what?
You're not going to find your place

2736
01:52:44,561 --> 01:52:45,350
either,
man.

2737
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:47,870
You're just going to.
It's a form almost of social welfare.

2738
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:51,090
We need less,
less of everything.

2739
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:53,630
That's where I got like ron.
Paul's on the fucking money,

2740
01:52:53,631 --> 01:52:55,880
man.
That ain't that bad motherfucker.

2741
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:56,751
That guy.
Oh,

2742
01:52:56,751 --> 01:52:58,190
he's the best.
And the other guy,

2743
01:52:58,191 --> 01:53:00,080
Gary Johnson,
the former governor of New Mexico,

2744
01:53:00,081 --> 01:53:02,210
same thing.
She just stand up at a great point.

2745
01:53:02,211 --> 01:53:03,044
He said,
I like him.

2746
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:04,850
He goes,
same sense less jesus,

2747
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:08,090
but I don't mind.
I don't mind ron paul's diseases.

2748
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:10,970
I don't mind any of it because the way
he talks is the way,

2749
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:14,750
which in my mind is America when my mind
is,

2750
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:15,860
here's the deal.

2751
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,920
He believes in personal freedom and
responsibility and allowing people to

2752
01:53:21,111 --> 01:53:25,130
make their own choice.
It makes the call on what is really

2753
01:53:25,131 --> 01:53:28,280
going on and why we're invested in all
these different parts of the world and

2754
01:53:28,281 --> 01:53:30,470
what we're really doing.
He's honest about it and he was saying,

2755
01:53:30,471 --> 01:53:32,570
this is not what America should be all
about,

2756
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:35,660
and he says that all the time.
This is not what this constitution was

2757
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:37,670
supposed to mean.
It's not what our founding fathers

2758
01:53:37,671 --> 01:53:40,160
wanted.
This is the way this is supposed to be.

2759
01:53:40,161 --> 01:53:44,570
The best example possible of what you
can do with this society.

2760
01:53:44,571 --> 01:53:46,610
This is 2011.
We've learned from the greeks.

2761
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:48,740
We learned from the romans,
we learned from the nazis.

2762
01:53:48,741 --> 01:53:50,690
We learned from everybody.
We've got it down,

2763
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:53,180
but we don't.
We don't and we don't and it's

2764
01:53:53,181 --> 01:53:55,610
transparent how we don't.
It's all there.

2765
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:58,550
Every time,
like the obama recently pass on fucking

2766
01:53:58,551 --> 01:54:02,450
new law about genetically modified food
and it's going to fuck over all these

2767
01:54:02,451 --> 01:54:03,380
organic farmers.

2768
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:05,860
Man,
this shit's been going on for awhile.

2769
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:08,450
Monsanto's involved in a lot of fucking
creepy shit,

2770
01:54:08,451 --> 01:54:10,400
man,
and the government has been behind all

2771
01:54:10,401 --> 01:54:12,560
this.
It's a good book though about about that

2772
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:15,390
and we're again,
when you talk about technology and

2773
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:17,990
monsanto and these other companies that
do genetic engineering,

2774
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:21,410
the only way we're going to feed the
growing population is through genetic

2775
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:22,100
injuries.
True.

2776
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:24,620
Now there's a way to do It.
There's a bad way to do it.

2777
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:27,530
Obviously it comes with risks.
It also comes with a great deal of

2778
01:54:27,531 --> 01:54:30,920
promise,
but genetic engineering is in all of

2779
01:54:30,921 --> 01:54:32,960
your future,
whether you like it or not.

2780
01:54:33,190 --> 01:54:37,820
The real problem has toiled to farm
organically and feed all the people in

2781
01:54:37,821 --> 01:54:38,750
africa,
for example,

2782
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,550
etc. Etc.
Right?

2783
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:42,890
But isn't the real.
The real problem is sustainability,

2784
01:54:42,891 --> 01:54:45,710
but the real problem is also that you.
You get to own that.

2785
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:48,710
You own a plant and monsanto is
inherently.

2786
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,090
They're there.
They're trying to,

2787
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:51,760
first of all,
they tried to patent pigs.

2788
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,080
Do you know it's going to be a lot of
that and they're going to figure this

2789
01:54:54,081 --> 01:54:56,030
out in the courts.
But the bottom line is this.

2790
01:54:56,240 --> 01:55:00,440
One thing that none of the promises of
genetic engineering is that we will

2791
01:55:00,441 --> 01:55:04,550
maybe never have to use any pesticides.
And if you want to talk about

2792
01:55:04,551 --> 01:55:06,920
agricultural runoff,
that's one of the biggest forms of

2793
01:55:06,921 --> 01:55:10,370
pollutants and all our waterways.
So for example,

2794
01:55:10,371 --> 01:55:12,860
if you could come up with a kernel of
rice,

2795
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:17,580
an apple that requires no spring because
in it it has genes that are not only

2796
01:55:17,590 --> 01:55:20,000
incredibly nutritious,
but that can ward off any kind of a

2797
01:55:20,001 --> 01:55:22,280
pest.
That's something that is going to be in

2798
01:55:22,281 --> 01:55:24,680
our future.
It doesn't come with risks is are there

2799
01:55:24,681 --> 01:55:25,570
problems are.

2800
01:55:25,570 --> 01:55:27,320
Do you do.
I feel weird about taking the,

2801
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:30,710
the gene of a jellyfish and putting it
into a strawberry because it actually

2802
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,900
keeps it from freezing.
So you can ship it farther.

2803
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:34,340
Yes.
Yes.

2804
01:55:34,490 --> 01:55:36,320
This is where adam corolla would come
in.

2805
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:40,940
What we got here.
It's going to be great in about 10

2806
01:55:40,941 --> 01:55:42,710
years,
right?

2807
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:45,750
You don't want to get in on the ground
floor.

2808
01:55:45,751 --> 01:55:48,870
You don't want to get in here with all
this genetic engineering.

2809
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:52,230
You want to wait?
Let me see if that's what he would do.

2810
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:53,011
Oh,
by the way,

2811
01:55:53,011 --> 01:55:56,520
we told them that.
What you said too about the improV.

2812
01:55:56,580 --> 01:56:00,300
He actually repeated it,
repeated it to us and said that he was

2813
01:56:00,301 --> 01:56:02,850
the happiest he'd ever been.
And you made him so happy.

2814
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:04,380
And I concurred.
I said,

2815
01:56:04,381 --> 01:56:05,400
you know,
I brought it up.

2816
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:06,510
I said,
brian cowen said this,

2817
01:56:06,511 --> 01:56:07,560
and I think he's absolutely right.

2818
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:12,770
He's the best at tying together as long
rants and making them work.

2819
01:56:12,810 --> 01:56:14,220
If I,
if I listened to him,

2820
01:56:14,221 --> 01:56:17,820
I can get him.
I could start doing my act and he's got

2821
01:56:17,821 --> 01:56:18,800
it.
He's got a uh,

2822
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:19,890
you know,
one of those things.

2823
01:56:19,891 --> 01:56:20,990
I think it was that.
Yeah,

2824
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:23,610
he's that smart.
It kind of norm macdonald's and he's an

2825
01:56:23,611 --> 01:56:24,540
interesting guy,
man.

2826
01:56:24,541 --> 01:56:25,630
I really,
I really liked him.

2827
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,040
Smart guy.
He's very smart.

2828
01:56:27,041 --> 01:56:29,490
He's very smart and in a very unique and
interesting way.

2829
01:56:29,530 --> 01:56:31,200
My buddy box,
very honest.

2830
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:33,000
He's got heavy hands.
He says,

2831
01:56:33,001 --> 01:56:33,781
I really.
Yeah,

2832
01:56:33,781 --> 01:56:35,760
he's a good boxer.
See the movie the hammer?

2833
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,070
No,
it's all about him being a boxer.

2834
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:40,740
Well,
I know he's in the ring and he's,

2835
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:43,260
he's apparently,
he was a boxing trainer for a long time

2836
01:56:43,261 --> 01:56:44,760
too.
That's how I made a living in hollywood.

2837
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:46,260
Yeah,
he's a good dude,

2838
01:56:46,261 --> 01:56:46,380
man.

2839
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:50,490
I really liked that guy was a very
unusual thinker and a,

2840
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:52,960
and an unabashed gearhead.
I love that too.

2841
01:56:53,970 --> 01:56:55,050
I loved cars,
man.

2842
01:56:55,070 --> 01:56:58,400
I hate when people pretend like I've run
on some guy's thing,

2843
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:03,510
shitting on someone for being middle
aged and buying a sports car that it was

2844
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:06,750
such a midlife crisis sort of thing,
and I was like,

2845
01:57:06,751 --> 01:57:08,340
god,
what a silly way to look at that.

2846
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,370
How come he's not?
how come he's not just an enjoying the

2847
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:14,550
fun of anybody who's a gearhead because
it's a passion.

2848
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:17,310
It doesn't have to be in anything
rational and logical about it.

2849
01:57:17,311 --> 01:57:19,620
It's a passion.
So some people are born with the

2850
01:57:19,621 --> 01:57:24,090
wrenching gene at the random forest of
the wrenching jane.

2851
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:26,670
Jane and I don't like it.
I'd rather have somebody else to do.

2852
01:57:26,671 --> 01:57:28,410
I'm.
I have the driving gene,

2853
01:57:28,411 --> 01:57:30,870
but I Want someone who knows what the
fuck they're doing to fix my shit.

2854
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,350
You have to drive.
You always loved.

2855
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:34,530
I love cars.
I'm well.

2856
01:57:34,531 --> 01:57:36,810
I'm first of all,
I'm a technology fanatic.

2857
01:57:36,811 --> 01:57:39,900
I'm obsessed with it.
I've always been obsessed with any new

2858
01:57:39,901 --> 01:57:42,570
gadget.
I remember the first time I saw pong I

2859
01:57:42,571 --> 01:57:44,430
was.
I was obsessed with it.

2860
01:57:44,431 --> 01:57:46,950
I couldn't believe that soMeone had
figured out a way to make this move.

2861
01:57:46,951 --> 01:57:51,060
Something on the tv was one of the first
people I ever met who had email and

2862
01:57:51,061 --> 01:57:52,410
stuff like I was like,
oh yeah,

2863
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:55,500
what's his email thing that I had a
computer in [inaudible] 94 and I didn't

2864
01:57:55,501 --> 01:57:59,180
send an email to anybody until like 98.
Nobody had fucking email though.

2865
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:01,950
I never got it now.
I hardly ever talked to any of my friend

2866
01:58:01,970 --> 01:58:04,650
Amy Patton oswald and I've been going
back and forth on twitter.

2867
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:06,180
I'm supposed to call them,
but I'm like,

2868
01:58:06,181 --> 01:58:10,740
can I actually have to call somebody and
make her go back and forth to talk about

2869
01:58:10,741 --> 01:58:14,800
a funny dude I love his writing was one
of my favorite guys as far as like

2870
01:58:15,090 --> 01:58:18,810
taking a premise and this beaten the
shit out of it and he's going into all

2871
01:58:18,811 --> 01:58:20,040
sorts of weird ways with it.

2872
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:21,810
He's.
He's a really interesting guy.

2873
01:58:21,811 --> 01:58:23,820
I liked him.
He was a writer on mad tv when I.

2874
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:26,520
When I first started this,
it really was a part of the original

2875
01:58:26,521 --> 01:58:29,310
cast.
He was there and I enjoy his cds.

2876
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:33,720
I think he's my favorite guy to listen
to you and have sketch ideas on the wall

2877
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:38,580
and one was one was just explosive
diarrhea and then the other was feeling

2878
01:58:38,581 --> 01:58:39,540
kind of rapey.

2879
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:42,850
We were,
uh,

2880
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:45,790
when we were doing mad,
the man show that was one of the most

2881
01:58:45,791 --> 01:58:50,770
fun things is to put a pump a bunch of
ideas and try to make some duty that I

2882
01:58:50,771 --> 01:58:52,060
do that with my writing.
Do you do that?

2883
01:58:52,061 --> 01:58:54,320
see I have a board up there.
I do that with my,

2884
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:58,450
my act now and I take a photo of it on
my iphone and then when I'm in a hotel

2885
01:58:58,451 --> 01:59:01,540
room and I want to go over my notes,
I just look at the photo and you could

2886
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:04,420
get expanded.
so I move it around and iT's easier than

2887
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:07,360
turning pages.
It's technology man.

2888
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:09,410
It's making it all easier.
But uh,

2889
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:12,960
I think writing something down and like
putting it up there for you.

2890
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:16,420
There's something about creating when
you write things down and then put it

2891
01:59:16,421 --> 01:59:19,570
into like a little box and then stick
the box in the wall and step back and

2892
01:59:19,571 --> 01:59:22,630
look at it as like,
instead of like being on top of it,

2893
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:25,740
writing it and being immersed in the
words to sit,

2894
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:28,190
put it on the wall and step back.
Really,

2895
01:59:28,290 --> 01:59:31,020
really successful.
Screenplay writer I've ever spoken to

2896
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:34,250
does exactly that.
They really sIt down and write real,

2897
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:38,700
real wow from Alan Ball who I talked to,
who wrote american beauty,

2898
01:59:38,701 --> 01:59:42,930
who I talked to about how he starts his
scripts and stuff and he said character,

2899
01:59:42,931 --> 01:59:44,820
but you know,
but any of those guys,

2900
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,380
all of them,
todd phillips,

2901
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:49,650
they,
they outlined the shit out of it.

2902
01:59:49,651 --> 01:59:51,240
They see it up on a board and I don't
know,

2903
01:59:51,241 --> 01:59:54,860
one director or one right.
Or certainly not one screenplay writer.

2904
01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:57,050
Not one who makes it fortune.
Uh,

2905
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:58,710
who,
who was a successful screenplay writer,

2906
01:59:58,711 --> 02:00:01,620
a professional who doesn't do that.
I just started doing it recently.

2907
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:03,990
I've been writing forever.
It's the way to do it.

2908
02:00:03,991 --> 02:00:06,390
That's why a lot of people write a
screenplay and then they just end up

2909
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,730
running out of steam or it doesn't quite
work.

2910
02:00:09,450 --> 02:00:13,640
There's a.
there's a real sort of structure and

2911
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:15,750
technique to writing.
You see,

2912
02:00:15,751 --> 02:00:18,330
even novelists,
novelist will lay it out,

2913
02:00:18,331 --> 02:00:20,670
man.
I mean john irving for his last book,

2914
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:23,310
took seven years to write that book.
Seven,

2915
02:00:23,311 --> 02:00:26,970
think about the act of faith that would
require because it had to be thematic.

2916
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:29,040
He created these characters,
very autobiography,

2917
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:34,350
a book a year in the mystic river,
a one year in the scripture,

2918
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:36,650
I believe it's called.
What is it about a.

2919
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:39,460
It's very autobiographical about silicon
goc.

2920
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:40,980
No,
john irving is that.

2921
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:41,873
Not everything is.

2922
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:45,720
It took them seven years and it's always
about blown dudes by the river.

2923
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:49,920
Black cod
turns this in.

2924
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,860
This is.
Have you read.

2925
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:53,190
Have you read any of his books?
No.

2926
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:54,910
No dude,
I can't believe you haven't read genre.

2927
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:55,711
You know what,
dude?

2928
02:00:55,711 --> 02:00:57,600
I kind of stopped reading fiction a long
time ago.

2929
02:00:57,601 --> 02:00:59,340
I started reading some Joe Hill
recently.

2930
02:00:59,390 --> 02:01:00,610
I stopped leaving.
Kingsborough.

2931
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:01,710
Yeah.
I started.

2932
02:01:01,710 --> 02:01:04,710
I started reading it again because it's
fun and I realized I was reading too

2933
02:01:04,711 --> 02:01:06,720
much creepy shit.
It was almost like what I was talking.

2934
02:01:06,721 --> 02:01:10,680
I'm going to writing a whole bit about
it in my act now about the apocalypse is

2935
02:01:10,681 --> 02:01:11,514
not,
you know,

2936
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:12,930
it's here,
but it's not here.

2937
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,670
You know what I mean?
like what I said earlier,

2938
02:01:14,671 --> 02:01:16,290
the way I phrase it,
it was the first time I ever phrased it

2939
02:01:16,291 --> 02:01:17,310
that way,
that it's here in the sunnier,

2940
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:21,330
but I'm writing this whole,
this whole big chunk about that and so

2941
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,470
it's forcing me.

2942
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:26,250
I'm constantly reading all this nutty
fucking shit about the world and I'm

2943
02:01:26,251 --> 02:01:26,971
like,
god damn it.

2944
02:01:26,971 --> 02:01:28,790
This is not that fun.
Like you can.

2945
02:01:28,791 --> 02:01:32,020
You can freak out about fucking
supermassive black holes and super

2946
02:01:32,021 --> 02:01:35,760
volcanoes and you could freak out about
the shifting of the polar ice caps and

2947
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,250
it really doesn't make life any more
interesting.

2948
02:01:38,430 --> 02:01:41,300
But if good werewolf movie comes out,
you know,

2949
02:01:41,301 --> 02:01:43,430
life is fun for like a fucking hour and
a half.

2950
02:01:43,431 --> 02:01:45,020
You know what I'm saying?
if you pick up a good.

2951
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:46,940
Joe hill is stephen king's son and he's
a.

2952
02:01:46,970 --> 02:01:49,080
He's a writer as well.
Yeah,

2953
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:50,360
he's a good dude.
He's good.

2954
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:51,570
I got it.
I read just.

2955
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:54,200
I'm almost done with heart shaped box.
Great.

2956
02:01:54,201 --> 02:01:57,320
fucking scary shit.
It's about a guy who was a rock and roll

2957
02:01:57,321 --> 02:02:00,290
star,
like some creepy marilyn manson who buys

2958
02:02:00,291 --> 02:02:04,640
this a dead guy's suit online because
it's haunted.

2959
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:07,130
It comes with a ghost and he thinks he's
being accused,

2960
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:10,550
so he buys this dead guy suit.
I don't want to say any more about the

2961
02:02:10,551 --> 02:02:13,400
plot because the plot is brilliant,
like how it's all established and set

2962
02:02:13,401 --> 02:02:16,430
up,
but it's a fucking page turner and it's

2963
02:02:16,431 --> 02:02:19,370
so much more fun than comedy and michael
rupert book about the collapse of

2964
02:02:19,371 --> 02:02:20,960
civilization.
You know,

2965
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:24,380
smoking cigarettes,
collapsed documentary.

2966
02:02:24,381 --> 02:02:25,870
have you ever watched you want to shit
your pants.

2967
02:02:25,871 --> 02:02:28,040
Watch that collapsed documentary.
What is that?

2968
02:02:28,330 --> 02:02:29,630
it's michael rupert.
He's this guy,

2969
02:02:29,631 --> 02:02:33,680
used to be a former la cop who busted
the cia selling drugs in la

2970
02:02:33,681 --> 02:02:36,740
neighborhoods and went public with it
and eventually left the police force and

2971
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:39,620
was told that he was supposed to let
these people go and it caught them and

2972
02:02:39,621 --> 02:02:40,280
he's,
you know,

2973
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:41,720
very,
very vocal about it.

2974
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:43,160
Always worried he's going to get
assassinated.

2975
02:02:43,161 --> 02:02:45,650
Well,
thAt started as downward spiral of doubt

2976
02:02:45,651 --> 02:02:49,430
and doom and now this guy is.
He's got a whole fucking documentary

2977
02:02:49,431 --> 02:02:51,230
where he was sitting there smoking
cigarettes,

2978
02:02:51,410 --> 02:02:54,110
talking about how the society we're
going to run out of oil and society is

2979
02:02:54,111 --> 02:02:54,310
going to.
