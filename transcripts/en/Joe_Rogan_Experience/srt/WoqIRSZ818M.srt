1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,340
Really California.
I don't even know where Eureka,

2
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:04,980
California.
It's about 200 miles north of San

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,940
Francisco.
Oh,

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,290
in the middle of weed country.
The whole,

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,260
the whole state's wheat country now.
But I'm going to look at a weed deal.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,580
Can I just tell you that you are
impeccably dressed in a very unique and

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,200
original way.
Thank you.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,740
I mean your dress really well,
but I've never seen a guy dressed as

9
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:27,180
well as you with such unusual colors and
the tie and the shirt and my wife

10
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:28,170
dresses me.
Does she?

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,910
Yeah.
Just try and keep you from getting laid.

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,990
That's what it is.
Well Sally,

13
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:36,210
can you figure that she's making you
just look real flamboyant where people

14
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,350
just don't know what to think.
Yeah,

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,200
I liked the whole thing.
The scarf you got in the pocket.

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,831
Yeah.
This,

17
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,130
this is how I dress though.
Can you pull this out right up to,

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,540
sorry.

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,780
These things are very directional.
Um,

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,670
if you don't know how I dress all the
time.

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,570
Yeah,
I got it.

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,660
Well,
I mean at the house I a boxer shorts and

23
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,850
a tee shirt,
does it?

24
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,230
Yeah.
In the house.

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,580
And then outside,
outside,

26
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:59,490
and I'm normally dressed as us or in my
uniform.

27
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,150
My three piece suit.
Yesterday I gave a talk in beverly hills

28
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:05,070
to some kids and I was in my three piece
suit.

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,630
What did you ever talk about?
Uh,

30
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:10,410
one of my mentees is a guy named Jason
capital who is the,

31
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,070
he doesn't say it this way,
but he is the preeminent expert in how

32
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:19,071
to get laid a and he's got ninth,
quite as many followers as you do,

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,800
but a million or a million and a half.
Really?

34
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,380
And it's just teaching people how to get
laid.

35
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:24,661
No,
no,

36
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:26,610
no.
He doesn't build self esteem.

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,630
Oh,
but I mean,

38
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:29,970
but at the end of the day,
all these little weenies went to get

39
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,804
laid.

40
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,870
So he teaches them how to not be a
little weenie anymore.

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,490
Correct.
Correct.

42
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:38,970
Man up or something.
And so he asked me if I'd talked to his,

43
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,890
he's got different programs,
you know,

44
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:42,330
the game they sell up,
sell up,

45
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,090
sell up.
So was premier group I talked to

46
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,670
yesterday,
said it's about 60 70 guys who obviously

47
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,980
must pay the most money to a monthly.
Yeah,

48
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,010
but he's got 40,000 people that pam,
between 80 bucks and 3000 a month.

49
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,550
What?
Yeah.

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,520
That's insane.
Fucking right.

51
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:00,090
I know.
And he's just teaching them how to be a

52
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:02,660
man.
Be a man.

53
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,900
How did I,
how did he,

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,360
um,
his dad beat the fuck out.

55
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,560
I'm just like,
my dad beat me.

56
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,270
Oh Wow.
That's what we need more.

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,400
And Jason capital's not as,
not not his name.

58
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,710
He's got a,
a,

59
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,040
a,
a Polish name.

60
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,560
He's from Detroit,
but that's a big secret,

61
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:16,980
that name.

62
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,470
But,
but he's Jason capital and he's good

63
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,730
looking.
He's a really good looking guy.

64
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,850
Well that helps if you want to get laid.
Yeah.

65
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,810
But then if you want to teach people how
to get laid,

66
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,600
that helps.
You can't really teach that though.

67
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,340
Like you can't teach being a good
looking guy.

68
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,203
Yeah.
Well no,

69
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,410
but I,
I told the kids,

70
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:33,300
um,
when I was their age,

71
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,530
I got,
and I was single and pre-aids I got more

72
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:39,360
ass than a toilet seat at the bus
station.

73
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,280
That's a lot.
Yeah.

74
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,790
But I did.
And last night I had dinner with a buddy

75
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,570
of mine who unfortunately,
he's the guy,

76
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:51,480
the agent orange now,
he's got orange here on marine here from

77
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,450
Vietnam.
And he was one of the guys that I used

78
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:56,250
to run around with.
And uh,

79
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:58,470
I brought back some of the memories in
his daughter's going,

80
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,010
you mean you were a slut

81
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,330
dad?
Whoa.

82
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
And uh,
and she talks about that in front of the

83
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:04,390
young lady.
And then I was,

84
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,500
sorry,
I brought up the subject.

85
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,570
Yeah,
you can't do that for certain Giles'

86
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,860
especially today.
Yeah,

87
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,840
man.
Horns not appreciated anymore.

88
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,130
No,
no,

89
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,720
no.
So this guy's a,

90
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,660
I can't believe people are paying $3,000
a month.

91
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,920
What could it possibly be giving them
for $3,000 a month?

92
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,280
Well,
content of some sort.

93
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,370
I've never looked at it,
so I can't really tell you content.

94
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,290
I mean,
content is the name of the game.

95
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,910
Jamie,
I need a mug buddy.

96
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,280
Sorry.
Content is the name of the game,

97
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,170
but it's 3000.
It seems like you'd have to come to your

98
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,470
house and give you back rubs.
I mean that's a lot of that getting

99
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,131
money,
man.

100
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:37,720
That's like a mortgage.
That's crazy.

101
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,540
$3,000 a month now.
The 80 a month.

102
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,900
I can,
I can understand why don't even,

103
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,360
that's a lot like what has he given you?
Netflix is nine bucks.

104
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,470
Can Watch documentaries to your ears,
bleed,

105
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,141
you know?
Yeah.

106
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,090
I've only turned my Netflix on a couple
of times.

107
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,370
The uh,
it's,

108
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,630
it's,
it's interesting,

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,710
but yeah,
so I was there,

110
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,330
gave a talk at,
ran over.

111
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,260
I talked to an a half hours and then I
went out to the,

112
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,450
to Valencia to see my buddy did the
marine guy for dinner and uh,

113
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,570
the uh,
took three and a half hours to get to

114
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:09,430
Valencia from Beverly Hills.
Yeah.

115
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:11,890
It's a ridiculous piece of traffic we
have out here.

116
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,140
Yeah.
So set of a scene of traffic.

117
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:15,430
It's pretty,
it's,

118
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:18,490
it's way worse than it was when I first
moved here in 94.

119
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,340
And I got a wonder what it's going to be
like 20 years from now.

120
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,150
It's going to be insane.

121
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,210
It's going to be,
well then hopefully they'll have hover

122
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:27,160
cars that knock each other.
Well,

123
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:30,760
we were talking about that yesterday.
We watched some clips from blade runner,

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,680
the movie that was supposed to be 2019,
like that's the only supposed to be two

125
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,780
years from now.
And that crazy didn't realize that

126
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,210
Harrison Ford.
Yeah.

127
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,770
Yeah.
Daryl Hannah,

128
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,410
um,
rutger hauer great movie.

129
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,290
Yeah.
One of my favorite all time Scifi

130
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,110
movies.
But yeah,

131
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,290
hard to believe that that was supposed
to be just a couple of years from now.

132
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,820
Like people really overestimated the
amount of technology we'd have by then.

133
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,841
Well,
I mean,

134
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,670
uh,
they overestimated that,

135
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,290
but in some,
some things they underestimated the

136
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:00,940
internet.
Yeah,

137
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,870
correct.
I mean,

138
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,040
when I first said 30 years ago,
the two things to get involved in,

139
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,040
we're healthcare and telecommunications
with morphed into the Internet.

140
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,890
I had no idea what the Internet was
going to be.

141
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,150
Uh,
you know,

142
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,570
people measure rotates,
returns on their investment and return

143
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:20,950
on the minute,
not returned on the hour or the month or

144
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,190
return on capital because things can
change,

145
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,720
you know,
in a few seconds.

146
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,610
But how do you feel about that?
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

147
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,610
but how do you feel about that of a guy
that's been an investor for as long as

148
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:31,860
you've been?
What do you,

149
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,710
how do you feel about this new thing
where they're using computers and

150
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:40,470
algorithms to buy and trade?
Like literally at the speed of sound and

151
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:40,921
just click,
click,

152
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:43,930
click going back and forth depending on
the trends and they,

153
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,150
they're,
they're paying money to get a server

154
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,660
that's as close as possible to the
exchange so that they're living and they

155
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:53,620
were literally buying and selling in the
milliseconds or a millionth of a second

156
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:55,720
ahead of everybody else because they're
closer to the exchange.

157
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,980
I came up the old way.

158
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
I don't really,
uh,

159
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,560
I appreciate the,
the progress,

160
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,530
but I don't like it because I,
most people don't understand it.

161
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,610
And like I was tweeting this morning,
a gold's down,

162
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,110
uh,
oil broke a $48 a barrel or $49 a barrel

163
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,180
and a how was your 401k improved?
What are your gurus telling you to do

164
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:18,650
now?
The market's up.

165
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,990
Uh,
depending how you want to measure 20,

166
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:24,740
25%.
Since trump got elected on the 8th of

167
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,480
November,
and hardly anybody has benefited the

168
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:29,300
guys that had benefited of the guys who
drive the indices a,

169
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:33,770
he's created 3 billion,
$3 trillion if she's me in market cap on

170
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:35,570
the,
on the just the New York Stock Exchange.

171
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,580
Uh,
but most people haven't benefited

172
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:41,180
because 70 to 90%,
depending on how you want to count a or

173
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:44,210
calculate a of that money is a big
money,

174
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,430
rockefeller,
Pena,

175
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,440
trump,
et cetera.

176
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,370
And so the average guy,
the average joe didn't benefit.

177
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,550
You know,
I ask anybody listening,

178
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,960
check your 401k or your pension plan,
tell me how much it's up since November

179
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,820
8th most people say nothing.
Nothing.

180
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,080
So I'm a part of that is just what you
were alluding to the algorithms,

181
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,870
because it's the f fast,
big money that's making all the big

182
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,790
money.
Although a hedge funds have fallen out

183
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,850
of favor the last couple of years
because their returns haven't been the

184
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,560
same as even the indices.

185
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,270
So your feeling,
how do you feel about the things that

186
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,610
trump is doing right now and the way
he's,

187
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:22,480
uh,
you know,

188
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:24,730
he's,
he's bringing on all these guys that

189
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,370
have worked for these major corporations
like Exxon and he's,

190
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,970
they're doing that,
the whole thing that he announced the

191
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,120
other day of creating 45,000 jobs and
they'll go in the golf coast.

192
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,580
And like,
if you look at it,

193
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,200
um,
there was a thing on the New York Times

194
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,880
today,
I think that was talking about,

195
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:42,160
maybe it was time magazine.
It was talking about he's created

196
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:46,720
239,000 jobs since he's been in office,
which is,

197
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:47,471
uh,
what does it,

198
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:49,060
a couple of months,
not that long.

199
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,540
And so are you from a business
standpoint,

200
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,010
forget about like socially.
Well,

201
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:54,900
let flint business sandpoint claimer
first.

202
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,150
I know trump.
Okay.

203
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,090
And I knew them from that late eighties
in the,

204
00:07:58,091 --> 00:07:59,410
um,
in the early nineties,

205
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:02,470
because one of my partners,
and one of my mentors was governor Hugh

206
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,580
Carey,
the former governor in New York.

207
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,510
So because of his New York relationship
and also one of my,

208
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,370
uh,
ex business partners with Mayor Wagner,

209
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:10,510
the former mayor of New York.

210
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,570
So I knew trump then.
So,

211
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:14,790
but I haven't,
I haven't talked to him in over 20

212
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,710
years.
But getting back to your original

213
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,120
question,
um,

214
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,103
the,
um,

215
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,560
I believe that as,
um,

216
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,350
there's a reason why he's meeting with
all the ceos of all these major

217
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,080
industries because nobody else has ever
done it.

218
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,640
Uh,
I believe in,

219
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:32,030
as I endorsed him,
I was one of the early endorser's flip

220
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,300
trump and I said that,
um,

221
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,940
if he's serious
and he'll win,

222
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,580
he knows how to win.
He doesn't know how to lose.

223
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,190
If he's serious,
he's going to rock the fucking planet,

224
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,380
not just the u s but the world.
And the financial models are changing in

225
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:50,940
Europe.
Uh,

226
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,580
not just because of brexit.
The financial models are trainging,

227
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,810
uh,
in Russia,

228
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,520
the models are changing in,
in,

229
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:01,521
in China because they've got a guy,
I got an Alpha male in the office that

230
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,420
has surrounded himself with Alpha males.

231
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,170
It's no coincidence at 60% of his staff
are ex military.

232
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,630
I mean,
the press secretary is that God damn

233
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,640
Lieutenant Commander in the Navy,
uh,

234
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,420
you know,
uh,

235
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,520
not counting all the four star generals
that he's got.

236
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,880
Um,
so I don't agree with everything he

237
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:20,190
says.
I don't agree with everything he tweets.

238
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,010
I wouldn't tweet as many,
as much as he does,

239
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,250
but I do agree that the country needed
to change financial change and he's

240
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:28,710
going to bring it now whether he gets
elected a second term or not,

241
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,930
I don't know.
But I do believe,

242
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:33,900
and I've said Joe,
that this is the November the eighth was

243
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,320
the beginning of the greatest
transformation of wealth the planet has

244
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,900
ever fucking seen since World War II.
How so?

245
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,400
Because well,
I mean,

246
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:44,550
just look at $3 trillion so far in stock
market.

247
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,470
I believe it's going to be $100
trillion.

248
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,060
He's going to add to the market before
he's going to his office.

249
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,610
He's explained to a dummy like me dummy.
Okay.

250
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,583
Oh cool.
Okay.

251
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,130
A Caterpillar,
even though they got in some trouble for

252
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:57,810
taxes,
they got raided a,

253
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:59,580
here are a couple of days ago.
You mean not a seller?

254
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:01,420
What are the caterpillar,
they make tractors.

255
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,290
Okay.
The infrastructure shot in this country.

256
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,400
Okay.
Uh,

257
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,810
the bridges are all 40,
50,

258
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,880
60 years past their prime.
Okay.

259
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,250
I didn't know a bridge could go past its
prime.

260
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,350
Uh,
the roads are 50,

261
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:14,970
60,
70 years past their prime.

262
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,820
Uh,
the infrastructure for pipelines are

263
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:21,090
past their prime,
so he's going to rebuild all this.

264
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:24,960
He's gonna spend supposedly a $3
trillion,

265
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,570
uh,
which is not a coincidence that because

266
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:30,960
he added 3 trillion to the stock market,
but he's going to add infrastructure.

267
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:32,890
So all the stocks like Caterpillar,
a,

268
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:33,750
t,
and t,

269
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,823
uh,
Boeing,

270
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,410
etc.

271
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,230
Uh,
I've gone up 15,

272
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:37,921
20,
25,

273
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:40,620
30% since he got elected because the big
money,

274
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:42,240
the smart money,
uh,

275
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,180
knows that those companies are going to
get all the contracts.

276
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,640
The,
the real no brainer is aerospace,

277
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,680
aerospace,
not just because he cut the cost of a

278
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,910
air force one down 700 million or
whatever he did,

279
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,680
but because he's going to bring the
United States military back to what it

280
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:01,410
was under Reagan 30 years ago.
Um,

281
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,080
and being a vet myself,
uh,

282
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:05,580
I believe a strong country.
Uh,

283
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,680
I think we get involved in too much shit
outside of the country.

284
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,080
Okay.
But I mean a strong country then

285
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:10,970
nobody's going to,
you know,

286
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,380
screw with us.
He's going to bring back jobs.

287
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,720
Uh,
I believe he will build a wall.

288
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,040
And My mother and grandmother's swam
across the Rio Grande River as illegal

289
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,560
aliens in 1924.
25.

290
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,371
My,
my,

291
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:24,930
my mother,
God rest her soul.

292
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,850
We were just out at the cemetery a
couple of days ago.

293
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,290
Um,
the,

294
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,300
uh,
it wasn't a naturalized citizen until

295
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:32,130
she was in early thirties.
So,

296
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:33,150
um,
the,

297
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,250
um,
but I figured out a way to pay for the

298
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:37,430
wall.
And Yours is the first show I'm going to

299
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,640
say it on.
Okay.

300
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,310
Okay.
They arrested Guzman,

301
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,340
the great drug trafficker from,
okay.

302
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,480
They also confiscated $39 billion from
did it really?

303
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,420
He had heard the 9 billion.
Whoa.

304
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,230
Okay.
39.

305
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:54,380
It's Hashtag podcast,

306
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,330
I mean,
yeah.

307
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,253
Okay,
good.

308
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,360
So why not pay for the wall with his
money?

309
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,920
Yeah,
that's probably a good idea.

310
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,000
But do you think that a wall is a
feasible and it's a good idea to have

311
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,010
this?
I know it's feasible,

312
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:06,844
but I don't.
Um,

313
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,250
but I'm a,
I'm a guide that I would rather pull the

314
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:13,180
trigger and see if it works then not do
anything.

315
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,330
The biggest difference between most of
the kids that are out there trying to be

316
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:19,810
successful like yourself and some of the
other people you've interviewed here is

317
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:21,790
they spreadsheet at the death.
They read books,

318
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,010
they listen to podcast and they never do
a fucking thing.

319
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,960
Okay.
I've had kids come to my seminar that

320
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:31,570
ever read 700 books on personal
development.

321
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,020
I didn't know there was 700 bucks in
personal development.

322
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,180
Okay.
But they've never pulled the trigger

323
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,040
paralysis by analysis.

324
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,970
Yes sir.
Yeah.

325
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:41,310
That can definitely happen.
Yeah.

326
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:42,340
It can definitely happen.
And,

327
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:43,220
and the,
uh,

328
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,360
like the kids yesterday,
they'd all read books and I don't even

329
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:48,080
know what the charm books are.
I,

330
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,290
I have no idea.
There's actually a program called the

331
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,660
art of charm,
which is the same thing,

332
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:54,610
how to get laid.
That's not what they call it,

333
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:56,500
but it's,
there's a deal is exactly what it is.

334
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:59,200
Right.
I've looked at it and I've actually been

335
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:00,640
interviewed on the,
on the kid show.

336
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,710
That seems to me like saying something
like,

337
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,530
uh,
how to get famous instead of like just

338
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:08,740
get really good at something and you're
famous like how to get laid well,

339
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:11,350
just be a,
an excellent person and people want to

340
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,340
fuck it.
Yeah,

341
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,390
that's what I think.
Yeah.

342
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,410
Well I mean,
uh,

343
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,990
I,
I proved that for a lot of years.

344
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,293
Yeah.
I do ask,

345
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,900
but I mean a pre pre aids pre-aids yeah.

346
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,080
It's when you slow it down.
Well,

347
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,490
no,
I got married on a notch.

348
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,100
I got married,
I got married.

349
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,090
Yeah.
Everybody was scared.

350
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:29,830
People don't know.
Today kids aren't scared of AIDS

351
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:32,500
anymore,
but back in the 80s when Magic Johnson

352
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,810
got aids,
I will never forget where I was in my

353
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:37,240
car when he got HIV.
Rather when they announced it on the

354
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,470
radio,
I was driving in my car.

355
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:39,304
I was like,
oh my God.

356
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,770
It was like a scene in a Zombie movie
where you thought this was the

357
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,510
beginning,
this was the first one,

358
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,210
and then eventually was going to spread
across the entire country and everyone

359
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:47,270
you knew it was gonna play.
Yeah,

360
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,610
we were really worried.
Yeah,

361
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,740
we were really worried.
We you single then.

362
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,040
Oh yeah,
yeah,

363
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,880
yeah.
Well I think I was 20 where you stand up

364
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,080
comic then.
Yeah,

365
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,550
just who's 21 I think.

366
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,300
Cause I know my research,
um,

367
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
they went of the things I saw was when,
I don't know if you were a teenager when

368
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:09,280
you were in a competition and you
knocked the guy cold in the first 10

369
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,730
seconds or two minutes or one minute.
It's on,

370
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,150
it's on the Internet competition you
were in,

371
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,760
I think he was still a teenager maybe.
I don't know.

372
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:16,780
Probably,
yeah.

373
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,390
Taekwondo tournament up had a lot of
that stuff.

374
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,580
And um,
the,

375
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,930
um,
but I mean,

376
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:24,940
you practice a lot to get good.
Oh yeah.

377
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,770
Yeah.
You have to.

378
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,210
If this doesn't happen,
well you don't.

379
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,860
Yeah.
You have to actually do it too.

380
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,180
It's exactly what you're talking about.
Yeah.

381
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,100
You could read theory all you want,
but until you got theories,

382
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,620
one thing and thoughts were another
thing.

383
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:39,310
But actions are critical.
You have to think about what happened

384
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,410
during the actions and be prepared to
fail.

385
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,950
Dalai Lama at his 80th birthday,
which I was not invited to and maybe you

386
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,893
want to find it.
No,

387
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,420
no,
no.

388
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,880
The Dolly,
he made a little speech and at the end

389
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:51,650
of the speech he's got a sentence.
Meditation is Great,

390
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,040
prayer is great.
A couple of other things are great,

391
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,040
but the best thing is taking action.
Action.

392
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,480
Action.
Okay.

393
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,280
And uh,
the,

394
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,480
um,
and so,

395
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:03,770
and this is what I,
uh,

396
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,180
I teach and,
uh,

397
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,570
the is to take action in a,
I've done a lot.

398
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,190
I have had a lot,
a lot of success,

399
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,220
but I've had a lot of failures,
but nobody's interested in my failures.

400
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:15,170
They're only interested in the,
you know,

401
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,360
the Times I've got it across the goal
line.

402
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,720
Well,
Thomson girl is a huge fan of yours and

403
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:22,880
that's how I found out about,
he thinks you're hilarious.

404
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,650
You're ruthless approach to coaching
people and advice.

405
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,903
It was pretty fun.

406
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,610
Yeah,
I mean when I had lunch with him a few

407
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,510
days ago,
uh,

408
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,260
I think I told you on the phone and I
was expecting he and his wife to be

409
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,230
keeping me rolling in the aisles and
they were straight.

410
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:40,270
They were like three trust and they
were,

411
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,040
yeah,
they were like,

412
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,020
preachers look at it.
It looks like picture man

413
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,010
ai.
He does.

414
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,820
He looks like he easily could be some
sort of a pastor was beautiful tie.

415
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,650
Look how slim me as to now.
Tom Seger kept the weight off.

416
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:51,570
Amazing.
Great.

417
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,980
He's lost like 60 pounds or something
crazy like that.

418
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:54,814
Yeah,
yeah,

419
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,160
yeah.
They had a competition with his friend

420
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,920
Bert Kreischer and they did it over two
days on the show.

421
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:01,780
Like they weighed in twice in a row.
And Tom,

422
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,330
Tom one the way in both days.
Yeah.

423
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,310
It was a big deal.
It was a big deal for him to,

424
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,650
I really think he lost more than 50
pounds,

425
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,513
which is pretty impressive.

426
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,380
Well,
a few years ago,

427
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:16,030
a 10 12 years ago,
I just decided at 60 and I was going to

428
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:19,450
become a power lifter.
I don't know what possessed me.

429
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,710
So I gained 65 pounds.
I took human growth hormones,

430
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:26,530
they did the whole nine yards and I got
up to two 80,

431
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,740
Jesus Christ.
And um,

432
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,040
and then,
uh,

433
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,100
I was trying to get the up to 300,
but I couldn't get up to 300 pounds

434
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,990
weight.
I tried like hell.

435
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,630
I mean I eat everything.
I eat everything on this table,

436
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,583
metal,
light and care.

437
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,570
Uh,
and then I realized that and then,

438
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:42,760
uh,
I also don't have the,

439
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,161
uh,
the,

440
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,310
the right bone structure.
And so,

441
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,920
um,
I decided that the,

442
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,670
there's certain things I can only do so
much weight.

443
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,740
So I was doing bench presses with my
son.

444
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,010
Uh,
at that time he was a 28 and a,

445
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,630
we were doing sets and,
um,

446
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,860
I heard this rip in my bicep and I kept
working out.

447
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,500
But what I had done is I ripped my long
head bicep.

448
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,450
And so,
um,

449
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,400
the,
but one of the reasons they call me the

450
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,620
bionic man,
because I just had two knee full knee

451
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:10,570
replacements in the last couple of
months.

452
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,740
I've got an artificial hip.
I have artificial shoulders.

453
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,140
Oh,
I have a titanium collarbone.

454
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,020
Oh.
And I don't have any long head bicep.

455
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,520
And so,
uh,

456
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:24,550
these are all,
what's a long head bicep muscles,

457
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,010
right.
It's the one that makes the Hump Right.

458
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,360
You don't have that one across the top?
No,

459
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:31,600
I don't have that one.
So yours just goes flat when you uh,

460
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,180
yeah,
but now my musters go flat anyway cause

461
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:37,210
I don't work out like I used to.
But you could have got that repaired.

462
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:38,690
He chose one.
I know I got to repair it.

463
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,720
Not once as they say in Texas is not
once,

464
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,040
not twice but three times.
And I fucked him up all three times.

465
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,450
How'd you pick it up?
He kept lifting.

466
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,030
Yup.
[inaudible] maniac to

467
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,140
powerlifting.
How long has to,

468
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:54,540
or how quick was too early?
Um,

469
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,070
two months.
Oh Jesus.

470
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

471
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,160
You can't do that.
I like,

472
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,050
and my knees,
they told me I had the second knee done.

473
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,610
Yeah,
I weighed at 10 weeks.

474
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,830
But they were right and I was wrong.
Yeah,

475
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:05,790
I would imagine there would be.
Right.

476
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,590
And you would be wrong.
I,

477
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,730
yeah.
So now when I get up from here,

478
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:12,510
you'll see how I get up gingerly.
So Wa like when they build you an

479
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:13,860
artificial knee,
it does,

480
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,720
it does.
It did they chop off the top of your

481
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,940
knee?
Screwed in place at the top and the

482
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:21,690
bottom femur.
And then they put like a joint like this

483
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:26,370
and then it has these like spikes that
go into the bone marrow and they cement

484
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,360
them.
No Jews.

485
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,760
They didn't tell you tell me.
It's,

486
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:31,410
see your knee goes like this moves both
ways,

487
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,790
but my knees only go this way.

488
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,250
Goes up and down.
So I had to relearn how to put my socks

489
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:40,251
on because when you put your socks on,
your leg swings over.

490
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,860
You can't swing your legs.
No,

491
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,590
no.
So there's a little sideways movement.

492
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:45,480
Correct.
Jesus Christ.

493
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:47,340
That seems like it would be severely
limiting,

494
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:47,911
right?
Yeah.

495
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:48,810
Well it is.
Well I,

496
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:52,470
the uh,
I don't think I'll be when in martial

497
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:54,340
arts you say we're going to roll and
then I,

498
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,590
you won't be,
it won't be rolling.

499
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,860
Now did you,
did you have ligament damage or meniscus

500
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,500
damage?
I had three surgeries on my right knee

501
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,210
for the,
all of the above.

502
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:06,510
And I had one surgery on my left knee.
Why they decided to replace the entire

503
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:10,890
name cause I had no cartilage left.
I was bone on bone from running tens of

504
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,430
thousands of miles.
I,

505
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,760
when I went to,
um,

506
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,840
a biohack a couple of years ago,
I didn't even know what that meant.

507
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,250
Biohacking and I went to the bio hacking
and all the guys and I met a guy I

508
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:23,670
really liked to seen it.
Was there a guy named to Siena and uh,

509
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,563
the,
uh,

510
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,910
uh,
all these things I've been doing since

511
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:30,990
the 70s,
I ran a hundred miles and piss blood,

512
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,140
which used to be the benchmark.
If you are a man and a runner,

513
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,180
you run a hundred miles and you piss
blood.

514
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,770
Okay.
That's makes you man.

515
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,790
Yeah.
Because yeah,

516
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,510
that's what that,
that's that then it did.

517
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,970
And I've done,
can you breathe?

518
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,610
Yeah,
yeah,

519
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,220
exactly.
And I,

520
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,530
you know,
I've run marathons and I run a lot,

521
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:49,500
a lot of miles and uh,
my knees paid for it,

522
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,390
so I haven't really been able to run in
20 years.

523
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,790
Have you ever looked at a stem cell
therapy for it?

524
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:54,901
Yes,
I have.

525
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:58,620
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to Mexico and a couple of

526
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:58,920
months.

527
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,340
I tried it 25 years ago when it first
came out in Switzerland.

528
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,380
They're doing it here.
No,

529
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,100
I won't have to go to Mexico.
No,

530
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,280
I didn't know they were doing.
Yeah.

531
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:06,631
Yeah.
I'll,

532
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:09,360
I'll talk to you after the show.
There's a great place in Vegas,

533
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,070
you know that they're a,
they're doing it,

534
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:13,020
but they've been able to regenerate
meniscus,

535
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:14,670
tissue,
cartilage,

536
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,620
all sorts of things like that.
It's a,

537
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,870
it's a slow process,
but it can be done now.

538
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,990
Okay.
But when it seems like yours is gone

539
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,060
now,
can you like play tennis?

540
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:25,930
Can you move around?
Can you go side to side?

541
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,750
I can go this way.
I strive to move this way.

542
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,040
Oh Wow.
I can't move out.

543
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,990
You couldn't tell why you're walking?
No,

544
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,481
no,
no.

545
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,250
I'll walk away.
It's,

546
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,083
you know,
um,

547
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,780
as Fernando Lamas,
still great actress said many years.

548
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:38,340
What's better?
Fernando Lamas.

549
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,460
He says it's better to look good.
Feel good.

550
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,980
Well he's,
I don't know if he's right.

551
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,740
He was married to Esther Williams.
I think he's wrong.

552
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,040
I think he's definitely wrong.
I think

553
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,650
you're better off feeling good and
looking good because if you look good

554
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:52,300
and you feel like Shit,
you live in hell.

555
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,700
But if you look like shit,
but you feel fantastic,

556
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,350
as long as no one's looking at you and
you know,

557
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:57,790
freaking out,
what do you care,

558
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,923
right?
Yeah,

559
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,940
I think he's wrong.
So,

560
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:03,040
um,
your knee and your hips,

561
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,340
like what wwe did the hip do,
they saw the top of your hip off to do

562
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:07,230
the same.
Same thing.

563
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,540
Oh Jesus.
So you've got to the top of your femur

564
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,370
and the bottom of your femur saw dogs.

565
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,173
Jesus.
Dan,

566
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:21,270
you kill a bear with a knife.
I slowed it down with a handgun and then

567
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:25,770
I killed it with a knife.
The knife was what was going on in the,

568
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:28,330
um,
well let me just say I have three

569
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:30,050
regrets in life.
Um,

570
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,800
it leads into this,
the segway,

571
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:34,510
it will become obvious.
First regret is a,

572
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,130
uh,
the,

573
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,880
the day before my mom died,
I told him,

574
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:38,620
you're not fucking sick.
You're not fucking sick or you're not

575
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:40,030
going to die.
She dies the next day.

576
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,630
Okay.
Second regret I have is the fact that,

577
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,030
uh,
I'm a combat trained army officer who

578
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:48,310
never saw combat.
Okay.

579
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,590
Never gotten any real trigger time.
Okay.

580
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,020
Uh,
the third regret is that I didn't set my

581
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,200
goals high enough is successful as I am.
Okay.

582
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,410
So because,
uh,

583
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,400
I,
I tried to get involved with mercenary

584
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:01,240
things.
Uh,

585
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,010
uh,
when I got out of the military about 10

586
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:06,490
years,
cause I had done very well as far as

587
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,420
business was concerned.

588
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,310
And um,
the,

589
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:11,450
um,
but the,

590
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,450
I actually did a joint venture with the
CIA.

591
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:16,060
It's all public record now.
And the I statue of limitations passed

592
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:17,860
so I can't get in any trouble.
And uh,

593
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:20,410
that didn't work out.
So I decided to go do big game hunting.

594
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,970
And see if I can,
you know,

595
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,680
so I started with the rifles.
I know some guys do beaus I believe you

596
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:30,650
do a then I that was too easy.
Then I did a hand gun,

597
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,740
hand gun handgun,
four or five,

598
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:35,560
four console used to be the biggest
handgun made 25,

599
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:37,020
30 years ago.
So I hunted handgun.

600
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,610
And you gotta get pretty close handgun.
How close you get.

601
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,390
Um,
well I've been as close as you to what?

602
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,640
To the charging buffalo.
Oh,

603
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:48,470
Jesus Christ.
A buffalo was charging to disclose.

604
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,750
And you shot him with a handgun?
Yeah,

605
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:50,590
I got run over by him.

606
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,110
Oh,
well.

607
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,860
So like,
let's get back to the bed,

608
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,310
but the handgun,
like do you try and get inside of 20

609
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:58,510
yards?
Like how close the chat?

610
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,980
Well,
it depends how good a shot you are.

611
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,910
Right.
But I mean,

612
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:03,250
they're effective at 50 yards,
but,

613
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,020
uh,
the accuracy is not so good,

614
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,480
but 20 yards is pretty good.
20 meters.

615
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,860
So,
um,

616
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,783
the,
um,

617
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,470
so we're chasing this bear down right on
the borderline of Alaska and whatever

618
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,630
the Canadian provinces up there.
And,

619
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,740
um,
the,

620
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:19,060
I get within about 50,
40,

621
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:20,920
50 yards of him.
And,

622
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,480
uh,
then he turns around because he says,

623
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:23,450
why am I running?
You know,

624
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,910
the asked him said,
why am I running?

625
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,940
And he turns around and I hit him a
couple times with the four or five,

626
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:30,700
four and now I know.
So then he runs again.

627
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,130
And so I chased him some more and make a
long story short.

628
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,220
By the time I unloaded all five,
cause they don't need five shells.

629
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,381
He's,
he's,

630
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:39,610
he's wounded.
He would have died probably in an hour

631
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,220
or two hours,
but he's still dangerous.

632
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,600
So then I jumped on him and,
uh,

633
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,580
stabbed 70,
80 times.

634
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,420
Jesus Christ,
Dan 70 or 80 times,

635
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,040
I don't remember because the
adrenaline's pumping.

636
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,840
So it was so hard.
The,

637
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,990
the Hunter Guide said my arm looked like
a,

638
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:58,280
um,
a jackhammer.

639
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,200
It was going up and down so fast,
but I mean,

640
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:00,951
I'm just,
you know,

641
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:02,570
I'm dumb,
just jacked up.

642
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,690
And where he stabbed him,
I stabbed him in the chest,

643
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,150
around the head,
the neck in here.

644
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,450
I was trying to hit a main artery and
he's,

645
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,160
he trying to bite you on the big claws,
you know,

646
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,160
but I'm staying under the closet and
he's losing coordination.

647
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,540
He could've gotten me,
but he didn't.

648
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,790
He didn't.
Jesus Christ.

649
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,350
Well,
get up,

650
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,390
which is a brown bear or a black bear
brown.

651
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,920
But the better story is the Buffalo.
Now you,

652
00:24:26,921 --> 00:24:29,090
Suzie,
how do you get a better story than you?

653
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,100
Maniacally homocide.
Nickel homicidally homicidally stabbing

654
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:36,090
a brown bear to death.
I don't know.

655
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,250
I went to the La Australia there.
You saw the movie Crocodile Dundee?

656
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,320
Yes,
I do.

657
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,820
Okay,
well there's a real crocodile dundee.

658
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:45,440
His name was barry leaves.
So I went down there to hunt with him in

659
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,230
Australia for 10 days and,
uh,

660
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,650
again with a handgun.
And um,

661
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,620
he said,
I said,

662
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,330
I want to take,
I want to get a big bowl,

663
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,820
a big bowl,
a water buffalo.

664
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,870
Yeah,
exactly.

665
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,010
And he said,
okay,

666
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:01,310
well we have to go into a certain part
of Australia up near Darwin,

667
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,680
up north.
And he said that,

668
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:05,300
um,
I can't promise you still going to be

669
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,250
there,
but there's a big pond about four or

670
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:10,970
five times as big as this room and he
should be there in the late afternoon

671
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,330
scratching his back on the roots
overhanging.

672
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,950
And so we got,
got there and we hiked in four or five

673
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:19,070
hours and he was there just like he said
he was going to be there and he said

674
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:19,904
that,
um,

675
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,881
uh,
you went,

676
00:25:20,881 --> 00:25:21,291
um,
you know,

677
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,450
not just don't want to just shoot them
in the bag.

678
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:24,170
No,
I want,

679
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,730
I want him charging me.
So he says,

680
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:26,564
okay,
I want to say women.

681
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,360
You wanted him to charge you?
Yeah.

682
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,770
Why did you want that?
I never saw combat,

683
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,710
but why?
Why is that so important to you?

684
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,800
Like what is alleged is,
so just in your mind,

685
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,140
you needed to be not fulfilled.
Wow.

686
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,210
Life and death.
Yep.

687
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,860
It had to be like life and death combat.
Correct.

688
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:46,010
Wasn't with the enemy.
It was with some charging beats.

689
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,120
Correct.
Wow.

690
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,950
Okay.
So he throws pebbles.

691
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:51,020
Adam,
he spins around and he says he won't

692
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,330
come out this way because it's too far
for him to jump.

693
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,190
And he's not,
he can't jump that high.

694
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,000
Just like magic,
that Goddamn ball jump 15 feet in the

695
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:04,001
fucking air spun around and right at me.
So about where you are as he ran over me

696
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:08,030
and I fell back,
I shot once and I hit him through the

697
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:09,400
chin.
We're not as knows,

698
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,940
but it missed his brain.
He put one hook on my hip and that's why

699
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:17,600
I had to get a hip eventually and one
hook on my left knee.

700
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,460
So arguably that's why I have a left
knee.

701
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,640
So I felt like I had trained hit me.
So he keeps running.

702
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:24,350
I get up,
I'm dusted myself off.

703
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:28,430
So I've shot one out of five bullets,
so I see why I got it.

704
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:31,340
I'm going to kill this bastard.
So I'm chasing him in the jungle with a

705
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,080
blown out knee and a blown out hip.

706
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,270
Correct.
I'm chasing them in the jungle.

707
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,560
And the,
um,

708
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,290
the guide barry leaves is yellen.
Dan,

709
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,120
I can't hear them though,
cause I'm all pumped up.

710
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,440
Hey Dan.
Dan,

711
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,880
he's screaming at me so I get close to
him.

712
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:47,940
I shoot a couple of times more times
than I should have a couple more times,

713
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:51,900
and then the ball gets tired.
He spins around just like in the movies

714
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,680
and decided to charge from about that
wall and just as he got about to where

715
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,990
that chair is,
I fired again.

716
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,490
Click,
I'm empty.

717
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:07,140
Oh No.
And he falls down at my feet from the

718
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:10,020
other times I hit him,
Jesus Christ and so,

719
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:11,820
but with Barry leaves was yelling at me.
He says,

720
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,640
you're a fucking empty.
You're fucking empty.

721
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,530
He was telling me I had no more bullets
left.

722
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,180
What?
I couldn't hear that.

723
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,040
Now when you get in,
in,

724
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,260
in,
in a contest,

725
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:25,380
martial arts does.
Do you go into automatic?

726
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

727
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:30,930
You have to think very little while
you're in there.

728
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,760
You're supposed to be,
I mean there you have,

729
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,460
when you separate a little bit,
you sometimes you have time to think

730
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:38,070
about what you're going to do,
but most of it is you're relying on your

731
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:39,270
training and your conditioning.

732
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,910
Well I hear you when you are announcing
a those the fields,

733
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,960
uh,
about,

734
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,430
uh,
there's seven guys that are really in

735
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,230
good condition that,
you know,

736
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:50,140
the animals are beasts and uh,
the,

737
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,650
it seems to me that that's one of the
telling things.

738
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:55,900
If you run out of gas in the second,
third and fourth round,

739
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:56,690
you're screwed.

740
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,220
Yeah.
Well there's different styles of

741
00:27:58,221 --> 00:27:59,780
fighting too.
There's some guys who just,

742
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,410
they sprint and they can blow you out in
the first couple of rounds,

743
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,600
but if they get into the third,
fourth and fifth round,

744
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,240
they significantly diminished their
output.

745
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,660
And that's,
uh,

746
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,900
some,
some guys have strategies like to

747
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:13,760
weather the storm,
you just have to figure out a way to

748
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,820
whether a certain fight or storms and
then take them into the second and third

749
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:17,654
round.
I like,

750
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,730
there's a guy like Hector Lombard is a
famous,

751
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,490
a MMA fighter.
He was a champion and other

752
00:28:22,491 --> 00:28:23,870
organizations,
he's just a scary,

753
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:26,630
scary guy.
And for one round he might be the

754
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:28,970
scariest motherfucker and the division,
he's terrifying.

755
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:32,510
He's built like a brick shit house.
He comes at you fast and hard,

756
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,370
but he's so muscular and so strong and
his output is so explosive and kinetic.

757
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,680
He's not like a rhythmic,
slow,

758
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,080
technical,
methodical fighter.

759
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:44,930
He's a sprinter.
And so after that initial sprint,

760
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,550
it's,
he's not the same in the second and

761
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:49,550
third rounds usually cause he win.
Sometimes he wins a lot.

762
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,080
I mean,
he's a world class fighter for sure.

763
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,000
The guys I liked with the Diaz brothers.
Oh yeah.

764
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:53,930
Well Duh.
They're appropriate.

765
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,240
They're the opposite.
They're guys who just,

766
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:59,270
they just come at you and they can throw
volume for days.

767
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,290
They don't ever get tired.
Those guys can go on and on and on and

768
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:02,810
on.
Not,

769
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,190
they break people with their pace.

770
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,121
Yeah.
And,

771
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:06,570
and the,
when he beat,

772
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,440
uh,
the older one,

773
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,670
I guess beat Mcgregor.

774
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,950
No,
the younger one gets nate.

775
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,300
Nate is the younger one.
Yeah,

776
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,570
yeah,
yeah.

777
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,930
Yeah.
That was a great fight.

778
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,050
It was a fun fight.
Second fight was fun too.

779
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

780
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,700
So you,
so from not having combat experience in

781
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:25,040
the war,
you had like this desire,

782
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,980
real combat experience.
You had this desire to put yourself in

783
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:29,480
danger and a test yourself?
Yeah,

784
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:31,070
I wanted to see if I was going to live
or die.

785
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,540
So that's why you decided the next way
to do this is to do it with a,

786
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,050
a water buffalo new,
you were talking earlier about mercenary

787
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:39,884
work.
Like what kind of,

788
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,723
what kind of mercenary?

789
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,490
In the early eighties,

790
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,540
I had the privilege of being mentored by
constantine sauce,

791
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,250
who was the chief executive of Onassis
shipping line,

792
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,190
the 60 year right hand man of Aristotle
Onassis.

793
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,120
He was one of my mentors.
And um,

794
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,260
the,
um,

795
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,640
he,
the Vatican,

796
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:02,200
the CIA,
a melded Marcos and a guy named

797
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,240
Talavera.
So mobile oil to CEO,

798
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,160
uh,
came up with an idea that they were

799
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:08,710
going to invade Haiti just like Clinton
did 12 years later.

800
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,780
Okay.
And um,

801
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,380
for all different reasons on acid is one
of the shipping of the oil,

802
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,360
a mobile,
one of the oil,

803
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,760
uh,
the Vatican one and more Catholics.

804
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,990
CIA wanted to have them not be a baby
doctor.

805
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,950
Volume communistic even with the
communist right at the,

806
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:28,750
at the near Florida.
And I don't know what the fuck I'm elder

807
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,890
was there for,
but you know,

808
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,050
she wasn't buying shoes or anything,
but she was there.

809
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,341
And,
uh,

810
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,020
I was put in charge of that project,
uh,

811
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,630
by,
uh,

812
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,990
Mr [inaudible] and,
uh,

813
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,840
the,
and we put together a mercenary army and

814
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:44,380
we had some of the great mercenaries,
a guy named Mike Williams,

815
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,230
one of the great mercenaries of the
seventies and eighties.

816
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,630
And just as we were going to launch the
attack in land with boots on the ground,

817
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,550
uh,
Cyrus Vance,

818
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,290
secretary of state pulled the plug on
the deal,

819
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,690
but I was going to come out of a
helicopter just like shorts nacre judge,

820
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:02,740
by the way,
you can't hold us.

821
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,510
Big Guns aren't,
you can't,

822
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,760
the way they do it at the too heavy.
But anyway,

823
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,320
I was going to be the first foot feet on
the ground and then when that thing fell

824
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:12,131
to shit,
I said,

825
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,900
well,
maybe I'm just not meant to see combat,

826
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,490
you know?
Wow.

827
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:18,250
So it was something that was really
important to you.

828
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,720
Was it important to you because you
didn't know how you would fare or

829
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:26,020
because you knew how you would fare and
you wanted to test yourself or you just

830
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:28,060
wanted to,
I was 100% positive.

831
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:32,170
I knew that I had balls and I wouldn't,
you know,

832
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:34,510
Wienie out.
But until you do it,

833
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,200
you don't know for sure.
Growing up as a kid and on the hood and

834
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:38,950
he'd been arrested five times and all
the trouble.

835
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:40,870
I got him up in the hood.
Yeah.

836
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,210
What Hood?
He still a did you really?

837
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,830
Yeah,
that's hilarious.

838
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,090
In fact,
we were just over there.

839
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:49,900
I like to go to the hood to three times
a year just to see it again.

840
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,380
And so I went from the Jonathan Club
where I'm a member to the hood and uh,

841
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,710
the,
uh,

842
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,300
is my same driver.
I've had many years.

843
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,970
And uh,
we took one of my mentees who's also

844
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:05,971
from the hood Cambodian kid because the
Cambodians drove the Mexicans out of my

845
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:07,690
portion of the hood.

846
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,350
And so I went to back to the hood and he
went to the same grammar school.

847
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:12,310
I did,
wrote a street.

848
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,530
He went to the same Catholic church I
went to.

849
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,630
Now for your audience,
nobody believes this.

850
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:19,510
But I used to teach catechism.
I used to teach Bible study because I

851
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:21,820
wanted to be a priest.
You wanted to be a priest when I was a

852
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:22,930
little kid.
Whoa.

853
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,460
Yeah.
And so,

854
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:25,360
uh,
the,

855
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,860
uh,
it's hard to believe,

856
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,770
but I did,
but maybe all little Catholic boys when

857
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:30,521
they're 10,
12,

858
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:32,530
13 wanted to be priest.
Maybe not.

859
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,880
But I did.
So,

860
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,990
uh,
when,

861
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:38,290
um,
when I got in a lot of trouble when I

862
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,890
was in the fifth,
sixth grade,

863
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,510
I dropped an aquarium and it's on my
side.

864
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,000
I,
it's pointed a picture from the second

865
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:47,120
floor.
I dropped an aquarium on my teacher's

866
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:49,040
head from the second floor.

867
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,790
And if he hadn't moved six inches,
we wouldn't be sitting here.

868
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,910
I would have gone to San Quentin.
I would have gone to Juvi Bubba,

869
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:57,740
Bubba,
and I would've had a different life.

870
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,630
So he was then,
I only broke his own,

871
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:02,320
shattered his shoulder.
Oh fuck him up as Christ and I,

872
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,370
that's not the worst thing I did in
school.

873
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:07,640
I was expelled three times before I got
out of grammar school.

874
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,650
But yeah,
grammar school,

875
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,000
Grammar School.
What'd you do?

876
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,040
Well,
I did that to the teacher.

877
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,040
They expelled you for how long?
Uh,

878
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,410
three weeks.
And then you come back then another guy?

879
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,720
No,
I didn't say sorry.

880
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,070
Uh,
another guy,

881
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:24,920
another guy in the school.
Did you feel sorry?

882
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,450
No,
I don't,

883
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:27,800
I didn't try to kill,
I really didn't.

884
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,750
That wasn't in my mind old.
Were you at the time?

885
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:31,070
I was 11.
12.

886
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,370
So why were you doing that?

887
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,830
He pissed me off,
obviously.

888
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:36,320
I don't really remember why.
I know I dropped the guy damn aquarium

889
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:37,850
though.
That's a given.

890
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,920
So another guy I got in a fight with a
guy in and knocked him down and uh,

891
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,780
I was the biggest guy in grammar school.
I wasn't,

892
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,550
you know,
I remember that you were the biggest guy

893
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:50,570
in grammar school.
I was a Thomas Thomas to grammar school.

894
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,990
And uh,
so some other guy came up and I got in a

895
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:58,310
fight knocking him down and apparently
he broke his elbow when he fell down and

896
00:33:58,311 --> 00:33:59,390
the kid says,
you broke my arm.

897
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:00,920
He broke my arm.
And then I did.

898
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,280
I went over and I,
I broke his arm and six places for real

899
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,220
after that.
Now you've got to meet her arm and so

900
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,590
fucking kid.
Yeah,

901
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,740
I guess it was.
So do you think that this was from

902
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:15,380
growing up in the hood,
just being in the wild dog eat dog

903
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:16,100
environment?

904
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,870
Yeah,
I'm positive.

905
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,840
It was.
Yeah.

906
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,610
And so that led you to really want to
test yourself in the military.

907
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:26,120
Correct.
And when you look back on all that stuff

908
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:28,640
and all that intense aggression and all
those thoughts,

909
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,550
how did you,
did you take anything out of that that

910
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:34,010
you carry with you as an older man?
Absolutely.

911
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,781
Uh,
well,

912
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,930
I'm a kinder,
gentler,

913
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,910
real nice guy.
I am.

914
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,761
Uh,
but I,

915
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:40,470
I've,
I've turned that aggression into a

916
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:44,660
success in business.
What about peace and calm?

917
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,670
Do you have that?
I don't meditate.

918
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,600
I don't do any of that stuff.
Um,

919
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,030
but do you feel good?
Do you feel like I feel like twisted

920
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:55,130
steel and panther ipis well,
I mean twisted steel and Panther Piss is

921
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:57,740
an odd combination of field.
Well that's a Texas oil field.

922
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,360
Uh,
yeah.

923
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,780
And I just visited a,
one of my buddies from the war who's

924
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:05,120
unfortunately got a agent orange.
Yeah.

925
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:07,910
You were telling me that like,
so what are the effects of agent?

926
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:09,050
However,
as you get older,

927
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:13,040
your immune system breaks down and the
Agent Orange that you had latent in your

928
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,590
system now starts to come out.
Like what does it,

929
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,131
how does it,
well,

930
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:17,450
I mean,
he's lost 40 pounds.

931
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:21,620
This guy,
I saw him pick up a core bet when we

932
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:26,090
were kids and now he has trouble getting
up steps.

933
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,490
So Agent Orange is some scary shit,
wasn't it?

934
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,570
Yeah.
Could,

935
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,900
it was an exfoliant,
right?

936
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,050
Or correctly it defoliant that they
sprayed on the jungle in Vietnam War.

937
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,100
All these soldiers who are down

938
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,900
there in it,
crazy,

939
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,540
crazy shit that they just experimented
on those kids.

940
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,190
Yeah.
And that's just,

941
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:44,971
you know,
again,

942
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:46,380
folks,
don't forget,

943
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,640
that was 50 years ago.
It wasn't that long ago at all.

944
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,130
We,
I mean every,

945
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:53,310
everything,
it's like I sat next to Mcnamara when he

946
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:57,990
was president of the World Bank who was
one of the fathers of the Vietnam War.

947
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,340
And,
uh,

948
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,780
he was a weird dude.
I mean,

949
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:01,950
uh,
uh,

950
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,701
and uh,
he,

951
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:05,280
uh,
he said that the world is going to end

952
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,540
in the,
uh,

953
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,680
La Apocalypse and it's going to be the
haves against the have nots someday.

954
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,310
He says,
hopefully you'll won't be around when

955
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:15,870
that happens.
Uh,

956
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:16,770
and,
um,

957
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,560
the,
uh,

958
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,830
he says there's certain problems on the
plant that are never going to get

959
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:22,870
solved.
And he talked about the Israeli middle

960
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,030
and he says,
yeah,

961
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,110
he says,
um,

962
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,790
they,
we have had,

963
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,620
um,
at that time too,

964
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:30,550
holy wars.
Uh,

965
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,540
and you could argue this is just an
extension of the holy war,

966
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,070
what's happening?
And he says,

967
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:41,270
we didn't work it out 700 and 780 and we
didn't work it out in an 1,118 and we're

968
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:42,990
not going to work it out this time.

969
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,140
And so he was kind of,
um,

970
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,300
a negative guy.
Class was half empty instead of half

971
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:49,380
full.
What do you think?

972
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,540
I don't think we're going to work it out
there either.

973
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,550
No,
I've been in partnership with the

974
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:56,040
Israeli government and I've been in
partnership with the Kuwaiti government,

975
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,930
the Yemen government and a couple others
there.

976
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,273
And,
um,

977
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,740
it's just a,
it's a bridge too far.

978
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,500
I just don't see it happening.
I just don't know.

979
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:06,600
Why is that?
Uh,

980
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,340
well,
I mean for the,

981
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:09,810
from the Muslim point of view,
uh,

982
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,150
and they have the right to practice
whatever religion they want,

983
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,760
but it's an eight,
ninth century religion in the 21st

984
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,080
century.
I mean,

985
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:18,630
there's a lot of stuff that's not
socially acceptable.

986
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,720
You talk about politically correct a lot
of the stuff they do,

987
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,260
it transcends being politically correct.
I mean,

988
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,110
um,
and I don't think that's going to

989
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,953
change.
I just don't,

990
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,760
uh,
I hope I'm wrong.

991
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,200
So you think that the way they,
like for instance,

992
00:37:35,201 --> 00:37:37,990
where they treat women the way they
won't let women drive,

993
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:40,950
the way they make them worthy,
they're religious.

994
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,813
How do you say,
okay,

995
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,610
yeah,
yeah,

996
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,510
the burgers.
Yeah.

997
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,460
Well,
so you think that that's just going to

998
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:48,130
stay the way it is forever.
In my lifetime.

999
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:49,420
In your lifetime,
maybe.

1000
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,960
Maybe a hundred years maybe.
Sort of like comparing Christianity from

1001
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:54,740
the inquisition to today.
Yeah.

1002
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:56,800
Like so they need it needs to somehow or
another catch up.

1003
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,500
Yeah.
And and maybe 500 years a,

1004
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:01,660
well,
for the planet's sake,

1005
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,610
I think we haven't been as aliens
haven't come to this planet because they

1006
00:38:06,611 --> 00:38:07,810
look at us,
we're all fucked up.

1007
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,990
He's always saying,
yeah,

1008
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:15,030
do you contemplate this
car with a glass of Scotch calling?

1009
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:18,350
We're a fucking aliens here.
I want to shoot Ya.

1010
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,980
Yeah.
I don't think they're interested in what

1011
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:22,960
are we going to get?
What are they going to learn from us?

1012
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,870
Well,
I would be absolutely fascinated if I

1013
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:30,130
found a group of chimpanzees that had
figured out how to make fire with sticks

1014
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:33,220
and we're building structures and we're
starting some sort of a,

1015
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:36,360
an organized war against other,
uh,

1016
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,240
I would be absolutely fascinated if they
had weapons and they were sneaking up on

1017
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:41,980
these other chimps and using spears,
I'd be like,

1018
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:43,270
Holy Shit,
look at this.

1019
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,370
This is us a long time ago.
Well,

1020
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,770
I would imagine that aliens would feel
the same way about us.

1021
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,601
Well,
I mean,

1022
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:51,750
except that there are probably a million
years advanced maybe,

1023
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:54,120
or maybe a hundred years advanced.
Well,

1024
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:56,370
if there are a hundred years advanced,
I think they would've come down and see,

1025
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,110
maybe they're not ready yet.
Yeah,

1026
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,410
well it'd be a hundred years from now.
We won't be ready to go to other

1027
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:02,390
planets,
but maybe someone out there is just a

1028
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:03,870
little bit more advanced than us now.

1029
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,630
I,
the Elon Musk wants to die on Mars.

1030
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,190
That mother fucker's ridiculous.
Okay.

1031
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:11,350
He wants to die on Mars in an electric
car.

1032
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,650
And the,
uh,

1033
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,890
you know,
when the first electric car was Joe.

1034
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,881
Yeah.
Long time ago.

1035
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:19,030
It was in the early 1900 [inaudible]
1860s was it really?

1036
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,910
Okay.
If we really wanted electric cars,

1037
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,810
it was the first car for 2030 years ago,
and yet if we really wanted electric

1038
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:27,150
cars,
don't you think we could have developed

1039
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:27,850
them by now?

1040
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,230
Well,
we definitely should have,

1041
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:31,000
but the influence of the fossil fuel,

1042
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,153
correct?
Yeah.

1043
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,980
And do you know why Aramco is going
public?

1044
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,040
The a a national oil company of Saudi
Arabia?

1045
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,120
No.
Okay.

1046
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,500
You're going to hear it first here.
Jesus can't believe they're selling 2%

1047
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:46,410
of the company,
not because they need money,

1048
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,420
because they've got all the money in the
world.

1049
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,170
They want it because when you go public,
you have to have a reserve report.

1050
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,390
The reserve report,
he's going to show how many barrels they

1051
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:58,020
have proved producing,
proved unproved

1052
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,240
and we've been guesstimating for years
and years and years that Aramco has got

1053
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,370
a couple of hundred million barrels,
maybe three,

1054
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:06,660
four,
500 million barrels,

1055
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,890
billion barrels.
Excuse me.

1056
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,920
That report's going to show they have
trillions of barrels and there's no

1057
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:16,950
fucking way they're ever going to let
fracking,

1058
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,780
electric cars or anything else when
they're out of their trillions of

1059
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,250
barrels,
then they're going to let electric cars

1060
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:24,570
come to pass.

1061
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,630
So you think like all these oil crisis
warnings and all the talk about them

1062
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:31,430
running out of oil and places is all
bullshit.

1063
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,460
Yep.
A hundred percent hundred.

1064
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,640
What do you think oil is?
Okay,

1065
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,520
let me just back up a second.
And August,

1066
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,790
2014 I was on a a not a show is
procedure.

1067
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,470
This is yours,
but at some other guy show,

1068
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,290
and I said that when oil was $120 a
barrel,

1069
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,510
we will see $40 oil before we see $200
oil.

1070
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,760
A bet.
Both of my testicles.

1071
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,920
Oh strong.
Okay.

1072
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,590
In February last year,
oil hit $26 a barrel.

1073
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:03,910
Today's 48 wow.
Now there's a whole bunch of reasons

1074
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:06,760
why.
I know that having done business in the

1075
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,950
Middle East,
knowing Aramco has got hundreds of

1076
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,430
trillions of barrels.
Knowing that when the king of Saudi

1077
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,110
Arabia passed away about a year and a
half ago,

1078
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,770
and his brother who's a considered not,
uh,

1079
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,390
is bright as his brother,
half brother died and who hates

1080
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:26,350
Americans allegedly,
and who is sick and tired of hearing

1081
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:29,770
about fracking,
that we're going to end the frackers

1082
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:31,510
forever.
And so they,

1083
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:32,940
and there's no way,
eh,

1084
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,100
see OPEC is great

1085
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,370
except there's no accountability.
There's only two countries in the world

1086
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:40,730
that actually I hear to OPEC,
Canada,

1087
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,040
three countries,
Canada,

1088
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,070
the US and UK,
everybody else cheats.

1089
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,120
How so they,
they,

1090
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,910
they,
they produce as much oil as they want.

1091
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,290
So what is OPEC has regulations on how
much oil you can produce.

1092
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,480
Correct.
And why did they have those regulations?

1093
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,430
Because they kept the market.
He correct.

1094
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:00,980
So they don't drive down the price of
the market.

1095
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:04,560
So now what they're doing with fracking
is they're making oil in America so

1096
00:42:04,561 --> 00:42:07,560
readily available that the s what
they're doing in the Middle East is

1097
00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:10,410
dropping the price down low so that the
fracking is not worth doing.

1098
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,970
And a barrel of oil at the wellhead from
a frack.

1099
00:42:15,971 --> 00:42:18,490
Well,
the cost is about 80 bucks a barrel.

1100
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,800
Ah,
you just get it there and not to get it

1101
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:22,900
in the pipeline,
not to get it to the refinery is not the

1102
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:24,460
end doing that.
80 bucks a barrel.

1103
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,060
So if they keep all between 40 and 60
for the next a hundred years,

1104
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,380
well the frackers are fucked.
Yeah.

1105
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:33,020
And

1106
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,410
well,
how,

1107
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,110
what do you,
how do you feel about fracking?

1108
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:39,040
Because I've heard mixed stories about
fracking or mixed mixed reports and

1109
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,760
mixed mixed opinions.
Some people believe that it's a good way

1110
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:47,761
for us to be independent with our oil
and to break off from this whole weird

1111
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:49,720
sort of crisis and this,
this,

1112
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:51,400
uh,
situation that we have with the Middle

1113
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,800
East and other people feel like it's
super dangerous.

1114
00:42:53,801 --> 00:42:56,980
And what we're doing is where
potentially poisoning water supplies,

1115
00:42:56,981 --> 00:43:00,760
we are creating earthquakes in some
place that's as stable as Oklahoma,

1116
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:04,090
which was like seismically,
it was a nonentity,

1117
00:43:04,091 --> 00:43:05,950
like never had any issues with
earthquakes.

1118
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:08,920
Now they have tons of earthquakes and
they're just constantly drilling into

1119
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:10,120
the ground.
And who knows where the content,

1120
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,000
well,
both,

1121
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,480
both of those theories are correct,
both of the theories,

1122
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,760
but I'm not a save the world kind of
guy.

1123
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,800
What are you a slash and burn type of
now?

1124
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,810
No,
not slash and burn.

1125
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:23,870
But I believe that if there is a higher
power,

1126
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:26,870
he helps those who help themselves.
So I mean,

1127
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,291
uh,
I,

1128
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,990
and it's convenient to think like that
though.

1129
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:30,200
Well,
I think it is.

1130
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:31,100
That's why I think that way.

1131
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,160
But if he helps those that help
themselves,

1132
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:36,900
wouldn't he not help people who had
poison the waters supply?

1133
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:37,900
Well,
I mean,

1134
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,460
that's an exaggeration.
It's not,

1135
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,240
it's not poisoning
the water supply like,

1136
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,871
uh,
like,

1137
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,610
uh,
the protesters are saying,

1138
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,720
but by the same token,
why frack?

1139
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,280
When,
if my theory is correct about Saudi

1140
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,410
Arabia having hundreds of trillions and
they're never going to,

1141
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:01,390
you know,
they're never going to allow the fracked

1142
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,380
oil to come to market.
Why do it right?

1143
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,580
If they're never going a lot of correct.
Okay.

1144
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,580
So the fracked oil,
what are they doing with it right now?

1145
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,960
Well,
right now,

1146
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,150
uh,
fracking is down like 70 or 80%.

1147
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,021
It is.
Yes,

1148
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:15,040
it is.
Um,

1149
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,350
why is it down?
Because the price of oil.

1150
00:44:17,351 --> 00:44:18,490
Yeah,
exactly.

1151
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,770
It has nothing to do with environmental
concerns.

1152
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,810
No,
I mean it's just like I'm,

1153
00:44:22,811 --> 00:44:26,010
Obama didn't want the pipeline because
of environment concerns,

1154
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:29,500
Dakota access pipeline,
but it all started during his watch.

1155
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,490
Yeah,
I understand that.

1156
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,490
But now trump has says that you can have
the pipeline because he's looked at the

1157
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:40,800
same studies that I've looked at and
it's all online on Google is that there

1158
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:44,790
is this much,
the United States and the environmental

1159
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,820
things may be hurting is this much in
the United States.

1160
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,380
So you're talking,
you made your,

1161
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:51,570
spread your arms up very wide for people
listening.

1162
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,130
Okay.
And then when you said the about an

1163
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,140
environmental concerns,
you put it very small.

1164
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,900
Correct.
But isn't it something that if we could

1165
00:44:57,901 --> 00:45:00,630
avoid those very small environmental
disasters,

1166
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,460
so it was very small environmental
disasters,

1167
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,670
they're going to impact that area for
thousands of years.

1168
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,780
Correct.
I mean,

1169
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:08,460
it's a,
it's a significant issue.

1170
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,930
I'm sure it is.
But I mean,

1171
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:11,240
there's more than that.
You know,

1172
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,300
there's the,
the one side of an argument,

1173
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:18,390
the other side of the argument and then
somewhere in between is the truth.

1174
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,770
I mean,
the truth lies.

1175
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:24,450
But do you think that's the only way for
us to prosper is to put those areas in

1176
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:24,991
danger?
I mean,

1177
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:26,780
if you,
if you say that it,

1178
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:28,730
it,
there is a potentially a,

1179
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,520
there's a potential for an environmental
disaster that could affect that area for

1180
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:36,300
thousands of years.
Take that risk for financial gain.

1181
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,500
No,
not from to Fresno.

1182
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,970
No,
I'm not saying for financial gain.

1183
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,150
It's not a financial,
you know,

1184
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,330
of course it's a financial gain.
I was in the oil business for 20 years

1185
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,690
now,
allegedly,

1186
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,100
where I made my fortune,
but the allegedly,

1187
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,413
allegedly,
yeah,

1188
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,600
I've got other things very successfully,
but that's the one that they talk about.

1189
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,960
I turned $800 into $500 million in eight
years.

1190
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,000
And so forevermore I'm an oil man.
Okay.

1191
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,700
But I did,
I've created 50 billion since then.

1192
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,200
So I mean,
what's more important to 50 billion to

1193
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:07,034
the 500 million?

1194
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,680
So I got it.
Okay,

1195
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,110
okay.
But the,

1196
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,491
the,
the,

1197
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:14,430
the fact is that
politically,

1198
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:17,490
whoever gets in office,
and right now we have trump and he's

1199
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:19,380
backed by the Senate and the congress,
et Cetera.

1200
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,710
Um,
it has promised to be like an

1201
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:24,060
isolationist,
more or less.

1202
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,240
He's not interested in the wards around.
And I'm not saying that's right or

1203
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:28,800
wrong,
I'm just saying that's his position.

1204
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:32,100
And a majority of the electoral votes
got him elected.

1205
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,530
Not The popular vote,
but electoral votes.

1206
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,700
Okay?
So,

1207
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,140
uh,
the,

1208
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:42,350
but whether the United States of America
is a ruining parts of it,

1209
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,750
500 years from now,
there'll be ruined a while whilst

1210
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:52,380
important.
It is not the overriding,

1211
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,210
um,
energy,

1212
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,050
pun intended,
uh,

1213
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,570
of what we should be thinking about.
What we should be thinking about is

1214
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,340
doing away with war,
you know,

1215
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,410
uh,
uh,

1216
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,710
living,
uh,

1217
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,590
happily,
you know,

1218
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,900
and I ain't even,
I believe that and I'm,

1219
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,980
and I'm an aggressive guy,
but that model hasn't worked.

1220
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:17,000
Why is that?
Well,

1221
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,000
a,
why were,

1222
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,680
there's still wars?
Well,

1223
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:22,140
I mean,
when you talk about the Iraq war and

1224
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:25,020
talk about the Afghanistan war,
those are the longest wars we've engaged

1225
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:26,430
in the United States.
And we didn't have to be there.

1226
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,510
Right?
No,

1227
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:32,511
I understand that.
But how are we going to keep people

1228
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:33,700
elected?
Those people,

1229
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,350
they put us there.
Right?

1230
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,750
Just like the people elected trump to
put him there,

1231
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,900
just like they elected Clinton to put
him there.

1232
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,200
Right.
And we still,

1233
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,720
we're still in wars.
Right.

1234
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,530
But Clinton didn't do it.
I mean this was all post nine 11 and

1235
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,150
there were,
there was obviously some military

1236
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:50,860
actions that were involved when Clinton
was in office,

1237
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:55,450
but when Bill Clinton was president,
it was one of the most peaceful times in

1238
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:57,100
the history of this country.
When you agree.

1239
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,190
Um,
he took out a Haiti,

1240
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,800
he followed up on the Dan Pena plan to
take out Haiti.

1241
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,170
That was the Dan Pena Plan.
The CIA.

1242
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:06,310
Dan Penn.
Your trademark.

1243
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,293
Yes.
Well,

1244
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,860
I can coin it now,
but I mean,

1245
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:12,430
don't you think that in terms of like if
you compare pre,

1246
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,330
uh,
Bush,

1247
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:13,931
you know,
when,

1248
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:17,440
when nine 11 happened from then on,
we've been in this perpetual state of

1249
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:19,720
war,
but during the entire eight years of

1250
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:21,520
Clinton was in office,
although there were some military

1251
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:23,520
actions,
one of the more peaceful times,

1252
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,970
they probably was.
You're probably right.

1253
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:25,570
Yeah.
Well,

1254
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,160
well,
there wasn't as much worry as a risk

1255
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:28,420
today.
Like today,

1256
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:30,670
it seems like there's threats of
terrorism.

1257
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:35,320
We're worried about North Korea
instability all around the globe.

1258
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,690
I went to,
here's something else for the first on

1259
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:42,360
your program.
Who Do you think killed the president's

1260
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,120
half brother of North Korea?
Didn't they like hire some people?

1261
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:48,160
They thought it was a prank.
Well,

1262
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:49,390
that's what the story is.

1263
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,201
Oh,
was a different story.

1264
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:50,830
Yeah,
no,

1265
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,120
true.
That the,

1266
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,370
well,
the North Koreans think that the South

1267
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:58,090
Koreans did it right.
I think that USA CIA did it well.

1268
00:48:58,091 --> 00:49:01,510
I thought the North Koreans thought that
the s the brother did it,

1269
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,610
that Kim Jong Ooh.
And did it too.

1270
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

1271
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:07,690
Because the brother was kind of sneaked
to send a message to North Korea.

1272
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,510
Really?
What kind of messages that,

1273
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,310
I mean that don't,
don't fuck with us.

1274
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,080
Oh,
it seems like they could do a better job

1275
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:15,280
of sending that message.
Well,

1276
00:49:15,281 --> 00:49:16,900
I mean,
they killed him I guess,

1277
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:18,420
but who is he?
He wasn't even in the,

1278
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:18,941
no,
no,

1279
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:20,930
but I mean they believe you can kill the
half-brother.

1280
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,260
The president can kill the president.
Well that will probably be a better

1281
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:24,970
idea.
But if they did do that,

1282
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:26,320
don't you think it would just create a
vacuum?

1283
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:27,890
Like the same thing that happened and I
don't really,

1284
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,590
I don't read enough books to know that I
don't read any books on and Libya,

1285
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:35,650
but I've watched a lot of documentaries
on that whole Kadafi situation.

1286
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,780
That's a complete cluster fuck.
Well,

1287
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:41,050
I mean the United States government has
been doing that for a hundred years,

1288
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,360
where they back the government,
it turned out to be a crooked

1289
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:45,840
government.
So then they got to go take all the

1290
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,230
backing away from him and then avoid
[inaudible] is created.

1291
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,510
And then the guys,
they come in or worse,

1292
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,140
yeah.
What's going on in their rack,

1293
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:54,491
right?
Yeah.

1294
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,220
We've been doing that for them.
And then,

1295
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,000
and,
but,

1296
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,620
but what's happening in Libya and Libya
is a basically a failed state.

1297
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,240
It's a scary,
scary place right now.

1298
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:02,140
And,
uh,

1299
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,210
if you talk to people that were there
pre,

1300
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,460
uh,
pre Kadafi or during Qaddafi's

1301
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,480
administration,
now they're like,

1302
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:10,420
it's way safer then when Kadafi was
running things.

1303
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,240
Obviously if you were a,
an enemy of Kadafi,

1304
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:15,790
it wasn't safe for you.
He was all a brutal dictator.

1305
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,430
But the,
the business of running countries,

1306
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:20,800
especially running countries all around
the world is a horrible,

1307
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:22,300
horrible,
messy business.

1308
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,500
You know,
Messi,

1309
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,170
brutal evil business.
It's always underestimated.

1310
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,580
And I'm,
one of my favorite sayings is never

1311
00:50:28,581 --> 00:50:31,070
underestimate how wrong you can be.
And,

1312
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:31,940
uh,
the,

1313
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:33,720
uh,
and we always seem to underestimate it.

1314
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,790
Um,
and um,

1315
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,240
I don't think that's going to change.
Is it?

1316
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:39,200
Right?
We're going to get better.

1317
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,243
I mean,
we've gotten better.

1318
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,050
We've gotten better.
I mean since caveman,

1319
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:44,030
since that,
since that chimpanzee to learn how to

1320
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:45,200
use a rock.
That's what I'm saying.

1321
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,550
Yeah.
Well we've gotten better.

1322
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,630
I mean,
but,

1323
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,210
uh,
we've been getting better for 40,000

1324
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:54,500
years and the planet's been alive for
13.8 billion years,

1325
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,810
but we've only had Google for like 20 Oh
yeah.

1326
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:57,471
Well that,
well,

1327
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,470
I'm,
I'm not such a proponent of that Google

1328
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:01,070
is going to change the world,
but I don't think so.

1329
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,670
No,
I'd Ha,

1330
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:05,150
well,
not like the millennials think or the,

1331
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:06,960
or maybe,
I don't know.

1332
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,570
I'm a generation X.
I guess.

1333
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:10,700
It's funny,
that whole generation thing,

1334
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,660
we get labels.
I think there's a real possibility that

1335
00:51:14,661 --> 00:51:16,970
information,
and I think there's a lot of,

1336
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,910
there's some battles going on right now
with information where people trying to

1337
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:23,760
figure out how it should affect things
and what it should affect and,

1338
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:25,850
and what,
what kind of an impact it's ultimately

1339
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:27,920
going to have in our culture.
But I think it's having a massive

1340
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,390
impact.
And I think it's hard for us to,

1341
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,280
yeah,
which is why I said Google,

1342
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,860
but google meaning the ability to search
things,

1343
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,470
you know,
there's going be a big access to

1344
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:40,270
information through those portals dated
with instant information.

1345
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,600
Yeah.
I mean,

1346
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:47,110
what took guys years,
the research for a phd paper can be now

1347
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:51,500
researched in days,
weeks or that,

1348
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,830
yeah,
it's a magical time when it comes to

1349
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:55,430
that.

1350
00:51:55,430 --> 00:52:00,430
And I feel like that if anything is
gonna change foreign countries quicker

1351
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,520
than any other kind of change because I
feel like just having the access to the

1352
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,550
information that things are different or
the parts of the world that people are

1353
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,680
thinking differently than they ever
thought before,

1354
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,570
that there's more understanding about
people that we have more in common than

1355
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:17,540
we do.
Then this idea that countries are

1356
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:19,730
against each other,
the countries are there consistent of

1357
00:52:19,731 --> 00:52:21,680
people that don't even know each other
for the most part.

1358
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,620
And we're supposed to be against some
other people that we don't know.

1359
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,150
And then some of the part of the world.
Well,

1360
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:27,820
why is it then,
um,

1361
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,630
tenement square in,
in,

1362
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,030
uh,
Beijing 30,

1363
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:34,290
whatever years ago it was,
uh,

1364
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:36,140
when we were in China,
uh,

1365
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,450
not too long ago as it gets to the
government,

1366
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,870
uh,
most kids don't even know that that

1367
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:42,320
happened.

1368
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,360
Yeah.
Because they have google.

1369
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,340
Okay.
Same in Russia.

1370
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,100
Uh,
salmon countries in South America.

1371
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:52,360
Now getting back to why,
uh,

1372
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:52,890
the,
uh,

1373
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,220
the oil,
uh,

1374
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:59,420
hydrocarbons are so important.
Russia's got a oil driven economy.

1375
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:03,190
Now a good,
many of the countries in South America

1376
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:06,620
have oil driven economies.
Now Canada has an old driven economy.

1377
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:08,120
Now,
uh,

1378
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,820
the U K arguably has an old driven
economy,

1379
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,740
not visa vi the North Sea.
Okay.

1380
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,850
Uh,
the u s it doesn't really have an old

1381
00:53:15,851 --> 00:53:17,270
driven economy,
but it has a big,

1382
00:53:17,271 --> 00:53:22,271
big part of what happens now when you
are making loans from financial

1383
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:27,600
institutions at a hundred,
$120 oil with projections because some

1384
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:30,570
dip Shit Mba did a spreadsheet on them,
uh,

1385
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:35,040
to a $200 oil and you make loans.
And now all those loans are underwater,

1386
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,740
pun intended for the offshore stuff.
So is that what happened?

1387
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:40,740
They made loans based on the prediction
that it would continue to go up.

1388
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:45,300
So some sort of a universal growth or
continual growth paradigm,

1389
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,560
but anybody that's from the business,
like I was knew that that was horseshit.

1390
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,520
Why did they think that unlimited growth
in oil was going to happen and it was

1391
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,520
going to get to $200 a bottle if guys
are barrel rather if guys like you

1392
00:53:56,521 --> 00:54:01,521
thought it was horse shit because a
whole other generation has come up,

1393
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:05,220
it didn't suffer.
The last oral decline that lasts oil

1394
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:07,920
decline was w is the early eighties
through the mid eighties.

1395
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:11,910
When oil went from $40 a barrel.
If they $6 a barrel and then went back

1396
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:15,870
up to $35 a barrel,
all those guys are either dead in jail

1397
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:17,910
or retired.
Okay.

1398
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:21,180
And now they've got young guys who
learned something in a book.

1399
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,060
I went to good schools and know how to
do spreadsheets,

1400
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:26,910
et Cetera,
but they don't have the experience.

1401
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,200
And,
uh,

1402
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,063
the,
you know,

1403
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,320
we have tons and tons of information but
we'll,

1404
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,250
we don't have running a lot of the
companies is tons and tons of

1405
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:36,084
experience.

1406
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:39,960
We have a lot of dots,
but we don't have the people that have

1407
00:54:39,961 --> 00:54:44,760
connected the dots now to connect the
dots to find out how much the Middle

1408
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,880
East actually has in barrels of oil is
trillions of bows.

1409
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:49,230
Well,
how would one do that?

1410
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,210
Well,
is this public information like what

1411
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:53,010
you're saying?
Most people don't know.

1412
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,540
They don't know.
Well,

1413
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,420
because I was partners with Kuwaiti
government for seven years.

1414
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,970
I used to be their fair haired boy for
investment.

1415
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,340
Uh,
and I,

1416
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,780
you could,
you a fair haired boy,

1417
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:04,860
fair haired boy.
Yeah.

1418
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,800
What does that mean?
A fair haired boy means that I was their

1419
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:08,900
favorite.
That's a what?

1420
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,680
A weird expression and a fair haired
boy.

1421
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:11,760
I,
fair haired.

1422
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,110
I want black hair.
Right?

1423
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:14,730
Okay.
I have blue eyes.

1424
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,980
I'm fairing my complexion.
Got It.

1425
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,670
Okay.
That's what I get it.

1426
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:19,743
It's,
it's weird.

1427
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,600
Yeah.
And,

1428
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:21,443
and,
and um,

1429
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,900
I think it's very surprising and Aramco
is going to go public with the numbers

1430
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,380
because it's been one of the great big
secrets of all time and the energy

1431
00:55:28,381 --> 00:55:28,910
business.

1432
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,060
They're going public with the numbers to
discourage further frack.

1433
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,790
Correct.
So they're going to say,

1434
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,870
look,
we,

1435
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:36,300
we,
we would rather have 100% of this thing

1436
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:37,940
at half the price.
Correct.

1437
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,210
Then lose it all.
Correct.

1438
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:43,980
And the um,
most of the ultra alternative energy

1439
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:46,950
deals,
the in the United States in the UK are

1440
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:51,180
funded by grants,
government programs that fail.

1441
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,310
I mean,
they don't make you,

1442
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:57,210
they don't make any money,
but when you stopped doing that,

1443
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,970
the average,
the average cost for a barrel of oil,

1444
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,490
not fracking in this country,
uh,

1445
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,260
is about 45,
50 bucks a barrel.

1446
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,630
Who right at the break even to bring it
up to the wellhead now.

1447
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,460
Okay.
In the Middle East,

1448
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,370
taking all of them in into account,
it's about three bucks,

1449
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,970
a berry dollars a barrel,
a couple of the countries less than a

1450
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:18,720
buck flow.
How the fuck can they do then?

1451
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,900
Because the oil is right there here.
[inaudible] and they found oil.

1452
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:29,140
They were living in tents as better wins
and they were looking for water cause

1453
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:31,540
they'd be dead.
Now if they hadn't found water a hundred

1454
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,373
years ago,
they'd all be dead.

1455
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,840
But they,
they didn't need the water cause they

1456
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:39,841
got the oil that they paid to take to
make the water drinkable.

1457
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,230
D salient.
Incorrect.

1458
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,460
That's the word I was looking for.
Yeah.

1459
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,350
So this,
this is,

1460
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,940
this is,
that's an amazing thing.

1461
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:49,810
So why is Exxon bothering to drill in
the Gulf coast?

1462
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:54,580
Because hope springs eternal.
So they want to plan for the future.

1463
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,310
Correct.
I drilled in the Gulf coast,

1464
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,740
um,
when I was winning a big oil company,

1465
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,360
uh,
and the,

1466
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:03,370
uh,
and there's two parts of the Gulf coast.

1467
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,210
There's the shelf,
which is a 600 feet deep.

1468
00:57:07,211 --> 00:57:09,750
And then there's beyond the shelf,
which is like 10,000 feet.

1469
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,860
And that's big,
big money to do all those tests.

1470
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,180
Wells,
uh,

1471
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:13,960
and,
uh,

1472
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,840
the big guys like Exxon are looking for
elephants.

1473
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,850
They're looking for the big,
big reserves,

1474
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,240
a smaller independence like I was was
looking for a,

1475
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:23,410
you know,
the smaller reserves.

1476
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,100
No want to Exxon goes and looks for the
big reserves to what kind of equipment

1477
00:57:27,101 --> 00:57:29,800
did they use to dick to decide where the
oil is?

1478
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:30,480
Well,
uh,

1479
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,480
an offshore drilling rig will cost
between a in the shallow at 25 to 40

1480
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,410
million and in the deep,
uh,

1481
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,350
uh,
75 to 250 million for just the rig.

1482
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,920
The thing.
So how do they know where the oil,

1483
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:47,260
so they have geologists,
which you're like,

1484
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,240
ah,
this is a personal point of view.

1485
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,990
Geologists.
Geophysicist.

1486
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,750
Yeah,
exactly.

1487
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,560
You're better off with a psychic.
So they basically know there's a shit

1488
00:57:57,561 --> 00:58:02,260
load of oil out there somewhere.
Drilling now what is oil?

1489
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,670
Explain to me what is oil?

1490
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,130
I read a book a long time ago.
The confused the fuck out of me.

1491
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:08,740
It was called black gold stranglehold
and know if you've heard about it.

1492
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:09,760
I've heard of it.
I never read it.

1493
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:14,740
It was a book that was saying that oil
is not fossil fuels and then it's not

1494
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,880
what people think it is,
but it's actually a renewal process that

1495
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:22,330
the earth creates this oil and that
wells go dry.

1496
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:23,860
And then if you leave them alone for a
while,

1497
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:25,090
they build up with the oil.
Again,

1498
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,640
not why they,
that's the theory.

1499
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:32,020
But nobody's ever left the well alone
alone long enough to find out if that's

1500
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:33,040
true or not.
Ah,

1501
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:35,200
so we're talking about hundreds of
thousands of years.

1502
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:37,570
They're not talking about 40 years.
So no,

1503
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,810
but wells also this guy,
it might be,

1504
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,710
it seemed like a wacky book.
It was one of those books.

1505
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,870
I was reading of your word,
the holographic universe.

1506
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,040
No,
it's another book.

1507
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:46,690
Quick halfway in the book.
I'm like,

1508
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:49,420
what the fuck am I reading?
This is a goofy ass book.

1509
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:53,050
It's just too much goofiness in it.
But that Black Gold's triangle hold,

1510
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,300
I wanted to talk to a real oil man about
this.

1511
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:00,540
So oil is created by what things dying
deteriorating from 40,

1512
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:02,320
50,
a hundred million years ago.

1513
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:06,090
Uh,
and they sit under the ground and they a

1514
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,160
form hydrocarbons,
uh,

1515
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:13,200
two different kinds of hydrocarbons.
Either that's a gas and oil and uh,

1516
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,740
and when the,
when it comes up that comes up one pipe

1517
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:20,230
and there's a separator.
Sometimes you just have a pure oil

1518
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:21,064
wells.
Sometimes you have it,

1519
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,690
a pure gas well,
but mostly you have a mix.

1520
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,960
So there's a separator.
It's a unit that is a,

1521
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:27,470
uh,
engineers,

1522
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:30,200
a wet dream at the top that separates
all this.

1523
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:34,760
Then it's put into a pipeline and taken
to a refinery or it's put into a truck

1524
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,110
and taken to a refinery.
Uh,

1525
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,600
and some of the,
um,

1526
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,501
the,
the,

1527
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:40,900
the,
the distillate,

1528
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,940
the actual or oil,
it's a,

1529
00:59:42,941 --> 00:59:45,350
depending on the gravity can go straight
into a car.

1530
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:46,640
I mean,
that's how pure realist,

1531
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,290
yeah.
And doesn't have to be refined.

1532
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:51,590
Of course the refiners don't like those
kind of wells because then they,

1533
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,110
what is it when it's,
when you don't have to refine it?

1534
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,050
I mean,
it has been sat under the ground,

1535
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,570
the oil,
the less time it's been under the

1536
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:02,150
ground.
So if you've got moral that's been there

1537
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:05,600
40 million years,
it will look like kerosene.

1538
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,390
If you've got an oil that it's only been
there 10 million years,

1539
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:11,120
it look a black and gunky.
Oh,

1540
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:13,250
that's fascinating.
Now it's,

1541
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,210
we used to call it dead dinosaurs,
but it's not really animal matter as

1542
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,170
much as it is plant matter.

1543
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,530
Is that true plant?
Yeah,

1544
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,480
mostly planning on,
yeah.

1545
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,920
So it's just a teary or rating leaves
and trees and things along those lines.

1546
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,620
And then it's slowly but surely over
millions of years becomes oil.

1547
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,300
What a weird thing to power our world
on.

1548
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,430
Well,
I mean it's,

1549
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:33,920
it's,
it's been around a long time,

1550
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,050
but if we really wanted to electric
batteries,

1551
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:39,890
we've had those 40 years longer than
we've had a gasoline cars.

1552
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,270
What are your feelings on solar solar?
Um,

1553
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,900
you probably don't know this,
but for every square foot on the earth,

1554
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,620
the sun,
natural sun with no nothing,

1555
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,870
uh,
uh,

1556
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:58,090
advancing the Sun's light gives between
10 and 13,000 times more energy than the

1557
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:03,740
planet needs.
10 to 13,000 for every square foot just

1558
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:06,230
from the sun.
Whoa.

1559
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,490
Wait a minute.
Hold on,

1560
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,930
let me,
let me sort that out.

1561
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:14,230
So what you mean is if you put solar
panels on every square foot,

1562
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:18,560
you'd have 10 to 13 times more than the
planet needs.

1563
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,730
Yes.
Einstein.

1564
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:22,340
Correct.
But you wouldn't really put solar powers

1565
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:26,990
over the whole correct planet.
So in order to be able to power a city,

1566
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,210
what would you have to do?
Well,

1567
01:01:29,211 --> 01:01:30,830
I mean the city,
like let's say,

1568
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:32,140
um,
[inaudible] alley.

1569
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,760
How dare you call me Einstein.
Okay.

1570
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,270
Uh,
the valley,

1571
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:36,403
the valley,
right.

1572
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:39,470
Okay.
You need solar panels that would cover

1573
01:01:39,471 --> 01:01:40,550
from,
um,

1574
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,080
downtown Los Angeles to
San Diego,

1575
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,260
Jesus Christ.
And that's under current solar

1576
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:52,160
technologies.
It's gotten much less expensive to do

1577
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:52,810
that,
right?

1578
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,830
Because then you've got to sell the
stuff into the grid.

1579
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,170
The grid,
meaning the power thing,

1580
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,440
like a scent.
Nuts.

1581
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,500
What's the power thing up here?
Uh,

1582
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:02,510
whatever the power company electric
company is.

1583
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,420
So you sell into the grid and they will
tell you,

1584
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,910
um,
when the government was giving

1585
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:11,960
subsidies,
they were paying like 18 to 20 cents per

1586
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,900
kilowatt.
Now they're paying two to 3 cents.

1587
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,270
So people invested,
schmucks,

1588
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:20,160
banks lend out Shannon's schmucks,

1589
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:26,020
lend out 10 hundreds of billions of
dollars to the solar guys because at the

1590
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,750
13 to 18 cents a megawatt and then
supply,

1591
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:34,560
then we had too much supply because
everybody's doing it and drove down the

1592
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:36,510
price.
And so now these poor bastards that

1593
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:38,370
started these solar deals,
uh,

1594
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,390
15,
20 years ago,

1595
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:40,590
can't make any money.

1596
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:45,080
So they can't pay off their debt.
The guys that benefit the most from

1597
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:50,081
solar or the farmers that own the land,
that lease to the solar companies.

1598
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,930
So it's another one of those unlimited
growth things where they felt like it

1599
01:02:53,931 --> 01:02:57,800
was 10 cents back then per kilowatt,
it's eventually going to be 20 and 30.

1600
01:02:57,801 --> 01:02:59,540
They kept thought it was going to go up
instead it went down.

1601
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:02,090
And why did it go down?
Because oversupply,

1602
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:05,600
because everybody gets on a a good thing
and then they make it bad.

1603
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,000
But when you say you sell it back to the
grid,

1604
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:09,890
there's also ways to do it.
To be off the grid,

1605
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:11,600
right.
Craft a different system.

1606
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

1607
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,390
There are.
Yeah.

1608
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,090
And a lot of,
uh,

1609
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:17,430
you know,
very bright guy put together a tax

1610
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,130
incentive deals,
uh,

1611
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,950
in the Britain they called schemes,
uh,

1612
01:03:22,951 --> 01:03:24,810
that,
uh,

1613
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,340
you know,
took advantage of the system.

1614
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,530
Uh,
right now in Germany for example,

1615
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:31,080
um,
Germany has a 20,

1616
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:33,780
25 year contracts and the government
wasn't any smarter.

1617
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:37,650
They gave you a 25 year contract at a
guarantee 11 cents.

1618
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,790
Okay.
Now into the grid,

1619
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,390
it's only 3 cents.
So they've got to pay you off and it was

1620
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,570
between three and 11 and uh,

1621
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,200
contract's up.
And then once it's up,

1622
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,370
everybody's screwed.
Everybody,

1623
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:51,390
you know,
everybody's screwed.

1624
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,880
Wow.
Now,

1625
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:57,330
do you think that it's a viable way to
power a city?

1626
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,433
Yeah,
it is.

1627
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,790
It is,
but I think it's a mix.

1628
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,860
You need a mix really not,
you know,

1629
01:04:01,861 --> 01:04:04,800
not just solar undercurrent,
technological solar,

1630
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:08,070
wind and a hydrocarbons.
Yeah.

1631
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:09,930
We were in,
some were filming something for fear

1632
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:12,870
factor wants and they had one of those,
a windmill farms.

1633
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,700
It was the craziest thing ever.
It was like,

1634
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,190
like a bunch of robots that were up on
this hill.

1635
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,870
Correct.
We're spinning around and was like,

1636
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:21,540
you're getting there getting electricity
from these wind robots.

1637
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:24,730
Like how fucking weird is this?
And each one of those deals costs

1638
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:27,240
roughly speaking of $1 million.
Wow.

1639
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,030
Each one,
uh,

1640
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,800
and uh,
the technology,

1641
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:31,910
uh,
has,

1642
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,340
has come a long,
long way and the 30 or 40 years that

1643
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:37,640
they've had those wind when deals,
but

1644
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:43,520
supposedly the wind currents don't
change [inaudible] wrong,

1645
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,020
wrong.
They do change.

1646
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:48,440
Okay.
And so you've built a hundred of these

1647
01:04:48,441 --> 01:04:50,560
windmills facing a certain way.
Right.

1648
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:53,660
Okay.
And then the wind changes for whatever

1649
01:04:53,661 --> 01:04:56,750
reason.
Now I know the thing you're going to

1650
01:04:56,751 --> 01:04:58,280
hear first.
Uh,

1651
01:04:58,281 --> 01:05:00,380
in 2011,
my wife and I,

1652
01:05:00,381 --> 01:05:03,710
we had our bows,
we knew it at the South Pole magnetic

1653
01:05:03,711 --> 01:05:07,130
south pole.
We went to be married down and they have

1654
01:05:07,131 --> 01:05:11,120
a huge $500 million scientific research
lab,

1655
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,460
most of which is paid for by the United
States government.

1656
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,100
So we're down there and we're talking to
all the goofball scientists around in

1657
01:05:18,101 --> 01:05:19,810
shorts,
tee shirts and flip flops.

1658
01:05:19,811 --> 01:05:22,000
And it's 40 below zero.
Okay.

1659
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,440
Cause it sun never goes down.

1660
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:25,210
This was December.
Uh,

1661
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:28,270
and so they're giving us a presentation
and they're bringing out these cores of

1662
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:33,190
ice cores of ice and they get to the
second or third corps and then he says,

1663
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:36,190
this core is 55,000 years old.
And of course I'm a,

1664
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:37,330
how do you know that?
Anyway,

1665
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:41,320
they explained and he said,
I'm 13,000 years ago.

1666
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:44,650
This was the temperature of 14,050 5,000
years ago.

1667
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,650
It was two degrees warmer Celsius than
it is today.

1668
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:53,250
And then you go stop 55,000 years ago.
It was two degrees warmer than it is

1669
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:57,160
today,
right?

1670
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,020
And I said,
what about global warming?

1671
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,370
Okay,

1672
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:03,190
simultaneously all 10 and start
laughing.

1673
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:07,840
All 10 phds from Mit,
Caltech,

1674
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:12,841
snapper started laughing when they laugh
because global warming is a joke.

1675
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:16,070
How's global warming a joke?
I'm just telling you what they said.

1676
01:06:16,071 --> 01:06:17,840
It was warmer.
Two degrees Celsius,

1677
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,970
but that's a 55,000 years ago.
Well,

1678
01:06:19,971 --> 01:06:23,420
if you go back 65 million years ago is
considerably warmer than I understand

1679
01:06:23,421 --> 01:06:24,890
that.
But what they were saying is that it's

1680
01:06:24,891 --> 01:06:25,760
cyclical,
right?

1681
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:29,540
But I don't think that's the argument.
The argument is whether or not we're

1682
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:31,730
contributing to this cyclical.
I'm sure we are.

1683
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:32,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

1684
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,760
But I mean,
if we wait 10,000 years,

1685
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,970
there won't be any global warming.
It'll go back to cold.

1686
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,650
Correct.
And the people,

1687
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:42,350
you're descendants,
my descendants,

1688
01:06:42,351 --> 01:06:45,780
if they're around 10,000 years from now,
we'll read about that.

1689
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:48,440
Who are those guys have believed in
global warming.

1690
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:52,040
So you think that people are being
hysterical about a natural cycle that we

1691
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,210
probably are.

1692
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,120
We're,
we're probably helping it along.

1693
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:58,100
We're helping it along,
but it's a natural cycle,

1694
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:59,530
but it's going to come back around
anyway.

1695
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,030
Another point,
if global warming,

1696
01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:03,020
we're for real,
I mean,

1697
01:07:03,021 --> 01:07:03,381
real,
real,

1698
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:06,110
real that's going to happen is he's
going to have next 20,

1699
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,850
30 years.
Okay.

1700
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:12,500
Florida,
most of Central America,

1701
01:07:12,501 --> 01:07:15,530
a whole bunch of the part of the world
is going to be gone because there'll be

1702
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,670
underwater,
right?

1703
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,870
Depending on,
you know,

1704
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:18,770
the most,
uh,

1705
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,851
uh,
severe,

1706
01:07:19,851 --> 01:07:22,460
it's 30 meters of water.
That's a hundred feet.

1707
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:24,950
The less severe is 10 meters of water.
30 feet.

1708
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,990
Okay.
If that were the case and you were

1709
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:29,120
building condominiums in Fort
Lauderdale,

1710
01:07:29,121 --> 01:07:32,220
Florida,
there should be a disclaimer in the

1711
01:07:32,221 --> 01:07:33,054
prospectus.

1712
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,540
Yeah,

1713
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,920
there should be a disclaimer.
The next big way,

1714
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:40,420
the class action lawsuits,
if global warming happens in the next 20

1715
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:43,180
to 50 years,
is going to be the disclaimers that were

1716
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:47,020
not written in an investment perspective
for condominiums,

1717
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,330
buildings everywhere.
Manhattan's gone,

1718
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,840
you know London has gone well,
that's only under severe forecast,

1719
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:56,210
right?
Severe forecasts.

1720
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,300
The best forecast is it's going to be 10
meters,

1721
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,680
10 meters.
We'll just dirty feet.

1722
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:03,040
That's the best forecasts,
the best forecasts over how many years?

1723
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:05,770
A 50 so you don't,
you don't think that's going to happen?

1724
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,240
I'm not likely to be here 50 years from
now,

1725
01:08:09,241 --> 01:08:12,120
so I had a pretty good dude if they keep
replacing shit.

1726
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,550
Yeah.
Well I'm pretty good.

1727
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,980
My,
my goal is 101

1728
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,920
yeah,
right now 70 I'll be 72 and a few weeks.

1729
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:19,840
You look great.
Yeah.

1730
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,590
Thank you.
Got a lot of pep to you now.

1731
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:23,130
So,
but I,

1732
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:25,250
I,
I'm happy cause I'm enjoying doing what

1733
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:28,910
I do.
Do you realize 87% Gallup poll came out

1734
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:31,100
last year.
It's at 87% of the people on the planet

1735
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:36,580
or unhappy with what their life is all
about now on have the and 10% in

1736
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:41,660
addition to that,
87 to 97 hate what they do.

1737
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:44,450
A little.
So that leaves 3% of the planet.

1738
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,000
Enjoy what they do.
And you're one of 3%.

1739
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:49,520
Fuck,
I'm one of the 100000000th of a percent.

1740
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:50,630
Uh,
I'm so happy.

1741
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:52,160
I don't know whether to shit or go
blind.

1742
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:54,560
Well,
you shouldn't do the second part.

1743
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:57,050
Every little behind a chair.
Don't go blind.

1744
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:57,441
No,
no,

1745
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:59,180
I don't think that makes you happier.
Well,

1746
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,210
they're going to,
they're going to figure out how to give

1747
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:02,840
me new eyes.

1748
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,670
They are,
do you think they're gonna figure out

1749
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:07,310
how to give you new eyes or do you think
they're going to figure out how to shoot

1750
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:09,590
some stem cells in your eyes or Ridgeway
and I'm uh,

1751
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,560
I want to hear after the program about
the stem cells in Vegas.

1752
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:14,180
Yeah.
They've got a lot of crazy shit going

1753
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:15,470
on.
They're doing discs now.

1754
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:16,370
They,
uh,

1755
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,620
are just starting,
uh,

1756
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:20,960
talked to Dr. Davidson from the UFC and
they're beginning trials.

1757
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,910
I think they were going to do it this
Monday,

1758
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,730
so past Monday,
a couple of days ago where they're going

1759
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:30,230
to shoot stem cells directly into discs
of people with degenerative disc disease

1760
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:34,100
where their discs are shrinking because
the compression of the spine and you

1761
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:36,260
know,
just overall life and wearing down,

1762
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,480
they're going to be able to regenerate
this tissue.

1763
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:38,900
Yeah.
Well,

1764
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,790
what's a story about,
I read a couple of days ago,

1765
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:44,990
um,
a transgender guy broke the eye socket

1766
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,020
of a girl in an MMA fight.

1767
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,260
I don't know about that.
Is that a recent,

1768
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,780
the last 48 hours to know about that.
Okay.

1769
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:58,400
And they're complaining because it's not
really a girl,

1770
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:02,210
it's a guy and he was just overpowered
and he just,

1771
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,730
no,
I've never heard of a broken eye socket.

1772
01:10:04,731 --> 01:10:06,770
And when those guys sockets are really
common,

1773
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:07,130
oh,
the,

1774
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:07,970
okay.
I didn't know that.

1775
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,380
And can I soccer?
It's broken.

1776
01:10:09,381 --> 01:10:11,510
Orbitals very,
very common.

1777
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:15,310
If you get punched or kicked or elbowed
really hard in the eyeball,

1778
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,120
which sounds horrible to people,
but uh,

1779
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:20,960
you get a blowout fracture where you
actually blow out the bone in the back

1780
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:23,300
of the eyeball.
So they have to literally take your eye

1781
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:27,230
out and they have to go behind it.
Repair usually at that,

1782
01:10:27,231 --> 01:10:30,620
sometimes they have to put like a little
plate or something that puts the bone

1783
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:33,440
back together in the back of your eye,
put your eye back in.

1784
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,470
And sometimes when guys do get those
kind of orbital fractures,

1785
01:10:36,471 --> 01:10:40,220
they have these weird eyes like the one
I that like pokes forward more than the

1786
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:41,390
other eyes.
It looks weird.

1787
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,900
Very Dangerous Sport,
very dangerous sport,

1788
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:47,030
you know,
it's just obviously it's a combat sport.

1789
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,370
Kind of smash each other.
Yeah,

1790
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:51,230
I've been pretty vocal about,
there was a,

1791
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:55,070
a a pretty famous case of a guy who had
been a guy for 30 years,

1792
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:56,750
became a woman for two years,
you know,

1793
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:58,490
or you know,
went transgender,

1794
01:10:58,491 --> 01:11:02,060
whatever you want to call it.
And started fighting MMA and wasn't

1795
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:06,620
telling these women that she used to be
a man for 30 fucking years and I was

1796
01:11:06,621 --> 01:11:07,430
like,
well that's crazy.

1797
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,410
Like if you tell people and they still
want to fight,

1798
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,300
that's fine.
I think you should be able do whatever

1799
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:12,680
you want to do.
Just like I think you should be able to

1800
01:11:12,681 --> 01:11:13,514
ride a bull.

1801
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,330
I,
you know I support your right to ride a

1802
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:16,320
bull.
You want to ride a bull.

1803
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,600
I'm not telling you you shouldn't do it
because I don't,

1804
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,930
where the fuck am I to tell you they
shouldn't jump out of buildings and a

1805
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:26,310
and skydive or jump out of planes rather
or a jump off cliffs with one of those

1806
01:11:26,311 --> 01:11:28,890
wingsuits like my friend Andy does you.
You should.

1807
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,620
You should be able do whatever you want
to do as long as you're informed,

1808
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:35,580
but this idea that it's not something
that you need to tell the other person

1809
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:38,700
about because now you're a woman.
I say that's bullshit.

1810
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:41,370
You're a biologically a man.
You were born a man,

1811
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:42,720
you have an x,
y chromosome.

1812
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:44,490
You have all sorts of mechanical
advantages.

1813
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:47,340
You have different bone structure,
it's not the fucking same.

1814
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:52,680
And if these people want to continue
this crazy narrative that once you

1815
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:54,600
decide that you identify with being a
woman,

1816
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,160
he should be able to compete as a woman.

1817
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:58,020
It's fucking crazy.
I mean,

1818
01:11:58,021 --> 01:11:59,880
I'm sure you saw what happened with that
kid in high school.

1819
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,500
There was a kid in high school.
Yeah.

1820
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:05,490
She,
she wanted to be a boy and so they

1821
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:07,200
started giving her testosterone
treatments,

1822
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:11,220
but she still has to compete as a girl
in wrestling while she's transitioning

1823
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:13,740
to being a boy.
So they giving her these testosterone

1824
01:12:13,741 --> 01:12:15,810
treatments and she's just mauling these
girls.

1825
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,070
Yeah.
It's just not fair.

1826
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,270
What happened to the,
uh,

1827
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,920
the girl,
it's not her fault,

1828
01:12:19,921 --> 01:12:20,670
by the way,
that kid,

1829
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,060
that's the fucking,
the people that live there want her to

1830
01:12:24,061 --> 01:12:26,190
compete as a girl.
And if that's the case,

1831
01:12:26,191 --> 01:12:28,830
you shouldn't allow her to be competing,
wants to taking testosterone.

1832
01:12:28,831 --> 01:12:31,080
It's real simple.
And if she wants to compete as a boy

1833
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:32,040
letter,
compete as a boy,

1834
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,650
or I let him compete as a boy.
In your opinion,

1835
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:36,210
what happened to the young girl?

1836
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:38,820
That was Ronda Rousey.
Yes.

1837
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:42,810
The Olympian girl that you know,
all of a sudden went from the penthouse

1838
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:45,360
to the Shit House.
Lot of things.

1839
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,010
It's a long,
long story.

1840
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,060
I was a big sign over her amazing judo
practitioner,

1841
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:55,920
um,
and dominant like no one else ever in

1842
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:58,950
women's mma up to that point.
It's in the UFC at least.

1843
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:04,370
But there was some holes in her approach
that were exposed by Holly Holm.

1844
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:06,600
The point in the doctor out girl head
kicked her.

1845
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,540
Holly had the perfect style to deal with
Rhonda style.

1846
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,340
She's really strong,
she's fast,

1847
01:13:11,341 --> 01:13:16,050
she's amazing athlete and she is an
outstanding striker and so ron does

1848
01:13:16,051 --> 01:13:18,420
thing was to charge at you like a
fucking bull.

1849
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,550
And Holly just played the Matador,
brilliantly caught her,

1850
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,960
lit her up while she was coming in and
then eventually had kicked her and

1851
01:13:24,961 --> 01:13:27,330
stopped her.
Once you get knocked out like that,

1852
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:29,040
first of all,
she was very,

1853
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,680
very confident while she was the
champion.

1854
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:34,260
And some people would say arrogant.
And because of that,

1855
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:36,300
there's all these people that are
waiting for you to fall.

1856
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:39,330
There's a lot of people out there that
don't have much confidence and when they

1857
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:41,610
see someone who's out there who's got a
lot of confidence,

1858
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,580
it's very compelling.
Like a floyd mayweather or Latin conor

1859
01:13:44,581 --> 01:13:45,460
mcgregor,
their,

1860
01:13:45,461 --> 01:13:47,250
their confidence is incredibly
compelling.

1861
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,720
Like you,
you want to be near them.

1862
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,740
But those people,
when that person loses,

1863
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,870
they're the first ones to attack.
They're like,

1864
01:13:54,871 --> 01:13:56,100
yeah,
you fucking loser.

1865
01:13:56,101 --> 01:13:58,710
I knew you're a loser.
Like you go to Ronda Rousey's a

1866
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:01,260
instagram page and read the comments
under her pictures.

1867
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,740
It's ruthless.
Some fucking assholes.

1868
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:08,010
This assholes.
And I guarantee you all those people are

1869
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:13,011
severely unaccomplished or really young,
either young kids that don't understand

1870
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:14,770
what they're doing.
They just have this opportunity to be

1871
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:17,500
able to talk shit or they're a bunch of
fucking losers.

1872
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:21,790
And they're finding this opportunity to
shit on someone who was this incredible

1873
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,070
bright,
shining star that fizzled out.

1874
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:29,340
So she lost to Holly Holm and then she
came back in a far worst matchup against

1875
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:32,680
Amanda Nunez.
And I thought Nunez before Holly Holm

1876
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:35,460
beat or I thought Nunez was the most
dangerous matchup for cause.

1877
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,770
Amanda Nunez is a Brazilian Jujitsu
black belt and she has heavy,

1878
01:14:38,771 --> 01:14:41,380
heavy hands.
He's a dangerous striker and I was like

1879
01:14:41,381 --> 01:14:43,540
Ron is going to have to close the
distance or to grab her and take her to

1880
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:45,400
the ground.
And when she does it's still fucking

1881
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:48,010
picnic because Amanda Nunez is nasty on
the ground.

1882
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,980
And then getting close to her,
she's got knockout power with her hands.

1883
01:14:50,981 --> 01:14:52,780
I'm like this is a terrible,
terrible matchup.

1884
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:56,020
And it turned out to be right because
she got knocked down 48 seconds and the

1885
01:14:56,021 --> 01:14:59,140
rematch.
But what she should've done is revamp or

1886
01:14:59,141 --> 01:15:04,030
camp or not fight,
revamp re go to one of the masters.

1887
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:08,230
There's a few masters of mixed martial
arts in this world is for Rasa Hobby and

1888
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:12,100
Matt Hume and Duke Roufus is a few of
these striking mixed martial arts

1889
01:15:12,101 --> 01:15:15,460
masters and you have to go to them,
you have to go to them and you have to

1890
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:18,220
like submit yourself and say look,
let's fix this.

1891
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:21,130
Let's fix whatever I'm doing.
And let's see if we can take this to the

1892
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:25,930
next level because the sport evolved and
the sport pastor by like she was at the

1893
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:28,030
very top,
but if you build it,

1894
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:30,100
it's like that field of dreams movie,
you build it,

1895
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:34,690
they will come.
And when she built the women's Bantam

1896
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:37,450
Weight Division and became this dominant
force and stopped all these people and

1897
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,410
looked invincible,
all those women were coming up below her

1898
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:43,420
and they were,
they were getting better and they were

1899
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:46,660
evolving and they were like the rest of
mma,

1900
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:48,940
they were reaching this incredibly high
level.

1901
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:51,940
Where's the women's MMA movement?
And then in the early days,

1902
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:52,601
you know,
three,

1903
01:15:52,601 --> 01:15:54,760
four years ago,
if you watched women's mma,

1904
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:59,200
this skill level was nowhere near
commensurate with the men skill level,

1905
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:02,350
like demand skill level at the three,
four years ago.

1906
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,600
They're better today but only a little
bit better.

1907
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,960
But the women are way better today than
they were because it's a new thing.

1908
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,220
It's like 1997 for mixed martial arts
from men.

1909
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,230
That's what like three or four years ago
it was,

1910
01:16:14,231 --> 01:16:18,100
but now the women have essentially
pretty much caught up or close to it.

1911
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,250
There's very high level striking,
very high level submissions,

1912
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:25,540
very high level fluid overall mixed
martial arts games that you're seeing in

1913
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,690
the women's division and Rhonda in a lot
of ways,

1914
01:16:28,691 --> 01:16:30,010
a spectacular,
she was,

1915
01:16:30,011 --> 01:16:33,100
had a very limited approach.
She didn't kick,

1916
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:36,490
she punched,
but she wasn't necessarily like the most

1917
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:41,290
brutal knockout puncher and she wasn't
necessarily the most skillful boxer.

1918
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:43,210
She didn't really have a tremendous
amount of experience.

1919
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:47,740
What she had was incredible athleticism,
a worldclass mindset.

1920
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,750
She was a world class athlete,
you know,

1921
01:16:49,751 --> 01:16:52,750
she's a former Olympian and outstanding
judo.

1922
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:55,750
Her judo and our arm bars are amongst
the best in the world.

1923
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:59,320
I'm sure it transitions the way she
attacks and attacks and tax and set

1924
01:16:59,321 --> 01:17:02,860
things up.
She's phenomenally talented and you

1925
01:17:02,861 --> 01:17:04,960
know,
really accomplished in judo.

1926
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:09,440
But when you want to be a world mixed
martial arts champion at the highest

1927
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:12,290
level of the game,
now you have to be great at everything.

1928
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:15,590
There's people like Demetrius mighty
mouse Johnson I think is the best

1929
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:17,240
fighter in the world.
He's amazing.

1930
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,280
Yeah,
that guy's great at everything and

1931
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:21,800
that's why he's the best cause you don't
know what the fuck he's going to do.

1932
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:25,010
You don't know if he's going to kick you
or knee you or take you down or strangle

1933
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:25,844
you or,
or,

1934
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:27,270
or elbow you.

1935
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,860
And he's just got so many options and
he's coming at you from all different

1936
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:32,780
directions and he never gets tired.
He's,

1937
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:36,200
he's the total full package.
We don't have a demetrius mighty mouse,

1938
01:17:36,201 --> 01:17:38,870
Johnson and women's mma yet,
but it's common.

1939
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,210
It's common.
And Brian does not that,

1940
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,910
you know,
Rhonda is more like maybe like a

1941
01:17:43,911 --> 01:17:47,690
chocolate dell or one of the early
pioneers of men's mma.

1942
01:17:47,691 --> 01:17:50,300
Super talented,
really fun to watch,

1943
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:54,860
but perhaps limited in their approach.
I used to enjoy,

1944
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:55,940
well,
I enjoy mighty mouse.

1945
01:17:55,941 --> 01:17:57,590
Now that you mentioned you met,
he's incredible.

1946
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,050
He's incredible.
You know,

1947
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,980
there's a,
there's so many of them now.

1948
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:05,020
I mean it's just this sport is just
exploding and it's exploding with towels

1949
01:18:05,021 --> 01:18:07,190
and changed his,
they sold well.

1950
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:09,470
It has a little bit,
it's trying to like refine itself I

1951
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:11,570
think.
But the guys who sold it or the guys who

1952
01:18:11,571 --> 01:18:13,040
bought it rather,
um,

1953
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,210
you know,
they're savvy,

1954
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:17,900
intelligent dudes who are trying to do
it their way and there's going to be

1955
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,040
some bumps along the way.

1956
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,780
There's Ma,
they've made a lot of changes and

1957
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:22,490
they're trying to do some things
differently.

1958
01:18:22,491 --> 01:18:26,000
And some of the things I agree with,
like now I have a three man booth,

1959
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:29,630
like it's me and a fighter and then the
play by play commentator,

1960
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,760
which we've done a couple of times.
So I think is really good.

1961
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,070
I like it.
And I'm there.

1962
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:38,690
They've got a lot of match ups that have
fallen through unfortunately because of

1963
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:40,790
weight cut issues and a bunch of other
stuff.

1964
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:43,730
So it's a tough business man.
I wouldn't want to be a promoter.

1965
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,950
It's a,
what I do is easy.

1966
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,590
I just show up and things are happening.
I talk about the things that are

1967
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:49,820
happening.
It's not a lot,

1968
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,730
you know,
I don't have to do a lot of work to get

1969
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:53,564
there.
You know,

1970
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:57,140
I just kind of get there and then I
watch and I talk about the fights.

1971
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:00,710
That promoting angle of it is
unbelievably brutal.

1972
01:19:00,711 --> 01:19:02,730
You have to rely on so many people to do
their job.

1973
01:19:02,731 --> 01:19:04,190
So many people that have their shit
together,

1974
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:08,480
you've got to rely on these crazy
impulsive maniacs known as MMA fighters.

1975
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:12,050
They get their weight in order and to,
to have their camp go through without

1976
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:15,830
severely injuring themselves and to do
things smartly and intelligently and

1977
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:20,180
conservatively so that they can show up
for the dance and be able to perform at

1978
01:19:20,181 --> 01:19:21,170
their best.
It's,

1979
01:19:21,171 --> 01:19:21,501
you know,
it's,

1980
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:23,870
you're asking a lot of,
a lot of different people and most of

1981
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:25,070
them come through.
You know,

1982
01:19:25,071 --> 01:19:26,720
most fighters are incredibly
professional.

1983
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,820
Uh,
but some of them don't like that.

1984
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:29,680
Habib number,
madoff,

1985
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,900
Tony Ferguson fight that fell through a
couple of weeks ago or last week.

1986
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:35,920
Horrible.
Just devastating that were,

1987
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,410
you know,
we were all ready for that fight.

1988
01:19:37,411 --> 01:19:40,430
And then in the day of the fight,
how he can't make it the day of the

1989
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:41,990
weigh ins,
rather he can't make the weight and they

1990
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,990
send him to the hospital.
So those kinds of things do happen.

1991
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:48,140
These guys that are running it now,
the wme guys,

1992
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,850
you know,
they're smart as hell.

1993
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:51,740
So we'll just see.
They'll figure it out.

1994
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:53,810
That's what I think.
I think they'll,

1995
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,690
he'll take a little while.
It'll be,

1996
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:57,320
there'll be a little bit of trial and
error.

1997
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:59,360
Just understandable.
I mean,

1998
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:02,030
they're going to,
they spent 4 billion on the UFC.

1999
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:03,320
They're going to want it run it their
way.

2000
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:05,990
I get that.
It's incredible investment.

2001
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,860
I don't know how the fuck they're going
to make that money back.

2002
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:09,990
You're a,
you're a smart financial guy.

2003
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,220
How the hell they make that money back?
Oh,

2004
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:15,030
Jesus.
Dan Pena.

2005
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,720
Why didn't you do that?
Is Not likely.

2006
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:19,623
No.
Uh,

2007
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:22,920
the way I would do it is a,
I would take it public.

2008
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:24,420
Oh,
it was that,

2009
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:28,290
I need to know where you heard it here
first on Joe Show,

2010
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:33,590
take it public and they that they can
make 50% on their money in a week.

2011
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:38,520
I mean a week after they take it public
because the uh,

2012
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:42,210
the average investor pays up to much,
they pay up high multiples.

2013
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:46,920
And the difference between a non a
liquid investment and a liquid

2014
01:20:46,921 --> 01:20:49,140
investment,
the multiples are normally 50 to a

2015
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:53,700
hundred percent higher.
Just asked me talk Chinese if he's,

2016
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:56,040
if,
let's just say they bought it at 20

2017
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:57,370
times earnings.
Okay.

2018
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:00,130
Forbidden Equated to 20 times earnings,
right?

2019
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,320
20 Times per annual.
Yeah,

2020
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:03,270
that's correct.

2021
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:04,110
So,
uh,

2022
01:21:04,111 --> 01:21:06,450
they take it public and the,
the investment public,

2023
01:21:06,451 --> 01:21:09,360
the schmucks that buy stocks on the New
York Stock Exchange,

2024
01:21:09,361 --> 01:21:11,150
we'll give you 40 times.
They will.

2025
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:12,990
Yes.
While they do that,

2026
01:21:12,991 --> 01:21:15,780
then well,
what's the problem with taking things

2027
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:19,110
pulling out?
They lose control depending on how much

2028
01:21:19,111 --> 01:21:20,580
of this,
how much of the stock are they going to

2029
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:22,710
sell?
You're going to sell 10%.

2030
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:25,830
They're certainly not gonna sell 50.1%
because then they lose total control.

2031
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:30,570
But then there also have to adhere to
the SEC Securities Exchange Commission.

2032
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:32,820
There's rules,
uh,

2033
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:35,610
and they got to have to have audited
statements every,

2034
01:21:35,611 --> 01:21:37,530
uh,
every 90 days.

2035
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:38,890
And if there's a,
if,

2036
01:21:38,891 --> 01:21:43,020
if they gave you too much money for
expenses and it's down there as a

2037
01:21:43,021 --> 01:21:44,010
footnote,
they're going to come.

2038
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,170
They come and investigate.
Why did you get Rogan that?

2039
01:21:46,171 --> 01:21:49,680
What'd you do that most people don't
want to go public because of that?

2040
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:54,860
I went public because I could see that I
was going to make a thousand times my

2041
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:55,890
money.
I mean,

2042
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:58,770
not even 100,000 times my money.
So it was a no brainer.

2043
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:01,770
We made 100,000 times your money by
going public.

2044
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:02,511
Well,
it,

2045
01:22:02,511 --> 01:22:06,180
what's he actually better than that?
The uh,

2046
01:22:06,181 --> 01:22:08,090
I Jamie,
we to take this podcast Papa.

2047
01:22:08,110 --> 01:22:10,890
Okay.
I grew at 67000% a year.

2048
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:14,880
What the fuck does that even mean?
[inaudible] 67.

2049
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:19,050
My total growth on my original
investment was 55000000%.

2050
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,030
Jesus Christ.
That's a lot of money.

2051
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,610
And that,
there hasn't been facebook nor anybody

2052
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:27,211
else.
Anybody,

2053
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:29,760
even close by it.
Unfortunately for me,

2054
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,340
because it was 25 years ago,
I was at a low bass.

2055
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,910
My Bass was only half a million or five.
Yeah.

2056
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:37,680
Excuse me,
500 million.

2057
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,780
And,
but now,

2058
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,970
I mean,
does that mean by your base?

2059
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,050
In other words,
what,

2060
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:46,830
I grew the company from 800 bucks to 500
million.

2061
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:48,300
Okay.
So,

2062
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:51,240
but my base,
my initial base was eight.

2063
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:52,380
Uh,
call it 1000 bucks.

2064
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:55,740
Okay.
In my exit base was 500 million,

2065
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:59,250
$500 million.
And,

2066
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,600
uh,
of course I had a lot of shareholders.

2067
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,130
It wasn't just me.
Uh,

2068
01:23:02,131 --> 01:23:03,960
but now,
uh,

2069
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:05,040
the,
um,

2070
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,430
the company

2071
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:10,060
grew.
If you take 800 bucks and you figure out

2072
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:11,910
the,
you do a spreadsheet on a,

2073
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:15,520
the growth per year at 67000%,
and if do the total growth,

2074
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:18,700
it's 55000000%.
55000000%.

2075
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,830
Now,
if you were urine MMA fan exam,

2076
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:25,410
give advice to the people that own the
UFC,

2077
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:27,250
what would you tell them?
Alpha brain.

2078
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,640
What would you,
what would you give them?

2079
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:34,210
I hire somebody like Goldman Sachs.
Uh,

2080
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:37,360
I hired more than one.
I take Goldman Sachs and jp Morgan or

2081
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:42,361
somebody like that or credit suisse to,
to look at how to make their investment

2082
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:47,560
liquid liquid.
Cause now it's frozen like a stiff dick.

2083
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:49,960
I mean it's not going into place.
So what does that mean?

2084
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:51,190
Like how do you make it liquid?
Liquid.

2085
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:52,570
Okay.
If,

2086
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,820
let's just say we're going to take this
podcast public.

2087
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,673
Okay.
So let's do it.

2088
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:56,700
Let's go crazy.
Okay,

2089
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:58,090
let's get crazy now.

2090
01:23:58,090 --> 01:23:59,740
Let's just say that the,
um,

2091
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:00,960
right now,
uh,

2092
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:02,500
uh,
you make a,

2093
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,320
let's throw out numbers,
$1 million a year off your podcast.

2094
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,100
Uh,
and um,

2095
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:08,950
you have no other shareholders.
Okay?

2096
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:09,793
Just,
okay,

2097
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,940
now you want to take it public and you
want to take it public on one of the

2098
01:24:12,941 --> 01:24:15,130
secondary tertiary exchanges because,
uh,

2099
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,050
this isn't,
wouldn't be big enough to take on the

2100
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:18,790
New York Stock Exchange.
And,

2101
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:21,220
um,
do you want to sell shares in your baby?

2102
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,820
A $4,000 a share.
Okay.

2103
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,570
How many shares does one half?
Well,

2104
01:24:25,571 --> 01:24:27,320
you,
it has been used one if you want to.

2105
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:30,160
So he can make 100 million shares with
$1,000 a share.

2106
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:30,881
Yeah Buddy.
You,

2107
01:24:30,881 --> 01:24:33,940
you couldn't,
you couldn't equate that much value,

2108
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:36,100
but you could do a thousand chairs at a
thousand,

2109
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:37,770
$1,000 a share.
Oh,

2110
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:38,613
okay.
Okay.

2111
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:43,420
And so you sell 20% off to the public.
So 20% of those shares are,

2112
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,640
and I mean you've got millions of people
that follow you.

2113
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,860
I mean,
that would be a slam dunk.

2114
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,360
I mean,
it'd be a no brainer.

2115
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:51,940
It'd be a no brainer.
Who's done a bunch of people be telling

2116
01:24:51,941 --> 01:24:55,300
me to who I know as long as long as you
got to keep control,

2117
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:56,620
fuck you.
You know,

2118
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:59,310
they would try to get that power though.
They got where they would,

2119
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:03,760
but as long as you held or your group,
your consortium or you and your,

2120
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:07,210
uh,
your buddies held more than 50%,

2121
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:10,270
they could never take control.
But it seems like that's,

2122
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,040
that's where hostile takeovers,
correct.

2123
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:12,874
Right.
Correct.

2124
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:15,580
People gather.
I started there.

2125
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,080
Yeah.
I'm getting excited myself.

2126
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:18,050
Just thinking about it.
Yes,

2127
01:25:18,051 --> 01:25:20,780
I'll take over.
Is that okay?

2128
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,960
Well,
we'll meet in the cage.

2129
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,140
You can put your best guy up.
I'll put my best gun,

2130
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:27,460
then we'll settle it that way.
Just like they do in the old days,

2131
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,710
you know,
instead of the two armies going to war

2132
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,080
the best night from this guy and the
best night from this guy.

2133
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,220
Who would you pick the defense to defend
your honor.

2134
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,610
My arm and the cage.
I mean if you get the other side,

2135
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,410
had a guy,
who would you pick?

2136
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,250
It's a good question.
Are we doing wait clauses?

2137
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:44,831
No.
No.

2138
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:47,860
And anything goes.
This is a heavyweight named Francis and

2139
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,750
Ghana.
I think I might put my money on that

2140
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:50,650
guy.
Yeah.

2141
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,900
Terrifying young heavyweight.
Okay.

2142
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,220
Okay.
Who would they be?

2143
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:55,960
Dead.
Who cares what I'm putting out?

2144
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:59,470
Okay.
I used to be a fan of,

2145
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:00,304
uh,
lesnar.

2146
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:02,260
I liked scary,
scary.

2147
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,010
If Brock got into

2148
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,950
mma when he was young,
if somebody grabbed him like right out

2149
01:26:06,951 --> 01:26:10,160
of college and uh,
and really trained him properly,

2150
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,590
better yet,
right out of high school and train him

2151
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:15,260
properly.
Just unbelievable freak athlete.

2152
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:17,180
A freak athlete.
I remember in the heavy,

2153
01:26:17,181 --> 01:26:17,260
yeah.

2154
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:17,920
Wait,
a match.

2155
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,170
I forget who was fought where,
um,

2156
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:22,600
he,
he had beaten up lesnar pretty bad,

2157
01:26:22,601 --> 01:26:24,640
but less,
there's still win the fight that guy

2158
01:26:24,641 --> 01:26:26,560
with the big hands and other shame
Carwyn yeah,

2159
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:26,990
yeah,
yeah,

2160
01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:27,300
yeah.

2161
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,920
Shane and beat the shit out of in the
first round.

2162
01:26:28,921 --> 01:26:32,190
But he gassed out and then brock
survived and strangled him in a second

2163
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,170
at Brock's a tough guy and you know,
he just was a guy who got into mma very

2164
01:26:37,171 --> 01:26:40,950
late in life and wasn't a natural
striker and really didn't have the,

2165
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:44,160
the natural striking capability.
Not when I say natural,

2166
01:26:44,161 --> 01:26:46,620
I mean like fluid.
Really.

2167
01:26:46,621 --> 01:26:49,170
Um,
effortless striking that you get when

2168
01:26:49,171 --> 01:26:50,910
you've been doing it for years and years
and years.

2169
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,560
That's,
that's one of the hardest things to

2170
01:26:52,561 --> 01:26:55,440
learn as guys get older when they're
like in their thirties.

2171
01:26:55,441 --> 01:26:58,320
And then learning how to strike,
learning how to strike against someone

2172
01:26:58,321 --> 01:27:01,170
who's really seasoned and good.
There's just going to be these openings

2173
01:27:01,171 --> 01:27:03,240
and it just takes a few shots.
One,

2174
01:27:03,241 --> 01:27:03,841
two,
three,

2175
01:27:03,841 --> 01:27:06,480
get in and all of a sudden you're
diminished in the leg kick and then the

2176
01:27:06,481 --> 01:27:08,100
fucking shot to the body and you're
hurt.

2177
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,110
And then boom,
you saw what happened when he fought

2178
01:27:10,111 --> 01:27:12,000
Cain Velasquez.
Cain just overwhelmed them.

2179
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,790
It just so much better with striking and
really grit,

2180
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,700
great at wrestling as well.
So cain was able to get back up on its

2181
01:27:17,701 --> 01:27:20,070
feet when brock took them down and then
just brought,

2182
01:27:20,071 --> 01:27:22,380
could not handle the onslaught that
came,

2183
01:27:22,381 --> 01:27:26,490
was putting on him on the feet.
Just wasn't prepared for it correctly.

2184
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:30,540
You need years and years and years of
striking training and you need to spar

2185
01:27:30,541 --> 01:27:32,300
lightly and you need to,
you know,

2186
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,520
you need to develop fluidity and you in
your movements,

2187
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,190
you need to have efficient striking
mood.

2188
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:38,810
Now what's it called?
The,

2189
01:27:38,811 --> 01:27:39,351
uh,
the,

2190
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:40,101
uh,
the,

2191
01:27:40,101 --> 01:27:42,080
the pretend wrestling league.
Uh,

2192
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:43,430
pro wrestling.
Wwe.

2193
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,330
Yeah.
Okay.

2194
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,370
Yeah.
You know,

2195
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:46,370
uh,
what's the guy's name?

2196
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:48,050
The founder,
Vince Mcmahon.

2197
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,880
I'm a man and his wife is now in the,
in the cabinet,

2198
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,753
uh,
for trump.

2199
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:53,210
And she got approved.
Hilarious.

2200
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:55,400
Yes.
Holly is hilarious.

2201
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:59,780
But she or not she,
they got rich when they went public.

2202
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

2203
01:28:02,451 --> 01:28:04,700
See they went public.
They went public with the wwe.

2204
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:09,710
Correct.
And I was offered for $50,000 a point

2205
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:12,200
when they first got started,
a bunch of buddies of mine in

2206
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:14,720
Connecticut,
we're riding in a limo and they show me

2207
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:17,870
a demo tape and he says,
we can get into this weekend by up to

2208
01:28:17,871 --> 01:28:21,200
10% for $50,000 a point.
They need money.

2209
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:22,320
I said,
well shit.

2210
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,270
Who's going to watch that shit?

2211
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:28,090
Nah,
I feel that same way my friend Tony was

2212
01:28:28,091 --> 01:28:28,924
at,
um,

2213
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:30,970
I don't know what they call it.
Monday night raw.

2214
01:28:30,971 --> 01:28:34,480
Is that what it was at the staple center
and he was making videos while he was in

2215
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:35,590
the audience.
And I was like,

2216
01:28:35,591 --> 01:28:38,560
you gotta be fucking shitting me.
There's 20,000 people in this place.

2217
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,410
It's crazy.
The numbers are insane.

2218
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,100
People love that stuff.
They love it.

2219
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:46,780
I can't buy these.
I don't understand it.

2220
01:28:46,781 --> 01:28:47,740
Yeah.
But I mean that,

2221
01:28:47,741 --> 01:28:48,430
that,
that's,

2222
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:52,090
he got liquid by going public.
How many people do you think that pay

2223
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:57,360
$3,000 a month to that guy wound up
going to pro pro wrestling and the same

2224
01:28:58,661 --> 01:29:01,440
people?
Probably the $3,000 yeah,

2225
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:02,040
probably the same

2226
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,780
people.
That's probably like 100% of them are

2227
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:05,550
pro wrestling fans.
Yeah.

2228
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,280
Now does everybody know po pro wrestling
is not for real?

2229
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,440
No.
No.

2230
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:12,840
There's some people who have had
injuries out there that says there's a

2231
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:15,120
few,
few people that fell off the back of a

2232
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:18,460
motorcycle and the little girl booby
wound,

2233
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:23,740
well it's all on Prague was number one.
This is soon when they come down they

2234
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:29,730
the the the runway amp and the fire and
this and that.

2235
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,100
And then when they get,
they have to be good,

2236
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:33,160
good athletes,
boom.

2237
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:36,330
When they bounce their heads and some of
those things you hit him with chairs

2238
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:37,380
does.
Definitely good athletes.

2239
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,333
Yeah.

2240
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:42,100
Does the guys are outstanding athletes
and it's a fucking really hard way to

2241
01:29:42,101 --> 01:29:44,440
make a living.
I mean w whatever it say,

2242
01:29:44,441 --> 01:29:46,810
whatever the fuck you want about it
being choreographed.

2243
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:50,350
They're still picking each other up and
slamming each other on the ground.

2244
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:53,560
And hitting each other and it's got to
hurt after a few weeks,

2245
01:29:53,561 --> 01:29:54,430
few months,
few years,

2246
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:56,710
not only down.
Those guys are on the road,

2247
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:59,530
you know,
200 plus days a year doing that.

2248
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:03,760
So it is a absolutely brutal business.
It's a hard way to make a living and

2249
01:30:03,761 --> 01:30:05,350
they are tough,
tough guys.

2250
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:08,650
So they might not be really competing
like an MMA fighter is,

2251
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,080
but there's no doubt about it.
They have my respect.

2252
01:30:11,081 --> 01:30:13,990
Those guys are tough.
That's a tough way to make a living.

2253
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:17,530
They are earning their money and I think
they're doing it in a way where most

2254
01:30:17,531 --> 01:30:19,180
people don't even see them earn their
money.

2255
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,550
They mean they're out in these,
these arenas.

2256
01:30:21,551 --> 01:30:21,911
You know,
they're,

2257
01:30:21,911 --> 01:30:24,760
they're playing this state and that
state and they're going on the road and

2258
01:30:24,761 --> 01:30:27,670
they're slamming each other and throwing
each other into the turnbuckle and

2259
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:30,700
elbowing each other in the face.
It's fucking hard,

2260
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:33,310
man.
That is a hard way to make a living.

2261
01:30:33,311 --> 01:30:37,690
And a giant percentage of those guys
wind up having problems with pain pills,

2262
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:41,170
severe pain and their body always
constantly,

2263
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,400
you know,
back injuries,

2264
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:43,900
knee injuries,
neck injuries,

2265
01:30:43,901 --> 01:30:44,740
elbow injuries,
me,

2266
01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:47,830
it's just,
it's a fucking brutal way to get paid.

2267
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:51,310
Now are the a mea guys getting paid big
money now?

2268
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:55,660
The best of the best are the guys like
conor Mcgregor and conor mcgregor.

2269
01:30:55,661 --> 01:30:57,130
A lot of the people that fight conor
Mcgregor,

2270
01:30:57,131 --> 01:30:58,600
they're making millions.
Ronda Rousey,

2271
01:30:58,601 --> 01:31:00,520
she's making millions.
It's just,

2272
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:03,940
uh,
it's taken a while for the people that

2273
01:31:03,941 --> 01:31:07,810
are not known very well to be able to
make that kind of money.

2274
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:08,770
You know,
they're not,

2275
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:10,180
they're not really,
you know,

2276
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:12,880
it's,
it's hard for the average journeyman

2277
01:31:12,881 --> 01:31:16,450
fighter to not just pay their bills,
but to put money away as well.

2278
01:31:16,451 --> 01:31:17,284
You know,
it's just,

2279
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,350
but it's like that in boxing too.
This is what people don't understand.

2280
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:21,850
Boxing like you,
people say,

2281
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,770
well,
floyd mayweather made $40 million for

2282
01:31:23,771 --> 01:31:25,420
that fight.
Maybe he did,

2283
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:28,360
but floyd mayweather's one,
there's one floyd mayweather.

2284
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:32,200
Gennady Golovkin can't sell 200,000
paper view bys.

2285
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:34,540
And he's the one of the best fighters in
the world today.

2286
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:36,940
You know,
Vassily Limit Chanko same thing.

2287
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:38,530
One of the best fighters in the world
today.

2288
01:31:38,531 --> 01:31:40,660
He's not making the kind of money to
conor Mcgregor's making.

2289
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:44,920
So what boxing is,
is like you see these very big marquee

2290
01:31:44,921 --> 01:31:45,940
names,
you know,

2291
01:31:45,941 --> 01:31:49,930
these big famous guys who are making
good money and um,

2292
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:52,420
they make more money than the best UFC
guys.

2293
01:31:52,421 --> 01:31:55,510
Like Manny Pacquiao has made more money
than the best UFC guys.

2294
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:57,850
But conor mcgregor is nipping at their
heels right now.

2295
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,190
Yeah,
man.

2296
01:31:59,190 --> 01:32:00,040
He used to have a

2297
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,550
house right around the corner from me.
I lived eight years in Manila,

2298
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,740
one year in China.
Thriller in Manila.

2299
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,640
Yeah.
Wow.

2300
01:32:06,641 --> 01:32:08,830
What does that like,
if you've got money,

2301
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:11,110
it's terrific.
Is it dangerous?

2302
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:11,771
Yeah.
My,

2303
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:14,320
my wife had six bodyguards,
Jesus Christ,

2304
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:16,000
six,
six and one of them used to be the

2305
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:20,260
bodyguard to the president and the a all
I want you there.

2306
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:22,540
Why live in there?
I had a thriving business.

2307
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,570
I still have the thrive in business and
we don't live there anymore.

2308
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,780
Play Pool.
Yeah.

2309
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:26,710
Yeah,
yeah.

2310
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:28,870
I know you did.
If you live in Manila,

2311
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:32,530
you gotta play some pool and a while.
We live in a year in China,

2312
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:35,730
eight years.
There are three years in India and um,

2313
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:36,490
the,
uh,

2314
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:38,920
but when I was interviewing bodyguards,
I just want to know,

2315
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:42,010
have you ever gotten any trigger time?
I don't want you to just looking pretty,

2316
01:32:42,011 --> 01:32:43,450
I mean did you ever pulled the fucking
trigger?

2317
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,950
So all the are all of my wife's body
guards had pulled triggers before,

2318
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:49,200
you know,
because you could get,

2319
01:32:49,201 --> 01:32:53,040
get these guys I've read the same with
CIA or the secret shoppers.

2320
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:55,120
I mean have you done anything,
you know,

2321
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,820
well that's it.
That is an important thing and it's a,

2322
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:01,330
some would consider maybe like there's
some people that are more sensitive that

2323
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:03,190
will say,
well that's distasteful thing to even

2324
01:33:03,191 --> 01:33:04,900
bring up.
Like why is their honor and shooting

2325
01:33:04,901 --> 01:33:06,450
people while I was there on a tray or
12.

2326
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:10,510
But I think what you were trying to
figure out when you went into this big

2327
01:33:10,511 --> 01:33:12,700
game hunting with handguns thing,
whether or not you,

2328
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:16,930
you would pussy out when the moment was
there is because you knew that it's a

2329
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:20,200
significant challenge when your life is
legitimately on the line.

2330
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:23,890
People Act different when they think
they're going to die.

2331
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:25,870
I mean,
they just do.

2332
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,750
They just do that just to find out who
you really are versus who you're

2333
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:30,040
pretending that you are holy.
You know?

2334
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:34,020
And I know a lot of brave guys that have
piss their pants course themselves,

2335
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:36,590
but they,
they did with it was necessary.

2336
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:39,190
But that,
that moment of truth.

2337
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:44,670
Well that's the old saying that a great
man and a weak man have the same fear.

2338
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:48,000
Just one response to it a different way.
Yeah.

2339
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,440
I raised my kid does not what happens to
you in life,

2340
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:52,450
it's how you react to what happens to
you in life.

2341
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,660
And the um,
and the,

2342
01:33:55,661 --> 01:34:00,661
the millennial kids are buzzies weenies
they wouldn't even call them vagina

2343
01:34:00,971 --> 01:34:02,470
brains.
Oh yeah.

2344
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:03,940
What was that?
They wanted to get laid.

2345
01:34:03,941 --> 01:34:07,820
They don't know how though.
But isn't a vagina good thing or not?

2346
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:11,530
If you've got one is the brain,
do you realize jellyfish lasted 350

2347
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:12,400
million years without a brain?

2348
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:13,540
Yeah,
but they don't have google.

2349
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:16,660
You can't find them on snapchat.
Who gives a fuck about jellyfish?

2350
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,220
Sting you.
They're assholes.

2351
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:18,900
Yeah.
What are they?

2352
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,410
You can't even eat him.
No,

2353
01:34:20,411 --> 01:34:22,450
you can't.
You can't even eat jellyfish.

2354
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,160
No,
I'm useless.

2355
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,130
The pardon?
What do they do?

2356
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:31,720
What's good is do they just throw it
around in a string of the fish to kill

2357
01:34:31,721 --> 01:34:33,100
them assholes.
Yeah.

2358
01:34:33,101 --> 01:34:35,050
And they fuck with you and you're at the
beach.

2359
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:37,150
Yeah.
And there's some weird fucking super

2360
01:34:37,151 --> 01:34:41,650
ancient life form correctly in years
past to people.

2361
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:44,830
Hopefully we move past,
hopefully,

2362
01:34:44,831 --> 01:34:47,110
you know,
but they know global warming to joke to

2363
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:48,570
the jellyfish to,
yeah.

2364
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:51,190
Oh,
well this is a thing.

2365
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:53,830
I've had this conversation with people
before because you know,

2366
01:34:53,831 --> 01:34:56,740
if you have anybody on a podcast that
is,

2367
01:34:56,741 --> 01:34:58,640
uh,
the saying anything controversial,

2368
01:34:58,641 --> 01:35:00,500
like you're saying about global warming,
people go,

2369
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:02,570
oh my God,
can't believe you had a climate change

2370
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:05,230
denier on your show,
but you're not a climate change denier,

2371
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:08,870
which you're saying is that it's an
exaggerated effect that human beings

2372
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:09,260
have had.

2373
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,480
And regardless of whether or not we had
that effect at all,

2374
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:13,580
if you look at like the end of the Ice
Age,

2375
01:35:13,581 --> 01:35:17,780
you look at all these different
monumental changes in the temperature of

2376
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:19,950
the United States versus the temperature
of the world,

2377
01:35:19,951 --> 01:35:22,700
the global globally.
It's constantly changing.

2378
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:25,400
Yeah.
55,000 years ago at the South Pole,

2379
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:29,180
South Pole,
it was two degrees Celsius warmer.

2380
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,570
And my wife and I've also been to the
magnetic North Pole.

2381
01:35:32,571 --> 01:35:36,060
We were married there as well.
We're bipolar in the south.

2382
01:35:36,061 --> 01:35:37,610
And why did you get married in weird
spots?

2383
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:39,890
Um,
for fun.

2384
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:40,753
Yeah,
for fun,

2385
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,820
crazy life.
And I renewed our vows six times.

2386
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:45,800
Jesus Christ.
He must really love that lady.

2387
01:35:45,801 --> 01:35:46,490
Well,
I do.

2388
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:47,360
I do.
I do.

2389
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,020
And,
uh,

2390
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:49,660
but the North Pole is,
um,

2391
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:50,900
uh,
they,

2392
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:54,350
they all look pretty much the same,
but most people don't realize the South

2393
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:56,510
Pole on a mountain.
So you're at altitude,

2394
01:35:56,511 --> 01:35:58,640
you're at between 10 and 14,000 feet.

2395
01:35:59,150 --> 01:35:59,870
Uh,
so,

2396
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:00,980
uh,
well countries,

2397
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:04,850
the South Pole in Antarctica,
Antarctica is the South Pole is the

2398
01:36:04,851 --> 01:36:06,020
mountain.
And what's the North Pole?

2399
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:07,450
North Pole.
Just movie.

2400
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:08,690
Nice.
Just moving on.

2401
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:13,691
So there's no actual mass on the eyes
and only three to six weeks a year.

2402
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,870
Can you actually have a facility to be
able to land the chopper,

2403
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:20,300
uh,
and have a ceremony at the North Pole?

2404
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,880
Is that a normal thing where people get
a ceremony on the oh no.

2405
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:28,430
Sally and I are at right now the
Guinness Book of Records is going

2406
01:36:28,431 --> 01:36:31,400
through the witnesses or the only two
people that need to be married on both

2407
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:35,030
poles.
You didn't realize the Guinness Book of

2408
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,920
record,
their scam,

2409
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:37,910
they charge you money.
How much?

2410
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:40,370
Well,
to get on the preferred list,

2411
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:44,190
a thousand pounds,
dollars.

2412
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:46,910
It's like 1400 bucks.
1300 bucks.

2413
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:49,910
Most people don't pay it and most people
don't get in.

2414
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:52,400
So you have to pay money to get on their
stupid book.

2415
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:54,230
Correct.
So even if you did something like,

2416
01:36:54,231 --> 01:36:57,890
say if you jump rope for three days
straight and you made the Guinness Book

2417
01:36:57,890 --> 01:36:59,210
of World Records,
you'd have to pay to get in that six,

2418
01:36:59,211 --> 01:37:01,880
seven years to get on what?
Yeah.

2419
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:04,580
Why?
Because that's their model.

2420
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:07,710
Their money.
What a bunch of fucking,

2421
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:12,320
this is probably the first time that
anybody's ever told anybody on a public,

2422
01:37:12,321 --> 01:37:13,670
uh,
medium.

2423
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,620
We've had like four first on this
podcast.

2424
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:17,030
I'm pretty proud of that.
You and me.

2425
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:20,320
Yeah,
we've had right Devon,

2426
01:37:20,321 --> 01:37:21,710
he said,
you said quite a few firsts,

2427
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,300
Alan saying another one.
Okay.

2428
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:26,450
My Pa,
my pet project right now is,

2429
01:37:26,451 --> 01:37:31,451
I'm trying to put together a vet veteran
program and a that I'm funding.

2430
01:37:32,031 --> 01:37:33,560
I put up all the money.
I don't want anybody's money.

2431
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,240
But so,
so far,

2432
01:37:35,241 --> 01:37:40,241
even though I had one of the world's
largest talent agencies and I had 'em 10

2433
01:37:41,751 --> 01:37:46,550
of the top 15 production companies say
that vets don't make good tv.

2434
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,320
Now they won't say that in public.
What do they mean by Vet Stone?

2435
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:53,660
Veteran TV veterans don't make good tv
unless they're rattling around in the

2436
01:37:53,661 --> 01:37:55,350
mud.
Well,

2437
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:59,820
that's what I've been told by some names
that you probably know even.

2438
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:01,710
And,
uh,

2439
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:02,640
the,
um,

2440
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,540
I've been told by four star generals
names that positively everybody on this

2441
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:07,374
podcast with,
no,

2442
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:10,140
I've been told by congressmen,
senators,

2443
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:12,990
I've been told by TV personalities.
Dot.

2444
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:14,440
Moving heads on,
you know,

2445
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:19,670
that all come out for vets except when
they're asked to do something and we

2446
01:38:21,481 --> 01:38:22,410
don't,
I don't want their money.

2447
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,180
So what kind of stuff are you talking
about?

2448
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:25,660
Like do something,
okay.

2449
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:26,490
No,
I mean,

2450
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,920
will you be in an advisory board saying
that,

2451
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,260
uh,
putting bets in business after they

2452
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:32,820
tried,
they tried to transition from the

2453
01:38:32,821 --> 01:38:37,821
military to a civilian life and try to
reduce the 22 veterans,

2454
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,580
commit suicide a day,
you know,

2455
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:43,070
uh,
and um,

2456
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,740
then when on CBS to say,
yeah,

2457
01:38:45,741 --> 01:38:46,051
yeah,
yeah.

2458
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:47,550
But when you ask them to do something,
they're,

2459
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:48,211
they're,
they're,

2460
01:38:48,211 --> 01:38:49,380
they're not as,
um,

2461
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,090
uh,
generous with her time.

2462
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:52,590
And,
uh,

2463
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:54,070
I can understand,
uh,

2464
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,060
if I was asking them for money,
but what I found out,

2465
01:38:57,061 --> 01:39:01,080
Joe,
all these guys save a few stomach need

2466
01:39:01,081 --> 01:39:01,914
to make a living

2467
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,000
and they're not going to get paid for
this.

2468
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:08,870
So they have less time,
pro bono time and charity time.

2469
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,020
Then they let people on when they're in
a,

2470
01:39:12,021 --> 01:39:14,000
on CNBC,
etc. Right.

2471
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:14,960
I see what you're saying.
Okay.

2472
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:17,930
So I've been asked to do a documentary
expos.

2473
01:39:17,931 --> 01:39:21,420
A
I've been asked that I haven't said I

2474
01:39:21,421 --> 01:39:23,520
was going to do it cause I don't really
need that kind of publicity.

2475
01:39:23,850 --> 01:39:27,660
But um,
about this show that I've been trying to

2476
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:28,790
do,
I don't know.

2477
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,060
What is the show?
What's it called?

2478
01:39:30,061 --> 01:39:32,040
Boots to suits.
Boots to suits.

2479
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:34,590
Okay.
So taking them from the military and

2480
01:39:34,591 --> 01:39:39,591
then teaching them how to has five pilot
programs at the castle where I do my

2481
01:39:40,081 --> 01:39:42,140
seminars and with Vats,
uh,

2482
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,890
sometimes we make gum a castle.

2483
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:44,780
Okay.

2484
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:48,070
You're saying when you say that the
castle is that I'm not going to come

2485
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:48,501
back.
Yeah,

2486
01:39:48,501 --> 01:39:50,470
I live in a 14th century.
Storybook cancelled.

2487
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,890
Get the fuck Outta here.
Where is it?

2488
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:53,213
Oh,
stop me.

2489
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,890
You live in Scotland?
Yeah.

2490
01:39:54,891 --> 01:39:56,270
Yeah,
near Saint Andrews.

2491
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:57,650
Jeez.
Why do you live in Scotland?

2492
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:58,790
You all over the place,
man,

2493
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:01,640
because I want them to be,
I wanted to be near the home of golf

2494
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,760
when I were tried.
I tried to retire in my thirties when I

2495
01:40:04,761 --> 01:40:06,500
made uh,
and just play golf.

2496
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,630
Yeah.
But I only lasted a couple of months.

2497
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:10,210
Retirement.
Didn't know.

2498
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:11,780
No,
I mean you don't seem like a guy that

2499
01:40:11,781 --> 01:40:13,430
can be done now.
It didn't suit me.

2500
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:14,653
It,
um,

2501
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:19,590
it doesn't suit me now.
I haven't had to work for 37 years now.

2502
01:40:19,591 --> 01:40:21,260
How did you get involved in all this
online stuff?

2503
01:40:21,261 --> 01:40:24,020
Cause that's how I found out about you
and I found out about you through Sam's

2504
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:24,923
a girl.

2505
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:26,131
I mean,
I,

2506
01:40:26,131 --> 01:40:29,390
I got involved online because I owned
businesses that mark it online.

2507
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:32,150
But you,
you're a great online advice guy.

2508
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:32,840
Yeah.
Oh No,

2509
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:35,510
no.
I mean a five of the top online.

2510
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:39,950
Many producers on the planet.
I trained like who are the top five

2511
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:40,501
guys?
Well,

2512
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:44,330
I'm Matt Lloyd.
Um,

2513
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:47,090
Shakir Hussein.
I feel like this is like he's telling me

2514
01:40:47,091 --> 01:40:49,010
about all stars in a sport.
I don't fall.

2515
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:50,480
Ah,
pat copious,

2516
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:52,760
uh,
uh,

2517
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:56,130
Shakir pattern or was dude's no,
no.

2518
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:59,740
Yeah.
These guys make three to 7 million a

2519
01:40:59,741 --> 01:41:00,670
month.
Jesus,

2520
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,270
that's a lot of money.
I hope you're paying taxes.

2521
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,020
Boys pay that tax.
You,

2522
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:10,090
I know one of them for sure believes in
no taxation without representation.

2523
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:11,440
Oh,
one of those guys,

2524
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:12,260
Huh?
Yeah.

2525
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:13,093
I,
in fact,

2526
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:15,250
almost all of them are that willing.
Yeah.

2527
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:17,200
Yeah,
yeah.

2528
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:18,990
So when I trained them,
but I didn't train her,

2529
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:21,190
you know,
I know about impressions and trap.

2530
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:25,600
I don't understand all that.
But when Google changed their algorithms

2531
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:26,650
10,
12 years ago,

2532
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:32,530
they used to want a hundred guys that
produced 100 million online.

2533
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:38,140
Now they want 10 million guys that
produce 10,000 online.

2534
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:39,083
Ah,

2535
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:40,590
yeah.

2536
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:42,510
And so that's how they built their
platform.

2537
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:45,510
And uh,
and Google is,

2538
01:41:45,511 --> 01:41:49,080
I is a great tool,
but a better tool in my judgment for

2539
01:41:49,081 --> 01:41:52,020
what I do is linkedin.
Yeah.

2540
01:41:52,021 --> 01:41:54,480
Linkedin is some shit that people from
high school we send me.

2541
01:41:54,481 --> 01:41:56,610
I want to pitch them on joining linkedin
page.

2542
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:57,960
Huh?
Are you on Linkedin?

2543
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,090
No.
No,

2544
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:01,250
but I get like invitations.
Oh yeah.

2545
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:04,740
Join linkedin more than anything I ever
get an online.

2546
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:06,780
Okay.
And I don't join.

2547
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:07,921
Well,
I mean,

2548
01:42:07,921 --> 01:42:09,990
linkedin is a,
is is a professional thing.

2549
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:11,340
I know.
That's why it's ridiculous.

2550
01:42:11,341 --> 01:42:12,870
Yeah.
They sending that crap to me.

2551
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:14,640
Um,
but your professional,

2552
01:42:14,641 --> 01:42:16,180
even though you pretend not to be,
oh,

2553
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:17,610
I pretend.
Yes.

2554
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:18,870
Hmm.
Interesting.

2555
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:21,510
Does that your perception tending not to
people?

2556
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:23,880
It's true.
That's your shtick.

2557
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:28,260
My shtick is that I pretended not your
shtick is you pretend to be outside the

2558
01:42:28,261 --> 01:42:30,840
box.
When I believe that you're more inside

2559
01:42:30,841 --> 01:42:32,250
the box,
then these,

2560
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:36,730
these melon heads listening know or
realize we're like,

2561
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:38,640
what do you mean by in the box?
I mean,

2562
01:42:38,641 --> 01:42:39,930
you're a,
you have some,

2563
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:42,810
I know you're a libertarian.
If my research is correct,

2564
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:43,770
pretty much.
Okay.

2565
01:42:43,771 --> 01:42:45,260
And I realized,
uh,

2566
01:42:45,470 --> 01:42:45,961
but you,
I mean,

2567
01:42:45,961 --> 01:42:49,140
you believe in some real Downer of
values,

2568
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:50,401
uh,
that,

2569
01:42:50,401 --> 01:42:53,220
um,
are actually in the box that made

2570
01:42:53,221 --> 01:42:54,054
America great.

2571
01:42:57,930 --> 01:42:58,980
Would you disagree?
Uh,

2572
01:42:58,981 --> 01:43:00,930
yeah,
probably define those.

2573
01:43:00,931 --> 01:43:01,764
Like,
what do you mean?

2574
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:04,470
Uh,
you've talked about,

2575
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,750
we've talked briefly about,
um,

2576
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,390
commitment,
focus,

2577
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:12,040
hard work discipline.
Yeah.

2578
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:12,891
Yeah.
For sure.

2579
01:43:12,891 --> 01:43:15,240
I made this country great.
Well that's what makes people great.

2580
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:15,991
Well,
okay,

2581
01:43:15,991 --> 01:43:18,540
well people make a country.
Comfort is not what makes people great.

2582
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,800
No.
And uh,

2583
01:43:19,801 --> 01:43:20,310
the,
uh,

2584
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:23,160
getting out of your comfort zone is the
reason that millennials have such a hard

2585
01:43:23,161 --> 01:43:23,911
time now.
Yeah.

2586
01:43:23,911 --> 01:43:26,880
They're all sitting on the couch playing
video games and Fox still limited food

2587
01:43:26,881 --> 01:43:28,680
delivered 34 years old.
That's true.

2588
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:29,990
I can't believe that.
Yeah.

2589
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,460
When I was 18,
I couldn't get out of the house quick

2590
01:43:32,461 --> 01:43:35,070
enough.
But don't you think that that's sort of

2591
01:43:35,071 --> 01:43:37,770
like what we always expect from the fall
of civilizations?

2592
01:43:37,771 --> 01:43:39,210
I mean,
that's what we always were taught about

2593
01:43:39,211 --> 01:43:39,811
Rome,
right.

2594
01:43:39,811 --> 01:43:42,930
That Rome got to be incredibly
gluttonous and then it all collapsed the

2595
01:43:42,931 --> 01:43:44,540
way it's on bullshit.
Yeah.

2596
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:45,740
And that's,
that's kind of like,

2597
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:49,740
you don't think that's going to happen
to the u s or it's America right now?

2598
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,500
Absolutely.
I couldn't more.

2599
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,510
But do you think it'd be,
can be changed?

2600
01:43:53,511 --> 01:43:54,860
Can it be turned around?
Can Be changed.

2601
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:57,010
If we want to do it bad enough,
we're willing to pay the price to

2602
01:43:57,020 --> 01:43:58,940
action.
It's going to be painful.

2603
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:01,270
Well,
I think people just need to understand

2604
01:44:01,271 --> 01:44:04,450
that there's consequences.
There's consequences that you pay to

2605
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:09,070
constantly seeking comfort and avoiding
discomfort and avoiding hard work.

2606
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:11,710
And those consequences are you never
going to feel self realized.

2607
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:13,780
He never going to feel like you
accomplished anything.

2608
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,640
He never going to have this feeling of
understanding that difficulty and

2609
01:44:18,641 --> 01:44:21,550
struggle and,
and the ability to push through that is

2610
01:44:21,551 --> 01:44:24,340
a muscle.
And you develop that muscle by doing it.

2611
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:26,770
And once you do,
you develop a lot of self satisfaction

2612
01:44:26,771 --> 01:44:30,610
and you develop peace of mind and you,
you understand that you can overcome

2613
01:44:30,611 --> 01:44:33,010
obstacles if you don't have to overcome
obstacles.

2614
01:44:33,011 --> 01:44:35,500
You never know whether or not you can,
like what you were talking about with

2615
01:44:35,501 --> 01:44:38,200
trigger time,
unless you were faced with actual

2616
01:44:38,201 --> 01:44:40,150
adversity.
You don't understand how you're going to

2617
01:44:40,151 --> 01:44:43,240
feel and how you're gonna react when you
overcome that adversity.

2618
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:43,890
The,
um,

2619
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:46,270
uh,
one of the things I believe that I'm the

2620
01:44:46,271 --> 01:44:49,630
best on the planet in doing is I get you
to do,

2621
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:52,810
which you don't want to do to be what
you want to be.

2622
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:53,830
What do you,
what do I need to do?

2623
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:54,611
Tell me.
Well,

2624
01:44:54,611 --> 01:44:55,330
I don't know.
I don't,

2625
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:56,680
you know,
that's the first time I ever met you.

2626
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:57,611
You know,
you're,

2627
01:44:57,611 --> 01:44:59,770
you're an enigma inside a,
what's that saying?

2628
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:02,800
Wrapped and secrets or track,
something like that.

2629
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:03,910
And,
and,

2630
01:45:03,911 --> 01:45:04,451
uh,
the,

2631
01:45:04,451 --> 01:45:05,950
um,
but so,

2632
01:45:05,951 --> 01:45:08,010
I mean,
hopefully this isn't the last time I

2633
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:09,880
ever talked to you,
but I mean your,

2634
01:45:09,881 --> 01:45:11,260
um,
your,

2635
01:45:11,261 --> 01:45:13,600
um,
you're an idol to,

2636
01:45:13,601 --> 01:45:15,280
you know,
as several million people,

2637
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:18,130
those people need help.
I'm the wrong guy.

2638
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,470
Yeah.
Well keep moving.

2639
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:23,210
These are not the droids you're looking
for.

2640
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:24,730
And,
uh,

2641
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:25,683
but,
um,

2642
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:29,350
what,
what I do and before they put dirt on me

2643
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:33,010
in 50 more years is I want to minimize
people's regrets.

2644
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,590
Okay.
And because we all have regrets.

2645
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,710
Uh,
and I told you what my three regrets or

2646
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:43,400
a earlier in your program here,
but I mean the minimize regrets and uh,

2647
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:45,160
the millennials,
uh,

2648
01:45:45,161 --> 01:45:47,920
we'll have a different sort of regrets.
Uh,

2649
01:45:47,921 --> 01:45:48,431
the,
uh,

2650
01:45:48,431 --> 01:45:49,540
right now,
um,

2651
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:52,570
for the past seven or eight years we've
had free money.

2652
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:56,230
Interest rates had been free.
It's literally free a hundred years from

2653
01:45:56,230 --> 01:45:56,831
now.
They're going to say,

2654
01:45:56,831 --> 01:45:59,170
what the fuck were you doing when they
were giving away free money?

2655
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:01,960
I mean,
literally the people that are listening

2656
01:46:01,961 --> 01:46:05,420
to this 20 years from now,
their children and grandchildren are

2657
01:46:05,421 --> 01:46:06,670
going to say,
grandma,

2658
01:46:06,671 --> 01:46:08,590
Grandpa,
what the fuck were you doing other than

2659
01:46:08,591 --> 01:46:11,770
having your thumb up your ass during the
period of free money?

2660
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:13,270
No.
When you say interest rates are free,

2661
01:46:13,271 --> 01:46:15,310
you talking about business loans,
correct?

2662
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:16,803
I mean,
you can,

2663
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:19,000
it's never going to get,
well,

2664
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:20,860
it can only go up from here.

2665
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:21,910
And,
and uh,

2666
01:46:21,970 --> 01:46:24,700
yellen,
the head of the Fed Federal Reserve has

2667
01:46:24,701 --> 01:46:27,100
already up to him once and they,
she says,

2668
01:46:27,101 --> 01:46:28,690
I guess she's going to have a couple
more times,

2669
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,910
but historically interest,
which tried to be eight,

2670
01:46:30,911 --> 01:46:31,744
10,
12,

2671
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:33,220
not two,
three.

2672
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:37,540
If you can't make a business proposition
work at two or 3% interest.

2673
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:42,190
So you pay one or two points over that
which is the vigorous or the interest

2674
01:46:42,191 --> 01:46:45,940
that they get you out to swallow.
And I'm only mean this metaphorically

2675
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:48,190
kids.
You ought to swallow a fucking revolver.

2676
01:46:49,730 --> 01:46:52,890
Wow.
Let's try again because now if you can't

2677
01:46:52,891 --> 01:46:54,930
make money now,
you ought to jump in front of a bus.

2678
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:59,430
Now when you go and do these seminars,
like finally give him at the council.

2679
01:46:59,431 --> 01:47:01,020
I don't give seminars around the world
anymore.

2680
01:47:01,021 --> 01:47:03,990
I stopped that in 2000 and uh,
to when the,

2681
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:07,050
the century change.
But you just did this speech or speech,

2682
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:12,630
I'm just to,
I guess they'd call it a solid that the

2683
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:13,100
right word.

2684
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,370
Solid.
You're doing a solid,

2685
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:15,060
yeah.
Is that,

2686
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:16,410
does that favor?
Yeah.

2687
01:47:16,411 --> 01:47:17,760
Okay.
I'm doing a favor for the guy,

2688
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:20,520
but so the seminars are only at the
castle,

2689
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:22,380
we will have to come to your castle.
Correct.

2690
01:47:22,381 --> 01:47:23,700
And when they do,
like what do you,

2691
01:47:23,701 --> 01:47:26,280
what do you work on them?
What do you like to fill out?

2692
01:47:26,281 --> 01:47:29,700
About 120 pages of copious paperwork on
them.

2693
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:32,130
Psychological profiles and much of this
stuff.

2694
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,980
And do you have someone go over that or
do you go with that?

2695
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:36,500
Personally,
I'd have many people do you do this with

2696
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:39,000
20 to 24 per seminar.
Wow.

2697
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,620
And how long,
how many days is the seminar?

2698
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:41,573
Uh,
eight.

2699
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,250
Eight days.
So the first thing I have to dress in a

2700
01:47:44,251 --> 01:47:46,110
suit.
You have to dress in a suit and the suit

2701
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:48,960
and you have to start at eight in the
morning and it goes til midnight.

2702
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:51,750
Jesus Christ.
So you basically go on to sleep,

2703
01:47:51,751 --> 01:47:52,980
getting up,
going to work again?

2704
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:54,120
Correct.
Trade days?

2705
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:55,480
Correct.
Wow.

2706
01:47:55,490 --> 01:47:57,240
And uh,
they can't use,

2707
01:47:57,290 --> 01:48:00,810
I have two gymnasiums at the castle,
but they can't use the gymnasium unless

2708
01:48:00,811 --> 01:48:03,310
they earn it.
You have to earn it.

2709
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:06,720
You have to show me something that you
got to have more than a,

2710
01:48:06,721 --> 01:48:08,640
a,
a jelly fish brain.

2711
01:48:08,930 --> 01:48:11,190
Hang.
The last two seminars didn't have any

2712
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:13,140
gym time.
No gym time.

2713
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:14,250
Nope.
Hmm.

2714
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:18,180
No gym time.
So they just didn't earn it.

2715
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,273
Yeah.
They didn't earn it.

2716
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:22,050
He had only about half of them cried the
last seminar.

2717
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:27,080
Only half and one half.
How come the other maybe had a pair?

2718
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:29,370
I don't know.
When they cry.

2719
01:48:29,371 --> 01:48:31,620
What are they crying from?
Uh,

2720
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:33,060
the buttons.
The emotional buttons.

2721
01:48:33,061 --> 01:48:35,460
We have two bank accounts in life.
You as well.

2722
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,800
Okay.
Well we have an emotional bank account

2723
01:48:37,801 --> 01:48:38,730
in the financial bank account.

2724
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:41,340
Okay.
Most people are not successful.

2725
01:48:41,341 --> 01:48:43,260
Not because they run out of their
financial bank account.

2726
01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:45,870
They're not successful because they went
out of the emotional bank account.

2727
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:47,220
Ah.
Interestingly,

2728
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:48,450
how so?
Okay.

2729
01:48:48,530 --> 01:48:48,911
I'll,
I'll,

2730
01:48:48,911 --> 01:48:51,010
I'll explain a little,
uh,

2731
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:54,630
addition to that.
People come to me for either they're

2732
01:48:54,631 --> 01:48:58,140
inspired or desperate.
Even the few people that think they're

2733
01:48:58,141 --> 01:49:00,150
inspired aren't,
they're desperate.

2734
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:03,810
I'm the last,
I'm the last town saloon.

2735
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:05,940
He have tried Tony,
uh,

2736
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:08,160
grant cardone.
Jay Abraham.

2737
01:49:08,161 --> 01:49:10,020
You've tried every mother fucker that
walks,

2738
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:12,720
that tells you it's easy to be
successful.

2739
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:16,320
I tell you just the opposite.
It's a motherfucker to be successful.

2740
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:19,740
And uh,
so when you come to me and I look

2741
01:49:19,741 --> 01:49:23,490
through your psychological profile and I
measure you a day by day,

2742
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:25,020
uh,
sitting there,

2743
01:49:25,021 --> 01:49:26,130
uh,
for 14,

2744
01:49:26,131 --> 01:49:27,920
16 hours a day,
um,

2745
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:31,410
then you have one hour private time with
me and I go through this,

2746
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,420
uh,
you know why you're really here.

2747
01:49:33,421 --> 01:49:36,210
I asked you what's the most defining
moment in your life up to today.

2748
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,650
I mean,
coming here,

2749
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:40,230
what's the most defining moment for your
siblings?

2750
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:43,350
What's the most defining moment of,
um,

2751
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,273
uh,
your parents?

2752
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:46,680
Uh,
why do you think it's defining,

2753
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:49,030
Oh,
my dad got out of jail for the last

2754
01:49:49,031 --> 01:49:49,864
time,
you know.

2755
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:51,880
Okay.
We've had convicted murderers at

2756
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:52,733
seminar.

2757
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:53,710
Yeah.

2758
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:55,690
Convicted murderers.
I did their time,

2759
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:58,660
you know,
as long as you're not an obvious,

2760
01:49:58,661 --> 01:50:00,670
and I'll get in trouble for this.
Obvious,

2761
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:04,140
I'm
a cross dresser.

2762
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,970
Whew.
You can come to the sort of feel like a

2763
01:50:06,971 --> 01:50:09,880
non obvious crossdresser well,
I mean you wear your regular clothes you

2764
01:50:09,881 --> 01:50:10,714
should be wearing,

2765
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:14,110
in other words,
if you are a man,

2766
01:50:14,111 --> 01:50:15,370
dress like a woman,
right?

2767
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:19,030
You got to dress like a man.
But what if you're a man who really

2768
01:50:19,031 --> 01:50:20,950
looks like a woman and he's dressed like
a woman?

2769
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:23,660
No.
It as I don't see him naked.

2770
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:25,000
Okay.
As long as him naked.

2771
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,100
Yeah,
I understand.

2772
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:29,230
You just don't want any disruptions.
Correct.

2773
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:32,080
You don't even want any aberrations,
anything that's weird that gets in the

2774
01:50:32,081 --> 01:50:34,000
way of what you're trying to be weird
anyway.

2775
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:37,480
I mean,
when you see grown men cry and bigger

2776
01:50:37,481 --> 01:50:39,670
than me sobbing uncontrollably,
I mean,

2777
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:41,940
well,
what causes them to this emotional bank

2778
01:50:41,941 --> 01:50:44,210
county you were talking about?
You have a financial bank account to

2779
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,450
bank account.
That'll give you an example.

2780
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,330
Okay.
Um,

2781
01:50:48,070 --> 01:50:49,000
a guy who,
uh,

2782
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:53,020
was raised in a whorehouse,
his mom is a whore.

2783
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:56,440
He knew that his mom was a horse and
she's a six,

2784
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:57,274
seven,
eight.

2785
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:01,030
He still lives in the whorehouse.
How old is he?

2786
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:03,520
26.
Jesus Christ.

2787
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:07,840
How old his mom?
50 I think.

2788
01:51:07,841 --> 01:51:08,680
50?
No,

2789
01:51:08,681 --> 01:51:12,790
she like oil or just like,
I've never met him going down per

2790
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:13,690
gallon.
Uh,

2791
01:51:13,691 --> 01:51:15,280
I don't know,
but she's the MME now.

2792
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:17,390
Oh,
she's not servicing to me.

2793
01:51:17,391 --> 01:51:18,760
That's crazy.
And he lives there.

2794
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,140
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

2795
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:22,570
What kind of bags do you think that kid
has fucked?

2796
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:24,183
Yeah.
Yup.

2797
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:26,180
Tarred.
And a,

2798
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,420
what was the worst thing you ever saw
your mother do?

2799
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:32,140
You know,
tears are streaming down his cheeks and

2800
01:51:32,141 --> 01:51:32,951
I go,
he goes,

2801
01:51:32,951 --> 01:51:34,300
um,
there's too many to count.

2802
01:51:34,301 --> 01:51:37,390
Mr Penny,
do you think about it every night?

2803
01:51:37,391 --> 01:51:38,590
He says,
yes.

2804
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:41,680
How did you know Mr [inaudible]?
How do you not know?

2805
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:43,390
Exactly.
Yeah.

2806
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:45,280
Yeah.
And He's successful.

2807
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:47,470
The little shit hosing.
Yeah.

2808
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:48,820
What'd he do?
A,

2809
01:51:48,821 --> 01:51:50,590
he's a,
an engineer.

2810
01:51:50,591 --> 01:51:53,080
He's doing these women,
end up small engineering firms.

2811
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:56,020
Wow.
That's a hard way to grow up,

2812
01:51:56,021 --> 01:51:56,854
man.
Yup.

2813
01:51:57,630 --> 01:51:58,570
When,
I mean,

2814
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,310
if loved got the job done,

2815
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:02,300
okay,

2816
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,280
we'd have a perfect world now.
We'd have no wars.

2817
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:06,080
If love debit that got the job done
right.

2818
01:52:06,081 --> 01:52:07,640
You love doesn't get the fucking job
done.

2819
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:11,070
What does get the job done?
Pulling the trigger,

2820
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:13,460
taken action,
following your dream.

2821
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:19,640
So when you have these guys crying,
you're just sort of explore exposing to

2822
01:52:19,641 --> 01:52:23,720
them what emotional baggage they're
carrying around with them that's

2823
01:52:23,721 --> 01:52:25,880
hindering their professional life.
Correct.

2824
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:27,870
Well that amongst a bunch of this stuff.
Yeah,

2825
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:30,920
but that's kind of a,
it couldn't be a good summary.

2826
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:34,370
So by this eight day pressure cooker
that you put these guys through it,

2827
01:52:34,371 --> 01:52:36,710
when you're making them work all day for
eight days in a row,

2828
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:39,320
you,
you essentially like establish like this

2829
01:52:39,321 --> 01:52:41,930
is what it's like to try to be
successful.

2830
01:52:41,931 --> 01:52:44,780
You have to funnel to be,
to be a high,

2831
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:46,243
my market

2832
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:51,110
is to turn people into the top.
This just say the 7 billion people on

2833
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:52,000
the planet.
Right.

2834
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:57,140
My market is 700,000 you want to be one
of those 700,000 high performance

2835
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:59,300
individuals.
You come and see me.

2836
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:02,080
I want to go right now.
Okay.

2837
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:03,070
I'm not even,
no,

2838
01:53:03,190 --> 01:53:04,990
no glad a lot.
Last week,

2839
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,390
the week before last,
we may just three announcements of three

2840
01:53:07,391 --> 01:53:10,060
of our guys.
One Guy who is a monkey,

2841
01:53:10,330 --> 01:53:10,991
looks like a,
you know,

2842
01:53:10,991 --> 01:53:13,510
you were talking about chimpanzees.
He looks like a chimpanzee.

2843
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:16,030
He did a billion dollar deal with
Goldman Sachs.

2844
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:18,580
Well,
you couldn't smell Goldman Sachs or a

2845
01:53:18,581 --> 01:53:21,520
billion and he did a billion dollar deal
and he,

2846
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,530
he actually looks like a chimpanzee
social.

2847
01:53:24,990 --> 01:53:25,823
Oops.
Okay.

2848
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,160
Okay.
Another guy,

2849
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:30,850
uh,
he had $181 million deal and Australian,

2850
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:34,640
he weighs 200 kilos.
That's a lot.

2851
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:36,650
That's a big fucker.
Big fucker.

2852
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:40,800
During the 400 pounds and a 440 pounds
during the graduate,

2853
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:43,960
adore during the graduation on 'em we
go,

2854
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:46,900
we went to Edinburgh for new years eve.
Uh,

2855
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:49,250
he got stuck and he got stuck in the,
uh,

2856
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:51,560
in the toilet.
In the bus.

2857
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:52,380
Okay.

2858
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:53,700
He got stuck.
He couldn't get out.

2859
01:53:53,730 --> 01:53:55,050
Yeah.
How'd you get them out?

2860
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:56,110
I wasn't there.
Well,

2861
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:57,810
my wife said,
why aren't we going on the bus with

2862
01:53:57,811 --> 01:54:00,030
them?
Shit's going to happen and I don't want

2863
01:54:00,031 --> 01:54:01,530
to be there.
Literally.

2864
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:02,490
Yeah.
Wow.

2865
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:04,110
Okay.
And another guy,

2866
01:54:04,111 --> 01:54:05,940
and I get this,
he had a closing.

2867
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:11,350
He came to me when he was 17 years old.
He had a closing in Washington dc a few

2868
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:14,070
days ago and sally and I were there.
When you close it financial,

2869
01:54:14,071 --> 01:54:17,970
do you have to have two sources of id
now because of money laundering,

2870
01:54:17,971 --> 01:54:20,040
et Cetera.
He had a passport.

2871
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:25,410
A second source of ID was a driver's
permit because he's not old enough to

2872
01:54:25,411 --> 01:54:30,411
have a driver's license.
He had a driver's permit and a passport.

2873
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:35,300
He did a $3 million deal.
Jesus,

2874
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:39,020
he's a teenager.
The reason why teenagers do better is

2875
01:54:39,021 --> 01:54:40,940
because they have less baggage.
Uh,

2876
01:54:40,941 --> 01:54:44,330
that makes sense.
They haven't had as much life wearing

2877
01:54:44,331 --> 01:54:46,460
them down,
not as much scar tissue,

2878
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:48,290
scar tissue,
scar tissue.

2879
01:54:48,291 --> 01:54:49,270
That's real shit.
Right.

2880
01:54:49,330 --> 01:54:52,400
If you take a kid 18 it's got physical
attributes,

2881
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:56,660
you can train him into being in a guy,
probably easier than you take a 38 year

2882
01:54:56,661 --> 01:54:57,410
old.
100%.

2883
01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:58,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

2884
01:54:58,190 --> 01:54:59,570
So yeah.
It's almost impossible.

2885
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:00,411
Yeah.
Well,

2886
01:55:00,411 --> 01:55:03,290
unless they're a super freak athletes,
it's been involved in something versus

2887
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:06,460
freak athletes.
The Black Guy Jones,

2888
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:07,500
John Jones.
Yeah.

2889
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:08,560
Cause he's still around.
Yeah,

2890
01:55:08,561 --> 01:55:09,131
sure.
Yeah.

2891
01:55:09,131 --> 01:55:10,150
He looked,
he,

2892
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,290
somebody broke,
known him was,

2893
01:55:11,291 --> 01:55:13,700
he's not the guy that got a broken leg.
No,

2894
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:17,170
that's Anderson Silva.
Then Jones got finally get beat.

2895
01:55:17,450 --> 01:55:20,710
Jones has never lost.
The only time he lost was he was

2896
01:55:20,711 --> 01:55:24,400
disqualified in a fight against Matt
Hamill where he was dropping.

2897
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:27,910
It's a really stupid rule,
but you're not allowed when you're a on

2898
01:55:27,911 --> 01:55:30,700
top of a guy to drop an elbow from the
12 to six position.

2899
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:31,800
Yeah.
Okay,

2900
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,910
so he got to squat,
but he beat the fuck out of that guy.

2901
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:34,950
Still the roundup loss.
Yeah.

2902
01:55:34,951 --> 01:55:35,411
Yeah,
yeah.

2903
01:55:35,411 --> 01:55:37,810
He's,
he's on the suspension right now for

2904
01:55:37,811 --> 01:55:41,740
testing positive for a banned substance
and desilva came back.

2905
01:55:41,890 --> 01:55:43,470
Anderson Silva came back,
broken leg.

2906
01:55:43,471 --> 01:55:44,160
I remember seeing

2907
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,300
that.
Jesus Christ,

2908
01:55:45,301 --> 01:55:48,210
that was terrible.
That's one of two broken legs I've ever

2909
01:55:48,211 --> 01:55:50,880
seen like that live.
I've seen him on videos before,

2910
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:54,030
but being there live here at snap,
I did not hear it snap,

2911
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,760
but I saw a give out and I saw him fall
down.

2912
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:58,860
I knew it,
what it was the first time I'd ever seen

2913
01:55:58,861 --> 01:56:02,130
it was a guy named Corey Hill.
He threw this kick and the same thing is

2914
01:56:02,131 --> 01:56:02,791
like,
it's kicked,

2915
01:56:02,791 --> 01:56:05,460
got checked and his legs just snapped
out from under him.

2916
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,980
And that time that the referee didn't
see it,

2917
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:10,590
the referee didn't know.
The guy had a broken leg and we were

2918
01:56:10,591 --> 01:56:12,480
screaming at the referee to stop the
fight.

2919
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:15,960
It was a,
I was at Mike Tyson's,

2920
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:17,730
uh,
when you win the championship in

2921
01:56:17,731 --> 01:56:20,840
bringing really wow.
And that was in the third row and uh,

2922
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:25,740
Deniro and a bunch of Italian guys were
behind me Devito and he was,

2923
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:28,290
well he,
the guy that lost that,

2924
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:29,730
he looked like he was going to lose.

2925
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:33,870
He looked afraid at Tyson and Tyson was
hitting him with such velocity.

2926
01:56:33,871 --> 01:56:38,871
The perspiration on the guys head was
flying over the first two rows on to me

2927
01:56:39,121 --> 01:56:41,370
in the third bowl.
I mean he was hitting like,

2928
01:56:41,371 --> 01:56:42,480
let's sledgehammer.
Yeah,

2929
01:56:42,481 --> 01:56:44,460
when he was in his prime,
he was something special.

2930
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:46,770
It really was.
It was a really interesting article.

2931
01:56:46,771 --> 01:56:48,320
I just read about him in sports
illustrated.

2932
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:51,210
It's fascinating seeing him now at 50
years old,

2933
01:56:51,650 --> 01:56:54,810
you know,
family man doing his vegas show and I

2934
01:56:54,811 --> 01:56:58,050
bet she can still hit oh fuck yeah.
There was a video of him hitting the

2935
01:56:58,051 --> 01:56:59,430
bag.
It's still terrifying.

2936
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:00,990
I mean,
he's still Mike Tyson.

2937
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,600
Yeah.
And one of the greatest boxers of all

2938
01:57:03,601 --> 01:57:04,360
time.
The money,

2939
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:07,110
the most fearsome heavyweight that ever
lived in his prime.

2940
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:08,850
There was nobody liked him.
Yeah,

2941
01:57:08,851 --> 01:57:11,610
I was on a,
on a Concorde with Muhammad Ali.

2942
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:13,290
Uh,
and um,

2943
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:14,843
the,
uh,

2944
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:16,440
and he,
uh,

2945
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:21,440
had his Angelo Dundee is that the guy he
had his entourage with him and uh,

2946
01:57:21,901 --> 01:57:22,591
the,
uh,

2947
01:57:22,591 --> 01:57:24,330
he was very nice man.
Very nice.

2948
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:26,040
Uh,
only met him that one time.

2949
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,200
And uh,
that's not true.

2950
01:57:28,230 --> 01:57:30,960
I was in the cotton club in 1978.
Cotton club,

2951
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:34,110
black nightclub used to be.
And um,

2952
01:57:34,530 --> 01:57:35,041
the,
uh,

2953
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:37,190
there was a black comedian and I was
trying to,

2954
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:38,780
uh,
read,

2955
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:39,670
uh,
at Fox,

2956
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:44,070
right Fox and I'm the only white guy in
the audience.

2957
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:46,320
And he said something about white
people.

2958
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:49,950
So I had been tuned up pretty good.
And then back in [inaudible] 78,

2959
01:57:49,951 --> 01:57:53,340
I thought it was pretty tough.
I stood up and I said something back to

2960
01:57:53,341 --> 01:57:55,440
them.
Now this went over like a Turd in a

2961
01:57:55,441 --> 01:57:56,880
punch bowl.
I mean,

2962
01:57:56,950 --> 01:58:01,950
all these people that are around me,
all the color of Fox.

2963
01:58:02,670 --> 01:58:04,030
And so fox is,
Eh,

2964
01:58:04,031 --> 01:58:05,520
you don't want you to come up here.
And so I go,

2965
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:10,640
and then Muhammad Ali was sitting about
six tables over and he protected me.

2966
01:58:11,070 --> 01:58:13,200
He said,
we've got to let this white boy alone.

2967
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:15,090
I mean,
we don't want a problem here.

2968
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:16,290
So then I say,
well,

2969
01:58:16,630 --> 01:58:17,870
yeah,
you don't have to protect me.

2970
01:58:17,871 --> 01:58:20,610
And I've just was a idiot facility.
Young man.

2971
01:58:20,690 --> 01:58:21,420
Yeah,
yeah.

2972
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:24,170
And uh,
I tried to pay the bill and Muhammad Ali

2973
01:58:24,171 --> 01:58:24,720
says,
no,

2974
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:27,950
your money's no good here.
The money's nothing.

2975
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:29,363
Oh,
no.

2976
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,211
Yeah.
They didn't,

2977
01:58:30,211 --> 01:58:31,200
not forcibly believe,
but,

2978
01:58:31,201 --> 01:58:34,170
but essentially they know it's over.
Yeah.

Listen.

2984
01:58:41,771 --> 01:58:41,980
Damn.
