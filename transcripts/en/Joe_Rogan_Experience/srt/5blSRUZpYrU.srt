1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,800
Uh,
do,

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,380
do,
do,

3
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,650
do,
do,

4
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,420
do five,
four,

5
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,850
three,
two,

6
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:07,440
one.
Boom.

7
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,303
It's over.

8
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,660
We did as chairs.
So chairs is now November,

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
November.
Here we go by the November,

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,100
November.
Like that.

11
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,640
First of all,
who's fucking stupid idea was to do this

12
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:27,641
God damn fitness challenge Tommy Buns 
last year we did a nice calm 15.

13
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:33,980
Hot Yoga is so awful.
Not even close.

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,920
Not even close to this.
No.

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,990
This was so much more difficult and I 
didn't expect this,

16
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,790
but I like it.
I liked it.

17
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,430
I think it's fun to be competitive with 
your friends.

18
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:46,170
Yes.
It's a fun thing to fuck around,

19
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,680
but like,
like isolating something like this.

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,370
Oh,
it's a year.

21
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,680
You get to see different sides of people
you didn't know existed.

22
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,510
Oh yeah.
Jesus Christ.

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,270
You worked out too.
You have no idea.

24
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:57,104
I don't think anyone,
anyone gets the real perspective when 

25
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:04,970
joe is focused on something.
I've never seen anything like that in my

26
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:05,630
fucking life.

27
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,463
Well I know the funniest because like 
everybody's competitive and this brings 

28
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:09,704
it out.
But like the funny thing was like Bert 

29
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,490
being like,
whatever joe does,

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,970
I'll do double.
Definitely he was like,

31
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:21,971
fuck that and that and the other thing I
didn't expect ever.

32
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,400
I thought Ari would just be like,
whatever.

33
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,810
I'm just going to walk in the East 
village.

34
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:27,644
I was worried about him the most.
I didn't think you were going to do 

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,493
shit.
Worried about him the most from the 

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,300
beginning.
His brain.

37
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,180
Yeah,
I know I'm out.

38
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,170
Fuck this.
That's what you were saying that though.

39
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:38,270
Three days in which you were texting 
like this is dumb.

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,590
No,
no,

41
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:38,851
no,
no,

42
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:39,160
no,
no,

43
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,461
no,
no,

44
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:42,100
no.
He says that this is what he's saying.

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,560
He's saying that and he means it when he
says it,

46
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:45,930
but he's also going to fucking kill you

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,500
scotch and then it gets really serious 
and not serious.

48
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,723
But I was looking for loopholes in order
to trick you guys decide to like not 

49
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:52,844
work out.
So I thought if I get like a bunch of 

50
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:54,734
points,
like all to join in like seven or eight 

51
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:59,190
days in and then you can be done.
No,

52
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
that I'd be like,
they'd be like,

53
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,011
what the fuck?
Like,

54
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:02,150
yeah,
I've been secretly working out,

55
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:05,060
but now we're too far away,
so don't try to catch up.

56
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,561
Oh,
right,

57
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:06,394
right.
Was like some psychological sneakers he 

58
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,163
was doing.
He was saying you should just do your 

59
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:12,530
regular workout and see what your score 
is like.

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,633
Oh yeah.
That was a bit bigger than try to 

61
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,834
control.
That was a big fan of that one to 

62
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,670
regular fucking way because you were 
entertaining that for a second.

63
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,030
Getting.
I was like,

64
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,450
this is so stupid.
This is.

65
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,660
But then I was like,
I can't lose.

66
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,703
And then uh,
then I thought about it and the other 

67
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:29,550
thing I was thinking was this is what I 
was,

68
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,690
this is what my plan was.
My plan was to keep up with you guys for

69
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:34,524
two weeks.
And then after two weeks to set aside a 

70
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:41,040
lot of time and about and elap us.
Yeah,

71
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,491
about,
well,

72
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:42,690
no,
just go psycho.

73
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,700
I was like,
I'm just going to go psycho.

74
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,683
I'm going to put up pace that I don't 
think anybody else can keep up with for 

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,990
the last two weeks.
The last two weeks I just said I'm going

76
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:56,430
to put in some 600 point five days.
I put in 1000 point day.

77
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,410
That's that's,
that's when I.

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,980
that's when I stopped looking at you

79
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,780
for context.
I was looking at the.

80
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,110
When we started this month and I put in 
my $700 a day,

81
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,820
everyone was a little bit like,
wow,

82
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,271
Bert.
I,

83
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,360
by the way,
I ran almost a marathon that day.

84
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,443
Have no fucking clue.
I was just looking at my goddamn phone 

85
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,784
the whole time.
Just checking,

86
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,910
just checking the points.
I was always keep.

87
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,270
Some people don't know what the points 
are.

88
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,133
Well explained.
If you get 70 percent of your max heart 

89
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:20,320
rate,
that's three points a minute.

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,470
If you get 80 percent of your max heart 
rate or above,

91
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,520
that's four points a minute,
so we all tried to stay in the 80 range.

92
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,820
That's where you get your money,
right?

93
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,850
That's where we work out for an hour in 
that range of 80 to 100 a heavy workout.

94
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,990
It gives you 240 points,
so maxed,

95
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,700
maxed out.
That's just gives you context.

96
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,300
What a 600,
which was not.

97
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,860
I did a 930 cheese weight workout.
It was over after that.

98
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,950
I was in New York.
He'd call him.

99
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,310
He's like,
dude,

100
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,210
he's just fucking going dragging elk 
around.

101
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,830
He has it all the whole time is dragging
us around.

102
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,150
That wasn't even that one.
That was the.

103
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,890
The the elk hunting day was mostly 
hiking mountains day.

104
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,560
That was like a 600 point.
Oh No.

105
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,330
That's when,
when,

106
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,980
when you were there and you were 
actually working out in the mountains as

107
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:08,120
well though.
I was like,

108
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,160
what the fuck?
You're like,

109
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:10,120
if I would've been like,
guys,

110
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,023
I'm.
This is.

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,460
I made the mistake of jokingly saying,
Oh,

112
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,770
I got them Joseph on an elk cutting 
vacation,

113
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,540
and the hunters were like,
dude,

114
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,610
it's not a fucking vacation.
It's work.

115
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,740
And I was like,
easy guys.

116
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,153
Well you got a backpack on and you can 
walk as money as the most I've ever 

117
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:31,420
walked 12 miles in a day and you're 
walking up and down in elevation,

118
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,230
you're going up and down.

119
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,063
Like I,
I saved it one day because it was so 

120
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:39,451
ridiculous because I'd gone up and down,
I forget like 130 flights of stairs.

121
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,240
Some something fucking crazy.
But you ended up getting your.

122
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,840
What'd you shoot on this island with 
1000 pound elk?

123
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,660
Elk.
You gotta like relatively quickly,

124
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:50,040
right?
Yeah,

125
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,250
on the first day.
Thank God.

126
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,450
So then I came back in those days,
came back,

127
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:56,284
but the nod in 35 point day,
that was my big was a thousand points 

128
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,783
because I did 935 in the day and then I 
did a podcast and then I did 100 later 

129
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:08,050
on in the day just to see you guys 
anymore.

130
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,200
Yeah,
that's what I was wondering if there was

131
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:13,060
like I didn't have,
there was a,

132
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,010
it was a part of,
it was time management.

133
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,990
I was suffered socially from the most 
part.

134
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,520
Huge part was like who had the most time
to spend in the.

135
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,413
Yeah,
yeah.

136
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,760
I was here two Mondays ago,
last Monday,

137
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,594
and it was,
it was popping out at the comedy store 

138
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,570
is going to hang out with everybody you 
know.

139
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,740
And then it was like,
Nah,

140
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:32,630
it's 10:00,
I gotta get a couple of hours.

141
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,560
Then all your walls,
your workouts were so late,

142
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,423
so I got to say that fuck you with you 
post in your goddamn workouts in the 

143
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,120
middle of the night.
It was so deflating.

144
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,663
You go to bed.
I've got a two point lead and the wake 

145
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:47,591
up and go,
how am I?

146
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:49,840
Six hundred points by.
I started to break spirit.

147
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,683
It was fun because that's the other 
thing already went through when he got 

148
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:55,630
this tracker and he found out all the 
work workarounds.

149
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,190
So he would build up work in his tracker

150
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,890
and then he'd Bluetooth it in the middle
of the fucking night.

151
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,930
I'd also do the workout.
The workout is doing workouts at 1:30

152
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,763
AM and then I'd be like,
let me change and go out there two in 

153
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,280
the morning.
Oh,

154
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,900
you're going?
Yeah.

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,690
I thought you were uploading in the 
middle of the night.

156
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,080
No one can see the time.
The time that he was actually doing it.

157
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,610
Yeah,
it's the freaks route.

158
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,113
It was common.
I thought that because I already was so 

159
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:25,670
out of shape,
his heart rate was just skyrocketing,

160
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:26,504
like Ralphie walking upstairs and then 
already and I went on a walk on a hike 

161
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,243
and I was in the yellow the whole time 
and Ari was barely in green and I was 

162
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:34,881
like,
oh,

163
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,590
he's in.
He's in really good shape,

164
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,860
and then you did that day with.
He bought that theory really hard,

165
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:40,694
that hit,
that hit that it was just that he was 

166
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,410
out of shape so that.

167
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,920
And he was saying he was selling it so 
hard and I called him.

168
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,150
I had to go on the hike.
He's definitely shaped them immediately.

169
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,053
It's a psychological thing.
You don't want to think that a guy who 

170
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:02,990
hasn't been working out at all is in 
good shape,

171
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,620
but I think you pushed yourself through 
the first week or two.

172
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,080
Then you got in good shape and then I 
kept going.

173
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:10,160
Okay.
First of all,

174
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,290
I had fought by plants.
Okay.

175
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,400
What was the plan?
Okay.

176
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Michelle Wolf offered to give.
Let me just have her wear the thing from

177
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,740
day one.
That was definitely the fall,

178
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,610
but I knew that was going to happen 
regardless,

179
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,070
miles a day,
every day,

180
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,360
and when I asked her,
I was like,

181
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:27,194
hey,
would you wear this thing for me if I 

182
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,510
needed you to do?
She goes,

183
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,890
I know what you're talking about.

184
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,690
Absolutely aware for you.
Whoa.

185
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,710
I will stay in the right zone.
I'll tell no one.

186
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,430
She feels left out because she thinks 
she would laugh.

187
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,240
She goes,
this is none of this is what we do.

188
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,253
Like I don't do long cardio sessions.
I did five and a half hours on an 

189
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,840
elliptical after running for an hour.
What?

190
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,150
Yeah.
Hey,

191
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,660
get one of those.
I got 935 points.

192
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,613
I ran for an hour and then I stayed on 
the elliptical for five and a half 

193
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:01,754
hours.
You would see it go and you check in by 

194
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,313
fucking broken.
Got Three hundred points and then you 

195
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,600
talk and he checked back in 30 minutes 
later like,

196
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,710
oh no,
it's still going.

197
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,650
It's still going.
Yeah.

198
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:10,060
I just fuck.
Well,

199
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:13,110
I wanted to see how far I could go.
The thought was like,

200
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,320
when you're tired,
how tired are you?

201
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,790
Can you take another step?

202
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,470
Okay.
Can you take two?

203
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,210
Okay.
Can you take three?

204
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,700
Can you just keep going?
I bet you can keep going.

205
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,180
Let's see how long I can keep going.
And then you get to this point where you

206
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:27,014
just just think about breathing.
Just think about what I was thinking 

207
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:32,090
about.
I was just thinking about in and out,

208
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,950
so just trying to stay almost like a 
meditative state.

209
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:36,590
Trying to stay in the zone and I was 
pouring sweat.

210
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:39,310
I set off the fire.
Alarm was so much.

211
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,720
It's set off the fire.
It was like four hours in.

212
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,360
I feel like that's a story most people 
don't get to tell about themselves.

213
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,730
You know?
It was madness.

214
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,743
This is not how I work out.
I work out for like maybe an hour at 

215
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,680
most.
I hit the bag,

216
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,130
I'll do some

217
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,600
rounds.
I lift a little weights.

218
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,120
I'm not trying to kill myself like this 
was.

219
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,130
This was very interesting because I 
didn't.

220
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,053
I didn't know what,
how my body would respond to like a 

221
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,900
month of psychotic exercise.
Did you do the things you guys do,

222
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,520
the things where you would,
you'd be like,

223
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,560
the voice would say you got to quit,
quit,

224
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,240
take a walk for a little bit,
then go back and do it,

225
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,740
and then if you just go like,
oh,

226
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:19,890
I'm at four point eight miles,
let me just go until five or like,

227
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,813
or like I'm almost at halfway through 
this hour so let me just get to 30 

228
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,170
minutes and will be downhill.
I can stop there.

229
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,840
It fucked with my obsessive 
compulsiveness really bad.

230
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,700
Yeah,
because I get to the place where I go,

231
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:30,534
all right,
I just want to get to 200 points and 

232
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,031
then I'd be like,
Oh shit,

233
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,650
I'm only at 950 calories.

234
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,470
I want to get to a thousand dollars.
It's like,

235
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:38,010
oh,
I'm right.

236
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,900
I'm right by 2:20,
I want to get to 20.

237
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,420
And then it gets to a point where you 
get.

238
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,980
I believe it's like it's you get in the 
zone when you go,

239
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,570
I'm just going to keep going.
I'm going to.

240
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,170
Everyone's asleep.
I'm going to keep walking and,

241
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,270
and dude,
it got bad with me to the point where I,

242
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,140
I mean we'll talk,
we should talk about physical breakdowns

243
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:55,974
and a little bit,
cause I know all of us dealt with some 

244
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,594
sort of physical breakdown,
but I was having nightmares that you 

245
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:04,350
guys have fucked with my tracker,
put it in that I was younger and lighter

246
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:09,351
so I wasn't earning the night in a panic
and checked my fucking stats.

247
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,150
But somebody got into your shit and 
hacked it and I was like,

248
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:15,640
these.

249
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,420
No,
I wouldn't put it past them that yeah,

250
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:20,250
you get that printer.
Can I tell you my other treatment?

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,833
Okay.
I figured out pretty quickly that the 

252
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:27,801
way they do your Max heart rate is your 
age minus a certain number of minus your

253
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:29,844
age and then you get it from there.
Then when you actually run it will move 

254
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,640
up or down from there.
But right away I was like,

255
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,200
oh,
okay.

256
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:40,530
So I entered my age and before I started
I wrote to the my zone people and said,

257
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:45,531
my idiot wife wrote my age in wrong.
I'm actually 74 was born in 44,

258
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:50,730
not 74 and 44 the other way and like,
all right,

259
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:52,790
we'll change it for you.
So yeah.

260
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,350
So you put the other 70 year old man 
profile.

261
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,810
Yeah.
Hold on,

262
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,403
hold on,
hold on,

263
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,713
hold on.
The whole month you are working on is 

264
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,240
done that.

265
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,073
That problem is.
I had already set it as the other thing 

266
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,380
and so it'll say you have to.
Then you have to have a brand new thing.

267
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:12,860
It didn't work.
Oh yeah.

268
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,963
It would've been great for me.
It'll just a walk around casually 

269
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,740
earning yellow the whole time,
which I could have gotten.

270
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,150
That would have been insane.
Yeah,

271
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,400
that was definitely a good cheat my 
mind.

272
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:24,330
That was,
that went wrong.

273
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,040
I was like,
fuck.

274
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,710
I feel like that one would have 
disqualified you for sure.

275
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,573
I can still do that.
I'm still on the fence with these 

276
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:35,790
fucking five hour hikes he was taking.
Well listen man,

277
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,500
hiking is work.
It is.

278
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,910
Work it fucking.
You're going uphill for log.

279
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,450
Fuck you guys worked hard.
No,

280
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,890
of course you did.
You did.

281
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,733
You did.
I saw him here on the rowing machine 

282
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,870
going hard for an hour.
I've watched it on my hikes.

283
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,790
It's hard when you go,
go,

284
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,080
fuck it.
You earned it.

285
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,310
I'm not going to shit on that at all.

286
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,770
We should really,
really keep ourselves from judging.

287
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:04,910
How hard are the people work?

288
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,700
Every time I did somebody got a big 
score.

289
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:09,300
I was like,
what's your.

290
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,640
Do you cheated?
How'd you cheat?

291
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,520
My hardest workout?
Scored the shittiest my hardest workouts

292
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:16,200
or running the hills and lifting 
weights.

293
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,323
If I run the hills,
it gives me almost 40 points less than 

294
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,874
if I just wrote a bike or wrote an 
elliptical machine and you go up and 

295
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,120
down.
You want the pause.

296
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,700
The way I do it is I run hard and I take
breaks.

297
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,683
I take like a deep breath when I get to 
the top of strokes dick the whole time 

298
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:37,020
too,
so that's difficult.

299
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,873
Rub My balls to tell him what my left 
hand and I give myself another sprint 

300
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,163
until I can't.
I have like these points where I know I 

301
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,830
can make it too if I go full clip and 
then I try to extend it a little bit and

302
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,673
I keep trying to extend it,
but when I do that I'm going into the 

303
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:53,270
red and on top of going in the red,
um,

304
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:57,890
I'm with lifting weights.
Like you need recovery time and recovery

305
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:58,070
time.

306
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,000
Your heart rate crash is way low.
You could just do the elliptical machine

307
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:05,270
and just couldn't like 15 resistance.
So it's got some,

308
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,720
some give to it and you start sweating 
and then you get into a zone.

309
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,320
You just get into a niche way easier.
[inaudible] it's a machine,

310
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:13,154
makes it all easy,
but you just get into a zone and you 

311
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,180
just got to be strong.
I think the thing with those,

312
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:18,014
I mean,
even though like if you do the intense 

313
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:22,280
workout recovery is gonna be,
you know,

314
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,050
you're going to need it,
you're going to feel it.

315
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,940
If you do those for like days in a row,
there is still a fatigue,

316
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,010
right?
That there's fatigue,

317
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:31,844
but there was no like in a week.
And what was getting me was the 

318
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:36,290
pounding,
the running up the hills.

319
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,070
There's no counting on the elliptical 
exactly what stays in it.

320
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,930
My feet were starting to hurt by the end
because I was running miles in the hills

321
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:46,880
every day with those minimalist shoes 
on.

322
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,650
Which man,
those things they,

323
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,493
they,
they really do work like they really do 

324
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:53,024
work.
But the way they work is they make your 

325
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,244
feet work harder.
So if your feet aren't conditioned for 

326
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:58,220
that Shit,
man,

327
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,890
you feet are like one of the first 
things that wear out,

328
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,100
like a nice spongy running shoe is just 
you just so much like smosh smosh.

329
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:07,454
Every time you step on things,
if you get that and it's gone and you 

330
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:12,230
have this like really thin layer of 
rubber with some tread,

331
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,460
it's just your foot hitting the ground 
over and over and over again.

332
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:18,140
There's very little padding.
None.

333
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,560
Were you using the ultras as well?
The running shoe.

334
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,394
The ultra.
I was using one called zero and I was 

335
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:30,221
using a one called Vivo Vivo barefoot.
They're my favorite ones there.

336
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,110
They're really good because I was 
wearing the five toe ones,

337
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,560
but Jim and my toes into shit.
I'm running hard.

338
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:39,290
I'm tired because I'm fucking exhausted,
so I'm like,

339
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,880
I need something that covers all the 
toast.

340
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,960
I don't jam one into a rock because I'm 
too exhausted.

341
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,940
Walk me through what your.
What a regular workout it was for you.

342
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:50,610
I'd be curious of what everyone's 
regular workout was.

343
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,980
What I would do is I would,
if

344
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,320
I would run,
I would run for an hour,

345
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,880
just an hour.
Just take my daughter hills there,

346
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,890
running the hills because it gives.
It's two things.

347
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:02,900
One I.
He needs exercise.

348
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:03,900
He's young.
He loves,

349
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,780
he loves to run with me and two,
it's a real good form of exercise.

350
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,643
It's like it's.
I know it's more beneficial than the 

351
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:15,260
elliptical machine.
It made my ass bigger,

352
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,660
made my legs bigger.
Like they all got bigger.

353
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,140
Like especially like I could feel my 
pants fit different.

354
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,020
Really?
Yeah.

355
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,503
Yeah.
Because I've only been doing this for 

356
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:25,760
like two years.
Yourself up puts also,

357
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,200
nature has got to be healthy for you 
too.

358
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,720
Before that I was doing just 
weightlifting stuff with for my legs.

359
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,590
I would do like squats or do cleans and 
presses and overheads,

360
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,900
you know,
do leg presses with kettlebells,

361
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:40,370
overhead and stuff like that,
which is all great.

362
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,820
It's all really good stuff,
but it's not sustained motion.

363
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,863
There's something about a sustained 
motion of running hills that I think 

364
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:51,240
boosts your vitality.
It gives you more energy because you're,

365
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,280
you're.
You have to work,

366
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:55,700
so to run a hill is one of the more 
difficult things to do an exercise.

367
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,800
It's just,
you've got to fucking.

368
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,723
Just kidding.
You're basically doing like bodyweight 

369
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,840
squats with one leg over and knocks when
you're going uphill.

370
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,880
I got a 45 man.
It's hard,

371
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,760
so beneficial.
When I went to hitting the bags,

372
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,600
what I would do is on days I would do 
that.

373
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,434
I would run and then I would get on the 
elliptical machine or I'd run and I'd 

374
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:15,494
get on the bike or the echo bike,
which is like a beefed up airdyne 

375
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,573
machines.
Things fuck you up or that assault 

376
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,290
thing.
The assault fitness treadmill.

377
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:24,950
Like that one.

378
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,140
I love it.
It's fucking hard.

379
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,390
It's really hard.
It's not a treadmill,

380
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,520
it's not enjoyable.
It's an extra bump,

381
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:34,370
harder than running on the road,
running on the road,

382
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,423
much harder than making yourself to make
it harder than that because for real 

383
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,960
self powered and it's really beneficial 
for brother treadmill.

384
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,630
For that one.
It was a mistake.

385
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,750
It was not bird.
It was the right move.

386
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,040
It's harder than running.
I had that in my man cave was.

387
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,510
That was my go to at the end of the 
night,

388
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:56,180
was good on that thing and dude that was
not forgiving.

389
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,980
Wear you out.
It's called an assault fitness trainer.

390
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,010
That's the air runner.
Air Runner,

391
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,923
yeah.
It's supposed to be shit at least 30 

392
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,990
percent harder.
It's shit.

393
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,640
I love it.
I love it.

394
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,450
I get on that thing.
It's like saw you got it,

395
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,450
and I was like,
you like that?

396
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,290
And you're like,
I love it.

397
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,820
I was like,
I'm out.

398
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,730
He doesn't hurt your knees.
It doesn't stop pounding.

399
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:20,564
It's got a good amount of give to it 
because it's got this tread to it and 

400
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:23,564
it's just got enough shock so that as 
you're running you don't feel like it's 

401
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:29,000
a big pounding on your joints,
but it's all self propelled,

402
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,360
so you'll really get a good rhythm going
and your fucking legs get tired.

403
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,020
What's Great Ford is sprinting on it.
You can get up and sprint.

404
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,883
You can.
You can end your sprints that really 

405
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,250
raised your heart rate.
I think the key also,

406
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,020
here's a big key.
You got to be distracted.

407
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,273
You got to be able to either be 
distracted by meditating and getting 

408
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:46,244
into some sort of a weird breathing zone
or you got to listen to podcasts or you 

409
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,320
got to listen to music or you got to 
listen to.

410
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,540
For me,
it was books on tape did the best really

411
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,350
for when I was out in the wild.
If I was out in the wild,

412
00:17:58,351 --> 00:17:59,184
I was listening to books on tape.
I'd like something thinking about 

413
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:04,350
something distracted me from the 
physical exertion of exercises,

414
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,800
but indoors it was a two things.
Helped violent movies and fights.

415
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,173
Watching fights.
You just get your get your heart rate 

416
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:15,234
jacked up when you get your heart rate 
jacked up and you're watching guys get 

417
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,200
hit and you fucked it honestly

418
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,453
before know,
watching football and especially if the 

419
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,870
treadmill and then during timeouts you 
could like do whatever.

420
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,000
I would do the thing where like you just
kind of going,

421
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:30,560
going,
but I noticed that there was like a punt

422
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:31,990
return or it kicked off

423
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,233
when I watch gladiator.
There was a giant spike whenever there 

424
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:43,770
was sword fights and I was like,
oh my God.

425
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,690
That's what I'm doing.
I'm getting.

426
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,060
I'm allowing myself to get so caught up 
in this movie that I'm like fighting.

427
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,010
I'm a break.
Breaking them up right now.

428
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,540
Yeah.
I got to sit in the red dude.

429
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,280
I gotta give a shout out to run the 
jewels.

430
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,370
Run the jewels is perfect.
Fucking can run the jewels.

431
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,450
Mit a killer,
Mike.

432
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,930
Dude.
Nice tools.

433
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,911
Fast.
Run them,

434
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:09,130
run them tools.
They affect perfect momentum.

435
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,623
I listened to nothing.
When I think when I think about this 

436
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,080
month,
I'll.

437
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,970
I'll think.
I'll think of two things.

438
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,013
I thank God it's over and I think could 
run the goddamned jewels because that's 

439
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:20,704
all I listened to.
Running great running song and a great 

440
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,124
running song.
We'll give you like 10 percent more 

441
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:26,344
than.
Oh yeah.

442
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,150
It kicks into overdrive on some songs.
You're like,

443
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,013
oh wait,
it's this one,

444
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,850
and then you're waiting for the beat.
The drum,

445
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,660
the.
Oh,

446
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,780
you're just start going and going.
I get real excited.

447
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,330
Angry if like I'm going to fight 
somebody.

448
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,950
If I put on a lot of public enemy,
just put it on a mix of public enemy.

449
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,930
I'll feel like that's good too.
That's good.

450
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,980
You don't got me through the first week 
and with you guys was like,

451
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:50,920
Oh,
I think I'm okay.

452
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,680
I'm watching all your specials.
I brought the fucking necklace thing out

453
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:59,270
there.
I want you netflix special going.

454
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,243
Ha.

455
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,173
You write jokes.
Did you read any jokes while you were 

456
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:10,290
running?
I don't think I did.

457
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,230
I didn't write any jokes about the jail.
I wrote so many goddamn jokes.

458
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,940
Really?
Did you really?

459
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,833
Oh fuck yeah.
I smiled at a woman when I was jogging 

460
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,560
and I said,
uh,

461
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,820
the joke was that only smiling?
No,

462
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,880
I'm not having a stroke.
I'm not flirting with you,

463
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:25,260
honey.
I'm just trying to not have a stroke.

464
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,870
I went to a dark place to a dark place 
and you took us with you.

465
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,670
Okay.

466
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,690
I was.
I was like,

467
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,700
I'm going to win.
I thought I was like,

468
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,240
yeah,
whatever you think you can do.

469
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,210
Let's keep going.
Let's see what happens.

470
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,090
That's a weird switch that goes off.
It's like,

471
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:46,580
let's see who's willing to die.
Well,

472
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,823
all my last week or so was dangerous.
It became a fight for my people were 

473
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:56,290
asking me about.
It's just dehydration.

474
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,980
That's all it is.
Just dude.

475
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,490
People would message us.
By the way,

476
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,343
guys,
Joe,

477
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,680
Joe's going,
I'm okay.

478
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:03,940
I didn't get wrapped up,
but people,

479
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:04,774
some people were upset,
like they wanted me almost to get it 

480
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:09,730
because I've always rag on these 
crossfit guys to get it.

481
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,773
I have not ranked on them.
Would have said is that I have heard 

482
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:17,800
some negative opinions about crossfits 
from experts that are trust.

483
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,723
Like Steve Maxwell.
I'm not a fitness expert by any stretch 

484
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:21,664
of the imagination.

485
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,590
I don't know whether they're crossfits 
bad or good.

486
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,650
I bet it's probably based on your 
application,

487
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,600
the way you do it,
because if somebody asks me,

488
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,510
is Jujitsu good for your body?
I'd be like,

489
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:33,220
well,
I've had a bunch of surgeries.

490
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,520
Everybody I know's had surgeries.
Everybody I know that does Jujitsu,

491
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,673
he gets up.
He didn't even get his blue belt and he 

492
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:41,920
had surgery right before we started this
podcast.

493
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:45,700
Joe Did say those crossfit people are 
tree hugging hippies.

494
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,700
Yoga,
black belt.

495
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,260
I want a yoga black belt.
I love it.

496
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:53,110
Yoga black belt.
I'm like a blue belt and yoga dude.

497
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:53,944
Halfway through the month.
I told Tom the other day and he laughs 

498
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:59,440
and so I tried it on stage and a worked,
but I stopped producing semen,

499
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,710
just coughing,
dust,

500
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,390
dude.
My Dick had the dry heaves.

501
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,224
Just people ask me.
It's like there's your sex drive to go 

502
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:07,680
up with Mike.

503
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,650
And I wanted to be like,
yeah,

504
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:09,590
but then I was like,
no,

505
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,740
no,
no energy for that.

506
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,440
I'll be so tired,
so tired.

507
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,990
How about those sleep?
So I was sleeping like a fucking perfect

508
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:19,330
person,
like a baby most of the time.

509
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,343
You know what I noticed is a big one for
me that really might make me change the 

510
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:28,381
way I live is zero anxiety,
zero negative chatter.

511
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,553
That's what I found.
There's a realistic view of the world 

512
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,630
that you get from rigorous exercise and 
this is my theory and it's.

513
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,890
I'm not a biologist,
but I think that there's.

514
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,473
We have too much of a history as a 
species of constantly avoiding danger 

515
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,273
and I think we live in a place that's 
far too safe for our natural instincts 

516
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,293
and so we're constantly looking for 
things to be bad or looking for things 

517
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:57,070
to be dangerous or confronting.

518
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,113
Confronting our own mortality and 
putting it on the back burner and 

519
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:04,660
letting all that weirdness manifests 
itself in all sorts of other fears.

520
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,703
Fears about the government,
fears about economics and fears about 

521
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:09,064
this.
And I think we're dealing with as human 

522
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:14,680
beings all the time and I think there's 
only a certain amount you can do.

523
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,010
And I think when you have rigorous 
exercise,

524
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:18,844
it puts in perspective what that certain
amount actually is and what you can 

525
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:23,104
control as a person that you can.
You can just chill your body out and 

526
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,380
look at this whole thing for what it is.
It is what it is.

527
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,780
You know what?
We're going to be fine or we're not,

528
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,850
and then it won't matter,
but this,

529
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:34,684
this,
this whole thing that we do when we do 

530
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:36,904
this,
we do this because our body has a need 

531
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:41,320
for exercise.
It has a built in neat.

532
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,303
It's got an engine that needs to be 
pushed and if you don't push it starts 

533
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,010
fucking you.
It

534
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,320
starts fucking with you and asking you 
weird questions like,

535
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:49,910
what the fuck is that guy think he is 
like,

536
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:54,050
he wants to start problems that wants to
get upset if things don't make any sense

537
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:54,884
to be upset at it wants conflict is a 
part of you that wants conflict because 

538
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:58,994
it thinks that conflicts are part of the
programming because it's been our way 

539
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:02,534
for millions of years.
So whatever the fuck we were then to 

540
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:07,130
whatever the fuck we are now,
there's been conflict along the way.

541
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,083
People have been trying to eat us,
things have been trying to kill us and 

542
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:10,814
this is the only time ever that.
There's none of that and I think the 

543
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:16,400
only time you could see things with 
perspective is when you blow out all the

544
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:18,860
biological shit,
whether it's jerk off,

545
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,910
like how many times have you jerked off 
and then had a totally different opinion

546
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,343
of a person above.
Because I gave George often not called 

547
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:30,620
people like,
why would I call this person?

548
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,860
I'm sorry.
Just jerked off now I see.

549
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,083
I see what this whole is some weird 
biological trick playing some stupid 

550
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:40,030
game.
I'm so high,

551
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,260
high,
high school,

552
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,610
Dude.
I love a.

553
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,720
I'll tell you what this woman did for 
me.

554
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,800
It got me back in spin class.
I love spinning classmates.

555
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,230
I love it dude.
I love it.

556
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,123
Good for you,
man.

557
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,860
Do you like music or know what to say?
Just make you spin it.

558
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,590
The task people.
It just close your eyes.

559
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,483
And you remember when we talked,
I said I had Bob Harper is my spin 

560
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,040
teacher one time and the thing he said 
about want me to go back and fuck people

561
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:09,550
I grew up with or whatever is Bob Parker
the coby Brian have spin classes.

562
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,870
Yeah.
But he's from biggest loser pow.

563
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,750
Okay.
And so I got.

564
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,520
Did you guys know who he was?
I have no idea.

565
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:20,521
Those are the big biggest loser fan.
Bye.

566
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,670
Like I liked the.
I liked the way they talked to you.

567
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:27,440
And it's fun.
I like closing my eyes.

568
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,720
I liked the first break,
a sweat I liked.

569
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,613
I love what I love and I have to say I 
have to give props to people more than 

570
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:35,684
anything with Ari doing that Rower,
redefine the way I had to look at 

571
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:41,150
working out because I went,
he,

572
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,023
he was an 80 percent.
Like I know what 80 percent feels like 

573
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,440
our on a.
it's

574
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,143
funny.
Some of them are harder than others to 

575
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,970
keep it eight percent biking was way 
harder.

576
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:52,980
I know you were capable of it seriously,
did you?

577
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,540
No.
No.

578
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,810
I thought he was capable of running.
And stuff,

579
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:59,160
that's fine.
I could sort of do that,

580
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,930
that,
but I know quite how much.

581
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,020
Eighty percent on a rower.
He's angry person.

582
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,100
Yes.
Even when he's playful and that's my zen

583
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,060
spot,
but even when he's playful,

584
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:13,710
angry,
it's still energy.

585
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,340
Like that anger,
like the anger that he gave everybody on

586
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:21,870
that fucking podcast you did with one of
my favorite podcast ever.

587
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,310
Always hiking around doing a podcast,
talking shit about us.

588
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,810
Not Seventy percent.
It's brilliant.

589
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,270
It's brilliant,
but it's,

590
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,183
it's energy.
See that kind of anger that you have 

591
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,960
that's either in you or it's not.
I knew already had it.

592
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,250
It's a matter of getting the whole 
engine fired up again.

593
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,193
He's not too old now.
He used to play basketball law needs to 

594
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,523
do when you buy.
One of my resolutions this year was to 

595
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:46,284
go to the gym like once a week,
like something attainable and I still 

596
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,410
hadn't done it until.
I remember when you did you Jitsu,

597
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,240
you were very enthusiastic about it and 
I remember you were fucking trying hard,

598
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,820
you know,
and I remember one time you legitimately

599
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:02,840
swept me legitimate.
Yes he did.

600
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,080
It was a brown belt,
I was a brown belt.

601
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,523
People once in a while.
I do it just once in a while you'd be 

602
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,490
like,
oh,

603
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,440
I forgot to tell you 100 percent the 
truth.

604
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:14,940
This is what happened.
He was,

605
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,400
we were rolling together and I was like,
okay dude,

606
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,430
let's just do this.
I'm not going to hurt you.

607
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,590
Cool.
And we got into position.

608
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:25,770
I got on top of him and I just got a 
little relaxed and all of a sudden,

609
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:29,280
boom,
Ari hip pops takes my leg out from under

610
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:34,281
me and he swept me and I'm like,
you mother fucker got a little poem,

611
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:35,330
and he exploded.

612
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:35,911
I like,
oh,

613
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:36,810
okay.
I see what's up.

614
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,810
So I knew a part of already that you 
guys did know because already now,

615
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,683
by the way that he swept me right back 
and so part of me that really wants to 

616
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:46,734
experience like trying to roll with Joe 
for a second after this contest and 

617
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:54,591
knowing what he's capable of just to 
feel true helplessness feeling it is.

618
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,780
This is why it's a good feeling because 
if you.

619
00:27:57,781 --> 00:27:58,614
If you can handle it,
then at least you know where you are on 

620
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,154
this little weird food chain of who can 
kill with their bare hands and then you 

621
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:08,130
also know that whatever these people 
know you can learn to do.

622
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,033
It's not a physical thing.
Like I know guys that are much weaker 

623
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,820
than me that can fuck me up.
If we rolled together,

624
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:16,890
they're going to tap me 100 percent of 
the time.

625
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,870
My friend Danny,
my friend Danny,

626
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:21,150
weighs a hundred and 60 something 
pounds.

627
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,610
I've never.
I mean I tapped him when he was young.

628
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,690
He kills me.
He strangles me.

629
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,670
He strangles me.
Just what?

630
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:31,440
Superior techniques.
That's way better than me.

631
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,360
Way better way more focused.
Been doing it.

632
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:37,670
You realize that sounds like to a guy 
who just with you,

633
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
but here's the thing.
I don't have to listen.

634
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,760
You have to have the time to get serious
about something.

635
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,120
We have the time to get serious about 
this for a lot of time to get serious,

636
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,680
but suddenly out of the blue.
By the way,

637
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,040
Tom suggested it like four or five days 
before it started.

638
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,030
Yeah.
This was not a planned out thing at all.

639
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,030
Been wearing that thing for perspective 
though.

640
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,163
I started January with it and like an 
average one has been probably 2100 

641
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:04,170
points or something.

642
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,820
How much you get this one?
90 five.

643
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,733
So talk about.
Talk about the percentages of how we 

644
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,840
finished in the [inaudible] that 
everybody hitting them up.

645
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:13,674
That blew me away.
Well they said there's a million 

646
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:18,660
registered users first of all.
And zero point one percent.

647
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,740
Okay.
But hold on.

648
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,480
Most of those warranty didn't even have 
it on.

649
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,330
I don't know about that.
Like we're going into November is now.

650
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,263
We're not really.
I'm not saying everybody was actively 

651
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:31,960
all using a million users.
Yeah.

652
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,760
Well whoever is using it.
Well I don't know what the database.

653
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:36,720
How it's.
It's a good point.

654
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:37,554
All right.
That's a fair point because like we 

655
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:39,414
really don't know what percentage of 
those people actually keeping people 

656
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:42,304
trying.

657
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,740
We know the killer was a d one athlete 
though.

658
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,970
Yeah,
you're fucking.

659
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:46,804
Jim has a.
that's the thing that we can actually 

660
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:50,680
pointed against people who were trying 
to guess.

661
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,514
If we agree on a number,
would you guys say that like half the 

662
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:58,351
people would use it regularly or no?
There's a million people with behalf.

663
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,933
Even if it's a quarter,
we're still talking about point five 

664
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,220
will be point four,
point five percent percentile,

665
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,840
whatever.
90 nine point fifth percentile.

666
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,340
Yeah.
I wouldn't go up much.

667
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,560
Wouldn't go up much.
Even under a smaller variable,

668
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,394
but I think that what those other people
are at the top are probably fitness 

669
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:20,230
instructors and that was.
That's what my space is my space.

670
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,460
That was nice though.
Yeah,

671
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,930
that's what my zones told me.
Oh,

672
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:23,764
that was my other cheap plan.
Go to the gym with $15 and say please 

673
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:31,051
wear this and seen the sweet spot.

674
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,550
I.
It wasn't too much,

675
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:35,530
but I would have to do it a lot.
Fuck this.

676
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,131
I'll tell you.
Let me.

677
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:36,964
Oh,
like I'll walk you through my plan the 

678
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:39,420
whole month.
What was your plan?

679
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,240
Do not get hurt.
That was number one.

680
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,443
I was like,
don't get hurt because if I get hurt or 

681
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:45,334
get heel spurs on windows.
I was so excited at the prospect of you 

682
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:52,510
being out anytime someone has you hurt 
your ankle or something,

683
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:57,511
but when I hurt my ankle but cautious 
and I knew this is not real.

684
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,920
You saw me slip side.
Then I saw her.

685
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,730
I swear to God.
I'll call my fucking wife right now.

686
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,320
My friend molly saw you in fucking spin 
that day.

687
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,290
Expand the one exercise you don't use 
your legs for.

688
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,820
Were you worried about them?
When I was sick.

689
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,020
Oh,
I knew.

690
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,330
I knew you were giving me the fuck off.
Oh,

691
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,100
I can't make this up.
Wyatt guys,

692
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,190
he told me he was sick and he took 
photos of his medication and he went one

693
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,700
day and then you were right back to full
speed.

694
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,410
Thank you Ari.
Thank you.

695
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,280
Already.
That's not true.

696
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,190
What has it been crazy that a day where 
I was like,

697
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,053
look,
I got to get something and then buy 

698
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:50,883
something.
I was thinking $150 or so and that was 

699
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:56,620
the beginning of or the second worst day
and I put it on.

700
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:57,730
I was like,
I'll just get that.

701
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,130
And I walked down the street and I was 
like,

702
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,600
I felt so sick.

703
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,850
I got 40.
That's it.

704
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,840
Like a nun.
Okay.

705
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,471
That right.
Yeah,

706
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:08,950
true.
The next day I was able to get like,

707
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,310
I think a hundred and something and that
was split up into also.

708
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,190
And so then I was like,
I'm pretty fucked right now by the way.

709
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,530
Right at that point I was like,
okay,

710
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,210
burt,
we're not coming last.

711
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:21,790
So that's great.
There's just a casual attended.

712
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,160
Two of us.
Uh,

713
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,490
Tom's done.
That's great.

714
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:26,400
That's awesome though.
Took a deep breath.

715
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,240
I was like,
tell you something.

716
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,780
This is something that we should all 
pointed out for health.

717
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,180
Like I've been over the last couple of 
years,

718
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:35,014
I've been eating a lot of Kimchi,
a lot of fermented cabbage and a lot 

719
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,090
Kombucha.

720
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,120
Real.
Yeah.

721
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,800
Real brutal,
brutal farts.

722
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,813
But here's the thing,
all that healthy like probiotic stuff 

723
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,940
that has a big impact on your immune 
system.

724
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:50,923
I mean really big.
I haven't gotten sick in a long time to 

725
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,130
always take these.
And I started drinking them too.

726
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,580
They're always good to do the shit gts,
gts or the shit.

727
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:00,050
They're so good.
They taste good.

728
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,360
They're healthy for you at a whole foods
guy telling me like,

729
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:02,931
hey,
just so you know,

730
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:04,500
I saw your drink this in the thing.
It's five.

731
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,620
It's got alcohol so you can't.
You can't drink that in the,

732
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,940
in the store.
And I was like,

733
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,863
listen,
I'm going to do it every single time so 

734
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,510
you can just try to catch me if you 
want.

735
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,893
But for the warning,
you did your job well as less than half 

736
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,930
a percent of right?
Isn't that what it is?

737
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,760
What is the number that they have to.

738
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,840
It's more than one.
Hold on.

739
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,700
My daughter's drink Kombucha in the 
morning.

740
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,710
That's fine.
It's less than half a percent,

741
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,710
so they're not getting buzzed.
Some preposterous amount of alcohol.

742
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:30,230
I would like to see how many drink to 
get drunk.

743
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,813
The whole history of it.
They used to sell them in the store and 

744
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,990
then apparently what was going on was 
they were,

745
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,843
there were,
it's a strong brew and they would sit 

746
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,700
there fermenting and then when they 
would test them after they had fermented

747
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:44,534
for awhile,
the alcohol content would get over one 

748
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:46,754
half of one percent,
which is like somewhere around where 

749
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:51,560
they need to draw the line.
Like if you get a non alcoholic beer,

750
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,940
it's got a touch of the blues in it.
Oh,

751
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,660
really?
Already touched with buck off.

752
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,460
It doesn't matter.
Fucking idiot.

753
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,330
No,
it doesn't make you still super sober.

754
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,540
I mean if you look fucking perk.
Well,

755
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,890
we're running.
We're getting high as fuck.

756
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,080
Okay.
There's A.

757
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,510
There's an endorphin aspect to this.
I this.

758
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,130
One of the things that I was saying to 
everybody is that when this was over,

759
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:19,964
when the whole thing was over,
if somebody made a pill that made me 

760
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:26,420
feel how I feel when I have those hard 
workout days,

761
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,760
I take that pill every day.
That's what I was going to tell you.

762
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:33,020
What the fuck pill that I felt so much 
relief,

763
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:38,021
but I felt like it was totally tied to 
days where I really worked hard,

764
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,043
like one of the.
If it was like a medium workout without 

765
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,063
good,
you and I went back and forth about 

766
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:44,271
that.
Yeah.

767
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:45,104
I still felt good,
but on the days where it was like three 

768
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:51,440
plus hours of working out and I was 
totally spent.

769
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,603
Then I felt the most calm.
I mean I know a part of that physically 

770
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,590
just got tired.
I'd had zero strength.

771
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,693
Question.
Do you guys think any of that's tied to 

772
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,164
like while you're doing it,
you've got to be off your all your 

773
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:03,650
technology for awhile?
I know you're big on that.

774
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,570
I think that's a possible.
No,

775
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,700
I thought about that.
No,

776
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,660
it's a factor.
It's definitely a factor.

777
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,400
I also,
when you started talking about it,

778
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,293
I tried to start doing things like in 
the morning waiting or waiting to look 

779
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:15,280
at it.
No,

780
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,140
I like open the phone so like just do 
not even work out.

781
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:20,960
I mean just do life things,
wake up,

782
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,700
have coffee and just not look at it.
So I had to think about it.

783
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,700
Yeah,
it's hard.

784
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,440
It's hard.
Yeah.

785
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,481
It's hard.
Yeah.

786
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,610
I wonder how much of that too,
because I felt sort of clear too,

787
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:32,444
but same way I do with skiing where it's
like you gotta take your mind off 

788
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,870
everything in a way.
Exactly.

789
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:38,220
Ari Be skiing is a perfect example.

790
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,230
When you're skiing,
you can't look at your phone,

791
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,273
you're going down a fucking mountain in.
You're just enjoying that and that's 

792
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:48,891
part of what it is.
They've got a great app and they'll have

793
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,520
a great app.
No,

794
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,001
no,
no,

795
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,560
no.
Look at my phone while I'm skiing,

796
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:55,050
but there was an app that tells you how 
fast you get going,

797
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,453
dude.
I got an up to 40 miles per hour on a 

798
00:35:57,271 --> 00:36:00,060
fucking snowboard and you want to get 
down to the bottom.

799
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:00,811
I'm like,
real quick,

800
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:01,950
what's my speed like?
Oh,

801
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,790
I,
I've definitely.

802
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,150
I'm always worried about people wiping 
out in front of me,

803
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,990
wiping out onto me.
But you.

804
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,110
But you film your kids skiing a little 
bit.

805
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:10,944
Yeah,
but I got taken out by one dude on a 

806
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:13,314
mountain once.
He just cut in front of me like way too 

807
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:16,600
quick.
He was like,

808
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,730
you gotta control your skin half the 
time,

809
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,613
like I should go away for your own good 
watch out and you realize like you're 

810
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:27,060
testing your health out with all these 
other people and most of the time people

811
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,910
were doing their best.
Most of the time comes flying out of the

812
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:33,240
trees over your drug test.
When you get on that fucking ski lifts,

813
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,253
they don't test you for shit.
Do smoke weed when you're skiing now 

814
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,280
you're doing it wrong.
No,

815
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,411
no,
no,

816
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:45,780
no,
no.

817
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,310
Every time I asked we'd go with you 
guys,

818
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:51,600
but I ski with my kids.

819
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,170
Adults now.
I wish I could explain.

820
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,360
I have to keep an eye on those little 
fuckers.

821
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,620
Get care.
I get what you're saying.

822
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,470
When you see with your kids.
You do that with my kids.

823
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:10,380
I don't smoke weed at the end of the day
when it's me and Leanne,

824
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,030
we go to park city every year.
It's the best and at the end of the day,

825
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:15,923
me and Leanne,
I'll take a rip and then we'll go down 

826
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:18,264
one the.
That's one I fucking throw in headset's 

827
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:22,650
a little Jane's addiction.
I'm coming down the mountain.

828
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,620
All my toes flying into a fucking corner
at 40 miles an hour.

829
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,680
Just going.
Just thinking in my head.

830
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,110
This could all really go bad right now.

831
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,210
Don't fall down.
Don't fall down.

832
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:37,860
Don't get hurt.
Don't fall down.

833
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:39,980
Don't get her.
Didn't get hurt.

834
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,873
Don't fuck with us.
Just barely have any control of our 

835
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:50,860
bodies as we slide.
Barely,

836
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,140
barely in control pizza.
No control over joke and roll shoulders.

837
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,490
I'll tell you what,
I'll tell you what I want us to do right

838
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:09,324
now.
I'll tell you what I want us to do as a 

839
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:12,550
group right now and chose the only one 
that didn't get this happen.

840
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,000
What I want us to go to,
Kelly slater's wave pool.

841
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,530
That looks dope,
dude.

842
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,633
A foursome.
It's the safest place to learn how to 

843
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,750
surf and it's just like a two hour 
drive.

844
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:25,470
Does anyone know how to surf?
I took two lessons,

845
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:28,170
Indonesia and master it and retired,
but I can come out of retirement,

846
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:29,004
so that's perfect.
So you've had slightly more experience 

847
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:34,110
was almost none.
That would be a good next year.

848
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,040
What learned a certain time

849
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,430
on a board.
I'm on a board over the whole month.

850
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,823
We'll get Kelly slater to design some 
sort of board that we have to wear some 

851
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:51,781
sort of heart rate monitor.
How much time on a board you could stand

852
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:57,330
up over the course of a month.
Artificial wave machines.

853
00:38:57,331 --> 00:39:00,740
Shit.
I guarantee you.

854
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,583
Give Kelly slater time right now to 
develop the board that has feet pads 

855
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:09,091
that measures your feet,
your feet when you're standing up.

856
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,760
So at the time on a board standing up,
since none of us know how to surf.

857
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,623
Fuck time on a board,
standing up one of those artificial 

858
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:18,460
weight machines next year.
Kinda hate this.

859
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:19,930
I love this.
I love this already.

860
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,263
So you just have to enlist and a place 
you have to give up your life list in a 

861
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:24,634
place like why he was Shane Dorian.
Where those fucking sue shame was just 

862
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:29,890
here.

863
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,720
He was on the podcast right before you 
guys.

864
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,120
Who you fucking kidding me.
Who's using the,

865
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,300
the uh,
Shane Dorian almost died at Mavericks.

866
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,240
He got held under for two waves and he,
I guess under there,

867
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:42,880
he decided to create these suits where 
they have ceo to carf juices.

868
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,880
It Literally Changed Big Wave Surfing.
It's saves so many lives.

869
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
He was just fucking shut up.
I swear I met him.

870
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,250
He's my bow hunting buddy.
Yeah,

871
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:57,700
he lives in.
He lives at a big island in Hawaii.

872
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,880
Damaging Joanna was just do Kelly 
slater's.

873
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,160
He and I go hunting every year.
We do the,

874
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:04,270
uh,
the spring,

875
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,140
a axis deer hunt on the island of Lanai.
Really?

876
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,073
Yeah.
Yeah.

877
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,170
So fucking cool.
It's the coolest shit ever.

878
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,750
What got you into hanging out with Kelly
slater?

879
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:17,590
Podcasts was fucking amazing.
Like brothers.

880
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,350
My favorite thing he said in that 
podcast was when he goes,

881
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,184
uh,
you go,

882
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,330
what do you do for fitness?
He goes,

883
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:23,940
I don't push myself.
That's an,

884
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,180
that's an already thing.
Well,

885
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,050
here's the thing.
What we did was not healthy.

886
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,120
No,
this is what I wanted to talk about.

887
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,790
Not Sustainable.
I'm like,

888
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,200
no,
bullshit.

889
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,150
No,
not sustainable.

890
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:38,850
That's crazy.
No,

891
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,683
no.
I'm going to keep up spin class and try 

892
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:43,630
to do on evenings.
Try to do the six mile jog.

893
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,953
That's a good thought.

894
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,940
Keep up the 31st.
Like I talked to you.

895
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:52,941
I talked to everybody,
but that last workout I was dead.

896
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,173
I couldn't,
I couldn't have gotten that much 

897
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,510
further.
In all honesty.

898
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,583
After my pis came out a weird color.
I really did have phantom pain to my 

899
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:05,090
kidneys.
I really was like,

900
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:09,060
maybe that wasn't just dehydration.
Maybe there something more.

901
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,193
Maybe there's something going on.
I really did have some weird phantom 

902
00:41:12,301 --> 00:41:16,680
idea that there was a pain,
but physically I felt pretty good man,

903
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,100
because the whole thing was a lot of 
that Rhabdo.

904
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,440
And here's the thing about,
it's called Rhabdo.

905
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,260
My locis is that I said,
did I say it right?

906
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,260
Rhabdo,
um,

907
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,510
has actually been the source of death 
for a few fighters where,

908
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,190
um,
guys

909
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,400
got really beat up and it crazy,
really difficult fight.

910
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,293
And the thing that did the men was they 
were probably overtrained and they 

911
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:43,364
probably did too much and the gym didn't
give themselves enough time to recover 

912
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:48,050
and then had a really brutal fight.
Oh,

913
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:50,480
right.
So when you're young in particular,

914
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,240
you're,
you,

915
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,073
you're a little too wild and you don't 
recognize that there's like this point 

916
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,230
of diminishing returns when it comes to 
training.

917
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,143
Oh yeah.
Well see we pushed into some weird 

918
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:00,920
place,

919
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,150
but we did get through that a few times.
But here's the three will,

920
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:05,270
should have liked.
Thought I was too much.

921
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:07,820
We got to give up and we kept going and 
then it became okay again.

922
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,540
Right?
But here's why

923
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,600
I think it works for us.
It wouldn't work for a fighter.

924
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,050
No one's kicking our ass.
So the thing about when you're a fighter

925
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,830
is if someone's kicking your ass,
you might push even past where we pushed

926
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,490
in terms of output in,
in,

927
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,690
in any particular hour or any 
particular,

928
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,710
you know,
half hour,

929
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,870
40 minute session,
you might go too far.

930
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,740
Whereas we would just keep going at,
uh,

931
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,520
at 80 percent sometimes you get forced 
into 90 percent sure.

932
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,373
Long periods of time,
especially if someone's better than you 

933
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,950
or especially if you're tired from 
training.

934
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,740
So a lot of these guys are going into 
the fight,

935
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,873
especially in like younger guys who 
don't have maybe the most scientific 

936
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:44,864
coaches.
They're going into the fight stout like 

937
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,130
November first.
They're going through it like that.

938
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,760
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

939
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,593
They're going into it like that.
Not only they going into a fight like 

940
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:54,880
that,
but they're going through a whole,

941
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,641
you know,
six,

942
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:58,490
eight week camp like that.
Like they might be broken down like real

943
00:42:58,491 --> 00:42:59,324
early on.
They just push themselves through the 

944
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,990
whole thing and then they have like at 
the end of it,

945
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:06,380
their body's failing and they haven't 
given themselves enough time to recover.

946
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:08,640
And that's what this Rhabdo shit is 
your,

947
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:13,650
your muscles and it has something to do 
with proteins that your muscles pull up.

948
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:14,834
The actual.
Because I'm given a really stupid 

949
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,320
definition of what rhabdomyolysis is.
Am I pretty close?

950
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,693
What is it?

951
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,350
Breakdown of muscle tissue releasing a 
damage protein into the blood.

952
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,360
That's it.
And it's very dangerous.

953
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,570
Israeli causes kidney shutdown.
That was crazy.

954
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:32,404
That like November second,
my muscles all felt sore for the first 

955
00:43:36,191 --> 00:43:38,680
time all month.
Mine felt so right away.

956
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:40,990
And then not again for not again,
I just was,

957
00:43:40,991 --> 00:43:42,130
I would guess,
get back into them.

958
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,293
The thing in spin classes like when you 
get out of the saddle and sprint is I 

959
00:43:46,241 --> 00:43:50,320
just got to a place where my legs were 
always fucking wasted and I was like,

960
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:52,030
I want to get,
I want to try this again.

961
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:52,251
When,
uh,

962
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:55,210
my legs just aren't wasted.
They were always wasted.

963
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,073
I could now at the end of this like run 
to the gym and back I got stopped like 

964
00:43:59,351 --> 00:44:01,630
three times in the way in her run for 
like two minutes.

965
00:44:01,631 --> 00:44:02,010
I'm like,
no,

966
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,190
like real running.
Oh,

967
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,033
I.
Then it was like,

968
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:04,810
no,
just do it.

969
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,730
Did I felt like such an improvement,
right.

970
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,430
Huge them through the month that I could
run.

971
00:44:09,431 --> 00:44:14,431
I ran 12 miles on the fifth and last day
while you were on antibiotics,

972
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,760
psychotics and you were just going fine.
I gotta say Ari,

973
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,590
I always knew that you had a strong 
mind.

974
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,560
I always knew you had a strong mind.
You have,

975
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,760
you have a.
you're an angry man with strong mind.

976
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,013
But I didn't.
I didn't appreciate it as much as I 

977
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,063
appreciated this month for you to do it 
as the most impressive out of all of us 

978
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:36,924
because you didn't do shit other than 
the occasional hike or fuck around and 

979
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:42,240
play basketball for like 10 years

980
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,041
years.
Yeah.

981
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:48,041
But also I eat well.
You guys eat like garbage to you.

982
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,200
I'm not talking to you.
What do you were talking to those two?

983
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,410
Yes.
Seventy five to 80.

984
00:44:57,411 --> 00:45:00,170
I should be around one 75.
That's what you spoke about.

985
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:04,370
What you and I and I should wait with 75
to 80 and then I got up to like 83,

986
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:05,204
87 last year after the.
We waited like significantly more and 

987
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:12,290
it's like I'm not doing it.
You guys were actually working out.

988
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:15,190
You can keep fucking normal idiots.
Oh yeah,

989
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:15,740
no,
no.

990
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:20,420
I actually towards the,
towards the end I started.

991
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,463
I'd hear a problem.
Maybe I'm the person probably listening 

992
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:25,494
to this podcast the most for you.
Hear people talk about health and how 

993
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:29,504
they eat and you and an onion that 
challenge to the very last week I 

994
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:36,110
started going looking at food a tad bit 
differently.

995
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,540
Going like,
I don't want to feel like shit.

996
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,740
I don't want pizza.
I don't want.

997
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,633
I didn't want carbs.
I wanted protein because I get done a 

998
00:45:43,161 --> 00:45:46,010
workout and I go,
let's do four eggs and some mistake.

999
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,280
Like I ordered a bunch of Buffalo steaks
and I was like,

1000
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,830
what?
It's so crazy as I'd never.

1001
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,753
I was like,
water.

1002
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,770
Yeah,
I need water and food is such a crazy.

1003
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,713
Did you get like with eating when it was
like really on those fucking plane when 

1004
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:02,360
they walked by with a little basket and 
I was like,

1005
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,283
oh,
I'll take l this shit during the two 

1006
00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:07,610
workouts a day,
the two days,

1007
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:09,720
which had a bunch of net.
Yeah.

1008
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,400
When I did the whole five and a half 
hours on the elliptical,

1009
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:14,234
I ate a box of animal crackers and I 
drank a cream soda while you were doing 

1010
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:20,040
it.
While I was doing great soda,

1011
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,870
it was crazy.
It was like I was possessed.

1012
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,410
I was in the craziest state of mind.
I was like,

1013
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,890
I am going to keep this going like I'm 
now.

1014
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:33,110
I'm going now.
It's just numbers to me now.

1015
00:46:33,111 --> 00:46:35,420
It's like,
when do you get off at 400?

1016
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:36,740
No,
500.

1017
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,500
600.
No.

1018
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,270
Eight hundred.
No,

1019
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,510
and then shit started to feel like it 
was failing like our body.

1020
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,161
Yeah.
No,

1021
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:46,271
no,
no,

1022
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,600
no.
Some misfires.

1023
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,820
I had some misfires.
I had some,

1024
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:52,140
like my body was like,
Whoa,

1025
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,210
like settled down bitch.
It's like,

1026
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,540
we better get off this thing soon.
I was like,

1027
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,160
okay,
let's just keep going for a little bit.

1028
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,093
Yeah.
Then you said things started to feel 

1029
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,110
weaker.
Like my hand started filming.

1030
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,770
We started yelling racial slurs and I 
started feeling numb.

1031
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,610
My toes went numb at one point.
Did you nap?

1032
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:11,350
No.

1033
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,160
Oh,
I would not.

1034
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,993
Napping was the feet on the floor nap 
where you're just like sending it back 

1035
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,090
for a second and say like,
what?

1036
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,500
I haven't.
I just go out like a light at the end of

1037
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,333
the night.
Yeah.

1038
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,320
The Hours.
Were you sleeping tonight

1039
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,500
like a dead man?
Seven hours dead man dead.

1040
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,480
Yeah.

1041
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,190
How long after we started did you start 
having the marijuana

1042
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:30,850
dreams?
So you got,

1043
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,080
did you guys get them?
Um,

1044
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,430
I,
I knew it was coming so I tapered off,

1045
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,290
tapered off all through September and 
also I was on a lot of harmony trips.

1046
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,440
The elk hunting trip in Utah was seven 
days.

1047
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,240
I didn't smoke on those no together 
dreams on those a little bit.

1048
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,363
A little bit.
But you decided early on with all that 

1049
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:57,070
stuff that I wasn't,
I just wanted to experience it as a,

1050
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,660
as Electra,
natural,

1051
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:03,661
human and I didn't want to ever be drunk
and I didn't really want to be high.

1052
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,810
I don't want to take Beta blockers so I 
don't get nervous.

1053
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:12,430
I try to experience it as a,
as just experienced what it is.

1054
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,413
I saw Adam Green tree like kill some elk
and wherever the fuck he is these days 

1055
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,420
and a bear claimed it.
Did you see that?

1056
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:20,680
He shot a moose?

1057
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,573
Jesus.
It just went on and on it and I dug it 

1058
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:25,954
out.
Con and a grizzly bear claimed it and 

1059
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:31,510
covered it with dirt right away.
The entire Moose?

1060
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,241
No,
he,

1061
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:33,880
he shot it,
they took part of it.

1062
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:38,800
See what a moose is probably like 1800 
pounds.

1063
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,920
They're so big.
They're like a big elk.

1064
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,000
It like a rocky mountain.
Elk is like 800 pounds.

1065
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:47,170
That's a big one.
A Moose is a thousand pounds bigger than

1066
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:50,440
that when it's fully mature.
So something that's what Adam shot.

1067
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,880
He shot a gigantic moose so they could 
only carry so much of it out like this.

1068
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,730
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of 
pounds of meat.

1069
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:02,200
Eighteen hundred pounds moves might be 
seven or 800 pounds of it is meat.

1070
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:05,080
Fuck you.
So you have to take it out in loads.

1071
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:06,670
So if you have two guys,
right,

1072
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:08,050
you're taking it out.
Several loads.

1073
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:08,884
So they took out one pack out and then 
they came back and the giant grizzly 

1074
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:13,804
bear had claimed it and covered it up 
and the grizzly bear was still in the 

1075
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:17,930
area.

1076
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:18,800
He covered it up.
Dude.

1077
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:19,643
Adam green trees.
One of my favorite people to follow on 

1078
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:21,424
instagram.
But I know that no one likes when 

1079
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:24,940
there's a lot of little bleeps in the 
story,

1080
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,640
but when I go on out of greentree and 
he's got 100 little dots,

1081
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:28,091
I go,
oh,

1082
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,260
there's going to be a good one.
Yeah,

1083
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:33,070
it's Adam.green
tree on instagram and he's a,

1084
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:33,933
he's a bow hunter from Australia.
And Australia is an interesting place 

1085
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:39,100
because one of the reasons why it mean 
he's,

1086
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,120
he's just a real smart guy.
And he said he's the real deal,

1087
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,820
a real deal in every way.
Now I'll pick them as a person.

1088
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:46,540
Dude,
he,

1089
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,820
you should see the floor.
He hasn't.

1090
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,650
His hunting cabin he took.
Dude,

1091
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:52,840
this guy is like across the board,
every part of a man you want to be.

1092
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,900
How he met his floor in his hunting 
cabin is fucking amazing.

1093
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:59,470
And he did it himself by hand.
Let's just establish per capita.

1094
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:01,690
Australians are more manly.
Oh yeah.

1095
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,550
The Korean Americans for sure.
It's hard.

1096
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,050
Like if you had to like to see what's 
the numbers at,

1097
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:08,450
uh,
there,

1098
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:09,700
there's the uh,
Moose.

1099
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,430
This is there.
Just a manly,

1100
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:12,843
manly or breed of people.
And also you have to realize that 

1101
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:15,424
Australia was a god Damn prison colony.
So these are the ancestors of 

1102
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,540
scoundrels.
They all got big films,

1103
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,970
big humans.
So this,

1104
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:22,804
uh,
this is a big ass moves that he shot in 

1105
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:26,044
the Yukon and a grizzly bear claimed it 
and so they went back to it and the 

1106
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:32,540
grizzly bear had run off because he saw 
them coming I guess.

1107
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,583
And so they just stole what they could 
and got the fuck out of there before 

1108
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:36,584
they panicked

1109
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,650
for it.
Came back.

1110
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:38,870
And so they,
they,

1111
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,530
they buried the unburied at the dugout.
They did dig stuff and take stuff out.

1112
00:50:43,531 --> 00:50:44,850
But they were scared while they're doing
it.

1113
00:50:44,851 --> 00:50:45,684
And they got out of there.
This is the second of my friends so 

1114
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,290
fast.
This is sex?

1115
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,041
No,
no,

1116
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:50,874
no.
This is a third of my friends that has 

1117
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,530
had grizzly bear encounters over the 
last three or four years.

1118
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:00,660
Them who is the one that it was on?
I saw it on instagram.

1119
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:04,320
What's one of your buddies who got,
who got charged by the grizzly bear?

1120
00:51:04,321 --> 00:51:05,870
I was Adam.
That was Adam Green Tree.

1121
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,530
That was was that same guy?
Yeah,

1122
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,750
absolutely.
Was it that documentary?

1123
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:11,850
Grizzly man.
Oh my God.

1124
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:15,270
It's the craziest documentary.
That documentary.

1125
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,673
That documentary is called a gay guy.
That doesn't have really good friends 

1126
00:51:21,901 --> 00:51:24,890
who gets eaten by bears.
Dude.

1127
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,180
I was with a guy.
Wanted to give him a hug.

1128
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,150
That guy he has fucked.
Yeah,

1129
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:31,950
she.
Why did she leave?

1130
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,980
And there's audio and they didn't share 
the audio.

1131
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:39,830
They shared the audio fucking.
That was my friend Adam

1132
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,150
with a pistol out wild grizzly bears 
charging them.

1133
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,710
Watch this.
Turn it up.

1134
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:47,563
His voicemail.

1135
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,220
Yeah.
That's a grizzly bear.

1136
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:58,260
And he's got a gun player and she's got 
her cubs and he might charge,

1137
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,920
you know,
she might charge them the,

1138
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,070
the scariest ones.
The females with cubs.

1139
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,390
Yeah.
That's in real life too.

1140
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,770
What about the pistol?
Yeah,

1141
00:52:08,771 --> 00:52:10,360
he's going to pistol out.
And here's the thing,

1142
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,390
the pistol,
it was the wrong size bullets.

1143
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,110
So wouldn't have racked normally.
So see how it is right now.

1144
00:52:17,111 --> 00:52:18,940
It looks like he's discharged all his 
ammo,

1145
00:52:18,941 --> 00:52:22,780
like his guns out because it's jammed so
he doesn't even know it's jammed.

1146
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,123
So He's standing out there pointing a 
gun that the only way can get a bullet 

1147
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,710
in it.
If he opened up the barrel himself,

1148
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:33,640
stuck the bullet in and then closed it.
So we'd have one shot no matter what.

1149
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:37,470
So the whole magazine wouldn't fit.
It was off the.

1150
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:40,690
The differences in the size of the 
ammunition was off.

1151
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,770
You didn't see it?
Nope.

1152
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,410
He didn't notice because he doesn't use 
guns.

1153
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,990
He's a bow hunter.
You only got.

1154
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,670
He got a gun just to protect himself 
from that thing.

1155
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:49,970
Those kinds of.

1156
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,860
I cannot believe how excited I just got 
right.

1157
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:53,750
Then just talking to him about it.
He goes,

1158
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:54,584
mate,
he goes,

1159
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,670
monsters are reel.
He goes,

1160
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:00,800
when he goes,
when that thing was charging me,

1161
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,690
he,
I mean I believe.

1162
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:07,520
Did he talk about it on the podcast?
But when you talked about the way it was

1163
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:10,280
charged him with the hair was popping up
on it and you could see it.

1164
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:11,070
I mean it's,

1165
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:11,903
it false charged him.
So I've charged him and stopped within 

1166
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:15,410
like,
you know,

1167
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:18,260
five yards of him.
Wow.

1168
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,320
And it's a giant female grizzly bear.
And

1169
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,163
that would just tear you apart.
The only one is trying to get you to do 

1170
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,090
leave,
trying to get you to live live

1171
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,030
because he's trying to leave,
but it doesn't trust him.

1172
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,450
It doesn't know him.
So it's closing in on him and looking at

1173
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:37,350
him and deciding maybe whether or not 
he's a threat and moving in on him so he

1174
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:38,184
can't get away from it.
So he was stuck in this position where 

1175
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,900
he couldn't get away from it.
It had decided that he was a problem.

1176
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,650
So he was trying to get away and he was 
moving to a different direction.

1177
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:49,620
It was cutting him off and he was like,
Oh shit.

1178
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:50,930
And he's got his pistol out.
It's like,

1179
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:53,040
get the fuck away.
Terrifying.

1180
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,503
But thinks territory.
The Appalachian trail when I was in 

1181
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,500
college and not the whole thing,
but just a portion.

1182
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,870
And Man,
that fucking.

1183
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:01,704
I didn't know.

1184
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:07,900
You're a good man.
Grizzly thing.

1185
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:08,880
It's fucking scary,
man.

1186
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1187
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,573
They're so scary.
I've never seen one in the wild except 

1188
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:15,030
once in Alberta.
I've never seen like a big one.

1189
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,880
The one I saw in Alberta was willing 
only like six feet wasn't a big one,

1190
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,340
whether it was enough to look in his 
eyes and go,

1191
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:21,174
whoa.
That is a different thing because a 

1192
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:25,710
black bear doesn't look at you like that
man.

1193
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,293
Black bears.
If you run into a black bear and that 

1194
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:29,131
was.
They looked at you like,

1195
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:32,010
what do you,
what are you on the east coast?

1196
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:32,851
It's.
So.

1197
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:33,780
That's spot bear,
right?

1198
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,673
Well,
what it is is there's brown bears and 

1199
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:39,000
then those are the ones that live on the
coast,

1200
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,030
and then everything that's interior is 
called a grizzly bear.

1201
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,470
It's,
that's how he gets the name.

1202
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,490
Yes.
It's the same.

1203
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,490
Adam,
what do you mean?

1204
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:46,650
That's how it gets the name.
Yeah,

1205
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,960
it's,
they're all brown bears,

1206
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,940
but it isn't like a straight up brown 
bear always.

1207
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,600
Usually bigger than a grizzly because 
they have more access to protein.

1208
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:55,943
That's the thought.
The thought is that the Kodiak Brown 

1209
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:00,410
bears that enormous ones,
which are the biggest tall,

1210
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,920
still way bigger.
11,

1211
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,250
11 feet.
Yeah.

1212
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,523
My other friend who got attacked by 
Steven Rinella and he has a podcast 

1213
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:09,140
about it.
Uh,

1214
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,043
on a podcast called media,
that's his podcast and it's all about a 

1215
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,860
fog neck island.
It's a two part podcast.

1216
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:17,694
It's fucking amazing.
I think they shot an elk and then the 

1217
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:21,894
same thing.
They hung some of it up and they came 

1218
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:25,134
back to get it and after they packed 
some of it out and when they came back 

1219
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,900
at grizzly bear it claimed it and they 
didn't know it.

1220
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,530
So they were trying to pack out that 
food or that the rest of the meet.

1221
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,573
And when they did a bear charge down and
ran through their camp and they said it 

1222
00:55:39,551 --> 00:55:42,380
was 11 feet tall.
Who was he with?

1223
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,493
He was with my friend Yonis and my 
friend Remy Warren Warren Warren about 

1224
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,280
it,
my other friend dirt,

1225
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:50,114
meth and these and maybe one other guy 
going know all these hunters and I've 

1226
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:56,670
never hunted in my life.
I think there's like cameramen.

1227
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,533
There was a bunch of people and this 
enormous 11 foot bear ran through the 

1228
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:03,420
camp and they said it was the biggest 
fucking thing.

1229
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,760
It was so different than anything that 
could've expected.

1230
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,690
They said it moves so fast,
it's teeth were so close to them.

1231
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:10,823
They said this like Rinella.
When he describes that he rainelle is a 

1232
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:16,920
brilliant guy,
but he's also a very well read guy.

1233
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:19,190
It's very eloquent.
He has a degree in journalism.

1234
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,180
He's like,
he's super fucking smart.

1235
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,220
So when he describes this interaction 
between

1236
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,053
them and the 11 foot coastal brown bear,
which like the biggest bears on earth 

1237
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,490
next to the Grizzly,
the polar bears bigger,

1238
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,820
whether like the coastal brown bears of 
Kodiak,

1239
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:37,750
Alaska,
that area.

1240
00:56:37,751 --> 00:56:42,751
There's big as those polar bears,
just the fucking most by the scariest.

1241
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:47,140
Everybody wants to save him because the 
Klondike bars and fucking call you.

1242
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:48,143
She had the most ever when they.
They can sniff out through ice that 

1243
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,840
there's seals under the ice and they'll 
just.

1244
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,893
You'll just see the,
the like the wildlife footage and 

1245
00:56:58,061 --> 00:56:58,894
they'll just sniff ice and then they put
their paws together and they start 

1246
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:03,034
dropping all their body weight,
trying to crack to crack the ice and 

1247
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:08,400
then they'll jump in and just pull out a
seal.

1248
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,550
It's fucking nuts.

1249
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,990
Do you think we could tap into that part
of our brains,

1250
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,040
like there's a part of a human.

1251
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,600
I don't have any polar polar bears.
There's a reason why you have an iphone.

1252
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,480
You get a nice car.

1253
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,180
Polar bear genes.
Somebody out there,

1254
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:31,014
a polar bear genes,
so for sure probably some of y'all 

1255
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,700
fucked by a bear.
I got fucked.

1256
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,320
Get fucked by bear.
You know what's crazy about this month?

1257
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,240
Now I'm fucking pretty fucked up.
Yeah.

1258
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:46,920
What's crazy about this month is a 
inspirational people on instagram,

1259
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,790
like to listen to them and to really 
draw inspiration.

1260
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:54,780
I got one more hunter's last name.
I'll say campaigns.

1261
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:55,973
Fucking shit man.
When you go and put them one of those 

1262
00:57:58,261 --> 00:58:00,600
days and realize he's running a marathon
every day.

1263
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:01,390
Marathon a day,

1264
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,720
a marathon a day,

1265
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,120
but let me just.
In his defense,

1266
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,253
he would never.
He would step in and probably say right 

1267
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:12,040
now that's not sustainable for the whole
year,

1268
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,740
but what he does is when he's ramping up
for a big 200,

1269
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,500
200 plus mile race,
he does a marathon a day.

1270
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,370
Go to the opposite side then.
Do you know the story of marathon?

1271
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,353
Yes.
With a guy went to tell them of the 

1272
00:58:23,811 --> 00:58:24,610
victory and

1273
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:25,640
he died.
He died.

1274
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,340
He did the marathon that died.
That's who we do it after,

1275
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:32,640
but that guy was a pussy campaigns.
No training marathon.

1276
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,513
That's all.
That's the main message is not that you 

1277
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:36,614
should do marathons.
The message is the best way to kill 

1278
00:58:38,361 --> 00:58:41,420
pussies doesn't make him run marathons.
I've Read A.

1279
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:43,900
I've read sweating killed.

1280
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,870
I'm asked before and I liked that he.
I mean he's sincere and I get it,

1281
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,640
but he has to pretend to be impressed.

1282
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:57,650
People tell him I ran two miles today,
but he

1283
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,090
go,
hey brother,

1284
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:06,940
great job.
Even though he thinks six miles

1285
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,553
point blank,
what do you think of Bourbon in the 

1286
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:11,851
marathon?
He goes,

1287
00:59:11,851 --> 00:59:12,990
dude,
that's impressive.

1288
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,900
Too.
Cynical.

1289
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,390
Being cynical about a dude who wears 
cowboy boots.

1290
00:59:18,391 --> 00:59:21,350
Most of the days.
Don't be cynical.

1291
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:25,280
Campaigns is straight up.
I'm not cynical.

1292
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:30,370
I'm cynical and I'm saying that I read 
those comments and I lacked because he's

1293
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:31,394
like,
good job to the person that like I ran 

1294
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,610
around a 100 yards,
a guy.

1295
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,490
He's a good guy to me,
running a marathon.

1296
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,120
That's impressive.
Of course.

1297
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,520
It's a real impressive trying to tell 
you.

1298
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:48,110
He's one of my best friends.
The guys,

1299
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:48,944
the nicest guy in the world and he 
started out not being able to run for 

1300
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:52,754
shit.
He started out doing a mile and fucking 

1301
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:55,814
dying and going,
how the hell could anybody ever run a 

1302
00:59:57,531 --> 00:59:58,364
marathon?
And then he just kept doing it and then 

1303
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:00,860
he got to this point.

1304
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,590
We could run ultra marathons.
He runs 100 miles.

1305
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:04,424
You know why?
He would definitely think it's 

1306
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:08,540
impressive that you ran a marathon 
because he knows.

1307
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,430
He knows.
He knows.

1308
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:13,640
He knows running so well and he's run so
many.

1309
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:17,150
He knows what somebody who can run a 
marathon looks like,

1310
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:19,130
and then when he saw you,
he was like,

1311
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:24,600
that's fucking impossible stage.
And you go,

1312
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,730
how long did you do?
She goes,

1313
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,690
an hour.
You'd be like,

1314
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:31,950
what was really impressive?
If you know someone,

1315
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:34,964
they've been doing comedy for a year and
then they tell you they just did an 

1316
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:37,611
hour.
You're like,

1317
01:00:37,611 --> 01:00:38,750
wow,
that's impressive.

1318
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,300
But if you just got back from Memphis,
I go,

1319
01:00:41,301 --> 01:00:43,310
how much time do you do you go,
I did it now.

1320
01:00:43,311 --> 01:00:44,061
I go,
wow,

1321
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:44,960
that's impressive.

1322
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,170
Impressive.
What?

1323
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,033
But it is impressive.
If someone who's like maybe one of your 

1324
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:56,174
opening acts go does an hour,
15 minutes in Cleveland somewhere and 

1325
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,510
you're like,
dude,

1326
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,750
I killed.
It was awesome.

1327
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:06,080
Like if you tell me that you did that.
I'm like,

1328
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:09,470
yeah,
that's what you do.

1329
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:15,390
You're an asshole.
So I did an hour and you're like,

1330
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:16,784
wow,
look at you like you're a really a Dick 

1331
01:01:19,281 --> 01:01:24,281
for saying you act like you're positive.
Of course.

1332
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,610
Say if you had big.
Jay was like,

1333
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,230
I did an hour and Madison like,
Whoa,

1334
01:01:31,231 --> 01:01:31,900
wait,
hold on.

1335
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:36,900
It's our hour to an hour anymore because
I know a lot to lot to less.

1336
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:45,721
Lots.
Three,

1337
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:47,330
45,
3:42.

1338
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,520
When I first started at $45,
the number,

1339
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:54,700
it was 45.
Those are time comics from 5:30

1340
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:56,210
and 15,
15,

1341
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:57,044
30,
45,

1342
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:58,093
which is an hour and a half show,
which is most people what they think 

1343
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:00,704
their attention span is,
which is like honestly it's kind of 

1344
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:04,050
accurate.
I mean I,

1345
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:07,070
I think 45,
we're just too short to.

1346
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:11,420
Ours is pushing for people's attention.
So like I think a 90 minute show.

1347
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:16,090
I think our show is is right.
Well I think a 90 minute show I'm saying

1348
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:20,070
put everything is a great show.
Make the mistake

1349
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:20,903
of doing long sets where I did a lot of 
standup and it was rocking and rolling 

1350
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:28,480
for awhile and then I do like q and a's 
with people and would go on too long.

1351
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,473
You're going to agree.
I don't agree because I know for a fact 

1352
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:33,893
that like it's not right for me,
but for you a q and a will be 

1353
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,470
interesting.
Yeah.

1354
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:39,210
It wasn't that we wouldn't be 
interesting.

1355
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,253
It would be more interesting if people 
didn't see an hour and a half a comedy 

1356
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:45,000
first.
See if that's the problem.

1357
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:46,920
The problem is not whether or not it's 
good stuff.

1358
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:49,590
The problem is how much good stuff do 
you want all day long,

1359
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,453
which you want.
Nobody wants their Dick sucked eight 

1360
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:52,531
hours a day.
Like,

1361
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:54,560
stop.
I got to do things.

1362
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,100
You a counterpoint if you,
if you.

1363
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:59,850
If you did an hour and a really solid 
comedy and then was like,

1364
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,713
all right,
now we're going to do a q and a for 

1365
01:03:01,091 --> 01:03:01,500
awhile.

1366
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,980
It's gonna be different than me.
Well,

1367
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,500
you guys have bought your ticket for a 
show.

1368
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,020
It's like a whole festival that we got.
We did the stand up.

1369
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:08,560
Now let's have some fun time.
Dude.

1370
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,060
I think that.
I'll tell you what.

1371
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:15,230
I think the closer you are to 60.
If it's polished and good,

1372
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:19,530
that's the best you can hang on,
but we're.

1373
01:03:19,531 --> 01:03:21,360
None of us are all.
No,

1374
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:24,330
I'm not doing that right now.
I won't say I won't speak for everyone,

1375
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:27,300
but I'm not doing that right now in that
I'm working on my 60,

1376
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,870
so in order to work on my 60 I have to 
do because you're figuring it out,

1377
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:35,430
but that's the most of what we tour is 
not finished.

1378
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,443
It's not finished.
It's a work in progress is not that 60 

1379
01:03:39,351 --> 01:03:40,184
is the number that you shouldn't pass.
The idea is that like when you think 

1380
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:46,380
about it as a thing where people want to
see what you've got,

1381
01:03:46,381 --> 01:03:49,410
it locked down perfectly from start to 
finish.

1382
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:50,243
You really want an hour and a half and 
you want your opening acts to do at 

1383
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:54,660
least 20,
25 minutes,

1384
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,810
15,
15,

1385
01:03:57,811 --> 01:03:59,850
and then I take the rest of the time.
I did a two minute show.

1386
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,430
Nothing wrong with that,
but I like to bring headliners with me.

1387
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,500
Agreeing anybody,
any.

1388
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:07,290
You guys are welcome.
I bring Tony Hinchcliffe all the time.

1389
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,910
Ian Edwards.
Those guys are headlining.

1390
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:13,500
It is so funny.
The funniest motherfucker doing he is,

1391
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,393
I would say underrepresented central's 
comedy guy because he should be a 

1392
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:21,510
household fucking name.
I've been saying that forever,

1393
01:04:21,511 --> 01:04:22,800
man.
I started Tony.

1394
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,360
Tony's Wyoming to shit on.
No,

1395
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:29,361
I didn't mean to skip over to Ian since 
like 1993.

1396
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,680
We did a pauly shore thing in Miami and 
Brogan was like,

1397
01:04:34,681 --> 01:04:36,000
who are doing with.
I was like,

1398
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:36,710
Oh yeah,
I don't have.

1399
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,230
I was like,
wait,

1400
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,063
from what?
It was like 84 years started out 

1401
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:41,880
together.
Here's the thing about Ian,

1402
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,910
he's a.
he's a brilliant writer.

1403
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,023
He gets writing gigs on sitcoms and all 
these other different shows and one of 

1404
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,740
the things about writing gigs is first 
of all,

1405
01:04:52,741 --> 01:04:54,870
it's very convenient.
You don't have to go anywhere.

1406
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:58,350
He stay in town and you get paid a nice 
amount of money.

1407
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,420
You make good money.
It's hard to pass up on,

1408
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,793
but the problem is you're not out there 
building your name in different cities 

1409
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,520
and building up markets and you're not 
putting out a lot of comedy specials.

1410
01:05:08,521 --> 01:05:11,670
You only have one cd on team coco 
records.

1411
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:14,610
It's called 100 percent halfassed.
It's fucking hilarious,

1412
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:18,220
but really you got to see him live like 
his timing is

1413
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,650
fucking genius.
I've known that guy forever.

1414
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:21,783
He's the nicest fucking person you're 
ever gonna meet to what he has in his 

1415
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,430
job,
his job,

1416
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:33,190
because he's got so many haircuts sold 
as a person,

1417
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,000
half,
half.

1418
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,060
He couldn't be a better person.
Be a better person.

1419
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:38,380
Like I never had a problem.
You know?

1420
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:39,223
I like about him,
most of the person when you're riffing 

1421
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:41,794
jokes around a crowd and they rely on 
someone getting offended sometimes when 

1422
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:47,800
you say something horrible,
but since it's all comics,

1423
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:48,550
everyone's like,
Huh,

1424
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,930
yeah,
no one gets offended,

1425
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:54,390
but Ian is going to be like that.
It's out there like,

1426
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,360
Oh yes,
I need that.

1427
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:00,660
You know?
He and I did a lot of gigs together.

1428
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:06,070
We did a lot of gigs together,
sexual special garment of all my gigs,

1429
01:06:06,071 --> 01:06:06,904
getting ready for my last Netflix 
special world with Ian or with Tony and 

1430
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,310
a couple with Santino.

1431
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:13,623
He's great.
He knows a motherfuckers on a mother 

1432
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:17,933
fucker.
I liked so much about the shoes he was 

1433
01:06:19,691 --> 01:06:22,600
wearing too.
These guys are coming up,

1434
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:23,434
man.
Tony Hinchcliffe was murdering it to to 

1435
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:27,640
kill.
Tony is legit.

1436
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:29,680
A sellout show.
It's a legitimate.

1437
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:33,150
She put 15 people in the room,
him and wrap him.

1438
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:34,263
Dude,
they are selling out everywhere they 

1439
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:37,870
fucking go and brilliant idea.
First of all,

1440
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:41,360
Tony is,
he's so good at roasting,

1441
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,363
so I'm good at that kind of shit.
That kind of situation where someone 

1442
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:49,870
might be with some of bombs and does one
minute and he's a little murderer.

1443
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:50,733
Dude.
He makes me blush sitting next to next 

1444
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,833
to him and a light someone up and you 
hit them and you go three steps behind 

1445
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:01,270
you.
Oh,

1446
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,650
you already said that one.
Oh yeah,

1447
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,180
yeah,
yeah.

1448
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:08,180
I feel I feel it down my back when he 
starts fucking good show.

1449
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,730
The format is so genius.
Perfect mix.

1450
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,040
They do one minute at the end of the 
minute.

1451
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,230
Redband gives him a meow.
Like time's up bitch.

1452
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:21,640
Fucking fucked.
The whole combination is great.

1453
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:23,040
Jeremiah Watkins,
Jeremiah,

1454
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:27,000
Jeremiah.
Fucking multi,

1455
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:29,710
half fat.
Half an it happened in fast.

1456
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,320
Whatever the fuck that one.
Jeremiah is a fuck.

1457
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:35,500
He's all over the map.
Joe Rogan.

1458
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:37,450
Hilarious.
He's so funny.

1459
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:38,950
Okay,
so when did this change?

1460
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:40,143
When things change?
Right now we're talking about comics 

1461
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,190
that back in the day when we were coming
up,

1462
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,053
no one ever gave us props for being 
funny and young and right now when did 

1463
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:50,950
that change in stand up where everyone 
was like.

1464
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:54,430
It became a community where I wanted the
people see people succeed.

1465
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:56,030
Yeah.
When I came up I felt those,

1466
01:07:56,070 --> 01:08:01,070
this weird unnecessary competition 
between people because I had come from a

1467
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,070
world of competition,
so I was like,

1468
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:04,690
why are you guys pretending you're 
competing?

1469
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:05,913
You're not competing like you just like 
there's a few people that are going to 

1470
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:10,924
get certain roles and things,
but the way to look at it correctly was 

1471
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:15,680
not that you're competing.
The way they look at it correctly,

1472
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:16,400
in my

1473
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,500
estimation was that we're helping each 
other.

1474
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,920
Like when I see you,
when I say you kill,

1475
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:22,933
I get inspired.
I see some new bit that's like really 

1476
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,750
well crafted and and and hits me and 
surprises me.

1477
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,250
I get inspired and I think that that 
when you see comics in a vacuum,

1478
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,970
like I remember when I was coming up,
I would go in these weird tours.

1479
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:38,953
We do a weird show and some weird town.
They had a local scene and the local 

1480
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:44,810
scene was almost always hacky.
Like there's a few scenes that were,

1481
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:47,680
weren't Hacky,
like Houston wasn't hacky there.

1482
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,210
They had a lot of pride and not being 
hacky.

1483
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,000
Boston was very,
not hacky New Yorkers on Hacky,

1484
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,670
but Florida was hacking.
Right.

1485
01:08:55,671 --> 01:08:58,340
There's a few places.
There's a few places like that.

1486
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,570
By the way.
What I realized what it was like,

1487
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,473
oh,
they don't have anybody good that 

1488
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:04,250
they're around.

1489
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,850
And I remember how bad I was when I 
first started,

1490
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,720
how hacky my ideas were,
how shitty they were,

1491
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:16,990
but I got lucky that I was around guys 
like Lenny Clarke and Barry crimmins and

1492
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,620
you know,
and then after that wave it was Louis,

1493
01:09:20,621 --> 01:09:23,340
c,
k and Mark Marin and there was an,

1494
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:24,613
there was all these guys that nobody 
ever heard of that were really good but 

1495
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:31,390
super ethical about their material and 
like really sharp about you.

1496
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,130
You're broke the fuck meter.
You said fuck too much.

1497
01:09:34,131 --> 01:09:36,530
Like when you say it,
it ruins it for everybody.

1498
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:39,710
Like they would explain like comedy 
theory too.

1499
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:44,100
That was like really high level stuff 
that I remember thinking like,

1500
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,830
why doesn't everybody just do that for 
everybody?

1501
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:48,410
Like all over the place.
Like what?

1502
01:09:48,411 --> 01:09:53,411
Why does everybody like treat this as if
there's like a famine situation going on

1503
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,060
and there's a small amount of comedy 
fans,

1504
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,133
no bitch,
you can't be in Cleveland every night 

1505
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,550
and I'm going to be in Denver and you're
going to be in Detroit.

1506
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,130
We're supposed to support each other.
This is so stupid.

1507
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,323
We're the only people that understand 
each other in terms of like what a 

1508
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:12,640
bizarre human being it takes to be 
onstage or broken windows,

1509
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:15,680
broken spotlight,
talking shit.

1510
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,270
People will know how to do it.
So what was the change?

1511
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,590
The change is the Internet.
This is why,

1512
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:23,480
because before the internet,
everybody was like,

1513
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:24,523
I want to be the next host that's 
tonight show and Jay Leno retires and 

1514
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,120
um,
the next cone and,

1515
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:28,954
but I'm on cable.
Everybody had this idea of being one 

1516
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,430
person who stood out in a limited amount
of slots.

1517
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,443
And then the internet came around and no
longer was there a limited amount of 

1518
01:10:38,031 --> 01:10:40,210
splott slots instead,
if you.

1519
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,113
It's hard to remember.
But when I first started doing the 

1520
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,713
acting shit,
it's hard to remember what it was like 

1521
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:49,610
back then.
No Internet and everything was on either

1522
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:51,200
NBC,
ABC,

1523
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:52,520
CBS,
or Fox.

1524
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:55,640
That was it.
And there's a few like vh one.

1525
01:10:55,641 --> 01:10:57,320
MTV things.
It was famine,

1526
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,273
but they can choose.
There's also one person or one of 20 

1527
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:03,140
people who say,
yes,

1528
01:11:03,141 --> 01:11:03,974
you're in.
Yep.

1529
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:06,680
And then that's it.
Either you're in or or you're not.

1530
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:11,710
And this was for MTV and this was for 
Hbo Comedy Specials and this was for all

1531
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:14,040
these things and it was in that.
The

1532
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,130
people that got through were very high 
quality sometimes.

1533
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:20,010
Sometimes a lot of them,
if you look back at the comics,

1534
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:22,320
that become,
became big off hbo.

1535
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:23,860
They have the best record.
Yeah.

1536
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:24,600
Hbo,
Yeah.

1537
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,430
Of all time.
If you add a judge,

1538
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,550
Chris rock had HBO special.
Louis C,

1539
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,393
k.
I mean Carlin Carlin had one a year for 

1540
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:40,610
how long they you put out?
16 for anyone could ever see it again.

1541
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:45,480
Impossible to comprehend.
He did a new hour every year

1542
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,850
and I would.
I went to one.

1543
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:47,713
I got to see him run the either the last
one or the second to last one at the 

1544
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:53,810
store.
No fucking I wish.

1545
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,673
And he was,
and he would run it always the night 

1546
01:11:55,731 --> 01:11:56,564
before,
I learned later at comedy and Magic 

1547
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:59,870
Club,
which I live nearby for awhile,

1548
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:01,063
but he got to see him do it at universal
amphitheatre when that was still a 

1549
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:06,740
thing.
And for his closing bit,

1550
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,070
he had it written down and he told the 
6,000

1551
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,940
person audience he's working at like it 
was a fucking 80 person room.

1552
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:16,340
He told 6,400
people.

1553
01:12:16,341 --> 01:12:18,230
He's like,
this is how I remember this shit.

1554
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:19,700
I got to fucking read it.
Right?

1555
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:23,480
So then he read the whole last bit 
because it was really wordy.

1556
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,100
Oh right.
I was like a monologue.

1557
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,200
And he was like,
this is how I ended up memorizing this.

1558
01:12:27,201 --> 01:12:28,580
So you guys are gonna.
Listen to fucking read it.

1559
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,070
I got to see him on the court.
He would.

1560
01:12:31,071 --> 01:12:31,904
This is what he would do.
He would write a new monologue 

1561
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,423
essentially,
and it would tighten up a little bit 

1562
01:12:35,631 --> 01:12:36,700
over the course of the year.
I've,

1563
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,140
I've thought this was a dog the whole 
time for some reason.

1564
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:40,640
So what is it?
Just a cord?

1565
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:42,850
I thought it was a dog.
And I was losing my leg.

1566
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,220
They really are.
I was like,

1567
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:46,063
oh,
that's a nice dog.

1568
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:46,903
As it was my thought.
Really thought there was a dog in a 

1569
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:49,010
second.
I did.

1570
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:51,730
And then I just realized that was a rat.
He just so calm.

1571
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:54,620
Freak out my house because our cat 
brings rats in the house.

1572
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,840
Isn't it funny that were so racist 
against rats,

1573
01:12:56,841 --> 01:12:59,870
but yet girls get a free pass,
a squirrel on the house.

1574
01:12:59,871 --> 01:13:02,290
I'm trying to put a net over it and 
bring the little fellow outside.

1575
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,790
There is a rat.
I'm trying to kill everybody that's ever

1576
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:05,624
met before the fucker.
Someone said the only there was between 

1577
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:13,960
squirrels and rats are their tails.
And that's not totally true because rats

1578
01:13:13,961 --> 01:13:14,794
carry playing.
And that's why we have an apprehension 

1579
01:13:15,921 --> 01:13:18,830
about them to go fuck himself with a 
shitty advice.

1580
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,270
Scrolls forever.
Yo.

1581
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:23,220
Fuck off.
World's team.

1582
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:26,280
Squirrels on what were we just talking 
about month?

1583
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,870
Here's one thing that did happen to me.
I want to tell you guys,

1584
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,900
this was over this month,
freak you out.

1585
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:34,520
Like when it was over,
when it was all said and done,

1586
01:13:34,521 --> 01:13:37,190
like November second,
maybe I woke up and I'm like,

1587
01:13:37,191 --> 01:13:38,024
what the fuck just happened?
How did I go from living this like 

1588
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:44,960
completely normal life of podcast 
guests?

1589
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:48,860
You have cj to being involved in this 
fucking insane battle to the death.

1590
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:50,111
Yeah.
I mean,

1591
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:52,220
you know what else,
what else occurred to me is like,

1592
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,073
this probably doesn't occur to you 
because of your history with working 

1593
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:56,164
out.
But I had that exciting but 

1594
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:01,240
disappointing thought of like,
wow,

1595
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:02,163
you know,
I can't believe how much I was able to 

1596
01:14:03,641 --> 01:14:04,720
do.
Oh,

1597
01:14:04,721 --> 01:14:07,030
I can't believe how much I'm able to do 
and don't,

1598
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,110
don't.
Yeah.

1599
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,020
And that's like the last five years,
that's like a Merman.

1600
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,250
Right?

1601
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,560
To me it was,
I was like,

1602
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:17,200
I could be doing a lot more than these.
Do you want to be doing a lot more?

1603
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,990
I don't think the key to be.
It's definitely not.

1604
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,003
It's definitely not to do what we did.
If I could get there for an hour of 

1605
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:27,730
running and an hour of weights twice a 
week,

1606
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,200
I'd be like this amazing ahead of the 
curb.

1607
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:33,010
Great.
That's health.

1608
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,870
Yeah.
I mean a good number.

1609
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,620
How many?
Two d?

1610
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:39,490
Two days of two hours.
Two days to 40.

1611
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:40,570
Five minutes.
Forty five minutes.

1612
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:41,870
Two days.
I do too.

1613
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:46,740
You know,
it's a bad idea for days.

1614
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,590
At half hour.
Wait,

1615
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:54,250
what are we talking about this for?
Just a half an hour.

1616
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,140
Yes.
No,

1617
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:55,440
no,
no,

1618
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,273
no.
This changed my whole fucking way of 

1619
01:14:57,081 --> 01:14:59,320
looking at working out.
This is what I gotta do an hour,

1620
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:02,990
but you can certainly can or if you're 
being Tom,

1621
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:03,913
you do.

1622
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:08,650
You can do on our hard.
You could do half an hour hard.

1623
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,900
There's A.
There's a DVD that I follow.

1624
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:15,310
It's called the kettlebell extreme 
cardio workout by this Guy Keith Weber,

1625
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:16,144
who's a past guest.
Does the dude that is by himself in a 

1626
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:22,330
fucking room.
He says a couple different variations,

1627
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:24,340
but one of them he did on a beach.
It's the one he did.

1628
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,160
He just takes a 35 pound kettle bell and
you're like,

1629
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:29,590
how hard could this be?
Thirty five pounds is not heavy,

1630
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,910
but you do it for 40 minutes.
Forty minutes with that,

1631
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:36,040
without putting it down to one of those 
tests.

1632
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,690
Yes.
Tommy,

1633
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:40,540
give you a little breaks.
Bought this.

1634
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:43,180
I bought this because of this mother 
fucker going dark.

1635
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:46,180
It's impossible.
It's impossible.

1636
01:15:46,181 --> 01:15:47,440
But here's the thing.
After it's over,

1637
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:49,660
I could barely walk,
can barely walk.

1638
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:54,661
I was hobbled to my hamstrings and my 
quads were destroyed,

1639
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:55,863
but I did the second to last day I did 
15 minute rounds with a guy with myths 

1640
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:00,590
up and down,
down.

1641
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:01,743
You can see other people's stuff.
You'll see some yellow with the yellow 

1642
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:05,203
white stay above 80.
What did you think about when you were 

1643
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,593
doing it?
I thought about I was trying to get my 

1644
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:12,430
legs a rest and then uh,
so,

1645
01:16:12,431 --> 01:16:13,960
so that was what prompted me to start 
it.

1646
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:16,660
And then when I would do,
when it was doing it,

1647
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:21,010
I would just think about points and burt
and then I would just point where it was

1648
01:16:21,011 --> 01:16:23,220
a great motivator.
Motivator.

1649
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,500
Just one little,
just heads up,

1650
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:29,320
seriously ahead,
so you're welcome everybody,

1651
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,693
because all of you were beating me and 
there was a part of me that definitely 

1652
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:34,924
felt very alone.
That's not true because I never thought 

1653
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,350
you could ever beat me.
It wasn't.

1654
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:43,990
Here's what I was doing.
Here's what I was doing.

1655
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,153
What I was doing was punishing you 
because I wanted to take you on a dark 

1656
01:16:50,051 --> 01:16:50,884
dark

1657
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,650
of all of them,

1658
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,590
your insecurities and all of your 
thoughts of mortality.

1659
01:16:56,591 --> 01:16:57,950
I wanted to take you into a place

1660
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,593
you could never travel.
We're going to go to the bottom of the 

1661
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:04,800
ocean.
Motherfucker.

1662
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:07,860
As soon as I saw these numbers

1663
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:10,040
and uh,
and you're saying going to do double,

1664
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,880
I went,
okay.

1665
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:16,210
And I told you I didn't get me mad.
You didn't get me mad,

1666
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,970
but you,
you made me open up the door to the dark

1667
01:17:19,971 --> 01:17:21,350
place.
First of all,

1668
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,450
you realize that when I was doing the 
videos,

1669
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:26,810
they were all for comedy of fact.
I understand,

1670
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:29,390
but that doesn't matter to me when I'm 
in competition with.

1671
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,160
I did the video where I go,
Joe,

1672
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:32,660
I saw your numbers.
I'm doubling them.

1673
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,350
I came up with my dog and then I 
pretended to lose my dog.

1674
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:38,450
Everyone thought that was real.
I was like,

1675
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:41,880
my dogs had five knee surgery.
She definitely can like the canyon.

1676
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,780
That was so funny because he definitely 
knew you were joking,

1677
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,660
but he was like,
I don't care.

1678
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:53,080
Just in serve me to think that you're 
joking serves me right.

1679
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:58,580
It serves me to take you very seriously 
and to take her to the dark place.

1680
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:02,120
I'll tell you what,
I heard you talked to Nikki glaser.

1681
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,560
I heard that and I was like,
what?

1682
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:11,910
I was trying to kill burt.
He goes a week after she was here in di.

1683
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,070
Just put it.
I hope it doesn't die.

1684
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,330
You did not say.
That's how I felt.

1685
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:22,200
I hope this can be my new favorite clip.
What is,

1686
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,150
but I should just be really clear.
We are right after bird his head.

1687
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:31,250
He's going to double my score.
Right,

1688
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:34,440
and I'm like,
you're fired up by this.

1689
01:18:34,441 --> 01:18:35,360
This is.
Hold on,

1690
01:18:35,361 --> 01:18:36,280
hold on,
hold on.

1691
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,520
Listen,
listen.

1692
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:43,910
Listen to him.
There's not a part of you that respected

1693
01:18:43,911 --> 01:18:48,230
the conor mcgregor.
Dare you compare yourself.

1694
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,630
Hold on.
Greatest mixed martial arts.

1695
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:55,631
You have all part of the entire nation.
You know conor Mcgregor,

1696
01:18:58,850 --> 01:18:59,683
you know how many people can you and can
I say that whoever the fuck is in 

1697
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:05,744
Ireland,
what were the connor would love bird 

1698
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,153
fucking.

1699
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:10,383
If you said Connor,
you got one hour to party with one 

1700
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,750
hanging out with one guy.
He's picking me Bro.

1701
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:20,620
Shit ain't asked me if I would like to 
talk to them about a teacher.

1702
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,780
I have some thoughts.
I want him on your podcast.

1703
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:26,590
So bad man.
I Dunno.

1704
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,800
We're supposed to do it a long time ago.
I had his trainer on really recently,

1705
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:31,903
you know,
I hope he doesn't think that in any way 

1706
01:19:34,431 --> 01:19:39,410
that I don't respect him or appreciated 
him because fighters are like super,

1707
01:19:39,411 --> 01:19:42,050
super sensitive.
Like I've gone through that a few times.

1708
01:19:42,051 --> 01:19:45,470
Like I called Tony Ferguson who's like 
one of my all time favorite.

1709
01:19:45,471 --> 01:19:47,390
Literally one of my all time favorite 
fighters.

1710
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,980
I said he was a brilliant Weirdo because
he wears like ankle weights.

1711
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:52,883
When he got mad at me,
he got upset and I had to talk to him 

1712
01:19:56,121 --> 01:19:56,954
and I try to sort it out.
I did it through someone else and I was 

1713
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:01,034
like,
what?

1714
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,010
No,
no,

1715
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:03,240
no,
no,

1716
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,850
no.
Like that.

1717
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:08,140
It seems like that,
but what it is is so

1718
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:12,600
exposed.
It's what you're doing is so personal.

1719
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:16,410
It's so insane that you like what we can
brush off.

1720
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,900
It's way harder for them.
What will you.

1721
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,833
If you lose a fight and someone 
disrespects you or they they in public 

1722
01:20:24,631 --> 01:20:27,140
sentiment keeps you from getting a title
shot like that.

1723
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,250
So that's a significant part of their 
life.

1724
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,340
They're not used to dealing with public 
reaction.

1725
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,350
They used to dealing with his 
competition.

1726
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,140
So the public reaction thing of 
celebrity.

1727
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:38,213
It's an afterthought.
It's something an after effect of 

1728
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:40,860
competition,
right?

1729
01:20:40,861 --> 01:20:41,694
You become successful.
Then you have to deal with all these 

1730
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:44,880
people around you.
They want you to dance.

1731
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:45,580
Well,
economy,

1732
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:49,260
Mcgregor's and natural shit talker.
He's a great fighter,

1733
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:53,190
but he's also a natural shit talker.
You want a buffalo bar?

1734
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:53,960
Yeah,

1735
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,510
Dude.
That's what I love about conor Mcgregor.

1736
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,580
Conor mcgregor,
Bernie Sanders on.

1737
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,103
That's it's a weird situation that you 
haven't had either one of those people 

1738
01:21:01,031 --> 01:21:02,650
aren't.
I tried to get Bernie recently.

1739
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:05,380
He said no,
some fake Bernie contacted us.

1740
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,880
Oh,
you say you got your hat,

1741
01:21:06,881 --> 01:21:07,210
right?
Yeah.

1742
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:07,570
Yeah.
I was.

1743
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:09,100
Had.
They got me and I said,

1744
01:21:09,101 --> 01:21:11,110
I'm a big fan of like a lot of your 
ideas.

1745
01:21:11,111 --> 01:21:11,944
I'd love to have you on.
And then it was really not commodity 

1746
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:14,163
here though.
I don't think he wants to run for 

1747
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:17,920
president man.
Why would he show his ideas?

1748
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:19,003
I don't know man.
You know what I fucking love by the way 

1749
01:21:20,531 --> 01:21:21,364
about conor mcgregor is that he meets.
He made me really appreciate the 

1750
01:21:25,031 --> 01:21:28,660
athlete.
Who knows they're also an entertainer.

1751
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,100
Yeah.
I actually,

1752
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,000
you know,
there's,

1753
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:31,833
there's people that did that like,
I mean everyone would probably give 

1754
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,650
credit to know why it works.

1755
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:40,740
I don't know why that's who he is.
We'll be talking shit and sparring.

1756
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:41,923
Just guys that are just funny.
Locked on him is fantastic and he's 

1757
01:21:44,531 --> 01:21:46,390
smoking weed.
Had Mike Tyson by the way.

1758
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:50,290
Mike Tyson owns a god damn weed farm.
What is it called now?

1759
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:51,340
Yeah,
what is it called?

1760
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,620
Jamie?
Make that smaller place so we could read

1761
01:21:53,621 --> 01:21:58,540
what the Hashtag is.
I'm used to God.

1762
01:21:58,600 --> 01:21:59,433
Damn.
They used to say something about Tyson 

1763
01:22:01,721 --> 01:22:03,700
something or another.
Did they edit it?

1764
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,320
I didn't see it on there earlier.
I look.

1765
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:08,100
Huh?
He's fun.

1766
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,200
He has some sort of company.
They're growing weed.

1767
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,900
Mike Tyson's growing weed.
That's wild,

1768
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,263
right?

1769
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,440
It's really tricky about the UFC because
I love Mike Tyson was building a 40 acre

1770
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:24,850
wheat farm.
Bam.

1771
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:26,450
Oh,
cabinets will be there.

1772
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,080
Is that in Nevada,
California?

1773
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:35,650
She kept California.
Just do that,

1774
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:39,140
but I do have to tell you,
I just read the first one.

1775
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,370
Boxer,
Oxford and rapist.

1776
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:42,243
My clients say that.
It does say that it does that really 

1777
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:53,130
mean person.
Root stock come bro.

1778
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:03,170
Seriously Bro,
I made to open your article here.

1779
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:05,643
You.
Oh,

1780
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:08,710
all bullshit aside.
There has to be some way.

1781
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:11,230
That's crazy.
It's crazy.

1782
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:15,220
There has to be some way for people to 
bounce back from horrible things.

1783
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,810
Right?
He did.

1784
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:18,370
He did.
He definitely did.

1785
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,970
He would be like front and center.
Very buried in it.

1786
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,890
Like dude,
I met Marion bearing on the open,

1787
01:23:24,891 --> 01:23:26,530
the Anthony Show.
Yeah,

1788
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:28,450
that's right.
And as soon as he came in,

1789
01:23:28,451 --> 01:23:29,890
I started asking them about crack.

1790
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:30,783
You just went straight at him.
We were all staring at him and Joe was 

1791
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,873
like,
oh.

1792
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:39,640
My thought was like I had someone 
trapped in the corner.

1793
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,290
Like I had a,
like a,

1794
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,143
like a wounded thing in corner just in a
hallway looking for his next interview 

1795
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:49,810
and Norton rundown here and come on in 
here with us.

1796
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,620
I just brought him in.
They,

1797
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:52,960
I like,
he's going to run,

1798
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:54,620
he's Kinda run.
Would you say to him,

1799
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,680
I said,
I said,

1800
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:56,860
I said,
did you smoke?

1801
01:23:56,861 --> 01:23:58,350
Crack it?
No,

1802
01:23:58,351 --> 01:23:58,701
no,
no,

1803
01:23:58,701 --> 01:23:59,110
no,
no.

1804
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:00,480
And I asked him about that.
What you said.

1805
01:24:00,481 --> 01:24:03,550
You said what a testimony to the 
American spirit you are,

1806
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:04,683
that you can come back from all these 
things and managed to like reclaim 

1807
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:11,560
yourself and become mayor again of men,
of,

1808
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:12,453
of uh,
of Washington dc despite everything he 

1809
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:16,240
went through yet.
And he goes,

1810
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:16,750
what?

1811
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,430
I go through.
That's right.

1812
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:19,900
And he said,
that's when he said,

1813
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,490
he said,
no one knows this in that pipe.

1814
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,440
I go,
what did you say to me?

1815
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,540
No one knows smoke crack,
smoke,

1816
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:28,383
crack.
No one was.

1817
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:31,420
No one else was in that Bible.
He didn't even say didn't smoke crack.

1818
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:34,990
I think he'd already realized legalees 
at that point.

1819
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:38,810
So I don't think he said.
Did he say I didn't Smell Peter?

1820
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:41,650
Who didn't know?
I think he said no one knows what was in

1821
01:24:41,651 --> 01:24:42,484
that pipe.
Yeah,

1822
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:43,600
yeah.
No,

1823
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:46,510
no.
This is some Jujitsu.

1824
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:51,320
You just get under hooks on that are 
frozen pipe.

1825
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,990
Joe said,
well,

1826
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:56,550
what did you think you were smoking when
you smoke?

1827
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:57,443
Whatever was lit it up.
What did you think was going to be 

1828
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:03,783
there?
I knew we had took off where you left 

1829
01:25:05,111 --> 01:25:05,944
off.
That's what he's like,

1830
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:06,930
Eh,
you got me.

1831
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:07,823
Good.
Well player,

1832
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:12,070
we had to get them quick.
You got to get this guy quick.

1833
01:25:12,071 --> 01:25:17,071
This guy's kind of try to do a Tina.
I'm here to say hi to DC and house.

1834
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,040
Thank you very much.
Vote for me.

1835
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,470
Yeah.
Hi.

1836
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:25,450
Come and say hi and bolt.
So I just had to grab them.

1837
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:29,770
Can I say this?
That I got a letter when we registered,

1838
01:25:29,771 --> 01:25:30,670
I was like,
I don't know how to do.

1839
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,770
I was so mad about doing this thing in 
the first place.

1840
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,293
I didn't want to get talked to the sober
October again and then we call me to do 

1841
01:25:39,091 --> 01:25:40,120
it next year.
No.

1842
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,073
Yes,
no.

1843
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,290
Wait a minute.
Was there any.

1844
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,570
Is there any penalty for this about.
Hold on a second.

1845
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,850
I know everyone,
so everyone's.

1846
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:51,160
Let me pee.
Pee.

1847
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:52,630
You gotta drink piss.
He let me.

1848
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:58,930
That recovery.
We appeal to your fiscal sensibilities.

1849
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:03,470
What if next year we got a sponsor?
Like I just want to tell you guys,

1850
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:07,250
this is like one of the most popular 
podcast we've ever done by far.

1851
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,113
It is this whole series of podcasts are 
doing from the weight loss podcast to 

1852
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:11,984
last year sober October to this.
Why would you call it weight loss fat 

1853
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:19,500
challenge podcasts?
I'm trying.

1854
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,310
Positive Bro.
Thank you man.

1855
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:23,550
Be Body positive yoga man.
Sure.

1856
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,160
Curve is exactly where it's supposed to 
be.

1857
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:33,850
This US competing random points either 
like every quarter.

1858
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:35,631
Okay.
But you guys,

1859
01:26:35,631 --> 01:26:37,310
here's what's your greatest show of all 
time.

1860
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:38,570
That's not going to happen.
I'm busy.

1861
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:43,460
You're busy to quarter.
Once a year would be a fucking holiday.

1862
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,500
What's he is?
We invent our own holiday.

1863
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,080
Okay.
But you guys listen.

1864
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,710
I understand.
I know what it's like.

1865
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:49,603
You have babies.

1866
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:51,740
It's okay because your life to other 
things.

1867
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:52,893
But I have fun.
All legitimately be doing fucking 

1868
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,000
November.
December,

1869
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:06,680
January,
February.

1870
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:10,100
So you're in.
This is ridiculous.

1871
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:15,870
No one else in my life.
My life.

1872
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,620
Mine too.
You were great this year.

1873
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,650
You did great job Bro.
You did a great job.

1874
01:27:21,651 --> 01:27:25,520
I took the last day off.
You could have fucking 4,200

1875
01:27:25,521 --> 01:27:27,110
points.
He uh,

1876
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:28,340
he told me,
he was like,

1877
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:33,580
well you just got the last detail.
You just fucking sink up and just let me

1878
01:27:35,691 --> 01:27:36,950
know if I have to get back on the 
treadmill.

1879
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:37,851
Hold on,
hold on,

1880
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:39,800
hold on.
You guys were all talking independently,

1881
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:43,100
so just talking to the group here or 
there.

1882
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:45,450
This was last day.
Last 700.

1883
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:48,350
Everyone against me.
Hey,

1884
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:53,090
give me another cocktail.
Daytime dates out of workout.

1885
01:27:53,091 --> 01:27:53,924
I'll have that one.
It's Japanese stuff that's from todd

Scottish.

1888
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,043
They get all mad about it.

By the way,

I go to your mom's house whenever I want
to know what kind of weird nonsense is 

1898
01:28:33,861 --> 01:28:36,740
floating around the Internet.
Who's eating shit?

1899

Already.

What are you doing?
Okay.

1909

That's good.
Thank you.

1910
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,310

Cheers.
Cheers.

1915
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,900
Cheers.
Cheers.

1916
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:31,710
It was awful.
Guys.

1917
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:34,260
Why would we not drink during October?
Doing it again?

1918
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:39,680
Stupid.
Is it a New York City thing?

1919
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,260
You've got to understand what it's like 
there.

1920
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:44,430
It's the best month to drink in New 
York.

1921
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,280
I would walk by bars and longingly 
going,

1922
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:50,400
I want to go in there now.
I don't know what that feels like.

1923
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:52,980
The whiskey is good.
Did you really turn 53?

1924
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:54,300
Shut up.
Wow.

1925
01:29:54,301 --> 01:29:56,490
Brad,
you and your fake news.

1926
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,190
Hey,
will you say bird is 53?

1927
01:29:59,410 --> 01:29:59,821
No,
no,

1928
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:00,091
no,
no,

1929
01:30:00,091 --> 01:30:00,391
no,
no,

1930
01:30:00,391 --> 01:30:01,224
no,
no.

1931
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:02,040
Well,
you know,

1932
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,020
I'm lying.
Bernice,

1933
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:05,930
for Joe.
Burdens burdens 53rd.

1934
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:09,600
Meanwhile these guys,
I'm 51.

1935
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,070
I know.
That's crazy.

1936
01:30:11,071 --> 01:30:13,180
He's two years older than you.
That's not set.

1937
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,230
Bird is down 50.

1938
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:20,460
They changed his birthday and wikipedia 
and everything.

1939
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,550
Who's going to win this Arrow when the 
surf challenge next year,

1940
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,800
because we're going deep.
We're taking the month off.

1941
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:30,120
How many have you lost?
Now?

1942
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:33,900
Challenges.
This is a second,

1943
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,320
but here's what's important.
When nobody.

1944
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:37,283
Nobody lost.
I couldn't believe they already put it 

1945
01:30:44,941 --> 01:30:46,120
on.
Your computer is off.

1946
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:51,480
You can suck my Dick.
Do you understand what kind of fake news

1947
01:30:51,481 --> 01:30:53,380
you're dishing out?
Oh,

1948
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,790
you guys have to wish Berta happy.
Fifty third birthday.

1949
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,650
The other day was yesterday.
Was it yesterday?

1950
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:02,303
Two days ago to make me feel bad because
I'm 24 months away from what you're 

1951
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:08,220
making now,
but.

1952
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:11,800
But it's already doing.
When I say I'm 51 is that.

1953
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:13,470
First of all,
that's insane.

1954
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:16,590
But you realize when you're 53 
[inaudible] 55.

1955
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,640
Oh.
Also other people were happy about that.

1956
01:31:23,641 --> 01:31:24,474
They're like,
it looks good.

1957
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:26,940
You Dude,
I can't control it.

1958
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:30,690
I cannot control fake news.
You try to because you're like,

1959
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:32,310
hey man,
I'm not the fattest comic ever.

1960
01:31:32,311 --> 01:31:34,470
Performing status.
Spread some stuff about you.

1961
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:37,360
Oh no shit.
You fucking aspect.

1962
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:38,730
What'd you spread about them?
Nothing.

1963
01:31:38,731 --> 01:31:43,110
Everything you said was just reported,
fastened on necessarily bad.

1964
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:47,490
If you got all your bases covered,
so much weight and still managed to have

1965
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:51,770
that belly,
it doesn't make sense to lead a skit.

1966
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:55,630
That mickey mantle gene crazy.
Stop saying that again.

1967
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,080
Double down.
Double down.

1968
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,100
What I loved,
what I loved about tour by

1969
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:00,933
the way,
will validate the Mickey Mantle gene 

1970
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:06,560
because birds tour is like 10 shows a 
week back to back weeks me.

1971
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:11,370
It's a real Mickey Mantle Shit.
A lot of shows where it's like,

1972
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,213
I don't want to just lose my family.
I want to drive them away completely to 

1973
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:15,423
what I was thinking about.
How much fun would you have had a back 

1974
01:32:17,651 --> 01:32:18,484
in the day?
I really think standup was totally 

1975
01:32:19,691 --> 01:32:23,410
globally different.
If you were on the road with Joey Diaz,

1976
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:27,040
Ari Shaffir red band in a tour bus,
it had to be more fun.

1977
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:28,053
Oh,
you guys would've had a fucking insane 

1978
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:33,160
time.
Did we had so much fun for bus so we had

1979
01:32:33,161 --> 01:32:36,760
so much fun I've never had of before.
I don't need it to bring more fun.

1980
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:42,090
Never hit a blunt.
You don't know like Ari and Joey and red

1981
01:32:42,131 --> 01:32:45,730
band and Dunkin,
like the road trips that we went on,

1982
01:32:45,731 --> 01:32:48,340
the fund that we had,
we didn't need more fun.

1983
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:49,343
No,
we just needed to appreciate what was 

1984
01:32:50,891 --> 01:32:52,300
happening.
What was happening.

1985
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,620
We had with no one.
I'm good.

1986
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:59,900
Damn,
no one wants to drink.

1987
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:05,840
Do you want one tell you I feel.
Where were you being cited in the uh,

1988
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,490
I did the bus this weekend.
Yeah,

1989
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,240
I fucking loved it.
I love the bus.

1990
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,670
I did.
I liked it a lot on accident,

1991
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:13,940
son.
I've been.

1992
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:16,090
Can we change subject?
Not in a bus.

1993
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,170
Pretty common.
Yeah.

1994
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:19,210
The plane crashes.
Oh cool.

1995
01:33:19,211 --> 01:33:19,720
Cool.
Cool.

1996
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:20,553
I know you're fucking with light tanks.
You know when you drive around looking 

1997
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:27,290
diner seat,
you're not wearing a seatbelt.

1998
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,143
Bitch.
That's true.

1999
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:31,870
Cool.
Miles an hour down the highway.

2000
01:33:31,871 --> 01:33:33,920
No seat belt.
The fucking 80,000.

2001
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:38,620
But you'll just run through shit.
Bodyshots world tour every tour bus from

2002
01:33:38,621 --> 01:33:39,454
January till April.
She would feel like if you listen to my 

2003
01:33:42,671 --> 01:33:46,780
voice and you heard it in your head,
the moment your face was hitting the lcd

2004
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:47,733
screen,
that would suck the moment you were 

2005
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:52,720
flying towards this screening.
I remember this moment.

2006
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:55,720
I didn't know that was going on.
Dude.

2007
01:33:55,750 --> 01:34:00,750
Just fucking take the day off and fly a 
lot of it.

2008
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:05,890
But you're looking at me.
I'm the one doing most of the time.

2009
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:07,510
You're not going to craft.
That sounds pretty awesome.

2010
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,200
Joe.
Come out on the road with me.

2011
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,780
Listen,
bus.

2012
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:15,670
God.
Goddamn stadium tour boys.

2013
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:19,020
I'll do it to her.
Still drop my entire night.

2014
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,650
Two thousand 19 toy.
Hold on,

2015
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,251
hold on.
Hold on.

2016
01:34:21,251 --> 01:34:22,084
Hold on.
Why don't we do for kids to get through 

2017
01:34:25,091 --> 01:34:25,924
grant.
Just start.

2018
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,800
Giant.
Show a big.

2019
01:34:29,801 --> 01:34:31,100
I don't want to hear this.
Pull back.

2020
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:31,690
No,
no.

2021
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:34,870
Listen what I'm saying.
One giant show everywhere.

2022
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:39,730
Madison Square Garden.
Forty five different cities.

2023
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,250
Something show.
Listen,

2024
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,260
we could do that tomorrow.
Here's the deal.

2025
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,350
If each one of us did a half an hour,
we've got a two hour show.

2026
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:49,570
I can do it half an hour right now.
Yeah,

2027
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:53,080
me too.
Oh fucking love to do half an hour.

2028
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:55,210
That's all I got.
I got 35 minutes,

2029
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,570
maybe 34,
35

2030
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,503
morning more.
We'd have it pass it are the worst 

2031
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:04,880
fucking friend.
I am the best friend.

2032
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:06,840
I love you.
Do not love.

2033
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:10,520
Love you.
Love who loves who more mirror you.

2034
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,271
I love you.
Wow.

2035
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:16,271
That's some bad shit.
Are you fucking kidding me?

2036
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:17,930
You really didn't.
You love me more.

2037
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:21,830
Who Do you think loves who more?
I don't.

2038
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:24,180
I've never thought about that with you 
already.

2039
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:25,643
I haven't seen it already more than it 
loves to know that I never thought 

2040
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,130
disorders of mood more than a low 
volume,

2041
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:36,860
but now they love him more than he loves
me.

2042
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:39,170
Now.
What do you think?

2043
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:44,420
You guys are both.
Faggots not going to be tied into this.

2044
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:46,370
That's rude.
I feel like I don't.

2045
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:49,560
I don't have a meter.
I don't have a love meter.

2046
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:52,320
Burt,
love your job.

2047
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:58,290
I would stop almost dying.
So.

2048
01:35:58,291 --> 01:35:59,150
Oh,
so tired.

2049
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,760
Like run to the top of the hill or dope 
or whatever.

2050
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:06,050
Joe Goes.
You realize that?

2051
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:09,560
Oh yeah dude.
I'm conor Mcgregor.

2052
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,660
I don't think you understand.
Okay.

2053
01:36:11,661 --> 01:36:12,980
So.
So Tom went,

2054
01:36:12,990 --> 01:36:14,210
when we got this thing,
I was like,

2055
01:36:14,211 --> 01:36:15,280
I want to do this.
And Tom was like,

2056
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,710
I'll register.
You can register.

2057
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:18,320
Like I'll register.
Here's a number.

2058
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:19,520
Get registered.
Yeah.

2059
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:20,693
Um,
and then you didn't say anything with 

2060
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:22,784
burt.
I think.

2061
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:26,240
Anyway,
I got an email about the 10th or twelfth

2062
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:30,710
of October from some lady at snap 
fitness in Shawnee,

2063
01:36:30,711 --> 01:36:32,480
Kansas.
Hey Kelsey,

2064
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:34,610
you know,
you're accidentally registered in my gym

2065
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,220
and we are doing an oct challenge.
Yeah.

2066
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:39,590
Um,
so I think I should take your off.

2067
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:43,520
Currently you're in third place and then
what did you say?

2068
01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:47,870
I was really sees me first place at the 
time.

2069
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:49,940
I was like,
I can take you out,

2070
01:36:49,941 --> 01:36:50,774
but I'm in a pot.
I'm going to podcast challenge with my 

2071
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:53,234
friends.
Rogan said Thompson Gaura and Bert 

2072
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:55,941
Kreischer and go,
oh,

2073
01:36:55,941 --> 01:36:56,774
Bert Kreischer.
He's in sixth place in our legit Jim of 

2074
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:02,270
people trying to work out for a second.
You were like,

2075
01:37:02,271 --> 01:37:03,061
oh,
Bert Kreischer.

2076
01:37:03,061 --> 01:37:03,894
It's

2077
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:13,660
love him.
She just knows you is big be Christ.

2078
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:32,650
That's my God.
Oh my God.

2079
01:37:56,390 --> 01:38:01,390
No.
I know words be on the leader board,

2080
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:09,120
but I have to be honest,
as humble as I try to be.

2081
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:10,381
If she said,
oh,

2082
01:38:10,381 --> 01:38:13,050
Joe Rogan Joe Rogan,
I'd be like,

2083
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:14,100
oh,
she likes me.

2084
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:15,603
I probably.
The way I recognize that because that's 

2085
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:21,591
exactly how I see this fucking name on 
my board.

2086
01:38:24,961 --> 01:38:25,621
I'd be like,
Oh yeah,

2087
01:38:25,621 --> 01:38:26,340
yeah,
yeah.

2088
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:27,390
Anyway,
so I was like,

2089
01:38:27,391 --> 01:38:28,230
yeah,
you can take me off.

2090
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:30,540
Just make sure my points,
I'll start over and she goes,

2091
01:38:30,541 --> 01:38:31,590
you know what,
actually,

2092
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:34,140
that's cool.
I'm going to keep you guys on there.

2093
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:35,063
Do you understand that?
We got better as a score in terms of 

2094
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:42,621
like how well we did in comparison to 
most people with zero point one percent,

2095
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:44,543
which is much higher because it makes 
sense much higher than Elizabeth Warren 

2096
01:38:48,511 --> 01:38:53,511
is claiming that she is.
That's what I'm saying.

2097
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,280
Do you?
Not Crazy.

2098
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,380
We did.
What we did was bizarre.

2099
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:10,730
I shout out to impact fitness out here.
That's what you're registered with.

2100
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:13,040
Did you ever go to the gym?
Work out there.

2101
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,920
It is.
Keep going.

2102
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:17,783
So Micah,
Brian and Sean worked out with them a 

2103
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:21,480
month.
Wow.

2104
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,000
Did they do get personal trainers?
Yeah,

2105
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:25,140
those were the guys.
Oh,

2106
01:39:25,141 --> 01:39:27,770
I met a dude yesterday,
Yogis?

2107
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:29,610
He was like,
let me fly you,

2108
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:33,990
put you on his legs like a baby holds 
you up,

2109
01:39:33,991 --> 01:39:35,490
stretched you and shit.
He was like,

2110
01:39:35,491 --> 01:39:37,140
Hey,
do you know Bert Kreischer?

2111
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:39,360
I would love to do that with him.
And I was like,

2112
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:41,850
do you normally do with like two people 
on one guy?

2113
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:46,140
And he said,
what do you mean get him up?

2114
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:47,880
He goes,
I for sure could not get them up.

2115
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:53,520
That guy was anticipating a human 
centipede on a trampoline.

2116
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:58,590
Oh my God.
What's that one?

2117
01:39:58,591 --> 01:39:59,810
That swings.
Yeah.

2118
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:00,620
Trophies.
Right?

2119
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:03,440
When Santa Pete was the three of you.
I love that.

2120
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:07,290
We all went to the.
Who Do you think?

2121
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:14,650
Do you think we're not doing this all 
the answer,

2122
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:16,023
Tom.
Answer.

2123
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:17,283
Rel.
Answer.

2124
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:18,593
Not Answer.
Do you think you'd love not joining 

2125
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:25,930
this?
I'm missing all my friends.

2126
01:40:31,051 --> 01:40:32,250
My friends like me.
You guys,

2127
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:34,650
you're crazy.
We focusing on the wrong things.

2128
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:41,880
I spend more time with red.
So if one of you try to attack,

2129
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:43,830
are you?
I have a problem with that.

2130
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:45,500
All right,
go ahead.

2131
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,120
I,
I've been friends for too long,

2132
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:50,820
but like that doesn't make sense.
It doesn't compute.

2133
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:53,500
This is my friend.
We got to work this out.

2134
01:40:53,501 --> 01:40:54,334
We gotta figure out.
I don't know you as well as I know him 

2135
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:58,720
for a million hours to know you for 
$400,000.

2136
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:03,160
We did really well.
So what the fuck went wrong?

2137
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:05,500
This.
That's just how we're all.

2138
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:09,580
We all have to kind of be so I don't 
love anybody anymore.

2139
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,100
One of you,
if one of you,

2140
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:14,860
if we're on an island,
if we're on an island,

2141
01:41:14,861 --> 01:41:17,450
you got to eat somewhere.
Oh,

2142
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:18,670
you know the answer,
Bro.

2143
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:21,663
Let me tell you something.
I'm starving to death for eight in a 

2144
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:24,440
year.
Yes.

2145
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:29,570
One hundred percent kosher eating 
cereal.

2146
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:33,880
One body.
Tell me to eat me.

2147
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:35,350
I don't want to stay alive,
man.

2148
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:41,650
One hundred percent problem.
Pull you aside and be like,

2149
01:41:41,651 --> 01:41:42,720
who you want to kill,
bro?

2150
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:49,280
Get the eyeballs.
Rogan's ass.

2151
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:54,313
Problem is you don't want to die knowing
you ate your friend and it didn't 

2152
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:02,710
matter.
I don't want to die.

2153
01:42:02,711 --> 01:42:03,110
No,
you.

2154
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:05,170
Here's the reality.
Here's the reality.

2155
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:08,140
If you hadn't said this in this scenario
is real.

2156
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:09,173
There's three of us would be so paranoid
about you killing us that we would 

2157
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:14,043
definitely kill you.
It will be like everything's cool and 

2158
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:19,880
you and then we would take rocks and 
just.

2159
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:20,781
No,
no,

2160
01:42:20,781 --> 01:42:23,860
no.
How do we kill that won't be touched,

2161
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:25,170
but over here for the last seconds.

2162
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:29,343
So tonight we got to throw.
I'll get the big rock and you get the 

2163
01:42:36,881 --> 01:42:38,430
other rap.
Seriously,

2164
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:39,363
we have competed against them.
How do you think we would go about 

2165
01:42:41,171 --> 01:42:42,004
killing?
We would have to make them think that 

2166
01:42:42,671 --> 01:42:44,920
we're definitely not thinking about that
and they'll be like,

2167
01:42:44,921 --> 01:42:47,110
hey guys,
we're still thinking about it,

2168
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:49,270
but we would try to be slick about.
No,

2169
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:49,620
no,
no,

2170
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,051
no,
no,

2171
01:42:50,051 --> 01:42:52,600
no.
We'd sit by a fire and then I would go,

2172
01:42:52,601 --> 01:42:54,520
hey joe,
when you eat marijuana,

2173
01:42:54,521 --> 01:42:55,354
does that break down differently or 
deliver the number 11 hydroxy real 

2174
01:43:01,911 --> 01:43:03,240
quick.
No,

2175
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:05,950
you got to thick that.
He would be thinking the same thing too,

2176
01:43:05,951 --> 01:43:07,090
so he's like,
oh fuck.

2177
01:43:07,091 --> 01:43:08,290
I would never turn it against these 
guys,

2178
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:09,670
but for sure we're not thinking about 
it.

2179
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:10,803
They think if I could turn against him,
I would have to kill the king of Judah 

2180
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:15,440
immediately.

2181
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,520
Got To accept the fact you're going to 
starve to death.

2182
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:19,653
That's what you gotta do.
You got to accept it because if there's 

2183
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:22,323
only four in the woods and we're stuck 
on the top of a mountain and no one's 

2184
01:43:26,531 --> 01:43:27,364
gotten to us yet,
what are the odds they're going to get 

2185
01:43:28,571 --> 01:43:29,350
to us?
What?

2186
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:30,490
How much time?
We have left,

2187
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:33,310
like 30 hours.
If everything goes great,

2188
01:43:33,311 --> 01:43:35,410
truth is are you would wither away 
first.

2189
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,580
No.
Here's the real truth.

2190
01:43:36,581 --> 01:43:38,800
I've just been thinking about it.
He tried to say immediately,

2191
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:40,630
guys,
I see what's on both of your minds.

2192
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:42,010
You're all thinking of killing each 
other.

2193
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,050
I get it from both points of view.
If we do this,

2194
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,360
we're never going to survive.
I propose a truce.

2195
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:48,370
Joe,
go hot food.

2196
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:51,650
Start to fire the cook.
Obviously Tom,

2197
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:53,553
I don't know man,
cause football is just trying to take 

2198
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:56,670
you know a lot about that.

2199
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:03,623
It was just us,
just us living in the woods world went 

2200
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:11,690
to shit and we're like on an episode of 
life below zero.

2201
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,230
We live in some sort of fucking house 
and we have to put together ourselves.

2202
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:18,110
We'll make it just like we got through 
this weird month.

2203
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:19,243
Okay.
This is fucking strange about being a 

2204
01:44:21,501 --> 01:44:24,860
person is that you don't know what your 
boundaries are,

2205
01:44:24,861 --> 01:44:27,110
you just know what you do most of the 
time,

2206
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:32,030
so all of a sudden when something comes 
up that requires way more of what you're

2207
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:36,030
used to putting in a more way more.
Jude,

2208
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:38,270
but isn't that fucking with your 
perspective at all?

2209
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:47,510
Being a fucking tournament already.
We are middle aged comedians of course.

2210
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:55,310
So you go like,
I'm not doing enough.

2211
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:58,190
I think you already go.
I'm not doing enough already.

2212
01:44:58,220 --> 01:44:59,053
Okay,
so then when you have that thought and 

2213
01:44:59,931 --> 01:45:04,931
you do a month like that and you go,
I'm really not doing it real.

2214
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:08,540
Yeah.
What I try to do is eat healthy.

2215
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:09,374
I fuck hard,
and then it's also a combination of all 

2216
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:18,320
those.
Fuck white chewing gum.

2217
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:24,330
I thought,
that's fucking impressive.

2218
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:35,170
Bazooka bubble pop.
No bubblicious even better than Bazooka.

2219
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:43,590
Much stronger with the shoe store or 
something.

2220
01:45:47,171 --> 01:45:48,004
You're like,
yeah,

2221
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:48,973
y'all went up to the rest of the week.
Five Gallon Tub of it for my daughter's 

2222
01:45:51,201 --> 01:45:52,470
softball team.
Fuck,

2223
01:45:52,490 --> 01:45:54,140
five gallons.
Good.

2224
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:55,170
Damn,
dude.

2225
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:56,413
Welcome to fucking drugs.
That's what I picture red biggly Chu 

2226
01:45:59,901 --> 01:46:04,460
laying pipe bag bag.
I can't make.

2227
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:07,130
I can't make it to where the fucking the
strap.

2228
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:11,710
While I was going to ask you if you 
were,

2229
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:14,390
you said something about my cock fast 
and hard.

2230
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:19,630
That was the name of one of your posts.
Hold on the last day.

2231
01:46:20,001 --> 01:46:21,800
I put it on right at the end though,
but I was like,

2232
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:23,750
you know what,
your heartbeat goes down fast.

2233
01:46:23,751 --> 01:46:24,370
Yeah,
yeah.

2234
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:25,203
By the time of one,
kind of like one 70 12 points for sure 

2235
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,353
if you checked off in Phoenix for 
jerking off to all points were jerking 

2236
01:46:32,931 --> 01:46:34,040
off.
I got done the workout.

2237
01:46:34,041 --> 01:46:36,140
Went up to the room.
Heart rate's still on,

2238
01:46:36,141 --> 01:46:37,540
still in the blue.
You know what,

2239
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:40,370
you shouldn't hide it again.
I sat down,

2240
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:43,100
it got up to the green,
never gotten to the yellow.

2241
01:46:43,101 --> 01:46:44,180
But uh,
I had to,

2242
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:47,840
when I was doing it,
it wasn't moving out of the gray.

2243
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:49,710
His sit down,
you're watching.

2244
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:49,980
I had to

2245
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:50,950
watch it.
Uh,

2246
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:51,863
interesting.
I had turned off the Bluetooth because 

2247
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:54,324
it was based on my headset,
so I just worked off and it cut off the 

2248
01:46:56,701 --> 01:46:59,040
monitor and so I thought it was a dead.
Yeah,

2249
01:46:59,090 --> 01:47:00,860
it cut off the Monitor.
If Your Bluetooth was on,

2250
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:02,400
it didn't register points.
Right,

2251
01:47:02,401 --> 01:47:02,741
right,
right,

2252
01:47:02,741 --> 01:47:03,280
right,
right.

2253
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,850
So you can't have headset but you can't 
have had sets.

2254
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:07,311
No,
no,

2255
01:47:07,311 --> 01:47:07,591
no,
no,

2256
01:47:07,591 --> 01:47:09,020
no.
I cut off the heads.

2257
01:47:09,021 --> 01:47:10,500
That's how I got here.
The porn on my phone,

2258
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:13,200
so I cut off the Bluetooth so I can 
watch a porn.

2259
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:14,041
Oh.
And by the way,

2260
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:14,874
I had to sit down like a catcher.
I had to squat the Jack off to try to 

2261
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:20,870
burn,
to get some movement going.

2262
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:21,723
So I was like,
I was like,

2263
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:22,231
I was like,
yeah,

2264
01:47:22,231 --> 01:47:23,064
so I'm squatting,
I'm pumping up a little bit pumping and 

2265
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,160
yeah,
12 points,

2266
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:30,150
12 points,
but I was afraid of him register

2267
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:31,880
terminal.
That's a fun points.

2268
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:33,380
Points.
Hey,

2269
01:47:33,381 --> 01:47:34,214
that's three minutes,
four minutes because you're in the 

2270
01:47:36,571 --> 01:47:38,970
green.
I don't think I wasn't added wrong.

2271
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:41,760
You know,
in a lot of those Kung Fu classes,

2272
01:47:41,761 --> 01:47:42,594
they make you do a horse dance and they 
make you hold it a little while to a 

2273
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,093
horse dance stand like this and just 
hold it really make you stand for like 

2274
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:51,930
40 minutes,
40,

2275
01:47:51,931 --> 01:47:52,800
40 minutes.
No,

2276
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,180
no,
no bullshit.

2277
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:55,393
Yeah,
there's a lot of really wacky ideas 

2278
01:47:57,050 --> 01:48:01,380
regards to Kung Fu type training and 
some people would just make up their own

2279
01:48:01,381 --> 01:48:04,920
protocols,
like standard horseshoe course stance,

2280
01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:05,903
stand there for one hour to put your 
hand over the flame for as long as you 

2281
01:48:09,151 --> 01:48:10,440
can.
It's also like,

2282
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:13,920
it's also the same thing that happened 
to us this month.

2283
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,560
Like how much can you do?
It's crazy.

2284
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:18,720
It was completely.
It didn't make any sense.

2285
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:23,400
Psycho you fucked it up.

2286
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:24,840
No,
no,

2287
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:26,530
no.
School.

2288
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:28,800
Go to the bathroom,
go to the bathroom.

2289
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:30,760
He's got to pee in a bottle.
No,

2290
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:31,613
no,
no.

2291
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:32,813
I'm going to go to the bathroom while 
he's doing this because I don't want to 

2292
01:48:38,131 --> 01:48:39,030
go again.
Come on,

2293
01:48:39,031 --> 01:48:43,680
let's go.
Come on over.

2294
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:47,880
Let me think about it.
Don't even think about it.

2295
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:51,563
Think about it.
Did

2296
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:56,350
you get to you joe,
are you.

2297
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,990
There was a great month.
I couldn't believe I did.

2298
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:01,890
I didn't that it was a lot of fun.
I,

2299
01:49:01,970 --> 01:49:03,400
I couldn't believe he did,
but I,

2300
01:49:03,401 --> 01:49:04,234
I,
I,

2301
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:09,790
I wasn't completely surprised.
Really?

2302
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:11,410
Yeah.
I was happy.

2303
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:15,640
I was happy.
I was happy that you showed me.

2304
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:20,460
I always like we've been friends for a 
long time and I've always said like,

2305
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:23,590
he's just got this like very strong 
mind.

2306
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,210
Like you're not,
you know,

2307
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,233
you're not a guy who gives up on shit 
and you're a guy who thinks through 

2308
01:49:30,161 --> 01:49:33,700
things.
We've had many comments about that.

2309
01:49:33,730 --> 01:49:37,010
So those last few days I was like,
I think if I can get like rafting,

2310
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:37,863
they go to sleep a bunch of points and 
then right after they wake right before 

2311
01:49:40,301 --> 01:49:41,134
they wake up another bunch of points,
which was like into my beginning of my 

2312
01:49:43,651 --> 01:49:46,150
life into my night,
I could break them mentally,

2313
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,210
get like 700

2314
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,600
above them.
Yeah.

2315
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:51,070
Then you rubbed me right then like,
hey man,

2316
01:49:51,071 --> 01:49:52,430
you're pretty smart.
My key,

2317
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:55,390
I think I just got them like the 29th of
October.

2318
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:56,770
Yeah.
You got deep,

2319
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:59,110
you got pretty deep,
you got in,

2320
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:00,970
you went.
I mean,

2321
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:05,971
there was one day that you ran 15 miles 
and I posted that on my instagram.

2322
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:07,713
I was like,
do you understand that already didn't 

2323
01:50:08,261 --> 01:50:09,094
work out for 10 years.
He ran 15 miles and then he wrote two 

2324
01:50:13,241 --> 01:50:14,830
kilometers.
Yeah,

2325
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,873
yeah,

2326
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,610
five meters on the 500,
500 meters,

2327
01:50:18,611 --> 01:50:22,390
five kilometers with rowing and then 
biked for like 15 miles is ridiculous.

2328
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:27,160
I put that shit on instagram after that,
I was only out of spite because the only

2329
01:50:27,161 --> 01:50:29,170
thing that can drive me,
it's just pure spite.

2330
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,090
And what was the spike?
What was the motivation?

2331
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:32,860
Hated all of you for dragging me into 
it.

2332
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:38,100
I already decided I didn't drag me into 
this.

2333
01:50:38,711 --> 01:50:42,310
I had no intention of doing it.
My life was fine.

2334
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:43,810
My life is fine too,
man.

2335
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,650
My life's good.
And everybody's like,

2336
01:50:45,651 --> 01:50:47,400
first of all,
every one of these challenges.

2337
01:50:47,401 --> 01:50:52,401
It's just been a shit Joe Rogan to all 
redoing the contest.

2338
01:50:52,941 --> 01:50:56,300
Bring this one out.
That's my surfing.

2339
01:50:58,330 --> 01:50:59,163
Surfing.
Surfing is going to be amazing for this 

2340
01:51:00,541 --> 01:51:01,390
shit,
dude.

2341
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:03,880
We're going to the pipeline in the 
lineup.

2342
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:05,620
This is it.
This is us.

2343
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:11,480
There's already an the tracker and 
everything for the fuck shot thing guys.

2344
01:51:16,091 --> 01:51:18,000
I live in New York.
Locked Ari.

2345
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:20,590
Ari?
Ari is locked.

2346
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,050
I think I might have logged it.
I didn't know that.

2347
01:51:24,051 --> 01:51:29,051
That thing locked every door right 
before he goes through it for boogeyman.

2348
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:32,630
I thought it just wasn't coming in there
and you were smiling.

2349
01:51:32,631 --> 01:51:33,464
I wasn't coming in.
I had no idea that I thought you were 

2350
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:37,540
not coming in.
I didn't know why.

2351
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:38,393
I was like,
I don't get it.

2352
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,000
I was like,
how is that?

2353
01:51:40,001 --> 01:51:40,834
Not a bit.

2354
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:46,180
I thought that was definitely a bit out,
but I didn't shut it.

2355
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:48,880
I was saying births like every door he 
goes through lucky,

2356
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:51,940
lucky man comes through,
but it's not what I sound like.

2357
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:54,123
What does that feel like to have.
Actually that actually means is you're 

2358
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:56,943
very distinct of everybody.
Everybody can do an impression 

2359
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:01,410
basically.
I don't know if that's the state.

2360
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,470
The first person I've ever heard do it 
was red band.

2361
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:08,140
It really caught me off guard when he 
was like me,

2362
01:52:08,141 --> 01:52:08,431
me,
me.

2363
01:52:08,431 --> 01:52:08,740
Me,
me,

2364
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:09,640
me,
me,

2365
01:52:11,310 --> 01:52:12,143
I got to do an impression of you.
We can definitely do an impression of 

2366
01:52:15,341 --> 01:52:20,270
red shirt.
Say Last Colt,

2367
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:21,461
Colt,
Colt,

2368
01:52:21,461 --> 01:52:22,300
Cabana,
wrestler.

2369
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:23,960
Oh,
okay.

2370
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:24,843
Really?
I thought it was some Jewish thing sort 

2371
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:29,170
of starved.
David Cole.

2372
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:33,160
Shoot Scott the first podcasters.
Colt Cabana.

2373
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:34,021
Really?
Yeah.

2374
01:52:34,021 --> 01:52:34,520
Yeah,
yeah.

2375
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:35,353
Well who was the first ever?
Was Ricky Gervais' first counter into 

2376
01:52:40,391 --> 01:52:42,280
the mainstream,
but what about um,

2377
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:43,990
uh,
the guy from Adam Curry,

2378
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:45,860
the God pod father.

2379
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,270
Was He the first?
Yeah,

2380
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:47,720
but,
but,

2381
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,553
but what does the girl was doing it for 
awhile before we should probably 

2382
01:52:53,211 --> 01:52:54,890
establish who is first,
right?

2383
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:56,810
Like George Washington,
who was the first president.

2384
01:52:57,290 --> 01:52:58,123
We're all professional comedians.
Most professional politicians would be 

2385
01:53:01,911 --> 01:53:04,210
able to tell you who the first fucking 
president one idea.

2386
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:07,590
We're like,
who's the first podcast here?

2387
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:08,690
We really don't know.
Right?

2388
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:10,510
Dude?
I heard radio,

2389
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,660
radio,
and then it just became who?

2390
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,410
Lewis first?
Between you and Marin?

2391
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:15,780
Ma'Am,
for sure.

2392
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:16,211
For sure.
Yeah.

2393
01:53:16,211 --> 01:53:17,044
I don't know.
I don't know.

2394
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:17,893
I'm asking to stop.
Here's what I think that Adam hurry was 

2395
01:53:24,801 --> 01:53:25,634
number one who's hurting.
Curry is vj from MTV and he is known as 

2396
01:53:29,931 --> 01:53:32,000
the pod father,
but the guy that started podcasting,

2397
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:36,770
the marriage model,
I don't know her,

2398
01:53:36,771 --> 01:53:39,200
his relationship history,
but I think he's the,

2399
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,660
he's,
he's George Washington.

2400
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:42,860
Who is Adam?

2401
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:46,730
Adam Curry.
How early was he was up.

2402
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:50,180
He faces number one then the first big 
one where you were,

2403
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:53,510
but no first one yet.
Uh,

2404
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:54,770
I,
yes,

2405
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:55,693
I would argue that.
Or is that Adam curry definitely is the 

2406
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,660
procedure basis according to Wikipedia,
which were basically always right.

2407
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:07,870
Always right.
Which by the way list or a thing it says

2408
01:54:09,501 --> 01:54:13,340
53 fake news launching.
Keep up with these trolls.

2409
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:15,040
Two thousand six.
But,

2410
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:16,550
uh,
in June 2005,

2411
01:54:16,551 --> 01:54:20,090
apple added podcasting to the itunes.
So it was already going.

2412
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:20,510
No,
no,

2413
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:22,300
no.
Ricky Gervais' had a red,

2414
01:54:22,301 --> 01:54:24,470
a BBC show.
No,

2415
01:54:24,471 --> 01:54:24,830
no,
no.

2416
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:29,330
His show was launched a year after Adam 
Curry's,

2417
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:33,500
after podcasting was added to itunes 
where it was.

2418
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:36,050
I was already going as a few talking 
about.

2419
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:37,533
Yeah,
right.

2420
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:39,590
No,
but Ari's point is valid.

2421
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:42,170
It was already there,
but it's not.

2422
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:45,630
You're talking about different people,
right.

2423
01:54:45,650 --> 01:54:46,483
Started in 2004,
who's was two years before company 

2424
01:54:48,831 --> 01:54:49,664
Libsyn,
which,

2425
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:54,020
but wait,
you're saying apple was started and then

2426
01:54:54,021 --> 01:54:59,021
a year later podcast,
let's just google this for a goof.

2427
01:54:59,390 --> 01:55:02,800
Who was the very first podcast started?
That's how.

2428
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:04,670
That's what I.
and that's where you failed at located.

2429
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,110
Wait,
let me just chime in,

2430
01:55:06,990 --> 01:55:10,740
but the ones that come up with 
information,

2431
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:11,593
we don't have to get to start asking 
more questions as I was looking through 

2432
01:55:13,491 --> 01:55:14,850
this.
Excellent excuse making.

2433
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:17,750
You're making A.
I prefer you get back to the doing,

2434
01:55:17,751 --> 01:55:22,140
which you used to do it for you.
Jamie,

2435
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:23,013
back to celebrity.
Under correct thread to start off and 

2436
01:55:26,431 --> 01:55:28,850
said it was Internet radio because I was
going to say I.

2437
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:32,960
I was recording Internet radio talk 
shows and you were a lot.

2438
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:33,921
No,
no,

2439
01:55:33,921 --> 01:55:35,210
no.
Let me jump in right now.

2440
01:55:35,211 --> 01:55:36,044
So there's a different suite because 
myspace was offering an app on a phone 

2441
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:39,403
where you could do a podcast.
That's where the money stop for a 

2442
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:49,220
moment.
Jamie,

2443
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:50,820
if you.
If you had a guest,

2444
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,600
who do you think was number one,
but by me?

2445
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:58,880
What did you think of it?
Like Adam curry gets the credit for.

2446
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:00,480
I believe it.
That's what I mean.

2447
01:56:00,481 --> 01:56:03,890
That's what the international podcast,
the very.

2448
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:07,190
I think he invented the name podcast.
Oh,

2449
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:09,330
my pointed to him and that wikipedia 
article,

2450
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:12,250
he invented the name,
I think Jamie.

2451
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:15,750
Jamie,
something real quick.

2452
01:56:15,751 --> 01:56:18,540
He does the podcast with.
There was another guy was like a science

2453
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:22,230
tech guy.
Some guy named Bob Doyle,

2454
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:23,450
or sorry,
I had it.

2455
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:24,973
He was a bomb,
but it should be noted that Bobby Kelly 

2456
01:56:27,901 --> 01:56:30,630
definitely had podcasts way before this.
Oh yeah.

2457
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:33,390
Yeah.
That's the worst gets tricky is podcasts

2458
01:56:33,391 --> 01:56:37,750
were released on my space through an of 
phone who's called podcast.

2459
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:41,240
A memory.
I've had a podcasting.

2460
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:46,600
Yes,
Jamie.

2461
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:48,420
Jamie,
Jamie.

2462
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:50,850
You've been here for,
I don't know how many podcasts.

2463
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,760
Everybody loves you.
What is.

2464
01:56:53,910 --> 01:56:55,380
Do you have a favorite podcast?
Seriously,

2465
01:56:55,381 --> 01:56:57,990
because you've witnessed so many people 
that I've.

2466
01:56:58,050 --> 01:57:01,860
That I've sat through and you've sat 
through that to be number one in the top

2467
01:57:01,861 --> 01:57:06,290
three that comes to mind over here.
It looks like the one we did last year,

2468
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:09,060
this was pretty good.
That's probably for sure up there.

2469
01:57:09,130 --> 01:57:10,020
It's one of the best.

2470
01:57:10,670 --> 01:57:13,620
First of all,
Yoga when we coming down.

2471
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:15,990
Getting Chuck.
Come on.

2472
01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:16,943
Yeah,
that was fun.

2473
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:18,260
What else?
One of those.

2474
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:19,173
One of the first fight companions 
because that started a whole series of 

2475
01:57:21,151 --> 01:57:22,980
things,
so that's memorable to you for sure.

2476
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:23,873
Anything else?
An individual at podcast now if they've 

2477
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:26,693
all kind of know.
How about a guest that really like you 

2478
01:57:28,081 --> 01:57:29,070
go like,
Holy Shit,

2479
01:57:29,071 --> 01:57:31,530
like kid cuddy and Maynard was probably 
my top two for like,

2480
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,230
wow,
that's maynard's.

2481
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:38,060
Maynard James Keenan had asked.
I'm sorry.

2482
01:57:38,490 --> 01:57:39,870
I'm sorry.
Listen,

2483
01:57:39,871 --> 01:57:40,704
you got it.
With these one of these have done is 

2484
01:57:43,081 --> 01:57:44,220
enhanced our friendship.

2485
01:57:47,370 --> 01:57:49,800
Some work and get closer to your 
friends.

2486
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:52,980
Jamie's got fucking close to each other 
this month.

2487
01:57:53,650 --> 01:57:58,500
Let's talk about this.
Especially with Youtube.

2488
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:01,350
I really like you too.
I feel like I really click with you.

2489
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,920
Fucking you fucking asshole.
During what time?

2490
01:58:11,011 --> 01:58:11,551
It was like,
Hey,

2491
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:12,384
I think I'm injured.
We could bring the separator play this 

2492
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:21,810
fall.
You're putting in Nashville,

2493
01:58:21,811 --> 01:58:22,644
Tennessee,
right here in the place where we've got 

2494
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:26,490
inducted into the hall of fame.
Great Room right here in the country.

2495
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:30,780
We're on the world tour today.
The stadium tour.

2496
01:58:31,110 --> 01:58:31,943
There's going to be fun.
I wanted to call it the big stadium 

2497
01:58:33,721 --> 01:58:34,554
tour.
It's just stating to her above is all 

2498
01:58:35,791 --> 01:58:36,624
the information on it,
but when we talk about today is we're 

2499
01:58:38,071 --> 01:58:42,190
going to introduce five cities before 
Christmas to on sale because

2500
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:45,640
on insights rug you guys asked for a 
longer planning dates so you can plan to

2501
01:58:45,641 --> 01:58:46,500
be.
Shows me,

2502
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:47,383
generally it comes to cities.
St Louis where we're kicking it off of 

2503
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:53,710
man was weird.
Phoenix,

2504
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:55,810
Glendale,
Arizona.

2505
01:58:56,440 --> 01:59:00,640
Cardinals play a stadium as well,
so those are the first two.

2506
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:02,980
The other three will be announced here 
shortly and again,

2507
01:59:02,981 --> 01:59:06,370
they'll all be on sale before Christmas.
And remember,

2508
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:10,210
this is all about game day.
Show his guard thing day or garth day,

2509
01:59:10,211 --> 01:59:13,480
however you want to look at it,
your full color support your team.

2510
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:17,110
Let's go have some fun and let's get 
physical plan music and I like that.

2511
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:24,460
So weird.
Here's the thing.

2512
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:26,240
Three.
Jamie,

2513
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:32,650
why you just take it by the way we got 
to say this.

2514
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,800
Garth is an amazing performer.
He's so many people's favorite.

2515
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:43,990
He's the top selling act.
He sells more tickets than beyond.

2516
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:44,883
Say that dude is other level.
They sold that Notre Dame stadium in 

2517
01:59:49,641 --> 01:59:53,410
like under a fucking hour.
Like just unbelievable.

2518
01:59:53,411 --> 01:59:54,244
Like it's out of control.
He's been so famous for so long that I 

2519
01:59:58,871 --> 02:00:02,110
think he really thinks like what are,
what are normal people like,

2520
02:00:02,370 --> 02:00:06,040
you know,
like how much does a bottle of whiskey.

2521
02:00:06,041 --> 02:00:06,880
He'd be like,
I don't know,

2522
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:07,773
10 grand fucking have any idea,
and his social media is really awkward 

2523
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:15,700
and it's the best thing in the world 
right now.

2524
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:16,590
It really,
really.

2525
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:18,990
It really is the announcement that 
social,

2526
02:00:18,991 --> 02:00:20,750
that facebook one that you know,
was it,

2527
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:22,210
you saw that one?
He's like,

2528
02:00:22,211 --> 02:00:26,200
well I guess it's official.
Christina just posted this video.

2529
02:00:26,201 --> 02:00:29,680
I'm obsessed with the garth brooks and 
it's so fucking amazing.

2530
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:30,514
It's amazing.
It's one of the best videos I've ever 

2531
02:00:31,721 --> 02:00:34,660
seen that I watched over and over and 
over again.

2532
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:35,543
So you see your wife posted earlier with
the lady getting hit in the head with 

2533
02:00:38,591 --> 02:00:39,910
the fish.
Oh my God.

2534
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:43,960
This is one push post.
Hashtag.

2535
02:00:46,130 --> 02:00:48,640
Hashtag ask.
Garth asked me anything.

2536
02:00:48,641 --> 02:00:50,050
Okay.
Hashtag happy.

2537
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:52,300
Hashtag.
Hashtag Mr.

2538
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:56,530
Year,
what year it stopped this.

2539
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:01,380
Jamie,
what does that stop this?

2540
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:06,420
He does that thing where he does this.
He also knows he's so famous and his,

2541
02:01:08,090 --> 02:01:09,880
his wife's famous but she's not asking 
why.

2542
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,370
Wait what?
Yes.

2543
02:01:12,950 --> 02:01:14,970
Yeah,
Mr.

2544
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:17,590
that's why he goes to Matt.
Mr Yearwood.

2545
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:19,910
So he does that thing where he's like,
I'm Mr.

2546
02:01:20,430 --> 02:01:21,161
Year,
what I took.

2547
02:01:21,161 --> 02:01:22,810
My wife slept for the,
you know,

2548
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:24,700
just to.
Because I'm just like y'all,

2549
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:30,340
my wife's first name to married Trisha 
Yearwood.

2550
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:32,700
Yeah,
they've married for awhile.

2551
02:01:34,770 --> 02:01:35,600
Okay,
go ahead.

2552
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:37,510
That's great winters.
He's just,

2553
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:40,130
he's just.
I think he's very sincere.

2554
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,113
I believe it,
but there is something fucking weird 

2555
02:01:43,371 --> 02:01:45,860
going on there and I think he's got a 
couple of bodies in the trunk.

2556
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:48,470
I just don't.
I think there's something going on.

2557
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:50,330
I think it's somebody.

2558
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:51,433
You know how,
how there's something about like when 

2559
02:01:53,241 --> 02:01:54,074
you watch,
when you were or you remember back to 

2560
02:01:55,341 --> 02:01:59,650
Michael Jackson and you're like,
that guy got weird for obviously,

2561
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:04,730
but also how in comprehensible is it to 
be as famous as he is?

2562
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:07,940
Like my was Michael Jackson,
Garth Brooks,

2563
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:09,103
like for me the part that's,
that's a reach or whatever is that none 

2564
02:02:11,751 --> 02:02:13,520
of my friends were ever like.
Amen.

2565
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:14,503
Do you hear that new garth brooks track?
Like I don't have anyone in my life 

2566
02:02:17,091 --> 02:02:19,470
talking about him,
so it seems almost like a,

2567
02:02:19,550 --> 02:02:21,110
like a foreign entity,
right?

2568
02:02:21,111 --> 02:02:24,260
Like I just go to the country fans.
Did you ever lie to save and stuff?

2569
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:29,620
I don't know any of it come from country
to country.

2570
02:02:33,870 --> 02:02:35,780
Sure,
sure.

2571
02:02:35,781 --> 02:02:37,280
Of course.
Yeah,

2572
02:02:37,290 --> 02:02:37,770
it's,
it's,

2573
02:02:37,770 --> 02:02:38,810
it's,
it's everybody I know.

2574
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:44,470
If you look at like all time fun 
drinking songs,

2575
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:45,313
that's one of them.

2576
02:02:45,410 --> 02:02:48,060
Damn.
It's close to number one man.

2577
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:53,420
Tried to relax and not worry about which
fucking rednecks drunk enough to relax.

2578
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:56,260
You have a couple of kilos in.
Yeah,

2579
02:02:58,090 --> 02:02:59,180
I can appreciate it.
Dude.

2580
02:02:59,210 --> 02:03:01,250
I have.
I want some clint black shit.

2581
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:04,610
I have some Hank Williams stuff.
I'm not knocking it all together.

2582
02:03:04,611 --> 02:03:05,444
I'm just saying he's not somebody that I
regularly or that I even talked to 

2583
02:03:08,811 --> 02:03:11,200
someone who's like,
I'm going to Garth Brooks in general.

2584
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:16,100
So waylon jennings and his social media.
Is that special?

2585
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:18,640
It is remarkable.
Amazing.

2586
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:20,570
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

2587
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:23,760
He has a show where like he,
whenever he,

2588
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:24,720
he's so famous,
they,

2589
02:03:24,721 --> 02:03:26,180
he'll just post.
He'll be like,

2590
02:03:26,181 --> 02:03:29,310
we're inside studio g right now.
He calls it studio g?

2591
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:32,450
Yes.
Doing that with your,

2592
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:35,570
your podcast.
I'm already doing.

2593
02:03:35,571 --> 02:03:36,430
I'm already doing.

2594
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:40,940
I'm already.
He does funny,

2595
02:03:40,970 --> 02:03:44,690
like he does weird waves where he 
doesn't know how to end a video,

2596
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:49,490
so he'll just be like a CV at this 
stadium this weekend.

2597
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,720
You'll just wave.
It's hilarious.

2598
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:57,530
It's the best thing I've ever seen.
It is pretty fucking amazing.

2599
02:03:57,590 --> 02:04:00,290
I'm obsessed with it now and I found it 
through him and push.

2600
02:04:00,590 --> 02:04:02,320
Yeah.
It's a,

2601
02:04:02,330 --> 02:04:04,460
and I don't know if he's kind of video 
yet,

2602
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:05,061
but even,
you know,

2603
02:04:05,061 --> 02:04:06,350
Vic Berger,
the editor,

2604
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:08,940
he's so.
He used to,

2605
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:11,510
I don't know how he pulled.
He just pulls the best content,

2606
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:13,510
edits it amazingly,
and he,

2607
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:16,400
he put up a bunch of garth's instagram 
stuff.

2608
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:20,030
It's great.
Or just go to garth brooks story.

2609
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:21,403
Just make your own decisions.
We should do a stadium tour where we 

2610
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:26,120
just get,
get comfortable.

2611
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:30,180
Was that what he says?
What physical?

2612
02:04:32,060 --> 02:04:36,160
Physical for the music physical out 
there while we're making you like what?

2613
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:40,120
Let's get physical or doing comedy.
I like that.

2614
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:41,053
You're like comedy.
Who Do I call comedy physical because 

2615
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,060
here's the thing.
He was like,

2616
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:49,260
we're going to do this in stadiums where
normally use football teams.

2617
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:50,543
So were your favorite football teams 
uniform and then let's get physical 

2618
02:04:54,511 --> 02:04:56,310
while we're making these.
What is weird about it?

2619
02:04:56,311 --> 02:04:57,690
You know,
like my dad would say.

2620
02:04:57,790 --> 02:04:58,680
Yeah,
go ahead.

2621
02:04:59,080 --> 02:04:59,913
Sorry.
There's a weird thing that happened for 

2622
02:05:01,291 --> 02:05:02,124
a little while where if you,
if you were to theatrical comics would 

2623
02:05:07,141 --> 02:05:10,010
get upset at you.
Like if you,

2624
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:12,990
if you moved around too much,
you got physical.

2625
02:05:13,330 --> 02:05:17,190
He acted things out.
People would literally like shun you.

2626
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:20,810
Like there's a few people have thought.
Yeah,

2627
02:05:21,810 --> 02:05:23,310
yeah.
That was a style for a while.

2628
02:05:23,310 --> 02:05:24,143
I remember hearing someone talk,
I want to say it was in the movie 

2629
02:05:26,521 --> 02:05:29,310
comedian Jerry Seinfeld going,
if I have a bit,

2630
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:32,580
I'll act it out because if it gets a 
bigger laugh then that's the purpose.

2631
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:35,660
And I remember feeling vindicated,
so super physical when I started.

2632
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:36,960
Man,
it's a weird thing.

2633
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:37,893
It's weird.
Why would any bell so embraced looking 

2634
02:05:39,551 --> 02:05:44,380
like more shit than I do naturally?
So it'd be like if this shirt has a hole

2635
02:05:44,381 --> 02:05:48,790
in it where to do a set for awhile,
for awhile I was like,

2636
02:05:49,090 --> 02:05:51,190
oh,
you should look for some reason.

2637
02:05:51,191 --> 02:05:52,720
I don't know why I bought into that.
I was like,

2638
02:05:52,721 --> 02:05:57,721
you should just look at your mom's 
house.

2639
02:05:58,001 --> 02:06:02,730
Fans are taken out of a batch.
Oh Shit,

2640
02:06:02,731 --> 02:06:03,564
you're right.

2641
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,160
Wait,
why do you wear what you wear on stage?

2642
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:11,560
I wear things that are curious because 
um,

2643
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:14,770
you but you don't like you,
you dress specifically,

2644
02:06:15,070 --> 02:06:17,380
which as a guy who's wearing no shirt 
and people go,

2645
02:06:17,381 --> 02:06:18,640
oh,
there must be no thought in that.

2646
02:06:18,641 --> 02:06:19,150
I go,
wait,

2647
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:19,990
no,
there's totally thought.

2648
02:06:20,050 --> 02:06:21,110
He had to wear a shirt.
Yeah,

2649
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:26,190
she took me a second to recognize it.
Yeah,

2650
02:06:26,191 --> 02:06:27,050
yeah.
I'm the guy.

2651
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:27,973
I thought that was the whole time.
There's another guy that's doing that 

2652
02:06:31,690 --> 02:06:34,270
though.
How many guys?

2653
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:39,520
Your official influencer?
Chippendale's,

2654
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:44,230
joking.
How about the stars?

2655
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:49,250
Network spots is a chippendale comedy 
network rolling in every week.

2656
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:51,920
Hold on.
You say you don't look it.

2657
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,530
Do you put thought into what you were 
though?

2658
02:06:53,740 --> 02:06:56,380
Yes.
I wear things that are a loose,

2659
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:58,040
loose your,
your hand,

2660
02:06:58,150 --> 02:07:00,880
your wrist or never buttoned.
I want Lucas.

2661
02:07:01,490 --> 02:07:04,040
I want my,
my all the muscles too so to

2662
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:04,873
be covered.
Everything to be like a non form 

2663
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:10,100
fitting.
That's like the opposite of me.

2664
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:10,993
If I wear anything that's form fitting,
I get uncomfortable generally or just 

2665
02:07:14,991 --> 02:07:17,240
for a taping on everyday.
Everyday.

2666
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:18,920
Otherwise five were informed.
Pending.

2667
02:07:18,970 --> 02:07:19,731
Yeah.
People go,

2668
02:07:19,731 --> 02:07:20,564
oh,
somebody needs to fucking your shirts 

2669
02:07:22,641 --> 02:07:24,980
that fit like I can't wear shirts that 
fit.

2670
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:28,220
You can't even find them.
They don't feel like I've tried.

2671
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:31,400
They're like Joe Rogan's trial.
No,

2672
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:32,900
I get that.
I know.

2673
02:07:32,901 --> 02:07:34,730
I understand that.
I'm saying from their,

2674
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:39,460
but I get it because there's also.
Have you ever done like where you go,

2675
02:07:39,550 --> 02:07:40,383
I'm going to get like a bunch of clothes
right now and you put on something that 

2676
02:07:43,151 --> 02:07:43,984
feels cool,
but then you look in the mirror and 

2677
02:07:45,581 --> 02:07:46,900
you're like,
this is too cool,

2678
02:07:50,170 --> 02:07:52,830
too cool for this.
It's way too cold for the stage.

2679
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:54,730
Yeah.
You got to wear something that makes you

2680
02:07:54,731 --> 02:07:58,480
feel cool enough and relaxed.
That's the main thing.

2681
02:07:58,481 --> 02:08:01,690
Comfortable loose.
You can just google wedding or something

2682
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:04,120
where you could just cool among your 
friends.

2683
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:05,680
It's like,
I'm dressing cool,

2684
02:08:05,681 --> 02:08:07,150
but if you're like,
if you put it on,

2685
02:08:07,151 --> 02:08:07,751
you're like,
oh,

2686
02:08:07,751 --> 02:08:11,320
I look like I look like I'm trying to be
Jason Statham right now.

2687
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:14,350
I'm going to be there for jeans,
man.

2688
02:08:14,351 --> 02:08:16,000
You know what I mean?
Like you're like,

2689
02:08:16,001 --> 02:08:17,050
you feel like you're like,

2690
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:20,810
you look in the mirror.
That's who you think you are.

2691
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:31,530
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2692
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:35,670
What the fuck?
That's his voice.

2693
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:38,940
Oh,
I love this.

2694
02:08:38,941 --> 02:08:39,774
I just hope that we do this.
This is so much better than fucking 

2695
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:45,870
elliptical machine for five and a half 
hours.

2696
02:08:45,950 --> 02:08:48,750
That was worth it though,
but not fuck that.

2697
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:50,340
Fuck that.
Most of the time,

2698
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:56,380
most of the time it was actually go fuck
to add pressure.

2699
02:08:57,330 --> 02:09:01,440
Next year we're surfing.
No one serves.

2700
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:06,470
No one can practice.
I promise I'm going to listen.

2701
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:08,170
Can we get coaches?
No,

2702
02:09:08,171 --> 02:09:08,661
no,
no,

2703
02:09:08,661 --> 02:09:09,220
no,
no.

2704
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:10,950
Me Garcia.
I want Brad Gerlach.

2705
02:09:11,330 --> 02:09:14,440
Whatever you want.
First name grew up wanting deserves.

2706
02:09:15,210 --> 02:09:17,940
Here's the deal.
You can do whatever you want.

2707
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,130
Once October.
Get started.

2708
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:22,290
If you want to hire a coach,
100 percent.

2709
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:24,360
Yo,
if you wanted higher up here.

2710
02:09:24,630 --> 02:09:26,790
I grew up next to closest sebastian 
inlet.

2711
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:30,240
Exactly where that is.
I like you.

2712
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:33,680
I never liked Keller.
What's up seven?

2713
02:09:33,690 --> 02:09:37,480
Seven to,
let's do coco case Kelly to Daytona,

2714
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:41,160
Shane Dorian or Kelly Slater,
teachers surfing,

2715
02:09:41,161 --> 02:09:46,161
because all the time probably a ton of 
real surfing instructors treat you,

2716
02:09:46,921 --> 02:09:47,754
bitch.
You ain't going to be a world champion 

2717
02:09:52,430 --> 02:09:57,430
teacher.
I got to sit down with you and there was

2718
02:10:07,561 --> 02:10:09,150
like,
and I'd like to try stand up.

2719
02:10:09,151 --> 02:10:09,984
Can you help me?
Right?

2720
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:12,040
Like,
no,

2721
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:18,390
let's not do that.
Oh,

2722
02:10:18,391 --> 02:10:22,050
I wouldn't need another drink.
This is the best.

2723
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:23,023
You know the drugs.
I remember one time with buzz when we 

2724
02:10:25,161 --> 02:10:26,570
went to Hawaii.
Yeah,

2725
02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:31,230
and by the way,
true.

2726
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:32,900
You did see that video

2727
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:37,160
video in the universe.
I'll just tell you,

2728
02:10:37,161 --> 02:10:39,170
it's better if you don't see it,
Tommy.

2729
02:10:39,190 --> 02:10:40,023
I,
I'm Tommy shaves my back and then he 

2730
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:44,670
goes back and I go,
Oh,

2731
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:47,320
I've seen that video I to,
to him.

2732
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:53,210
And then he went in Hawaii,
his tits.

2733
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:54,560
Beautiful job.
Oh,

2734
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:58,080
that makes me laugh to this day,
man.

2735
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:03,690
So a world tour and stadiums,
stadiums,

2736
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:05,633
arenas is a good start though.
The place where we can get arrested for 

2737
02:11:08,810 --> 02:11:10,100
ridiculous shit.
Where would you go?

2738
02:11:10,130 --> 02:11:11,620
Seriously if I said hey.
Um,

2739
02:11:11,690 --> 02:11:15,320
how's uh,
how's if we start in March,

2740
02:11:15,530 --> 02:11:20,180
you want to start doing some half our 
stadium sets or arena set?

2741
02:11:20,181 --> 02:11:21,170
Let's say arenas.
Yeah.

2742
02:11:21,171 --> 02:11:22,700
Let's figure out where we're going to 
go.

2743
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:25,520
Let's get together and sort this fucking
thing out.

2744
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:27,150
Boy.
Yeah.

2745
02:11:27,390 --> 02:11:32,390
That sounds to God damn fun here.
Let's start there.

2746
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:34,370
Start there.
Let's have some.

2747
02:11:34,371 --> 02:11:37,640
God Damn Madison Square Garden.
Let's start there.

2748
02:11:37,730 --> 02:11:39,960
Would you want to do staples center?
Like what would you want to.

2749
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:43,910
Have you ever had a calm and tell you 
for real?

2750
02:11:44,030 --> 02:11:47,420
Not Joking.
Sincere that you can't follow me.

2751
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:52,990
Oh No,
no.

2752
02:11:58,790 --> 02:12:00,830
In this room.
Oh No.

2753
02:12:01,370 --> 02:12:02,750
Wait,
what the fuck?

2754
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:06,800
Who says you have been?
It's not good because I can't say it.

2755
02:12:07,330 --> 02:12:09,190
I'll tell you off my.
Just whisper it.

2756
02:12:09,810 --> 02:12:12,700
Map it to us and we won't say it.
Say this.

2757
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:17,220
Can you say candyman candyman?
No Way.

2758
02:12:18,270 --> 02:12:23,010
We'll pass it to write it down and not 
even a chance underneath.

2759
02:12:24,510 --> 02:12:27,160
Know how paranoid I am.
Of course that's not gonna happen.

2760
02:12:27,810 --> 02:12:30,140
Let's just write it down.
Hey Tom.

2761
02:12:30,141 --> 02:12:31,580
Good for you.
Keeping it together.

2762
02:12:31,581 --> 02:12:36,370
Fucked up and drunk.
We can better.

2763
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:37,533
Totally.
About how should we have reservations 

2764
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:42,990
right now for ear whisper.
Whisper,

2765
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:44,510
whisper.
Phone booth.

2766
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:48,210
I'm not doing.
I'm not doing it.

2767
02:12:48,211 --> 02:12:51,150
I'm going to tell you bitches right now.
I take all my secrets.

2768
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:52,970
Tommy first.
Oh,

2769
02:12:52,971 --> 02:12:55,490
now on hard core.
He's holding onto him.

2770
02:12:55,670 --> 02:13:00,670
You bitches are loose lips.
His fault doesn't mean I have a bolt for

2771
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:03,320
both drunk.
Don't tell him.

2772
02:13:03,970 --> 02:13:05,750
Do not telling them no,
no,

2773
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:06,451
no,
no,

2774
02:13:06,451 --> 02:13:07,284
no,
no.

2775
02:13:07,370 --> 02:13:08,840
Fuck you guys.
I told you.

2776
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:10,363
Seriously.
I'll go through fucking CIA shit and I 

2777
02:13:12,861 --> 02:13:14,720
will not tell your secrets.
I promise you.

2778
02:13:14,721 --> 02:13:16,010
I believe you.
I promise you.

2779
02:13:16,070 --> 02:13:16,903
I promise you.
I believe you told me something was a 

2780
02:13:19,911 --> 02:13:21,870
secret secrets.
It's ridiculous.

2781
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:22,713
You told me this is a fucking secret.
People could break my fingers and I 

2782
02:13:25,551 --> 02:13:27,000
wouldn't tell them.
I promise you.

2783
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:29,180
I promise you.
What about you?

2784
02:13:29,870 --> 02:13:32,250
I'm not saying Shit for real.

2785
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:34,020
I'll tell you a secret.
You could tell you.

2786
02:13:34,030 --> 02:13:34,863
Oh Shit.
I'll tell you the actual order of who 

2787
02:13:37,531 --> 02:13:39,410
can keep a secret,
who cannot tell us.

2788
02:13:39,411 --> 02:13:40,860
Start with where.
Who's bad?

2789
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:45,210
Who's the worst of the worst.
Honestly,

2790
02:13:45,450 --> 02:13:46,283
and this is not an insult,
you should tell bird secrets if you 

2791
02:13:49,021 --> 02:13:51,540
wanted to get out,
but you don't want to come from you.

2792
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:53,980
It's like a source source.
Yeah,

2793
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:59,790
that's right.
Deep throats,

2794
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:02,930
visual secret time.

2795
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:06,170
Arctica and shit.
Bird.

2796
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:08,880
That's trick and secret briefcase.
Full of bullshit.

2797
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:09,390
I'm curious

2798
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:10,223
what's next?

2799
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:13,330
Blog.
Yeah.

2800
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:16,470
He puts him on next that you did not 
want to tell to Joe.

2801
02:14:16,471 --> 02:14:18,870
Rogan is next on that list.
I agree.

2802
02:14:19,850 --> 02:14:21,060
Keep a secret.
Sometimes.

2803
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:21,953
Sometimes you cannot file it into 
significance or it's possible though if 

2804
02:14:26,371 --> 02:14:29,520
you don't make it very clear that it's 
like fucking Goddamn it,

2805
02:14:30,150 --> 02:14:33,050
but I'm always looking out for your best
interest.

2806
02:14:33,330 --> 02:14:34,163
That is true.
He will always also a friend your 

2807
02:14:35,091 --> 02:14:35,610
friend.
Yeah,

2808
02:14:35,610 --> 02:14:36,443
I agree with that.
Til this point I always thought then I 

2809
02:14:39,001 --> 02:14:43,260
was the most vaulted,
but the way you talk make me think.

2810
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:44,573
He might also be have my understanding 
of what someone shared something with 

2811
02:14:48,241 --> 02:14:52,560
you that just dies with you.
If you tell me that that dies with me,

2812
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:53,573
I will never betray you.
Well that's true with it out once it's 

2813
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:57,990
out to everybody and be like,
oh,

2814
02:14:57,991 --> 02:15:00,530
just so you know,
I knew about that 12 years ago,

2815
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:05,180
but there's also different levels of 
people telling you something and there's

2816
02:15:05,181 --> 02:15:07,520
stuff where like you make the judgment,
you're like,

2817
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:08,490
listen bullshit.

2818
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:10,050
And then there's stuff where you're 
like,

2819
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:11,003
this is a little more serious for 
somebody tells you something and it's 

2820
02:15:14,371 --> 02:15:16,350
actually something that could affect 
their life.

2821
02:15:16,380 --> 02:15:17,213
Yes.
And there's a zero percent chance I 

2822
02:15:18,721 --> 02:15:19,554
would ever use your head.
Don't say that I ever told me something 

2823
02:15:24,570 --> 02:15:26,210
like severe.
Yeah.

2824
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:28,320
Yeah.
I promised you would never have to worry

2825
02:15:28,321 --> 02:15:31,860
about me saying anything to her after a 
couple kids.

2826
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:34,290
What's that like?
I've jumped off a couple of kids.

2827
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:35,160
Fine.
Don't say it this.

2828
02:15:35,161 --> 02:15:35,700
Okay,
cool.

2829
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:40,680
Can we talk about this?
But if one reality is that sometimes one

2830
02:15:40,681 --> 02:15:42,840
of your friends will say something 
that's disturbing.

2831
02:15:42,950 --> 02:15:45,250
Yeah.
And you're not sure if you.

2832
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:47,480
You have talked to somebody about it.
Oh,

2833
02:15:47,481 --> 02:15:50,120
like I think about killing myself or 
like.

2834
02:15:50,170 --> 02:15:52,680
Yeah,
but I'm not thinking.

2835
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:56,910
I'm not saying this in terms of that had
these kinds of conversations.

2836
02:15:57,920 --> 02:15:58,753
Do I talk to people?

2837
02:15:59,050 --> 02:16:01,230
Didn't understand how to deal with that.
I,

2838
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:03,550
I didn't know anybody who'd,
who did,

2839
02:16:04,130 --> 02:16:06,130
who had gone to that place?
Yeah.

2840
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:08,850
I'm close to killing myself.
Place,

2841
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:09,710
you know,
I've,

2842
02:16:09,710 --> 02:16:10,543
I don't.
I've known people that have killed 

2843
02:16:11,581 --> 02:16:14,400
themselves,
but I never knew anybody who confided in

2844
02:16:14,401 --> 02:16:16,230
me that they were thinking of killing 
them.

2845
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:17,610
Yeah.
I've never had that either.

2846
02:16:18,750 --> 02:16:20,760
No one is close.
As you and I were,

2847
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:23,790
you and I had spent so much fun time 
together.

2848
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:26,910
So much traveling on the road together.
So many gigs.

2849
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:29,800
We had a lot of fun,
so I.

2850
02:16:29,850 --> 02:16:31,750
I didn't understand.
I was like,

2851
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:36,220
you were really hilarious comedian.
You're a professional comedian who doing

2852
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:39,500
what we all want to do.
Everything is happening and then you're,

2853
02:16:39,501 --> 02:16:40,334
you're depressed.
I'm like,

2854
02:16:40,350 --> 02:16:42,250
there's a.
here's a situation going on.

2855
02:16:42,430 --> 02:16:45,280
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but it doesn't make any sense to me.

2856
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:46,091
Yeah.
No,

2857
02:16:46,091 --> 02:16:49,000
I didn't.
I've never had anybody confide in me.

2858
02:16:49,090 --> 02:16:50,760
Like that's a different kind of 
confided.

2859
02:16:50,761 --> 02:16:51,594
That's when you're like,
let me make the best one I think is the 

2860
02:16:53,261 --> 02:16:56,530
decision instead of just going like,
I don't want to share this.

2861
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:57,620
Yeah,
of course.

2862
02:16:57,620 --> 02:16:58,560
It's fun.
It was.

2863
02:16:58,750 --> 02:16:59,370
No,
that's it.

2864
02:16:59,370 --> 02:17:00,410
That's different than,
you're fine,

2865
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:04,300
you're fine on that.
You opened up about some shit that I was

2866
02:17:04,301 --> 02:17:04,990
like,
okay,

2867
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:06,200
I don't,
I,

2868
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:07,073
I can't be responsible for this.
Just based on my own personal judgment 

2869
02:17:09,641 --> 02:17:11,830
because I don't,
I don't understand this that well.

2870
02:17:12,130 --> 02:17:14,260
And I was like,
I got to figure out what to do.

2871
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:15,243
And then I reached out to friends who 
told me about psychiatrists and then we 

2872
02:17:19,511 --> 02:17:22,590
got together and we.
But you're fine with that.

2873
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:24,760
That's making the decision to like,
oh,

2874
02:17:24,761 --> 02:17:26,210
that's a good share information.
Yeah,

2875
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:26,950
definitely.
You're like,

2876
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:28,750
hold on,
let me think about that.

2877
02:17:28,750 --> 02:17:30,820
I'm talking about secret.
Yeah.

2878
02:17:30,821 --> 02:17:31,654
My thing is,
if you're going to make me find out for 

2879
02:17:32,891 --> 02:17:35,110
myself,
I'm going to tell fucking everybody,

2880
02:17:35,410 --> 02:17:36,243
but if you tell me,
if I tell you you're going to respect 

2881
02:17:37,721 --> 02:17:38,700
it,
I will absolutely spend.

2882
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:39,553
I think you and I are on the same level 
with that where it's not a question of 

2883
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:44,670
what the line is,
is just know if.

2884
02:17:45,130 --> 02:17:45,880
Exactly.
If some.

2885
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:48,310
Especially like if I were to tell you 
this is a no,

2886
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:50,470
you've never fucked me up on it.
Don't even be a question.

2887
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:51,490
Of course wouldn't come out.

2888
02:17:51,590 --> 02:17:52,423
Yeah.
Unless someone brings it up in 

2889
02:17:52,851 --> 02:17:54,320
conversation and you're like,
oh yeah,

2890
02:17:54,321 --> 02:17:57,650
of course this happened.
If you tell me no barriers so much,

2891
02:17:57,651 --> 02:18:02,651
I don't even think about it.
I would sell you or sell you out.

2892
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:06,030
I would not tell you.
I believe I've never send someone out to

2893
02:18:06,140 --> 02:18:07,160
exempt judgment calls

2894
02:18:07,630 --> 02:18:10,260
sentence whether here's the thing that's
true and I am here.

2895
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:13,190
They tell me to not say anything.
You just got to be clear.

2896
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:17,170
I appreciate that level of a friendship 
to where somebody goes.

2897
02:18:17,350 --> 02:18:19,450
I will call you out on some bullshit.
I also,

2898
02:18:19,451 --> 02:18:21,370
I'll say this.
I think burt,

2899
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:25,480
if you told him this is a definitely a 
secret.

2900
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:27,400
Yes.
He would definitely not sell you.

2901
02:18:27,410 --> 02:18:28,430
I high.
That's

2902
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:29,850
great.
No,

2903
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:31,360
no,
don't tell him that.

2904
02:18:31,630 --> 02:18:32,380
No,
no,

2905
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:35,480
no.
It's been out one time.

2906
02:18:35,780 --> 02:18:37,370
One Times.
Bug Son.

2907
02:18:39,860 --> 02:18:40,940
One time.
One time.

2908
02:18:40,941 --> 02:18:45,640
I gave up already within 12 hours.
I've never ever told you this.

2909
02:18:45,790 --> 02:18:47,600
He told me to see her,
but I didn't understand it.

2910
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:48,523
Like I understood that it was a secret,
but he didn't say it was the way you 

2911
02:18:50,650 --> 02:18:51,770
wanted it to be.
A secret.

2912
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:53,330
This time we went hiking and I was like,
Hey,

2913
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:54,193
I have a secret height.
Can I trust you to not share the hype 

2914
02:18:55,821 --> 02:18:57,680
with you that you won't share with 
anyone?

2915
02:18:57,681 --> 02:18:58,431
And you're like,
yeah,

2916
02:18:58,431 --> 02:18:59,240
whatever,
man.

2917
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:04,240
I'm translation.
What the fuck did you say?

2918
02:19:04,790 --> 02:19:05,810
A secret.
What?

2919
02:19:05,870 --> 02:19:07,310
Say it again?
He had a secret.

2920
02:19:07,370 --> 02:19:10,250
I don't know what I said.
He said I had a secret.

2921
02:19:10,370 --> 02:19:13,750
Who did you start sharing secrets with?
You told me a secret.

2922
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:16,240
Well,
October and,

2923
02:19:16,330 --> 02:19:18,080
and he and he goes,
don't tell anyone.

2924
02:19:18,081 --> 02:19:22,460
And within 12 hours I told the secret.
I didn't even know.

2925
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:23,353
I don't even know that I told it.
I don't remember that you don't care 

2926
02:19:25,931 --> 02:19:28,040
about.
It's does not important

2927
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,820
to me.
It's not a,

2928
02:19:28,820 --> 02:19:31,080
it's not a real secret.
You the other day,

2929
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:33,400
I'm not gonna say who buy more on 
everything,

2930
02:19:33,410 --> 02:19:36,470
you know,
but like I've told more secrets.

2931
02:19:36,471 --> 02:19:37,304
Should you not be about to tell me this 
because it seems like someone's secret 

2932
02:19:39,531 --> 02:19:40,820
and you're like,
I get what you're saying.

2933
02:19:40,990 --> 02:19:43,250
I'm going,
I'm going to say he did say that.

2934
02:19:43,251 --> 02:19:44,084
He goes,
maybe you should never tell anyone what 

2935
02:19:45,651 --> 02:19:47,600
you're going to want to hear about us 
and knows he's joined it.

2936
02:19:47,601 --> 02:19:48,434
Hear about it.
But just from your point of view for a 

2937
02:19:49,461 --> 02:19:50,294
second,
it seems like you're worried about 

2938
02:19:51,651 --> 02:19:55,580
telling this guy secret.
You being able to say nosy Jew is such a

2939
02:19:55,581 --> 02:19:59,890
beautiful thing because it lets you set 
your nosy brow.

2940
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:02,930
Really no one else in this room can say 
it.

2941
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:04,910
We're a nosy people,
but it's a,

2942
02:20:04,911 --> 02:20:07,130
it's a.
You have a free path.

2943
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:09,130
A prepass too.
Nosy Ju.

2944
02:20:09,150 --> 02:20:09,983
Yeah.
Yeah.

2945
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:10,820
No.
See,

2946
02:20:10,820 --> 02:20:15,790
I barely say it in reference to my 
friend.

2947
02:20:16,690 --> 02:20:19,190
Me saying you saying it,
you get me in trouble.

2948
02:20:19,390 --> 02:20:22,460
It's not quite the n word,
but it is the j word.

2949
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:24,571
It's like,
you know,

2950
02:20:24,571 --> 02:20:28,890
like it's like low in the my zone 
points.

2951
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:36,530
Straight red.
That's red.

2952
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:39,660
What's yellow?
That's my favorite.

2953
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:42,110
My favorite hands down.
What the fuck?

2954
02:20:42,111 --> 02:20:47,111
I just said show the uh,
going to be okay.

2955
02:20:47,211 --> 02:20:48,044
Folks Square Garden made my favorite.
Edward argument is when like the old 

2956
02:20:53,031 --> 02:20:55,120
guy,
the old white guy goes like,

2957
02:20:55,580 --> 02:20:57,050
well,
why can they say it?

2958
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:01,640
Green light or that guy's super racist 
that he's like,

2959
02:21:01,910 --> 02:21:03,050
he's like,
I don't get it.

2960
02:21:03,170 --> 02:21:05,870
Give me an explanation.
Why do you want to just stop saying it?

2961
02:21:05,871 --> 02:21:09,110
But it's like,
why are you pretending you need that?

2962
02:21:09,111 --> 02:21:09,944
Explained to you what's the most 
underlooked racist thing in this 

2963
02:21:13,851 --> 02:21:15,920
country?
Asians and Harvard,

2964
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:18,613
they literally just like this past year,
they literally make it more difficult 

2965
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:23,323
for Asians to get into Harvard.
Didn't than anyone else because so many 

2966
02:21:26,061 --> 02:21:28,790
of them getting in,
which was amazing.

2967
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:30,343
Super performance.
It'd be all Asian and then 23 percent 

2968
02:21:35,630 --> 02:21:40,630
is.
That course is much of crazy.

2969
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:48,130
I thought the men,
they'll remember it.

2970
02:21:49,830 --> 02:21:52,700
Was this like this when you were growing
up,

2971
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:56,380
were like in my high school,
the standards for the,

2972
02:21:56,430 --> 02:21:57,263
like the standards that Asian families 
put on their Asian children through the 

2973
02:22:01,131 --> 02:22:02,990
roof,
they were,

2974
02:22:03,020 --> 02:22:08,020
we had a top 10 thing they give away.
It was 80 to 90 percent Asian.

2975
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:09,193
Well,
you know,

2976
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:14,280
I literally grew up from 15 to 21 around
a ton of Korean people.

2977
02:22:14,780 --> 02:22:16,310
Bertrand 53 last week.

2978
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:22,380
Run a ton of Asian people.
Yeah,

2979
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:25,400
they're worth work ethic is insane.

2980
02:22:26,630 --> 02:22:29,610
The way they problem solve is different.
So when we lived,

2981
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:30,630
we went to a Korean,
uh,

2982
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:35,340
grade school and ga and Eila would have 
a hard time doing homework with Leanne.

2983
02:22:35,341 --> 02:22:37,630
And one time one of the Korean moms 
goes,

2984
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:39,930
why don't you just switch up?
That's what we do.

2985
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:40,823
We never do homework with our children 
because our children won't give us what 

2986
02:22:43,411 --> 02:22:44,244
they need,
but they'll give a stranger what they 

2987
02:22:45,391 --> 02:22:48,690
need.
Korean moms were switching up and doing.

2988
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:53,730
The moms were different.
Kids to Asians are next level.

2989
02:22:53,970 --> 02:22:57,270
Next level.
Do you see Assad mythologist thing?

2990
02:22:57,480 --> 02:23:02,480
What did you say?
You play that back over,

2991
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:11,260
sir?
I said you guys my registration.

2992
02:23:12,991 --> 02:23:17,991
Proof of insurance.
Hassan Minhaj fuck man.

2993
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:20,550
Work with you.
Is he a friend of yours?

2994
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:23,940
Why don't you know how to say his name 
was?

2995
02:23:24,510 --> 02:23:27,000
He's great,
but party coming from birthday party.

2996
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:28,530
The homicide,
he's.

2997
02:23:28,590 --> 02:23:33,590
He's a great comic is.
I don't know if it's funny per se,

2998
02:23:34,831 --> 02:23:36,690
but it's really good.
I haven't seen it either.

2999
02:23:36,750 --> 02:23:38,130
It's really good.
It's the thing on.

3000
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:42,210
But that's what it is.
First thing is about a whatever.

3001
02:23:42,211 --> 02:23:43,260
Dude.
I'm fucking hammered.

3002
02:23:43,490 --> 02:23:44,830
Am I gonna?
Try to talk like this.

3003
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:47,140
He said,
hey you guys,

3004
02:23:49,190 --> 02:23:53,940
have you guys seen I just want to go to 
go to surf camp?

3005
02:23:53,990 --> 02:23:55,140
No.
No surf camps.

3006
02:23:55,190 --> 02:23:56,023
Remember,
we can't do any surfing until October 

3007
02:23:59,311 --> 02:24:00,160
first.
Okay.

3008
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:01,840
Let me ask you guys a question.
Shoot.

3009
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:04,680
This is what Nicky said.
I want her to show after after this.

3010
02:24:04,681 --> 02:24:05,371
And she goes,
yeah.

3011
02:24:05,371 --> 02:24:06,280
She goes,
what's your say?

3012
02:24:06,570 --> 02:24:07,403
It seemed like these guys all decided 
we're going to do some thing and they 

3013
02:24:09,841 --> 02:24:10,980
called you and you're like,
what?

3014
02:24:11,010 --> 02:24:13,830
No fuck.
All of you know what?

3015
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:18,980
What was the plan to come to Las Vegas 
Pis and flying.

3016
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:20,343
By the way,
everything was set until your fucking 

3017
02:24:22,081 --> 02:24:22,980
ass.
Get on the phone.

3018
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,960
Thanks.
Everybody was in agreement with voice.

3019
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:29,040
Listen,
I've been a friend for a long time.

3020
02:24:29,220 --> 02:24:32,200
He's treating me out sometimes.
He realized right now you'd be on a Gulf

3021
02:24:32,201 --> 02:24:35,610
stream.
Fucking [inaudible] man.

3022
02:24:36,050 --> 02:24:38,580
Stop.
I turned to for advice guys.

3023
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:41,400
I'll reward though.
We should have a reward.

3024
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:44,340
I got.
I got something out of this.

3025
02:24:45,020 --> 02:24:45,853
We're going to present you with the belt
is working to get that there on the 

3026
02:24:48,151 --> 02:24:53,151
stack of weed.
I would like to say pulp fiction bottom,

3027
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:55,710
my instagram for more details.
Okay.

3028
02:24:55,770 --> 02:24:56,431
Okay.
Actually,

3029
02:24:56,431 --> 02:24:59,100
let's present the pulp fit.
It's more like creep show.

3030
02:24:59,110 --> 02:25:01,590
That's without the werewolf that lives 
under the stairs.

3031
02:25:01,620 --> 02:25:04,290
Creep shows they perfect.
That is perfect.

3032
02:25:04,291 --> 02:25:06,930
No damn crate.
That's the creative creep show.

3033
02:25:08,470 --> 02:25:09,990
Felt so bad.
Okay.

3034
02:25:10,270 --> 02:25:11,103
I would like to ladies and gentlemen 
work for this people to present this 

3035
02:25:14,851 --> 02:25:16,740
belt.
Thank you very much.

3036
02:25:16,770 --> 02:25:19,620
The ultimate,
by the way,

3037
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:22,330
the fact that we actually did this was 
nuts,

3038
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:24,040
nuts,
and I would like to

3039
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:28,870
say on behalf of me,
one of the three non winners,

3040
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:34,000
I won't say losers of the sober October 
of fitness challenge Joe Rogan,

3041
02:25:34,330 --> 02:25:38,980
much like Jesus before him where there 
was nothing,

3042
02:25:38,981 --> 02:25:39,814
and then there was winning Joe Rogan.
You have achieved the champion of 

3043
02:25:45,461 --> 02:25:47,020
Sobrato October.
Physical Challenge.

3044
02:25:47,290 --> 02:25:49,480
I already should.
Fear presents you,

3045
02:25:49,630 --> 02:25:54,630
Joe Rogan.
This belt saying you are the champion of

3046
02:25:57,341 --> 02:26:00,700
sober October.
I just want to stay for the record.

3047
02:26:00,701 --> 02:26:01,534
I was most impressed by you and then if 
you had been exercising as long as I 

3048
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:07,510
probably would have died trying to 
defeat you.

3049
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:11,950
Great job.
I.

3050
02:26:11,950 --> 02:26:13,030
Yes sir.
I was not impressed.

3051
02:26:13,060 --> 02:26:14,920
Come on over to present the belts.
Well,

3052
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:16,720
it's already on.
I'll just say this.

3053
02:26:16,721 --> 02:26:17,554
I was a joe you showed us.
Definitely what time it was was all 

3054
02:26:20,830 --> 02:26:24,370
second place and you definitely got 
that,

3055
02:26:24,371 --> 02:26:27,040
so congratulations to you Ari,
but Joe,

3056
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:30,490
your in better.
Here's a huge shocker.

3057
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:32,890
You're in better shape than the three of
us.

3058
02:26:34,270 --> 02:26:37,390
I think that had a factor.
That was certainly a part of it.

3059
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:39,280
How much energy you could put out.
We.

3060
02:26:39,281 --> 02:26:40,180
I'll put it in though,
man.

3061
02:26:40,210 --> 02:26:43,120
We all worked our ass off,
but it's ultimately is about trt.

3062
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:48,180
Is that tight enough or not even like an
advertisement?

3063
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:51,940
I'd love.
At some point we're like,

3064
02:26:51,941 --> 02:26:52,774
hey,
really does go to show you the steroids 

3065
02:26:54,341 --> 02:26:55,700
could help it.
Athletic Challenges.

3066
02:26:55,701 --> 02:26:57,610
This is why it's illegal.
They have chemicals.

3067
02:26:57,611 --> 02:27:00,880
Now you've had doctors tell you get on 
it.

3068
02:27:01,460 --> 02:27:02,293
Oh,
100 percent.

3069
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:03,133
Yeah.
I've had several particular at a 

3070
02:27:06,390 --> 02:27:07,223
certain.
There's a certain point you cross over 

3071
02:27:09,111 --> 02:27:09,944
as a person where you go,
how much time do I have left to have 40 

3072
02:27:14,421 --> 02:27:16,070
years left for 50 years.

3073
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:17,950
Wait,
when did you first have that thought?

3074
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:20,740
I mean,
I know you can have many times.

3075
02:27:20,770 --> 02:27:22,300
Let's say when you took it seriously.
Sleep.

3076
02:27:23,550 --> 02:27:25,450
30 something.
When I was in my thirties,

3077
02:27:25,451 --> 02:27:28,450
I would see my body not responding as 
well,

3078
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:29,900
and I was like,
oh,

3079
02:27:29,901 --> 02:27:30,734
where's this going?
That was when I really started thinking 

3080
02:27:32,831 --> 02:27:34,670
about it.
Yeah,

3081
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:35,170
yeah,
yeah.

3082
02:27:35,170 --> 02:27:35,890
Because,
uh,

3083
02:27:35,890 --> 02:27:39,680
I started seeing like I was working out 
really hard and uh,

3084
02:27:40,610 --> 02:27:41,443
and as a boxing fan,
I always knew when a really good boxer 

3085
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:48,910
got into their thirties,
you had to keep an eye on them.

3086
02:27:48,980 --> 02:27:51,070
They might sour instantly.
Yeah.

3087
02:27:51,130 --> 02:27:51,963
They might get knocked out all of a 
sudden and they couldn't take a punch 

3088
02:27:54,010 --> 02:27:56,140
anymore.
There's this guy named Doug Dewitt,

3089
02:27:56,490 --> 02:27:57,323
he was like this bad ass middleweight.
He just could take a punch like nobody 

3090
02:28:00,491 --> 02:28:01,324
else.
Man.

3091
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:02,253
It was crazy.
Like this guy could just bang on the 

3092
02:28:04,421 --> 02:28:06,580
Chin and people would be freaking out,
like,

3093
02:28:06,730 --> 02:28:08,920
how does this guy take punches like 
this?

3094
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:10,960
And then one day he couldn't take them 
anymore.

3095
02:28:11,710 --> 02:28:12,543
They just,
it was a cumulative effect of all the 

3096
02:28:14,351 --> 02:28:16,390
punches landed.
But it was also an age,

3097
02:28:16,570 --> 02:28:17,403
like almost all of the great champions.
They get into their thirties and they 

3098
02:28:20,261 --> 02:28:22,040
just fall.
They start

3099
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:24,110
to slide where you freaked out.
I mean,

3100
02:28:24,111 --> 02:28:24,944
at the or I don't know how much,
how much did you question hormone 

3101
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:31,910
replacement or anything like that?
Like did you freak out about the thought

3102
02:28:31,911 --> 02:28:32,680
of it or you know,

3103
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:33,513
I didn't freak out about it.
I just wanted to see like what do smart 

3104
02:28:36,151 --> 02:28:38,550
people who studied that think like what 
do they think?

3105
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:40,410
And they were all,
how was it there?

3106
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:43,420
There's a bunch of things you can do,
like this is like,

3107
02:28:43,830 --> 02:28:45,480
and we talked about this,
we were talking about,

3108
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:48,890
um,
if,

3109
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:51,930
if you've got a good doctor,
they're not going to just put you on any

3110
02:28:51,931 --> 02:28:52,764
kind of hormone replacement first.
First thing they're going to do is 

3111
02:28:55,561 --> 02:28:59,010
exercise you.
You're going to check your blood,

3112
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:01,860
they get a check.
Your vitamin levels are going to ask you

3113
02:29:01,861 --> 02:29:03,900
what you eat,
how much do you sleep?

3114
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:06,030
You know,
how stressful is your life?

3115
02:29:06,220 --> 02:29:08,610
They're going to try to sort things out 
that way first.

3116
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:12,630
That way your body is at a more optimum 
level.

3117
02:29:12,690 --> 02:29:14,850
And for a lot of people that's all they 
need.

3118
02:29:15,030 --> 02:29:18,210
They just need more sleep,
less sugar,

3119
02:29:18,870 --> 02:29:20,460
less processed foods.

3120
02:29:20,790 --> 02:29:22,610
You know,
do a little weight lifting,

3121
02:29:22,650 --> 02:29:24,660
do some squats,
dead lifts,

3122
02:29:24,661 --> 02:29:27,840
things that boost your testosterone and 
maybe you're a 34,

3123
02:29:27,841 --> 02:29:30,840
we just tired after work and you can 
kick that shit back into gear.

3124
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:33,150
Cut out the milkshakes and all the 
bullshit.

3125
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:34,240
Yeah,
you could probably kick it,

3126
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:37,770
kick it into gear,
but then there's guys that are like 49,

3127
02:29:38,070 --> 02:29:39,930
50,
51,

3128
02:29:39,960 --> 02:29:40,793
57 and they're just fucking tired.
They're just tired and they go and 

3129
02:29:45,791 --> 02:29:47,010
there's,
here's your options.

3130
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:48,053
You can keep being tired or you can get 
your testosterone replaced and you're 

3131
02:29:52,171 --> 02:29:54,690
not as tired anymore.
He feel like a person.

3132
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:55,913
You feel like an actual person,
not like a decaying person because 

3133
02:29:59,401 --> 02:30:00,234
that's a lot of what makes you feel like
a decaying person is a body's lack of 

3134
02:30:03,871 --> 02:30:06,330
production of hormones and this is 
what's really important.

3135
02:30:07,750 --> 02:30:08,583
They they think this is the case with a 
lot of people that have had head 

3136
02:30:10,891 --> 02:30:11,724
injuries.

3137
02:30:11,790 --> 02:30:12,623
I think this is one of the key factor in
depression for people that have been in 

3138
02:30:16,141 --> 02:30:18,300
car accidents.
People who had been beat up,

3139
02:30:18,480 --> 02:30:21,000
people that have been,
that have had a lot of head injuries,

3140
02:30:21,270 --> 02:30:24,720
your by stopped producing a lot of your 
hormones correctly,

3141
02:30:24,860 --> 02:30:27,150
[inaudible] your pituitary gland gets 
damaged.

3142
02:30:28,380 --> 02:30:31,170
So for all those reasons,
like at a certain point in time,

3143
02:30:31,171 --> 02:30:36,171
whether it's 50 or 60 or 70 or 80,
you got one except your mortality and to

3144
02:30:37,831 --> 02:30:38,664
accept the idea that there are certain 
things that have been discovered 

3145
02:30:41,971 --> 02:30:45,840
scientifically that can enhance the time
that you have left.

3146
02:30:45,870 --> 02:30:46,703
Right.
So you either you either like dive into 

3147
02:30:50,971 --> 02:30:51,804
them and listen to science and an 
experiment trying to figure out what 

3148
02:30:55,770 --> 02:30:58,200
works best for you or you don't know 
it's up to you.

3149
02:30:59,020 --> 02:31:03,880
This month was a real introspection into
the like watching a.

3150
02:31:04,390 --> 02:31:05,890
I literally was like.
I was like,

3151
02:31:05,891 --> 02:31:08,680
man,
I think my lifestyle.

3152
02:31:08,681 --> 02:31:11,140
There's a lot of things that I could fix
before I added things.

3153
02:31:11,141 --> 02:31:12,730
You know,
if you know what I mean.

3154
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:15,010
Like get off blood pressure medicine and
drink less,

3155
02:31:15,130 --> 02:31:17,680
but it's huge.
You would.

3156
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:18,880
They would a good,

3157
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:24,510
a really ethical doctor would go to that
immediately.

3158
02:31:24,511 --> 02:31:25,980
That would be the first thing they would
go to.

3159
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:28,830
They would say,
you got to just fix that because listen,

3160
02:31:28,831 --> 02:31:30,450
you run a fucking marathon,
man.

3161
02:31:31,570 --> 02:31:32,970
Yeah.
It sound like you're a loser.

3162
02:31:33,450 --> 02:31:34,283
You're a fucking guy with an iron.
Will you figured out a way to run a 

3163
02:31:36,961 --> 02:31:39,990
marathon when very little training,
you know,

3164
02:31:40,350 --> 02:31:42,630
and then you did.
What does that stupid Spartan race thing

3165
02:31:42,631 --> 02:31:43,464
that shouldn't say stupid ridiculous 
Spartan race running around throwing 

3166
02:31:48,091 --> 02:31:50,130
fucking sand bags and shit.
Like what are you doing?

3167
02:31:50,250 --> 02:31:51,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

3168
02:31:51,690 --> 02:31:53,370
Like you do a lot of Shit,
man.

3169
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:57,990
I like to think I'm very goal oriented.
Like if I set a goal and I do go,

3170
02:31:57,991 --> 02:31:59,130
oh,
I got that coming up.

3171
02:31:59,400 --> 02:32:01,890
I think it helps me.
I'm not the kind of person that you just

3172
02:32:02,360 --> 02:32:04,770
kind of float in the water and not know 
what I'm doing.

3173
02:32:04,860 --> 02:32:05,693
I think it helps everybody.
We're just unnerved by the expectations 

3174
02:32:09,570 --> 02:32:12,330
of any kind of challenges that we 
subscribe to.

3175
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:13,680
We just decide,
okay,

3176
02:32:13,681 --> 02:32:16,320
we're all going to agree the whole month
of October,

3177
02:32:16,410 --> 02:32:17,243
we're just going to go crazy and do 
cardio five hours a fucking day and try 

3178
02:32:20,371 --> 02:32:23,450
to kill each other,
pushing each other.

3179
02:32:25,070 --> 02:32:26,840
It was great.
It was great.

3180
02:32:27,250 --> 02:32:29,250
It was a 100 day.
I heard that one.

3181
02:32:29,251 --> 02:32:32,330
10 and one surfing.
Surfing,

3182
02:32:33,310 --> 02:32:35,400
surfing,
surfing would be really weird.

3183
02:32:35,460 --> 02:32:37,410
Did you discover anything through 
sobriety?

3184
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:40,100
You know,
here's what I discovered.

3185
02:32:40,990 --> 02:32:44,680
Sobriety thing is good.
It's good pipes,

3186
02:32:44,970 --> 02:32:45,803
but what's more important is 
understanding how different everything 

3187
02:32:50,041 --> 02:32:53,310
feels when you work out for four hours 
or whatever it was.

3188
02:32:53,311 --> 02:32:56,070
The average.
If you looked at the whole month,

3189
02:32:56,071 --> 02:32:58,900
I probably worked out for hours.
Yeah.

3190
02:32:59,110 --> 02:33:00,990
No,
I mean I probably did.

3191
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:03,000
There was not a five and a half hour 
days.

3192
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:04,260
There was,
um,

3193
02:33:04,290 --> 02:33:07,710
there was quite a few three hour 
sessions,

3194
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:11,850
three hour sessions at night and he did 
a lot of weights also.

3195
02:33:11,851 --> 02:33:15,540
Which points but gave you like fucking 
tons of time.

3196
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:17,730
Well,
for me it wasn't even that.

3197
02:33:17,731 --> 02:33:18,564
It was like,
I just have to mix it up or I'll go 

3198
02:33:19,861 --> 02:33:20,760
crazy.
Yeah.

3199
02:33:20,761 --> 02:33:22,740
There were times at the end of a workout
to where I'd be like,

3200
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:25,470
I don't care if it's not,
I want to do fucking something else.

3201
02:33:25,471 --> 02:33:29,130
I wanted to some weights.
It was also was a.

3202
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:32,910
It was a thing where I was in this weird
high state,

3203
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:36,060
this weird post long workout,
high state,

3204
02:33:36,061 --> 02:33:36,894
and I just wanted to keep it going.
I just wanted to keep like flowing and 

3205
02:33:40,801 --> 02:33:41,634
relaxing.
While it was like lifting weights and 

3206
02:33:43,291 --> 02:33:47,460
doing kettlebell swings and shit.
I just wanted to do something else.

3207
02:33:47,461 --> 02:33:51,570
I wanted to do chin ups I want to do 
something was just moving my body almost

3208
02:33:51,571 --> 02:33:53,760
as if I was a cooling it down.
After all that,

3209
02:33:54,090 --> 02:33:57,840
all that exercise,
it was bananas,

3210
02:33:57,870 --> 02:33:59,220
man.
After it was over,

3211
02:33:59,221 --> 02:34:00,810
I was like,
what the fuck happened?

3212
02:34:00,811 --> 02:34:02,400
What did we do?
It was like we got,

3213
02:34:02,430 --> 02:34:05,820
we got possessed by a wizard spell and 
all of a sudden,

3214
02:34:05,821 --> 02:34:06,654
where were we?
We we hit zero point one percent of all 

3215
02:34:11,461 --> 02:34:12,294
the people using this fucking thing.
I went down to that fucking gym and I 

3216
02:34:15,181 --> 02:34:15,691
was like,
Hey,

3217
02:34:15,691 --> 02:34:17,970
I want to sign up for whatever it but 
are things like I'm

3218
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:21,250
just to start working out right now.
So logged me in.

3219
02:34:21,251 --> 02:34:22,084
Harvey knew too,

3220
02:34:22,930 --> 02:34:24,340
work it out.
I got it.

3221
02:34:24,670 --> 02:34:29,670
Is that for middle aged comedians?
Zero.

3222
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:32,913
Zero point one percent.
I'm obese according to all the zero 

3223
02:34:35,991 --> 02:34:40,991
point one percent plus metrics without 
his nuts that we worked that hard.

3224
02:34:42,770 --> 02:34:44,660
So hard.
I can't believe it,

3225
02:34:44,661 --> 02:34:47,930
man.
All the time running in the hills.

3226
02:34:48,050 --> 02:34:50,420
Say that you were gonna double meat.
That's all I needed.

3227
02:34:50,570 --> 02:34:53,360
A fucking idiot.
This is a day of death

3228
02:34:54,090 --> 02:34:54,923
want.
Don't you want to tug on the Tiger's 

3229
02:34:56,101 --> 02:34:58,610
tail?
Do you want to tug on the dog?

3230
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:02,800
We're going to go down the dark road per
crash.

3231
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:04,490
So there was a thing.
There was a thing.

3232
02:35:05,030 --> 02:35:07,830
When Tami goes back,
you got to play the Nikki glaser clip.

3233
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:09,880
It's just,
it's,

3234
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:11,170
Oh,
I'm guarantee you.

3235
02:35:11,180 --> 02:35:13,220
It's all my instagram.
I.

3236
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:15,270
It helped me to have you around.
Yeah.

3237
02:35:15,570 --> 02:35:17,730
When Tom got 602,
so me and Bert,

3238
02:35:17,790 --> 02:35:19,260
when he got sick it was like,
okay,

3239
02:35:19,261 --> 02:35:19,921
cool.
He's done.

3240
02:35:19,921 --> 02:35:23,490
We both separated ourselves from buy 
about 700 and then we're like,

3241
02:35:23,940 --> 02:35:25,710
hey,
we talked to were like,

3242
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:26,753
uh,
looks like Tom's out pretty much were 

3243
02:35:28,051 --> 02:35:29,350
like looking at the toms out.
It was like,

3244
02:35:29,351 --> 02:35:29,911
yeah,
that's cool.

3245
02:35:29,911 --> 02:35:32,640
So we're not coming last because it was 
a big fear and then you say,

3246
02:35:33,260 --> 02:35:34,680
yeah,
I'm still gonna try to beat you though.

3247
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:35,251
I'm like,
yeah,

3248
02:35:35,251 --> 02:35:36,930
I mean good luck,
but you're not going to fucking do it.

3249
02:35:37,290 --> 02:35:38,190
And it was just like,
oh,

3250
02:35:38,191 --> 02:35:39,510
okay,
we're still going to go on.

3251
02:35:39,930 --> 02:35:42,170
It's still going to be one with a 
fucking challenge to you.

3252
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:43,410
I can't,
I can't.

3253
02:35:43,560 --> 02:35:44,393
I have to pay more compliments than 
anything in this because already should 

3254
02:35:47,281 --> 02:35:52,281
fear really that you really changed my 
perspective of working out like of going

3255
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:53,793
the way I go.
If I get into spin class and the guard 

3256
02:35:55,470 --> 02:35:58,260
sat on the saddle and you're paddling,
I go,

3257
02:35:58,490 --> 02:36:02,190
it will be still out right now.
Like that's the way your brain works.

3258
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:03,120
It's different,
man.

3259
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:05,130
I used to race with yoga too.
They're like,

3260
02:36:05,131 --> 02:36:05,964
you guys do all the poses.
I'm gonna fucking fat legs to get my 

3261
02:36:09,211 --> 02:36:12,280
fucking feet around each other.
It's a way a person's brain works.

3262
02:36:12,390 --> 02:36:14,830
Can't do that shit.
Yeah.

3263
02:36:16,580 --> 02:36:19,830
I tell you the reason why I thought you 
were dead last for sure.

3264
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:26,220
Did you really think you were cheap?
Let's pay people workouts.

3265
02:36:26,990 --> 02:36:29,140
For me,
I knew two things were going on.

3266
02:36:29,150 --> 02:36:29,983
One Tom had been exercising on a regular
basis and even though he might have 

3267
02:36:33,201 --> 02:36:34,034
carried a little bit of body fat,
he's actually a fit strong guy with a 

3268
02:36:36,411 --> 02:36:37,244
strong mind.
I also knew that Ra wept being one time 

3269
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:44,510
that motherfucker.
I was on top of him.

3270
02:36:44,511 --> 02:36:46,280
I was a brown belt.
He's a white belt.

3271
02:36:47,320 --> 02:36:49,820
Once in awhile.
My motherfucking back.

3272
02:36:49,821 --> 02:36:50,654
I was like,
oh,

3273
02:36:51,570 --> 02:36:52,403
I thought it was oprah.
She was mad at you guys where you're 

3274
02:36:53,751 --> 02:36:54,584
like,
we're going to vegas first cost center 

3275
02:36:55,140 --> 02:36:55,730
thing.
I was like,

3276
02:36:55,730 --> 02:36:57,470
I was almost going to be like,
just to ruin it for you.

3277
02:36:57,471 --> 02:36:57,891
I'm like,
okay,

3278
02:36:57,891 --> 02:36:59,480
cool.
I'll write a check.

3279
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:00,453
Tell me to write the check right now.
I'm assuming you're a fucking stupid 

3280
02:37:01,851 --> 02:37:04,490
thing.
Listen already tried to kill me with his

3281
02:37:04,491 --> 02:37:07,220
bare hands.
Who's trying to kill me?

3282
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:11,690
It was trying choked my neck.
Can I just say I know Ari now that we've

3283
02:37:11,691 --> 02:37:14,660
done this and to reward ourselves?
Yeah.

3284
02:37:15,230 --> 02:37:16,070
I say,
why

3285
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:20,240
don't we do something that would be fun.
I love this idea already and I know what

3286
02:37:20,241 --> 02:37:22,310
it is.
Surfing until someone dies.

3287
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:22,851
No,
I mean,

3288
02:37:22,851 --> 02:37:26,360
as we're going to vegas,
I had a boxing fight.

3289
02:37:26,361 --> 02:37:31,361
Would be fun watching any of you die.
Surfing would be the most fun.

3290
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:34,093
Decrease.
The level of happiness I have with my 

3291
02:37:35,541 --> 02:37:36,374
life.
Any sort of metrics show was Bert dying 

3292
02:37:44,040 --> 02:37:44,873
are you can't.
You can't deny that you are very proud 

3293
02:37:47,961 --> 02:37:48,794
of yourself for your,
your performance this month because in 

3294
02:37:51,111 --> 02:37:51,944
my opinion,
and this is I'm being 100 percent 

3295
02:37:53,511 --> 02:37:54,770
objective,
your,

3296
02:37:54,830 --> 02:37:59,830
your performance was the most impressive
exercise or not exercise.

3297
02:38:02,601 --> 02:38:06,680
I've been exercising my whole life when 
I saw you just all of a sudden.

3298
02:38:07,370 --> 02:38:08,480
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

3299
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:10,040
Nine point.
One day.

3300
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:11,360
Yeah.
I did a bunch,

3301
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:14,570
6:30
or something and I was like,

3302
02:38:14,571 --> 02:38:16,820
what the fuck?
When he caught right up and I was like,

3303
02:38:16,910 --> 02:38:17,720
oh fuck.

3304
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:19,880
I was ready to coast already.
Given up,

3305
02:38:19,940 --> 02:38:23,390
I saw a marathon one time where a guy 
went the wrong way.

3306
02:38:23,391 --> 02:38:24,224
He was in the elite,
are neck and neck with the guy went the 

3307
02:38:25,311 --> 02:38:26,580
wrong way.
Everyone had a sec.

3308
02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:26,841
No,
no,

3309
02:38:26,841 --> 02:38:27,021
no,
no,

3310
02:38:27,021 --> 02:38:29,690
you're going the wrong way.
This is the last like 300 meters.

3311
02:38:30,230 --> 02:38:31,430
And then he was like,
oh fuck,

3312
02:38:31,580 --> 02:38:32,780
maybe a mile,
you know?

3313
02:38:32,930 --> 02:38:35,570
And he had to come all the way back and 
they try to catch up,

3314
02:38:35,960 --> 02:38:36,793
but that wasted space that late and he 
started sprinting and he spits it right 

3315
02:38:40,131 --> 02:38:40,964
back to that other guy who was already 
in first place because he fucking dug 

3316
02:38:43,771 --> 02:38:44,900
down deep.
Yeah,

3317
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,080
I didn't want to die.
I was dreading to coast.

3318
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:49,100
And when you started winning I was like,
oh no,

3319
02:38:49,101 --> 02:38:51,410
I'm done.
And then I was like,

3320
02:38:51,411 --> 02:38:52,370
yeah,
I could do this.

3321
02:38:52,570 --> 02:38:54,010
Wow.
I'm pretty high too.

3322
02:38:54,340 --> 02:38:56,720
Yeah.
Can I just say though,

3323
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:59,930
instead of a boxing match,
which I find boring,

3324
02:38:59,931 --> 02:39:01,460
I'll be honest with you guys.
Where do you like,

3325
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:03,770
I get it white.
I understand where you come from.

3326
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:06,140
Okay.
What do you like to swing?

3327
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:10,190
Yes.
Kickboxer.

3328
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:13,490
Let's go see kickboxing.
Is that what you wanted to say?

3329
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:15,920
Yes.
That's what you were leaning towards.

3330
02:39:16,150 --> 02:39:19,190
Kick plus kickboxing.
Muay Thai.

3331
02:39:19,450 --> 02:39:21,110
We go to Chiang Mai,
Thailand,

3332
02:39:22,110 --> 02:39:23,250
Thailand?
Yes,

3333
02:39:23,580 --> 02:39:26,030
and we go see some kickboxing.
We can have cigars.

3334
02:39:26,031 --> 02:39:28,110
We can be an anonymity.
Oh,

3335
02:39:28,130 --> 02:39:30,010
we can just be regular people,
right?

3336
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:33,140
Go to go to a couple of kickboxing 
fights,

3337
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:36,030
walk around in sandals for a few days 
and band.

3338
02:39:36,070 --> 02:39:39,180
No time on Monday.
Went back on where.

3339
02:39:39,490 --> 02:39:43,160
What if I were a man?
I want to wear the uggs,

3340
02:39:43,161 --> 02:39:44,200
Bro.
I liked this.

3341
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:46,670
Some Thai food.
We stay out of Bangkok.

3342
02:39:46,671 --> 02:39:50,890
How long we stay in one of the fucking 
works are tying back in four or five.

3343
02:39:51,530 --> 02:39:53,680
I'm saying leave on a Monday.
We're back on a Friday.

3344
02:39:53,790 --> 02:39:54,623
You can go to your next.
You don't have to take off a Gig if you 

3345
02:39:56,151 --> 02:39:59,770
don't want to go see some fights.
Have cigars,

3346
02:39:59,771 --> 02:40:01,760
some change,
some Chang Beer.

3347
02:40:02,890 --> 02:40:03,723
Watch some fights.
I really do like get drunk walking 

3348
02:40:06,611 --> 02:40:09,040
around this,
so wait the.

3349
02:40:09,070 --> 02:40:09,903
But no.
I mean like have a good time after surf 

3350
02:40:11,901 --> 02:40:12,740
week.
No,

3351
02:40:12,780 --> 02:40:13,840
this is way before

3352
02:40:15,290 --> 02:40:19,320
rich kids planning for summer.
It's going to be a fucking surf.

3353
02:40:19,530 --> 02:40:20,460
Surf.
Travel.

3354
02:40:20,461 --> 02:40:21,990
What does that do you think you'll be 
good at it?

3355
02:40:22,070 --> 02:40:25,380
Surprising.
You really don't know.

3356
02:40:25,381 --> 02:40:28,680
I've ever done it.
So when I first started doing yoga,

3357
02:40:28,681 --> 02:40:33,010
I was amazed at how Shitty I was at it.
I was surprised it was it.

3358
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:36,050
I didn't think it would be good at it.
And that was worse than surfing.

3359
02:40:36,110 --> 02:40:36,810
No.
Yoga.

3360
02:40:36,810 --> 02:40:37,643
Yoga.
Oh yeah.

3361
02:40:38,290 --> 02:40:40,890
Clip for with a Nike.
What does it say?

3362
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:42,780
Our.
You're shifty.

3363
02:40:43,610 --> 02:40:44,443
I'll tell you something.
We haven't totally determined what the 

3364
02:40:47,881 --> 02:40:51,330
loser has to do or he wants us to like 
drink each other's piss

3365
02:40:51,860 --> 02:40:56,860
to drink your piss.
You might not lose right now.

3366
02:40:58,981 --> 02:41:01,800
Tom Seger is in the bottom at the 
bottom.

3367
02:41:01,950 --> 02:41:05,450
Tom Is gonna try.
I think he.

3368
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:08,160
I mean your obviously set to witness 
thing,

3369
02:41:08,161 --> 02:41:10,890
but I think Tom's going to sneak up.
He's playing it down.

3370
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:12,540
You looked at his wrist yesterday.
You Go,

3371
02:41:12,541 --> 02:41:14,280
what's that?
Thousand something.

3372
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:15,413
Oh,
that's nothing.

3373
02:41:15,750 --> 02:41:17,190
Just the calories.
You burned the day.

3374
02:41:17,191 --> 02:41:19,830
A thousand.
Tom's Tom Sneaky.

3375
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:21,433
A lot of people feel like that.
I really think he's gonna do something 

3376
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:26,010
on the.
He's going to be the one to to beat.

3377
02:41:26,130 --> 02:41:27,930
You got to realize though,
Bert ran a marathon.

3378
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:30,880
He did run a marathon.
This is a.

3379
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:32,980
This is fun.
I have to say.

3380
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:36,250
Any one of you could pull ahead,
but you're the.

3381
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:37,193
I mean,
can we talk about what you did 

3382
02:41:38,250 --> 02:41:39,083
yesterday?

3383
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:39,953
Yeah.
I worked out for three hours and 20 

3384
02:41:40,951 --> 02:41:41,784
minutes.
I'm trying to.

3385
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,030
I'm trying to.
Yeah,

3386
02:41:44,790 --> 02:41:47,880
I'm trying to break burt's will.
That's what I'm really trying to do.

3387
02:41:48,570 --> 02:41:50,400
Talks on this Mickey Mantle Gene.
Shit,

3388
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:52,310
mother fucker.
I'm crazy.

3389
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:55,250
I don't understand.
I will work out twice a day like that.

3390
02:41:55,610 --> 02:41:56,443
I will.
I will try to give you a fucking heart 

3391
02:41:57,231 --> 02:42:02,231
attack.
Well too.

3392
02:42:04,330 --> 02:42:08,210
He's going to know how long he's going 
to keep birds.

3393
02:42:08,260 --> 02:42:10,750
Very competitive.
Up to a point like the.

3394
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:15,730
With the weight loss challenge.
Tom Stayed steady and Tom one in the end

3395
02:42:15,870 --> 02:42:18,970
in one big bird tried.
He tried to sprint towards the end,

3396
02:42:19,370 --> 02:42:22,120
but it was too little too late and Tom 
was talking shit the entire time.

3397
02:42:22,121 --> 02:42:22,990
Like,
I know what you're gonna do.

3398
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:24,940
You're gonna fuck off until the very 
end.

3399
02:42:24,941 --> 02:42:27,190
Then you can try to catch up,
but it's going to be too late and he was

3400
02:42:27,191 --> 02:42:27,720
right.

3401
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:29,320
Yep.
Bert,

3402
02:42:30,570 --> 02:42:32,760
I don't know if birds will can be 
broken.

3403
02:42:32,761 --> 02:42:34,020
Has it been broken before?

3404
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:37,460
Well,
it's not as well.

3405
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:38,353
It's the discipline aspect.
When you're dealing with an entire 

3406
02:42:41,331 --> 02:42:42,164
month,
you have 31 days of having to get after 

3407
02:42:45,741 --> 02:42:46,574
it.
So how often do you get after it 

3408
02:42:47,691 --> 02:42:48,530
normally?
See,

3409
02:42:48,531 --> 02:42:49,364
that's the thing.
The difference between me and Bert is I 

3410
02:42:51,951 --> 02:42:52,784
work out almost every day already,
so for me it's just like those days off 

3411
02:42:56,661 --> 02:42:57,494
don't exist anymore,
so what I've decided to do on my days 

3412
02:42:59,361 --> 02:43:00,194
off,
it's just do shit that I wouldn't 

3413
02:43:00,681 --> 02:43:01,514
normally do,
so I'll do the elliptical machine for 

3414
02:43:03,471 --> 02:43:07,460
two hours or I'll do something else.
I'll do something else,

3415
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:10,220
but the whole time I'm thinking I'm 
going to break Bert.

3416
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,590
I'm to break.

3417
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:15,833
Think about when you're really trying to
get past that point where you're you 

3418
02:43:21,910 --> 02:43:22,743
kickboxing or even on an elliptical.
Sometimes you got to get angry and you 

3419
02:43:27,071 --> 02:43:30,560
think of bird.
Right now you're thinking about taking a

3420
02:43:30,780 --> 02:43:31,613
braking breaking as well.
I don't know if you guys are all in 

3421
02:43:36,721 --> 02:43:37,554
different ways and this is so 
interesting to watch because you're 

3422
02:43:40,451 --> 02:43:43,420
right,
you already work out a lot,

3423
02:43:43,421 --> 02:43:47,650
you're extremely healthy guy,
but you're now going to take it your ex.

3424
02:43:47,740 --> 02:43:48,573
I can see the excitement on all of you 
to take this to just an excruciating 

3425
02:43:52,391 --> 02:43:53,224
level and because it,
it gets obsessive and it gets fun like 

3426
02:43:55,990 --> 02:43:58,390
you can work,
but that's the thing I'm excited to talk

3427
02:43:58,391 --> 02:44:02,230
to you at the beginning of this when 
you're still pumped up about it and it's

3428
02:44:02,231 --> 02:44:04,900
like you get a high from working out for
three and a half hours a day,

3429
02:44:04,930 --> 02:44:06,970
17 days from now.
I'm going to be a beaten man.

3430
02:44:06,971 --> 02:44:07,804
Yeah,
you are,

3431
02:44:07,960 --> 02:44:11,020
and you're going to get a surge at the 
end when it gets close again,

3432
02:44:11,080 --> 02:44:12,460
but 17 days.
You're right.

3433
02:44:12,461 --> 02:44:13,990
That's not going to be a fun day for 
you.

3434
02:44:14,690 --> 02:44:15,670
Well,
I don't know.

3435
02:44:15,671 --> 02:44:16,504
Who knows?

3436
02:44:16,660 --> 02:44:19,090
Did you ever see.
There's a really interesting problem.

3437
02:44:20,100 --> 02:44:21,290
Yeah,
it's weird.

3438
02:44:21,620 --> 02:44:23,540
How do you feel?
How do you feel this hilarious,

3439
02:44:23,541 --> 02:44:25,540
man.
I'm her physically.

3440
02:44:25,580 --> 02:44:27,110
Would you feel.
Do you feel like you broke me?

3441
02:44:27,440 --> 02:44:28,480
No.
No.

3442
02:44:28,750 --> 02:44:30,610
Break,
did you feel your best?

3443
02:44:30,890 --> 02:44:32,840
You did your best when you talked to a 
lot of crazy shit.

3444
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:34,333
Shit.
Bird?

3445
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:37,090
No,
no,

3446
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:37,580
no,
no,

3447
02:44:37,580 --> 02:44:38,990
no.
It's good for everybody.

3448
02:44:40,850 --> 02:44:42,710
Dog Shit and those guys are doing.
I Talk Shit.

3449
02:44:42,740 --> 02:44:44,690
Listen,
I don't feel bad that you talk shit.

3450
02:44:44,750 --> 02:44:47,030
I'm happy to talk shit.
It was fun.

3451
02:44:47,300 --> 02:44:49,160
It was fun.
It's scary.

3452
02:44:49,161 --> 02:44:51,050
You should talk to your side.
Didn't,

3453
02:44:51,110 --> 02:44:51,943
but I didn't think that it would go 
where it went in terms of like my how 

3454
02:44:57,411 --> 02:44:58,244
much time everyday I was working out.
I never thought it would really get to 

3455
02:45:01,071 --> 02:45:01,920
that.
It was,

3456
02:45:02,510 --> 02:45:03,343
it was crazy.
I thought in the beginning we would all 

3457
02:45:05,061 --> 02:45:10,061
just have some fun workout an hour a day
and see whose number was higher.

3458
02:45:10,620 --> 02:45:12,260
Yeah.
It would be like real clothes.

3459
02:45:12,310 --> 02:45:12,620
No,
no,

3460
02:45:12,620 --> 02:45:13,011
no,
no.

3461
02:45:13,011 --> 02:45:13,844
I wanted it to everybody.
I figured Tommy that we talked about it 

3462
02:45:15,891 --> 02:45:18,260
with everybody.
The last week's gonna Sprint.

3463
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:19,373
Yeah,
right.

3464
02:45:19,550 --> 02:45:20,383
Yeah,
of course.

3465
02:45:20,420 --> 02:45:21,530
I thought that was definitely going to 
happen.

3466
02:45:21,770 --> 02:45:23,960
Then he made that video and I was like,
which video?

3467
02:45:23,961 --> 02:45:25,040
Which video?
I don't know.

3468
02:45:25,060 --> 02:45:26,540
When you said you a double major.
I was like,

3469
02:45:26,570 --> 02:45:28,710
I'm going to take those.
My dog.

3470
02:45:29,180 --> 02:45:32,190
No,
it was another one before that here,

3471
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:33,990
and he was like,
Woo.

3472
02:45:34,410 --> 02:45:37,370
I gotta come in last.
I was like,

3473
02:45:37,430 --> 02:45:38,890
oh wait,
hold on,

3474
02:45:38,891 --> 02:45:39,830
hold on.
You know,

3475
02:45:39,900 --> 02:45:42,350
you know for a fact that I made those 
videos I love.

3476
02:45:42,360 --> 02:45:43,670
Right.
I understand,

3477
02:45:43,940 --> 02:45:47,180
but I didn't listen.
I believe that right now,

3478
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:51,460
but it doesn't help me to believe that 
back then you don't understand.

3479
02:45:51,470 --> 02:45:54,290
You've got to say something like that.
Even if you don't mean it.

3480
02:45:54,500 --> 02:45:56,540
You said it and I don't have to get mad 
at you,

3481
02:45:56,810 --> 02:45:57,643
but I have to at least acknowledged 
there's a transference of energy right 

3482
02:46:01,611 --> 02:46:04,240
now.
I don't want to call it anger and says,

3483
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:06,830
we want to make sure that you don't ever
fucking win this thing.

3484
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:11,410
There's no way we're going to go down 
the dark road,

3485
02:46:13,660 --> 02:46:14,493
dark.

3486
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:18,530
This is the difference.
Let's not forget about that.

3487
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:21,110
This is the difference between high 
performers.

3488
02:46:21,470 --> 02:46:22,160
Wait,
hold on.

3489
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:24,710
Do you all.
Did you all recognize this?

3490
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:27,830
Because I picked up on it pretty 
quickly.

3491
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:32,660
Mickey Mantle Gene.
I knew we were done pretty quickly.

3492
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:33,990
You knew what I knew

3493
02:46:34,350 --> 02:46:36,150
done pretty quickly.
We were done.

3494
02:46:36,480 --> 02:46:37,313
I knew that when he was saying,
even though I understood 100 percent 

3495
02:46:42,331 --> 02:46:44,910
understood,
he was his joke that he's like,

3496
02:46:44,911 --> 02:46:46,800
whatever Joseph does,
I'm going to double up.

3497
02:46:48,050 --> 02:46:51,500
You probably knew that he would 
interpret that in a competitive way.

3498
02:46:53,080 --> 02:46:55,630
You should do your regular workout and 
see if he still paid us.

3499
02:46:55,631 --> 02:46:56,241
I'm like,
yeah,

3500
02:46:56,241 --> 02:46:57,050
yeah.
Hold on.

3501
02:46:57,050 --> 02:46:58,730
Not Negative,
but not negative.

3502
02:46:59,120 --> 02:47:02,300
Not not like what you don't like me.
I.

3503
02:47:02,810 --> 02:47:06,580
If you really say I'm going to double 
everything Joe Does,

3504
02:47:06,700 --> 02:47:07,533
Mike

3505
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:13,660
Joe's not going to let that.
I realized is that I get to take a knee.

3506
02:47:14,050 --> 02:47:16,080
I don't have to interpret it,
and you gave him the.

3507
02:47:16,081 --> 02:47:19,640
When you gave me a thought in my head 
that you're going to try to do that.

3508
02:47:21,190 --> 02:47:22,023
His daughter,
his daughter is not calling the cable 

3509
02:47:23,801 --> 02:47:26,560
Guy Daddy because he's been gone so long
working out.

3510
02:47:27,010 --> 02:47:29,800
She has no memory of him because you had
to say,

3511
02:47:29,801 --> 02:47:30,634
I'm going to double.
You don't need to know if you're being 

3512
02:47:34,990 --> 02:47:39,490
honest.
For me to know,

3513
02:47:39,550 --> 02:47:40,383
I pushed that aside.
I need to know that you think that 

3514
02:47:42,530 --> 02:47:47,350
you're going to do that.
You think really you,

3515
02:47:47,500 --> 02:47:48,333
even though you really know that he 
doesn't think he can do that 100 

3516
02:47:50,621 --> 02:47:51,670
percent,
but fuck him,

3517
02:47:51,671 --> 02:47:53,950
it can allow.
You can't allow that.

3518
02:47:53,951 --> 02:47:54,784
I'm going to put some blinders on.
Doesn't matter to take a chance and 

3519
02:47:59,870 --> 02:48:02,650
where they're going to.
We're going to go through the darkness.

3520
02:48:02,980 --> 02:48:03,813
Can I just say this,
that we all use burt as a motivation to 

3521
02:48:07,080 --> 02:48:11,920
beat,
but let's not get lost in this.

3522
02:48:11,990 --> 02:48:14,780
You got to understand,
I got real,

3523
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:16,033
real serious anxiety when you got sick 
and know when I realized I could move 

3524
02:48:21,621 --> 02:48:25,850
tuber when I realized I could recover.
That was like if I got worse,

3525
02:48:25,851 --> 02:48:27,110
I'd be like,
I'm super sick.

3526
02:48:27,111 --> 02:48:29,120
I wouldn't.
But when I realized I was getting better

3527
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:31,460
and I thought I might lose.
Yeah,

3528
02:48:31,510 --> 02:48:34,970
I got real anxiety about it.
Yeah.

3529
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:37,130
I got super nervous.
Yeah,

3530
02:48:37,220 --> 02:48:39,750
but you were the same as me.
Just don't call him Bert.

3531
02:48:40,860 --> 02:48:41,860
Bert.
Well,

3532
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:44,470
that'd be nice.
Last terrible.

3533
02:48:44,850 --> 02:48:47,360
What kills me is that what you eat,
you,

3534
02:48:47,400 --> 02:48:52,400
you put a video out was what it was.
What was it or was it a twitter post?

3535
02:48:53,240 --> 02:48:54,530
Early?
It was like,

3536
02:48:54,950 --> 02:48:56,960
where do I put the built?
Yeah,

3537
02:48:57,340 --> 02:48:58,173
of course.

3538
02:48:59,740 --> 02:49:01,460
I want to just be very,
very clear,

3539
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:02,433
very clear.
I did not enter into this contest to 

3540
02:49:04,591 --> 02:49:06,520
lose.
I didn't think I was coming in.

3541
02:49:07,030 --> 02:49:07,863
They fuck up.

3542
02:49:08,670 --> 02:49:11,140
What was that?
Now before,

3543
02:49:11,141 --> 02:49:14,160
I don't know.
And we also have a fitness aspect.

3544
02:49:14,220 --> 02:49:15,053
That's right.
I'm challenging those gentlemen in 

3545
02:49:16,981 --> 02:49:18,810
fitness and I'm going to beat them at 
their own game.

3546
02:49:18,811 --> 02:49:21,570
And you're a good host.
We're getting a brand new porsche.

3547
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:24,670
What do we got here?
We've got a 1992.

3548
02:49:27,690 --> 02:49:31,230
Which one are you?
The guy that doesn't have any clothes on

3549
02:49:31,610 --> 02:49:36,090
flops and shit.
I'll take it over.

3550
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:37,170
Everybody.
Permission to.

3551
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:42,780
How much was it hit me up and was like,
congrats.

3552
02:49:42,810 --> 02:49:46,290
That's a dope car for 24.
20.

3553
02:49:46,620 --> 02:49:47,680
Yeah.
He talked a lot.

3554
02:49:48,080 --> 02:49:49,170
I did talk shit though,
Bro.

3555
02:49:49,171 --> 02:49:49,820
Hey,
hold on,

3556
02:49:49,820 --> 02:49:52,560
hold on for real talk.
He talks too much shipper.

3557
02:49:52,610 --> 02:49:54,720
No,
I won't stop and never ever,

3558
02:49:54,721 --> 02:49:58,110
ever much one guy and one guy.
I don't want you to.

3559
02:49:58,770 --> 02:50:00,470
I want you to be.
So yeah,

3560
02:50:01,960 --> 02:50:03,630
it was fun.
It was fun.

3561
02:50:03,631 --> 02:50:05,310
Let me tell you something I'm missing 
though,

3562
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:09,120
is that all of us went to try to make 
sure you don't beat them,

3563
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:14,070
but you lost.

3564
02:50:14,410 --> 02:50:16,590
Yeah.
But I lost on purpose.

3565
02:50:16,650 --> 02:50:19,560
What's that going to Joey see you at the
store that one day.

3566
02:50:19,561 --> 02:50:20,630
Did you hear about this?
What happened?

3567
02:50:20,800 --> 02:50:22,650
Joey was here on the podcast.
He called me.

3568
02:50:22,700 --> 02:50:24,300
Yeah.
Was that you know,

3569
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:25,500
no dog.
No.

3570
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:29,760
He called me and said I did a video on 
instagram stories.

3571
02:50:29,850 --> 02:50:30,683
I got recognized.
I didn't know person there were like 

3572
02:50:32,161 --> 02:50:32,994
Bert and tried to tell me story.
Joe Is taught and then said that he 

3573
02:50:35,611 --> 02:50:39,510
caught me drinking in a parking lot.
But if you saw the stories,

3574
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:40,890
you'd know.
I wasn't drunk.

3575
02:50:40,891 --> 02:50:42,240
I was stone sober.
But yeah,

3576
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:44,040
he called me and told me.
He's like,

3577
02:50:44,041 --> 02:50:45,330
I see you're tricking dog.

3578
02:50:48,050 --> 02:50:51,670
What I love about Joey Diaz,
he called and apologized because I guess

3579
02:50:51,940 --> 02:50:54,430
I didn't notice it,
but it got some big online,

3580
02:50:54,700 --> 02:50:56,760
something on my podcast,
but it was clearly.

3581
02:50:56,761 --> 02:50:58,890
Jochen knows.
He's like,

3582
02:50:58,891 --> 02:51:01,650
I don't know about Bert Kreischer 
because I saw him walking in the street.

3583
02:51:01,651 --> 02:51:03,510
I waved at him.
He didn't wave back.

3584
02:51:03,570 --> 02:51:04,403
All I heard.
I heard that 80 percent tongue in cheek 

3585
02:51:07,370 --> 02:51:10,410
joke called Joey.
Now trust me on my children.

3586
02:51:10,480 --> 02:51:12,420
I would never lie to you about any one 
thing.

3587
02:51:12,430 --> 02:51:15,360
I did listen the last day when I hit you
up and I was like,

3588
02:51:15,361 --> 02:51:17,490
I'm out.
I swear on my children,

3589
02:51:17,910 --> 02:51:18,743
dude friends.
No one thinks you lied and here's the 

3590
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:25,290
blame me what you believe in.
What?

3591
02:51:25,410 --> 02:51:28,730
I believed him and there was still a 
part of my brain that was like,

3592
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:30,090
make sure just.
Yeah,

3593
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:32,800
I would never do that.
I probably tell you it was back then.

3594
02:51:33,800 --> 02:51:34,633
It was a separate thought though.
It wasn't that I didn't think you were 

3595
02:51:38,431 --> 02:51:40,050
lying,
but I still was like,

3596
02:51:40,051 --> 02:51:40,884
my brain would not allow me to just.
I know you didn't want her motel mode 

3597
02:51:44,680 --> 02:51:46,770
and you get an extra workout.
I watched,

3598
02:51:47,100 --> 02:51:47,933
I saw and I went,
I can't believe he didn't believe I 

3599
02:51:49,771 --> 02:51:51,360
believed you.
I believed you.

3600
02:51:51,361 --> 02:51:52,194
I was just like,
you can't be so stupid to believe in 

3601
02:51:56,221 --> 02:51:58,080
fully.
It kind of,

3602
02:51:58,100 --> 02:51:58,800
yeah.
I was like,

3603
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:01,890
what if,
what if it wasn't that he was lying?

3604
02:52:01,891 --> 02:52:04,950
He sat now he sounded so sincere.
Ecological Games.

3605
02:52:05,090 --> 02:52:05,923
Those games.
Yeah.

3606
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:07,690
I like what Joe was like,
wait,

3607
02:52:07,780 --> 02:52:08,613
are you just saving up your points and 
not registering into the system so that 

3608
02:52:11,401 --> 02:52:13,270
you can like sand bags?
Yes.

3609
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:15,670
You fucking idiot.
What'd you think I was doing?

3610
02:52:17,020 --> 02:52:20,980
Of course I didn't know.
I didn't know what to think when I spoke

3611
02:52:20,981 --> 02:52:23,260
to you.
I still believe Georgia

3612
02:52:23,350 --> 02:52:25,380
called that morning.
There's two.

3613
02:52:26,250 --> 02:52:28,380
I would never know it.
I will never make an excuse.

3614
02:52:28,880 --> 02:52:32,340
Georgia called that morning and I just 
kind of spin class and I was going for a

3615
02:52:32,341 --> 02:52:35,040
12 mile run in my head.
I was like,

3616
02:52:35,100 --> 02:52:36,540
I'm set.
I'm putting clothes on.

3617
02:52:36,541 --> 02:52:38,210
And Georgia texted and said,
uh,

3618
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:42,750
daddy daughter luncheon at Lou or 
wherever she goes to school.

3619
02:52:43,180 --> 02:52:48,180
She was telling a kid dollar lunch in it
like 11 and you need to be there at nine

3620
02:52:48,541 --> 02:52:49,830
to help set up.
And I was like,

3621
02:52:50,310 --> 02:52:52,200
fuck.
And in my head I just,

3622
02:52:52,260 --> 02:52:55,020
all I did was wantonly wanted res life,

3623
02:52:55,320 --> 02:52:56,153
right?
He didn't have any responsibilities and 

3624
02:52:57,510 --> 02:52:59,040
I just was like,
I was like,

3625
02:52:59,430 --> 02:53:00,140
I texted him,

3626
02:53:00,140 --> 02:53:02,210
everyone that at that moment I was like,
I'm out.

3627
02:53:02,610 --> 02:53:03,443
I'm.
I got softball practice and a luncheon 

3628
02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:07,730
and I,
dude,

3629
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:09,860
in that middle of that luncheon,
I was like,

3630
02:53:09,950 --> 02:53:11,330
I could go for a run right now.

3631
02:53:11,390 --> 02:53:14,720
Like in my head that this whole thing 
was psychotic.

3632
02:53:15,170 --> 02:53:16,720
Made me psychotic.
Honestly,

3633
02:53:16,730 --> 02:53:18,660
I got to the point where I thought about
your lives.

3634
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:19,513
I was like,
wait a minute.

3635
02:53:19,580 --> 02:53:20,413
I do have more fun at night usually,
but like daytime I have no 

3636
02:53:23,841 --> 02:53:24,674
responsibility and this is a lot of 
effort for me to get to this place and 

3637
02:53:27,681 --> 02:53:28,680
do this time.
Yeah.

3638
02:53:28,850 --> 02:53:32,770
I don't know what you guys go through in
order to feel like this.

3639
02:53:32,780 --> 02:53:36,830
Take time away to do your life is very 
different.

3640
02:53:36,980 --> 02:53:38,760
We kids are at school because your 
school.

3641
02:53:38,770 --> 02:53:39,680
Okay,
that makes sense.

3642
02:53:39,681 --> 02:53:42,620
So you have this open amount of time 
from 7:00

3643
02:53:42,620 --> 02:53:44,960
AM to 4:00
PM or whatever it is.

3644
02:53:44,961 --> 02:53:45,794
After that,
if it's an unusual guest and I just 

3645
02:53:48,201 --> 02:53:50,430
scheduled everything in there,
that's a lot of time,

3646
02:53:50,431 --> 02:53:51,264
man.
I have that time to this thing has been 

3647
02:53:54,440 --> 02:53:55,273
7:00
AM.

3648
02:53:55,850 --> 02:53:56,920
11 words,
man.

3649
02:53:56,921 --> 02:54:00,200
That's.
You have a gym in your compound like you

3650
02:54:00,201 --> 02:54:01,730
can do it.
I was jealous,

3651
02:54:01,731 --> 02:54:02,564
like Jordan's Jim in his porsche,
little treadmill and I can get here and 

3652
02:54:08,001 --> 02:54:11,750
get an hour in before podcasts.
Now you did it right man,

3653
02:54:11,960 --> 02:54:15,020
but I never thought of it that I can 
build this thing so I could win.

3654
02:54:17,410 --> 02:54:19,010
How fucking.
Let's be honest here.

3655
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:20,660
Just to entertain this thought for a 
second.

3656
02:54:20,900 --> 02:54:23,270
How much of a piece of shit?
What'd you feel like

3657
02:54:23,410 --> 02:54:28,410
it right now in the second telling you,
how upset would you say

3658
02:54:34,210 --> 02:54:36,410
worried about Ari?
I was worried.

3659
02:54:37,750 --> 02:54:38,583
I was worried about.

3660
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:43,200
Yeah,
because even like the 30th

3661
02:54:43,320 --> 02:54:47,460
in the 30th when I know that the very 
last day when he had a picture said,

3662
02:54:47,461 --> 02:54:50,290
do you believe in miracles like this 
motherfucker's store and point?

3663
02:54:53,450 --> 02:54:55,020
Yeah.
The

3664
02:54:55,030 --> 02:55:00,030
way you believe America is just the last
three point where you say about this,

3665
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:01,350
right?
A little bit.

3666
02:55:01,430 --> 02:55:02,460
Well,
I would laugh.

3667
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:04,250
You would have to be humble because

3668
02:55:04,250 --> 02:55:06,680
here's the deal.
At the end of the beat,

3669
02:55:06,681 --> 02:55:09,950
me,
I almost killed myself,

3670
02:55:10,730 --> 02:55:12,860
so if you beat me,
what did you go through?

3671
02:55:14,520 --> 02:55:15,810
All of us.
Your.

3672
02:55:16,190 --> 02:55:20,090
What was your,
what was your final scores for 11,000,

3673
02:55:20,110 --> 02:55:21,580
11,000
something.

3674
02:55:21,750 --> 02:55:22,583
It's they're crazy too.
They let us know that you finished 

3675
02:55:24,710 --> 02:55:25,543
324th,
I think 324th in the country in the 

3676
02:55:28,480 --> 02:55:29,313
world and the world of registered users.
Three hundred and 23 other people 

3677
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:35,420
crushed him or,
or just be.

3678
02:55:35,480 --> 02:55:36,313
I mean,
you know,

3679
02:55:36,410 --> 02:55:39,680
there's one that definitely fucking 
muscle somebody.

3680
02:55:39,710 --> 02:55:42,580
How do you know?
Like $19,000?

3681
02:55:42,581 --> 02:55:43,414
They wouldn't tell me,
but they would tell a lot the 

3682
02:55:46,341 --> 02:55:47,174
milestones.
Guys said that a lot of these people or 

3683
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:51,410
fitness instructors that are doing five,
six,

3684
02:55:51,411 --> 02:55:56,411
even seven classes a day,
people out there that are in the shape.

3685
02:55:58,500 --> 02:56:00,860
That's amazing.
That is amazing.

3686
02:56:00,861 --> 02:56:05,300
Imagine teaching six spin classes a 
fucking.

3687
02:56:05,970 --> 02:56:06,803
They don't do that.

3688
02:56:06,830 --> 02:56:09,390
Don't do that though.
Not even the regular person does that,

3689
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:12,860
but could they do it?
It could decided to go from gym to gym.

3690
02:56:13,820 --> 02:56:16,000
Maybe they'd have to.
I don't know if they would stop them.

3691
02:56:16,100 --> 02:56:17,510
Who would say,
is there a like a,

3692
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:18,523
you know,
at least to have that thing with 

3693
02:56:18,830 --> 02:56:23,660
Oxycontin's in Florida where you can get
a subscription or a prescription for one

3694
02:56:23,661 --> 02:56:25,870
guy,
they go down and another guy.

3695
02:56:25,960 --> 02:56:29,950
Then they developed database.
They have a database on that.

3696
02:56:29,990 --> 02:56:34,990
On spec life is spending too much.
Yeah.

3697
02:56:35,191 --> 02:56:36,024
These people are spinning their ass off.
Were the chest strap and teach 100 

3698
02:56:39,471 --> 02:56:42,320
fucking spin classes a day.
Should we do one more cocktail?

3699
02:56:43,170 --> 02:56:46,970
Are we going to eat or drink after this?
I'm fucking bombed.

3700
02:56:47,150 --> 02:56:50,630
I liked it with a six slash 20.
We're good.

3701
02:56:51,350 --> 02:56:54,420
We're fine.
We're good to go to dinner.

3702
02:56:54,840 --> 02:56:58,620
Food plans and a son.

3703
02:56:59,140 --> 02:57:00,370
Um,
wait.

3704
02:57:00,470 --> 02:57:04,880
Let's just all acknowledge I cannot 
drink for a month,

3705
02:57:05,580 --> 02:57:06,620
right?
What do you mean?

3706
02:57:07,070 --> 02:57:07,903
When we started this whole thing,
everyone thought I couldn't do it 

3707
02:57:09,680 --> 02:57:10,513
because I've been thinking.
What do you think will happen to you on 

3708
02:57:15,441 --> 02:57:16,820
your tour next year?
Do you think you'll go?

3709
02:57:16,821 --> 02:57:17,654
Well,
I'm saying as far as your late night 

3710
02:57:20,301 --> 02:57:21,470
stuff,
I don't know.

3711
02:57:21,930 --> 02:57:23,070
Yeah,
if you have a button for me,

3712
02:57:23,190 --> 02:57:26,540
so maybe you will not drink that much.
Drinking changed,

3713
02:57:26,570 --> 02:57:30,080
a lot of it's been three days or 
whatever,

3714
02:57:30,081 --> 02:57:34,760
but like just in the things that would 
trigger me of like I'm in an airport,

3715
02:57:34,761 --> 02:57:35,980
I have a cocktail.
Yeah,

3716
02:57:36,080 --> 02:57:38,810
I can totally fly sober.
Um,

3717
02:57:39,020 --> 02:57:40,430
I don't know man.
I really don't know.

3718
02:57:40,431 --> 02:57:42,110
You know me,
I'll be really honest.

3719
02:57:42,730 --> 02:57:43,563
Listen,
you clearly can take a month off that 

3720
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:49,010
can do it.
And you know,

3721
02:57:49,011 --> 02:57:49,844
one of the things that I,
I've been really wrestling with a lot 

3722
02:57:51,861 --> 02:57:54,530
lately.
I had this Guy Tyson fury.

3723
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:55,393
Do you know who he is?
He used to be the heavyweight boxing 

3724
02:57:58,101 --> 02:58:02,040
champion of the world and fly to fight 
the bronze

3725
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:02,641
bomber,
right?

3726
02:58:02,641 --> 02:58:03,900
Yes.
It's about to fight.

3727
02:58:03,901 --> 02:58:06,210
Deontay wilder and I had him on the 
podcast.

3728
02:58:06,211 --> 02:58:07,044
He was talking about depression and all 
the shit that he went through and one 

3729
02:58:09,391 --> 02:58:10,224
things that he said is that what pulled 
him out of it was deontay wilder said 

3730
02:58:12,931 --> 02:58:13,764
that he was finished and he decided he 
was going to figure out a way to get 

3731
02:58:16,621 --> 02:58:17,454
back.
So he decided to just get his fucking 

3732
02:58:19,411 --> 02:58:20,244
shit together and start competition.
Competition won the world heavyweight 

3733
02:58:25,231 --> 02:58:28,410
title beat Vladimir Klitschko.
And then went into a depression.

3734
02:58:28,411 --> 02:58:29,340
It's like,
what now?

3735
02:58:29,430 --> 02:58:32,100
Just didn't know what the fuck to do.
I just felt weird.

3736
02:58:32,520 --> 02:58:35,220
This guy called them out years and years
later,

3737
02:58:35,221 --> 02:58:38,190
drank in carrying on Kenton fucking 
crazy.

3738
02:58:38,520 --> 02:58:40,380
And then this guy says he can never come
back.

3739
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:41,910
It was like,
Oh really?

3740
02:58:42,230 --> 02:58:44,220
And then all of a sudden he decided to 
come back,

3741
02:58:44,280 --> 02:58:45,113
approved this coverall and now he's off 
medication wasn't even on any 

3742
02:58:49,261 --> 02:58:50,040
medication.

3743
02:58:50,040 --> 02:58:52,940
They were trying to give them some shit 
and fuck right is enticing.

3744
02:58:52,960 --> 02:58:53,461
Six,
six,

3745
02:58:53,461 --> 02:58:54,294
nine,
six.

3746
02:58:54,690 --> 02:58:55,523
Gigantic guy.
But he said he's going to do it with 

3747
02:58:58,050 --> 02:59:01,070
goal setting.
He's an he hadn't,

3748
02:59:01,150 --> 02:59:06,150
he seemed happy and friendly and he lost
like a shit ton of weight.

3749
02:59:06,970 --> 02:59:11,010
I lost like a hundred.
What's the like 150 pounds or something?

3750
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:13,620
Wasn't it something crazy,
Jamie?

3751
02:59:13,621 --> 02:59:15,540
Do you remember?
Spuds a big motivator.

3752
02:59:16,300 --> 02:59:18,630
It's a little bit of that,
but it's also goal setting.

3753
02:59:19,050 --> 02:59:19,530
Setting.
Yeah.

3754
02:59:19,530 --> 02:59:22,350
So the thing that he said that made me 
think about this month,

3755
02:59:22,680 --> 02:59:23,880
this month,
it was weird.

3756
02:59:24,270 --> 02:59:25,290
When it was over,
I was like,

3757
02:59:25,320 --> 02:59:28,700
what the fuck happened?
He was trying to tell you,

3758
02:59:28,701 --> 02:59:31,110
man,
that day that I ran the 12 miles,

3759
02:59:31,220 --> 02:59:33,780
kind of 91 point 631 points and yet,
yeah,

3760
02:59:33,850 --> 02:59:34,683
forget what you got that it was like,
I really was like a backbreaker it was 

3761
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:39,260
it back there.
I was like,

3762
02:59:39,270 --> 02:59:40,800
I might be done.
That was a Sunday.

3763
02:59:40,801 --> 02:59:41,634
I got back in town.
Site was about you got to get even with 

3764
02:59:44,701 --> 02:59:45,331
me,
but I was like,

3765
02:59:45,331 --> 02:59:50,331
I might be done versus what he looks 
like now and then 135 pounds.

3766
02:59:55,570 --> 02:59:57,960
He was a great interview man.
When he talks,

3767
02:59:58,020 --> 03:00:01,470
he's a great guy.
I'm always saying just that I fucking,

3768
03:00:01,560 --> 03:00:03,420
I,
I thought I.

3769
03:00:03,421 --> 03:00:03,790
The whole time

3770
03:00:03,790 --> 03:00:06,160
time I would see.
I would look down,

3771
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:10,180
see how far I ran and it'd be like 400 
points.

3772
03:00:10,420 --> 03:00:13,060
It's not enough points.
Just keep running man.

3773
03:00:13,210 --> 03:00:14,310
Just keep running,
keep running.

3774
03:00:15,120 --> 03:00:15,760
Yeah.
Yes.

3775
03:00:15,760 --> 03:00:16,880
It's spite,
spite.

3776
03:00:16,940 --> 03:00:17,773
It was the fear of loss.
I wish everyone had poked at Joe a tad 

3777
03:00:21,091 --> 03:00:25,650
bit because to feel,
to feel wrong.

3778
03:00:25,700 --> 03:00:27,060
Play No.
Why not?

3779
03:00:27,930 --> 03:00:28,763
Why?
Because we had a chance to beat him if 

3780
03:00:29,911 --> 03:00:31,310
he just did like.
No,

3781
03:00:31,320 --> 03:00:31,591
no,
no,

3782
03:00:31,591 --> 03:00:31,951
no,
no.

3783
03:00:31,951 --> 03:00:36,530
Let him add.
Why do you play a game with Joe and feel

3784
03:00:36,560 --> 03:00:41,550
as the game is to win?
You don't always,

3785
03:00:41,990 --> 03:00:43,350
dude,
I looked at,

3786
03:00:43,351 --> 03:00:46,470
is it a win win situation?
Right?

3787
03:00:46,690 --> 03:00:49,860
He's too smart.
Every word that comes out of his mouth,

3788
03:00:49,861 --> 03:00:50,694
I have to analyze.
There's not a part of you that wants to 

3789
03:00:52,141 --> 03:00:54,120
just like,
it's too slippery.

3790
03:00:55,020 --> 03:00:56,200
Starts talking to me.
Hey.

3791
03:00:56,210 --> 03:00:58,560
She just tried to like lift weights and 
see what your score is.

3792
03:00:58,740 --> 03:00:59,573
Exactly.
The

3793
03:01:00,150 --> 03:01:04,980
score in his head.
It's like,

3794
03:01:05,170 --> 03:01:08,710
Oh really?
Oh No,

3795
03:01:08,880 --> 03:01:13,880
you want to win?
Try real hard.

3796
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:16,553
Didn't I decided I was going to take you
on some thousand point desks were empty 

3797
03:01:20,441 --> 03:01:20,950
here,
Bro.

3798
03:01:20,950 --> 03:01:22,480
Wait,
are we done with punch?

3799
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:23,350
I know.
Try this.

3800
03:01:23,350 --> 03:01:24,760
Try this.
Try this.

3801
03:01:24,770 --> 03:01:25,603
Blanton's wouldn't we?
As everyone is fucked up as I'm pretty 

3802
03:01:27,611 --> 03:01:28,210
fucked up.
Yeah,

3803
03:01:28,210 --> 03:01:30,650
we're pretty.
We're going to eat right?

3804
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:37,480
Right.
Do you know who was who asked?

3805
03:01:45,310 --> 03:01:46,280
Bird bird.
Bird.

3806
03:01:46,330 --> 03:01:47,163
Yes.
I did.

3807
03:01:47,650 --> 03:01:48,820
Also,
by the way,

3808
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:50,133
for this podcast this year,
Tom pointed out how to push those 

3809
03:01:53,081 --> 03:01:54,550
$10,000,
so it was kids.

3810
03:02:01,790 --> 03:02:03,580
Let's set it up correctly.
What happened?

3811
03:02:03,640 --> 03:02:04,560
Please?
Let's have it.

3812
03:02:04,780 --> 03:02:05,613
What happened was this I,
you and I were joking about a marathon 

3813
03:02:10,130 --> 03:02:12,660
and whatever.
Yes.

3814
03:02:13,440 --> 03:02:14,273
And then I booked.
You mentioned nothing of this ever 

3815
03:02:17,181 --> 03:02:18,350
again.
A joking.

3816
03:02:18,440 --> 03:02:19,390
Yes.
Okay.

3817
03:02:19,970 --> 03:02:23,480
Then I booked a movie in Australia 
again.

3818
03:02:24,830 --> 03:02:27,980
I went to,
I went to Atlanta to shoot the movie.

3819
03:02:28,400 --> 03:02:33,400
He doesn't care about them,
care about them.

3820
03:02:37,100 --> 03:02:40,190
First class tickets.
I was like,

3821
03:02:40,220 --> 03:02:45,220
I'm not interested twice in a row.
I love Australia.

3822
03:02:48,080 --> 03:02:51,920
I've been fucking kill yourself.

3823
03:02:52,170 --> 03:02:55,330
I don't know.
I,

3824
03:02:56,490 --> 03:02:57,820
I can't.
I went,

3825
03:02:57,840 --> 03:03:02,840
I went to shoot the movie while I'm in 
Atlanta shooting this movie.

3826
03:03:05,210 --> 03:03:08,090
This fucking guy's like,
I'm at the starting line.

3827
03:03:08,091 --> 03:03:09,970
Whereas Tom,
he knows where I'm fucking.

3828
03:03:10,400 --> 03:03:12,320
He's like,
you're in Atlanta.

3829
03:03:12,620 --> 03:03:14,250
You're in Atlanta.
Changed the rules.

3830
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:15,950
He's at Tom Hayes.

3831
03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:18,330
Oh,
he's tweeting a no show.

3832
03:03:18,331 --> 03:03:19,164
He's supposed to be here.
Did know the night before I posted a 

3833
03:03:24,561 --> 03:03:25,500
video and say,
hey guys,

3834
03:03:25,501 --> 03:03:26,910
I'm sorry.
Tommy is not going to.

3835
03:03:29,170 --> 03:03:34,170
Government tend to do youth through me.
That's fake news.

3836
03:03:39,330 --> 03:03:42,030
So here's the,
here's what happened.

3837
03:03:42,210 --> 03:03:44,940
Yeah.
I call burden like I'm getting a fucking

3838
03:03:44,970 --> 03:03:48,900
lot of messages and it's all people that
are like,

3839
03:03:48,901 --> 03:03:51,160
you're quitting.
You're welding on this bed.

3840
03:03:52,070 --> 03:03:54,310
You mother fucker starts to become the 
most yet.

3841
03:03:54,730 --> 03:03:55,710
He goes.
He goes,

3842
03:03:55,711 --> 03:03:56,544
yeah,
yeah.

3843
03:03:56,670 --> 03:03:58,130
I'm just around.
He goes,

3844
03:03:58,310 --> 03:03:59,510
hey,
to make it up to you,

3845
03:03:59,870 --> 03:04:02,480
if I finished this thing,
I'll donate $10,000.

3846
03:04:06,320 --> 03:04:07,990
I've never said that my entire life.
Joe.

3847
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:08,840
He never,
um,

3848
03:04:08,841 --> 03:04:11,390
never said this in my entire life where 
you heard him say that though.

3849
03:04:11,630 --> 03:04:12,463
When he goes,
he goes and he goes and he cited his 

3850
03:04:18,501 --> 03:04:19,161
father.
He goes,

3851
03:04:19,161 --> 03:04:23,030
if I don't beat father time,
I'll donate 20,000.

3852
03:04:23,420 --> 03:04:24,253
By the way,
my father just ran the marine corps 

3853
03:04:25,071 --> 03:04:26,990
marathon.
He did last Sunday.

3854
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,100
I went 81 years old.
Eighty one.

3855
03:04:29,390 --> 03:04:30,223
Mr.
Fear.

3856
03:04:30,330 --> 03:04:31,830
Yes.
Great.

3857
03:04:32,380 --> 03:04:33,530
Yes sir.
I never said that.

3858
03:04:33,590 --> 03:04:34,330
I never said that.
Okay.

3859
03:04:34,330 --> 03:04:37,760
So he said that he bailed on those kids.

3860
03:04:38,230 --> 03:04:40,760
Kids finished the marathon.
You have to celebrate.

3861
03:04:40,761 --> 03:04:45,761
You took it upon yourself to get the 
money pledged that,

3862
03:04:47,410 --> 03:04:48,243
that bird pledge to those sick kids.
You started fat Bert when six children 

3863
03:04:52,760 --> 03:04:57,760
died and you were able to $11,270
for children's Hospital of Los Angeles,

3864
03:05:01,670 --> 03:05:03,350
La Children's hospital,
Los Angeles.

3865
03:05:03,390 --> 03:05:04,223
Uh,
the gofundme [inaudible] dot com slash 

3866
03:05:05,180 --> 03:05:06,013
evil burt was very successful.
And during this month we filled it out 

3867
03:05:11,030 --> 03:05:13,190
and I was able to,
because you call it to my attention,

3868
03:05:13,191 --> 03:05:15,530
Thomas,
because you called it an injustice to my

3869
03:05:15,531 --> 03:05:16,364
attention.
A lot of the kids died waiting for 

3870
03:05:17,541 --> 03:05:18,374
those,
for births.

3871
03:05:20,170 --> 03:05:21,560
They actually,
at the,

3872
03:05:21,561 --> 03:05:22,830
uh,
cemetery there,

3873
03:05:23,150 --> 03:05:27,990
they have a Bert kids plus kids that 
died under the time.

3874
03:05:28,820 --> 03:05:29,653
Wow.
It's amazing the money for these kids 

3875
03:05:38,580 --> 03:05:41,670
know that this is real or it's.
My mom said,

3876
03:05:41,930 --> 03:05:43,460
my mom asked me about it.
I was like,

3877
03:05:43,461 --> 03:05:44,300
yeah.
And she goes,

3878
03:05:44,330 --> 03:05:46,160
can you tell Bert that he sucks?

3879
03:05:46,160 --> 03:05:48,140
My Orthodox Jewish moms say that 
forensic,

3880
03:05:48,360 --> 03:05:49,910
he sucks.
I was like,

3881
03:05:49,911 --> 03:05:50,481
mom,
no.

3882
03:05:50,481 --> 03:05:51,950
It's not like where you think goes.
Hey,

3883
03:05:52,040 --> 03:05:54,890
tell him I think he's put a hole in the 
sheet.

3884
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:57,020
How many times did your pops done this 
thing he's done?

3885
03:05:57,380 --> 03:06:00,000
He said he thinks without really 
thinking hard.

3886
03:06:00,001 --> 03:06:02,860
10 marathons.
Three seven Marine Corps.

3887
03:06:02,930 --> 03:06:03,840
Oh Wow.
Good for her.

3888
03:06:03,860 --> 03:06:04,693
Last one was the 81.
First one was like $60 to run it with 

3889
03:06:06,471 --> 03:06:07,700
him.
No,

3890
03:06:07,701 --> 03:06:09,020
but he worked.
By the way,

3891
03:06:09,150 --> 03:06:09,983
when,
when you mentioned that I was looking 

3892
03:06:11,211 --> 03:06:12,530
at.
I was looking at the numbers,

3893
03:06:12,531 --> 03:06:13,190
I was like,
oh,

3894
03:06:13,190 --> 03:06:15,860
these are about to jump on.
He just ran a marathon with his dad.

3895
03:06:16,010 --> 03:06:17,780
That's what I thought I really did.
I was like,

3896
03:06:17,781 --> 03:06:18,614
he just did and I was looking at that 
screen like this is about to jump to 

3897
03:06:21,261 --> 03:06:22,530
like,
like 19,000.

3898
03:06:22,760 --> 03:06:25,870
I thought it was going to be and my dad 
teamed up for the free,

3899
03:06:26,210 --> 03:06:28,760
like miles said about his dad and I was 
like,

3900
03:06:29,300 --> 03:06:30,260
your dad did it.

3901
03:06:30,620 --> 03:06:31,620
Did you do it?
I,

3902
03:06:31,670 --> 03:06:32,510
I,
and I.

3903
03:06:32,510 --> 03:06:37,190
It took me an hour to believe that you 
didn't do it at any point.

3904
03:06:37,340 --> 03:06:39,300
Wonder whether or not your body was 
gonna.

3905
03:06:39,320 --> 03:06:42,220
Hold up,
hold up.

3906
03:06:42,230 --> 03:06:43,970
I could do like 30 minutes.
And I was like,

3907
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:45,140
I got to slow down.
I can't.

3908
03:06:45,141 --> 03:06:50,141
I never felt as weak as the last day at 
night I spoke,

3909
03:06:50,420 --> 03:06:53,360
I actually had spoken to you.
I've spoken to you and the last person I

3910
03:06:53,361 --> 03:06:56,430
spoke to was Ari and he,
if you're going to do it,

3911
03:06:56,490 --> 03:06:59,040
will you just sync up so I'll know where
you're at.

3912
03:06:59,041 --> 03:06:59,874
And I was like,
yeah,

3913
03:07:00,030 --> 03:07:02,610
and then I go,
I'm not doing 700 right now.

3914
03:07:02,611 --> 03:07:04,220
That's how much I space.
Mine flew.

3915
03:07:04,230 --> 03:07:04,951
By the way,
I didn't tell you.

3916
03:07:04,951 --> 03:07:09,690
I traveled in the last day of the east 
coast so I lost all but still when I got

3917
03:07:09,691 --> 03:07:12,660
there I was so exhausted that I was 
like,

3918
03:07:12,690 --> 03:07:15,300
at first I was like,
I'll do 500 points right now.

3919
03:07:15,540 --> 03:07:17,580
You asked me to like,
do you think you're working on like if I

3920
03:07:17,581 --> 03:07:19,320
have from my point of view,
no.

3921
03:07:19,440 --> 03:07:20,760
But from your point of view,
yeah.

3922
03:07:20,761 --> 03:07:22,830
You should separate yourself a little 
more from burt and.

3923
03:07:22,831 --> 03:07:25,260
Exactly.
And then when I got to like 2:50,

3924
03:07:25,350 --> 03:07:26,340
I actually,
I go,

3925
03:07:26,700 --> 03:07:28,470
could I go longer?
Yes.

3926
03:07:28,770 --> 03:07:30,990
Could I get to Ari?
There's,

3927
03:07:31,230 --> 03:07:32,063
I'll go.
I just feel like I'm going to die right 

3928
03:07:33,301 --> 03:07:33,930
now.
You know,

3929
03:07:33,930 --> 03:07:36,210
I feel I feel almost sick,
so I was like,

3930
03:07:36,211 --> 03:07:40,530
if I am I going to do another few hours 
until the cutoff.

3931
03:07:40,531 --> 03:07:41,364
I was like,
there's no way I wasn't there a part of 

3932
03:07:42,511 --> 03:07:43,400
it in,
in that.

3933
03:07:43,401 --> 03:07:44,234
I'll say this.
I said,

3934
03:07:44,310 --> 03:07:46,140
when you woke up in the morning you were
like,

3935
03:07:47,670 --> 03:07:50,040
this is unquestionable.
I can do this.

3936
03:07:50,390 --> 03:07:52,890
We're gonna be October 20,
30 day.

3937
03:07:52,891 --> 03:07:55,500
Every day we did this.
There was a party that was like,

3938
03:07:55,590 --> 03:07:57,210
I can work out one more time.

3939
03:07:57,380 --> 03:07:59,500
I can work out.
You know.

3940
03:07:59,580 --> 03:08:01,350
I did think I was.
I really did.

3941
03:08:01,351 --> 03:08:03,380
Honestly think I was out when I texted 
you.

3942
03:08:03,400 --> 03:08:05,010
He got sick and I was like,
I'm out.

3943
03:08:05,210 --> 03:08:07,320
Just no way.
I when I did 43 points,

3944
03:08:07,321 --> 03:08:10,170
so happy that made me so made me.
You have no idea.

3945
03:08:10,430 --> 03:08:14,850
I can tell you last year that me and 
Bert,

3946
03:08:14,900 --> 03:08:15,930
me and Tom,
excuse me,

3947
03:08:15,950 --> 03:08:17,220
like day one,
I'm sober October.

3948
03:08:17,221 --> 03:08:19,980
It was mostly about the sobriety and 
less about the yoga.

3949
03:08:20,760 --> 03:08:24,420
Tom and I were texting like,
should we just drank the entire time and

3950
03:08:24,421 --> 03:08:27,090
not tell them?
And we're both like,

3951
03:08:27,091 --> 03:08:28,320
yeah,
I don't think we either,

3952
03:08:28,321 --> 03:08:30,420
one of us totally trust each other,
not the route and the other,

3953
03:08:31,430 --> 03:08:33,720
but it would have been like,
let's just drink the whole time and then

3954
03:08:33,721 --> 03:08:34,121
be like,
yeah,

3955
03:08:34,121 --> 03:08:36,060
we never even started that.
It would be funny,

3956
03:08:36,860 --> 03:08:37,300
dude.

3957
03:08:37,300 --> 03:08:40,290
I was terrified.
There will be one prank coming my way.

3958
03:08:40,970 --> 03:08:42,720
You know,
when we're in the parking lot after yoga

3959
03:08:42,721 --> 03:08:43,411
class,
you were like,

3960
03:08:43,411 --> 03:08:45,520
let's get blood tests for your day.
Yeah,

3961
03:08:45,530 --> 03:08:46,363
yeah.
Hey,

3962
03:08:46,370 --> 03:08:48,360
you freaked out.
I was like,

3963
03:08:49,200 --> 03:08:50,970
what was the story about?
Trust us.

3964
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:52,110
Somebody said,
wait,

3965
03:08:52,111 --> 03:08:55,690
did you have to get rid of Zz?
Wanted to do a.

3966
03:08:56,140 --> 03:08:56,973
I got a Lamborghini Lamborghini.
I don't even know if we said this last 

3967
03:09:03,900 --> 03:09:05,370
year,
but I since I told him,

3968
03:09:05,371 --> 03:09:06,204
because I ran into him the night before.
The next day when we're going to the 

3969
03:09:09,091 --> 03:09:12,150
15th last,
my phone reason is Joe.

3970
03:09:12,450 --> 03:09:14,700
And he goes,
are you in a white Lamborghini?

3971
03:09:15,810 --> 03:09:17,310
And I go,
yeah.

3972
03:09:17,700 --> 03:09:18,331
And he goes,
yeah,

3973
03:09:18,331 --> 03:09:19,790
you're right in front of me.
And he goes,

3974
03:09:20,190 --> 03:09:23,820
since you told me you got a Lamborghini,
I assumed that this fucking ridiculously

3975
03:09:24,750 --> 03:09:25,583
was yours.
So then I pulled in and we look for a 

3976
03:09:27,871 --> 03:09:29,400
place to park and I was like,
he's like,

3977
03:09:29,430 --> 03:09:33,830
nobody's gonna fuck with this thing man.
But the whole,

3978
03:09:34,610 --> 03:09:35,443
it was so great.
The best part of this whole thing was 

3979
03:09:39,420 --> 03:09:43,920
like a day after I had told Bert that it
was a joke.

3980
03:09:44,550 --> 03:09:45,540
He called me.
He goes,

3981
03:09:46,440 --> 03:09:50,130
I did look at motorcycles,
motorcycles,

3982
03:09:50,700 --> 03:09:54,220
because I thought you got to treat.
I got a Lamborghini.

3983
03:09:54,400 --> 03:09:57,560
I'm still like that too.
I want to drink tonight.

3984
03:09:58,360 --> 03:10:00,600
I want to treat that drink.
I want a treat.

3985
03:10:00,640 --> 03:10:05,640
I want to treat you ranked in a 
Lamborghini.

3986
03:10:06,581 --> 03:10:09,430
Just a fuck would burn.
Oh my God.

3987
03:10:09,431 --> 03:10:10,990
It was great.
And I was like,

3988
03:10:11,180 --> 03:10:12,013
yeah,
I don't know if you know who the fuck 

3989
03:10:13,560 --> 03:10:17,230
you fuck it up because you go look at 
the registration.

3990
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:19,750
You said that.
And I go look at it.

3991
03:10:20,110 --> 03:10:21,840
I told you that.
Fucking look at it,

3992
03:10:21,850 --> 03:10:26,010
look at it.
Oh,

3993
03:10:26,011 --> 03:10:27,460
look at.
Oh God.

3994
03:10:27,800 --> 03:10:30,820
Because that gross body I had that was 
so far better than our other bureaus,

3995
03:10:31,360 --> 03:10:36,360
so much better do you think he inserted.
But my girlfriend was like,

3996
03:10:39,430 --> 03:10:40,930
my body was like,
oh wait,

3997
03:10:41,060 --> 03:10:41,891
what?
Let's put it.

3998
03:10:41,891 --> 03:10:42,724
How long did it take?
You can serve in a month standing on a 

3999
03:10:44,801 --> 03:10:46,150
board.
How much time?

4000
03:10:46,480 --> 03:10:48,460
Wow.
That's a great question.

4001
03:10:48,480 --> 03:10:53,480
For 31 days to catch waves is their feet
get tired.

4002
03:10:53,740 --> 03:10:54,573
Here's the thing.
We always know that we ended up doing 

4003
03:10:56,171 --> 03:10:58,000
the running order.
There's no punished.

4004
03:10:58,030 --> 03:11:01,510
I'm not trying to fucking run up on you,
but there is no punishment this year.

4005
03:11:01,511 --> 03:11:03,240
Right?
For coming in last year.

4006
03:11:04,120 --> 03:11:05,230
So next year.
Same thing.

4007
03:11:05,231 --> 03:11:06,280
Should be.
Wait.

4008
03:11:06,850 --> 03:11:07,170
No,
no,

4009
03:11:07,170 --> 03:11:07,721
no,
no.

4010
03:11:07,721 --> 03:11:12,721
I don't want you all wanted to win this.
It gives us a pretty solid.

4011
03:11:13,760 --> 03:11:15,550
I'm just saying this,
I'm saying this,

4012
03:11:15,880 --> 03:11:19,570
we should do something to celebrate and 
I'm just saying forget about winning and

4013
03:11:19,571 --> 03:11:20,404
losing for someone who came in.
Second number one in a non astrix I 

4014
03:11:26,160 --> 03:11:26,993
would say

4015
03:11:29,550 --> 03:11:34,550
I do.
I have a full

4016
03:11:39,540 --> 03:11:40,373
Jose Conseco wikipedia.
I would say that my boat shoot carries 

4017
03:11:42,901 --> 03:11:47,880
some extra weight and I'm saying to go 
to Chiang Mai,

4018
03:11:47,881 --> 03:11:48,714
Thailand,
you really want to watch some fucking 

4019
03:11:50,131 --> 03:11:52,470
kickboxing.
I think it would be from America,

4020
03:11:52,530 --> 03:11:53,363
absolutely.
But I think we can do to have the where 

4021
03:11:56,521 --> 03:11:58,770
you would all enjoy your type of thing.
Also,

4022
03:11:58,860 --> 03:12:01,560
we don't stay at a hostel in a hotel.
Sure.

4023
03:12:02,760 --> 03:12:05,010
And just do that.
Smoke some cigars.

4024
03:12:05,011 --> 03:12:09,150
Get drunk on beer.
I think my vote is as number two.

4025
03:12:09,300 --> 03:12:10,133
Should hangs a lot with me.
Please take some time and think about 

4026
03:12:13,291 --> 03:12:15,360
it.
But I like to travel agent orange.

4027
03:12:15,400 --> 03:12:16,590
Fear.
I do.

4028
03:12:16,591 --> 03:12:17,850
I do.
I do something like that.

4029
03:12:17,851 --> 03:12:22,740
I would have no problem with that.
So does this year's lost count?

4030
03:12:23,310 --> 03:12:27,530
Oh everyone something.
Oh No,

4031
03:12:27,670 --> 03:12:28,011
no,
no,

4032
03:12:28,011 --> 03:12:28,844
no,
no.

4033
03:12:28,990 --> 03:12:30,760
Do you think you get drank?
Drank.

4034
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:32,260
Piss.
Piss.

4035
03:12:33,650 --> 03:12:37,830
I gotTa pee real bad.
Mean Do pee right here for you.

4036
03:12:38,090 --> 03:12:39,770
He,
he'll drink it.

4037
03:12:40,200 --> 03:12:45,200
Burt drank at full Kombucha of pis.
But wait,

4038
03:12:45,470 --> 03:12:49,190
wait,
Joel,

4039
03:12:49,800 --> 03:12:51,470
would you really piss in it?
No I'm not.

4040
03:12:51,471 --> 03:12:51,980
I'm not drinking

4041
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:56,520
piss guys.
I say,

4042
03:12:56,720 --> 03:12:58,790
you know,
drinking piss with.

4043
03:12:59,090 --> 03:13:00,090
Listen,
I need a car.

4044
03:13:00,180 --> 03:13:02,280
I need to give a treat to the team.
Lost.

4045
03:13:02,590 --> 03:13:03,423
I lost me.
And then I don't know what that tree 

4046
03:13:04,760 --> 03:13:06,640
will be,
but it should be a treat.

4047
03:13:06,650 --> 03:13:08,460
You don't have to do shit.
But Hey,

4048
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:13,910
for the hotel check in Chiang Mai,
it will cost you $700 for four days.

4049
03:13:13,911 --> 03:13:16,280
For each one of us have a room or in a 
giant,

4050
03:13:16,281 --> 03:13:18,020
whatever we decide to do,
I'm going to get.

4051
03:13:18,021 --> 03:13:19,310
I'm going to definitely be a part of 
that tree.

4052
03:13:20,230 --> 03:13:24,620
Do for land traveling,
trip first class tickets,

4053
03:13:24,621 --> 03:13:29,621
and 10 for fans that listen by those 
dogs.

4054
03:13:31,460 --> 03:13:34,010
I'll tell you this right now,
if we do a,

4055
03:13:34,220 --> 03:13:35,053
we do Madison Square Garden for the 
private jet to take us all to fucking 

4056
03:13:38,301 --> 03:13:41,930
New York.
This private jet aesthetic is troubling.

4057
03:13:42,110 --> 03:13:45,770
You guys are saying you're such trash,
a fucking horrible,

4058
03:13:45,771 --> 03:13:47,250
wasteful thing to get to it.

4059
03:13:47,260 --> 03:13:48,320
Let's do it.
What?

4060
03:13:48,350 --> 03:13:51,570
What book?
Madison Square Garden.

4061
03:13:51,600 --> 03:13:54,800
I'll pay for the train your dragon son.
I'll take.

4062
03:13:54,860 --> 03:13:56,950
I'll pay for the private jet together so
I'll miss you guys.

4063
03:13:57,810 --> 03:14:00,140
Just the three of us.
How surprising was this month?

4064
03:14:00,800 --> 03:14:02,330
Hardcore.
For me it was very,

4065
03:14:02,331 --> 03:14:05,330
very surprising.
I keep surprising to you though,

4066
03:14:05,390 --> 03:14:07,790
where it went.
It went so competitive.

4067
03:14:09,410 --> 03:14:12,320
Nobody ever separated themselves,
fully accept you,

4068
03:14:12,770 --> 03:14:13,603
but even if you.
It was still like I could maybe catch 

4069
03:14:16,461 --> 03:14:17,294
him if he stopped,
like when you went on a hunting trip 

4070
03:14:18,500 --> 03:14:20,900
when you said I'm not going to be 
working on for the next five days.

4071
03:14:20,990 --> 03:14:22,220
We were all like,
oh,

4072
03:14:22,221 --> 03:14:23,054
we got a chance to catch Rogan and pass 
him and then when you worked on the 

4073
03:14:25,731 --> 03:14:26,120
trip,
but like,

4074
03:14:26,120 --> 03:14:27,140
oh,
that's where we're fucked.

4075
03:14:27,950 --> 03:14:32,950
But like it was surprising that we kept 
fighting the whole way.

4076
03:14:34,100 --> 03:14:35,690
It was,
it was unrelenting.

4077
03:14:35,720 --> 03:14:38,360
It wasn't anything I could relax.
No,

4078
03:14:38,490 --> 03:14:40,910
that was one time that I went to Vegas 
for the UFC.

4079
03:14:40,911 --> 03:14:44,030
I took three days off and I came back 
and I was in last place.

4080
03:14:44,031 --> 03:14:45,080
I was like,
whoa.

4081
03:14:45,290 --> 03:14:46,123
And then Bert,
you helped me there too because he 

4082
03:14:47,391 --> 03:14:48,224
tweeted that he tweeted that I was in 
last place and you even posted the 

4083
03:14:51,921 --> 03:14:54,410
numbers on instagram and I was like,
oh,

4084
03:14:54,411 --> 03:14:56,770
okay.
So that really motivated you.

4085
03:14:56,900 --> 03:14:58,550
One hundred percent stupid.
Here's why.

4086
03:14:58,730 --> 03:15:03,110
Here's why.
A silly boy motivated by everything.

4087
03:15:03,111 --> 03:15:07,550
That can be a motivator.
I don't let something not motivate me.

4088
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:12,230
Why would I do that?
So to not know who you are.

4089
03:15:12,720 --> 03:15:14,110
I'm like,
Oh,

4090
03:15:14,370 --> 03:15:18,580
oh,
what am I,

4091
03:15:19,390 --> 03:15:21,620
I never,
I never hear what you say and say,

4092
03:15:21,621 --> 03:15:22,840
well,
birds,

4093
03:15:22,850 --> 03:15:24,720
a great guy and you know,
I know.

4094
03:15:24,740 --> 03:15:26,780
He was just joking around and doing this
for publicity.

4095
03:15:26,900 --> 03:15:28,310
I'm like,
I can do that later.

4096
03:15:28,460 --> 03:15:29,293
That doesn't help me right now.
Right now it helps me have you tell me 

4097
03:15:33,020 --> 03:15:34,790
that you're going to beat me.
And I'm like,

4098
03:15:34,820 --> 03:15:36,890
Oh yeah,
that's true.

4099
03:15:37,030 --> 03:15:38,420
Okay,
here we go.

4100
03:15:38,421 --> 03:15:42,450
I did a cruise at the beginning of this 
month with Bobby Kelly and I thought,

4101
03:15:42,451 --> 03:15:43,284
I told him about the whole thing started
and I'm looking at everyone's numbers 

4102
03:15:45,621 --> 03:15:47,510
for the first time and I said,
yeah,

4103
03:15:47,511 --> 03:15:49,040
Rogan's in it.
I'm taunting him.

4104
03:15:49,590 --> 03:15:51,600
And Bobby goes,
why would you ever do that?

4105
03:15:51,990 --> 03:15:53,400
I always show man.
And he goes,

4106
03:15:53,401 --> 03:15:55,230
no,
I don't think you know Joe.

4107
03:15:55,290 --> 03:15:55,771
I go,
no,

4108
03:15:55,771 --> 03:15:57,060
I definitely know Joe.
He goes,

4109
03:15:57,450 --> 03:15:58,283
never taught him.
And then halfway through the cruise I 

4110
03:16:00,031 --> 03:16:01,380
was like,
I think I fucked up man.

4111
03:16:02,530 --> 03:16:07,530
He told you.
He told you stupid dude was a good month

4112
03:16:12,290 --> 03:16:13,850
though.
It was like,

4113
03:16:13,890 --> 03:16:15,500
would it not be like I got it.

4114
03:16:15,510 --> 03:16:16,343
I went in like 10 years cooler if I had 
just been like super country and 

4115
03:16:22,171 --> 03:16:24,870
respectful.
If one of us could have no,

4116
03:16:24,930 --> 03:16:29,670
I do not like the fucking game play.
I liked this bullshit of like talk shit,

4117
03:16:29,671 --> 03:16:30,504
man.
Be As loud as you can be to support my 

4118
03:16:33,930 --> 03:16:37,610
fucking Chiang Mai idea.
Came in dead last supportive.

4119
03:16:37,720 --> 03:16:40,430
I'm in.
I'm in trying to go to a show.

4120
03:16:40,440 --> 03:16:42,410
You like those kickboxing fights.
Loved them.

4121
03:16:44,070 --> 03:16:45,090
I love.
Listen.

4122
03:16:45,100 --> 03:16:48,940
I even did some commentary for 
kickboxing in California really?

4123
03:16:48,980 --> 03:16:49,741
For Moy.
Tai.

4124
03:16:49,741 --> 03:16:51,480
Yeah.
Way back before UFC.

4125
03:16:51,720 --> 03:16:52,553
Before I ever did UFC commentary.
I did come from in the moment bikes 

4126
03:16:57,001 --> 03:16:59,640
because I can take her to some cool 
places was do it.

4127
03:17:00,600 --> 03:17:01,433
You're the only wild card.
You don't seem like you would go to a 

4128
03:17:04,561 --> 03:17:07,650
place.
I would go really for a short term trip.

4129
03:17:07,660 --> 03:17:08,430
Yeah.
Orchard April?

4130
03:17:08,430 --> 03:17:09,720
Yeah,
Monday through Friday.

4131
03:17:09,810 --> 03:17:10,643
On first.
How long you guys think you could serve 

4132
03:17:13,331 --> 03:17:16,470
for a whole month?
This is for our competition next year.

4133
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:21,560
How might someone get Kelly slater on 
the phone and let's find out how long is

4134
03:17:21,570 --> 03:17:22,590
it?
Sounds respectful,

4135
03:17:22,650 --> 03:17:24,210
so I don't wanna throw out big numbers 
right now,

4136
03:17:24,211 --> 03:17:26,040
but I'm thinking four days.
Sebastian,

4137
03:17:26,820 --> 03:17:28,980
what's up bro?
For days,

4138
03:17:29,130 --> 03:17:29,963
I don't think it's possible.
Stay in one of those things for too 

4139
03:17:31,711 --> 03:17:32,790
long.
Are you interested?

4140
03:17:32,791 --> 03:17:37,170
Even surfing.
Never been scared of sharks.

4141
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:42,680
That's why we go to Joe.
Joe,

4142
03:17:43,900 --> 03:17:45,600
Joe hates all monster.
We can.

4143
03:17:47,710 --> 03:17:51,180
We can all go and surf together like we 
did with the hot yoga,

4144
03:17:51,181 --> 03:17:52,980
but we're all trying to catch better 
waves.

4145
03:17:53,190 --> 03:17:56,730
Monsters are real.
We would have to enlist and Kelly slater

4146
03:17:56,731 --> 03:17:58,570
surf camp for whatever.
No Bro,

4147
03:17:58,610 --> 03:17:58,981
Bro.
Bro.

4148
03:17:58,981 --> 03:18:01,010
We got this.
We got this guys.

4149
03:18:01,110 --> 03:18:06,110
Or I can spend five days on a search for
750.

4150
03:18:07,271 --> 03:18:11,190
To be honest.
I liked putting it aside every October.

4151
03:18:11,220 --> 03:18:14,870
This is my challenge to you.
What's your challenge?

4152
03:18:14,880 --> 03:18:18,900
That scared off social media for stupid,
stupid.

4153
03:18:18,901 --> 03:18:19,734
We all just agreed with some of us got 
to sell tickets for a body shots world 

4154
03:18:22,111 --> 03:18:23,200
tour.
No,

4155
03:18:23,320 --> 03:18:26,100
no.
I already know what you can do.

4156
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:26,993
You could agree to.
They stay off social media and if you 

4157
03:18:28,681 --> 03:18:30,960
have anything that you have to post 
about something,

4158
03:18:31,110 --> 03:18:36,110
you send it to some sort of a manager,
they put it up for you.

4159
03:18:39,230 --> 03:18:40,410
You can do that thing.

4160
03:18:40,540 --> 03:18:41,373
Yeah.
You sent it to people to send him an 

4161
03:18:42,181 --> 03:18:42,961
email and say,
hey,

4162
03:18:42,961 --> 03:18:45,120
send this tomorrow or send this to you 
soon as you can.

4163
03:18:45,190 --> 03:18:46,350
If it's after 10:00
PM,

4164
03:18:46,351 --> 03:18:47,184
Cet,
wait til it's a good move and you don't 

4165
03:18:49,811 --> 03:18:51,790
check it.
They only move.

4166
03:18:51,850 --> 03:18:54,130
It's not the only move,
but it's a good move.

4167
03:18:55,210 --> 03:18:57,220
I think it's not just a good move for 
us.

4168
03:18:57,250 --> 03:18:58,083
It's a good move for everybody,
like you shouldn't believe off the 

4169
03:19:00,980 --> 03:19:01,813
amount.
Limit the amount of variables you have 

4170
03:19:03,491 --> 03:19:07,360
to process because if you don't,
you will process them correctly,

4171
03:19:07,540 --> 03:19:10,390
so you'll be dealing with a bunch of 
information that someone would get.

4172
03:19:10,570 --> 03:19:13,420
Some of it you'll get right and some of 
the it'll get wrong,

4173
03:19:13,810 --> 03:19:14,643
but you never know what the real 
balances because too much of it is 

4174
03:19:16,901 --> 03:19:19,400
coming at you all the time,
all the time.

4175
03:19:19,480 --> 03:19:22,900
Can't stop and think for a second which 
you love it,

4176
03:19:23,050 --> 03:19:24,900
which I don't mind it.

4177
03:19:25,300 --> 03:19:27,020
This is your wheel house.
Yeah,

4178
03:19:27,050 --> 03:19:27,370
yeah,
yeah,

4179
03:19:27,370 --> 03:19:27,731
yeah,
yeah.

4180
03:19:27,731 --> 03:19:28,930
Dude,
let me tell you something.

4181
03:19:30,280 --> 03:19:33,100
The same thing can be argued about 
podcasting.

4182
03:19:33,460 --> 03:19:34,151
People go,
hey,

4183
03:19:34,151 --> 03:19:36,700
we're talking too much.
We shouldn't be talking this much,

4184
03:19:37,060 --> 03:19:39,340
but it's something that our fans dig and
I dig.

4185
03:19:39,400 --> 03:19:39,880
Look,
dude,

4186
03:19:39,880 --> 03:19:42,640
this doesn't affect.
That doesn't affect your own psyche.

4187
03:19:42,790 --> 03:19:45,500
It does.
It gets you start getting angry.

4188
03:19:46,900 --> 03:19:48,370
Don't look at.
Don't read comments.

4189
03:19:48,380 --> 03:19:49,800
Don't look at likes.
Don't look at it.

4190
03:19:49,950 --> 03:19:54,950
I argued I would too many people dig it 
too.

4191
03:19:56,441 --> 03:19:59,720
Not to walk away from it in my opinion,
and I know I dig it.

4192
03:19:59,780 --> 03:20:04,210
No need to walk away.
I think already saying more like breaks.

4193
03:20:04,750 --> 03:20:05,583
Take a break.
If you guys could totally deal with a 

4194
03:20:07,721 --> 03:20:08,554
month off of all that Shit,
you more than anybody and then you and 

4195
03:20:11,891 --> 03:20:15,040
then you have just like not being on 
that.

4196
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:18,340
Not letting it affect your opinion.
Just walk outside and view the world for

4197
03:20:18,341 --> 03:20:21,220
what it is for a month.
It wouldn't kill you.

4198
03:20:21,400 --> 03:20:22,233
No,
I agree.

4199
03:20:22,420 --> 03:20:27,420
But you could get your business shit 
part done just by email or post this for

4200
03:20:27,791 --> 03:20:29,830
me and then never looking at it.
I don't know.

4201
03:20:29,831 --> 03:20:32,390
I'd argue against it.
You could do that.

4202
03:20:32,900 --> 03:20:33,733
I know.
I definitely could not and I don't want 

4203
03:20:34,961 --> 03:20:36,700
to like it's different.
I.

4204
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:37,533
Dude,
I dig.

4205
03:20:37,750 --> 03:20:41,230
I dig listening to you talk to Kelly 
slater.

4206
03:20:41,290 --> 03:20:43,120
I thought that was.
Gives me joy.

4207
03:20:43,200 --> 03:20:45,080
You can have a podcast.
No,

4208
03:20:45,081 --> 03:20:45,371
no,
no.

4209
03:20:45,371 --> 03:20:46,840
You're talking about getting rid of your
fucking phone.

4210
03:20:46,841 --> 03:20:49,270
That's all of it.
How would I know Joe had Kelly slater on

4211
03:20:50,410 --> 03:20:51,640
social media?
Yeah,

4212
03:20:51,730 --> 03:20:54,540
but I would say probably the best way.
A great flip phone for a month.

4213
03:20:55,260 --> 03:20:57,340
Yeah.
If you can get off all social media from

4214
03:20:57,341 --> 03:20:58,600
moms that would help you a lot.

4215
03:20:58,900 --> 03:21:00,790
I.
There was never a moment where I thought

4216
03:21:00,791 --> 03:21:01,624
that you guys are cheating.
Like you really didn't stop that 

4217
03:21:04,661 --> 03:21:06,040
classes.
Oh right.

4218
03:21:06,041 --> 03:21:06,491
No,
no,

4219
03:21:06,491 --> 03:21:07,251
no.
I never know.

4220
03:21:07,251 --> 03:21:09,600
Or even this month I was like,
you know,

4221
03:21:09,640 --> 03:21:10,473
the worst case scenario would be 
somebody to be holding back where they 

4222
03:21:13,271 --> 03:21:16,190
weren't releasing information,
the system.

4223
03:21:17,060 --> 03:21:22,060
But I had already prepared for that.
You got so far ahead.

4224
03:21:22,390 --> 03:21:25,240
I wanted to save up for like seven days.
I couldn't trust that my zone thing.

4225
03:21:25,390 --> 03:21:28,210
It said 13 hours,
13 hours.

4226
03:21:28,230 --> 03:21:30,610
It lost a good 40 minutes.
One time.

4227
03:21:30,670 --> 03:21:33,010
I think you're looking at social media 
in a bad way.

4228
03:21:33,910 --> 03:21:37,380
It overall it shifts your to the 
negative.

4229
03:21:39,390 --> 03:21:41,820
What you need to do is shift that and go
like,

4230
03:21:42,130 --> 03:21:45,800
what are my positives or negatives?
It's the same as a podcast man.

4231
03:21:45,801 --> 03:21:48,680
There's no difference in instagram and a
podcast.

4232
03:21:49,040 --> 03:21:50,480
There's no difference.
Why?

4233
03:21:50,960 --> 03:21:53,720
Because it's information man is sharing 
cool show,

4234
03:21:53,721 --> 03:21:55,150
but it's what you're looking at.
No,

4235
03:21:55,160 --> 03:21:58,790
but I feel like sometimes you haven't 
been the fan that may be the outsider.

4236
03:21:58,791 --> 03:22:01,510
Has the person lives in this right now 
goes to die.

4237
03:22:01,511 --> 03:22:04,790
Like when you do instagrams like that 
instagram you did about you eating drugs

4238
03:22:04,791 --> 03:22:09,770
and smoking and drinking.
It gave made me giggle post for me,

4239
03:22:12,480 --> 03:22:16,200
but I don't have to be looking at the 
responses at minute by minute.

4240
03:22:16,280 --> 03:22:19,370
We're all agreeing on that.
You're saying get off your phone,

4241
03:22:19,371 --> 03:22:20,204
get off social media saying that because
of the impulse to look at the responses 

4242
03:22:24,600 --> 03:22:25,660
and.
No,

4243
03:22:25,790 --> 03:22:26,660
I agree.
I agree.

4244
03:22:26,800 --> 03:22:27,633
I hear somebody go and like Joel said,
he said he brought a response to 

4245
03:22:29,991 --> 03:22:30,770
something I did.

4246
03:22:30,770 --> 03:22:32,770
Maybe even that video is going,
oh,

4247
03:22:32,780 --> 03:22:34,820
you should probably kill yourself.
And he said it.

4248
03:22:34,880 --> 03:22:35,713
One hundred 68 lights,
a lot of lights for a comment and then 

4249
03:22:38,001 --> 03:22:38,751
he said,
some people are like,

4250
03:22:38,751 --> 03:22:40,550
how dare you?
You don't know that guy.

4251
03:22:40,880 --> 03:22:41,271
And he's like,
oh,

4252
03:22:41,271 --> 03:22:42,104
you just don't.
It's like,

4253
03:22:42,220 --> 03:22:43,160
I'll just delete it.
And it's like,

4254
03:22:43,970 --> 03:22:45,620
well no,
that time.

4255
03:22:45,890 --> 03:22:50,750
Fuck you bring it down because of 
responses on fucking instagram.

4256
03:22:50,810 --> 03:22:52,580
Do that.
What did that whole.

4257
03:22:53,210 --> 03:22:55,880
It's the whole thing.
Five Dude.

4258
03:22:55,881 --> 03:22:57,960
I have people just block people.
Yeah.

4259
03:22:58,160 --> 03:23:01,520
Well you know,
there's a lot just getting your mind out

4260
03:23:01,521 --> 03:23:02,600
there.
They just don't.

4261
03:23:02,660 --> 03:23:05,660
They don't feel good and they want you 
to feel shitty too.

4262
03:23:05,900 --> 03:23:06,733
Even if they're right about some things.
The way they address it is what the 

4263
03:23:08,811 --> 03:23:09,644
problem is.
They're blurting out and oozing anger 

4264
03:23:12,830 --> 03:23:16,490
and disproportionate amounts and it 
affects everybody around them.

4265
03:23:16,490 --> 03:23:17,980
And it affects all of us.
There's,

4266
03:23:18,280 --> 03:23:18,951
yeah,
there's that.

4267
03:23:18,951 --> 03:23:20,470
And there's also just the amount of time
Tom,

4268
03:23:20,510 --> 03:23:21,380
you saw him,
you said you like,

4269
03:23:21,410 --> 03:23:24,430
let me just try to wake my kids up 
before I check my internet or what?

4270
03:23:24,431 --> 03:23:25,264
Exactly.
It's just a matter of time or spending 

4271
03:23:27,561 --> 03:23:28,394
on it too much.
It might to you good to see what it 

4272
03:23:30,041 --> 03:23:33,620
seems like for a month off it where 
you're like,

4273
03:23:33,710 --> 03:23:34,543
oh I think have a lot of time in my day.
It's overall positive to do it the way 

4274
03:23:39,141 --> 03:23:39,974
you're describing.
I do think that it definitely for sure 

4275
03:23:44,030 --> 03:23:46,280
plays a part in our business.
You need it for certain things.

4276
03:23:46,480 --> 03:23:48,170
But like you could do the thing where 
you go,

4277
03:23:48,770 --> 03:23:49,603
yeah,
like let me find a way every time I 

4278
03:23:50,970 --> 03:23:52,760
think I need it for this.
Like okay,

4279
03:23:52,761 --> 03:23:55,100
but can I.
is there a way around that?

4280
03:23:55,610 --> 03:23:56,443
I don't know.
Just when I see someone make my life 

4281
03:23:57,771 --> 03:23:58,604
less happy it.
But then there's also people that make 

4282
03:24:03,111 --> 03:24:03,944
your life happier.
There's a lot of really hilarious shit 

4283
03:24:06,320 --> 03:24:08,900
online.
Adam Green Tree,

4284
03:24:08,901 --> 03:24:10,610
man.
Fuck everything you're saying right now.

4285
03:24:10,970 --> 03:24:14,080
I like watching his life like and then 
I'm just.

4286
03:24:14,330 --> 03:24:18,080
I'm just Cam Newton man.
He does those running videos next to the

4287
03:24:18,081 --> 03:24:20,770
car and I go,
I gotta get out there and do something.

4288
03:24:20,790 --> 03:24:22,580
There's been Cameron Hayes or Cam 
Newton.

4289
03:24:22,720 --> 03:24:25,080
Goddammit man.
He took from the panthers,

4290
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:26,433
quarterback for the panthers.
The fucking lead singer of Steel 

4291
03:24:30,930 --> 03:24:32,280
Panther.
Yeah.

4292
03:24:33,050 --> 03:24:37,700
Runs about his car with his half mask.
Hammered man.

4293
03:24:37,940 --> 03:24:42,940
Shout out to Cam Cam.
Both Newton and it's hollow,

4294
03:24:44,750 --> 03:24:45,583
Bruh.

4295
03:24:48,420 --> 03:24:50,640
I can't believe we did this much.
Working out your guys'.

4296
03:24:50,641 --> 03:24:55,260
That's fucking nuts and think about how 
much more weight we're carrying.

4297
03:24:55,261 --> 03:24:56,500
Then you seriously?
Yeah.

4298
03:24:56,900 --> 03:24:58,350
That's one of my favorites was burt was 
like,

4299
03:24:58,380 --> 03:24:59,170
oh,
red heartbreak.

4300
03:24:59,170 --> 03:25:00,790
It was be going up because he doesn't 
work out.

4301
03:25:00,890 --> 03:25:01,723
It could be.
It could also be that you're lifting 70 

4302
03:25:06,001 --> 03:25:08,040
pounds more than me with every step you 
take.

4303
03:25:08,460 --> 03:25:12,540
That's a possibility to think about my 
impression of already.

4304
03:25:12,580 --> 03:25:17,580
Hope guys would more rest with he's 
going to try to kill you,

4305
03:25:21,900 --> 03:25:22,733
but we all did it.
Who you think you could tap out someone 

4306
03:25:24,331 --> 03:25:25,164
first and I had no training.
He definitely has the most training in 

4307
03:25:27,391 --> 03:25:29,650
Jujitsu fight.
If you could get on top of it,

4308
03:25:29,651 --> 03:25:31,830
you could do something to me,
but if I could stop you from doing that,

4309
03:25:31,831 --> 03:25:33,680
I would for sure be you.
He understood our.

4310
03:25:33,681 --> 03:25:36,310
He understands what's happening.
Probably wouldn't be.

4311
03:25:36,340 --> 03:25:39,180
You wouldn't know what to defend.
I've seen him choke people.

4312
03:25:41,340 --> 03:25:45,830
Exactly the case dude.
Next year we should do.

4313
03:25:46,030 --> 03:25:49,650
Let's propose it.
Let's go to worlds.

4314
03:25:49,830 --> 03:25:52,400
Let's do the surf.
We cut.

4315
03:25:52,440 --> 03:25:54,030
We got a kit.
In my opinion.

4316
03:25:54,031 --> 03:25:54,830
Can I just say,
well,

4317
03:25:54,830 --> 03:25:55,663
I need to cut the surf contest in half.
We should do in six months from now 

4318
03:25:58,800 --> 03:25:59,633
because you know Kelly slater can get 
this lined up and the weather will be 

4319
03:26:01,741 --> 03:26:06,741
perfect when w in six months from now,
later when we suck so hard.

4320
03:26:06,871 --> 03:26:07,704
We'd never surfed was he would not want 
any doing this or I know I have no 

4321
03:26:15,601 --> 03:26:17,070
interest in this list number.
Wait,

4322
03:26:17,071 --> 03:26:20,370
let's do this and Kelly slater on top of
this.

4323
03:26:20,610 --> 03:26:24,090
Let's do also.
Wait,

4324
03:26:25,440 --> 03:26:27,810
will you do one round,
one round?

4325
03:26:27,840 --> 03:26:29,340
Yep.
I'm in MMA.

4326
03:26:29,341 --> 03:26:33,240
Like UFC rules fight against Ari.
Oh No,

4327
03:26:33,241 --> 03:26:33,571
no,
no.

4328
03:26:33,571 --> 03:26:35,250
I would never do that.
I'm down.

4329
03:26:35,410 --> 03:26:35,890
No,
no,

4330
03:26:35,890 --> 03:26:36,351
no,
no,

4331
03:26:36,351 --> 03:26:36,950
no,
no.

4332
03:26:36,950 --> 03:26:41,950
We have fun competition,
Kimmy.

4333
03:26:43,410 --> 03:26:45,060
No hitting.
Okay.

4334
03:26:45,120 --> 03:26:45,953
There can be no hitting.
Here's the problem that you can choke 

4335
03:26:48,091 --> 03:26:49,210
each other.
Want one,

4336
03:26:49,211 --> 03:26:51,810
choke each other.
The problem with hitting is that shit is

4337
03:26:51,811 --> 03:26:54,030
permanent.
The damage is real.

4338
03:26:54,060 --> 03:26:54,893
All right,
fine.

4339
03:26:55,260 --> 03:26:56,093
When you're in your forties,
you don't want to be getting punched in 

4340
03:26:58,291 --> 03:27:03,291
the face or one of your best friends.
He knocks you on surfing.

4341
03:27:03,910 --> 03:27:08,910
Jada shocks much combat Jujitsu.
That snow hit each other.

4342
03:27:10,361 --> 03:27:12,900
I'm sick birds.
How old did you turn for real?

4343
03:27:13,110 --> 03:27:15,120
40 six.
For Real,

4344
03:27:15,700 --> 03:27:18,490
for real,
for real,

4345
03:27:20,450 --> 03:27:22,610
for real age.
Wikipedia page.

4346
03:27:22,920 --> 03:27:26,310
Now what's the real age went?
Come on.

4347
03:27:26,430 --> 03:27:31,430
Tell them the real age children.
40 six.

4348
03:27:32,490 --> 03:27:34,290
When your brother was in the Vietnam 
War,

4349
03:27:43,180 --> 03:27:47,140
Truman went on TV and said,
when he said,

4350
03:27:47,141 --> 03:27:51,810
did your whole family freak out or no 
backup?

4351
03:27:51,910 --> 03:27:56,910
When Kennedy was assassinated,
fake media,

4352
03:27:58,871 --> 03:28:00,850
man.
I'm 42,

4353
03:28:00,880 --> 03:28:02,170
47 years old.
Where did six?

4354
03:28:03,010 --> 03:28:05,130
40 six?
Forty three.

4355
03:28:08,620 --> 03:28:12,130
Forty one.
I'm 41 years old.

4356
03:28:12,170 --> 03:28:13,690
Joseph one.
I know.

4357
03:28:13,691 --> 03:28:17,220
This is what it says on his blood 
pressure medication.

4358
03:28:17,230 --> 03:28:19,810
I don't want to have a stroke.
I don't know.

4359
03:28:19,860 --> 03:28:20,693
I mean I know I'm going to stay on my 
blood pressure medication until the 

4360
03:28:22,361 --> 03:28:26,420
doctor says to get off it.
I stopped you.

4361
03:28:26,440 --> 03:28:29,320
Is there a path to office?
Should I be going on to lose weight?

4362
03:28:30,400 --> 03:28:32,650
How much?
I probably have to get to two.

4363
03:28:32,651 --> 03:28:33,484
Oh,
five.

4364
03:28:33,580 --> 03:28:37,280
Fuck my blood pressure medicine,
I think.

4365
03:28:37,290 --> 03:28:38,310
Right.
What are you on now?

4366
03:28:40,040 --> 03:28:43,480
I was 28 at the end of the contest.
Yeah,

4367
03:28:43,720 --> 03:28:47,080
probably no joke.
Probably to 35.

4368
03:28:47,081 --> 03:28:48,190
I'm guessing.
Two.

4369
03:28:48,240 --> 03:28:49,073
Oh five.
What were you at the end of the 

4370
03:28:50,740 --> 03:28:53,590
challenge will look to.
I don't know.

4371
03:28:53,591 --> 03:28:55,000
I don't really remember to be honest 
with you.

4372
03:28:55,540 --> 03:28:59,750
I think Jamie pulled that up less than 
that buddy.

4373
03:28:59,930 --> 03:29:01,150
He was 13.

4374
03:29:01,280 --> 03:29:06,280
Then final way in score was two.
16 to 19 right now.

4375
03:29:07,190 --> 03:29:08,560
Tom,
what are you at right now?

4376
03:29:08,561 --> 03:29:11,030
Because you don't want to put it back on
after the photo.

4377
03:29:12,010 --> 03:29:12,431
Okay.
Yeah,

4378
03:29:12,431 --> 03:29:13,131
sure.
Whatever.

4379
03:29:13,131 --> 03:29:13,961
Whatever.
First of all,

4380
03:29:13,961 --> 03:29:15,850
don't forget this.
Don't forget this.

4381
03:29:16,180 --> 03:29:21,180
The way in was with a dramatic for 
nonprofessionals dramatic water cut.

4382
03:29:22,950 --> 03:29:24,150
Okay.
Fuck.

4383
03:29:24,160 --> 03:29:24,993
Yeah.
Yeah,

4384
03:29:25,080 --> 03:29:27,040
I know.
So we basically,

4385
03:29:27,041 --> 03:29:30,010
you can throw on not just one day,
I know,

4386
03:29:30,040 --> 03:29:30,873
but you can throw on 10 pounds 
essentially to what we weighed in it as 

4387
03:29:34,721 --> 03:29:35,820
our real weight,
you know?

4388
03:29:37,750 --> 03:29:38,583
Oh my God,
this is fucking crazy thing we did last 

4389
03:29:43,300 --> 03:29:45,850
year or the year before with this 
challenge.

4390
03:29:45,851 --> 03:29:49,960
And with this one we didn't really take 
into account our own personal health.

4391
03:29:50,200 --> 03:29:51,100
Yeah,
good point.

4392
03:29:51,130 --> 03:29:53,260
That's to do it.
But he really honest.

4393
03:29:53,261 --> 03:29:58,180
I had phantom pains and my kidneys.
I was worried on this one.

4394
03:29:58,250 --> 03:29:58,480
Yeah.

4395
03:29:58,480 --> 03:30:00,220
Yeah.
The last day,

4396
03:30:00,520 --> 03:30:05,520
the last few days I did like somewhere 
in the range of 535 points.

4397
03:30:06,940 --> 03:30:10,270
You were worried about attaching it.
You're sneaky.

4398
03:30:10,920 --> 03:30:15,050
Sneaky disrespect,
slippery Joseph's back.

4399
03:30:15,580 --> 03:30:16,413
And even if you couldn't take about that
the same way I really thought bird was 

4400
03:30:19,691 --> 03:30:20,524
asked to try to double me.
Same feeling like I can't believe you 

4401
03:30:22,541 --> 03:30:24,550
really thought that care.
You don't understand.

4402
03:30:24,551 --> 03:30:26,290
I don't care if it's a rehab.
It happened.

4403
03:30:26,380 --> 03:30:30,900
I don't care if it's real,
it's just you set it so it made it real.

4404
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:33,310
Even if you don't believe it,
it doesn't matter.

4405
03:30:33,311 --> 03:30:35,860
It doesn't help me to think that you 
don't believe I would love.

4406
03:30:35,861 --> 03:30:40,040
It helps your brain every now and then 
believe it helps me to think that you're

4407
03:30:40,041 --> 03:30:44,690
trying to double my score and I'm Mike.
We're going to the dark lands.

4408
03:30:45,060 --> 03:30:47,990
Yeah,
what going dark Bert Kreischer.

4409
03:30:48,170 --> 03:30:51,710
But to answer your question,
I think that we put on our water.

4410
03:30:51,760 --> 03:30:53,750
I put a.
We put on our water weight and I think I

4411
03:30:53,751 --> 03:30:56,240
only gained a few pounds on top of that.
After October.

4412
03:30:56,241 --> 03:31:00,770
Thirty percent stayed consistent.
That's a lie.

4413
03:31:00,780 --> 03:31:04,850
That's the way you think.
Your 2:16

4414
03:31:04,851 --> 03:31:09,851
right now know what I said was to be 
fair.

4415
03:31:11,541 --> 03:31:12,374
That's what Joe said.
What I said was that we probably gained 

4416
03:31:15,050 --> 03:31:15,883
10 pounds back from the water.
I agree with that to 16 will put me at 

4417
03:31:18,880 --> 03:31:21,620
26.
I said I probably gained a few pounds on

4418
03:31:21,621 --> 03:31:23,330
top of.
I would say right now if everything your

4419
03:31:23,331 --> 03:31:25,970
2:30,
I love you.

4420
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:26,833
You're an awesome person,
but the reason why you pushing back 

4421
03:31:28,911 --> 03:31:32,420
against this as [inaudible] your concern
that it's going to sweep back.

4422
03:31:32,421 --> 03:31:37,421
I knew having gained me telling me 
regardless,

4423
03:31:40,840 --> 03:31:44,300
what's he doing at a beach?
He's gotTa Piss Man.

4424
03:31:44,380 --> 03:31:49,380
Even alone families in the social 
justice warrior,

4425
03:31:52,731 --> 03:31:53,564
Joe Rogan.
He's pissing and wave like this bird 

4426
03:31:57,080 --> 03:31:57,913
comes back.

4427
03:32:00,110 --> 03:32:03,680
Just remember that Greg came in last.
I can't tell.

4428
03:32:04,570 --> 03:32:07,250
You can't.
You can't give people motivation.

4429
03:32:07,520 --> 03:32:09,560
You don't understand.
I don't need it to be real.

4430
03:32:10,190 --> 03:32:10,930
I just.
Oh,

4431
03:32:10,930 --> 03:32:12,680
I heard it.
I decided to.

4432
03:32:13,520 --> 03:32:14,353
I'll just decide it's real that.
So you have to understand that you came 

4433
03:32:20,690 --> 03:32:25,690
and fucking last.
Tell him about Jean for real.

4434
03:32:31,010 --> 03:32:33,260
Shut the fuck up and listen.
I think that Mickey.

4435
03:32:33,410 --> 03:32:34,640
Well Jeanne,
thank you.

4436
03:32:35,390 --> 03:32:36,223
He didn't say anything on to.
I want to say this to the Sandy Kofax 

4437
03:32:38,900 --> 03:32:41,960
Jean.
I want to say Mickey Mantle Jeans.

4438
03:32:42,410 --> 03:32:46,140
Oh my God is real.
Not because of this.

4439
03:32:46,560 --> 03:32:50,150
It's because the mickey mantle gene is 
this crazy son of a bitch.

4440
03:32:50,510 --> 03:32:52,220
Could go out Wednesday,
Thursday,

4441
03:32:52,221 --> 03:32:53,054
Friday,
Saturday night until three in the 

4442
03:32:54,111 --> 03:32:56,600
morning with fucking,
you know,

4443
03:32:56,900 --> 03:32:59,030
a hundred and 80,000
beers.

4444
03:33:00,290 --> 03:33:01,190
Sunday.
He was like,

4445
03:33:01,670 --> 03:33:05,850
let's do a shout out fucking fine.
That's Mickey Mantle.

4446
03:33:05,860 --> 03:33:08,180
Jane true.
Not True.

4447
03:33:08,210 --> 03:33:10,610
This shit.
It's a lot of pis,

4448
03:33:10,760 --> 03:33:11,593
I think he's confused about Piss,
what it tastes like when choke it down 

4449
03:33:15,380 --> 03:33:17,160
and you're going to treat them.
No,

4450
03:33:17,170 --> 03:33:18,940
I'm not drinking.
No,

4451
03:33:18,970 --> 03:33:19,803
but Tom,
you got to get mailed to him and you 

4452
03:33:21,430 --> 03:33:22,263
don't.
And then that's all that we need to 

4453
03:33:22,911 --> 03:33:24,440
know.
Why do we tolerate it at all?

4454
03:33:24,530 --> 03:33:28,610
I did more workouts on you doing the 
same work with less points of you.

4455
03:33:28,760 --> 03:33:30,290
That means that a far more workers from 
you,

4456
03:33:30,440 --> 03:33:32,840
Bro.
He didn't work out at all for 10 years.

4457
03:33:32,841 --> 03:33:33,674
It's hard to fuck with that,
but I do the same workout and then it 

4458
03:33:35,651 --> 03:33:37,260
was after doing the same workout with 
you.

4459
03:33:37,261 --> 03:33:38,130
I was down 50

4460
03:33:38,130 --> 03:33:38,963
points we started with you that we are 
missing is what Tom's saying is that if 

4461
03:33:42,601 --> 03:33:46,100
we all had partied at the same level 
every night and then tried to work out,

4462
03:33:47,080 --> 03:33:48,200
you definitely have that.

4463
03:33:48,330 --> 03:33:49,163
Yup.
To the feeling that I got with a molly 

4464
03:33:51,121 --> 03:33:54,930
kicked in and fucking whatever time 
Wednesday night.

4465
03:33:55,050 --> 03:34:00,050
Halloween night was just like this.
John felt so good.

4466
03:34:01,261 --> 03:34:03,810
It felt super.
Woke up the next morning,

4467
03:34:03,840 --> 03:34:04,673
my ankles hurt when I got out of bed,
my knees were there were all stiff and 

4468
03:34:08,941 --> 03:34:09,774
sore or something going on with one of 
the muscles in my calf and I was just 

4469
03:34:13,341 --> 03:34:14,310
walking.
I take a piss.

4470
03:34:14,311 --> 03:34:15,930
I was like,
what happened?

4471
03:34:16,290 --> 03:34:18,060
What did we do?
I was,

4472
03:34:18,180 --> 03:34:19,013
while I was walking around with my kids 
on Halloween doing the trick or treat 

4473
03:34:22,771 --> 03:34:24,810
and deal,
I was thinking to myself,

4474
03:34:24,811 --> 03:34:27,060
thank God it's over.
Like what did,

4475
03:34:27,220 --> 03:34:29,790
what were we doing?
We all went crazy.

4476
03:34:29,791 --> 03:34:33,340
It was crazy.
I showed up at the comedy cellar and put

4477
03:34:33,341 --> 03:34:35,640
up my shirt on,
did my thing,

4478
03:34:35,820 --> 03:34:36,780
and Liz was like,
what are you doing?

4479
03:34:36,781 --> 03:34:39,870
I was like,
to run here because I'm in this constant

4480
03:34:39,871 --> 03:34:40,704
challenge with my friends.
So I had to run across town to a calm 

4481
03:34:44,170 --> 03:34:46,890
response instead of just wasn't cool.

4482
03:34:47,190 --> 03:34:50,400
Two other people go like,
hey man,

4483
03:34:50,490 --> 03:34:52,170
why are you going to the gym right now?
Twice?

4484
03:34:52,440 --> 03:34:53,670
And didn't go,
oh,

4485
03:34:54,090 --> 03:34:57,090
I kinda liked it and I,
and I know it might be the only one,

4486
03:34:57,091 --> 03:35:00,270
but I liked the that I'm in a fight with
my friends.

4487
03:35:00,630 --> 03:35:04,800
And then going in and people going like,
you got this bird tell.

4488
03:35:05,100 --> 03:35:09,210
Show them you can already.
People knew all you dummies and said you

4489
03:35:09,211 --> 03:35:13,460
got this Bert.
Thank you leslie.

4490
03:35:14,310 --> 03:35:18,240
I was more angry about you people to 
when I was like,

4491
03:35:18,270 --> 03:35:19,103
oh great.
So many people on the last time I let 

4492
03:35:23,011 --> 03:35:26,150
down so many people.
The second to last,

4493
03:35:26,550 --> 03:35:27,960
they're dreamers.
The dreamers.

4494
03:35:28,780 --> 03:35:29,613
The dreamers?
No.

4495
03:35:29,660 --> 03:35:33,600
Or they believe in God.
The one who chose here for you?

4496
03:35:33,690 --> 03:35:34,840
Dude,
I would draw.

4497
03:35:34,850 --> 03:35:37,650
I would jogged down here.
People in their truck.

4498
03:35:38,010 --> 03:35:39,380
We got.
You got this bird?

4499
03:35:39,420 --> 03:35:40,570
No,
I got that job.

4500
03:35:42,650 --> 03:35:44,300
I'm gonna.
Wait,

4501
03:35:44,400 --> 03:35:45,810
hold on one second.
My Buddy Eric,

4502
03:35:45,811 --> 03:35:46,644
who's you can tell you.
I went hiking and Runyon Canyon and two 

4503
03:35:48,421 --> 03:35:49,950
guys were like,
hey man,

4504
03:35:49,951 --> 03:35:51,480
you got this bird?
And I was like,

4505
03:35:51,540 --> 03:35:54,120
I was in.
My head was already over.

4506
03:35:54,121 --> 03:35:55,860
I was like,
the job's already beat me.

4507
03:35:55,861 --> 03:35:57,890
Really bad guys.
What did you think the.

4508
03:35:58,100 --> 03:36:00,670
What was the final,
the final is that you got 11,000

4509
03:36:00,671 --> 03:36:01,810
something.
What?

4510
03:36:02,370 --> 03:36:03,370
You got?
Just over 9,000.

4511
03:36:03,690 --> 03:36:06,400
Ten thousand 16 until I got right up to 
$10,000.

4512
03:36:06,401 --> 03:36:09,970
I was just over a thousand,
basically she had 1100,

4513
03:36:09,971 --> 03:36:10,990
1200,
something like that,

4514
03:36:11,280 --> 03:36:14,020
but it is getting $10,000.
It was another one where it's like,

4515
03:36:14,080 --> 03:36:15,660
let's aim for a line.
Get there.

4516
03:36:16,270 --> 03:36:17,560
That's a good line,
man.

4517
03:36:17,890 --> 03:36:20,670
That's a good line.
Eleven to three.

4518
03:36:21,400 --> 03:36:22,300
Good for you,
man.

4519
03:36:23,080 --> 03:36:25,810
Just to put that respective cigar.
Nine,

4520
03:36:25,811 --> 03:36:26,644
five,
three,

4521
03:36:26,850 --> 03:36:31,840
three workouts amongst of the hardest 
relayed,

4522
03:36:31,841 --> 03:36:35,700
the tiniest percentage of the people 
using these things.

4523
03:36:36,150 --> 03:36:37,300
I don't.
Legit.

4524
03:36:37,301 --> 03:36:39,790
Jim.
Where's our snap fitness in Shawnee,

4525
03:36:39,791 --> 03:36:40,800
Kansas.
Crushing.

4526
03:36:40,810 --> 03:36:41,643
We came in first and third and you beat 
a fitness instructor who's giving class 

4527
03:36:47,680 --> 03:36:49,770
killer?
I don't understand.

4528
03:36:52,390 --> 03:36:54,130
All of us.
Literally lost her.

4529
03:36:54,131 --> 03:36:55,760
Fucking mind.
Lost her mind.

4530
03:36:55,980 --> 03:36:58,930
We went crazy.
Now I like it too.

4531
03:36:59,270 --> 03:37:01,840
We're going to serve next year.
I'm into surfing.

4532
03:37:01,870 --> 03:37:03,400
Listen,
I'm going to die.

4533
03:37:03,460 --> 03:37:06,200
You're all going to die out there and 
what I'm talking about Bro,

4534
03:37:06,520 --> 03:37:11,510
we can all come up with all the stuff 
that keeps your ankle altogether.

4535
03:37:11,550 --> 03:37:13,140
Just everywhere.
Dogs shock,

4536
03:37:13,141 --> 03:37:13,974
shock.
That stuff that keeps your ankle from 

4537
03:37:15,131 --> 03:37:16,960
moving around.
That shit's just give it a break.

4538
03:37:17,170 --> 03:37:18,003
Tiger sharks.
How long are you going to stay on that 

4539
03:37:19,271 --> 03:37:20,170
surfboard?
Nurse?

4540
03:37:20,171 --> 03:37:21,250
Sharks.
How long?

4541
03:37:21,530 --> 03:37:23,590
Shut up to Kelly slater.
How long have you got in?

4542
03:37:23,591 --> 03:37:25,780
Yeah,
Kelly be my coach.

4543
03:37:26,890 --> 03:37:30,920
Kelly's going to pick up my podcast.
Joe,

4544
03:37:30,960 --> 03:37:31,571
Joe,
Joe,

4545
03:37:31,571 --> 03:37:32,404
Joe,

4546
03:37:32,460 --> 03:37:34,630
compassion and let bro.
Don't forget.

4547
03:37:34,660 --> 03:37:36,850
Fuck both of you.
I'm going Brad Gerlach then.

4548
03:37:36,851 --> 03:37:37,361
Fine.
Fuck it.

4549
03:37:37,361 --> 03:37:39,100
Who's that guy is A.
Trust me.

4550
03:37:39,101 --> 03:37:42,550
I'm a big fan of surfers.
I just can't serve at Joel tutor guy and

4551
03:37:42,551 --> 03:37:46,540
that guy,
a jujitsu black belt master surfer.

4552
03:37:46,750 --> 03:37:49,270
I actually think Kelly slater is a 
pussy.

4553
03:37:49,271 --> 03:37:49,730
I don't know.

4554
03:37:49,730 --> 03:37:50,563
Once you lose,
never risen to the top of your 

4555
03:37:55,451 --> 03:37:57,130
potential.
No interest,

4556
03:37:58,890 --> 03:37:59,670
no interest.

4557
03:37:59,670 --> 03:38:01,740
You as a coach,
I'm looking for success.

4558
03:38:01,741 --> 03:38:04,680
Not for what has been.
Oh,

4559
03:38:04,700 --> 03:38:07,830
I'm looking for the top.
If you could help me not.

4560
03:38:07,831 --> 03:38:12,120
This is Kelly slater.
Garbage.

4561
03:38:13,180 --> 03:38:15,600
Don't be wrong.
How dare you?

4562
03:38:15,810 --> 03:38:20,730
He's looking for the wind to join on 
this guy.

4563
03:38:22,590 --> 03:38:23,423
That guy that criticizes the girls.
Wait so that he gets started dating or 

4564
03:38:26,650 --> 03:38:31,650
like gets under.
Her name is Kelly.

4565
03:38:34,340 --> 03:38:37,230
Don't fall for a man.
Don't fall for Indian River County.

4566
03:38:37,231 --> 03:38:40,110
What's up?
Let's hang out by these losers.

4567
03:38:40,150 --> 03:38:41,280
Fuck it.
I'll take your brother.

4568
03:38:41,340 --> 03:38:42,091
Evan.
What's up,

4569
03:38:42,091 --> 03:38:44,670
brother?
If you really had to be honest,

4570
03:38:45,000 --> 03:38:47,850
being scientific about how much time do 
you think?

4571
03:38:48,210 --> 03:38:51,310
How much time do you think you could 
spend on a surf board?

4572
03:38:52,650 --> 03:38:56,720
I got this 31 days in,
in,

4573
03:38:56,780 --> 03:38:57,860
in,
in one day.

4574
03:38:58,600 --> 03:39:01,050
Even amount.
Thirty one days.

4575
03:39:04,820 --> 03:39:05,653
If if I did the math right and I could 
for sure we did a work decision for 

4576
03:39:10,280 --> 03:39:11,220
check.
No offense,

4577
03:39:11,221 --> 03:39:14,640
definitely seven days.
Seven full days,

4578
03:39:14,970 --> 03:39:16,650
full days.
Twenty four hours a day.

4579
03:39:17,180 --> 03:39:20,310
I would take a lot of work to get to 
different places.

4580
03:39:21,950 --> 03:39:23,030
Just so you know what you're talking 
about.

4581
03:39:23,210 --> 03:39:26,780
Six hours and about 15 minutes a day on 
the earth.

4582
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:29,730
I'm wrong.
I'm just glad I'm here to do the math.

4583
03:39:29,760 --> 03:39:31,410
Okay.
What did I say?

4584
03:39:31,411 --> 03:39:32,730
Seven,
seven days.

4585
03:39:32,760 --> 03:39:33,593
Four.

4586
03:39:34,070 --> 03:39:39,070
Four days.
Six hours plus a day?

4587
03:39:41,610 --> 03:39:44,660
Some goddamn accountant.
Logic and six hours?

4588
03:39:44,930 --> 03:39:46,730
Yeah.
Ninety six hours in one month.

4589
03:39:47,160 --> 03:39:47,993
Mm hmm.
About almost four hours a day by the 

4590
03:39:50,751 --> 03:39:52,190
way.
This is what I do is talk shit.

4591
03:39:52,191 --> 03:39:53,024
So like.
But there's no consequences for you 

4592
03:39:55,401 --> 03:39:57,050
talking shit.
Do you feel bad about that?

4593
03:39:59,080 --> 03:40:01,700
I have no problem with him in ways 
buying dinner.

4594
03:40:01,880 --> 03:40:04,070
Okay.
Does it feel weird about dinner?

4595
03:40:05,500 --> 03:40:07,790
I can't believe became a last man.
Oh yeah.

4596
03:40:07,791 --> 03:40:11,760
But that's what I do.
I was so worried about coming in last.

4597
03:40:12,020 --> 03:40:14,720
I came in because you're afraid of 
consequences.

4598
03:40:15,010 --> 03:40:15,843
I'd like to live loud.
That's the difference between all of us 

4599
03:40:17,880 --> 03:40:18,860
is said when,
when,

4600
03:40:18,890 --> 03:40:21,820
when we're in a liquor store in Atlanta 
and kissed her and,

4601
03:40:21,890 --> 03:40:22,723
and,
and print starts playing both you 

4602
03:40:24,141 --> 03:40:24,974
fucking hide in the corner until burt 
makes it big and then one person makes 

4603
03:40:28,911 --> 03:40:29,630
it big.

4604
03:40:29,630 --> 03:40:32,000
We all like to make it big.
We want to start dancing.

4605
03:40:32,010 --> 03:40:35,450
Never liked it because I was forced into
making a big big.

4606
03:40:35,451 --> 03:40:38,180
And you loved it big.
We all loved that big.

4607
03:40:39,180 --> 03:40:40,013
What?
Well,

4608
03:40:40,690 --> 03:40:41,990
when we did the,
when we did the,

4609
03:40:41,991 --> 03:40:42,824
uh,
video when we were all partying in 

4610
03:40:44,660 --> 03:40:47,630
Atlanta and,
and Prince came on to you do that.

4611
03:40:47,631 --> 03:40:49,730
We did that because we were like,
you seem to like this.

4612
03:40:49,731 --> 03:40:51,890
I'll let me join him for like 10 seconds
of dance.

4613
03:40:52,060 --> 03:40:54,500
We have fun.
It's doing you listen.

4614
03:40:54,620 --> 03:40:57,450
I would never need a guideline.
Joint pain.

4615
03:40:58,230 --> 03:41:00,770
You definitely changed the tone.
You really do.

4616
03:41:00,900 --> 03:41:03,650
To change tone changed the party 
atmosphere.

4617
03:41:03,920 --> 03:41:06,020
I like to get loud.
I know that it drives,

4618
03:41:06,021 --> 03:41:06,854
does drive people nuts,
but with my friends I trust it that 

4619
03:41:11,750 --> 03:41:13,060
it'll be fun.
No one's going to.

4620
03:41:13,180 --> 03:41:14,013
I don't.
There's no mean spiritedness in it for 

4621
03:41:16,071 --> 03:41:17,360
sure.
One hundred percent.

4622
03:41:17,660 --> 03:41:21,280
I wanted that belt so fucking bad.
Oh,

4623
03:41:25,500 --> 03:41:27,320
can I try it on for sure.
For sure.

4624
03:41:27,700 --> 03:41:29,360
You have your coach?
No,

4625
03:41:29,361 --> 03:41:30,194
I don't want your coach billy.
Billy brought other girl or a Kelly 

4626
03:41:35,720 --> 03:41:36,553
running coach.

4627
03:41:38,600 --> 03:41:40,970
I wanted that belt.
So bad soda.

4628
03:41:40,971 --> 03:41:44,640
I though unfortunately press a joke.
Sorry.

4629
03:41:46,870 --> 03:41:50,390
So heavy.
She just couldn't keep up.

4630
03:41:50,391 --> 03:41:51,224
Right.
Do you think there was any point during 

4631
03:41:53,571 --> 03:41:58,490
the month we had a pace that you think 
you could have kept up where he had been

4632
03:41:58,491 --> 03:42:00,050
like,
you know,

4633
03:42:00,051 --> 03:42:04,400
hitting those 500 point day,
like day after day after day.

4634
03:42:06,300 --> 03:42:10,280
It is like what we already had planned 
for the month.

4635
03:42:10,281 --> 03:42:11,410
Right.
You know,

4636
03:42:11,560 --> 03:42:14,300
if you had that,
you had that cruise.

4637
03:42:14,420 --> 03:42:17,900
I had this hunting trip,
which fortunately ended fairly early,

4638
03:42:18,320 --> 03:42:19,153
but if you were just going somewhere,
if you had somewhere that you had to go 

4639
03:42:22,011 --> 03:42:25,670
for 14 days and you couldn't get a 
workout in,

4640
03:42:25,671 --> 03:42:26,504
you are fucked.
If I had just stayed home that whole 

4641
03:42:28,401 --> 03:42:30,920
trip,
it would've been very different contest,

4642
03:42:31,170 --> 03:42:34,020
but I live without my gym.
No,

4643
03:42:34,130 --> 03:42:35,040
I agree.
I agree.

4644
03:42:36,900 --> 03:42:37,800
We all experienced that.

4645
03:42:37,980 --> 03:42:42,870
I'm not using that,
but it's about just saying except that I

4646
03:42:42,871 --> 03:42:45,270
would have loved to have been not on a 
cruise.

4647
03:42:45,690 --> 03:42:47,700
It was because I get seasick working 
out.

4648
03:42:49,320 --> 03:42:53,220
Bobby Kelly as your motivation.
Just Bobby Kelly sometimes.

4649
03:42:53,240 --> 03:42:57,880
I thought he wanted to go by that,
but it's the other way work together.

4650
03:42:57,920 --> 03:42:58,753
Wait,
you guys know you guys did not work out 

4651
03:43:00,060 --> 03:43:05,060
so fast that the calories are not 
working for me and him just smoke cigars

4652
03:43:05,820 --> 03:43:06,653
and that was a hindrance in me is that I
spoke to about scars and so then when I 

4653
03:43:11,821 --> 03:43:14,370
got back to Tampa for like one day to 
work out,

4654
03:43:14,640 --> 03:43:15,473
dude,
I was like,

4655
03:43:15,630 --> 03:43:16,463
I was coughing up bullshit.
I smoke cigars on my way home to the 

4656
03:43:18,391 --> 03:43:19,224
comedy cellar.
Seven nights of those that I was home 

4657
03:43:21,510 --> 03:43:24,420
of,
the 20 I worked out after I came home,

4658
03:43:24,660 --> 03:43:26,820
supposed to change,
went to workout.

4659
03:43:26,850 --> 03:43:28,480
We're different people,
so bs on you.

4660
03:43:29,760 --> 03:43:33,080
He's definitely a different genetic 
makeup than you know.

4661
03:43:33,090 --> 03:43:36,390
Some people are allergic to peanuts.
Yeah,

4662
03:43:36,391 --> 03:43:39,700
that's true.
The Kelly slater did this.

4663
03:43:40,680 --> 03:43:41,730
Conor mcgregor,
Jane,

4664
03:43:41,910 --> 03:43:43,710
we did we.
This is how we did it.

4665
03:43:43,711 --> 03:43:45,480
We did it because we didn't plan on 
doing it.

4666
03:43:45,870 --> 03:43:46,703
We did not plan on doing.
When Tommy pulled up this idea and we 

4667
03:43:48,931 --> 03:43:49,740
were like,
what?

4668
03:43:49,740 --> 03:43:50,700
It's like,
yeah,

4669
03:43:50,701 --> 03:43:54,660
I wear a heart rate monitor and it's a 
fitness app and we're all like,

4670
03:43:54,661 --> 03:43:56,730
okay.
We were just looking for something to do

4671
03:43:56,760 --> 03:43:57,593
some quantifiable.
We started out thinking it was going to 

4672
03:44:00,411 --> 03:44:01,940
be yoga again.
Right.

4673
03:44:01,990 --> 03:44:03,570
I remember that.
It was done.

4674
03:44:03,571 --> 03:44:04,404
I.
It was loved though.

4675
03:44:04,590 --> 03:44:07,170
I would have done it.
It was the fourth and all.

4676
03:44:07,171 --> 03:44:10,290
You guys were mad at me so mad.
It was on the road.

4677
03:44:11,550 --> 03:44:14,010
What the fuck's up with these?
Get punched her in the red zone.

4678
03:44:14,011 --> 03:44:17,570
Are you fucking kidding me?
These fucking guys are so pissed at.

4679
03:44:17,640 --> 03:44:20,670
You were about anybody.
They just attack them like,

4680
03:44:20,700 --> 03:44:21,700
who?
Anybody,

4681
03:44:21,800 --> 03:44:25,820
whoever's Brown,
here's let me be on whoever's plan.

4682
03:44:25,950 --> 03:44:27,950
I didn't read into this stupid shit

4683
03:44:28,020 --> 03:44:28,853
at all,
so when I got the APP and I put the 

4684
03:44:30,661 --> 03:44:31,950
heart rate monitor on,
I'm like,

4685
03:44:32,010 --> 03:44:33,570
well,
we'll just run to the death.

4686
03:44:33,760 --> 03:44:34,593
I was like,
we're just going to run into the 

4687
03:44:35,221 --> 03:44:37,560
nineties as long as I can in the 
nineties

4688
03:44:37,740 --> 03:44:38,573
like,
let's see.

4689
03:44:40,630 --> 03:44:41,463
I thought you were so upset when you 
found out you don't get more points for 

4690
03:44:43,411 --> 03:44:44,910
90.
It didn't make any sense.

4691
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:45,540
I'm like,
you,

4692
03:44:45,540 --> 03:44:50,540
you get as much points for 80 percent of
your Max heart rate because you do.

4693
03:44:50,730 --> 03:44:52,050
Yeah.
That didn't make any sense.

4694
03:44:52,590 --> 03:44:54,900
It shouldn't be quantifiable,
but Tommy nailed it.

4695
03:44:54,901 --> 03:44:55,734
He's like,
that shit would probably be like high 

4696
03:44:57,191 --> 03:44:59,280
highly litigious.
Oh yeah.

4697
03:44:59,610 --> 03:45:01,770
There's some lawyers over at my son that
was like,

4698
03:45:02,430 --> 03:45:05,340
you can't incentivize people to go to 
the danger.

4699
03:45:06,000 --> 03:45:06,970
What's interesting about that,
about

4700
03:45:06,970 --> 03:45:07,803
that though,
and this is actually changed some of my 

4701
03:45:09,791 --> 03:45:10,624
opinions on training because I've never 
done that where I didn't just do a lot 

4702
03:45:14,681 --> 03:45:18,400
of like really go all out.
I did as little,

4703
03:45:18,500 --> 03:45:21,700
even slow down the pace that I run up 
the hills,

4704
03:45:22,000 --> 03:45:25,270
but when I would get on the heavy bag,
when I would do kickboxing,

4705
03:45:25,330 --> 03:45:26,163
I had way more endurance,
like way more endurance and it was 

4706
03:45:29,591 --> 03:45:30,424
interesting.

4707
03:45:30,550 --> 03:45:31,383
I was like,
this is crazy or this is all I haven't 

4708
03:45:33,790 --> 03:45:34,623
been.
I maybe did over the course of the 

4709
03:45:36,400 --> 03:45:39,190
entire month,
maybe 10 kickboxing workouts,

4710
03:45:39,580 --> 03:45:44,200
but by the end of the month the 
kickboxing and has gotten way higher.

4711
03:45:44,430 --> 03:45:45,263
It was all just from running and from 
doing the elliptical machine rowing 

4712
03:45:49,661 --> 03:45:52,840
machine and doing all that other shit.
All that other shit.

4713
03:45:52,841 --> 03:45:54,160
Just it.
You don't.

4714
03:45:54,161 --> 03:45:57,380
It's not as exciting to do,
but if you do it,

4715
03:45:57,381 --> 03:46:01,150
it ramps up everything around running 
hills.

4716
03:46:01,420 --> 03:46:03,190
You know,
you gotta we gotta keep going.

4717
03:46:03,480 --> 03:46:06,130
Do it once or twice a week.
We got to keep going.

4718
03:46:06,310 --> 03:46:09,530
We have to keep going.
Keep looking at it a little bit.

4719
03:46:09,580 --> 03:46:11,410
Yes.
It's so hard to get where we're at.

4720
03:46:11,460 --> 03:46:13,270
We're getting better.
You guys were too,

4721
03:46:13,271 --> 03:46:14,104
right where you started picking like a 
lot of sugar now because it's going to 

4722
03:46:16,211 --> 03:46:17,044
fuck over the conquest,
but here's the thing and we should all 

4723
03:46:20,021 --> 03:46:20,854
talk about this and maybe we should have
a coach come on and talk to us about if 

4724
03:46:24,371 --> 03:46:27,760
we decide to do this again,
what are our nutritional requirements?

4725
03:46:27,761 --> 03:46:30,160
Because I had one workout.
There's 4,000,

4726
03:46:30,161 --> 03:46:31,720
700 calories.

4727
03:46:33,760 --> 03:46:34,593
That's an insane amount of food.
You know what I never got from like 

4728
03:46:37,670 --> 03:46:38,503
nutritionists and people like that.
Workout people like legit workouts you 

4729
03:46:41,351 --> 03:46:42,850
can do.
You know what I mean?

4730
03:46:42,851 --> 03:46:44,470
Not like this is the best thing.
It's like,

4731
03:46:44,471 --> 03:46:45,041
all right,
right,

4732
03:46:45,041 --> 03:46:47,620
but for my real life,
I'm going to do it twice a week.

4733
03:46:47,860 --> 03:46:48,693
What can I really do and what do I got 
to eat a little bit more often that 

4734
03:46:51,791 --> 03:46:54,250
would help me instead of like an all 
this diet.

4735
03:46:54,320 --> 03:46:56,620
We all talked about this as 
unsustainable.

4736
03:46:56,820 --> 03:46:57,653
Totally level was my joint,
so that was what if I told you you had 

4737
03:47:03,221 --> 03:47:04,780
to do 11,000
points this month?

4738
03:47:04,900 --> 03:47:06,370
November?
No,

4739
03:47:06,400 --> 03:47:08,110
hold on.
What if I told you I can beat you?

4740
03:47:08,170 --> 03:47:09,490
Do it.
You could do it.

4741
03:47:10,150 --> 03:47:11,320
I could do it.
What time is it?

4742
03:47:11,350 --> 03:47:12,183
What is it?
Where are we at?

4743
03:47:12,990 --> 03:47:14,430
Fucking brave.
Broken.

4744
03:47:14,800 --> 03:47:15,490
Fuck yeah.

4745
03:47:15,490 --> 03:47:18,760
Can get a thousand a day.
You don't think I could do it?

4746
03:47:18,820 --> 03:47:19,653
No,
not from here on out with a a thousand 

4747
03:47:23,440 --> 03:47:26,050
dollars a day.
You get there,

4748
03:47:26,080 --> 03:47:27,670
you suck my Dick.
Fuck you mean it.

4749
03:47:27,760 --> 03:47:30,190
But if you don't get there,
you're like,

4750
03:47:30,191 --> 03:47:31,750
dude,
y'all care at all about Gimme.

4751
03:47:31,751 --> 03:47:32,860
GimMe.
GimMe.

4752
03:47:34,030 --> 03:47:35,170
What?
You can do it now.

4753
03:47:35,171 --> 03:47:37,450
You can do what you did before.
Minus five days.

4754
03:47:37,510 --> 03:47:38,730
Hundred percent.
How about the.

4755
03:47:38,740 --> 03:47:39,880
I took three days off.
No,

4756
03:47:39,881 --> 03:47:42,220
I took four days off.
I took three and another day.

4757
03:47:42,580 --> 03:47:44,900
You don't take it with.
You already did last month.

4758
03:47:44,910 --> 03:47:47,890
Hold on right now.
Let's do that right now.

4759
03:47:48,130 --> 03:47:52,000
We get one day next week because I'm 
going to Europe.

4760
03:47:54,000 --> 03:47:56,060
That's crazy.
Who Do you think you get the most points

4761
03:47:56,061 --> 03:47:56,930
him today?
Wow.

4762
03:47:56,931 --> 03:48:00,340
Who's gotten the most points way?
Probably.

4763
03:48:01,150 --> 03:48:03,490
Nope.
Hardest or second?

4764
03:48:04,940 --> 03:48:07,000
Seven hundred 40.
Oh yeah.

4765
03:48:07,240 --> 03:48:08,073
Tom,
do you think you could've got 260 more 

4766
03:48:12,581 --> 03:48:15,680
points,
but after lose a toenail to reason.

4767
03:48:15,681 --> 03:48:17,230
I stopped,
I gotta be honest with you.

4768
03:48:17,470 --> 03:48:19,660
I don't.
Six 40 something,

4769
03:48:19,750 --> 03:48:20,583
something my gut on a one off.
I didn't ever sit down because I had 

4770
03:48:23,231 --> 03:48:28,190
some days where I definitely did like,
so let's put let's possible

4771
03:48:28,190 --> 03:48:29,023
that I did more than that and here's the
two workout days outside of this shit 

4772
03:48:33,651 --> 03:48:34,640
talking,
which is always fun,

4773
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:36,710
but here's what we should really think 
about.

4774
03:48:36,920 --> 03:48:40,430
We definitely got our all of ourselves 
into a really,

4775
03:48:41,330 --> 03:48:43,340
really good level of fitness,
right?

4776
03:48:43,400 --> 03:48:45,320
I mean,
thinking about the shit we did.

4777
03:48:45,470 --> 03:48:46,303
You ran 12 miles,
you ran 15 miles and then you rode five 

4778
03:48:49,881 --> 03:48:51,020
kilometers.
You,

4779
03:48:51,070 --> 03:48:54,380
you ran a shitload.
You got 700 fucking points in a day.

4780
03:48:54,530 --> 03:48:57,650
We went crazy boys.
We went crazy.

4781
03:48:57,830 --> 03:48:59,000
We went crazy.
We,

4782
03:48:59,070 --> 03:49:04,070
we achieved some very bizarre level of 
performance over the month in comparison

4783
03:49:05,271 --> 03:49:07,670
to the average person that wears these 
things.

4784
03:49:07,880 --> 03:49:09,590
It's very weird.
Yeah.

4785
03:49:09,591 --> 03:49:10,424
Okay.
So it's not that we should pat each 

4786
03:49:11,391 --> 03:49:12,770
other on the back,
but it is.

4787
03:49:12,830 --> 03:49:15,260
We should look at what we did and go,
what happened?

4788
03:49:15,780 --> 03:49:17,320
That was possible.
Like Thompson.

4789
03:49:17,380 --> 03:49:18,410
It is possible.

4790
03:49:18,410 --> 03:49:19,880
So let's stop and think about that for a
second.

4791
03:49:20,040 --> 03:49:22,490
It is possible.
Here's the other thing.

4792
03:49:22,670 --> 03:49:25,950
It happened and I feel great.
Feel good.

4793
03:49:27,060 --> 03:49:29,720
I look in the mirror and I'm like,
I like that dude.

4794
03:49:29,721 --> 03:49:34,721
When you were doing the rowing machine 
and I was getting video naked on stage.

4795
03:49:37,150 --> 03:49:37,983
It's exactly his and his dick has 
literally a hundred percent outreach 

4796
03:49:42,891 --> 03:49:45,220
from his pubis.
Tom and I,

4797
03:49:45,230 --> 03:49:48,980
but Bush standing,
I thought I really thought I was like,

4798
03:49:48,981 --> 03:49:49,814
this is a movie montage.
When I watched his fucking perfect 

4799
03:49:54,680 --> 03:49:57,050
position of Ari's like I got to change 
my life.

4800
03:49:57,051 --> 03:50:00,050
I'm going for it.
Like he's really buying into it.

4801
03:50:00,051 --> 03:50:02,740
I was like,
he was changing his life going forward.

4802
03:50:02,760 --> 03:50:03,593
We've got pockets of like kind of work 
out of your fucking super gym for an 

4803
03:50:06,580 --> 03:50:09,790
hour or two because I got to look at it 
in.

4804
03:50:09,930 --> 03:50:12,110
It's a perfect because apps look at 
those abs.

4805
03:50:12,170 --> 03:50:13,940
It's a perfect pull.
The ABS,

4806
03:50:14,680 --> 03:50:15,513
they never looked at it as much as they 
got fucking yellow Sun after the surf 

4807
03:50:20,811 --> 03:50:22,520
camp,
after Chemo Surf Camp,

4808
03:50:23,650 --> 03:50:26,060
we're going to beat them so bad.
I can't go on a surf camp.

4809
03:50:26,061 --> 03:50:26,894
The is.
We don't do anything until October 

4810
03:50:28,281 --> 03:50:30,230
first.
Me and Tom versus jewelry.

4811
03:50:30,520 --> 03:50:31,490
Damn,
I liked that body.

4812
03:50:31,491 --> 03:50:35,510
Look at that fucker checked.
You still jacked nipples,

4813
03:50:35,540 --> 03:50:38,010
but total pounds on Mexican food.
That's it.

4814
03:50:41,090 --> 03:50:42,080
Deal,
Bro.

4815
03:50:42,300 --> 03:50:45,590
But here's the thing,
it's not the thing,

4816
03:50:45,591 --> 03:50:48,940
but here's a thing.
We pulled it off like we really did.

4817
03:50:49,410 --> 03:50:50,243
Well,
all of us did something you never 

4818
03:50:52,401 --> 03:50:53,234
expected.
It's very few that we did this workout 

4819
03:50:55,650 --> 03:51:00,470
in a gym in Kansas.
You crushed them.

4820
03:51:00,800 --> 03:51:03,680
Here's what's crazy.
If you think about the points,

4821
03:51:04,100 --> 03:51:08,990
four points a minute is like hustling.
You see that tower?

4822
03:51:09,050 --> 03:51:10,290
You're in the tech.
What Sally?

4823
03:51:10,460 --> 03:51:12,830
Did they send you an email of your 
monthly tally?

4824
03:51:13,310 --> 03:51:16,120
All the institute.
No wait,

4825
03:51:16,150 --> 03:51:19,680
I'll say I'll read your mind which will 
give you perspective on your worry about

4826
03:51:19,681 --> 03:51:20,870
it in the middle.
Yeah.

4827
03:51:21,350 --> 03:51:24,030
So hold on,
hold the number of calories you burn.

4828
03:51:24,380 --> 03:51:26,190
Shit.
Oh postrace.

4829
03:51:28,210 --> 03:51:32,450
But what's interesting is we didn't 
anticipate is this.

4830
03:51:32,490 --> 03:51:37,490
I thought it'd be like an hour or so.
So the $3,000

4831
03:51:37,910 --> 03:51:40,440
to happened hundred minute.
So it says for the whole month.

4832
03:51:40,500 --> 03:51:42,420
First of all,
it shows me the whole year leading up to

4833
03:51:42,421 --> 03:51:46,980
October and then it says the 95,
38 meps,

4834
03:51:46,981 --> 03:51:48,210
which is the measurement,
right?

4835
03:51:48,420 --> 03:51:50,940
Yeah.
Three thousand 726 minutes.

4836
03:51:50,941 --> 03:51:52,680
I work.
How many hours is it?

4837
03:51:52,681 --> 03:51:54,810
October.
That's funded by 60.

4838
03:51:55,320 --> 03:51:57,390
What?
Sixty hours.

4839
03:51:57,450 --> 03:51:58,800
Oh my God.
Wait,

4840
03:51:58,801 --> 03:51:59,551
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

4841
03:51:59,551 --> 03:52:00,384
Start over.
I was the day he said he worked out 60 

4842
03:52:02,761 --> 03:52:03,970
average?
Yeah.

4843
03:52:04,020 --> 03:52:06,610
Average effort.
Seventy percent for the whole month.

4844
03:52:06,630 --> 03:52:07,830
Oh,
uh,

4845
03:52:07,920 --> 03:52:10,500
calories burned for the month.
Forty 7,000.

4846
03:52:10,501 --> 03:52:15,501
$800 for an average heart rate was 1:31
bpm.

4847
03:52:15,920 --> 03:52:16,753
Wait,
I'm going to send you this because I 

4848
03:52:17,871 --> 03:52:19,890
said to these guys are ready about what?
Pussies.

4849
03:52:19,891 --> 03:52:22,620
We are [inaudible].
There was a guy who went.

4850
03:52:22,830 --> 03:52:26,010
He swam around the UK.
That dude?

4851
03:52:26,480 --> 03:52:29,730
Yeah,
like pull that up.

4852
03:52:30,180 --> 03:52:34,830
This guy to fuck around the UK.
Wow.

4853
03:52:35,310 --> 03:52:39,240
He swam.
He burnt a half a million calories.

4854
03:52:40,380 --> 03:52:42,750
This guy's crazy.
His tongue was falling apart.

4855
03:52:42,880 --> 03:52:46,920
I was reading that yet with the salt 
water in your mouth.

4856
03:52:46,940 --> 03:52:51,110
Oh my God.
His fucking tongue was falling apart and

4857
03:52:51,150 --> 03:52:56,150
this guy swam around the UK.
Hundred and 57 days swimming.

4858
03:52:56,700 --> 03:52:57,533
Twelve hours a day.
We're going to will be on the Rogan 

4859
03:53:00,451 --> 03:53:04,140
podcasts in two weeks.
He can't talk son.

4860
03:53:04,170 --> 03:53:07,230
He did good man.
His ticket got eight and barn roles.

4861
03:53:07,540 --> 03:53:09,840
Yeah.
What Bert worked out.

4862
03:53:09,870 --> 03:53:13,170
This is birth recap.
He did 4,098

4863
03:53:13,171 --> 03:53:15,960
minutes of working out 66 percent 
effort.

4864
03:53:15,961 --> 03:53:19,230
Burned 46,250
calories.

4865
03:53:19,260 --> 03:53:20,670
Average heart rate.
One hundred 20.

4866
03:53:21,240 --> 03:53:23,930
You know it's brutal.
Man is hard.

4867
03:53:24,020 --> 03:53:24,853
Jesus weightlifting workout didn't keep 
any so that that muscle expenditure is 

4868
03:53:32,791 --> 03:53:37,350
like way more severe to direct myself 
for 45 points.

4869
03:53:37,351 --> 03:53:38,850
One day I was like,
oh,

4870
03:53:39,590 --> 03:53:40,170
it was.

4871
03:53:40,170 --> 03:53:41,003
It was different to when you got into 
running like legit running because I 

4872
03:53:44,220 --> 03:53:47,490
would run 10 miles at night and I would 
only get 200 points for it.

4873
03:53:47,980 --> 03:53:50,550
Do that.
I just get up in the middle of the night

4874
03:53:51,510 --> 03:53:52,710
points.
I know.

4875
03:53:52,711 --> 03:53:54,690
Yeah,
because my heart rate wouldn't get over.

4876
03:53:54,960 --> 03:53:55,793
One 30.
Thank God for 24 hour germs or your own 

4877
03:53:58,591 --> 03:54:00,270
weight lifts and kill it.
You were killing it.

4878
03:54:00,280 --> 03:54:01,113
There's 24 hour gyms are interesting 
because you're dealing with psychos and 

4879
03:54:03,871 --> 03:54:04,704
like every,
every piece of equipment you get or if 

4880
03:54:08,611 --> 03:54:09,444
you have your own place,
obviously every time is your own place 

4881
03:54:11,460 --> 03:54:16,050
or maybe it was kimberly trebek run into
some person's working out at 3:00

4882
03:54:16,051 --> 03:54:16,884
in the morning.
It's like a genius could be just can't 

4883
03:54:18,691 --> 03:54:19,524
handle people.
Could be through some moments that he 

4884
03:54:21,541 --> 03:54:24,000
worked at Gold's gym for a while and 
he's just see that the

4885
03:54:24,330 --> 03:54:27,250
difference between 4:00
AM to 6:00

4886
03:54:27,250 --> 03:54:28,083
AM between the tweakers to slowly become
like the winters were getting like a 

4887
03:54:30,680 --> 03:54:32,590
free work workout.
Yeah,

4888
03:54:33,500 --> 03:54:37,300
and it was such a quick shift of like 
type of person coming in.

4889
03:54:37,360 --> 03:54:38,193
Where are we going to dinner?
What do you want to tell people on the 

4890
03:54:40,661 --> 03:54:42,410
Internet?
Oh,

4891
03:54:44,350 --> 03:54:46,420
we wrap the shit up.
Do you want to wrap it up?

4892
03:54:46,750 --> 03:54:51,750
Did we learn anything from this?
Because I find it interesting.

4893
03:54:53,570 --> 03:54:56,500
Let's go around room Tommy buttons.
What did you learn from this?

4894
03:54:57,550 --> 03:54:58,360
I,
I,

4895
03:54:58,360 --> 03:55:03,110
I think I confirmed that I love a 
competitive event.

4896
03:55:05,000 --> 03:55:08,210
It brings me closer to you guys actually
like you guys more.

4897
03:55:08,600 --> 03:55:11,630
Even though I really liked you for,
I'm serious,

4898
03:55:12,160 --> 03:55:14,450
I feel like it makes me like you guys 
more because I'm like,

4899
03:55:14,480 --> 03:55:15,313
oh,
it's Kinda like that comradery of being 

4900
03:55:15,921 --> 03:55:17,810
on a team.
It feels like a team thing.

4901
03:55:18,400 --> 03:55:19,290
Um,
and I,

4902
03:55:19,291 --> 03:55:19,911
I,
yeah,

4903
03:55:19,911 --> 03:55:20,744
I'm,
I'm,

4904
03:55:21,380 --> 03:55:22,590
I had that moment where I'm like,
oh,

4905
03:55:22,591 --> 03:55:25,670
I'm capable of more than I thought I was
capable of.

4906
03:55:25,700 --> 03:55:26,960
Which is a,
like a saying.

4907
03:55:26,961 --> 03:55:29,660
It's encouraging and then it kind of 
fucks with you too.

4908
03:55:30,680 --> 03:55:31,580
Alright.
What did you learn?

4909
03:55:32,120 --> 03:55:36,320
I learned one that I actually am capable
of working out.

4910
03:55:36,380 --> 03:55:39,320
I needed the competition to actually get
to the gym.

4911
03:55:39,440 --> 03:55:41,870
Like I said,
this infant killed January.

4912
03:55:41,880 --> 03:55:44,420
You can.
I hadn't gone there till October.

4913
03:55:46,330 --> 03:55:49,530
I also learned how many people got into 
this.

4914
03:55:49,600 --> 03:55:51,180
It was nuts.
It was a lot.

4915
03:55:51,790 --> 03:55:53,020
I went to a jets game.
People like,

4916
03:55:53,021 --> 03:55:55,030
shouldn't you be working out?
And by the way,

4917
03:55:55,300 --> 03:55:56,133
my favorite spots is in one of these 
things like how sober October going to 

4918
03:55:59,021 --> 03:56:00,490
any family walked by,
I could just go,

4919
03:56:00,670 --> 03:56:01,930
go fuck herself,
eat shit.

4920
03:56:01,931 --> 03:56:03,250
Kill yourself.
That's what you would say.

4921
03:56:03,310 --> 03:56:04,150
Yeah.
All the time.

4922
03:56:04,390 --> 03:56:05,330
Hey you enjoy me?
And silver,

4923
03:56:05,350 --> 03:56:07,120
why don't you go fucking kill yourself 
and your wife.

4924
03:56:07,910 --> 03:56:10,840
It was the best Jesus.
They went perfectly with it.

4925
03:56:11,330 --> 03:56:12,550
I'm like,
fine wine.

4926
03:56:12,720 --> 03:56:13,553
Yeah.
And I realized that actually can work 

4927
03:56:14,891 --> 03:56:18,370
out a little bit and maybe I should work
out a little bit and that's awesome.

4928
03:56:18,371 --> 03:56:19,370
I do it.
I didn't remember it.

4929
03:56:19,371 --> 03:56:22,210
Also on the 30th,
the second last day I was running,

4930
03:56:22,600 --> 03:56:24,010
trying to get.
Just get points.

4931
03:56:24,040 --> 03:56:24,873
Yeah.
And a guy in a construction site was on 

4932
03:56:26,501 --> 03:56:27,334
a cell phone and he did not look like 
somebody I would think would say 

4933
03:56:30,491 --> 03:56:32,590
anything to me.
And he's like,

4934
03:56:32,591 --> 03:56:33,700
yeah.
And then he turns.

4935
03:56:33,701 --> 03:56:34,660
He goes,
hey buds,

4936
03:56:34,690 --> 03:56:36,820
I'm pulling back.

4937
03:56:39,490 --> 03:56:42,100
That's great.
So many people knew about it.

4938
03:56:42,101 --> 03:56:45,250
It was fun.
It was fucking my kid's school.

4939
03:56:45,251 --> 03:56:48,910
Dads were coming up to me and so.
And I'm doing sober October to know shit

4940
03:56:48,920 --> 03:56:50,260
at one more day.
One more day.

4941
03:56:50,380 --> 03:56:52,510
Wow.
What did you learn?

4942
03:56:52,511 --> 03:56:54,130
What'd you learn?
What do you feel like you learned?

4943
03:56:55,510 --> 03:56:56,343
The competitive drive was fascinating.
I didn't anticipate getting that crazy 

4944
03:57:00,670 --> 03:57:02,950
because I just didn't.
I thought it was just gonna be us having

4945
03:57:02,951 --> 03:57:05,080
fun.
We'd work out like last year,

4946
03:57:05,560 --> 03:57:09,990
15 yoga classes.
It's not that extraordinary detail.

4947
03:57:10,180 --> 03:57:12,850
The latter for sure.
The latter part of the month,

4948
03:57:12,851 --> 03:57:13,684
right.
We all did together at like the 28th 

4949
03:57:16,050 --> 03:57:16,661
one.
What?

4950
03:57:16,661 --> 03:57:17,494
I learned something last year though,
honestly to carried over this year that 

4951
03:57:20,261 --> 03:57:22,160
I decided to do nine yoga

4952
03:57:22,190 --> 03:57:24,560
classes in a row to finish off my 
session.

4953
03:57:24,590 --> 03:57:29,120
I had like a bunch of weeks,
like a week plus later to go.

4954
03:57:29,260 --> 03:57:31,130
Like if I wanted to make it to the end 
of the month,

4955
03:57:31,230 --> 03:57:32,063
I just want to get the 15 in.
And I started decided to do nine in a 

4956
03:57:34,131 --> 03:57:39,131
row and when I realized somewhere around
like number seven in a row,

4957
03:57:39,680 --> 03:57:40,191
I was like,
oh,

4958
03:57:40,191 --> 03:57:42,500
you can just keep doing it.
What did you think?

4959
03:57:42,501 --> 03:57:44,870
You need time off,
but you don't really need time off.

4960
03:57:45,070 --> 03:57:48,230
He just needed to keep doing it and 
maybe you'll slow down a little bit.

4961
03:57:48,260 --> 03:57:50,480
Maybe you'll you won't have as much 
energy,

4962
03:57:50,630 --> 03:57:54,560
but then you just keep doing it.
Your body will eventually adapt,

4963
03:57:54,590 --> 03:57:56,440
but this is way more demand.
But this is what,

4964
03:57:56,441 --> 03:57:58,040
what,
what happened with this too?

4965
03:57:58,160 --> 03:58:01,070
So what I realized last year by doing 
nine in a row,

4966
03:58:01,190 --> 03:58:02,023
like your body just sort of adapts and 
then once I started doing like us are 

4967
03:58:05,260 --> 03:58:07,670
ramping up the cardio sessions and I was
like,

4968
03:58:07,700 --> 03:58:08,533
okay,
if I just decided to get off now I can 

4969
03:58:10,731 --> 03:58:12,290
get off now.
I can just stop now.

4970
03:58:12,320 --> 03:58:13,400
An hour and a half.
It's a long time.

4971
03:58:13,410 --> 03:58:16,190
You'd be like 300 points.
What's better?

4972
03:58:16,370 --> 03:58:18,860
Five hours is better.
We'll see if we can do five hours.

4973
03:58:19,340 --> 03:58:20,173
Like we did an hour and a half.
We just got to do an hour and a half 

4974
03:58:21,471 --> 03:58:22,910
again.
Then we're almost there.

4975
03:58:23,040 --> 03:58:25,670
Then we're at three and then we do an 
hour and a half again.

4976
03:58:25,671 --> 03:58:27,150
There were four and a half.
Then we're all,

4977
03:58:27,570 --> 03:58:28,750
oh yeah,

4978
03:58:32,800 --> 03:58:36,290
with this is all bad.
This is why psychos like Lance Armstrong

4979
03:58:36,291 --> 03:58:39,560
win the Tour de France.
It's not just because the steroids,

4980
03:58:39,860 --> 03:58:44,860
because he's a fucking psycho mind of a 
werewolf.

4981
03:58:46,140 --> 03:58:50,810
Funding figures out a way to win.
So part of this daily workout right now,

4982
03:58:50,870 --> 03:58:51,703
like whatever lands does today,
fucking blow your fucking mind zones on 

4983
03:58:57,171 --> 03:58:58,004
that guy.
And it's over super hyper competitive 

4984
03:59:00,860 --> 03:59:02,960
mental part of this,
not just to go do it,

4985
03:59:02,961 --> 03:59:04,820
but actually go,
you need to go,

4986
03:59:04,890 --> 03:59:06,800
you need to leave your apartment,
your house,

4987
03:59:06,801 --> 03:59:09,020
and you do go over there.
I know you want to do this,

4988
03:59:09,021 --> 03:59:10,730
but you've got to go do it now for a 
couple of hours.

4989
03:59:10,731 --> 03:59:14,840
That part was like one of the hardest 
parts about anxiety in the morning.

4990
03:59:15,230 --> 03:59:17,270
You would go off and I'd worry.
I'd check.

4991
03:59:17,480 --> 03:59:19,630
Check your scores.
Scores.

4992
03:59:20,030 --> 03:59:21,590
Scores.
The only message.

4993
03:59:22,700 --> 03:59:24,830
What'd you learn?
What'd you Limbert Oh,

4994
03:59:24,920 --> 03:59:25,753
fucking mail.

4995
03:59:26,340 --> 03:59:27,150
No,
I was.

4996
03:59:27,150 --> 03:59:29,450
I was asking you.
But what'd you learn?

4997
03:59:29,451 --> 03:59:32,140
Something?
I learned A.

4998
03:59:32,840 --> 03:59:36,590
I learned that I have a lot more in me 
than I ever thought I had.

4999
03:59:36,930 --> 03:59:37,763
You know,
I learned that already is a sneaky fuck 

5000
03:59:41,220 --> 03:59:43,040
with a lot more strength than I ever 
thought.

5001
03:59:43,041 --> 03:59:45,770
I imagined.
Get angry that they were sandbagging.

5002
03:59:45,771 --> 03:59:47,910
You said I got angry a lot.
Yeah.

5003
03:59:48,950 --> 03:59:52,760
You didn't want anyone to out of the 
same shit you got into.

5004
03:59:52,761 --> 03:59:55,310
I got into two.
But just with you.

5005
03:59:55,311 --> 03:59:57,770
I just thought it was a joke.
I didn't think you were really upset.

5006
03:59:58,750 --> 04:00:03,580
I was scared of you halfway.
You don't understand.

5007
04:00:03,650 --> 04:00:06,920
I didn't think it was real.
I didn't think you really believe you're

5008
04:00:06,950 --> 04:00:09,010
going to double me.
I never thought that was real hard,

5009
04:00:09,080 --> 04:00:11,450
but I didn't.
I didn't have to.

5010
04:00:11,630 --> 04:00:15,110
I heard the words and so I decided to 
believe them.

5011
04:00:15,180 --> 04:00:16,250
Dude,
I used to think,

5012
04:00:16,380 --> 04:00:19,170
believe that you think I was going to 
beat you already know.

5013
04:00:19,171 --> 04:00:20,030
I never knew you

5014
04:00:20,030 --> 04:00:21,870
would be.
You never went.

5015
04:00:21,930 --> 04:00:25,010
I never knew Tom will beat me.
Beat,

5016
04:00:25,110 --> 04:00:26,470
you know,
way.

5017
04:00:26,600 --> 04:00:27,600
Uh,
no,

5018
04:00:27,601 --> 04:00:28,380
not,
not at all.

5019
04:00:28,380 --> 04:00:29,213
I thought you were sort of shape.
I thought it was a misjudgment of the 

5020
04:00:31,211 --> 04:00:32,044
system.
And then when we went on a hike 

5021
04:00:32,521 --> 04:00:33,354
together,
I was like,

5022
04:00:33,660 --> 04:00:35,520
oh fuck.
I was like,

5023
04:00:35,550 --> 04:00:36,383
oh yeah,
of course someone that's 100 pounds 

5024
04:00:38,221 --> 04:00:39,740
lighter than me would be in better 
shape.

5025
04:00:39,760 --> 04:00:40,920
That makes sense.
Thank you.

5026
04:00:40,950 --> 04:00:41,880
Fifty pounds.
But yes.

5027
04:00:41,881 --> 04:00:43,050
Yes.
There's a lot.

5028
04:00:43,051 --> 04:00:44,700
I learned a lot.
I learned.

5029
04:00:44,910 --> 04:00:45,743
What did you learn a lot.
I learned that I number one thing is 

5030
04:00:50,221 --> 04:00:53,160
that I need this comradery to better 
myself.

5031
04:00:53,161 --> 04:00:53,994
Like when you get challenged by your 
friends and you have this fun fuckery 

5032
04:00:57,241 --> 04:00:58,074
that just happens every day.
Fuck it points you into a place that's 

5033
04:01:00,871 --> 04:01:02,430
better for yourself.
My opinion.

5034
04:01:02,520 --> 04:01:03,280
It's also really fun

5035
04:01:03,280 --> 04:01:05,920
fun for people listening.
I got a lot of people that came up to me

5036
04:01:05,921 --> 04:01:06,401
and said,
man,

5037
04:01:06,401 --> 04:01:07,234
I wish I had friends like you guys 
because you guys are so silly and 

5038
04:01:10,151 --> 04:01:11,530
stupid.
You're both.

5039
04:01:11,590 --> 04:01:12,423
You're all of you rather or just like 
goofing on each other constantly and 

5040
04:01:15,611 --> 04:01:17,980
everybody's laughing,
howling and it,

5041
04:01:18,280 --> 04:01:22,450
it gives everybody that's listening to.
This is bizarre sense of comradery.

5042
04:01:22,460 --> 04:01:23,293
Let's get.
We got through this fuck stupid fucking 

5043
04:01:25,780 --> 04:01:30,780
month when we're doing insane amount of 
exercise saying I'm at the end of it.

5044
04:01:32,330 --> 04:01:33,700
We,
we're talking about trying to.

5045
04:01:33,701 --> 04:01:35,050
When I called her one day and I was 
like,

5046
04:01:35,080 --> 04:01:36,610
you know,
we're not athletes,

5047
04:01:36,611 --> 04:01:37,210
right?
Like,

5048
04:01:37,210 --> 04:01:40,680
what was the best?
We're not all trained athletes,

5049
04:01:40,690 --> 04:01:40,990
bro.

5050
04:01:40,990 --> 04:01:41,671
Tell him.
He goes,

5051
04:01:41,671 --> 04:01:43,230
we're just comics.
I went,

5052
04:01:43,460 --> 04:01:44,041
no,
we're not,

5053
04:01:44,041 --> 04:01:44,874
bro.

5054
04:01:45,180 --> 04:01:49,800
Yeah.
That's time competition.

5055
04:01:49,880 --> 04:01:54,270
Would you have in second or third in the
final scores had a killer.

5056
04:01:54,680 --> 04:01:57,450
That's crazy.
J One d,

5057
04:01:57,451 --> 04:01:58,284
One athlete.
Crazy and she probably teaches a gang 

5058
04:02:00,330 --> 04:02:01,163
classes,
but also she probably never gets out of 

5059
04:02:02,761 --> 04:02:07,761
the grange probably in super shape.
She's probably doing it forever.

5060
04:02:08,851 --> 04:02:11,730
She'd probably bury all of us.
That's the thing.

5061
04:02:11,731 --> 04:02:16,140
It's like what we did was we just did a 
one month chaos run.

5062
04:02:18,000 --> 04:02:18,833
We all survived,
but I think we should be careful about 

5063
04:02:20,371 --> 04:02:21,204
this because there is,
there is really a potential damage your 

5064
04:02:24,001 --> 04:02:26,910
body doing stuff like this.
It's really fun for sure.

5065
04:02:26,970 --> 04:02:27,803
But there's a weird potential for like 
when you hear about stuff like Rhabdo 

5066
04:02:30,451 --> 04:02:31,170
and you're like,
what?

5067
04:02:31,170 --> 04:02:32,003
What happened to tell you about for the 
positive is so much outweighs the 

5068
04:02:35,701 --> 04:02:37,200
potential for the negative that it's 
like,

5069
04:02:37,201 --> 04:02:38,034
just do it.
I'm not saying that this is one of the 

5070
04:02:39,001 --> 04:02:41,610
big negatives,
but I don't know how any of you guys did

5071
04:02:41,611 --> 04:02:43,320
with cramps.
I had um,

5072
04:02:43,650 --> 04:02:48,180
unbelievable muscle cramps,
the last plan for that.

5073
04:02:48,210 --> 04:02:49,760
So I took a lot.
Yeah,

5074
04:02:49,761 --> 04:02:50,594
yeah.
I totally.

5075
04:02:51,020 --> 04:02:54,090
A lot of electrolytes.
I took more than I needed.

5076
04:02:54,091 --> 04:02:58,710
I took them with him.
I added Himalayan salt and water and one

5077
04:02:58,711 --> 04:03:02,400
of the things that I realized when you 
add too much Himalayan salt to water,

5078
04:03:02,520 --> 04:03:03,353
your body processes it like food,
so all that water comes right through 

5079
04:03:08,220 --> 04:03:11,490
your butthole,
like a runaway train,

5080
04:03:12,100 --> 04:03:17,100
like a semi with broken just shit and 
water

5081
04:03:17,980 --> 04:03:22,570
up gets 34 ounces of water coming flying
out of your asshole at mach one.

5082
04:03:22,780 --> 04:03:24,070
It's crazy,
dude.

5083
04:03:24,071 --> 04:03:27,070
Your body,
when you drink salt with water together,

5084
04:03:27,220 --> 04:03:28,001
your body goes,
oh,

5085
04:03:28,001 --> 04:03:29,980
this is food.
What is this?

5086
04:03:29,981 --> 04:03:32,290
We get it Outta here.
Get it out.

5087
04:03:32,650 --> 04:03:33,483
Woo comes out like water.
My ass was blown out for a lot of those 

5088
04:03:38,231 --> 04:03:39,064
workouts.
It was hard because the amount of time 

5089
04:03:41,831 --> 04:03:43,750
that all of us,
we're pumping our legs.

5090
04:03:43,751 --> 04:03:45,580
It's crazy.
She's Christ.

5091
04:03:45,610 --> 04:03:47,020
That's it.
Make any sense.

5092
04:03:47,021 --> 04:03:49,420
It's just the fact that we got close to 
each other.

5093
04:03:49,690 --> 04:03:52,040
We'll all of us were preposterous.
Burt,

5094
04:03:52,130 --> 04:03:57,130
you were.
You were all of us for postrace in terms

5095
04:03:58,391 --> 04:04:01,780
of a normal month of exercise for sure.
Basically everybody,

5096
04:04:01,930 --> 04:04:06,250
it's more than I ever seen one of those.
I'm one of those boards for 10 months.

5097
04:04:06,790 --> 04:04:07,623
I've never seen anything.
I knew that was the 11 five digits 

5098
04:04:10,500 --> 04:04:13,840
getting 11,700,
7,000

5099
04:04:13,850 --> 04:04:15,610
and that,
that was pretty nuts.

5100
04:04:15,640 --> 04:04:17,890
11,000
is taking to a terrible,

5101
04:04:19,750 --> 04:04:22,540
terrible place to get to $11,000.
It doesn't.

5102
04:04:22,810 --> 04:04:26,710
It was only because we were all sort of 
pushing each other where it's like,

5103
04:04:28,730 --> 04:04:29,690
oh fuck,
he's doing.

5104
04:04:29,790 --> 04:04:32,890
We want to lose.
To be honest with him,

5105
04:04:32,891 --> 04:04:35,500
he's right here.
600 something.

5106
04:04:35,501 --> 04:04:37,960
It was like fuck.
But there was also like,

5107
04:04:38,020 --> 04:04:38,853
wait,
I could do at least that one day I got 

5108
04:04:40,571 --> 04:04:45,550
one more day in me of that show is beat.
Bert and Tom,

5109
04:04:45,551 --> 04:04:46,900
tell me what you and I talked about.

5110
04:04:47,490 --> 04:04:49,950
I was telling him on the 31st I was 
like,

5111
04:04:49,980 --> 04:04:52,200
fuck,
I got this.

5112
04:04:52,201 --> 04:04:54,240
I just,
I just flew to Tampa.

5113
04:04:54,460 --> 04:04:56,190
I go,
I got the next day and I.

5114
04:04:56,400 --> 04:04:57,233
So I,
I didn't even tell you guys I didn't 

5115
04:04:58,171 --> 04:04:59,670
know how it's going to effect.
So I was like,

5116
04:05:00,390 --> 04:05:03,000
alright,
can we had a cutoff of 10 eastern?

5117
04:05:03,430 --> 04:05:05,130
I just got to the hotel.
I checked in,

5118
04:05:05,131 --> 04:05:07,680
I go right to the gym and I was like,
man,

5119
04:05:08,070 --> 04:05:12,900
this has been a fucking motherfucker.
And I got to work out right now.

5120
04:05:13,530 --> 04:05:15,570
I didn't know how.
I knew you were six,

5121
04:05:15,571 --> 04:05:18,450
700 points ahead of me.
I just started and I was like,

5122
04:05:18,480 --> 04:05:20,970
I just,
I can't lose the bird.

5123
04:05:20,971 --> 04:05:23,100
Right?
I was like,

5124
04:05:23,110 --> 04:05:24,250
I can't,
I can't.

5125
04:05:24,690 --> 04:05:26,960
And I had major anxiety.
I didn't think like,

5126
04:05:27,010 --> 04:05:28,170
oh,
it would suck to lose the bird.

5127
04:05:28,410 --> 04:05:31,980
I had like crippling anxiety about it 
and I was like,

5128
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:32,833
all right.
I just kept going and I had a few 

5129
04:05:34,770 --> 04:05:35,603
hundred points.
I was already at least I didn't know if 

5130
04:05:37,531 --> 04:05:39,800
you'd sinked up.
So I was at least 307.

5131
04:05:40,770 --> 04:05:42,890
Oh,
sick was a real worry.

5132
04:05:42,950 --> 04:05:43,783
Yeah.
Seeking was a real way to make rules if 

5133
04:05:45,381 --> 04:05:47,900
we do this ever again.
First of all,

5134
04:05:48,380 --> 04:05:49,213
we got to get blood checked.
Why is a real concern if we doing drugs 

5135
04:05:55,341 --> 04:05:55,930
or alcohol,
you mean?

5136
04:05:55,930 --> 04:05:56,250
No,
no,

5137
04:05:56,250 --> 04:05:56,571
no,
no,

5138
04:05:56,571 --> 04:05:56,901
no,
no,

5139
04:05:56,901 --> 04:05:58,190
no.
I mean rob doe.

5140
04:05:58,420 --> 04:06:00,010
I mean people die.
Oh,

5141
04:06:01,690 --> 04:06:05,210
it'd be cool to do this with doctors if 
we ever do anything like this again.

5142
04:06:05,240 --> 04:06:06,073
I really think we should do it with 
doctors because there was a point where 

5143
04:06:08,541 --> 04:06:11,840
I said like at the end there I was,
I was having like phantom pains.

5144
04:06:14,490 --> 04:06:17,390
It just just felt 31st was a bad day for
me.

5145
04:06:17,450 --> 04:06:20,060
That travel day.
That was what you call Joe?

5146
04:06:20,400 --> 04:06:20,661
No,
no,

5147
04:06:20,661 --> 04:06:22,870
no.
I called to talk to him first.

5148
04:06:22,960 --> 04:06:27,800
He Jealous First.
I worked out in the morning.

5149
04:06:27,801 --> 04:06:29,990
Mother fucker.
I worked out in the morning.

5150
04:06:30,080 --> 04:06:32,940
By the way.
You talk to everyone in here bumped me.

5151
04:06:33,020 --> 04:06:34,610
I talked to you.
You just don't call me.

5152
04:06:34,700 --> 04:06:36,200
Oh,
you fucking liar.

5153
04:06:36,440 --> 04:06:39,000
I worked out in the morning,
flew to Tampa.

5154
04:06:39,140 --> 04:06:43,340
I'm 31st landed,
went to the fucking gym.

5155
04:06:43,610 --> 04:06:48,440
I actually talked to you and then you 
and then an hour after you.

5156
04:06:49,040 --> 04:06:49,873
I spoke to him and I was like,
I see that he started 300 ahead of them 

5157
04:06:53,360 --> 04:06:54,193
now.
Two,

5158
04:06:54,770 --> 04:06:56,780
$300.
If you don't work out,

5159
04:06:56,900 --> 04:07:01,900
he can catch you on 200 more,
which makes 500,

5160
04:07:02,430 --> 04:07:04,730
least 500 at least that I can see.
Yeah.

5161
04:07:04,740 --> 04:07:07,430
Which is two and a half hours and I 
tried to know and I was like,

5162
04:07:07,431 --> 04:07:08,960
what's up?
And I really believed them.

5163
04:07:08,961 --> 04:07:10,580
I was like,
I hear him.

5164
04:07:10,581 --> 04:07:12,290
He was like chopping.
He's like,

5165
04:07:12,291 --> 04:07:14,660
I'm cooking right now at the house.
Friends are over,

5166
04:07:14,661 --> 04:07:15,494
blah blah,
blah.

5167
04:07:15,680 --> 04:07:16,970
He's like,
I swear I'm done.

5168
04:07:17,030 --> 04:07:18,350
And I was like,
all right man.

5169
04:07:18,530 --> 04:07:22,960
And I hung up and I was like,
I got to go for at least another room.

5170
04:07:23,000 --> 04:07:24,200
I said to you,
I said,

5171
04:07:24,230 --> 04:07:27,080
I know where my children have done.
I go,

5172
04:07:27,081 --> 04:07:28,160
when I say I'm done,
I'm done.

5173
04:07:28,650 --> 04:07:31,170
I'm done.
And I go,

5174
04:07:31,430 --> 04:07:32,263
we got friends over.
I had to go spend the day with Georgia 

5175
04:07:33,781 --> 04:07:36,070
with her thing.
I don't have time to workout and I'm not

5176
04:07:36,071 --> 04:07:39,090
going to do it now I'm ready to get 
fucked up at midnight.

5177
04:07:39,150 --> 04:07:39,983
Well,
what I knew to was that I was not going 

5178
04:07:41,481 --> 04:07:46,481
to go another 500 to cash.
Payments are going to go.

5179
04:07:47,340 --> 04:07:50,040
Can you please just tell me so I can 
actually take this dancing when I'm on.

5180
04:07:50,160 --> 04:07:50,993
You know what I'm fucking out of it.
Part of it was very nice when Georgia 

5181
04:07:55,160 --> 04:07:56,970
power.
I got back from spin class,

5182
04:07:57,290 --> 04:07:58,200
Georgia was at school,

5183
04:07:58,250 --> 04:07:59,330
texted me,
she goes,

5184
04:07:59,331 --> 04:08:03,180
uh hey,
I need you to do the daddy lunch in,

5185
04:08:03,181 --> 04:08:05,840
set up at nine,
and it was like 8:00

5186
04:08:06,410 --> 04:08:08,330
and I looked at Leanna was like,
I'm done.

5187
04:08:08,590 --> 04:08:09,420
I don't,
I can't.

5188
04:08:09,420 --> 04:08:10,940
I got really angry.
She was,

5189
04:08:10,941 --> 04:08:12,080
honey,
he lost,

5190
04:08:12,110 --> 04:08:13,010
you're working.
She goes,

5191
04:08:13,011 --> 04:08:14,300
he lost.
He lost that.

5192
04:08:14,301 --> 04:08:16,260
Go of it to hours.
So competitive.

5193
04:08:16,270 --> 04:08:17,810
I was so competitive about it and I 
went,

5194
04:08:18,380 --> 04:08:19,840
I,
I give it really hard today.

5195
04:08:19,850 --> 04:08:20,960
I can definitely,
she goes,

5196
04:08:21,170 --> 04:08:23,570
just like have it be a dad and I,
I couldn't.

5197
04:08:23,610 --> 04:08:24,443
I had to go lay in bed and just go like,
I'm gonna give myself 15 minutes to lay 

5198
04:08:28,341 --> 04:08:29,810
in bed and get my head straight.

5199
04:08:30,160 --> 04:08:30,993
Well maybe we should consider this.
Maybe we should think that this 

5200
04:08:32,711 --> 04:08:37,310
competition is more of a time constraint
issue in like how much time you have,

5201
04:08:37,670 --> 04:08:40,300
how much time you have is a lot of.
It's not just being able to do it,

5202
04:08:40,301 --> 04:08:42,330
but it's like making time for it.
Right?

5203
04:08:42,810 --> 04:08:43,611
Yeah,
it was,

5204
04:08:43,611 --> 04:08:46,630
it was super hard at times because you 
were social functions where you're like,

5205
04:08:46,631 --> 04:08:48,850
I want to be able to do this.
My friends right now.

5206
04:08:48,910 --> 04:08:50,800
Yeah.
I can't go with working out.

5207
04:08:51,170 --> 04:08:51,750
Yeah,

5208
04:08:51,750 --> 04:08:55,770
that doesn't matter because I know Joe's
got two young kids and I would go,

5209
04:08:55,880 --> 04:08:57,000
he's right in there.
Five hours.

5210
04:08:57,060 --> 04:08:57,893
I go,
fuck it.

5211
04:08:58,590 --> 04:09:01,170
I would make amendments.
That's everyday genius.

5212
04:09:01,200 --> 04:09:02,033
I booked my podcast whenever one.
What I did was I just scheduled a time 

5213
04:09:04,891 --> 04:09:08,760
where I could work out for at least four
hours before I had to be at the podcast.

5214
04:09:08,820 --> 04:09:12,750
She come in here and do it till 20 
minutes before shower and get ready.

5215
04:09:12,900 --> 04:09:14,190
Sure.
So if a noon

5216
04:09:14,200 --> 04:09:15,033
podcast,
Mike,

5217
04:09:15,410 --> 04:09:17,250
you know,
the kids get up early,

5218
04:09:17,251 --> 04:09:20,130
I'm out of the house at seven,
seven.

5219
04:09:20,131 --> 04:09:23,740
I'm coming to the gym or I'm going to,
you know,

5220
04:09:24,120 --> 04:09:26,730
work out in my yard or I'm going to run 
the hills.

5221
04:09:26,760 --> 04:09:28,760
A lot of run the hills a lot.
I want to run those.

5222
04:09:28,900 --> 04:09:30,160
The your daughter mom,
man.

5223
04:09:30,840 --> 04:09:31,673
Fun.
I got a few different routes that I go 

5224
04:09:34,110 --> 04:09:34,590
to.
Mix it.

5225
04:09:34,590 --> 04:09:34,951
Yeah.
Yeah.

5226
04:09:34,951 --> 04:09:35,784
Some are more steep.
One of them is way more severe in the 

5227
04:09:37,501 --> 04:09:40,470
beginning,
one of them starts out with a real heavy

5228
04:09:40,471 --> 04:09:41,850
pitch.
It's like real steep,

5229
04:09:41,851 --> 04:09:42,684
steep,
steep beginning and then it gets harder 

5230
04:09:44,611 --> 04:09:45,860
and harder than the end of it.
You're,

5231
04:09:45,861 --> 04:09:49,230
you're running more of a downward slope 
down.

5232
04:09:49,231 --> 04:09:51,350
So yeah,
it's,

5233
04:09:51,470 --> 04:09:52,500
it's hard,
man.

5234
04:09:52,650 --> 04:09:55,560
There's something about running hills 
that I really think it's like,

5235
04:09:55,910 --> 04:09:57,780
it's,
it's a survival thing.

5236
04:09:58,140 --> 04:10:00,120
It's like if you want to get away,
what are you going to do?

5237
04:10:00,170 --> 04:10:01,003
You gotta run,
you gotta get your body after you can't 

5238
04:10:03,110 --> 04:10:05,400
get your body out of there.
You got to survive,

5239
04:10:05,410 --> 04:10:08,190
motherfucker.
It's a scary thing running those hills.

5240
04:10:08,220 --> 04:10:08,590
Sure.

5241
04:10:08,590 --> 04:10:09,423
Ron.

5242
04:10:10,220 --> 04:10:11,450
Hey,
do you have a place,

5243
04:10:11,470 --> 04:10:16,470
uh,
that you could pretty hammered?

5244
04:10:16,780 --> 04:10:18,080
No,
I'm just saying run,

5245
04:10:18,081 --> 04:10:19,100
run.
Sorry.

5246
04:10:19,850 --> 04:10:20,870
I've placed.
We can.

5247
04:10:20,871 --> 04:10:22,040
What?
By Elk?

5248
04:10:22,520 --> 04:10:23,500
I give you some,
you know.

5249
04:10:23,510 --> 04:10:23,811
No,
no,

5250
04:10:23,811 --> 04:10:24,350
no,
no.

5251
04:10:24,350 --> 04:10:25,460
I got a lot of it.
I know.

5252
04:10:25,470 --> 04:10:28,850
I know.
I felt like I was this whole time,

5253
04:10:28,851 --> 04:10:29,684
this whole month,
this whole month I would look at your 

5254
04:10:31,281 --> 04:10:34,370
meals and I go,
I want to start eating melt elk.

5255
04:10:34,420 --> 04:10:35,390
Okay.
But no,

5256
04:10:35,440 --> 04:10:35,751
no,
no.

5257
04:10:35,751 --> 04:10:36,584
But I meant like I in like,
is there a place that someone listening 

5258
04:10:38,601 --> 04:10:40,950
right now can go by?
You can't find a place to buy it?

5259
04:10:40,990 --> 04:10:43,760
No.
You can buy some of it from New Zealand.

5260
04:10:44,070 --> 04:10:44,903
They'll sell it from New Zealand.
But you can't buy North American game 

5261
04:10:48,531 --> 04:10:50,660
animals in North America.
They can't.

5262
04:10:50,940 --> 04:10:53,300
That I couldn't find it for.
Saved my life.

5263
04:10:53,330 --> 04:10:54,163
Yeah.
That's because it's not for sale 

5264
04:10:54,801 --> 04:10:57,260
commercially.
They raise it in.

5265
04:10:58,850 --> 04:11:00,800
What's up?
Hey,

5266
04:11:01,980 --> 04:11:03,480
what's up?
Let's go.

5267
04:11:03,481 --> 04:11:05,010
Let's go.
We're going to go have dinner.

5268
04:11:05,370 --> 04:11:07,350
They raised them in New Zealand in 
particular.

5269
04:11:07,720 --> 04:11:08,553
You know,
New Zealand has a giant collection of 

5270
04:11:10,891 --> 04:11:13,650
uh,
I forgot this one thing sober October.

5271
04:11:14,060 --> 04:11:14,893
It's that thing you've said before.
I thought about it a couple times 

5272
04:11:17,281 --> 04:11:18,091
throughout the month.
The,

5273
04:11:18,091 --> 04:11:18,660
uh,
the,

5274
04:11:18,660 --> 04:11:20,100
the,
your inner bitch thing.

5275
04:11:20,160 --> 04:11:23,940
Conquer your inner bitch.
We talk about quit that day to quit.

5276
04:11:23,950 --> 04:11:25,620
But everyday.
Here's the thing.

5277
04:11:25,680 --> 04:11:29,150
I didn't even consider an inner critic 
voice everyday.

5278
04:11:29,220 --> 04:11:30,053
I was like,
these,

5279
04:11:30,150 --> 04:11:32,550
these three fucking cock suckers are 
doing.

5280
04:11:33,360 --> 04:11:36,670
So I definitely have.
And I was doing a lot of,

5281
04:11:37,220 --> 04:11:39,240
a lot of the month.
I was doing two a days.

5282
04:11:39,300 --> 04:11:40,133
Yeah,
me too.

5283
04:11:40,440 --> 04:11:42,010
It's crazy.
Crazy.

5284
04:11:42,020 --> 04:11:43,890
I know.
So I'm saying like that's.

5285
04:11:44,430 --> 04:11:47,670
That was one of those things,
but it's funny when you have,

5286
04:11:47,671 --> 04:11:50,610
but it's interesting to me was like when
you have friends involved,

5287
04:11:51,290 --> 04:11:53,790
dude,
the consideration of even let's just lay

5288
04:11:53,791 --> 04:11:56,340
here and chill wasn't even a 
consideration.

5289
04:11:57,780 --> 04:12:02,070
Just seeing Bert with that strap on 
talked and he was like,

5290
04:12:02,071 --> 04:12:07,071
whatever it joe scream into the night 
bird.

5291
04:12:08,460 --> 04:12:11,980
I want to get it bothered with cab.
I want a Pinot noir.

5292
04:12:12,190 --> 04:12:13,023
Let's get like bone in rib eyes.
We're going to do it up tonight as 

5293
04:12:16,890 --> 04:12:19,020
fucked days.

5294
04:12:19,610 --> 04:12:20,443
But here's the thing that already 
pointed out that I think is really 

5295
04:12:22,070 --> 04:12:25,460
important for us to honestly think about
as human beings.

5296
04:12:25,640 --> 04:12:29,690
We got to a very good state of fitness 
and we should really keep it.

5297
04:12:30,060 --> 04:12:30,893
You really keep it.
You don't have to do this crazy stupid 

5298
04:12:32,991 --> 04:12:33,824
fucking thing where we compare our 
points and we have a prize and a belt 

5299
04:12:37,731 --> 04:12:38,564
every month,
but if we stayed on this system or 

5300
04:12:42,141 --> 04:12:43,350
another system,
you know,

5301
04:12:43,360 --> 04:12:48,050
to just find out what's the best way 
possible and good for you and here's the

5302
04:12:48,051 --> 04:12:50,510
thing that's really important.
I think it'll help other people too.

5303
04:12:50,900 --> 04:12:52,120
There's other people would go like,
oh,

5304
04:12:52,121 --> 04:12:53,570
what a beet red.
I want to be Joe.

5305
04:12:53,571 --> 04:12:54,700
I want to be Tom.
I wanted to be.

5306
04:12:55,240 --> 04:12:57,110
I want to beat these guys.
I want to be a part of this.

5307
04:12:57,350 --> 04:12:58,183
And then what they'll do as long as we 
emphasize this idea of don't fucking 

5308
04:13:01,791 --> 04:13:05,660
kill yourself because I don't know how 
close we got to kill ourselves,

5309
04:13:05,840 --> 04:13:07,910
but we definitely got close to breaking 
ourselves.

5310
04:13:07,990 --> 04:13:10,150
Yeah,
you got the closest for sure.

5311
04:13:10,620 --> 04:13:11,650
Body broke down.

5312
04:13:11,830 --> 04:13:12,663
Well,
I,

5313
04:13:13,090 --> 04:13:15,400
I don't know what was going on.
See,

5314
04:13:15,401 --> 04:13:16,234
here's the thing,
like if it was Rhabdo that shit super 

5315
04:13:17,831 --> 04:13:18,664
serious,
but my urine was starting to turn 

5316
04:13:20,201 --> 04:13:20,950
darker.

5317
04:13:20,950 --> 04:13:21,870
I was like,
okay,

5318
04:13:22,310 --> 04:13:24,310
we've been talking about you broke the 
bottles,

5319
04:13:24,840 --> 04:13:27,870
break a bottle,
a bottle,

5320
04:13:28,630 --> 04:13:31,090
but I'm telling you should've seen some 
of my workout sessions.

5321
04:13:31,091 --> 04:13:33,640
They were confusing.
They're confusing.

5322
04:13:33,641 --> 04:13:34,870
It was like my,
my.

5323
04:13:34,930 --> 04:13:39,930
My whole brain had shifted over to this 
a weird combat mode.

5324
04:13:40,300 --> 04:13:43,900
It was very strange.
Very strange man.

5325
04:13:44,130 --> 04:13:46,570
That's very strange for all of us,
I think.

5326
04:13:46,571 --> 04:13:48,000
I think all of us,
when I looked at Rod,

5327
04:13:48,010 --> 04:13:50,800
when red hit 479 points in a day,
I went,

5328
04:13:50,860 --> 04:13:52,570
Oh shit,
this is war.

5329
04:13:53,410 --> 04:13:57,740
It was going forward.
She's gone for like five,

5330
04:13:57,741 --> 04:13:58,940
six days.
I was like,

5331
04:13:59,030 --> 04:14:01,430
wait,
I don't need Michelle.

5332
04:14:01,670 --> 04:14:02,503
I think I could actually do this.
Do you were really going to put the 

5333
04:14:05,360 --> 04:14:06,193
strap on her.
There was no question and she had no 

5334
04:14:08,481 --> 04:14:10,730
question about keeping quiet.
I trusted her,

5335
04:14:11,480 --> 04:14:13,610
so when I.
What would your plan have been?

5336
04:14:13,640 --> 04:14:15,500
Just give it to her all the time.
All the time.

5337
04:14:15,600 --> 04:14:18,740
She runs 13 miles a day.
That's what I run.

5338
04:14:21,660 --> 04:14:23,320
Yeah.
When would you,

5339
04:14:23,520 --> 04:14:25,610
when would you have drafted on this that
you did that?

5340
04:14:26,210 --> 04:14:27,043
Never about a year later.
I year I would've kept up on this 

5341
04:14:30,111 --> 04:14:32,530
podcast or I might've said during this 
podcast is like,

5342
04:14:32,600 --> 04:14:33,260
Hey,
guess what?

5343
04:14:33,260 --> 04:14:35,090
Would you have felt like cheated the 
whole time?

5344
04:14:35,091 --> 04:14:35,924
Would you have felt comfortable saying 
it only if you'd come and let's say 

5345
04:14:38,151 --> 04:14:40,490
second or even if you had one you 
probably want,

5346
04:14:40,500 --> 04:14:43,730
especially if I want and you guys had to
pay for some fucking fancy trip that you

5347
04:14:43,731 --> 04:14:46,520
guys all decided on that have no 
interest in July.

5348
04:14:46,730 --> 04:14:47,510
Gladly

5349
04:14:47,510 --> 04:14:48,343
I would give my heart rate monitor to 
campaigns and then it would make a 

5350
04:14:50,961 --> 04:14:51,794
separate account for yourself,
a couple of count for myself and I try 

5351
04:14:54,501 --> 04:14:57,080
to beat you on my provisional ball,
but if I can't,

5352
04:14:57,150 --> 04:15:02,150
campaigns definitely beat you and then 
I'd be super humble about it but came in

5353
04:15:03,171 --> 04:15:04,070
and did a great effort.

5354
04:15:04,500 --> 04:15:07,430
How about we just tired?
I would give him my strap to burt.

5355
04:15:07,490 --> 04:15:09,890
We've got like three real again and say

5356
04:15:09,980 --> 04:15:10,813
all you guys join up and just fucking 
show your stats and we serve to the 

5357
04:15:13,610 --> 04:15:14,443
death.
I'm into this surfing thing too because 

5358
04:15:16,971 --> 04:15:20,480
I don't know how to surf at all and I 
have two surfers on the month.

5359
04:15:20,810 --> 04:15:21,830
Really?
I had Kelly,

5360
04:15:21,880 --> 04:15:22,713
Shane,
Shane Dorian on just a couple of hours 

5361
04:15:25,010 --> 04:15:26,050
ago.
They sit in the,

5362
04:15:26,110 --> 04:15:27,650
in the,
in the the beach,

5363
04:15:27,680 --> 04:15:29,750
and they push you and you start actually
surfing.

5364
04:15:30,260 --> 04:15:35,260
It's fucking fun and surfers have the 
best body and the guy's going.

5365
04:15:35,960 --> 04:15:40,600
Gambling.
I will send a sound.

5366
04:15:40,601 --> 04:15:44,410
What's his name now?
What's the big wave surfer in Maui?

5367
04:15:44,460 --> 04:15:45,680
Oh,
fucking laird.

5368
04:15:45,681 --> 04:15:50,681
Hamilton has.
I have to get him on his bass player.

5369
04:15:51,700 --> 04:15:55,090
Hamilton's doing underwater toward the 
work.

5370
04:15:55,091 --> 04:15:57,380
Have you seen him?
Oh my God.

5371
04:15:57,440 --> 04:16:01,340
They're all beasts.
Surfers or like a very unusual athlete.

5372
04:16:01,370 --> 04:16:02,203
You're.
They're wrestling with mother nature on 

5373
04:16:03,171 --> 04:16:05,940
a fucking dropped off a helicopters onto
the weight.

5374
04:16:07,700 --> 04:16:12,440
Laird Hamilton is next fucking level.
There's a lot of those guys out there.

5375
04:16:12,800 --> 04:16:13,633
There's so many,
like really fucking powerful big wave 

5376
04:16:16,431 --> 04:16:18,320
surfers.
I want him on your podcast.

5377
04:16:18,321 --> 04:16:23,321
Bad Man.
He'd be a great one for Gabby reese.

5378
04:16:24,560 --> 04:16:25,760
Reese when?
Florida state.

5379
04:16:25,850 --> 04:16:26,683
Yeah,
she did volleyball thing about surfing 

5380
04:16:29,480 --> 04:16:31,700
too is you also have monsters in the 
mix.

5381
04:16:32,270 --> 04:16:33,103
Sharks,
Kelly slater didn't want to talk about 

5382
04:16:38,421 --> 04:16:41,060
sharks like I listen to podcasts.
He was like,

5383
04:16:41,920 --> 04:16:42,753
he was a little bit.
I didn't think he emphasized it because 

5384
04:16:44,751 --> 04:16:46,790
I don't think he thinks it's as big of a
deal.

5385
04:16:46,820 --> 04:16:51,530
He's definitely drew as a listener.
He emphasized that they were there,

5386
04:16:51,531 --> 04:16:53,660
that they are all there the all the 
time,

5387
04:16:53,661 --> 04:16:55,820
but he kept like dodging it and I was 
like,

5388
04:16:55,821 --> 04:16:56,654
man,
it is one of those weird things where 

5389
04:16:57,561 --> 04:16:58,394
you look at a guy who spent that much 
time in the water and never had a like 

5390
04:17:02,240 --> 04:17:04,010
had to deal with it and then his friends
have.

5391
04:17:04,430 --> 04:17:05,810
That's fucking insane,
man.

5392
04:17:05,990 --> 04:17:09,800
To charts are fucking fault that 
imagining me,

5393
04:17:09,801 --> 04:17:12,640
you have no control in their world.
You're,

5394
04:17:12,660 --> 04:17:14,960
you're,
you're agreeing to being a,

5395
04:17:15,110 --> 04:17:20,110
like a movement in paired entity in a 
struggling alien world.

5396
04:17:20,541 --> 04:17:21,374
Like you can't figure he could barely 
get by for thrash in your arms and legs 

5397
04:17:25,030 --> 04:17:27,340
and a shock could just wiggle up and 
slap.

5398
04:17:28,130 --> 04:17:28,963
Take a big chunk out of your leg and 
you're dead in the water with a great 

5399
04:17:32,181 --> 04:17:35,220
white open water.
Open water.

5400
04:17:36,760 --> 04:17:38,840
I was,
I didn't have a snorkel on,

5401
04:17:38,841 --> 04:17:40,850
but I had a mask.
I was just looking down at them.

5402
04:17:40,851 --> 04:17:41,241
No,
no,

5403
04:17:41,241 --> 04:17:42,530
no.
It was in the water with it.

5404
04:17:42,531 --> 04:17:47,150
I was out of the cage and there's a 
great white dude you find this on.

5405
04:17:47,151 --> 04:17:49,580
I'm sure you can find this online,
but it was,

5406
04:17:49,670 --> 04:17:50,503
it was all I knew is that it was the 
only animal I'd move with it and move 

5407
04:17:53,691 --> 04:17:54,920
with that much intention.

5408
04:17:55,250 --> 04:17:56,083
Like everything they did was like,
so like the way you get attacked by a 

5409
04:17:59,571 --> 04:18:01,400
cat ever been attacked by a cat and 
you're like,

5410
04:18:01,640 --> 04:18:03,290
motherfucker,
I can't stop it.

5411
04:18:04,440 --> 04:18:09,440
Did you like think at any point in time?
Like this could be how I go in the water

5412
04:18:10,561 --> 04:18:11,280
with a sharp.
No,

5413
04:18:11,280 --> 04:18:13,070
I've been in.
I've been in the water with great whites

5414
04:18:13,090 --> 04:18:15,150
couple times.
No,

5415
04:18:15,151 --> 04:18:15,900
no,
no,

5416
04:18:15,900 --> 04:18:17,970
no.
Fuck.

5417
04:18:18,610 --> 04:18:22,860
If you went to overwhelming man,
they really are not like that now.

5418
04:18:22,920 --> 04:18:23,753
Now it would be a fucking killer video.
Like now that all the Shit I did before 

5419
04:18:28,010 --> 04:18:30,120
I fall,
I fall pairs.

5420
04:18:30,150 --> 04:18:32,250
He did it all.
But like now if I did that,

5421
04:18:32,251 --> 04:18:37,251
that would go viral to do it and do it 
now.

5422
04:18:40,480 --> 04:18:44,130
Just to stand up now.
I just do standup comedy shots,

5448
04:19:43,860 --> 04:19:47,640
Let's go eat.
Let's go eat a lot of really doing the.

5449
04:19:47,790 --> 04:19:49,920
Oh wait,
we should do it.

5450
04:19:49,920 --> 04:19:53,160
Let's do something big.
Let's do Madison Square Garden.

5451
04:19:53,161 --> 04:19:54,720
Yeah,
we can do something like that.

5452
04:19:55,250 --> 04:19:56,620
Break even.
Let's just show us.

5453
04:19:56,630 --> 04:19:59,430
I think it'll be fun.
Red Rocks in Colorado.

5454
04:19:59,490 --> 04:20:00,323
That was the cool thing though.
I got an offer for like two years from 

5455
04:20:07,321 --> 04:20:08,760
now.
One of those two.

5456
04:20:08,910 --> 04:20:10,390
Yeah,
but I'm saying like that's how.

5457
04:20:10,570 --> 04:20:11,403
All right,
let's sign up for 20 fucking weasels 

5458
04:20:13,730 --> 04:20:15,350
land.
I can do a bunch of shit.

5459
04:20:15,450 --> 04:20:16,980
Listen,
we can have a lot of fun.

5460
04:20:17,040 --> 04:20:20,280
Especially like right now,
like where we only have to do 30 each.

5461
04:20:20,700 --> 04:20:21,533
Oh,
let's do it.

5462
04:20:21,840 --> 04:20:23,070
Let's do it.
I'm in.

5463
04:20:23,071 --> 04:20:26,070
I'm at 100 percent.
One hundred percent fun.

5464
04:20:26,640 --> 04:20:28,200
I'll do it.
It would be cool to that.

5465
04:20:28,201 --> 04:20:31,170
Pick a place gentleman.
All bullshit aside.

5466
04:20:32,150 --> 04:20:34,120
Really fun month.
It was,

5467
04:20:34,170 --> 04:20:35,940
it felt,
made me really happy.

5468
04:20:36,120 --> 04:20:39,150
It was fun.
The comradery was appreciated.

5469
04:20:39,151 --> 04:20:41,610
It was exciting.
It was ridiculous.

5470
04:20:41,630 --> 04:20:42,760
It was fun,
but it was hard,

5471
04:20:42,761 --> 04:20:44,610
but it was hard.
It was fucking hard.

5472
04:20:44,611 --> 04:20:45,444
But it was also,
it was fun and it felt good and they 

5473
04:20:47,941 --> 04:20:48,900
like.
Even though I was like,

5474
04:20:48,901 --> 04:20:49,351
you know,
fuck,

5475
04:20:49,351 --> 04:20:53,880
this guy's going to kill him.
God Damn there was ice still was like,

5476
04:20:53,910 --> 04:20:56,190
wow,
I can't believe what everybody's doing.

5477
04:20:56,320 --> 04:21:00,960
Everybody was pushing so hard.
I would've never went as hard as I did.

5478
04:21:01,200 --> 04:21:03,960
If it wasn't for you guys.
There's not a chance in hell.

5479
04:21:04,560 --> 04:21:05,920
Not A in hell.

5480
04:21:06,130 --> 04:21:08,500
There's no way I would've gone that 
hard.

5481
04:21:08,530 --> 04:21:10,930
No,
I've never gone that hard in my life.

5482
04:21:10,990 --> 04:21:11,823
If you had a point any 31 day a month in
my life and you put out like how much 

5483
04:21:17,561 --> 04:21:22,030
effort I put forth,
that's as crazy as probably more.

5484
04:21:22,060 --> 04:21:25,810
I've probably been a bit of better 
fighter if I train that hard back when I

5485
04:21:25,811 --> 04:21:29,560
was competing for fucking three 
nonathletes and one guy was running away

5486
04:21:29,561 --> 04:21:34,561
from the memory of his father due to 
fucking go to school and listen,

5487
04:21:37,331 --> 04:21:38,164
we're all fucked up,
but what's important is we showed human 

5488
04:21:40,031 --> 04:21:42,070
potential.
We show its potential.

5489
04:21:42,210 --> 04:21:43,043
Yeah.
We showed that whatever we thought we 

5490
04:21:44,231 --> 04:21:46,690
were capable of,
we're capable of so much more.

5491
04:21:46,810 --> 04:21:48,430
Now.
The question is whether or not we should

5492
04:21:48,431 --> 04:21:52,030
continue to put out that kind of effort.
I say no,

5493
04:21:52,300 --> 04:21:56,380
but I do say that we've reached a really
healthy,

5494
04:21:56,410 --> 04:21:59,560
powerful level of fitness.
We should definitely keep up some of it.

5495
04:21:59,970 --> 04:22:02,930
We've got to try to do that.
It was just something totally different.

5496
04:22:02,980 --> 04:22:05,530
Totally.
Whether it's ballet dancing,

5497
04:22:08,520 --> 04:22:11,440
we should compete each other.
A burst gonna drink rep right now,

5498
04:22:11,441 --> 04:22:16,441
right bird is going to drink rsp bottle 
or dancing with the stars next year.

5499
04:22:17,050 --> 04:22:19,610
A MOCHA.
Alright.

5500
04:22:20,430 --> 04:22:21,263

Joe Rogan.com.

5502
04:22:25,781 --> 04:22:26,880
That's it.
It's a wrap.

5503
04:22:27,440 --> 04:22:29,320
We did it.
We will see you guys two weeks late.

5504
04:22:29,390 --> 04:22:34,390
Just champ champ on that.
Go Fund me.
