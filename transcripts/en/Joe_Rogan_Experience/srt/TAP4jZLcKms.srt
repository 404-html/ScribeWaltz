00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,900
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,120
That tank,

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,640
um,

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,170
is also something that helps you,

5
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:08,150
and this is where the connection
to this journal comes from.

6
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,661
Juan,

7
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:09,980
you were going through this breakup,

8
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:11,810
you'd kind of reassessed your whole life.

9
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,430
It was really interesting to watch.

10
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:13,791
You know,

11
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:14,300
you,

12
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,830
you came when you called me up and you
were really bummed out and she kicked you

13
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:20,300
out and you were at a hotel room.

14
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:20,590
Yeah.

15
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,081
And I'm like,

16
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:21,281
Hey,

17
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,400
you fucking come live with me.

18
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:23,480
And then you moved and you were like,

19
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,680
just a little frazzled.

20
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:25,011
You were like,

21
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:25,430
yeah,

22
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,151
thanks a lot man.

23
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:26,811
I really appreciate it.

24
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:26,961
I'm like,

25
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:27,171
Hey,

26
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:27,951
I'm living by myself.

27
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:28,521
This is all good.

28
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:28,701
You know,

29
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:29,570
Dunkin's live with me now.

30
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,381
We're going to have some fun.

31
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:31,101
It's been the only dude.

32
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:31,934
Everything's gonna be fine.

33
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,120
But you were clearly like lost,

34
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,530
you know,

35
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:35,790
you'd,

36
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,020
you'd,

37
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,853
you'd like gotten,

38
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,100
you know,

39
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,450
when you get dumped man,

40
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:40,970
it's like just fucking feeling of shit.

41
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,620
I don't have a home anymore.

42
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,101
Like,

43
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,720
where am I sleeping now?

44
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,621
Civ like,

45
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:45,951
just,

46
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:46,190
uh,

47
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,150
towards your direction,

48
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,320
change complete.

49
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,170
You've been living this
certain way along enough to,

50
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,210
to get used to it and then all of a
sudden everything absolutely changes,

51
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,220
like just a huge torque turn that
you probably thought could happen.

52
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:01,640
But you're,

53
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,180
you know,

54
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,450
trying to imagine that it wasn't
even a possibility and it happens.

55
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,261
Well that,

56
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:06,591
yeah,

57
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,420
that's like you go into shock,

58
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,270
you're attached to a certain rhythm,

59
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,500
a certain pattern,

60
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,200
a certain set of surroundings
that massively changes you.

61
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,120
You go into shock and that is the perfect
time to get in a fucking flotation

62
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,600
tank when everything's discombobulated
and floating around inside of you and all

63
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:24,650
the other,

64
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,041
uh,

65
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,290
weird assemblage of emotions.

66
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,120
And more than anything though,

67
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:31,880
what's cool about that shit is
you get a real taste of truth.

68
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,100
Like that's what truth is right there.

69
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:36,380
That's like the experience of truth,

70
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:37,370
which is change,

71
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:38,930
which is dramatic.

72
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,030
Radical change.

73
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,280
Fucking unavoidable happens all the time.

74
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,731
Did the,

75
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:47,910
the isolation tank keeps you
from distracting yourself
and makes you think about

76
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:48,710
your life?

77
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,930
Yeah.

78
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,220
It makes you think about what's going on.

79
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,400
So for me it was so fascinating
having you here at a real low point.

80
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,730
And watching you pull right
out of it right out of it,

81
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,020
like very quickly,

82
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:01,730
like,

83
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:01,900
well,

84
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,840
you got into that tank within a few weeks,

85
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:04,380
man,

86
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,690
you were laughing about shit
and joking around about it.

87
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:06,981
Sure,

88
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:07,814
yeah.

89
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,121
Yeah.

90
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:08,901
They always cool.

91
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:09,390
It was,

92
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:09,801
yeah,

93
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:11,060
it definitely,

94
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,290
definitely helps.

95
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:17,210
And that's why this is my friends are
so important because like if you don't

96
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,130
have friends and you get
into that predicament oh,

97
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,731
terrible.

98
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:24,950
So worst feeling more it
feel completely alone.

99
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,491
Yeah.

100
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:25,911
Yeah.

101
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:26,180
And,

102
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,320
but you know,

103
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,370
even if you don't have friends,

104
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:30,350
you can still pull yourself out of it,

105
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,250
but you have to,

106
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,500
I guess really Wa you know,

107
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:33,770
you,

108
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,000
you have to want to,

109
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,980
yeah,

110
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,390
yeah.

111
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,710
You,

112
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,031
well,

113
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:37,211
it's,

114
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:37,691
it's mean,

115
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:37,931
it's,

116
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:38,141
look,

117
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:41,410
anyone can can improve their surroundings
so you can improve your situation.

118
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,980
But it was really interesting for me
watching you because it was a such an

119
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:48,100
unusual opportunity for both of us.

120
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,370
It was an unusual opportunity for me to
watch someone who didn't have a lot of

121
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,480
experience with a tank,

122
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,510
but who was such a curious person and
psychedelically experience like you and

123
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:00,400
then have access to this
thing a on a daily basis,

124
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,091
you know?

125
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:05,290
And for me to watch you go from
this like really low point to like,

126
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,660
they're like really like gaining ground.

127
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,700
Like you came out of it like stronger.

128
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,510
It was so fucking cool

129
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,520
climbing out of that thing in
that state of being in the,

130
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,830
in the state of like having had,

131
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,870
because you know,

132
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,170
so I could,

133
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,530
psychedelics are not limited it drugs.

134
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,990
There are many ways to induce
a psychedelic state of mind.

135
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,490
The tank being one of them.

136
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,960
And um,

137
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,430
another way to induce a psychedelic
state of mind is to have dramatic change

138
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:38,431
happened in your life that rips back
whatever delusion you are living by and

139
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,580
shows you

140
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,190
the true universe.

141
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,521
Yeah.

142
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,660
People turn the term psychedelic to a
lot of people means like seeing things

143
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:47,490
that aren't their hallucinations,

144
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,600
dancing mice,

145
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:48,811
you know,

146
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,501
Shit like that.

147
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,090
Pink elephants flying in the sky.

148
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,370
That's not a real psychedelic state.

149
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,520
The real psychedelic state is
the dissolution of cultural
conformity and the the

150
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:58,960
Ah,

151
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,540
your ideas of the universe,

152
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,660
all your predetermined
patterns of thinking all your,

153
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,700
you're adopted behavior patterns,

154
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:09,360
all that gets stripped away and you're
left with the core of you and your

155
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:10,260
decisions and,

156
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,101
and what,

157
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:12,660
what you can and can't change.

158
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,380
And how you led yourself into a position
where you were so weak in the first

159
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,011
place that you,

160
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:17,251
you know,

161
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:18,780
you needed saving from.

162
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,640
Like what,

163
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,281
what were,

164
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,870
why did you have no foundation?

165
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:22,710
Why did you fall apart?

166
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,300
Like what is it about,

167
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,661
you know,

168
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:28,050
life and about trying to get by in
this world that leaves us so fucking

169
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,010
vulnerable sometimes.

170
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,010
And so in need of other human beings is
to to stack us up and to hold us up and

171
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:37,110
watching you man was really fucking cool.

172
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,820
It was really cool because
you really used it,

173
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:39,001
man.

174
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,050
You got in there all the time,

175
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,530
you know,

176
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:40,891
and you are,

177
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,720
you are getting out and talking about it.

178
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:43,141
And it was,

179
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,070
it was fucking trip.

180
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:44,221
You know,

181
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:46,890
I don't know if you wrote it about it
in the thing because I didn't read it.

182
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,580
I,

183
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,900
I've had that thing for years.

184
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,400
They didn't even take a look at that.

185
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,210
I read to him over the phone and
then he made me stop and I said,

186
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:54,421
all right,

187
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:55,380
I won't read any more of it.

188
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,760
I was just eight years ago,

189
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,150
I got a thing has been
sitting in my fucking,

190
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,730
my office for tariff.

191
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,530
I think it's like 2004
so what year was this?

192
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,030
Wait til I didn't date it.

193
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,760
2004 or 2005 I believe it was.

194
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,493
Yeah.

195
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,851
It's cool though.

196
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:12,271
I mean you're,

197
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:12,510
you,

198
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,880
you got a window into a
certain time in your life.

199
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,840
You know where you were.

200
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,610
You were in the shifts.

201
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,060
Well,

202
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,110
I'll tell you man,

203
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,720
that unfortunately happens.

204
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,970
But you know,

205
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,511
you say that,

206
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,770
but I don't think it's unfortunate at all.

207
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,101
Oh,

208
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:27,640
right.

209
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,930
If you were stuck with that chick now,

210
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,320
no,

211
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,153
Jesus Christ.

212
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,121
Think about that.

213
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,370
Thinking about your situation now and
thinking about your situation then,

214
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:34,350
how much happier you are now,

215
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:34,560
right?

216
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,590
You could have been stuck.

217
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,460
Me Ma,

218
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,001
if you know,

219
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,430
if you talked her into taking
you back or something gross.

220
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,683
Oh,

221
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,830
with a child or something.

222
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,900
Jesus Christ right there.

223
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,071
You know what I mean?

224
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:48,370
It's funny how you're a
different human now then.

225
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,860
Yeah,

226
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,960
you're so much more confident.

227
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:50,321
You know?

228
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,840
It's one of the things that I
saw when you went up in Montreal,

229
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,430
right?

230
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,870
I keeping your sats now
you're so much more confident.

231
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,831
You go up there,

232
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:57,820
you're much more,

233
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,760
you know,

234
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,930
you're so much more,

235
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,540
what's the word you,

236
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:01,910
you,

237
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,130
you were re resigned to who?

238
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,280
You are not,

239
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,021
not resigned.

240
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:06,650
Rather you're,

241
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,483
you're not,

242
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,470
but it's not resigned that,

243
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,910
cause that sounds like you're giving up.

244
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,481
It's not,

245
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,170
that's not what I mean.

246
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,421
You're,

247
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:14,750
you are completely aware of who you are.

248
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,800
That's the best way of saying it.

249
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,100
And that when you're going on
stage now you're going on stage,

250
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,320
not trying to convince them of anything.

251
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,860
You're just,

252
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,530
this is me and this is what I'm
doing is what I have to say.

253
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,210
Whereas before you were like,

254
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:26,511
Hey,

255
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,590
I hope you like me.

256
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,851
Do you like me?

257
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:29,511
You don't like me?

258
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:29,781
Well,

259
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,740
here I'm going to say something,

260
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,430
I guess.

261
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,263
I guess that,

262
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,920
yeah,

263
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,420
I think the reason the word
resigned popped out of your
mouth first is because I

264
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:40,000
think there is a certain level of being,

265
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,310
and it sounds like it's
like I'm giving up,

266
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:46,420
but resigned can also be like a
kind of surrender where you're like,

267
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,260
I'm just no longer going to spend time,

268
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:53,680
whether on stage or off stage.

269
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,850
I'm not going to spend time anymore
trying to convince myself or other people

270
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,720
that I'm some certain way and I'm going
to start trying to approach people from

271
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,560
where I'm at.

272
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,160
Yes.

273
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,730
Which is,

274
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,420
which is not a perfect
place for most people.

275
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:08,860
Most most of us are,

276
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,293
you know,

277
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,400
have fucked up things that we do.

278
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:13,360
And why wouldn't you?

279
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:13,601
I mean,

280
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,490
you're going to look at where you're at.

281
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,481
Like you say,

282
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:19,120
we're in a fucking ball
flying through fucking space.

283
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,850
How are you supposed to adapt to this?

284
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,440
And some brilliant way,

285
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,880
right off the bat,

286
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,550
you know you,

287
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:25,990
yeah,

288
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,650
it's a champ.

289
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,850
You're in this insane dimension where
were getting rocketed through space where

290
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,870
you're to die.

291
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,100
You're surrounded by people
who call themselves your
family that you're supposed

292
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:37,480
to have attachments to,

293
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,830
they're going to die.

294
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:42,670
You're in a life where you've just
adopted certain modes of being.

295
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,990
I didn't have a baby,

296
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,250
I didn't get married,

297
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,720
but a lot of people do when they weren't
ready and they weren't supposed to and

298
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:54,070
they get married and they have a baby
and they are theoretically for this

299
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:54,904
incarnation,

300
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
pretty fucking trapped there in

301
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:57,930
lot of people are,

302
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,270
a lot of people have yet they have all
kinds of weird situations where the

303
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,040
relationship,

304
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,500
they're stuck somehow or another,

305
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:06,600
whether it's because of a mortgage or
because of a business that they started

306
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,443
together,

307
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,930
a mental idea of how things are supposed
to do with some person or you give

308
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:15,931
birth to a child that has like a a melted
brain and you've got to take care of

309
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:21,571
like a little like sick kid for 12 years
or like there's so many different ways

310
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:27,421
that your particular DNA can get
reverberated down into a shitty trap where

311
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,360
you're just like there.

312
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,151
It's like a,

313
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:32,230
that's why I liked that movie.

314
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:35,230
You said you didn't want to see it and
I'm sorry if you've seen it in like it,

315
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,270
but what was that hundred and 27 hours?

316
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:38,000
Did you see that?

317
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,271
No,

318
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:40,610
I didn't see it because
I knew the story and I,

319
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:41,330
you know,

320
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,180
I don't want to wash them.

321
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,330
Did

322
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:42,720
happen.

323
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,940
That's just a torture movie.

324
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,020
There's no reason to watch.

325
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,510
Everybody says that it's a torture movie.

326
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:49,940
Like it was fixated on the Gore or the,

327
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,781
but it wasn't,

328
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,740
it's a fucking metaphor,

329
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:52,574
which is that,

330
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,130
uh,

331
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,040
some times doing the,

332
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,350
you love to do whatever it is and that's
for a lot of people's fucking doing the

333
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:02,340
thing you love most,

334
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,070
you can end up getting
your goddamn arm pen down.

335
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,400
You're connecting someone,

336
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,230
having a baby to cutting your arm off.

337
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:09,680
That's funny.

338
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,101
No,

339
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:10,934
I'm kidding.

340
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,510
No,

341
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm not connecting.

342
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,110
If you have a baby for the right reason.

343
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,311
No,

344
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,570
I know what you're saying
for the wrong reasons.

345
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,871
I know,

346
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:16,490
I know what you're saying.

347
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,740
Like you were saying what a lot of
single people with no children say.

348
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,030
And what you're saying is,

349
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:21,361
you know,

350
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,540
we were talking about our friend who
tweeted something about having a child is

351
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,670
like the exact opposite
of winning the lottery.

352
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,480
Yeah.

353
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,790
I used to think the exact
same way until I had children,

354
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,270
but my situation is
very different in that,

355
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,781
first of all,

356
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,980
I'm older,

357
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:37,310
I've had more experience in life and um,

358
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,220
I'm secure financially and
happy in the relationship.

359
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,620
So it was all good things at a good time.

360
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,320
But when I look back
on past relationships,

361
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:46,970
some of them,

362
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,990
there was a bunch of
relationships that I've been in,

363
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,650
you know,

364
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,880
like way back in the day when I was
younger and I really didn't know what the

365
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:56,430
fuck I was doing and I was hanging
around with chicks that I probably really

366
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:57,540
didn't even like that much,

367
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,070
but I was still having sex with them.

368
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,910
And sometimes you'd have like a crazy
fucking breakup or we're crazy bad

369
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:03,390
relationship,

370
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,310
that person could it be
out there with your kid?

371
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,390
And then you have to deal with all kinds
of the nonsense that comes with that.

372
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:09,691
I mean,

373
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:11,390
we all know somebody that has kids,

374
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,880
you know,

375
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,590
some shit situation.

376
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,841
So I,

377
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:16,110
I hear what you're saying man.

378
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,980
What did that so what,

379
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,341
yeah,

380
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:20,650
what I'm really saying is like the,

381
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,790
the idea and it goes back to what we're
being comfortable resigned to who you

382
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,624
are.

383
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,800
That's where I didn't like the way I said
resign though I didn't mean reside is

384
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,540
just sometimes you hard to be resigned.

385
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,321
You know what I mean?

386
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:34,120
Not all of us are fucking Charlie Sheen,

387
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,640
not all stars from Mars.

388
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:37,191
Not all of us,

389
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:38,930
sort of a freaking rock star from Mars.

390
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,450
Some of us are like,

391
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,170
we all trying to pretend that I'm not
special or fucked up and a lot of ways

392
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:44,421
man,

393
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:44,560
and,

394
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,280
and that's,

395
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,061
if you start from,

396
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:46,894
it's like,

397
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:47,861
you know,

398
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:49,210
one thing that I would try to do,

399
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:51,130
and I used to work out
and it's like when I,

400
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,610
when I,

401
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,170
when I first started working out,

402
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,210
I would try to lift weight that was so
much more heavy than what I should have

403
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:02,320
been lifting out of this sense of
like I could lift heavy weights.

404
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,490
And so now I'm like trying to live like
way too well I don't like why should it

405
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,820
be at the fucking pink weights and
I'm like trying to take a quick,

406
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:10,301
you know what I mean?

407
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:13,720
I'm trying to do like really fucking heavy
weights cause it's like this is how I

408
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:17,880
see myself down the line after I've
been lifting pink waits for awhile.

409
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,450
That's how you get to the heavyweights.

410
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,770
But if you start off right away trying
to pump those fucking heavyweights,

411
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,270
then it's disaster.

412
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:28,630
You're going to pull your
fucking muscles like people how,

413
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,610
you know like due to lifting weights.

414
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,690
One guy think came up to me,

415
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,750
he's like looking at me
like what are you doing?

416
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:37,900
He's like that's way too much weight.

417
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,010
And so this is like having a kid when
you're 16 having a kid when you were 16 or

418
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:47,011
deciding that you're a famous comedian
before you are getting on stage after a

419
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,020
couple of months and getting in your
fucking head that you're like you've been

420
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:55,021
doing standup for 15 years or being a
fucking when and like just immediately

421
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:56,500
thinking you're a great painter.

422
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:58,270
Cause I've had friends
who've gotten into painting,

423
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,960
right.

424
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,440
And they've only painted for a year and
they show me some of their paintings and

425
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:03,610
the look on their face is like,

426
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:04,900
I'm supposed to react to it.

427
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,760
Like I'm seeing a Picasso or something.

428
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:08,050
It's like I hate

429
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,900
almost everyone that shows me things that
I'm supposed to look at that they did

430
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,210
almost every time someone does that to me.

431
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:15,020
I'm like,

432
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,150
are you really going to do this to me man,

433
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:16,850
I'm these.

434
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,683
No,

435
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,930
don't make me read your fucking script.

436
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,910
Don't ask me to read your script.

437
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,490
You fuck take you read my script row.

438
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,473
It's the worst.

439
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,310
The worst is when it's bad.

440
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,500
And then you're obligated
to talk to them and go,

441
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:30,741
all right,

442
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:31,730
here's the situation.

443
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,301
You know,

444
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:36,350
you basically did men and
black meets back to the future,

445
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:37,730
written by a 12 year old.

446
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,420
You know,

447
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,253
like it's like,

448
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,280
I can't say that.

449
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,170
We can't even say that.

450
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:42,501
You have to go,

451
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:42,771
well,

452
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:43,880
I'm as pretty good man.

453
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,833
It's pretty good.

454
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,410
Well now then you're gonna
see that's the thing.

455
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,990
That's where you get and I think
kind of what we're talking about,

456
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:52,230
which is like at some point
you have to make a decision.

457
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,420
Am I going to spend the rest
of my life lying to the world?

458
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,410
Am I going to spend the rest of my life
men trying to manipulate people around

459
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:05,630
me because I'm too lazy to tell them
the truth or am I just going to start

460
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,710
telling the truth?

461
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,521
But what if it though,

462
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,710
if it's a friend that's written
something really cool though,

463
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,190
what if someone has got
a script and it means,

464
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,940
so that's the problem with
all the shitheads that want
you to read their scripts

465
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,300
and makes you super skeptical for the
occasional rare person that actually write

466
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:18,830
something good and it's just like,

467
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:18,951
Hey,

468
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:19,860
I think this is pretty good.

469
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,140
You want to read it and then you're like,

470
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,510
Eh,

471
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:21,801
all right,

472
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,310
I'll read it.

473
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,791
You know what I mean?

474
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,210
How many,

475
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,110
how many of those are there?

476
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,340
People I know who are
really good at things,

477
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,020
they don't ask me to look at it.

478
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,950
I ended up looking at it cause
I want to like my friend email,

479
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:34,410
he just visited like his
music's fucking good.

480
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,660
So like I tried to get new cds of his,

481
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,980
cause I wanna listen to it.

482
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,600
That's really fucking good.

483
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,020
But sometimes somebody
else sends you something

484
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,440
or somebody be in their car if they're
a musician and then they'll put their

485
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:45,830
shit,

486
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,000
don't have to listen to it.

487
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,950
That is never let a musician drive and
never let them get in your car with a CD.

488
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,363
It's in your hand,

489
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,043
your fucking hand,

490
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,550
because you're suddenly,

491
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:06,200
you're forced suddenly not
just to evaluate how miserable
and artists they are,

492
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,300
how close Shane shitty their music is.

493
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,350
But also you have to,

494
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,910
you realize that the fact that they felt
comfortable playing this for you means

495
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:14,840
they think it's good.

496
