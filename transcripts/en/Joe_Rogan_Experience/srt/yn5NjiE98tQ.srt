1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,983
We're live bobcat.
Goldthwait what the fuck are you doing 

2
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:07,964
going on?
Big Foot convention and then a moth man 

3
00:00:09,381 --> 00:00:11,510
convention.
We know now you're ranking bad guy.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,670
You're a grown man.
I,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,513
uh,
I just went to see where the month man 

6
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:19,190
was or how bad.
It wasn't a moth man convention.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,960
No,

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,330
I was about,
uh,

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,630
at the,
I was in the,

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:23,943
at the Ohio bigfoot conference,
which was less than two hours away from 

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,950
point pleasant West Virginia where the 
moth man appeared.

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,750
Uh,
and uh,

13
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,270
when I was talking with some of this,
you know,

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,150
big foot researchers,
I said,

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,070
you do that with air quotes when you say
that the researchers,

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,990
I was talking to him and I said,
hey,

17
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,930
you know,
we're really close to where the moth man

18
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:45,100
was.
And they're like,

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,930
well,
the Mosman is not real.

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,180
Oh,
so do they silly that?

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,090
No,
no.

22
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,870
Well,
some did.

23
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,710
You know,
that's the thing.

24
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,740
Zimmerman categories of,
of uh,

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,770
big foot,
uh,

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,740
people,
there's people who are self aware.

27
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:06,990
There's people who are,
who seem pretty regular and you don't,

28
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:09,670
that's the thing.
You go to these conventions and,

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,740
and um,
you have this idea of what a person is,

30
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,130
who believes that there's an 800 pound 
wood ape out there.

31
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,540
And then,
um,

32
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,520
when you get to know them,
you realize that,

33
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:24,310
um,
they're really fucking weird.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,930
Yeah,
no,

35
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:28,060
I'm kidding.
But there is that,

36
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:30,070
there is a lot of that.
There's a lot of that,

37
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,480
but I,
I have to say,

38
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,330
uh,
I love them.

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,280
I had a great time.
Uh,

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,900
and uh,
it was really fun.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,730
It was great.
I've had some people that I talked to.

42
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:43,130
What was the professor from?
Uh,

43
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,930
Belgium?
Yes.

44
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,360
Professor Meldrum,
who's a really interesting guy for sure.

45
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,860
Who is,
do you know who he is?

46
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,030
Pretty prominent.
Yeah.

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,110
And the big foot community who's a very 
rational,

48
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:58,640
reasonable person that told me he would 
cut his pinky off to know the truth.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,410
Ah,
hoping.

50
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,520
And you said,
you know what,

51
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,810
I can do it.
I'll do it with an arrow.

52
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,910
I'm more fascinated about,

53
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,850
I mean,
I'm sure your listeners are more,

54
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:12,601
you know,
over it,

55
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,434
but it,
about you going out and hunting a bear 

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,000
with an arrow.
What's interest eating them.

57
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,380
It's really interesting.
What kind of,

58
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:20,730
what is it?
What does it taste good?

59
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,410
They taste really good.
Like,

60
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,220
like,
uh,

61
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,053
like I,
the way I describe it as like a deer 

62
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:25,770
fucked a pig.

63
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,630
It's,
it's kind of almost taking,

64
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:32,241
uh,
uh,

65
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:33,160
the,
uh,

66
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,420
tofurky to a new level.
But I,

67
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,260
uh,

68
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,280
you know,
my brother,

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,810
uh,
he was,

70
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,610
he passed away.
My brother was a,

71
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:42,710
uh,
um,

72
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,850
uh,
I kind of say a hunter,

73
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:46,950
but he was actually a poacher.
My brother,

74
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,580
when he passed away,
uh,

75
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,900
people said,
hey,

76
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:52,710
can,
um,

77
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,080
can I have your doe permit?
And I was like,

78
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,400
what?
He's like,

79
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,560
my brother had been getting a dope 
permit in my name

80
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,320
for like 20 years.
Oh,

81
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,154
really?
Yeah.

82
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,960
He had all these forge dope.
It's,

83
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,710
he shot animals all year long.
He didn't read the game.

84
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:11,710
Warden was bused into his home with a 
bolt cutter,

85
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,573
you know,
lock cutters and a crack open his 

86
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:18,070
freezer and there'd be all this game out
of season.

87
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,870
Oh Man.
He,

88
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:20,621
uh,
yeah,

89
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:21,454
but you know,
he ate it.

90
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,810
Right.
But he,

91
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,650
uh,
yeah,

92
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,050
yeah.
He didn't abide by the rules?

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,950
Well,
no,

94
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,873
no,
it did not abide by all anyone's roles 

95
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,770
is his funeral was uh,
it was awesome and Eclectic,

96
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,790
but there's two things.
Someone should have given me a heads up.

97
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,290
Well,
first of all,

98
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,750
a couple of the pallbearers were in 
Cammo.

99
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,521
Really?
Yeah,

100
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:46,690
yeah,
a serious hunter,

101
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,980
hunter,
biker.

102
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,160
Where do you live?
A central New York and Syracuse and then

103
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,170
Rome and around.
But you know,

104
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,310
I love my brother,
but he was wild and,

105
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:56,144
and then the other thing,
they probably should have given me a 

106
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:01,660
heads up that it's friend a little.

107
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,660
Ricky was one of the pallbearers.
Yeah,

108
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,690
he was,
uh,

109
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,880
uh,
I just like,

110
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,720
I don't want to use the word,
I was going to say like a Munchkin.

111
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,554
Good,
safe.

112
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,220
I didn't want to use the other word.
I mean he wasn't even a tiny person.

113
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,050
It's a little person.
He wasn't a dwarf,

114
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,110
but cause you know,
he was regular size almost.

115
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:24,370
I don't know.
He was tiny,

116
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,440
but he didn't look,
you know what I mean?

117
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,453
I get it.
But nobody said ricky was going to be a 

118
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:33,400
Paul bear or giving me a heads up.
So I looked down the end of the church.

119
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,043
He's in the middle,
on one side of the casket and then 

120
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,140
middle.
Yeah.

121
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,250
And I said to my daughter,
go,

122
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,680
looks like Ricky's riding a subway.
My Dad,

123
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:49,681
he's like,
I think he just got air freezes going on

124
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,314
about how am I brother Tom?
He loved the outdoors and he loved 

125
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:56,690
animals.
And then I went on after the breeze,

126
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,550
I go farther.
I don't want to be,

127
00:04:58,551 --> 00:04:59,500
you know,
impolite.

128
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,180
But my,
my brother liked to kill animals.

129
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,620
There's a lot of deer right now in the 
woods going,

130
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,270
whoo,
whoo.

131
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,380
Upstate New York.
So very dear rich place.

132
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:14,510
People don't have a lot of tolerance.
So those animals,

133
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,570
a lot of them,
that car accident,

134
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,503
well,
there's a lot and there's more now than 

135
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:22,580
when I was a kid.
But when,

136
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:23,091
uh,
you know,

137
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:24,050
Tony Vee,
Boston,

138
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,990
so tony,
I went up to visit my brother.

139
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,040
I had given him some money to buy some 
windows for his house.

140
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,270
It's a long story,
but he lived,

141
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,830
this is what he's really out in the 
woods.

142
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,970
And uh,
we pull up to his yard and there's just,

143
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:38,804
um,
there's just corn growing like there's 

144
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:42,404
no rows.
It's his whole front and backyard of 

145
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:46,460
corn.
Like there's like psycho corn,

146
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,110
there's no rows or anything.
Right.

147
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,393
And uh,
and Tony didn't know my brother and he 

148
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:52,341
comes out and he goes,
hey,

149
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:53,710
what's,
what's up with the corn?

150
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,580
He's like,
ah,

151
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,150
as far as the dear bobby,
you know,

152
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,800
he's like,
and Tony's like,

153
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,790
oh,
you help them through the winter.

154
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,331
It's like,
no,

155
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:03,710
I'm going to blast them.
My brother actually made us,

156
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,970
he just switched your house?
Yeah.

157
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,370
Oh,
that's so fucked up.

158
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,070
And I go,
I'm in the matthew,

159
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,933
even the new windows cracked and I go,
tell me what happened to this new 

160
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,620
windows you have bob,
you had a little problem with recoil.

161
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,910
So my brother and we sit on the toilet 
and shoot deer.

162
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,040
Swear to God,
swear to God.

163
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm sure he's probably burned in one,
two.

164
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,070
You can't take any shit.
You want to go hunt and you know,

165
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,870
meet me in the kitchen,
you know,

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,513
and then then one time him,
his family and his friends got really 

167
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:39,194
high and they,
they just turn this a station wagon and 

168
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:47,740
doing convertible with the Helios 
torches and they would use that.

169
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,800
That was their hunting will be and shoot
out of it.

170
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,860
Oh my God.
Yeah,

171
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:55,610
yeah.
Oh,

172
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,050
I wrapped this part of the story,
so,

173
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,330
so,
so tony,

174
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,720
he's going,
you'd brothers certify,

175
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:01,550
but like you said,
we're going around my brother.

176
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,360
So he goes,
Tony,

177
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,553
Tony,
and I get back in the car and we're 

178
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:08,204
heading to the car and Tony sees this 
woodchuck across the street until he 

179
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:11,960
goes,
what is that?

180
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,340
And [inaudible] to chucky with chuck.
And then,

181
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,174
um,
and then we're not even down the end of 

182
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:21,630
the driveway and we have Tony's going.

183
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,430
I just figured that would shut yo,
man,

184
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,330
that would just dead.
You drop the dime on that.

185
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:31,760
We'll check you fingered that would 
check that.

186
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,850
What is his family is going to go papa,
papa coming through the door.

187
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,380
Yeah,
my brother,

188
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,790
uh,
you know,

189
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,073
God rest his soul.
He was a wild man while he was a sheet 

190
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,520
metal worker and uh,
you know,

191
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,380
he rode bikes for a long time.
He was always a,

192
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,214
you know,
there was always our home when I was a 

193
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:54,800
kid was like,
you know,

194
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,950
the movie mask and it was just always 
bikes.

195
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,160
Motor clubs will come over to the house 
and keg parties and stuff like that.

196
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,170
Whoa.
Yeah.

197
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,373
Yeah.
It helped me to go to the big foot 

198
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,223
conference.
No.

199
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,250
So that's what I grew up with.
You know,

200
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,550
guys name like low life and all these 
guys.

201
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,380
And My mother was great because they 
would come in,

202
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,640
you know,
uh,

203
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,850
my mother was sweet because she would 
know,

204
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,240
only know their,
you know,

205
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,583
their biker names.

206
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,340
Yeah.
And he's like,

207
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,850
hello shithead.
Yeah,

208
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,010
exactly.
It would be like low life.

209
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,710
Showed up with a shirt that said 
Harley's the best fucked her ass.

210
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,930
And he's like low life,
not in my house.

211
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,300
So I was a GE and they had turned the 
shirt or not.

212
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,143
Yeah.
So I grew up with bikers and it wasn't 

213
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,020
until later on I realized,
Oh,

214
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:40,580
you know,
some bikers aren't Rad.

215
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,550
You know what I mean?
Like you know,

216
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,410
oh I see.
I mean like I'm,

217
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:45,101
I saw him,
I'd be like,

218
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:45,771
Hey,
how are you?

219
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:47,530
Like you're a nice guy,
so useless to me.

220
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,970
They're always nice being like cool,
fun.

221
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,220
And my brother had a lot of clout in 
that world.

222
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,750
So yes,
everyone was cool.

223
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,280
But then later on I was like,
oh some of these guys aren't so awesome.

224
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,070
But so basically bikers are like bears 
at the dump.

225
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:03,480
Like they look cool but stay in the car 
or New York case.

226
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,613
I had an idea that I forgot.
I know and you're not going to go with 

227
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,850
it,
but it reminds me of a,

228
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,713
I was,
cause I was reading people's tweets in 

229
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,280
there.
I asking what am I up to next,

230
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,420
you know,
for the next movie.

231
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,730
But there was a movie I wrote that I 
even thought of you,

232
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,970
but I know you don't act in everything 
and I don't even walk on it.

233
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,200
Yeah,
you won't do it.

234
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,030
But I it is it,
you won't do it.

235
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,560
I won't do it.
Well I don't know,

236
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,050
but it's not an alcoholic clown.
No,

237
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:28,710
no,
no,

238
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,730
no,
no.

239
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,760
It's a gay billy Jack Movies.
Cause Cause,

240
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,600
cause I love Billy Jack.
Come on man.

241
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,240
Come on man.
This would be perfect for,

242
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,270
you don't have to fuck anybody to blind.

243
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,680
Well it's,
I'll tasteful,

244
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:51,570
but it's like I'm from the guy who shot 
a baby on camera and a movie.

245
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,350
It's all tasteful.
So,

246
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,810
um,
no,

247
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,760
it's um,
uh,

248
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,223
I was,
I was married at the time and I said to 

249
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:00,391
my wife,
I go,

250
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,550
I'm tired of being broke.
I'm going to write a genre picture.

251
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,440
I Love Billy Jack Movies when I was a 
kid.

252
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,783
Uh,
so I started writing it and I was about 

253
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:09,900
40 pages in and she's like,
how's it going?

254
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,890
I'm like,
well,

255
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,220
he's gay now.
And she goes,

256
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,860
so I'm just going to keep renting.
We're not going to get a home.

257
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:18,211
I got,
yeah,

258
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,110
pretty much.
So,

259
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:19,944
uh,
and uh,

260
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,930
and I,
and I was talking to Gus van Zant.

261
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:22,830
I said,
I want to write a,

262
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,570
uh,
an action film.

263
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,463
You know,
like if you were 13 year old gay boy be 

264
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:29,760
the coolest movie you saw besides the 
300,

265
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:32,440
you know,
and so,

266
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,350
so,
so he's,

267
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,420
it's just classic Billy Jack,
you know,

268
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,370
he goes into the buyer,
he's tried to have a drink,

269
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,204
redneck town.

270
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,080
He's like,
hey fag.

271
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:40,914
He's like,
I'm going to have to ask you to stop 

272
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:42,880
using that word.
He's like,

273
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,300
Oh God,
what are you going to do?

274
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,163
Well,
I'm going to shatter his knee cap and 

275
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:53,340
I'm going to,
I'm going to shatter your wind pipe.

276
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:53,731
Or,
you know,

277
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:56,010
it goes through the whole list and you 
want to know something.

278
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:58,050
There's not a goddamn thing you can do 
about it.

279
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,640
And then it says,
and he does.

280
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,830
And then he goes back,
he kicks ass.

281
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,843
It goes back to the bar,
finishes that drink that he was trying 

282
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:07,980
to drink and puts it down.
And he says to the bartering,

283
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:08,814
cause he's a decent man.
Is there a decent place for a man to 

284
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,334
stay in this town?
And then it cuts and he's in bed with 

285
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,460
that dude.
Oh God.

286
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,050
Come on Joe.
Come on Joe.

287
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,260
Come on.
Well,

288
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,780
I mean,
look at brokeback mountain.

289
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,780
I mean,
it was essentially like a cowboy romance

290
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,210
twist to me.
It had all the elements of her,

291
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:32,400
like a regular cowboy romance.
And I wanted this to be like,

292
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,400
to me the political,
yeah,

293
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,620
right.
It was triumph.

294
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:37,210
I don't even know you had a trial.
Yeah.

295
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,290
Well,
but I was thinking about,

296
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,163
do you remember Jay Leno?
Did you remember to Jack and Jay Leno 

297
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,870
would wear it's beautiful flower.
It makes me want to go nuts.

298
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,040
So,
uh,

299
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,490
but I,
I wanted them to have the bike that,

300
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:59,070
uh,
you remember then King Bronson,

301
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,913
you're younger than me.
You wouldn't remember it then came 

302
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:01,481
Brian.
Yeah,

303
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:02,580
he was bad ass.
He,

304
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:03,414
he,
uh,

305
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,330
he,
uh,

306
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,270
was kind of the forerunner to,
to,

307
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,450
to Billy Jack.
It was a TV show and uh,

308
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:11,600
yeah,
he,

309
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,980
uh,
there you go.

310
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,820
He was,
uh,

311
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,840
a reporter that got fed up and then he 
just drove around and kicked as this.

312
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,340
See,
I'm going to have the triangle,

313
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,690
but it's not going to be the,
yeah.

314
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,820
It's not going to be that.
That's a sweet bike.

315
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,110
Yeah.
Right in that rat.

316
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,513
But I'm just going to have,
but he's got the Illuminati on his 

317
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:29,830
painting.
He's got the aluminum.

318
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:33,130
I'm just going to have a pink triangle 
instead of the Illuminati Illuminati.

319
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,790
Look at that,
you know,

320
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,520
but he was bad.
Um,

321
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,920
my brother was really into thinking 
Branson.

322
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,080
I love motorcycles.
I'm just scared of crashing.

323
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,010
Yeah,
well you can't,

324
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,480
well,
I mean you can't have him here,

325
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,750
but it's all dangerous.
Yeah.

326
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,520
Yeah.
I know.

327
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
If I live somewhere like real quiet,
oh sure man.

328
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,050
Sit or getting one,
like awesome.

329
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,280
And that's like,
yeah.

330
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,350
And growing up in central New York,
you could do that,

331
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:54,184
but not here.
Or my daughter wouldn't allow me to do 

332
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,304
that.
She would,

333
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,040
she just made it really clear.
You know,

334
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,930
there's just so much fun,
but it's just,

335
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:05,230
it doesn't seem worth the risk.
Yeah.

336
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,540
It's bad here.
So that you,

337
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,440
so you had a maniac brother.
That's,

338
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,720
so that's a lot of people's perception 
of hunters is a hunters are crazy people

339
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:15,580
that just like kimberly was just 
outside.

340
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:16,414
I mean,
yeah,

341
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,680
there are a lot of people like that 
though,

342
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:20,290
that are hunters.
Hunters want to deny,

343
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,890
but my brother also still had his 
ethics,

344
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:25,090
like he ate what?

345
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,030
He killed this guy and he's sold at,
I mean,

346
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:28,631
he,
you know,

347
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:29,830
he was a trapper.
He,

348
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:31,900
he,
he just didn't like the man.

349
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,160
I get it.
It was one time where he was eluding the

350
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,750
warden and,
um,

351
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,510
uh,
it's just,

352
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,670
it's just all this stuff.
So they took off on a lake,

353
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,690
which wasn't thought,
oh no,

354
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,840
we lost the car.
Oh No.

355
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,180
They drove on a lake,
took acid,

356
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,240
and went fishing in the swan because 
they had these big carpet in there.

357
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,863
So he's tripping balls,
which is like a public pond or 

358
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:06,800
something.
Yeah.

359
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,080
It's like where you'd go.
Yeah.

360
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,140
Take your family.
So in the moon night out for the,

361
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,310
yeah,
I remember once,

362
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,260
uh,
oh,

363
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,140
what was that guy's name?
Big Mitch.

364
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:22,141
We W I went to an almond brothers 
concert when I was like 12 and Mitch had

365
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,690
been the nom and he was tripping and he 
was totally,

366
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,950
he was seeing Charlie in the parking lot
while he's driving the car.

367
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,030
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

368
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,780
Oh my God.
Yeah.

369
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,660
So that was my upbringing.
Wow.

370
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,450
So we got on this from hunters.
Um,

371
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,581
you know,
it's funny,

372
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:49,720
I'm,
I'm Vegan,

373
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:53,780
but I have more respect for people that 
actually kill the animal,

374
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,100
which would eat eggs from my,
I'm not anymore.

375
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,963
I mean I did for a long time,
but I'm not like a opposed to other 

376
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:03,110
people doing it.
And I actually,

377
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,123
I'm not trying to kiss your ass.
I have respect for people to kill it 

378
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:07,280
because then they're not removed from 
it.

379
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,860
You know what I mean?
There's this weird thing when you just,

380
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,280
you know that,
that's the weird part to me.

381
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,363
Well it's,
it's uh,

382
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,030
well it's dark because you don't know 
where it came from.

383
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:17,864
So that's sort of,
it reduces your responsibility and you 

384
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:25,190
don't really have to look into where the
man from.

385
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,040
And then that's where factory farming 
comes from him because we're,

386
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,260
we're sort of ignorant to it.

387
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,280
And I grew up eating game venison where 
there's seven people in the family.

388
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,374
So why wouldn't you eat eggs?
Cause you don't like the idea of 

389
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:41,560
chickens and captivity or you don't want
them for health reasons.

390
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,020
I just stopped eating m and a it,
you know,

391
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:47,200
I had a heart attack a little bit a 
while ago and,

392
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:50,060
and part of it's funny,
when I got off of that stuff,

393
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,690
everything,
my heart's in great shape,

394
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,470
which when I had the heart attack,
I knew I wasn't dying.

395
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,910
And I've truly,
it just recently done in May,

396
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:01,670
I was thinking about it.
The,

397
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
my,
my thoughts weren't like,

398
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,610
oh I'm going to die.
My thought was I'm going to have to lose

399
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,590
weight.
I was really angry.

400
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:13,370
I'm going to have to work out.
I was like furious over that idea.

401
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,780
That's fine.
I mean,

402
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,920
we talked about this,
that stage,

403
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,370
but it's true.

404
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,203
One of,
uh,

405
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,970
[inaudible] like after a few weeks of 
walking,

406
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:22,160
an hour after dinner,
I was out.

407
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:22,941
I was like,
I don't care,

408
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:23,750
you know.
But,

409
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,583
but a cat was missing in the 
neighborhood and that would motivate me 

410
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:29,600
to walk.
Oh to look for the cat.

411
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,180
I was going to find it.
There's no missing cats.

412
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,830
Yeah,
I know was coyote.

413
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,173
But I found a cat that I thought was the
cat and then I carried it about maybe a 

414
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,730
quarter of a mile back to the telephone.
Paul,

415
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:43,820
who's the wrong cat?
Yeah.

416
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:46,370
And I'm still a cat.
This is all to bring it back.

417
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,151
Yeah.
Cause yeah,

418
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,120
I love animals.
So I,

419
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,273
so I brought it to the house where I 
thought it lived at and then I knocked 

420
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:56,330
on this woman's door and I did.
And then she opened the door and the cat

421
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:58,310
ran and I swear to God and then the 
woman goes,

422
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,800
she looks left and right and he goes,
Huh?

423
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,591
It goes in like,
oh,

424
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:04,060
I guess the cat's not going on the 
doing.

425
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,630
And then I just didn't know you were 
there.

426
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,040
No,
cause I didn't want to go,

427
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,650
hey,
I think I stole your cash.

428
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,610
Thought the fucking cat knocked on my 
door.

429
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,480
I call bullshit.
Because they have furry little knuckles.

430
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,080
She wouldn't hear it.
Well when I let my cat out,

431
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,590
he will me out cause I don't let them 
out for long periods of time.

432
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,453
But I'll let him out during the day.
If you want to wander around the yard 

433
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,430
cause he'll just hang around in the 
house.

434
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,740
But I worry about hawks hawks or,
yeah,

435
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,110
we have coyote and I'm in my back yard 
and I live in silver lake.

436
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,370
Yeah.
Cartoons are everywhere.

437
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,860
They're all throughout the entire 50 
states.

438
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,580
If there's,
if you're interested in the,

439
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,553
the history of the coyote,
there's an amazing podcast called the 

440
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,770
mediator.
It's by this Guy Steve,

441
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,250
and he interviews

442
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,350
this Guy Dan Flores,
who's a historian,

443
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,783
wildlife historian.
He's a professor and he wrote a book 

444
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,300
recently on coyotes.
Coyotes were originally,

445
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,153
um,
only western animals and they used to 

446
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,670
call them prairie wolves.
That's what they used to call them.

447
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,950
They're actually a type of wolf.
It's a small wolf.

448
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,813
Wow.
And when people started hunting coyotes 

449
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,324
kit and killing coyotes,
and then reintroducing gray wolves into 

450
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,140
like yellowstone park and all sorts of 
areas in Idaho and North America,

451
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,243
that's when the coyote spread across the
entire range of the continental United 

452
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,100
States.
Now there's coyotes in every city in the

453
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:26,430
country.

454
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,263
Yeah.
There's coyotes in the adirondacks in 

455
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,634
New York.

456
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,710
We'll have more babies.
This is what's crazy.

457
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,590
Like when you hear coyote screaming at 
900,

458
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,153
what they're doing is like roll call 
apparently according to this Dan Flores 

459
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,363
God,
and they call out and when there's less 

460
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:44,410
response,
like when one of them is missing,

461
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,740
it triggers a response in the female to 
have larger litters.

462
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,720
Wow.
Significantly larger.

463
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,960
That crying is the equivalent of 
Bueller.

464
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,843
Yeah,
exactly.

465
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,193
Exactly.
So they had apparently us a number of 

466
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:02,530
coyotes that they had estimated in 
yellowstone.

467
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,483
Then they brought in the gray wolves.
And the gray wolves are different than 

468
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:06,754
red wolves and a couple other wolves 
that are pretty much stet stayed and 

469
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,270
steady,
uh,

470
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,450
population numbers in North America.
Well,

471
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:16,090
when the gray wolves came back in North 
America,

472
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:19,030
they didn't treat coyotes like,
like friends.

473
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:21,730
They killed them.
And so when they started killing them as

474
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:24,370
opposed to interbreeding with them,
like you've heard of a Koi Wolf,

475
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,830
do you know what that is?
That's a big thing on the east coast,

476
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,440
which mostly red wolves and coyotes are 
breeding.

477
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,423
They creating a larger,
smarter coyote and it's because the 

478
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:35,500
coyote is really our wolves.
So when they started doing this,

479
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,363
they killed 50% of the coyote.
The coyote population dropped down to 

480
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:39,814
50%.
But then because they have larger 

481
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:42,970
litters,
when one of them gets killed,

482
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,720
now it's ramped up in 20 years higher 
than it was before.

483
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:47,860
The reintroduction of the wolves.

484
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,820
Well,
um,

485
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,120
survivor matt and I have to say,
I mean they're,

486
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,030
they're creepy.
Uh,

487
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,990
when you see them,
the way they move,

488
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,120
they,
I've seen when I saw one scale,

489
00:19:59,121 --> 00:19:59,954
a wall,
like just climb over and killed one of 

490
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:04,610
my chickens,
I saw it run over a wall with my chicken

491
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:06,700
six foot wall and they climb.
It was nothing.

492
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,521
Yeah,
it's weird.

493
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:08,354
Like,
uh,

494
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,840
it's like human in the way it walks.
Superintelligent.

495
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,960
Yeah.
But I have to say I as scary as they are

496
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:15,711
and all that,
I,

497
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,540
there's a part of me that goes,
sorry man,

498
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,920
I know I'm in your yard.
You know what I mean?

499
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,090
I,
I,

500
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,000
I,
I realized that,

501
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,230
you know,
I'm the intruder,

502
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:25,064
you know,
really,

503
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,110
really?
No,

504
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,461
no,
no.

505
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,190
Don't feel that about coyotes.
No,

506
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,540
no.
Because look,

507
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,820
they go where the food is.
We go where the food is.

508
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:34,350
We're all sharing the space together.
It's not there.

509
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,890
It's not ours.
It's just weird now.

510
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,880
I mean,
you see this,

511
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,420
you say it's a wolf.
I see a wolf in my backyard,

512
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,090
but they hang around where people are 
because that why?

513
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:46,410
Because we were way off.
Yeah.

514
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,020
We're the food as so where the road in

515
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,470
Sar because we have a lot of trash.
Yeah.

516
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,180
They're really important because they 
kill off all the rats.

517
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,440
That's really important.
Yeah.

518
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,750
They kill the rats.
They kill rabbits.

519
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:57,670
They kill a lot of things that would get
out of hand,

520
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,050
uh,
population wise.

521
00:20:59,051 --> 00:20:59,884
If it wasn't for them.

522
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,600
I,
uh,

523
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,530
yeah.
I don't let,

524
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,100
I don't let Anderson Cooper out or,
or Alice Cooper,

525
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:07,270
those are my cats.
Yeah.

526
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,430
Not during the day for sure.
I just,

527
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,770
I or not at night.
Excuse me.

528
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:11,730
Yeah.
I'm not going to let him out.

529
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,020
You just don't do it at all.
Nah,

530
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,230
Nah.
You know,

531
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,030
I,
I think that actually reminds me of it.

532
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,360
I don't know if I want to tell that 
story.

533
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,110
I was going to tell him I have a woman 
leftover,

534
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,080
a whip at my house.
Yeah.

535
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,943
Whip it.
Good.

536
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,751
Yeah.
And,

537
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:28,331
and,
and,

538
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:30,880
and I have to say that like,
I wasn't like,

539
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:33,010
I don't think I'm a prude,
but,

540
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,260
and she's a very sweet person,
but she was like,

541
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,830
I know where she was going,
obviously.

542
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,200
Yeah.
And well,

543
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,400
she surprised me with it.
And so,

544
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,650
yeah,
I don't know was like that.

545
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,040
I don't know.
You know,

546
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,290
that's not my thing.

547
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,880
I don't have any crops,
but,

548
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,480
um,
no.

549
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,660
So here's the thing.
Like I,

550
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,840
I make this joke,
which drew,

551
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,260
I retired from acting the same time.
People stopped hiring me.

552
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,120
But no,
I really don't like to act.

553
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,200
I understand how you,
it's,

554
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,840
it's,
it's,

555
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,610
I don't like it.
I don't like it either.

556
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,200
And no one believes you when you say 
that.

557
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,034
Yeah.
They think you're just think you're 

558
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:12,040
lying and they think I'm lying.
I love directing.

559
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,990
I love writing.
I love being behind the scenes.

560
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:16,290
I love making stuff.
I like doing standup,

561
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,950
but I,
I think it's hard.

562
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,660
Back in the day when,
you know,

563
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,260
when I was in movies going,
I mean that wasn't acting,

564
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:24,310
you know,
if I forgot a line,

565
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,920
come on,
let's go.

566
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:28,870
You know,
so I don't know if that was acting,

567
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:30,910
but,
but she was like,

568
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,350
ah,
this.

569
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,850
So when she said,
she said,

570
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:35,980
I like to be dominated.
So that meant now,

571
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,170
um,
I have an acting part,

572
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,500
you know what I mean?
I like to be done and I'm like,

573
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,610
line,
I'm sorry,

574
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:46,910
I'm not a book.
You know,

575
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,490
and this sounds very almost borscht 
belt,

576
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:52,570
but I did say that.
She goes,

577
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,880
she goes,
I've been a bad girl.

578
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:56,530
And I,
I said,

579
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:57,910
um,
well,

580
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:58,780
we're all flawed.

581
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,230
It's like a woody allen.
My,

582
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:04,390
yeah,
I did say that.

583
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,520
And then we laughed.
And I would just rather,

584
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,901
uh,
let's,

585
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,150
let's have sex.
Let's not,

586
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,270
I don't want to,
yeah,

587
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm that way too.
I'm not in a choking anybody.

588
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,440
Well with you that would,
I just,

589
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,090
I just don't,
I mean it takes on a whole nother level.

590
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,183
Yes,

591
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,380
I bet.
I just put them,

592
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,760
I just,
I don't get the connection.

593
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,040
I mean I get where someone could get the
connection.

594
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,750
You know,
I was talking to a friend of mine,

595
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,200
my friend Chris Ryan who wrote this book
a sex at dawn,

596
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,560
he's a professor or a phd and he's a 
really interesting guy.

597
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,603
And he was talking about where people 
get fetishes from and then when you're 

598
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:42,060
sort of imprinted at a young age,
as you're going through puberty,

599
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,920
sometimes very odd things will happen 
and those things will happen.

600
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:49,610
You'll connect those things because they
happened with you sexually and they sort

601
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:52,640
of imprint in your system.
And he used it as a,

602
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:53,474
and as an example of how someone could 
get their dick sucked by a guy when 

603
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:00,680
they're like 13 or 14 and not even be 
gay,

604
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,780
but really like getting your Dick sucked
by.

605
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:06,560
Guys like you get turned on by like guys
sucking guys dicks or something.

606
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:09,620
Like you can actually like imprint in 
your mind,

607
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,573
but meanwhile you're attracted to women,
but you have this like weird kink for 

608
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,410
this one thing.
It's very strange.

609
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,670
But give me an example of other ones.
I mean,

610
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,740
then,
yeah,

611
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,250
how's that way?
Why would you,

612
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,380
why would you get in the feet?
I don't know.

613
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:25,380
Like somebody rubbed their feet on you,
like right before you had sex.

614
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,020
Like some girl rubbed her feet on your 
Dick and was into it,

615
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,640
you know,
and just playing around.

616
00:24:29,641 --> 00:24:30,560
And I mean,
that does,

617
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:32,130
it can happen.
I mean,

618
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:32,964
I'm sure anything can happen.
Obviously there's things going on 

619
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:35,904
between like a person like you or I who 
doesn't want to hit anybody with a whip 

620
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,870
and someone who's like really into it.
Yeah.

621
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,100
Also though,
I mean,

622
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,110
yeah,
there is something different to happen,

623
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,380
but it's not like I'm like,
oh,

624
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:50,820
that's disgusting and weird.
It just doesn't do anything for me.

625
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,760
It's not,
it just takes me out of the game.

626
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,663
Yeah.
Yeah.

627
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,480
Why don't I just,
I don't ever want to

628
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,343
associate sex and violence together.
I just don't think that's a good 

629
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:01,480
combination.
In My,

630
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,990
my world,
I don't like it,

631
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,780
but I get it.
Like I have a buddy of mine who,

632
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:06,614
him and his girlfriend,
they put ball gags on each other and 

633
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:10,100
beat the shit out of each other and they
love each other.

634
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,153
Yeah.
Great.

635
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,030
I mean,
they don't really,

636
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,010
they don't come away marked or anything 
like that,

637
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,740
but there's some hair Poland and some 
smacking around.

638
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,460
Well,
but,

639
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,080
but you're,
but you're a fighter,

640
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,140
you know what I mean?
So you know what I mean?

641
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:29,820
So it's to the,
it's like it's,

642
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,110
it's ruining something you love.
Yes.

643
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,780
Oh yeah.
I guess in that way.

644
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,800
Different things in your mind

645
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,420
sort of.
But the way I look at that,

646
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,260
I don't see like that's the kind of 
violence was like,

647
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:45,011
someone's like,
hit me,

648
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:48,430
I want you to hit me.
Like that is not martial arts.

649
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,380
So like,
you know what I'm saying?

650
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,214
Yeah.
I know that's not remotely the same 

651
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:53,914
thing.
Even if it's not even connected with 

652
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:55,684
sex.
I don't want have anything to do with 

653
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:58,810
that.
Like the idea of martial arts is someone

654
00:25:58,811 --> 00:26:01,240
doesn't want to be hit.
You're trying to hit them and it becomes

655
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:03,790
this crazy game with extreme 
consequences,

656
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:07,830
extreme health consequences.
There's nothing that's,

657
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,733
that's so different than holding someone
down with a rape joke and just smacking 

658
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:12,954
him in the face over and over again 
until they start crying while you're 

659
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:16,234
fucking them.
Like people are into weird shit like 

660
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:19,654
that and I,
my brain doesn't understand those 

661
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:23,830
connections,
but some people do.

662
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,663
Like that guy,
the CBC radio host in Canada that had 

663
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:29,314
all these girls saying that he just was 
into beaten him up and he would say he 

664
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:33,970
wants to have rough sex and they 
thought,

665
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:34,481
you know,
hey,

666
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:35,314
it'd be a little hair.
Poland spank me when he's punching him 

667
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:39,370
in the face and shit.
You know,

668
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,080
I allegedly,
I mean,

669
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:44,040
I dunno who's apparently he the trial,
right?

670
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,580
They dismissed the case and so now 
they're going to retry him,

671
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,180
I guess under some other case or other 
people.

672
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,080
There's,
I mean,

673
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,943
then yeah,
there was some lying apparently by the 

674
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:55,494
girls and also they had 5,000 text 
messages between the two of them going 

675
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:00,624
back and forth about the details of the 
case and what they should say and what 

676
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:05,430
they shouldn't say.
So obviously there was some collusion.

677
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,270
Obviously there was some deception or 
allegedly some deception,

678
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,250
but,
but what the fuck is it?

679
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:14,010
And this guy was like identified as a 
male feminist.

680
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,350
He was like mister soft spook in.
Yeah,

681
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,900
but you're liberal.
But that's true.

682
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That's actually a crown drop is this 
really recently.

683
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,050
Okay,
so he signed a peace bond in the crown,

684
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,450
drops a sexual assault case.
What does that mean?

685
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,820
What does a peace bond?
Some Canadian shit.

686
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,763
What does a peace bond click on that 
common and critical Cesa first 

687
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,120
highlighted up at the top.
Yeah,

688
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:39,954
there you go.

689
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,130
What does a peace bond?
They're fairly common in criminal cases.

690
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:44,964
Defense lawyer says,
but that poor guy lost like 10 years of 

691
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:49,830
his life through his whole thing.
Peace Bond isn't usual.

692
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,580
Is isn't unusual as a way to resolve a 
criminal case as a lawyer.

693
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:56,560
In the wake of the news that former CBC 
broadcast or John Gomez,

694
00:27:56,561 --> 00:28:00,840
she is expected to sign one to conclude 
his second sexual assault case.

695
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,183
A source who did not want to be 
identified told CBC News of the case 

696
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:06,600
will not go to trial in June as 
previously scheduled.

697
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,434
Instead,
the charges is expect to be dealt with 

698
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,000
on Wednesday.
The incident is alleged to have happened

699
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,980
in 2008 counselors.
Counselors,

700
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:17,010
cases are resolved via a peace bond.
I don't know what the fuck that means.

701
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,830
A resolution.
What does a peace plan?

702
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,610
It's still not saying.
Yeah.

703
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:22,860
I'm not sure.
He's an odd dude though,

704
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,570
because he was like,
Mister,

705
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,300
Mister liberal classic.

706
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:27,841
Yeah,
right.

707
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:30,190
Those clash.
Yeah.

708
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,063
I've,
I'm,

709
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,100
there's,
oh,

710
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,980
there's those guys,
those guys,

711
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:38,610
but you know how many of those guys have
rage issues?

712
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,350
Do you know what I mean?
That that,

713
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,070
that real,
there's so many of that.

714
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:48,410
Folks like these hippie folks and they 
have this rage.

715
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,780
It's just really strange.
It's,

716
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,933
yeah,
it's not,

717
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,760
well also I find that a lot of guys who 
identify as male feminists,

718
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,760
what happened for a lot of them is 
they're there.

719
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,310
They had rough childhoods and they were 
rejected by women.

720
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,810
So they become this like savior of women
from all these other asshole ish men.

721
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,663
Right.
And so they become the guy that's 

722
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:10,410
different.
But they're womanizers.

723
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:11,244
Yeah,
it's not even that they're womanizers 

724
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,013
what they are is they just a guy but 
there a weak guy and they're suffering 

725
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:19,530
from the trauma of like,
I have a friend,

726
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,393
it's not a friend anymore,
but I had a friend when I was younger 

727
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,860
who had,
he was,

728
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,840
he wasn't an attractive guy and he would
have real issues with women,

729
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:28,470
not like him.

730
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,560
He would get so upset.
And he started,

731
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,290
over the course of the six or seven 
years I knew him,

732
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,513
he started associating women with pain.
Like they would reject him and they 

733
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:42,130
would be mean to him.
And he was going all the wrong places,

734
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:43,680
like going to like,
you know,

735
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,260
hotspots and getting bottle service and 
you know,

736
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,310
and that was the type of people you're 
attracting.

737
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,353
And so they just wanted to have his 
drinks and not wanna have sex with him 

738
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:56,971
and he would associate women with,
with pain and frustration and rejection.

739
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,353
And so he started becoming this angry 
guy and I watched this sort of 

740
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,130
metamorphosis and I,
and I,

741
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:05,240
and I was trying to analyze it like,
you know,

742
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,930
I was trying to do like the Louis Leakey
anthropology thing.

743
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,033
I'm trying to figure out what the fuck 
is causing this stress and pain and 

744
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:12,910
anger.

745
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,280
And it's just purely as association 
game.

746
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,383
It's like how some people start looking 
at Hollywood like Hollywood's all 

747
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:19,350
bullshit,
man.

748
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,500
I'm tired as fuck.
Why?

749
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,260
Well because you keep going to the 
auditions and they keep turning it down.

750
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,640
Right?
And so you just decide,

751
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:26,290
well fuck this place man.
It's places fake.

752
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,483
But meanwhile,
if you got scooped up when you're 20 

753
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,680
years old,
yeah,

754
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,340
yeah,
you would love this place.

755
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,490
It'd be the guy at the red carpet.
You would be like the toast of the town,

756
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,473
you'd be so happy.
And so I think a lot of these guys that 

757
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,470
identify as male feminists,
I think they're just pussies.

758
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,140
And what happened is when they were 
young,

759
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:48,870
they got walked over,
they got trampled,

760
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,713
and they're trying to figure out what is
the pattern of behavior that I have to 

761
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:53,824
follow for me to separate myself from 
these men that have ruined these girls' 

762
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:58,234
lives.
I know I'll offer myself up as the 

763
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:01,780
solution.
And as a feminist,

764
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:04,180
I just feel like it's just really been 
fucked over.

765
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,230
Well.
But I mean,

766
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,860
there's a couple of things I run into 
the other guys who,

767
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:11,630
uh,
crimmins has it term,

768
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,260
uh,
feminized,

769
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,760
who are,
who are acting,

770
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:19,050
I'll sensitive but still pulling mad.
Well,

771
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,600
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

772
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:22,360
He's like,
I understand it.

773
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,680
The same guy,
the same guy.

774
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,170
Different Hustle.
Yeah,

775
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,170
exactly.
Yeah.

776
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,510
Feminizing and uh,
uh,

777
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,590
but you know,
I mean,

778
00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:33,140
at the end of the day,
feminist,

779
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:33,781
it's,
it's,

780
00:31:33,781 --> 00:31:34,980
you know,
basic human rights.

781
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:37,230
I'm all for that.
Of course.

782
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,183
I just,
the problem is that the definition and 

783
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:42,730
the [inaudible] and those guys who,
uh,

784
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,670
uh,
I questioned there.

785
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,000
Integrity.
Yes.

786
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,910
Well,
men are very difficult in that regard.

787
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,560
It's very difficult while they're 
sexually viable because they,

788
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,480
they're looking for attention,
they're trying to score and when they're

789
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,314
trying to score,
they try any sort of combination of 

790
00:31:57,941 --> 00:31:58,870
words.
Right.

791
00:31:58,871 --> 00:31:59,704
It might be possible.
Like I met this one guy said he's a 

792
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:03,790
feminist and then he told me he's 
polyamorous.

793
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,110
I go,
Oh,

794
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,900
you're a pussy hat.
And I see how,

795
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,570
I just know,
I just don't want to control my woman.

796
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,240
I don't want to read.
I respect her pleasure,

797
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:17,470
her right to seek pleasure fucker.
You fucker.

798
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:21,450
I see you.
I respect her,

799
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,080
man.
I uh,

800
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,090
yeah,
I think,

801
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:25,860
um,
yeah,

802
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,300
I mean,
I don't know when the,

803
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,520
when the,

804
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,890
there's what,
when did men start becoming feminists?

805
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,290
Was it Alan Alda?
Did he pulled that shit first?

806
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,510
Uh,
no.

807
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:37,370
I think it's,
I think it's,

808
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,220
but you know,
the seventies,

809
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,690
sixties,
you just started saying it.

810
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,760
I mean,
I'm sure like Warren Beatty was,

811
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:47,200
even though I guarantee he was such a 
pussy.

812
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,590
I know,
I know.

813
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,370
I guarantee he was.
Hmm.

814
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,980
Maybe.
Maybe.

815
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:55,370
I think you know,
people don't like the term egalitarian.

816
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:57,050
They think it's a cop out like,
oh no,

817
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:57,351
no,
no.

818
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,610
If you really cared about women's 
rights,

819
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,230
you'd identify yourself as a feminist.
Like,

820
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:00,840
no,
I'm,

821
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,500
I like humans.
Like all of them I like,

822
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,480
I like nice women.
I like Nice Ben.

823
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,120
I liked pink Barbie.
Obviously major things,

824
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:08,831
you know the,
the,

825
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:09,500
the,
the,

826
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,240
the pay gap is,
is a,

827
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,560
is a real good,
it's tricky.

828
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,410
You're looking at that.
A lot of political bullshit,

829
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,160
the actual reality pay gap.
It's very minor.

830
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,760
There's only a few jobs where women 
actually do get paid less than men.

831
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,833
What the pay gap is,
is overall judging how much money women 

832
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:29,384
make versus how much money men make and 
not taking into account what jobs they 

833
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:32,660
do.

834
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,380
What,
what,

835
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,380
what jobs men tend to gravitate towards 
naturally versus what jobs women tend to

836
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,284
gravitate towards naturally.
But when they're in the same job with 

837
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:46,400
the same sort of production there,
their actual payscale is very similar.

838
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,790
It's real tricky man because you can't 
deny that some people that are a certain

839
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,084
gender,
like they gravitate towards certain 

840
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:57,410
occupations and those occupations might 
have higher risk,

841
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,740
they might have a higher pay ceilings.
There's,

842
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:01,574
there's a lot of variables and then you 
have to take into account women taking 

843
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,860
time off for raising children,
for being pregnant,

844
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,480
all those things,
having babies,

845
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,314
maternity leave.
That all gets factored in when you're 

846
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:15,170
talking about how much time or how much 
money people actually make.

847
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,273
So if you say women should be paid 
maternity leave and they should get x 

848
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:21,734
amount of money from a corporation,
then you're dealing with a totally 

849
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:23,810
different argument.

850
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,240
And if you do that then the pay scale 
changes,

851
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,070
then it goes up a little bit.
And if you say,

852
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:32,510
well everybody should get paid for the 
same exact same exact money for the same

853
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:33,344
job.
Even still more men want to do certain 

854
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:36,914
jobs in engineering and science.
And then when it comes to like really 

855
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:41,090
dangerous jobs,
you know,

856
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,580
men are much more likely to die on the 
job.

857
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,060
Men are much more likely to be murdered 
by other men.

858
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:51,890
There's like a lot of weird shit that 
get has to get factored in when you talk

859
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:52,724
about a payscales and apparently it's 
one of those political things where 

860
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:57,134
people say it and then I it.
And then someone corrected me on it and 

861
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:01,784
then I said,
but I heard Obama say it because Obama 

862
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,034
was talking about the glass ceiling and 
how much money and the disparity in 

863
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:06,800
income.

864
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,150
And then I started actually looking into
it,

865
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:08,781
I went,
oh,

866
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:09,614
okay,
this is complicated because it's one of 

867
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,100
those things where you don't want to be 
insensitive.

868
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,930
So you don't want to say that's 
bullshit.

869
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:16,640
Women don't get paid any less than men 
do.

870
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,190
But when you actually do look at the 
real numbers,

871
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,030
that's where they're getting it from.
It's not like there's a hundred lawyers.

872
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,650
Okay.
Let's use an example about,

873
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,440
uh,
in,

874
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,273
in,
in,

875
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,650
in Showbiz.
Cause,

876
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:28,710
uh,
you,

877
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,680
there is a,
a big difference an actresses and actors

878
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,380
pays.
Are there your top actors?

879
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,333
Well,
the people that can sell the most 

880
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:40,290
tickets,
you get the most money.

881
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,560
Like Jennifer Lawrence gets paid shit,
piles of money.

882
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,513
And there was that thing where she was 
saying that she was upset that she 

883
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:47,250
didn't get as which one is Bradley 
Cooper,

884
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,100
but Bradley Cooper was in way more 
scenes than her.

885
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,610
He was in way more of the movie and he 
was a bigger star at the time.

886
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,923
Like it's,
it's real tricky because of Jennifer 

887
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,550
Lawrence was in a movie with you.
She get paid way more than you.

888
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,440
Well,
let's be,

889
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,380
you know what I'm saying?
Or I probably would pull more money,

890
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:07,110
but,
but you know what I'm saying,

891
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,993
right.
It's like if someone is a huge 

892
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:10,310
superstar,
um,

893
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,930
uh,
what's her name from friends?

894
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,330
Jennifer Aniston.
Jennifer Aniston in her prime,

895
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,950
you know,
or,

896
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:17,784
um,

897
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,090
the Matt and Mike and Molly Guy.
What's the girl's name?

898
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,190
Miss Melissa.
Melissa McCarthy.

899
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,960
Yeah.
You don't think she makes more than him?

900
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,730
Of course she does.
She's more popular.

901
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,160
She's more famous.
She does these giant movies.

902
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,550
She gets paid tons of money.
Amy Schumer gets paid tons of money.

903
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,340
And I'm going to just change the 
subject,

904
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,273
uh,
cause I was thinking of back to your 

905
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:40,790
bears and movies.
What was your take on revenue?

906
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,620
I liked it.
You know,

907
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:45,090
it's all based on an actual true story 
that uh,

908
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,983
this Guy Steve Rinella from that 
mediator podcast who actually a 

909
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:50,720
historian himself in a way,
he told me the story,

910
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:52,790
the actual story where,
um,

911
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,683
they really did leave this guy for dead 
and he really did crawl for a couple of 

912
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,330
miles and figured out a way to survive 
and got to that guy and killed them.

913
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,900
It's a real true story.
Um,

914
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,140
I thought it was pretty good,
man.

915
00:37:03,141 --> 00:37:04,160
It's three.
It's really interesting.

916
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:04,994
I mean,
someone who's actually been relatively 

917
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:09,680
close to a wild bear,
what did you make of the scenes?

918
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:11,900
People do see it looked really 
realistic.

919
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:14,930
People do occasionally survive bear 
attacks like that.

920
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,973
Cause a lot of times the bears are just 
trying to protect themselves or they're 

921
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,470
trying to protect her because you fuck 
up.

922
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,630
You get to close their cubs that that's 
a lot of it.

923
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,680
Yeah.
That's the thing,

924
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,543
uh,
about bears is that you may not know 

925
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:29,690
that you're between the cub.
Yeah.

926
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:31,160
You might not have any idea.
Yeah.

927
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,780
You gotta be super careful and if you're
worried about you,

928
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,900
I know what I'm doing.
I mean,

929
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:40,280
there's,
there's a certain amount of risk.

930
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,980
There's a certain amount of risk.
Last one is no,

931
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,270
watch me.
I know what I'm doing.

932
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:45,650
I don't,
let me try this.

933
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,440
I don't go where grizzlies are.
Stay with the black bears are like,

934
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,053
if I do see a grizzly,
we're fucking out of there pretty 

935
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:53,780
quickly.
You gotta you gotta be careful,

936
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:55,370
but there's a certain amount of risk to 
it.

937
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,830
Did you see grizzly man?
Yeah.

938
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,970
Yeah.
Many times.

939
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,390
I always want to for the bears.
Yeah.

940
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:02,031
Yeah.
Okay,

941
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:02,510
great.
Yeah,

942
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,100
I was the same thing as I go there.

943
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,113
That's an interesting case because that 
guy is obviously mentally allianced 

944
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,263
willow creek,
probably more than any other movie 

945
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,570
really will,
if people haven't seen it.

946
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:15,404
It's Bob's bigfoot movie,
which we're going to get back to big 

947
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:18,920
foot.
Well,

948
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,763
when Willow Creek came out,
I was in the middle of my big flip 

949
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,450
phase.
Yeah,

950
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,760
it was,
it was just ending.

951
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,390
And what killed it for me was when I did
that Scifi show with Duncan trussell and

952
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:32,600
we went to the Pacific northwest and 
hung out with a few big foot hunters for

953
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,490
a week.
And after a while we're like,

954
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,413
dude,

955
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,820
we realized it was,
I had a joke about it.

956
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:40,930
I said,
here's what you don't find.

957
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:43,270
When you go looking for bigfoot black 
people,

958
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,283
you're more likely to find big foot.
Then you are black people looking for 

959
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:47,674
bigfoot.
What you find is hordes of unfuckable 

960
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:53,080
white dudes out camping.
And I'm like,

961
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:57,220
this is an undeniable statistic.
I'm not going to lie.

962
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:01,870
That was something I noticed this 
weekend at the Ohio big foot conference.

963
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,040
Honest to God,
I was like,

964
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,630
I was like,
I was like,

965
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:06,780
it was,
you know,

966
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,380
it was huge.
And I,

967
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,363
at one point I said,
where the brothers that they don't 

968
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:14,500
exist.
There was two guys,

969
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,020
there was two black guys.
Yeah.

970
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,660
They were,
um,

971
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,890
they were lost.
They were looking for.

972
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,970
They are looking for a car show.

973
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:29,410
It's this thing that men do get that 
though.

974
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,960
I mean,
I truly was because I shot some stuff,

975
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:33,400
Megan to document.
I said,

976
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,020
hey man,
we need some people of color,

977
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:40,090
which I was told they don't exist.
You have to cast him.

978
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,990
Did you try,
did you try women?

979
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:44,824
Did you get any women?
They all like the same kind of like 

980
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,843
count.
What am I,

981
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,323
what am I favorite makeup?
One of my favorite interviews was a gal 

982
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:56,140
who was 16 years old and she was quite 
brilliant.

983
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:57,280
I really loved her.
She was,

984
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,201
yeah,
she,

985
00:39:58,201 --> 00:40:00,550
she was my,
one of my favorite interviews,

986
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:05,380
talk to Les Stroud.
You should talk to less who I wasn't,

987
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:07,470
I'm not doing it like a definitive big 
foot.

988
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,350
I want him to do out of short about this
festival,

989
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,710
you know,
there's conference and uh,

990
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,330
you know,
that was the idea.

991
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,470
Uh,
and uh,

992
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:19,090
so yeah,
Bob Gimlin was there.

993
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,070
Your,
your,

994
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,430
your buddy.
Did He,

995
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,030
did you ask him about the story and of 
course what it,

996
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:26,320
what does he say?
He tells the story,

997
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:27,970
you know,
he tells it like it actually happened.

998
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,833
Yeah.
One of the things interesting about him 

999
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:30,964
is that he talks about the amount of 
time he actually got to see big foot 

1000
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:37,180
versus a Roger Paris and who are 
scrambling around with the camera.

1001
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,340
And what'd he say?
Oh,

1002
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:40,510
he was just talking about,
he,

1003
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:43,540
he felt that he didn't film a lot,
you know,

1004
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:47,180
and he didn't,
I mean it's only 942 of the frame.

1005
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,233
Yeah.
Yeah.

1006
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,180
Or he did because he helped the guy get 
the fucking suit on.

1007
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,470
So obviously to,
you know,

1008
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:59,580
do you know,
did we talk about the um,

1009
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,400
uh,
[inaudible] no,

1010
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,243
no,
we duck up.

1011
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,500
We've talked about that.
But did you the John Landis,

1012
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,680
John Landis though the film director.
What about them?

1013
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,480
Well,
um,

1014
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,550
I'm really sorry.
I was up since 4:00 AM,

1015
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:14,390
who was the guy in,
uh,

1016
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,120
Argo.
That was it.

1017
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,240
Yeah.
That was the movie where John Goodman is

1018
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:22,810
playing the makeup effects guy.
I don't believe I saw that movie.

1019
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,080
Right.
So,

1020
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,450
so that's a real guy.
And uh,

1021
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,390
he worked too.
I believe we worked with land is yeah,

1022
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,250
John Chambers and he'd worked with land 
is and

1023
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,190
um,
so there was a rumor that John Land is,

1024
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:41,870
is in the patty suit in the actual big 
foot suit itself.

1025
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:42,860
Oh,
I never heard.

1026
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,860
So I wanted,
I wrote to John Landis,

1027
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I asked that's not go well.

1028
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,343
I say to my agents because they are how 
he's looking for me to try to do 

1029
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:01,240
something that makes money.
So I go,

1030
00:42:01,241 --> 00:42:03,200
Hey,
I got this idea for a TV show.

1031
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,430
I want to talk to John Landis about,
I don't know what John Landis,

1032
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,900
I don't have an idea for a TV joke.
Can you get me his email?

1033
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:12,901
So they get me John Landis and email and
I write him and spoke play.

1034
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,920
I'm writing an article for magazine and 
I was wondering if you'd like to talk to

1035
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:22,921
me about this rumor about you possibly 
being in the Patterson Gimlin footage.

1036
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:24,731
Uh,
you know,

1037
00:42:24,731 --> 00:42:28,300
in a,
in a suit playing patty five minutes,

1038
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,170
I can get an answer back.
He gets,

1039
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,180
how did you get my email?
That's how it starts.

1040
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,033
Who are you writing an article for her 
and most certainly not in a big foot 

1041
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:41,194
suit at the past.
So I went back and forth and kind of 

1042
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:45,940
calmed him down a bit.
But yeah,

1043
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,330
it's such a bad suit too.
It's not a bad suit.

1044
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:51,840
You,
you see,

1045
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,840
he keeps saying it's terrible.
What is it about that footage?

1046
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,080
It's obviously a man.
It's,

1047
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,890
you know why it's obviously a man.
Why?

1048
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,893
Because it looks like a man in a suit.
There's no other animal that looks like 

1049
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:09,420
a man in a suit.
You don't look at a giraffe and go,

1050
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,370
that looks like a fucking dude in a 
giraffe suit.

1051
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,470
But you look at that big foot and you 
go,

1052
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:16,890
that looks like a fucking man.
It's walking like a man.

1053
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:21,150
It has the same sort of stride.
It just has longer arms because he's got

1054
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:21,984
football helmet,
shoulder pads or football shoulder pads 

1055
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:25,014
on and his arms.
He's got these long fucking fake ass 

1056
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:29,634
arms.
So like the whole line is fake and 

1057
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,940
breath.
Why not?

1058
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,910
How do you know?
First of all it says,

1059
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,270
Oh,
here we go again.

1060
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,760
We've done this a lot.
Yeah.

1061
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,700
There it goes.
Now what do you see breasts?

1062
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,220
What?
I see a shitty suit.

1063
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,500
No back.
There's,

1064
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,660
but what animal has Harry tits?
Do you know?

1065
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:51,750
Even gorillas,
even gorillas are unexposed.

1066
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:52,560
Yeah,
it's fucking,

1067
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,270
it's shitty.
It's pointing it over.

1068
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,880
It's got shoulder pads on.
I mean it looks like,

1069
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,110
let me watch it again,
Bob.

1070
00:43:58,111 --> 00:43:59,760
You know shoulder pads go down like 
this,

1071
00:43:59,761 --> 00:44:01,340
right?
They go down like that.

1072
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,530
You might find this.
I know nothing about the sports.

1073
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,700
I probably know as little about 
football.

1074
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,850
I don't even know the rules.
Go into the going to a,

1075
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:10,723
all right,
here we go.

1076
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,120
Why?
But here's my point.

1077
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:14,490
Why would you give it,
why would you give it breasts?

1078
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,440
Cause it's a shitty suit.
Look,

1079
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,240
look at the bottom of his feet.
It's so obviously shoes.

1080
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,030
Like it's fake ass.
The whole thing is stupid.

1081
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,123
[inaudible] here,
looking at this footage going now let's 

1082
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:28,650
stable.
All right.

1083
00:44:28,651 --> 00:44:30,780
See now you're about to eat some crow.
Boy,

1084
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,973
let me tell you something.
One time I got so high I was watching 

1085
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:35,250
this documentary.
I was watching this footage.

1086
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:36,690
I was like,
what if I'm an asshole?

1087
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:37,770
And that really is big foot.

1088
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,030
Okay.

1089
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,910
What do you mean?
Like you hurt big foot's feelings.

1090
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,083
I'm just been mocking this for so long.
Why do you hate the bears and Gameland 

1091
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:47,170
footage?
Because the first of all,

1092
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,123
look at how little it's legs are a 
little skinny ass fucking stupid legs 

1093
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,820
that is not carrying an enormous animal 
around the woods for the is is how angry

1094
00:44:57,941 --> 00:45:01,420
you are at.
Cause I hate hoaxes and atomically first

1095
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:02,254
of all right,
let's,

1096
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,050
let's talk again.
Roger Patterson,

1097
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,940
the guy wrote,
this is a con man.

1098
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,470
[inaudible] man who was the guy who was 
shot.

1099
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:12,550
It went to jail for writing a bad check 
to pay for the very camera.

1100
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:15,110
They used to film big foot.
I mean he was a known con man.

1101
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,240
Bob Hieronymus should get the video of 
Bob Heran.

1102
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:21,550
No blocking around him.
His footage,

1103
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,760
you never see his feet.
So what do you mean watch?

1104
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,280
His feet are crapped out so it doesn't 
give you the same height as patty,

1105
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,920
but it doesn't have to.

1106
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:32,933
Thing isn't big there that people have 
estimated that thing to be about six 

1107
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:37,360
foot three.
It's not that big.

1108
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,610
That's a person.
All right.

1109
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,410
You really think it's real?
Yeah.

1110
00:45:41,411 --> 00:45:42,011
I think it's real.
Oh,

1111
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:43,180
you're so crazy.
Look at this.

1112
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,340
Look.
First of all,

1113
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,180
why he doesn't have legs?
He's walking.

1114
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,280
I Dunno because it's the same height as 
him.

1115
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,890
I Dunno.
I don't know why I want an answer.

1116
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,090
Maybe make another one.
Holy Spirit will come on.

1117
00:45:58,091 --> 00:45:59,440
Look at that.
That is hilarious.

1118
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,080
That's the guy.
Could you mean it literally is him.

1119
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,830
Cause you shoulder pads on that guy.
He's always swinging his arms.

1120
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,770
Could you put Yakety Sax?
I knew this.

1121
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,930
That guy's a big goofy northern 
California,

1122
00:46:10,931 --> 00:46:13,540
Oregon type character.
You put Yakima Shit,

1123
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,240
Bill.
But you think it's real?

1124
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,640
Yeah.
So you think it's a real big foot?

1125
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,590
Yeah.
Do you think big foot's real?

1126
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:23,030
Like right now it's still alive?
Uh,

1127
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,100
yeah.
Really?

1128
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,120
Yeah.
For Real?

1129
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,380
Yeah.
What makes you think this?

1130
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,230
Well,
I,

1131
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,340
I,
uh,

1132
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:31,810
oh,
can I prove it?

1133
00:46:31,811 --> 00:46:32,350
No,
no,

1134
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,620
I'm not saying what do I believe?
What makes you say

1135
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,120
the amount of people that I've talked to
that I,

1136
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:37,954
that I'm looking at him and I,
and there's no reason for them to be 

1137
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:42,520
lying.
And the,

1138
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,413
it's basically the stories that I hear 
over and over where the sincerity I 

1139
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:51,370
don't get if it's not,
I don't understand what the,

1140
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,290
the,
uh,

1141
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,030
the,
the,

1142
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,160
you know,
what is this mass thing that I'm,

1143
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:57,994
um,
of,

1144
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,500
you know,
um,

1145
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,500
I've had guys after the movie,
like,

1146
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:05,380
you don't have like people that come up 
to me and they're almost like,

1147
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,610
yeah,
it's,

1148
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,650
I mean,
maybe they're trying to get a connection

1149
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:11,320
with me,
but I also feel like they're relieved to

1150
00:47:11,321 --> 00:47:12,400
tell someone this.
Now,

1151
00:47:12,401 --> 00:47:14,200
did they see big foot?
No.

1152
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:17,080
Maybe it's their imagination and stuff.
Maybe a lot of these stories,

1153
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:20,860
but just the amount of the stories is 
fascinating to me.

1154
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,841
It is.
Well,

1155
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:22,674
one of the things they've realized 
fairly recently is that black bears in 

1156
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:28,440
particular tend to walk on their hind 
legs a lot.

1157
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,250
Yeah.
A lot more than anybody ever thought.

1158
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,730
Not only that they and they'll knock a 
tree down towards you.

1159
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,520
Yeah.
And they can walk on there.

1160
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,960
They can walk on their hind legs for 
great distances and they,

1161
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,220
they're incredibly strong and especially
the big ones.

1162
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:43,150
Like,
um,

1163
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:48,180
a friend of mine shot one the other day 
on a hunt in Alaska that was seven foot,

1164
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,670
almost eight foot long.
Look,

1165
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:52,504
I'm going to show you a picture of him 
holding this fucking thing up and you 

1166
00:47:55,091 --> 00:48:00,091
think about this animal standing up on 
its hind legs and what,

1167
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,100
what it would look like if that thing 
was walking towards you.

1168
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,830
Now my friend John is six foot five and 
that guy,

1169
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,980
now that's clearly someone in a suit.

1170
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,401
No,
no,

1171
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:12,761
no,
no,

1172
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:13,091
no,
no.

1173
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,200
That's a bear bro.
No,

1174
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,450
no,
no.

1175
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,100
I,
I agree.

1176
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,590
I totally see how enormous that is.
No,

1177
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:24,424
and I agree that the majority of of 
people who see big foot and eight foot 

1178
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:32,350
long black bear,
but that does stand,

1179
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:35,680
that just walks around as a lot of the 
behavior that people attribute it to.

1180
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:37,660
Big Food.
I think that's what they're seeing.

1181
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:39,940
And also I think you're also dealing 
with woods.

1182
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,630
The Pacific northwest with a sightings 
are primarily occurring,

1183
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:44,763
is insanely dense.
The way I described it when we went up 

1184
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:48,070
to I,
I've been on rain here,

1185
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,660
it's like cue tips.
Yeah.

1186
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,210
Like you know,
like a box of cute tips.

1187
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,213
It's the same.
The trees look like you can't see 2030 

1188
00:48:54,221 --> 00:48:55,330
yards in,
it's gone.

1189
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:55,841
It's like,
no,

1190
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:57,430
you can't just treat anything.
Yeah.

1191
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:00,370
And so the canopy keeps light from 
coming in.

1192
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,590
So if you saw,
first of all,

1193
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:04,390
the fear that would go through your 
mind.

1194
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:06,550
If you saw a seven foot black bear 
walking on a time,

1195
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:09,160
legs through the woods and you saw it in
between trees,

1196
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,900
your mind would fill in the blanks and 
big foot has become this architectural,

1197
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,370
archetypical cultural cultural icon.
But that is something that I,

1198
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,840
not only big foot,
but almost all archetypal characters.

1199
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,733
Uh,
I,

1200
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:27,010
I,
and the devil and all these things.

1201
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:27,844
I am fascinated with this as a,
as someone who does write screenplays 

1202
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:34,450
and tell stories,
I always wonder,

1203
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:35,200
well,
what,

1204
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,630
what in the subconscious are they 
supplying?

1205
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,240
Is it just something is from,
from,

1206
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,760
from our ancestors that,
you know what I mean?

1207
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,700
Then some or,
or does it supply,

1208
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,160
this is how you told your kids not to go
in the woods.

1209
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,513
You know,
I am fascinated by what these different 

1210
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:54,730
archetypal characters are and why 
they're created,

1211
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,920
if they are created and things like 
that.

1212
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,580
Um,
I think there was an animal at one time.

1213
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,590
It's not that,
I think there was an animal at one time.

1214
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,480
Everyone knows it's a hundred percent 
fact.

1215
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,190
There was animal called gigantic pithy.
Yes.

1216
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,120
We all know this.
Right?

1217
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,550
It was a huge,
it's ingrained in us that,

1218
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:10,384
that our fear of that,
I think that thing lived alongside 

1219
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:13,774
people for a long time.
And I think when you talk about like 

1220
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,760
native American,
right?

1221
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,750
They,
when they're their folklore or when they

1222
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,070
talking about big foot and they have,
apparently they have many,

1223
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:25,870
many words for sasquatch.
Yeah.

1224
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,890
Um,
and I think that

1225
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,540
what they're probably doing is passing 
on thousands of years of data.

1226
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,523
We don't know when the last time 
gigantic epiphysis was alive because 

1227
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:41,510
they didn't know Jack [inaudible].
This was even an animal until the 1920s,

1228
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:42,344
I believe it was.
They went to an apothecary shop and 

1229
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:45,700
China and,
uh,

1230
00:50:45,701 --> 00:50:46,534
an anthropologist found a tooth that he 
couldn't attribute to any other known 

1231
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:50,294
primate.
He asked the people where they got it 

1232
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:52,670
from.
They told them where they got it from.

1233
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:53,504
They went to the actual area where they 
got these bones and they found jawbones 

1234
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,510
that would indicate the animals by 
pedal.

1235
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,523
And that's where things get really 
interesting because you're dealing with 

1236
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:07,241
some bipedal enormous animal that was 
most likely a at least eight feet tall.

1237
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,910
Right.
So a huge eight foot tall primate.

1238
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:11,983
I mean,
we know the gorillas are huge and we 

1239
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:14,324
know that,
you know,

1240
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,283
there's the Bondo eight which has this 
enormous chimpanzee that has just 

1241
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:20,450
recently been confirmed to live in the 
Congo.

1242
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,350
They have a chimpanzee and the Congo 
that's like six feet tall,

1243
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,760
400 pounds,
so enormous champ.

1244
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,660
So there are like variables,
there's V,

1245
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,503
there's different kinds of primates.
They know about the hobbit man and 

1246
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:34,730
Flores that lived as recently as,
I want to say,

1247
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:36,480
14,000 years ago,
that,

1248
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,430
that thing that lived on the 
[inaudible],

1249
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,430
that's fascinating little tiny people 
that they think also cannibalized humans

1250
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,790
and they think that human beings might 
have driven them to extinction.

1251
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:49,430
They use tools.
They were like an enemy,

1252
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,810
little tiny person thing that killed 
people perhaps.

1253
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:54,763
So I think a lot of our,
our thoughts about like leprechauns and 

1254
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:00,300
it sounds like a really good healthy,
it does.

1255
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,520
It's also people that believe that 
animals still exists or that,

1256
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:04,200
that,
that,

1257
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,750
that,
that small creature,

1258
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:09,620
the Orang deck is a one I think is in 
Vietnam.

1259
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,420
They believe that this,
uh,

1260
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:14,600
this animal's still exists and people 
still have sightings of this.

1261
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,673
And I think that that little little guy 
is probably more likely still alive and 

1262
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,510
then the gigantic.
Yeah.

1263
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,340
Well,
I,

1264
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:28,580
uh,
I think it's,

1265
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,660
it's,
uh,

1266
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,400
for me it's,
it's,

1267
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:32,303
it's,
it's,

1268
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,130
I'm not copping out.
I mean,

1269
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:34,964
I do believe,
but I also love the whole whole idea of 

1270
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:40,334
it.
And you've been in the woods and you 

1271
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:45,590
know you can't see three feet in front 
of you.

1272
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:49,070
And I love it when I'm out with folks 
and theirs,

1273
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:53,510
they'll hear an owl that sounds like a,
it sounds like an ape screaming.

1274
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,600
And then the man that's as know and they
know.

1275
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,650
Then I hear something else and they go,
I got,

1276
00:52:59,651 --> 00:53:01,010
hey man,
that sounds like a coyote.

1277
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,120
He's like,
well,

1278
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:05,540
you know a juvie squat sometime 
impersonate other animals,

1279
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,120
juveniles,
June squatch,

1280
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:08,954
Juvi squatch,
the Frank Kelly Andro of a dose of the 

1281
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,880
sasquatch was a bit from my last special
that I did.

1282
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:19,440
That was a real conversation I had with 
one of these big foot hunters.

1283
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,593
And he goes,
one time I was walking in the woods and 

1284
00:53:22,191 --> 00:53:25,290
I heard this bull frog that was near a 
blackberry Bush,

1285
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,573
and I was thinking to myself,
why is a bull frog near a blackberry 

1286
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:30,804
Bush?
And then I got home and I realized that 

1287
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:37,701
was a squatch and he was dead serious,
maybe was just a fucking frog.

1288
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:43,710
Maybe it was just a frog in his mind.
It had to be a sasquatch,

1289
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:44,544
like that kind of,
you got to that part of the story that 

1290
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:51,670
quick because when you ask,
oh,

1291
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,600
it took a long time.
[inaudible] you go,

1292
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,960
have you had any encounters?
And that goes,

1293
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,333
I'm five foot six and I'm like,
now the date was 1972 and I would like 

1294
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:05,343
it had a brand new pair of shoes and I 
had just broken one lace and what tobby 

1295
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:09,980
other lace up.
And I was thinking to myself,

1296
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,390
I'm so upset with the way they're making
these lasers these days.

1297
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,000
They've shipped off the relationship.
Charles,

1298
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,020
that's neither here nor there.
Anyway,

1299
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,350
I'm on a long backpacking trip.
You ever watch the bionic man?

1300
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,680
Oh with big?
No big foot was not in that.

1301
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:25,730
It's just like,
it's never point a to b.

1302
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,250
There's socially retarded.
They're adorable.

1303
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,330
They are adorable and a lot of ways.
Look,

1304
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,700
the guys that took me in and Dunkin,
the guys we will not with from the,

1305
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,393
what is it?
The sasquatch research found one on the 

1306
00:54:37,251 --> 00:54:40,040
fucking name.
Their organization has bfr fro.

1307
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,790
Yes,
that's it.

1308
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,820
Yeah.
They're nice guys.

1309
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,010
They're nice guys.
Yeah.

1310
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,190
But,
but I,

1311
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:49,191
and I also love it because it's a,
to me it's a microcosm of faith.

1312
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:50,933
You know,
there's the people that see it and 

1313
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:54,180
believe there's people that have never 
seen it.

1314
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,930
And then just like any other belief in a
deity,

1315
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,053
uh,
everybody's got their own version and 

1316
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,350
everybody thinks their versions right.

1317
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,690
And I love that.
That is all this in fighting.

1318
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,670
You know,
like while I was there,

1319
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,040
I would start asking people about,
well,

1320
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,050
what do you think about dog man?
And people are like,

1321
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:17,010
ah,
Ooh,

1322
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,200
Ooh,
this guy's crazy.

1323
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,063
Hey,
why don't you go back to holly weird 

1324
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,170
with that dog.
Man,

1325
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,570
that's so funny,
man.

1326
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:32,130
I can't think of a more fun weekend.
Um,

1327
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,280
they think that he can sense where 
cameras are.

1328
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,510
Well,
different folks.

1329
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:37,380
Yeah.
And there's,

1330
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,413
those are the same folks who believe 
he's travelling and portals to travel 

1331
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,090
some worm holes.
Yeah.

1332
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:49,310
SASQUATCH is interdimensional creature.
I've met many people that can sense when

1333
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,160
a camera's on.
But here's the thing,

1334
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:58,080
here's the thing that I ask you.
What evidence at all,

1335
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:58,943
if any,
compels you to think it's even possible 

1336
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:05,490
that this animal exists besides that 
footprint that I have over there.

1337
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,440
Do you see one of those?
I got one of those.

1338
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,453
Is that the chromecast?
That's from one of the fucking 

1339
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:12,000
encounters.
I think that looks like,

1340
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,100
um,
I hate to bum you out.

1341
00:56:14,101 --> 00:56:17,630
I think that it looks like from the 
Patterson Gimlin track wave.

1342
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,463
Yeah,
I do.

1343
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,220
Yeah.
I think this is given to me by Bobo

1344
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,470
from finding big foot.
Sure.

1345
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:30,280
[inaudible] we got that.

1346
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,360
How are you in Bobo get along?
Oh Great.

1347
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,253
Cause we use it.
He was upset when I was ragging on that 

1348
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:36,970
fucking Bobo.
Uh,

1349
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,270
uh,
when he found out I was doing a movie,

1350
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,720
it's the first thing he said was,
um,

1351
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,860
I'm going to fucking kick bobcat s he 
says,

1352
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,890
cause he thought I was going to make fun
of them.

1353
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,203
Imagine that.
Make Fun of big foot and he wants to 

1354
00:56:52,071 --> 00:56:54,130
kick your ass.
And you know,

1355
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,080
I'm,
my movie is very reverential.

1356
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,160
I'm not,
you know.

1357
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,320
Thanks man.
I really enjoyed that movie.

1358
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,450
And I remember calling you up right 
after events.

1359
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,620
Films,
a fun movie.

1360
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,000
Thanks.
It's really good.

1361
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:05,893
And He,
and shocking because I didn't know what 

1362
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:08,024
to expect.
Yeah.

1363
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:11,180
Remember we barely talked about it.
He just told me it's a big foot movie.

1364
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:11,950
I'm like,
all right.

1365
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:12,890
And I watched this morning,
I'm like,

1366
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:13,820
Holy Shit.

1367
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,530
Yeah.
This scene and the tense is,

1368
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,440
is,
is pretty happy with that.

1369
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,333
And you know,
when we shot that scene it was 3:00 AM 

1370
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:22,454
2:33 AM and I shot it at at uh,
allows camp between last camp and Bluff 

1371
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,613
Creek.
So I shot it where the footage was 

1372
00:57:28,371 --> 00:57:31,220
filmed.
Well and we'd seen a mountain lion.

1373
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,093
Okay.
I can check to a guy who's seen a 

1374
00:57:32,871 --> 00:57:33,591
mountain lion.
Yeah.

1375
00:57:33,591 --> 00:57:34,690
That's fucked up,
right?

1376
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,533
Yeah.
That's interesting.

1377
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,130
Have you seen with Oh yeah,
she too.

1378
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,053
Yeah.
I saw one run across the road and that 

1379
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:40,544
was weird.
And then we saw one in the woods and 

1380
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:43,820
man,
it's,

1381
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:47,540
it's crazy.
And it would have killed us,

1382
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:50,000
but it didn't want it to because we 
will,

1383
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,610
any of you,
we were just really close to just got up

1384
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,340
and just like walked away like a house.

1385
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,613
Well,
they don't worry about people because 

1386
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:59,190
they haven't been hunted in California 
since the 90s.

1387
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,760
So all these animals that you're 
experiencing,

1388
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,250
they don't view people as nearly as much
of a threat as they used to.

1389
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:08,850
But if you're like an Arizona or places 
that have a hunting season,

1390
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,710
you're not gonna see any fucking 
mountain lions.

1391
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,573
They see people,
they get the fuck out of there cause 

1392
00:58:12,841 --> 00:58:15,300
they get there,
they understand the threat,

1393
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,850
and they get used to the threat.
And then they escape and they run away.

1394
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,230
Like,
here's a perfect example.

1395
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,333
Uh,
yellowstone people haven't hunted in 

1396
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:25,950
yellowstone and over a hundred years.
So when you go to yellowstone,

1397
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,570
you could pull your car up to a herd of 
elk and they're right there hanging out,

1398
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,443
right?
You can get out of your car and you 

1399
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,010
could see them.
When you're in Colorado,

1400
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,410
you're in the mountains and you're 
hunting and you see an elk.

1401
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,210
They bark and they fucking bolt.
They see you.

1402
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,930
They go like,
they let all the other elk knows,

1403
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,700
they recognize the threat and they take 
off.

1404
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:48,301
Wow.
So,

1405
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:51,390
because we don't hunt in California,
we don't hunt mountain lions.

1406
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:53,010
Why you never see any deer.

1407
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,540
That was really terrifying.
Uh,

1408
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,210
and we filmed the scene to just film 
the,

1409
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,210
the Mount Mine.
No,

1410
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,250
we've,
but we film there cause they go,

1411
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,440
where did I go?
Well let's just go to the left.

1412
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,660
And they go and Bryce Johnson's in the 
film,

1413
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:08,970
he's like,
why don't we just get in the car?

1414
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,590
And so he was scared of the mountain and
we said,

1415
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:12,421
well,
yeah,

1416
00:59:12,421 --> 00:59:14,400
I mean it was,
it was really big.

1417
00:59:14,401 --> 00:59:16,800
That's the thing I didn't realize it's a
lion.

1418
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:17,850
Oh yeah.
You know,

1419
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:21,710
it's big.
And then we're filming the scene that,

1420
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:22,010
you know,

1421
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,470
the long scene in the tent and the first
take,

1422
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,720
it's 19 minutes long.
The one that's in the movie,

1423
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:29,900
the first take,
he started crying while we were filming.

1424
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:31,340
Why?
Because he's scared of them.

1425
00:59:31,341 --> 00:59:32,870
Outline a was just,
yeah,

1426
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:34,250
it was the whole thing.
And you know,

1427
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:35,480
and then you know,
that nature,

1428
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:38,530
that scene is,
is and a,

1429
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,650
I go,
that was really good take,

1430
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:41,990
I just don't think your character would 
cry.

1431
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,180
And he's like,
my character is not crying.

1432
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,650
I'm crying.
Why are we here?

1433
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:47,450
We could shoot this in a hotel parking 
lot.

1434
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:50,060
No one knows where the fuck I go.
That's really good.

1435
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:53,900
Use that intensity in the indices.
Just don't cry.

1436
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:54,734
We're going again.

1437
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:58,990
Aye.
Aye.

1438
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,840
Crimmons at the same

1439
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:02,860
thing with me.
He,

1440
01:00:02,861 --> 01:00:04,570
he,
he laughed really hard.

1441
01:00:04,571 --> 01:00:07,720
Like I think I live a fairly honest 
life,

1442
01:00:07,721 --> 01:00:10,420
but when I'm in production mode it's 
just I'm going to get it done.

1443
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,950
I have to truly though,
and its constraints.

1444
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,790
And when we were filming,
call me lucky the doc,

1445
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:20,140
I'm Barry,
um,

1446
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,670
uh,
we were uh,

1447
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:26,040
out on the lake and the ice started 
cracking and uh,

1448
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,720
one of the guys was from ice truckers,
so he knew the noise.

1449
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,411
He goes,
hey,

1450
01:00:29,411 --> 01:00:32,020
we got to get off the ice.
Cause it was like boom,

1451
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:32,913
boom.
Sounded like someone tuning and drum 

1452
01:00:34,151 --> 01:00:34,984
pill.
Fine.

1453
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,861
It was like,
have you ever,

1454
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:36,990
it was like boom,
no.

1455
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,620
And I go,
what do we do?

1456
01:00:38,621 --> 01:00:39,454
He goes,
everybody walk off the ice one at a 

1457
01:00:41,711 --> 01:00:42,880
time,
15 feet,

1458
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,980
20 feet between each other.
You know,

1459
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:46,023
like we made a line but we were far away
from each other and it went from fat 

1460
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:52,540
guys and then,
and it actually did like a split,

1461
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:54,700
like,
and then like snow blew up,

1462
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,200
you know,
through this Kravis cars.

1463
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,240
So we get off the ice and uh,
and there's this jetty and uh,

1464
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,600
and I go,
okay guys,

1465
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:05,950
I go,
this just,

1466
01:01:05,951 --> 01:01:08,070
just climb over the fence cause it says,
you know,

1467
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,110
do not enter closed chain.
And I go,

1468
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,013
just come up here and we just go down to
the end of the jetty and the sound guys 

1469
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,080
never worked with before.
He goes,

1470
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,240
but the sign it says do not enter.
I go,

1471
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:17,740
yeah,
the guy said if he wasn't here,

1472
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:18,610
just jumped the fence.

1473
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,293
It just jumps and Crimmons goes,
have you been lying to me this whole 

1474
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:28,250
time?
How you lie so fast?

1475
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,720
Can I get the chart?
Windy

1476
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:34,780
city.
He too.

1477
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,490
Oh,
that's awful.

1478
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,550
Oh that's how ridiculous we should pick 
this.

1479
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:45,500
I found out barry's doing a special,
uh,

1480
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,690
and at the,
where is it land?

1481
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:48,650
Uh,

Uh,

1483
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:56,200
Louis Ck is producing a special for 
bearing.

1484
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:56,870
Yeah.
You Go,

1485
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:57,703
oh,

01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,600
So beautiful.
And See Barry,

1489
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,820
what is he filming it for?
I'm not sure.

1490
01:02:07,821 --> 01:02:09,020
I,
maybe it's for Louie.

1491
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:11,570
You know how he has,
he puts stuff out.

1492
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:12,590
I don't know.
I mean it could,

1493
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,360
you know,
I don't know.

1494
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:17,960
I should ask barry where it's just going
gonna be released on Louis C K.

1495
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,260
Dot com.
Beautiful percent.

1496
01:02:19,261 --> 01:02:20,340
Sure.
But so it was beautiful.

1497
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,750
Yeah.
Barry.

1498
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:26,370
So awesome.
And I'm working on a lot of things.

1499
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,340
I really am actually right now I'm 
working on um,

1500
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,070
a couple different things I'm not going 
to discuss,

1501
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:34,590
but one of the things I can discuss is 
I'm doing a,

1502
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,960
uh,
uh,

1503
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:39,650
a short doc on the Washington generals.
The,

1504
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:44,130
the team that played the gloved writers,
I don't know about that.

1505
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:44,993
Oh,
they're the team that lost three and a 

1506
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:48,360
half thousand.
He was roughly,

1507
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:52,200
because they played the globe drought 
constantly in the fake games.

1508
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:54,780
Again,
you're still wrestling,

1509
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:55,723
right?
Well,

1510
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,220
here's what I'm learning is really fun.
They like,

1511
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:01,740
officially,
they were never told to take a dive,

1512
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,000
but they knew it.
Yeah.

1513
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:05,710
And then they fucked up once in 71,
and they'd be like,

1514
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,920
oh my God.
And that's what I'm doing.

1515
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:08,813
Oh,
children were crying in the stands at 

1516
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,220
meadowlark lemon went into the,
went into their,

1517
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,740
uh,
into their locker and he goes,

1518
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:20,280
you didn't win in the guy was great.
He goes,

1519
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:21,690
but we knew we did.

1520
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:29,080
So when the generals one when like other
people would win the NBA finals,

1521
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:31,620
I'd be like,
well,

1522
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,910
wait a minute.
Did they beat the globe?

1523
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,870
Trotters were where the globe trotters 
understand the globetrotters.

1524
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,200
The Best I've seen in the bone.
Their fingers,

1525
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,460
they do crazy stuff,
you know,

1526
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,090
is just the actual game.
No,

1527
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:43,620
no.
Uh,

1528
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,551
but yeah,
man,

1529
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:45,384
the glow chatter,
it's a little weird idea to like 

1530
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:49,500
incorporate theatrically and sort of 
like,

1531
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:51,960
almost like a sheryl wrestling type 
thing with,

1532
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,170
do they still do it?
Yeah.

1533
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,240
Yeah.
Well there's the,

1534
01:03:55,241 --> 01:03:57,270
the simpsons with Krusty,
the clown,

1535
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,403
he,
where he lost all his money betting on 

1536
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:00,421
the generals.
He goes,

1537
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:04,990
I thought they would do,
I thought they were do rep luck.

1538
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,840
He's pulling his pants down.
He's just spinning the ball,

1539
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:12,600
grab it,
grab the ball.

1540
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,320
I did the simpsons ride the other day.
Universal.

1541
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:24,240
I took my kids a universal,
this simpsons ride is fucking amazing.

1542
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:25,283
I loved it.
And there's so many jokes crammed into 

1543
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:29,820
that then too.
Yeah.

1544
01:04:29,821 --> 01:04:31,020
Yeah.
It's really funny.

1545
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:31,913
Everything,
even when you're waiting to get on the 

1546
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:33,601
ride,
the screen,

1547
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:36,150
they play you.
It's really well done.

1548
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:38,070
One of the best rides of all times.
Yeah.

1549
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,090
And a lot of laughs.
Oh,

1550
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:42,900
did you catch this?
It replaced the back to the future ride.

1551
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,011
It did.
Yeah.

1552
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:45,780
And then they do a thing where,
uh,

1553
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,033
where uh,
there's like a shady dealing between 

1554
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:52,500
crusty and doc brown and that's how the,
that's like he,

1555
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:54,720
yeah.
So even that was really well done.

1556
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:59,100
It's the same building and they just 
retooled the ride basically.

1557
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,660
Oh,
that's interesting.

1558
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:02,070
So much better.
Yeah,

1559
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,350
it's great.
It's really,

1560
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,740
it's really like one of the best rides.

1561
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,210
Lg Kid.
Well,

1562
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:08,790
this was the young,
well I went with my one,

1563
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:11,370
my seven who just turned eight and I 
have a five is,

1564
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,430
so you went with the eight year old.
Did you want to hear what all of them?

1565
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,293
Yeah.
Well the eight year old went to Harry 

1566
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,180
Potter of the five year.
Couldn't get to Harry Potter.

1567
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:18,671
Yeah,
she's two.

1568
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:22,780
She's like an inch shot.
Next time on a stuffer shoes.

1569
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,060
I'm going to get him to wear heels.
Yeah,

1570
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:25,923
she was a little bumpy,
but the eight year old reads Harry 

1571
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:29,103
Potter,
like every day she's read three of the 

1572
01:05:30,101 --> 01:05:32,050
books.
She reads chapters and chapters,

1573
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,100
everything.
She's obsessed,

1574
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,840
like she can't stop talking about Harry 
Potter.

1575
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,460
Did you get her a wand?
Oh yeah,

1576
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:38,320
the whole deal.
We went through the whole rigamarole,

1577
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:39,183
but the Harry Potter ride at universal 
is probably the greatest ride in the 

1578
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:44,920
history of rides.
It's fucking amazing.

1579
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,533
And I don't even like did you,
did you bring up a voldemort to any of 

1580
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:50,560
the employees?
Why?

1581
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,060
What happens?
Because you're not supposed to make,

1582
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,530
you mentioned them well,
their commitment is really impressive.

1583
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,410
They go,
please do not say that you had,

1584
01:05:58,530 --> 01:05:59,470
what's the date?
What is it?

1585
01:05:59,471 --> 01:06:01,780
He has no go on.

1586
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:06,160
Yeah.
He who cannot be named.

1587
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:07,550
Please do not bring up here.
You cannot,

1588
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:11,440
it's like that old graph a little bit 
like I admire your commitment.

1589
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,300
Uh,
but uh,

1590
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:16,460
I know you came here from Encino,
right?

1591
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:22,060
I just want to see if he's got a want.
Well,

1592
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,030
and also they serve this stuff called 
butter beer.

1593
01:06:25,031 --> 01:06:25,864
That I guess was a big thing.
And it's this unbelievably sugary like 

1594
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:34,300
Syrah be drink with like foam on the top
of it.

1595
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:34,811
It's,
Oh,

1596
01:06:34,811 --> 01:06:35,644
it's disgusting.
And just everybody's drinking it 

1597
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,330
everywhere.
They're all really,

1598
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:41,760
it's really well done.
Oh Man.

1599
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,220
Amazing.
We all done the way it costs more than a

1600
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,053
billion dollars.
One point $8 billion for Harry Potter 

1601
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:49,660
world.
Wow.

1602
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:50,610
Yeah.
Wow.

1603
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,443
What in the fuck.
So that's that canoe rides a star wars 

1604
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:56,640
world.
Yeah.

1605
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:59,900
That's even more Disneyland's Star Wars 
right now.

1606
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:00,843
Even more pricey.
And Aaron Spelling's Disney bought star 

1607
01:07:03,641 --> 01:07:06,670
wars and so universal is Harry Potter.

1608
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,650
I guess they were doing another world 
too,

1609
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:09,610
is I don't,
I'll look up,

1610
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,940
but they're doing two or three giant 
world spaces.

1611
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:15,700
Like they got some lame mine rods.
Jurassic parks.

1612
01:07:15,701 --> 01:07:18,760
Land was fuck the,
the um,

1613
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,140
transformers is lame as fuck.
They're too dated.

1614
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,320
I didn't do it.
Those are lame.

1615
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:23,891
Don't,
don't,

1616
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:26,560
did you go through the King Kong in 
these,

1617
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:28,000
you didn't do that.
So that's pretty good.

1618
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:29,170
The training.
Yeah.

1619
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:32,560
Cause it's the tram goes in and it's,
it's three 60.

1620
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:34,810
Uh Oh yeah.
Oh,

1621
01:07:34,811 --> 01:07:37,450
I did that a long time ago.
This is a long time ago,

1622
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,313
right?
Isn't it like 10 or 20 years old or 

1623
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:40,211
something like that?
Yeah.

1624
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:42,100
The backlog tour.
I did that back in the day.

1625
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:43,390
I did that.
But,

1626
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:45,340
uh,
I'm super impressed with the simpsons.

1627
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:49,690
And even though that was like an 
animatronic one that has banana breath.

1628
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:50,231
No,
no,

1629
01:07:50,231 --> 01:07:51,550
this is Peter Jackson.

1630
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:56,550
Three d 360 degrees screen.
Oh no,

1631
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,840
it's a universal too.
Yeah,

1632
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,000
it's nuts.
You got,

1633
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:00,903
yeah.
Yeah.

1634
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,260
That's,
that's really good.

1635
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:05,230
No,
not that I remember that one.

1636
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,150
Yeah.
And it had banana bread.

1637
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:08,360
Who did it?
Yeah,

1638
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,420
that's right.
It blows banana smell on you.

1639
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:15,421
You blow bananas because it's come full 
circle.

1640
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,630
Let me get back to this big,
big foot conflicts.

1641
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:24,670
What makes you think that any of this 
like this stupid fake footprint in front

1642
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:26,550
of us here?
What makes you,

1643
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:27,590
I'll tell you,
you know,

1644
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:31,070
it's hard to do this.
I'm not saying it's impossible.

1645
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:33,740
They can see that American Werewolf in 
London than I have out there.

1646
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,910
Yeah.
If it's,

1647
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:35,773
if that they could do that.
What would make you think they couldn't 

1648
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:38,750
do this?
Uh,

1649
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,420
thermo ridges.
No,

1650
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,450
no,
it's the,

1651
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,000
I'll tell you what's hard.
Uh,

1652
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:43,853
am I saying it's not impossible because 
there was people being pulled behind a 

1653
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:47,390
truck,
you know,

1654
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:48,530
so the,
the,

1655
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,393
with a rope,
so the spacing and the feet and then 

1656
01:08:51,051 --> 01:08:51,884
you've got enough force because you do 
have to put a lot of pressure and to 

1657
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:55,844
make this.

1658
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:58,850
But here's the weird part.
Um,

1659
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,590
and this isn't,
this is improved,

1660
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:02,600
but at what I was really a surprise 
with,

1661
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:05,090
cause we made footprints in,
in,

1662
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:07,640
in Willow Creek and did it the way you 
would think,

1663
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,533
you know,
carved would put them on your feet 

1664
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:15,560
really hard to take that,
that second stride.

1665
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:19,640
It's really strange.
It's like anti a snow shoes to the point

1666
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:22,550
where I got stuck.
Maybe it's because I'm a fat ass,

1667
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,090
but we had to get like a stick to get me
it.

1668
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:30,120
It's not saying it's not impossible,
but it was really way Dif.

1669
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:33,710
More difficult than I could imagine.
So fairly difficult.

1670
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:38,090
But still that's the best piece of 
evidence is just impressions and dirt.

1671
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,700
Just tracks.
There's never been a body,

1672
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:43,210
there's never been a trail cam 
photograph of them.

1673
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,053
Mean Hunter's set up trail camp photos 
everywhere now that people have phones 

1674
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:48,230
on with cameras on them.

1675
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:49,543
There's people hiking and hunting and 
everyone has cameras and but yet folks 

1676
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:55,370
who have footage,
what footage is any good?

1677
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:56,773
Wow.
Other than that fake footage that we 

1678
01:09:57,621 --> 01:10:00,530
watched or what footage is any good 
look,

1679
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:02,743
a lot of people don't know that.
Roger Patterson also was Abraham 

1680
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,770
Zapruder cause it's the same camera 
where he had one.

1681
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,430
He had one thing he did really well.
That gigli camera.

1682
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:15,470
Yeah.
Well when they leveled it out,

1683
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,990
um,
it's just,

1684
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,350
it's not compelling at all to me.
I really think it's fake.

1685
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,310
Yeah.
Um,

1686
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,920
but I wish it wasn't greeted,
disagree,

1687
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:29,360
but I wish it wasn't a really do like,
I want it to be real.

1688
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:34,361
It's one of my all time favorite myths.
So you would be thrilled if absolve.

1689
01:10:35,421 --> 01:10:37,100
Thrilled.
But that'd be so happy.

1690
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:39,590
I probably sleep for days.
What would you do about,

1691
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,610
um,
well that,

1692
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,170
that's the thing,
that's weird too.

1693
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:43,903
I wonder what people are seeing if 
they're not seeing bigfoot because I 

1694
01:10:47,271 --> 01:10:48,440
think they're seeing bears.
Yeah.

1695
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:49,363
Yeah.
I think they're seeing bipedal bears 

1696
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,573
and,
or bullshit or the crazy or they're 

1697
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:55,790
making things up.
I think a lot of these people are lonely

1698
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,400
and I think it's a,
it's an archetypal story.

1699
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:02,270
It's just fascinated too though about 
like when I went to the mosque men,

1700
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,310
uh,
thing,

1701
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,760
what,
what is it?

1702
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,110
If it isn't this,
you know,

1703
01:11:06,111 --> 01:11:08,630
so why,
why is it,

1704
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:13,100
is it the,
when you're getting ridiculed for coming

1705
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,430
with a story,

1706
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:18,630
why is it like over a hundred actual 
reports,

1707
01:11:18,631 --> 01:11:19,464
police reports and stuff?
When I on this phenomenon where people 

1708
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:22,710
are seeing the month,
man,

1709
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,170
you know what I'm saying?
So let's say it's fake or board,

1710
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,390
but they're in Kentucky,
Meth,

1711
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,253
West Virginia,
whatever they're out of mind out of the 

1712
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:33,020
[inaudible] 65.
Yeah,

1713
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:34,930
they were doing it back then.
People been fucking their kids.

1714
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,410
I'm not there since that's what,
twenties.

1715
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,730
Okay.
No.

1716
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:45,050
What,
what uh,

1717
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:46,543
uh,
on that story there by saying these are 

1718
01:11:49,741 --> 01:11:52,170
the wrong questions.
I'm saying by saying no mess.

1719
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:55,060
Kind of new.
So,

1720
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:56,760
so what,
uh,

1721
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,550
what's the right question?
Well,

1722
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,570
the right questions are,
well,

1723
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,523
here's,
here's what's wrong questions because 

1724
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,120
all of this is eye witness testimony,
which is the absolute worst,

1725
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,250
most unreliable piece of evidence.
You should.

1726
01:12:11,251 --> 01:12:12,360
Yet,
I was in awe.

1727
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:14,970
How many guys on death row,
et Cetera,

1728
01:12:14,971 --> 01:12:15,804
et Cetera,
because I witnessed when I was in 

1729
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,650
Alberta,
a hunting bear.

1730
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:21,930
The first time I was up there,
I thought I saw a wolf.

1731
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:23,183
It was a squirrel,
but for two seconds I thought it was a 

1732
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:26,154
fucking wolf because I saw in the woods,
I saw it moving through this incredibly 

1733
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:31,220
dense brush and I'm like,
Oh shit,

1734
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:32,340
it's a wolf.
It's a squirrel.

1735
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:35,550
What the fuck is wrong with me?
Because I was scared.

1736
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,920
My senses were heightened.
I was looking in the wall.

1737
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:38,963
We'll confer a wolf and because they are
a little bit that squirreled didn't 

1738
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:42,354
commit.
Any crime in your mind starts to feel 

1739
01:12:44,311 --> 01:12:45,144
that is Max.
That is not the wolf that stole my 

1740
01:12:48,571 --> 01:12:49,830
money.
That is a squirrel.

1741
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:54,000
You're on it.
You're buying fills in blanks and they I

1742
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:55,380
believe that.
No,

1743
01:12:55,381 --> 01:12:56,214
it absolutely does happen and people 
have put suggestions into people's head 

1744
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:00,323
and then put them in certain situations 
and then they're mine actually sees 

1745
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:04,440
things that aren't there.

1746
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:08,970
Your mind fills in blanks.
Also when you have memories of things,

1747
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:11,460
if your memory's correspond with other 
people's memories,

1748
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:12,443
you'll adjust your memories to 
correspond to an iconic or archetypal 

1749
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:19,200
type of story that people were passing 
around.

1750
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:20,243
And so if you have a story that emanates
from one particular region and one guy 

1751
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:24,990
shows up at the corner store and he 
goes,

1752
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,430
man,
you ain't going won't believe this.

1753
01:13:26,431 --> 01:13:29,850
I saw a dude with moth wings.
It's a man who was a moth.

1754
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,710
Like Holy Shit,
you hear about Bob,

1755
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,753
he's all mouth man.
And then people started getting crazy 

1756
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:36,720
and they're sitting around drinking and 
the next thing you know,

1757
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:38,010
pd saw them off,
man,

1758
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,500
I was coming home,
I was leaving the bar,

1759
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,453
I was all mad.
And all of a sudden I saw a man with 

1760
01:13:43,891 --> 01:13:46,140
moth's wings and I stopped thinking 
about my own troubles.

1761
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:46,830
And I said,
man,

1762
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:49,320
this might be a demonic area.
We've got pitch.

1763
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,140
And the next thing you know another dude
sees the moth man,

1764
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,270
then it spreads.
And then those stories are,

1765
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:58,050
they become 10 years old and 20 years 
old and it goes on and on and on.

1766
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,153
People are full of Shit.
But the very specific time it was for 

1767
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:04,734
one year,
people were seeing all these mosman or 

1768
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:09,360
one moth man,
right?

1769
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,160
And then same time

1770
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,993
there's Ufos in this area,
and then people were being visited by 

1771
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:17,884
men and black,
and then this bridge collapsed and they 

1772
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:22,414
believed that the moth man is some sort 
of banshee that shows up to warn people 

1773
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,820
that,
uh,

1774
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:30,820
something terrible is about to happen.
It seems totally logical.

1775
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,100
Come on,
just fill in the blanks.

1776
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,330
Oh,
there's the mafia man.

1777
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,220
Oh,
he's up there.

1778
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:37,623
Oh,
look at that.

1779
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:39,820
Those are the gargoyle.
That's not,

1780
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,290
that's the mouth man,
Bro.

1781
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:44,210
Now that's fake photo.
You know what's fake?

1782
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,470
You know,
look,

1783
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,780
I mean just the Jersey Devil.
Here's another one.

1784
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:51,700
Jersey Devil.
Do you ever see the journey?

1785
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:54,790
I like to do a show where,
where I go,

1786
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,750
I take out like luxury,
like that Jersey Devil remind me.

1787
01:14:58,751 --> 01:14:59,584
So,
so I want to take out other other 

1788
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,120
filmmakers.
Like if Jersey Devil,

1789
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:08,590
I get Kevin Smith and go go in a tent 
and go look for the Jersey Devil.

1790
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,380
Don't you think that's a great idea?
It might come on.

1791
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:13,750
It might be funny.
Did you remember what was that?

1792
01:15:13,751 --> 01:15:16,780
Monster show was the monster.
She got all that,

1793
01:15:16,781 --> 01:15:19,350
but I liked the idea that like this is,
yeah,

1794
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,800
but this is just,
you know,

1795
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:21,663
this,
this is just a reason to get guys who 

1796
01:15:23,141 --> 01:15:26,260
shouldn't be out in the woods.
Do you know what I mean?

1797
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,423
Right,
right.

1798
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,523
Take,
take steven soderbergh out looking for 

1799
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:31,910
the swamp ape.
You know what I mean?

1800
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,320
We're not the most robust gentleman.
Right?

1801
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:37,810
We're not the adventures.
Oh,

1802
01:15:37,811 --> 01:15:38,644
please.
But if you really do think there's 

1803
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:40,583
storytellers,
well that's one of the reasons why Les 

1804
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:43,023
Stroud becomes interesting because less 
drought is add two experiences and one 

1805
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:49,960
of them that he is pretty adamant.
Yeah.

1806
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:50,794
I had a bit of bear,
couldn't have been anything else and he 

1807
01:15:52,091 --> 01:15:52,924
really believes that it was a sasquatch 
to the point where he's dedicated weeks 

1808
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:58,270
and weeks to going out into the woods 
and,

1809
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,223
but hanging out with a known charlatan,
the guys hanging out with is a total 

1810
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:02,680
bull sharks.

1811
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,440
I'm sure you've seen this show.
Have you seen bigfoot show with a guy?

1812
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:08,000
Wears the mask in,
pretends he's big foot now.

1813
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,213
He's never seen the footage of what I,
that last drought is hanging around 

1814
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:15,070
with.
Oh No.

1815
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:20,080
Put a fucking mask on and got close up.
Video footage of him standing there even

1816
01:16:20,081 --> 01:16:23,650
blinking with this fintech.
Is it Shabaka mask?

1817
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,390
I don't know what kind of basket is.
It's so fake.

1818
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,690
It's so fake.
It hurts my feelings.

1819
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:30,700
It hurts my feelings when I watch it I 
go,

1820
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:31,534
oh my God,
they fly because I have children and 

1821
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:33,874
that it makes me think this is someone's
kid who grew up and he's now he's this 

1822
01:16:36,671 --> 01:16:38,950
fucking stupid that he made.
This video will get it.

1823
01:16:38,951 --> 01:16:40,060
That's it.
Back there.

1824
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:44,260
Look at this as if this thing is just 
hanging out.

1825
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,050
And by the way,
this guy who made this,

1826
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:47,913
according to the big foot researchers,
he's got a history with having problems 

1827
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:54,490
with reality.
And so wait till you see the fucking,

1828
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,620
when they zoom in it's like,
oh,

1829
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:56,750
is it there?
Cause it,

1830
01:16:56,751 --> 01:17:00,220
they're all thinking,
I've seen this pretending it's an actual

1831
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,800
declerk squatch hold on,
wait till he get cultural feel like this

1832
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:09,230
is is a hold 100% real.
I just try to zoom in it.

1833
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,130
Oh,
there it is.

1834
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,510
Oh my God.
He's looking at me.

1835
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:13,460
I can't believe it.
My blood turned cold.

1836
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,191
I'll start,
uh,

1837
01:17:14,191 --> 01:17:18,050
getting goosebumps all across my arm and
I was looking at him and I realized this

1838
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,450
cannot be a man in a suit.
It's too good.

1839
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,220
I got bad.
That is Kamala Furry is,

1840
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,273
it's like someone was like one of those 
hats that like really rich old ladies 

1841
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:29,120
wear when we're walking down fifth 
avenue.

1842
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,440
How do you argue with stupid?
That is stupid.

1843
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:34,610
It is.
Oh my God,

1844
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:36,110
look at that one even better.
Watch it.

1845
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:37,940
Watch it blank.
We've heard that's like,

1846
01:17:37,941 --> 01:17:38,774
you know,
it's real.

1847
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,950
It's fucking real bobcat of blank.
Look how it's quaff to luke.

1848
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:45,560
His hair's combed like fonzie.
And I hear that a lot.

1849
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:48,230
It looks like Fabian that he's got 
hairspray on.

1850
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,153
Then,
um,

1851
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:52,130
that very clean.
Come on.

1852
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:55,300
Get the fuck out.
Right.

1853
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:59,210
Look at that.
Well that obviously clearly that fake as

1854
01:17:59,211 --> 01:17:59,751
fuck.
No,

1855
01:17:59,751 --> 01:18:00,584
that's fake.
Yeah.

1856
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,110
Yeah.
I'm not going to survive.

1857
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:02,944
Or Man,
Les Stroud is a friend of mine had that 

1858
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:05,564
fucking,
they put that shit on the show and he 

1859
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:10,580
had some like so big.
It's not like a caveat like what does he

1860
01:18:10,581 --> 01:18:11,710
say?
He doesn't,

1861
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,550
it's still,
does he say that that's real.

1862
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:14,683
It all becomes very problematic when yo 
money tied into whether you can't talk 

1863
01:18:19,701 --> 01:18:22,850
too much shit cause it's on his show.
He makes money off that show.

1864
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:27,170
By the way,
that Survivorman bigfoot massive ratio.

1865
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,910
It gets bigger ratings than regular 
survivor man.

1866
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:30,763
Like we dropped some stuff off and 
fucking Africa by himself with a butter 

1867
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,540
knife like that.
That's impressive.

1868
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:38,930
That's,
he's done some real aim and that doesn't

1869
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:42,590
get nearly the ratings at this hanging 
out with his fake bigfoot guy does,

1870
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,023
you know?

1871
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,200
Well it's weird man.
Well so,

1872
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:50,570
so well they,
they buried there.

1873
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:51,980
There,
there maybe.

1874
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,610
See,
I talked to a,

1875
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:54,444
this guy todd does hotel,
who's a biologist and we did some tests 

1876
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,250
on all these different things that 
people thought were big foot shit,

1877
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,350
big foot hair.
It's all bears.

1878
01:19:03,351 --> 01:19:05,660
Bears are dogs or coyotes or something 
like that.

1879
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,950
But all of it we did actual for that 
team.

1880
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:08,861
We have,
yeah,

1881
01:19:08,861 --> 01:19:12,080
we all went to a real lab at Nyu,
did a real tests.

1882
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,330
It's all bullshit.
There's nothing,

1883
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,183
there's not one piece of evidence.
And then there was that lady who was 

1884
01:19:17,911 --> 01:19:21,440
that lady from Texas who was calling 
their name DNA.

1885
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,760
Yeah.
They all got to catch him.

1886
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,273
Catch him.
She was saying that she found DNA that 

1887
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:29,110
had,
it was some sort of nonhuman primate.

1888
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,740
It's bullshit.
It's tainted.

1889
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:31,783
But she's um,
she's kind of ostracized in the big 

1890
01:19:34,671 --> 01:19:36,740
football.
They've cast her aside.

1891
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:40,160
That's how you know you're full of shit.
The big foot communities,

1892
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:44,530
like this bitch is too crazy for us.
Kick rocks.

1893
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:46,460
Melba.
Yeah.

1894
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:48,470
It's telling you're a fucking horse shit
over here.

1895
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:50,130
Go Penalty.
Who?

1896
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:54,050
You better have your shoe bags.

1897
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,710
So,
uh,

1898
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,240
all right,
we're not going to agree on that.

1899
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:00,780
That's why I've been,
listen,

1900
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:04,760
I don't discount the possibility that 
not only did that animal exist,

1901
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:08,400
but maybe even could still exist because
the Pacific northwest,

1902
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,530
incredibly dense.
It's a massive event.

1903
01:20:11,531 --> 01:20:14,670
It's a weird environment part.
That's actually the part,

1904
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:17,880
one of the things when you get out there
and you truly,

1905
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:19,740
I mean they lose planes in there.
Oh yeah.

1906
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:22,040
And they don't find them.
You,

1907
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:25,230
you can be,
I've been in places where I'm like,

1908
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:27,360
I'm not,
I'm lost.

1909
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:28,770
And you know what I mean?
Like,

1910
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:32,730
and it's a question of like 10,
15 feet like that dense.

1911
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:34,690
It's crazy.
So that's what that is

1912
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:35,923
about.
Insane amounts of acreage that people 

1913
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:41,920
just don't live in from Oregon all the 
way down the northern California ranch.

1914
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,090
So I mean,
that's the part that,

1915
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:44,963
uh,
when I started going around and I went 

1916
01:20:46,581 --> 01:20:47,840
in that deep,
I was like,

1917
01:20:47,841 --> 01:20:48,830
wow,
this is,

1918
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:51,830
it's crazy how remote that is.

1919
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,600
It makes it compelling.
But the,

1920
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,820
the,
the shitty stories,

1921
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,730
the fake footage,
the fake footprints,

1922
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:00,564
all the fakeness.
It makes me wonder if you're just 

1923
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:03,744
dealing with a myth that is kind of cool
to talk about because it exists in this 

1924
01:21:07,121 --> 01:21:08,280
very strange environment.

1925
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:09,870
Yeah.
I,

1926
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,810
I,
uh,

1927
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:13,420
I totally agree that I love,
I do.

1928
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:15,100
I do.
And since I was a kid,

1929
01:21:15,101 --> 01:21:18,970
I'm always been fascinated by these 
different kinds of characters and,

1930
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,410
and who are they and what,
uh,

1931
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:21,840
what do they mean to us?
Yeah.

1932
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,890
And that's really key.
I mean,

1933
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:28,240
I'll be writing a screenplay that it has
nothing to do with Frankenstein.

1934
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,370
And I realized later on,
I was like,

1935
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,233
oh,
I was,

1936
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,640
this was Frankenstein.
Yeah.

1937
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,260
You know what I mean?
This is someone who,

1938
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,340
who was rebuilt after being marred and 
became,

1939
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,203
you know,
and come to the fire and became this 

1940
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:46,330
monster that is unstoppable.
And I have to get finished writing.

1941
01:21:46,331 --> 01:21:46,901
And I go,
oh,

1942
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:48,710
I just wrote Frankenstein,
goddammit.

1943
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,593
You know?
So,

1944
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,800
um,
I,

1945
01:21:50,801 --> 01:21:52,950
you know,
and I'm fascinated by,

1946
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:53,843
by that.

1947
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:54,850
Well,
it's,

1948
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:55,683
it's also the fact that native Americans
don't really have a lot of fake animals 

1949
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,140
in their folklore.
There's not a lot of,

1950
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:06,260
but this one is incredibly prevalent.
Yeah.

1951
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:07,070
And,
uh,

1952
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:07,903
I really think it has to do with jug and
Opeth Agus and if you follow where Chai 

1953
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,450
Candle pithiness was,
Jack [inaudible] was in Asia and uh,

1954
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:16,850
just like all the other animals came 
across the bering strait,

1955
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:17,703
right.
If they did come across the bering 

1956
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:19,224
shape,
they would be exactly in the area where 

1957
01:22:22,281 --> 01:22:26,180
the sightings are from Alaska all the 
way down the Pacific northwest,

1958
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:28,790
Vancouver,
northern bc,

1959
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,940
those are the areas where you have the 
BC rockies,

1960
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,740
those are areas you have the most 
sidings.

1961
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,230
So,
but those are areas where the bears are,

1962
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,410
you know,
it's the same range as these black bear.

1963
01:22:39,411 --> 01:22:44,411
So I think it's entirely possible that 
at one point in time there was something

1964
01:22:44,841 --> 01:22:48,770
like that that made it over here along 
with um,

1965
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,090
with human beings.

1966
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:52,650
And you believe that,
um,

1967
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,680
this is um,
like,

1968
01:22:55,681 --> 01:22:56,440
um,

1969
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:01,440
I just sense memory that has gone from 
generation to generation.

1970
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,493
I think he's just stories that get 
passed down and those stories become in 

1971
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:06,364
our head and then we go looking for it.
And I think it's entirely possible that 

1972
01:23:09,221 --> 01:23:13,540
written language is like how long has,
how long has spoken language been around

1973
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:14,740
for?
I want to say,

1974
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,670
I want to say it's like 40,000 years,
but I might be wrong.

1975
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,350
I think,
I think language is like,

1976
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:22,150
it was spoken language is like 40,000 
years old,

1977
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:24,530
which is not really that long.
So the,

1978
01:23:24,531 --> 01:23:25,364
which means spoken language most likely 
was around somewhere around the time 

1979
01:23:31,121 --> 01:23:31,954
that animal exists.
It's like if they didn't know that 

1980
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:33,874
gigantic pithy is a gigantic pithiness 
existed at all until the 1920s and the 

1981
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:40,084
bones that they got from this one area 
were dated at about a hundred thousand 

1982
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,063
years old.
It's entirely feasible that these 

1983
01:23:46,631 --> 01:23:49,690
animals could have survived another 30,
40,

1984
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:50,524
50,
who knows how many thousands of years 

1985
01:23:52,031 --> 01:23:53,680
until it eventually became extinct.

1986
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:54,813
So if that's the case,
I think people probably experienced 

1987
01:23:57,401 --> 01:23:59,140
them.
They probably came in contact with them.

1988
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:01,360
Um,
and um,

1989
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,343
there's also,
there was a bunch of different bears 

1990
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:06,070
that existed.
Uh,

1991
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:10,870
was it a flathead or a flat face bear?
I forget what it's called.

1992
01:24:10,871 --> 01:24:11,704
Flat nose bear flat face bear.
But it was a prehistoric bear that 

1993
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:18,190
existed in the place to scene that,
um,

1994
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,650
was,
uh,

1995
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:23,590
such a formidable Predator,
apparently according to Dan Flores,

1996
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:28,800
that he thinks it impeded the progress 
of people from Asia to North America.

1997
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:31,270
There was a huge,
like the biggest barrier,

1998
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:35,560
like as big as a Kodiak Grizzly,
so that these enormous bears,

1999
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,840
flathead bear,
Short face bear.

2000
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,070
That's it.
That's it.

2001
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:41,200
Wow.
Look at the size of this fucking thing.

2002
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:44,800
I mean,
this is an absolutely enormous bear.

2003
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:49,830
That was the Apex Predator of North 
America that went extinct.

2004
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:50,891
Uh,
find out when it,

2005
01:24:50,891 --> 01:24:52,450
when it's double the size of it,
like a big,

2006
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:54,580
they were,
I mean,

2007
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,460
it's a fucking monstrous,
monstrous,

2008
01:24:57,461 --> 01:24:58,540
predatory animal.

2009
01:24:58,840 --> 01:24:59,673
And did this animal,
was the preeminent a Predator in North 

2010
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:05,380
America?
And what year was that?

2011
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:06,820
Not that long ago.
I mean,

2012
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:08,770
while humans were alive for sure.
Wow.

2013
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:09,731
Yeah.
Let's,

2014
01:25:09,731 --> 01:25:12,400
um,
find out when it went extinct.

2015
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:15,100
It's a 11,000 years ago.
That ain't shit,

2016
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:18,790
nothing and shit.
So that would also be,

2017
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:23,050
especially if it like the black bear and
like many grizzlies walks on two legs.

2018
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:23,973
Right?
So if that thing was out there walking 

2019
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:26,110
around on two legs,
that would,

2020
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,870
you know,
native Americans,

2021
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,660
native Americans have some weird 
relationships with bears too.

2022
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:34,510
It's one of the few animals that they 
refuse to hunt.

2023
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:35,950
They don't,
they don't hunt them.

2024
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:39,910
And a lot of the first nation people up 
in Canada,

2025
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:40,863
like I have a buddy of mine who lives up
in Canada and he hunts bears and he 

2026
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:47,770
trades with first nation people.
They won't hunt bears,

2027
01:25:47,771 --> 01:25:48,604
but they want bear fat for their 
medicine and they use it to make pies 

2028
01:25:52,241 --> 01:25:53,260
and a bunch of different things.

2029
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,900
You're like Bayer Lard.
It's like very prized.

2030
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:56,734
But they,
why weren't they smell weird religious 

2031
01:25:59,171 --> 01:26:01,750
stuff like [inaudible] or do they play 
drum stuff?

2032
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:04,400
They believe guys like an ancestor 
that's coming back.

2033
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,270
All right.
I have some,

2034
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:08,900
some interesting ideas about their 
answers are delicious.

2035
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:10,940
Yeah,
well the kids good if they eat the right

2036
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:13,280
foods.
If you find a bear that's a coastal bear

2037
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:14,114
that's been eating a lot of salmon,
they're not fun to eat because they eat 

2038
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,230
a lot of rotten fish and they taste 
terrible apparently.

2039
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:19,783
But the bears that I've eaten,
I've only been the ones that live in 

2040
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:25,690
these dense woods and their diets were 
part of the country,

2041
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,533
Alberta.
That's where you go bear at northern 

2042
01:26:27,801 --> 01:26:28,880
Alberta.
Um,

2043
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:32,300
mostly what they're eating is berries 
and twit end each other.

2044
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:35,270
Unfortunately,
really 100%.

2045
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,360
That's one of the big things about bears
is that especially the males,

2046
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:41,030
which is the ones you go after and kill,
they eat cubs.

2047
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:42,561
Wow.
Yeah.

2048
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:45,440
Like all of them do.
It's like one of the main things they go

2049
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:48,140
looking for once they come out of 
hibernation.

2050
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:49,910
Wow.
All apologies to my dead.

2051
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:50,893
Yeah.
And there's been a lot worse hours and 

2052
01:26:54,231 --> 01:26:56,420
there's two theories about the cutting.
Have another bobby,

2053
01:26:56,421 --> 01:26:59,480
if I cry,
I'm so full.

2054
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:05,420
It's a awful,
it happened when we were there two years

2055
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:06,710
ago.
One of our,

2056
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:07,544
uh,
one of one of the guys who was a guide 

2057
01:27:08,511 --> 01:27:11,420
there saw,
we saw two bears fight.

2058
01:27:11,421 --> 01:27:14,540
I saw with my own eyes a bear trying to 
kill this,

2059
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:15,374
a females cubs.
And she fought him off and she kept 

2060
01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:20,600
fighting him off and he kept coming in 
and she kept fighting off.

2061
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,520
Meanwhile,
her babies were up in trees,

2062
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,473
the babies ran up and trees like we were
watching her move around and she was 

2063
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:28,454
kind of aware of us,
but we were far enough away from our 

2064
01:27:29,891 --> 01:27:32,630
work and we weren't moving where she 
didn't think we were a threat,

2065
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,120
but then all of a sudden the baby bears,
they,

2066
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:35,963
they,
they piped up and they fucking just ran 

2067
01:27:38,001 --> 01:27:38,834
up a tree and we were like,
what the fuck's going on in this big 

2068
01:27:41,451 --> 01:27:45,500
male bear came in and the two of them 
just started duking it out and they were

2069
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:46,334
like,
it was like a UFC fight 50 yards away 

2070
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,000
and should me these two bears,
I mean,

2071
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:50,810
they'd go on a war.

2072
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:53,030
It was crazy.
It was really fascinating.

2073
01:27:53,031 --> 01:27:57,980
It was too dark even for us to shoot the
big male bear because it was just,

2074
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:58,814
it was,
was enough visibility wouldn't be 

2075
01:27:59,631 --> 01:28:01,760
ethical to do,
but it was fascinating to watch.

2076
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:04,610
Like she was protecting her babies from 
predication,

2077
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:08,420
from another band and she,
and she scared it up.

2078
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,570
But here's what happened.
I'm not with this bear,

2079
01:28:11,571 --> 01:28:12,404
but in that same time we were there,
one bear came in and one of the guides 

2080
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,990
saw it happen,
got ahold of one of the cubs,

2081
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,510
killed it in front of everybody was 
eating it,

2082
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:24,290
then she chased him off and then she 
finished her own cub.

2083
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:27,103
Uh,
it's a hard scrabble world up there 

2084
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,480
living in the woods of northern Canada.
It's no joke.

2085
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:33,440
Wow.
Yeah.

2086
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:35,720
It's no joke.
It's scary shit.

2087
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:37,243
And so that's the reality of these 
animals and the population up there is 

2088
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:42,733
insane.

2089
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:45,320
There's so many of them when people,
yeah.

2090
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:47,300
When people think like they think,
Oh,

2091
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:49,280
you're killing bears,
why would you kill bears?

2092
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:52,520
There's not even that many barriers.
You got to go to Alberta.

2093
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:54,710
There's a lot of fucking bears.
There's,

2094
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:58,370
they're all over the place.
Like it's not uncommon on a day up there

2095
01:28:58,371 --> 01:29:00,080
to see 18 bears.
Wow.

2096
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:03,240
We've seen we've more than other days.
It's crazy.

2097
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:04,650
Wow.
You always see bears.

2098
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:06,750
You always see him when you go hunting 
for bears,

2099
01:29:06,751 --> 01:29:10,740
the success rate is very high and the,
the population is very high.

2100
01:29:10,741 --> 01:29:15,741
And also they encourage it.
They want you to kill two large males.

2101
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:16,853
That's like,
will they give you a tag to kill two of 

2102
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:18,480
them?
Right.

2103
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,510
Because they're killing all of these 
cubs and because,

2104
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:22,110
or,
um,

2105
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:25,710
fonz rather they're killing moose 
calves,

2106
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:26,813
elk calves and,
and deer fawns they wipe out more than 

2107
01:29:29,641 --> 01:29:33,450
50% of all the baby moose,
baby deer and baby a elk.

2108
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,800
Um,
a moose.

2109
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:38,780
Yeah.
Do you ever see them?

2110
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,100
Oh yeah,
there was a moose.

2111
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,540
Dad Is,
Oh really?

2112
01:29:41,541 --> 01:29:43,060
Yeah,
that's a juvenile was,

2113
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,710
yeah,
that was used,

2114
01:29:45,711 --> 01:29:47,510
I think it was 900 pounds.
Wow.

2115
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:48,530
Yeah.
Wow.

2116
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:52,040
It's funny,
like none of this sets me off.

2117
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:52,611
And then,
you know,

2118
01:29:52,611 --> 01:29:53,690
and I said,
cause I mean,

2119
01:29:53,691 --> 01:29:56,090
this is what I grew up with.
There was always,

2120
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:58,370
there was,
I remember once my brother,

2121
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,631
you know,
he would,

2122
01:29:59,631 --> 01:30:00,464
uh,
clean the deer in the garage and he had 

2123
01:30:04,311 --> 01:30:08,120
this idea that he was going to take the 
skin off.

2124
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:10,920
Uh,
so he likes me,

2125
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,490
like he sliced the,
you know,

2126
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:16,340
he was going to peel the skin off of the
year,

2127
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:19,220
will the truck,
his Volkswagen.

2128
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:20,143
Okay.
So he hooked it up and then it just 

2129
01:30:22,761 --> 01:30:23,594
snapped

2130
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:28,550
year and a half star

2131
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:29,681
dark.
Yeah.

2132
01:30:29,681 --> 01:30:32,470
Maybe that's why I'm a Vegan and you 
know,

2133
01:30:32,471 --> 01:30:35,050
and I'm gonna like tiny little boy,
you know,

2134
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:38,170
calm.
He's in the garage,

2135
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:39,373
you know,
dismantling Rudolph with is Volkswagen 

2136
01:30:43,901 --> 01:30:44,734
bug.

2137
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:45,923
Um,
I had this conversation with these guys 

2138
01:30:46,851 --> 01:30:47,684
from this,
this documentary cowspiracy and it was 

2139
01:30:50,241 --> 01:30:52,340
all like really heavy and it's really 
like,

2140
01:30:52,341 --> 01:30:54,950
um,
about factory farming,

2141
01:30:54,951 --> 01:30:57,540
which I think is disgusting.
And I think pretty much everybody does.

2142
01:30:57,541 --> 01:31:00,890
And The AG gag laws,
which are even more disgusting,

2143
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:04,700
which are these laws that are in place 
to keep you from taking video footage of

2144
01:31:04,701 --> 01:31:05,450
any,
uh,

2145
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:06,283
harm atrocities.
And then I went home and I turned on 

2146
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:13,400
that Steve Rinella guys show and he was 
showing how to butcher a deer.

2147
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:14,503
And one of the ways they did it was they
take like a rock and they wrapped the 

2148
01:31:19,731 --> 01:31:24,731
hide up in this rock and then tie it off
and then tie that rope on that rock to a

2149
01:31:26,001 --> 01:31:29,960
truck and then pull it.
And it just looks so fucked up.

2150
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:33,530
Is deer hanging by?
It's like honches.

2151
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:33,790
Yeah.

2152
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:36,110
And then they just strip the skin off of
it,

2153
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,360
have like a sheet and they're like,
oh,

2154
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:39,283
is it safe and safe?
And then they're cutting it up and 

2155
01:31:42,351 --> 01:31:43,184
slicing it and turning it into roasts 
and chops and steaks and hamburger meat 

2156
01:31:48,891 --> 01:31:49,790
and like,
whoa.

2157
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,073
It just,
the cold reality of what meat is and 

2158
01:31:54,591 --> 01:31:57,560
where it comes from,
which has escaped us.

2159
01:31:57,830 --> 01:32:02,680
It is like it left the consciousness of 
most people who eat meat,

2160
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,690
they don't experience it.
They don't see it.

2161
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:07,120
It's like,
it's one of the things that's insidious,

2162
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,263
um,
about a lack of information because of 

2163
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:14,230
the lack of information changes,
the actual context.

2164
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:17,830
It changes what a thing is to you.
It's one of the things I think is really

2165
01:32:17,831 --> 01:32:18,664
devious about what the Bush 
administration did when they pass laws 

2166
01:32:22,271 --> 01:32:25,450
that kept people from taking photographs
of coffins.

2167
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:26,470
Just coffee.
Yes.

2168
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:30,510
They made a law against press taking 
photos around.

2169
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:33,280
Yeah.
Which is crazy because they're not only,

2170
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:34,114
they are,
they're filtering and controlling the 

2171
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:42,190
narrative so much that you can't even 
see an American flag draped coffin.

2172
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:43,103
Yeah.
It's very dark because then I remember 

2173
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:46,300
when name mind.
Yeah.

2174
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:48,280
Yeah.
In your mind only means war.

2175
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:50,980
If you lost your friend or if you lost 
your husband,

2176
01:32:50,981 --> 01:32:53,080
or if you've lost your wife,
then it becomes war.

2177
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:55,480
But if it's just somebody you don't even
know,

2178
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,700
then it allows you to just keep going on

2179
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:58,930
number.
And it's,

2180
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:01,740
it's,
it's just a number and it's very,

2181
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,360
yeah.
I mean,

2182
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:05,280
what,
you know,

2183
01:33:05,281 --> 01:33:08,030
one of the things that got us out of 
Vietnam was the,

2184
01:33:08,031 --> 01:33:11,590
the footage that was on the news every 
night when you're having dinner and you,

2185
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,450
you know,
that,

2186
01:33:12,451 --> 01:33:13,290
that,
that,

2187
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,450
that was what ended it.
I mean,

2188
01:33:15,451 --> 01:33:16,220
what do I know?
But that,

2189
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:18,240
that felt like when I handed it to me.
Yeah.

2190
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:18,990
Well look,
it's,

2191
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:23,060
here we are 15 years later,
we're still in Afghanistan.

2192
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,160
Yeah.
Why?

2193
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:29,730
And there's never any footage Navarro.
And when I was a kid,

2194
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,013
when I was at a kid,
that was what was on during the news 

2195
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:38,540
while we're having dinner.
And that was what I saw my parents turn,

2196
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:42,550
you know,
my parents went from cursing hippies and

2197
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,260
per war protesters to go into the other 
side.

2198
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:47,370
Wow.
You know,

2199
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,350
so it must have been interesting.
Yeah,

2200
01:33:49,351 --> 01:33:50,310
I mean,
I watched it,

2201
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:52,830
you know,
and so yeah,

2202
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:54,600
the fact that the,
uh,

2203
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:55,980
I remember when,
when,

2204
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:56,940
when,
when,

2205
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,833
when that happened when we was crazy.
But I think the new administration is 

2206
01:34:04,431 --> 01:34:07,430
going to fix everything for sure.
Especially if trump wins.

2207
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,090
Yeah.
Very excited about that.

2208
01:34:09,091 --> 01:34:10,610
If Hillary Clinton wins,
she's going to,

2209
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,980
it's going to be all different folks.
It's not going to be business as usual.

2210
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:14,814
It's not going to be just politics,
not going to be about money controlling 

2211
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:18,030
politics.

2212
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:18,863
It's not,
I don't care where she gets her money 

2213
01:34:20,341 --> 01:34:20,761
from,
dude.

2214
01:34:20,761 --> 01:34:22,700
She's got ethics,
she's got oils.

2215
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:24,990
Those bankers,
they could pay her hundreds of thousands

2216
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:26,310
of dollars.
She's going to tell them off.

2217
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:28,230
Yeah,
it is.

2218
01:34:28,231 --> 01:34:32,250
But it isn't an insane camp.
And this is a,

2219
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:34,640
I've never seen anything like this.
I'm 53 years old,

2220
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:35,483
most insane.
Right.

2221
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,010
Barry must be loving it.
You know,

2222
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:37,853
it's funny.
It's got father three because Barry was 

2223
01:34:39,961 --> 01:34:41,040
out,
you know,

2224
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,520
and they dragged him back.
You know,

2225
01:34:44,521 --> 01:34:47,100
it's so crazy that he had to get back 
in.

2226
01:34:47,101 --> 01:34:48,720
Yeah.
He was like up in the woods.

2227
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:49,800
Yeah,
I know.

2228
01:34:49,801 --> 01:34:51,360
Isn't it great.
It's kind of funny.

2229
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:56,750
So we all get a gift from that.
Highlights how the system

2230
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:02,870
is that this is all it needs is a two 
party system and the in the,

2231
01:35:02,871 --> 01:35:04,460
yeah,
and the fact that it's not one man,

2232
01:35:04,461 --> 01:35:05,590
one vote.
And you know,

2233
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:06,573
there's a whole lot of that.
But this is also like what does our 

2234
01:35:08,541 --> 01:35:09,374
society become?
Our society's become this crazy thing 

2235
01:35:11,961 --> 01:35:14,360
where we pay attention to whatever 
spectacles on the news.

2236
01:35:14,361 --> 01:35:15,770
Yeah.
Well that's spectacles.

2237
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:19,130
Now a guy who's running for president 
when plastic hair.

2238
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,040
Yeah.
That guy.

2239
01:35:20,041 --> 01:35:22,190
That's a reality star though.
You're fired.

2240
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:24,740
You know those Mexicans are going to 
build us a wall.

2241
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:30,070
The Wall just got 10 foot higher.
The morons at fucking up in arms like we

2242
01:35:31,181 --> 01:35:35,120
got in quicker fucker takeover.
And it's exciting.

2243
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:38,080
It's a white people are very excited to,
it's a,

2244
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:39,140
yeah,
like white men.

2245
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:41,690
Let's make America white again.
White men.

2246
01:35:41,691 --> 01:35:46,430
And I mean ladies and ladies that like 
trump all buttoned down,

2247
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,320
angry faces,
thin lips like this.

2248
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:53,950
And it tells so interesting to the 
Republicans trying to knock out him,

2249
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:56,900
which is crazy to what can they do?
I mean,

2250
01:35:56,901 --> 01:35:58,220
what do they,
what do they have left?

2251
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:59,420
I don't know.
It's just running.

2252
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:00,770
Yeah.
Mic didn't work,

2253
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,551
Dev.
Nothing.

2254
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:03,830
Nobody's ever said quick.
Give me a mormon.

2255
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,270
Could you hear about the guy who,
who,

2256
01:36:05,271 --> 01:36:08,630
um,
who was writing a blogger who is writing

2257
01:36:08,631 --> 01:36:09,464
a piece about Ted Cruz's connection?
His father's connection to the death of 

2258
01:36:13,971 --> 01:36:14,804
Lee Harvey Oswald that apparently Ted 
Cruz's father was involved in some way 

2259
01:36:19,341 --> 01:36:21,800
with the death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
Not only that,

2260
01:36:21,801 --> 01:36:26,300
he may have played a part of in the 
assassination attempt with,

2261
01:36:26,301 --> 01:36:27,560
uh,
President Kennedy.

2262
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:30,470
He might have had a part in the 
assassination of President Kennedy,

2263
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:32,120
Ted Cruz,
his fucking dad.

2264
01:36:32,121 --> 01:36:36,620
So take parents is dance connection Jack
Ruby.

2265
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:37,963
Yes.
And just some sort of a connection with 

2266
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:41,320
the,
uh,

2267
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:46,440
the people that were rebelling against 
the Battista regime and the like,

2268
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:50,060
a lot of his story apparently is 
bullshit.

2269
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:51,920
And like,
people who have looked into it,

2270
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:52,843
and it's one of the things that they 
were looking into while he was running 

2271
01:36:54,051 --> 01:36:56,060
for president.
They're like his dad.

2272
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:57,770
It doesn't,
here's the story of his dad.

2273
01:36:57,771 --> 01:37:00,710
His Dad came over on a raft with $100 
sewn into his underwear.

2274
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:01,653
I get one of those stories and he made 
it with good old fashioned American 

2275
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:05,060
ingenuity.
Hmm.

2276
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,060
Apparently not.
Apparently he was like a rebel,

2277
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:09,163
you know,
he may have played a part in the death 

2278
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:13,580
of Lee Harvey Oswald.
Wow.

2279
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:16,190
Yeah.
Well there was a guy who was writing the

2280
01:37:16,191 --> 01:37:19,520
story about it and he wound up dead.
Wow.

2281
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:21,170
Yeah.
And you know,

2282
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:22,640
the guy even wrote,
Hey,

2283
01:37:22,641 --> 01:37:23,300
if,
uh,

2284
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:25,370
if I'm not around anymore,
you know,

2285
01:37:25,371 --> 01:37:27,290
this is what happened and this is the 
story.

2286
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:30,140
But people do that kind of shit before 
they killed themselves.

2287
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:31,770
That's,
that's your problem.

2288
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:32,623
Because they think there's a real story.
And one of the things that they're all 

2289
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:36,434
depressed,
and I think one of the things that I'm 

2290
01:37:37,011 --> 01:37:38,450
gonna do,
I'm gonna make this story happened.

2291
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:40,790
I'll blow my brains out and they're 
going to think that,

2292
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:41,763
you know,
they're going to look into this because 

2293
01:37:42,261 --> 01:37:44,300
they're going to think that I was 
whacked by the demand.

2294
01:37:44,301 --> 01:37:45,134
Like as if anybody is running around 
killing people over Lee Harvey Oswald's 

2295
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:52,400
death today.
Was that Jamie?

2296
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,860
These are the photos that they found of 
Ted Cruz's dad.

2297
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,840
Yeah.
That's the guy in the white shirt here.

2298
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,450
That's Ted Cruz's dad.
This was an unidentified man,

2299
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:01,830
uh,
from the Warren Commission.

2300
01:38:01,831 --> 01:38:04,260
So they think that that's him.
Oh,

2301
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:07,950
it looks like I'm Cuban Fella and 
there's a couple of pictures of it.

2302
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,390
But uh,
yeah,

2303
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:10,860
that's,
that's the link.

2304
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,430
Hmm.
Most likely I'm going with that.

2305
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:15,323
I'm going to run with it.

2306
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:17,250
So it looks like now

2307
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:19,280
that's him today.
Well,

2308
01:38:19,281 --> 01:38:22,970
apparently you,
his story doesn't add up when they,

2309
01:38:22,971 --> 01:38:26,010
um,
they check out the,

2310
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:29,060
the,
his history when he says he got here.

2311
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,950
Well,
when he actually was here,

2312
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:33,200
there's a lot of a funky business.
And by the way,

2313
01:38:33,201 --> 01:38:37,840
I have a fucking very,
very shallow knowledge of this story.

2314
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,340
I leafed over today.
Cruiser spawns.

2315
01:38:40,341 --> 01:38:42,920
Yes.
My dad killed JFK secret la Elvis.

2316
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:44,960
And Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his 
backyard.

2317
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,003
Aw.
Ty got sunk by that video that showed 

2318
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:52,490
the outtakes of him making one of those 
videos.

2319
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,400
Oh,
did you see that?

2320
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:54,731
I,
no,

2321
01:38:54,731 --> 01:38:58,070
no family and his mom fantastic.
Like it was a,

2322
01:38:58,071 --> 01:38:59,260
one of them was like,
you know,

2323
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:02,120
my mom prays for me oftentimes hours a 
day,

2324
01:39:02,121 --> 01:39:02,954
and she went like,

2325
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:07,030
like that.
His mom like,

2326
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:11,150
well I don't fucking pray for you.
Hours a day will come.

2327
01:39:11,151 --> 01:39:13,820
What am I crazy?
Jesus Christ.

2328
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:17,630
They made them do take after take.
There it is.

2329
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:22,410
It was like so it's so vague.
We can't hear without the headset on.

2330
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,750
There's his dad.
He killed JFK.

2331
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:26,240
Heard.
Want to hear it here?

2332
01:39:26,241 --> 01:39:27,860
I'll put the headset off.
Earlier this year,

2333
01:39:27,861 --> 01:39:28,694
the Cruz campaign posted hours of this 
footage on youtube by law campaigns 

2334
01:39:32,001 --> 01:39:32,834
can't coordinate with super pacs.
So many quietly post rock videos like 

2335
01:39:36,111 --> 01:39:39,530
this on public websites as a way to 
share material legally,

2336
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:40,483
but it lets us take a rare peek behind 
the scenes at this strange world of 

2337
01:39:43,761 --> 01:39:46,220
political ad making to me a couple lines
from Munich.

2338
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:50,300
Ah,
that's true.

2339
01:39:50,301 --> 01:39:52,760
Personal tip.
I don't want to tell that I do like it.

2340
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:54,530
I'll like it in a box.
I'll like it in a goat.

2341
01:39:54,531 --> 01:39:58,100
I'll like it.
You're the best person to tell him.

2342
01:39:58,890 --> 01:39:59,723
Well,
there's some very personal details that 

2343
01:40:04,001 --> 01:40:05,710
I don't want to go into.
I don't like it.

2344
01:40:05,711 --> 01:40:06,760
I don't like,
I don't like it.

2345
01:40:06,761 --> 01:40:07,600
I'm Sam.
I am.

2346
01:40:07,601 --> 01:40:08,470
I am.
I'm Sam.

2347
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,880
When Ted was three,
look at me.

2348
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:15,340
I need the buck of you want to give me 
specific lines,

2349
01:40:15,341 --> 01:40:16,174
but not a day goes by that my mom is not
lifting me up in prayer for hours at a 

2350
01:40:22,561 --> 01:40:24,400
time.
Ah,

2351
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:32,830
country today.
Am I supposed to say like the same type?

2352
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:33,833
My family background,
my grandfather was a missionary in 

2353
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:39,960
Africa for about 40 years.
I don't know what else was saying.

2354
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:43,980
I don't know.
Talking she keeps looking at a kid for a

2355
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:45,900
kid is fucking crazy,
dad.

2356
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,440
The brother thinks too much.
I can't get as Gig down.

2357
01:40:48,441 --> 01:40:49,274
He's gonna live there.

2358
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,470
It seems like everything is staged.
Even hugs,

2359
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:52,990
hubs.
We're out of your joy.

2360
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,370
I love you.
Oh

2361
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:55,570
No.
Who's that guy?

2362
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:58,360
I love you too.
I love your mom.

2363
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:01,570
Oh Gee,
do I love you?

2364
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:02,830
Oh,
fake happy.

2365
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,210
I love you.
I killed JFK.

2366
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:05,953
He got right in his ear.
This is the same as what we're talking 

2367
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:10,930
about.
Lime.

2368
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,030
Yeah,
this is big.

2369
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:14,320
I love you will be big fun.
Look at this.

2370
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:16,930
They're sitting around the dinner table.
Just didn't even know a camera's there.

2371
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,030
Camera just caught us.
It's weird.

2372
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:21,550
Wow.
Let's hold hands in prayer.

2373
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:24,940
Dear magic man in the sky,
who doesn't let people,

2374
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:29,860
let's make sure that our food is all 
been blessed to suggest a casual,

2375
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,120
uh,
you know,

2376
01:41:31,121 --> 01:41:34,090
we say grace first.
We laid the Dolly track out.

2377
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:35,043
First of all,
why are you pretending this is your 

2378
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:37,870
fucking kitchen table bitch?
You know,

2379
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:39,580
you got some Nice House.
You got cash,

2380
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:42,540
you got to live in a simple humble life.
Fuck.

2381
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:47,950
We were looking at before you got here,
something that I forgot about.

2382
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:50,790
Can we play that?
What?

2383
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:52,603
Um,
I forgot about this and recently I was 

2384
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:59,500
doing a show and then they stand up show
and the guy in the booth played at Avery

2385
01:41:59,501 --> 01:42:02,800
and um,
in my mind it was lot,

2386
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:05,650
lot.
It was way more chill.

2387
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:09,640
This is Arsenio Hall got canceled and 
uh,

2388
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:12,190
this is footage of me going on the show.

2389
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:15,470
Great.
What I want to know,

2390
01:42:15,470 --> 01:42:17,110
do I have to keep giving your app?

2391
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:19,570
Okay.

2392
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:21,190
This is after he's canceled.
Yeah.

2393
01:42:26,210 --> 01:42:28,130
Why am I getting easier for the next 
guy?

2394
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:31,670
Are you really quitting?
Yeah.

2395
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,833
No,

2396
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:48,970
he spray painted on his sack.
What is it?

2397
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:52,620
What are you saying?
Per Paramount.

2398
01:42:52,621 --> 01:42:54,410
Paramount sucks.
Yeah.

2399
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:57,170
Yeah.
Uh,

2400
01:42:58,710 --> 01:43:00,960
I don't even remember this.
Uh,

2401
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:05,460
and now nobody stopped you.
So really did not know I was going to do

2402
01:43:05,461 --> 01:43:06,181
this.
Oh,

2403
01:43:06,181 --> 01:43:07,590
did they know you had a can in your 
pocket?

2404
01:43:07,591 --> 01:43:08,251
No.
No,

2405
01:43:08,251 --> 01:43:09,210
no.
After this,

2406
01:43:09,211 --> 01:43:11,600
I would start getting patted down when I
did show,

2407
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,050
and this is before,
but this,

2408
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:13,410
this,
this,

2409
01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:14,770
this boy that tonight,
tonight,

2410
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:15,604
show on fire.
See through h coat couch cushions to 

2411
01:43:19,121 --> 01:43:19,891
the,
what is this though?

2412
01:43:19,891 --> 01:43:24,891
This is,
oh my God,

2413
01:43:25,371 --> 01:43:28,690
you took smashed.
It's $3,000 minded.

2414
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:30,260
Or they make you,
they charge you for that?

2415
01:43:30,261 --> 01:43:31,130
Yeah.
They were nice.

2416
01:43:31,131 --> 01:43:33,560
Leno charged me for the chair.
He did?

2417
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:34,453
Yeah.
How much did he charge you for the 

2418
01:43:34,821 --> 01:43:36,530
chance?
It's like 500 bucks isn't like that.

2419
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:38,360
Oh my God,
dude,

2420
01:43:38,361 --> 01:43:40,820
you're going crazy.
This is so punk rock,

2421
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:45,040
Arsenio stepping in and try to stop you.
But he's laughing while he's doing that.

2422
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:47,270
But here it's funny.
This is hilarious.

2423
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:55,590
I liked how you kept your hat on the 
damn board.

2424
01:43:55,650 --> 01:43:57,570
Yeah.
But here's the funny as,

2425
01:43:58,970 --> 01:43:59,990
Oh yeah,
it get stopped here.

2426
01:43:59,991 --> 01:44:02,560
But they just,
when they broadcast it,

2427
01:44:02,561 --> 01:44:04,190
they put this logo at.
Yeah,

2428
01:44:04,191 --> 01:44:06,860
that's it.
But so,

2429
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:08,270
uh,
when they broadcast that,

2430
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:09,104
they put that logo up because the 
director at the time just had this 

2431
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:15,170
loving shot push into paramount sucks.
Oh,

2432
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:16,360
that's good.
They had a problem with,

2433
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:18,830
but when he wrestled me down,
he actually,

2434
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:21,440
he whispers into my heroes.
Is there going to commercially I guess.

2435
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:26,860
Thanks man.
So then,

2436
01:44:28,221 --> 01:44:29,660
yeah,
then Leno booked me,

2437
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,680
uh,
like four days after.

2438
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,770
That's hilarious.
Cause of that is set on fire.

2439
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,780
That's what they want.
I was just,

2440
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:39,030
I was more angry I think at j,
but,

2441
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,620
but yeah,
he's like,

2442
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,410
no,
you know what happened over in Athenian?

2443
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,121
And I go,
well,

2444
01:44:43,121 --> 01:44:47,130
you angry Jay for I eat my ego and I,
you know,

2445
01:44:47,131 --> 01:44:48,870
he and fear,
you know,

2446
01:44:48,871 --> 01:44:49,704
he suddenly was having me on the show 
that was going on the show and people 

2447
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:54,203
seemed like they liked me in the idea of
being accepted on such a mass level was 

2448
01:44:57,511 --> 01:44:58,344
terrifying.
And I think I resented him because even 

2449
01:45:02,191 --> 01:45:03,024
though he's older than me,
I've been doing comedy almost the same 

2450
01:45:04,771 --> 01:45:05,604
amount of time.
And he was always kind of always like 

2451
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:09,030
doling out advice and it's like,
well,

2452
01:45:09,031 --> 01:45:10,510
I don't want to have your career,
you know,

2453
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,090
I don't do it that I think that,
you know,

2454
01:45:12,091 --> 01:45:12,924
and it's like,
yeah,

2455
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,840
I'm,
I'm a man and I make my decisions.

2456
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:17,880
I just do a different kind of comedies.
You,

2457
01:45:17,881 --> 01:45:20,130
I'm not criticizing the kind of comedy,
you know,

2458
01:45:20,131 --> 01:45:21,840
you guys do.
You know,

2459
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:23,970
there's all those sweater acts back 
then,

2460
01:45:23,971 --> 01:45:25,420
you know,
and uh,

2461
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,350
so,
and,

2462
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,090
and,
and I,

2463
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,233
I don't regret it,
but I do think I was kind of an asshole 

2464
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:33,700
move to j.
It was an aggressive movement.

2465
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,910
And I,
and I apologize to him later on,

2466
01:45:35,911 --> 01:45:36,750
years later,
I was like,

2467
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,950
I was being nasty.

2468
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,660
We're j belongs to what he's doing now.
I'm sorry.

2469
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:41,261
No,
no,

2470
01:45:41,261 --> 01:45:42,094
no.
Go ahead.

2471
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:45,760
Jay belongs is what he's doing now.
Like doing that car show.

2472
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:48,430
He's fucking great at it.
He's great on it.

2473
01:45:48,431 --> 01:45:50,890
It's fun.
Different guy.

2474
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:52,900
But he's a funny guy.
I mean,

2475
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:53,910
yeah,
that Letterman,

2476
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,390
you mean he would crush?
Yeah.

2477
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:59,370
And um,
I haven't seen the car show.

2478
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:00,583
Well a lot of comics felt betrayed 
because he was this guy who was kind of 

2479
01:46:04,761 --> 01:46:05,594
like the hips smart voice of like 
marketing a lot of the stupid shit that 

2480
01:46:09,951 --> 01:46:10,784
we saw in the world.
And then all of a sudden he gets his 

2481
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:15,080
tonight show Gig and he becomes Mr 
Living Room.

2482
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,010
Yeah.
And he was,

2483
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,600
he went from,
yeah,

2484
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:21,460
I mean it looks like I'm pinging fire.
They actually,

2485
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:24,940
um,
so he's got this show now.

2486
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,800
I think it's funny,
like in my memory I was like,

2487
01:46:26,801 --> 01:46:28,750
well that's just the little fire.
But that's a pretty good,

2488
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,593
see this is cause I have lighter fluid.
That's what made it arson cause it was 

2489
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,010
premeditated.
I learned a lot of being in the moment.

2490
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,073
Well,
I mean if I just set it on fire with a 

2491
01:46:41,801 --> 01:46:44,130
lighter,
then yeah,

2492
01:46:44,131 --> 01:46:46,050
this was,
that's why it was arson.

2493
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,890
But anyway,
he's showed that he's doing now.

2494
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,930
It's like something that he actually 
cares about and we talked about it.

2495
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,280
I had him on the podcast.
He was like,

2496
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:54,330
yeah,
I mean I would have these,

2497
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:55,333
you know,
he couldn't pick who's on the tonight 

2498
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:56,923
show.
So they would put people on like from 

2499
01:46:57,991 --> 01:47:00,480
reality shows and he'd be like,
he'd have to say,

2500
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:02,510
you and Harry,
are you going to get married?

2501
01:47:02,990 --> 01:47:03,823
Yeah.

2502
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:05,650
Yeah.
That's the nature of that.

2503
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,870
It's uh,
you know,

2504
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,730
I think letterman made a decision after,
you know,

2505
01:47:09,731 --> 01:47:11,890
some days I think,
I'm paraphrasing,

2506
01:47:11,891 --> 01:47:13,210
but someone said,
well,

2507
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:15,190
who was on the show tonight?
And he's like,

2508
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:16,960
I don't know.
And then he was like,

2509
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:18,100
I got it.
Yeah.

2510
01:47:18,101 --> 01:47:20,710
That was when he decided to retire.
Like he couldn't remember.

2511
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:23,490
I get that when I used to direct the 
Kimmel show.

2512
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:26,500
Someone say who was on last night and I 
couldn't remember.

2513
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,480
Yeah.
Because it's a grind.

2514
01:47:28,481 --> 01:47:29,360
It's weird.
Yeah.

2515
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:30,730
It's a weird gig.
When you're doing,

2516
01:47:30,731 --> 01:47:31,564
is fascinated by the ego of the guy.
Remember the guy who tried to blackmail 

2517
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:36,200
letterman?
Yeah.

2518
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:38,830
Well he was fucking the guy's girlfriend
or whatever it was.

2519
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:40,013
Letterman had had some sort of 
relationship and now this guys has a 

2520
01:47:43,091 --> 01:47:45,280
relationship.
My,

2521
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:46,773
you know,
my take on it was this guy couldn't get 

2522
01:47:49,151 --> 01:47:51,370
past that.

2523
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:55,140
She used to bang and probably,
and some of the,

2524
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:57,280
and he was going through a bad divorce,
so he's like,

2525
01:47:57,281 --> 01:47:58,114
I got this thing.
I'm going to blackmail letter men and 

2526
01:48:00,221 --> 01:48:02,520
let his current girlfriend,
I don't,

2527
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:05,620
I think the woman who became his wife 
about this,

2528
01:48:05,621 --> 01:48:06,454
he's going to blow up the whole thing.
And I love that letterman what the guy 

2529
01:48:10,031 --> 01:48:12,190
never ever,
ever thought of.

2530
01:48:12,191 --> 01:48:13,870
What if the guy just does the right 
thing?

2531
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:15,340
Yeah.
Let him and just said,

2532
01:48:15,341 --> 01:48:16,480
hey,
you know,

2533
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:18,220
this happened.
Went on TV.

2534
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:19,240
Yeah.
It was beautiful.

2535
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:22,930
And it didn't become a story like the 
way it normally would,

2536
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:26,980
and he didn't do that bullshit fake.
I did something wrong.

2537
01:48:26,981 --> 01:48:28,630
He said,
this is between my wife and I,

2538
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,060
but someone's blackmail.
I mean it just,

2539
01:48:31,061 --> 01:48:32,920
you know,
cause cause,

2540
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:36,700
cause I always,
that pho apology is really strange.

2541
01:48:36,701 --> 01:48:38,620
Like for,
for nothing.

2542
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:39,301
You know,
like,

2543
01:48:39,301 --> 01:48:41,380
um,
when hugh grant apologize,

2544
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:43,060
he said,
well I did a bad thing.

2545
01:48:43,061 --> 01:48:48,061
It's like well w did you and would,
if you hadn't been arrested,

2546
01:48:50,561 --> 01:48:53,500
what do you said,
hey I did a bad thing last night.

2547
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:55,533
I didn't get arrested anything,
but you guys should know I picked up a 

2548
01:48:56,891 --> 01:48:58,620
hooker at.
Right.

2549
01:48:58,630 --> 01:48:59,411
You know what I mean?
You wouldn't,

2550
01:48:59,411 --> 01:49:01,030
it's so it's,
what do you apologize?

2551
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:04,330
So,
but letterman didn't do a pho apology.

2552
01:49:04,331 --> 01:49:05,164
He just did the right thing and he,
and the guy's life came down like a 

2553
01:49:07,981 --> 01:49:10,720
house of cards and I,
and I think it was in jail.

2554
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:12,160
Yeah.
And I think when you're like,

2555
01:49:12,190 --> 01:49:13,023
I think as a young man,
you can't get past your partner's 

2556
01:49:15,281 --> 01:49:17,080
history,
you know,

2557
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:19,210
and this guy,
I just think,

2558
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:20,740
I don't know,
there's something really poetic.

2559
01:49:20,741 --> 01:49:21,331
I don't know.
I'm,

2560
01:49:21,331 --> 01:49:25,720
I'm fascinated by the story cause I,
the twist is all David Letterman did was

2561
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:26,643
the right thing.
And that was shocking to this guy and 

2562
01:49:28,751 --> 01:49:31,990
almost to our society.
We couldn't do anything with it.

2563
01:49:31,991 --> 01:49:32,824
We couldn't exploit it.
Couldn't sell people magazine when 

2564
01:49:35,261 --> 01:49:36,760
somebody just square.

2565
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:41,020
He also did it the way he confessed on 
television.

2566
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:44,560
He did it like a David letterman 
conversation.

2567
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:45,580
Well yeah.
Um,

2568
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,040
I was having sex with

2569
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,290
someone to work with me.
Yeah.

2570
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:51,580
And everybody's like,
what the fuck is he doing?

2571
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:52,693
I love that I spent so much time on all 
this trying to manage stuff and staying 

2572
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:03,100
instead of actually owning something 
instead of saying this is what I did,

2573
01:50:03,101 --> 01:50:05,250
this is what I did wrong.
Um,

2574
01:50:05,950 --> 01:50:07,780
it's really knowing your business.
Yeah.

2575
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:09,243
Well it's like when we catch someone 
lying about something and then they're 

2576
01:50:12,401 --> 01:50:13,870
there,
they're deceptive.

2577
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,600
That's when people get like really into 
something.

2578
01:50:16,601 --> 01:50:18,970
But when someone comes out and just owns
it,

2579
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:21,640
like Charlie Sheen,
like Charlie Sheen,

2580
01:50:21,641 --> 01:50:23,280
like when he went on all these shows and
tell,

2581
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:24,280
yeah,
I smoke rocks.

2582
01:50:24,281 --> 01:50:25,480
That's what you do.
You know,

2583
01:50:25,481 --> 01:50:27,160
I,
I smoke all this coke,

2584
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:28,070
you know,
cause uh,

2585
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:29,980
that's how I roll baby.
Everybody's like,

2586
01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:31,780
well,
I fucking love this guy.

2587
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:32,883
But meanwhile,
if someone had footage of him smoking 

2588
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:37,000
crack out there,
you know,

2589
01:50:37,001 --> 01:50:38,350
Bang and hookers,
people be like,

2590
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:40,510
oh my God,
his career is over.

2591
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:43,030
And he would say,
I got to put a spin on this.

2592
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:47,380
There would be some,
some sort of recovery.

2593
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:49,630
What's really interesting is the Charlie
Sheen thing.

2594
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:50,464
We're finding out that the whole 
tailspin that he went through and like 

2595
01:50:53,591 --> 01:50:56,800
2012 was because he found out he had 
HIV.

2596
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,310
Like that's really part of what this all
was about.

2597
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:02,530
And that's what the most recent,
uh,

2598
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:03,880
black male,
uh,

2599
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:07,120
attempts against him was.
Apparently he's paid millions of dollars

2600
01:51:07,121 --> 01:51:10,360
to quiet this down big.
And he had all these sexual partners and

2601
01:51:10,361 --> 01:51:11,194
didn't tell them,
I guess or so there's all also of other 

2602
01:51:12,731 --> 01:51:14,620
lawsuits,
most of the craziness involved.

2603
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:18,280
But that's what set him off.
And what made him say,

2604
01:51:18,281 --> 01:51:19,114
fuck it,
I'm just going to go out and tell 

2605
01:51:20,021 --> 01:51:22,540
everybody everything.
And it was because he had HIV.

2606
01:51:24,030 --> 01:51:25,990
It's really nuts.
It's,

2607
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:26,943
um,
I was thinking of someone else's story 

2608
01:51:28,451 --> 01:51:31,480
at the same time just then.
It's,

2609
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:32,620
I dunno,
I think,

2610
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,910
I think,
uh,

2611
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,500
we're just so used to this filter that,
that I,

2612
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:38,413
uh,
when someone is just genuinely honest 

2613
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:41,400
and saying,
um,

2614
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:42,633
you know,
that that is actually the s the most 

2615
01:51:44,321 --> 01:51:47,560
powerful thing and it takes all the 
sting out.

2616
01:51:47,561 --> 01:51:49,060
There's no,
you don't get any,

2617
01:51:49,061 --> 01:51:50,440
there's no gossip,
right?

2618
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:51,251
You say,
yeah,

2619
01:51:51,251 --> 01:51:52,084
I did this.
I think people were way more concerned 

2620
01:51:54,071 --> 01:51:55,600
with deception.
Then there are,

2621
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:56,553
they are with folly.
They're way more dis concerned with 

2622
01:51:59,501 --> 01:52:00,334
deception and the are what people 
fucking up with people making mistakes 

2623
01:52:02,741 --> 01:52:03,670
with.
Well,

2624
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:04,930
I think it's funny when,
when,

2625
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:05,793
when people will talk,
I mean not that was a big deal that I 

2626
01:52:07,871 --> 01:52:08,704
set the leno show and fire,
but people now will come up to me and 

2627
01:52:11,801 --> 01:52:12,970
say,
um,

2628
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:15,400
there'll be like,
or,

2629
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:18,460
or stories appear that say I was banned 
from the tonight show.

2630
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:19,451
And it's like,
no,

2631
01:52:19,451 --> 01:52:20,284
it wasn't that you,
you made that step I was on a week 

2632
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:27,190
later.
You decided that.

2633
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:27,930
Right,
right.

2634
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:30,310
That's it.
That's a common thing.

2635
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:31,163
And I was of me.
I see people saying that it was banned 

2636
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:35,870
for I me,
I was laying,

2637
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:36,753
I was banned for a whole seven days.
You lit it on fire and then we me back 

2638
01:52:41,141 --> 01:52:42,130
and we'd just say,
hey man,

2639
01:52:42,131 --> 01:52:42,881
I'm really,
no,

2640
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:44,770
we did it,
you know,

2641
01:52:44,890 --> 01:52:46,050
have you lighting you on fire

2642
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:48,260
now?
He added me back on the show and um,

2643
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:50,870
he asked me,
buried in dirt up to my neck,

2644
01:52:50,871 --> 01:52:52,220
you know,
it was funny.

2645
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,540
You know,
it's so,

2646
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:54,441
it's like,
no,

2647
01:52:54,441 --> 01:52:55,610
it didn't happen.
Right.

2648
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:57,530
It just,
you made the next step,

2649
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,000
you know?
Yeah.

2650
01:52:59,001 --> 01:53:01,380
It's a common thing.
I think we can connect that to big foot.

2651
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:04,370
The people,
they just make shit up.

2652
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:07,160
Right.
All right.

2653
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:10,230
A way to say,
I don't want saying,

2654
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:12,010
I think look,
look,

2655
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:12,883
like,
like I said,

2656
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:17,380
I would lose sleep for days if big foot 
turned out to be true.

2657
01:53:17,381 --> 01:53:19,300
I'd be so happy.
I'll say this then,

2658
01:53:19,301 --> 01:53:20,230
then,
then that's good.

2659
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:21,573
Look if someone hit one with a car and 
he died and they had definitive proof 

2660
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:27,640
that there is a real gigantic pythagoras
and you see some fucking,

2661
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:28,783
you know,
blank cruiser that's smashed by some 

2662
01:53:30,281 --> 01:53:33,220
gigantic ape.
They just wandered out of the forest.

2663
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:34,840
Holy Shit.
I'd be happy.

2664
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,880
Just so happy at despondent one.
Yeah.

2665
01:53:36,910 --> 01:53:37,810
Well not even if it was,
no,

2666
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:38,673
no.
I just jumped in front of a truck going 

2667
01:53:41,321 --> 01:53:46,321
through a bad breakup out loud.
But I think that,

2668
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:49,653
I mean I think I could,
I could honestly say it will be one of 

2669
01:53:53,081 --> 01:53:55,810
the happiest moments in my life if they 
found a big foot,

2670
01:53:55,811 --> 01:53:58,990
if the captured a big foot.
I mean if we were watching on television

2671
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:00,003
and we were seeing like some footage 
from some containment area where they 

2672
01:54:03,731 --> 01:54:08,731
had these giant steel bars like Kong and
they had this huge 10 foot tall one.

2673
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:14,060
I like your,
I like your Harry and the Hendersons a a

2674
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:16,820
one better I have was it just gets hit 
by a car.

2675
01:54:16,830 --> 01:54:18,350
I said what happened in Harry?
In the Henderson.

2676
01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:19,293
Yeah,
but I'm not sure we'd rather have that 

2677
01:54:20,661 --> 01:54:24,320
then.
Then this animal sadly captured,

2678
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,740
well,
one of my favorite hoax stories is a guy

2679
01:54:26,741 --> 01:54:28,420
in Montana.
I'll put a Ghillie suit on.

2680
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:29,260
Oh.
And uh,

2681
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:33,220
tried to fake that he was big foot one 
teenager random over one way,

2682
01:54:33,221 --> 01:54:35,620
and another teenager ran him over the 
other way.

2683
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:38,470
So he got hit on the one side Blam on 
one side of the road,

2684
01:54:38,471 --> 01:54:40,240
then another teenager the other way,
random over.

2685
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:41,380
And that's hilarious.

2686
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:42,241
You know,
it's like,

2687
01:54:42,241 --> 01:54:44,160
well,
he died doing what?

2688
01:54:44,161 --> 01:54:47,670
He loves you.
You know what I mean?

2689
01:54:47,671 --> 01:54:50,550
Like that funeral I had to be like,
you know?

2690
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,350
Yeah.
The chuckles,

2691
01:54:52,351 --> 01:54:54,300
the clown,
the Mary Tyler Moore,

2692
01:54:54,301 --> 01:54:55,710
you know what I mean?
It's like,

2693
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:56,633
yeah,
he was just up trying to fake out the 

2694
01:54:58,740 --> 01:54:59,573
math.
We're in a Ghillie suit hanging out the 

2695
01:55:00,931 --> 01:55:05,931
side of the road is going to be funny.
The lamb girl ran him over.

2696
01:55:07,170 --> 01:55:09,660
She saw a big foot's just turn the wheel
towards him.

2697
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:14,910
Bam.
I think,

2698
01:55:14,911 --> 01:55:16,140
uh,
well,

2699
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:18,290
well,
when we find big foot,

2700
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:19,270
when,
when,

2701
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:20,350
how much confidence?
Yeah,

2702
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:21,780
I'll be,
I'll be back on.

2703
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:22,300
You know,
they,

2704
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:24,600
they're talking about using drones,
sending drones.

2705
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:26,010
Mm.
What were those skies,

2706
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:29,250
but you know that the canopy when,
yeah,

2707
01:55:29,251 --> 01:55:30,084
you wouldn't believe,
see shit.

2708
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:32,870
That's ridiculous.
That's the only,

2709
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:36,350
really the most compelling thing about 
it is that you just,

2710
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:38,150
the,
the territory so dense.

2711
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:40,340
It's so huge and it's nothing,
man.

2712
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:43,950
They don't even have a hair.
Not a single piece of nothing.

2713
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:45,580
Did you ever,
uh,

2714
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,040
do you know about Jimmy Stewart's wife,
Jimmy Stewart,

2715
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:50,760
the comedian,
Jimmy Stewart,

2716
01:55:50,761 --> 01:55:52,860
the actor,
a famous actor,

2717
01:55:52,861 --> 01:55:57,861
comic guy has his wife smuggled a Yeti 
finger out of the inner underpants.

2718
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:02,290
What?
Out of the Himalayas?

2719
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:04,100
You put it in her pussy.
Oh No,

2720
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,230
she put it in their underpants,
but we're all in the back.

2721
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:08,183
No,
isn't he or she wasn't wearing these on 

2722
01:56:09,331 --> 01:56:10,164
the side.
It was like her luggage and she had 

2723
01:56:12,121 --> 01:56:12,980
like,
oh,

2724
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:14,093
and she's confused and she's,
imagine what she smelled like after she 

2725
01:56:16,561 --> 01:56:19,170
got home.
Well,

2726
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:20,033
the Odyssey,
you said this finger come on and she 

2727
01:56:23,581 --> 01:56:25,440
smuggled it.
Uh,

2728
01:56:25,470 --> 01:56:26,303
any researcher Peter Byrne learned of 
the getting hand and the scalp on 

2729
01:56:29,131 --> 01:56:31,050
display.
A remote Buddhist monastery.

2730
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,101
Yeah.
But when they,

2731
01:56:32,101 --> 01:56:34,680
none us than Hollywood actor Jimmy 
Stewart.

2732
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:35,551
Uh,
yeah,

2733
01:56:35,551 --> 01:56:37,440
his wife's smuggled it.
No.

2734
01:56:37,441 --> 01:56:38,274
And then,
and then recently there's been a DNA 

2735
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:42,000
study and it's not a Yeti.

2736
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,520
It was,
what is it?

2737
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:45,300
It's a Buddhist monks hand.
Is that what it is?

2738
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:46,500
So dude,
yeah,

2739
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:47,573
but um,
I'm more fascinated about Jimmy 

2740
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:50,753
Stewart's wife's muck.
Like what she thought was a Yeti and 

2741
01:56:53,701 --> 01:56:55,200
Jimmy Stewart was part of it.
Well,

2742
01:56:55,201 --> 01:56:56,034
how big was the fuck is lauren calling 
involved in this big a Yeti's hands 

2743
01:56:59,881 --> 01:57:00,860
would be,
yeah.

2744
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:02,060
Jesus Christ.
Oh,

2745
01:57:02,061 --> 01:57:02,610
this,
uh,

2746
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:04,830
this monk,
he had a big hands.

2747
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:06,540
Well that was another thing about it 
yet.

2748
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,220
Hold on.
Look at this.

2749
01:57:08,221 --> 01:57:09,450
Jamie.
Google this.

2750
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:10,860
There was a,
um,

2751
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:16,160
they found one of the,
one of the reasons why people saw a Yeti

2752
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:17,993
is that there was a bear in the 
Himalayas that was thought to be long 

2753
01:57:21,241 --> 01:57:24,480
extinct.
And it turns out that it may not be,

2754
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:27,960
and it was a different kind of your 
Asian bear,

2755
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,290
some large base.
Is it a,

2756
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:31,770
is it a white bear?

2757
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:33,060
I mean,
is it like a polar bear?

2758
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:34,620
I don't know.
I don't know.

2759
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:35,760
But you know,
look,

2760
01:57:35,761 --> 01:57:39,270
when you're looking at things in the 
snow was fascinating to me.

2761
01:57:39,271 --> 01:57:40,230
Once I was,
I was,

2762
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:42,930
I was in the woods with these guys and 
there's the,

2763
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:46,110
we're looking at trail cam footage and 
there's a,

2764
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:48,003
this almost looks like a weasel.
It's called a merit and it was supposed 

2765
01:57:52,861 --> 01:57:53,694
to be extinct.
And so this guy showing me this footage 

2766
01:57:57,990 --> 01:57:59,610
and uh,
he,

2767
01:57:59,611 --> 01:58:00,061
she goes,
well,

2768
01:58:00,061 --> 01:58:00,960
yeah,
this is a merit.

2769
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:01,823
You know,
there hasn't been one in 50 years and 

2770
01:58:03,751 --> 01:58:04,584
this and that.
And he goes,

2771
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:08,700
but take a look at the snow.
He buries the lead and he goes,

2772
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,300
this looks like a footprint.
He clicks past it.

2773
01:58:12,990 --> 01:58:16,350
It's like he,
he showed me all this footage,

2774
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:18,350
so you've found that I shouldn't do this
down here.

2775
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:19,440
This must be extinct.
Yeah,

2776
01:58:19,441 --> 01:58:20,900
it's a merit.
And then he'd click,

2777
01:58:20,901 --> 01:58:21,570
click,
click,

2778
01:58:21,570 --> 01:58:22,780
take a look at this.
You know,

2779
01:58:22,890 --> 01:58:23,723
we're looking at a footprint in snow and
not concentrating on the fact that he 

2780
01:58:27,301 --> 01:58:29,430
found an extinct animal.
Swear to God.

2781
01:58:29,490 --> 01:58:33,030
I was like this,
you're burying the lead.

2782
01:58:33,031 --> 01:58:35,400
You found an animal that was supposed to
be dead.

2783
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,420
But we're looking at white might be big 
foot duke.

2784
01:58:39,910 --> 01:58:42,430
What did he absolutely identify

2785
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:43,810
that as a merit though.
Yeah.

2786
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:46,120
Wow.
So this was a huge news.

2787
01:58:46,121 --> 01:58:47,310
Then he,
he,

2788
01:58:47,390 --> 01:58:50,560
he didn't seem to give a rat's ass.
So did he report it?

2789
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:51,670
Yeah,
he did.

2790
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:54,160
So now they know this animal is an 
extinct.

2791
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:55,031
Exactly.
Well,

2792
01:58:55,031 --> 01:58:55,990
there's been some cases,
yeah.

2793
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,050
But you know what I mean?
Oh,

2794
01:58:57,051 --> 01:58:58,210
that happens a lot.
But yeah,

2795
01:58:58,250 --> 01:58:59,160
I mean,
my point is,

2796
01:58:59,161 --> 01:58:59,994
is this is the thing,
as much as I love the big foot 

2797
01:59:02,691 --> 01:59:03,524
community,
I don't know if you've ever gone and 

2798
01:59:05,151 --> 01:59:07,100
tried to get them to talk about anything
else,

2799
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:09,200
then I'll talk about anything else.
They can't.

2800
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:10,940
It's all of a sudden it's like,
it's like,

2801
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:13,860
it's really weird.
Like if you bring up something,

2802
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:14,211
say,
Hey,

2803
01:59:14,211 --> 01:59:17,870
do you guys see the new yeah.
Adventures movie.

2804
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,730
What's so compelling to them?

2805
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:24,220
This is this thing that they'd been 
searching with no reward.

2806
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:25,293
There's no reward.
And they keep looking and it never 

2807
01:59:26,741 --> 01:59:27,840
happened.
Whether it's the women.

2808
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:29,200
Okay.

2809
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:30,690
The,
the big foot community women.

2810
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:31,860
Yeah.
But you know,

2811
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:36,550
they just did it and they're like rupees
in the big foot man.

2812
01:59:36,990 --> 01:59:39,060
I told the women that went with me,
I said,

2813
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:41,190
Oh really?
You know,

2814
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:44,640
which just don't,
no neck lines.

2815
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:46,700
You guys aren't going to get out of 
there a lot.

2816
01:59:46,710 --> 01:59:48,030
You've got a it up.
Yeah,

2817
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:49,793
I really did.
I said I though you haven't gotten any 

2818
01:59:51,301 --> 01:59:55,080
one of these before.
I don't want to see anyone's figures.

2819
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:56,220
Um,
yeah.

2820
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:58,170
What is the most compelling thing to 
you?

2821
01:59:58,171 --> 02:00:01,770
Is is eye witness evidence or is there I
love that.

2822
02:00:01,771 --> 02:00:03,980
Even if someone's lying to me,
if,

2823
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:05,640
if that's the case,
I,

2824
02:00:05,641 --> 02:00:09,150
I don't the listening to someone telling
me a story that,

2825
02:00:09,630 --> 02:00:12,180
that uh,
they believe is true.

2826
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:14,160
I don't think it's someone lying.

2827
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:15,433
It's my favorite part of finding big 
foot when they go to some town 

2828
02:00:18,051 --> 02:00:18,970
community,
uh,

2829
02:00:19,190 --> 02:00:20,023
some community and some small town and 
they start talking to them and the 

2830
02:00:22,341 --> 02:00:25,920
community center and ask them,
how many of you here have had a big foot

2831
02:00:25,921 --> 02:00:27,590
and counter and they know the camera's 
there,

2832
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:28,433
sir.
All like

2833
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:31,990
they'll raise their hand.
When we were doing this thing,

2834
02:00:31,991 --> 02:00:32,824
I was doing this thing for CBS.
It's called game show in my head and 

2835
02:00:34,931 --> 02:00:36,250
what it was is we,
it was a game show.

2836
02:00:36,251 --> 02:00:39,040
We put this little earpiece in people 
and the game shows.

2837
02:00:39,041 --> 02:00:42,970
We would send them out into a pre,
we created this scenario.

2838
02:00:43,090 --> 02:00:45,010
They didn't know what it was going to be
until they got out there,

2839
02:00:45,011 --> 02:00:46,780
so they'd be standing there and then I'd
say,

2840
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:47,770
all right,
here's the deal.

2841
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:48,723
You are a news reporter and you have 
been sent here to do report on someone 

2842
02:00:53,891 --> 02:00:58,891
who has seen a Ufo.
The problem is that person took off,

2843
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:00,543
so you need to find a person on the 
street that will admit that they saw a 

2844
02:01:03,581 --> 02:01:08,230
Ufo and they have to tell you that they 
were taking a board that Ufo and probed.

2845
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:10,390
If you can get someone to do that on 
camera,

2846
02:01:10,570 --> 02:01:13,750
you'll win you and you make the money 
because it was like a series of tasks,

2847
02:01:13,790 --> 02:01:14,623
right?
Yeah.

2848
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:16,240
They all did it.
Yeah.

2849
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,100
Every one of the ass did it.
They all fucking did it.

2850
02:01:18,101 --> 02:01:18,934
And I was watching these people and that
was the first draw in what broke the 

2851
02:01:22,331 --> 02:01:23,164
camel's back to me that a lot of these 
stories are bullshit because I was 

2852
02:01:26,381 --> 02:01:30,670
watching these people come up with these
fucking stories on the fly.

2853
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:31,753
They weren't actors.
They weren't alerted of it in advance 

2854
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:35,950
where they prepared a story.
They just,

2855
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:37,570
Hey,
I'm in a bind.

2856
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:38,520
I'm a report.
Right.

2857
02:01:38,590 --> 02:01:41,720
We were sent down here and these people 
just ran out years ago.

2858
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:43,760
Tom Kenny did that for,
uh,

2859
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:44,960
he would,
uh,

2860
02:01:44,961 --> 02:01:48,020
ask people,
he was doing the same thing,

2861
02:01:48,021 --> 02:01:50,130
saying that there's this new movie 
coming out.

2862
02:01:50,131 --> 02:01:54,410
It's during Danny to be.
So if he would just keep piling on,

2863
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:55,700
then they go,
oh,

2864
02:01:55,701 --> 02:01:58,690
daddy is so funny.
I know it's,

2865
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,133
his mother dies.
It's so sad seeing Danny devito that 

2866
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:05,810
would just change it.
They would,

2867
02:02:05,811 --> 02:02:06,371
yeah,
they were.

2868
02:02:06,371 --> 02:02:07,670
Yeah.
It's a,

2869
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:09,110
yeah.

2870
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:09,943
If people find out that they're going to
be interviewed and they find out that 

2871
02:02:12,261 --> 02:02:13,094
they're on camera,
they will do all kinds of crazy things 

2872
02:02:16,671 --> 02:02:19,160
to comply with whatever the narrative 
is,

2873
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:21,140
is real weird,
man.

2874
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:22,273
And so when you're interviewing people 
and ask them about Ufo shows or asked 

2875
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:28,490
him about big foot,
just the camera and the fact that you're

2876
02:02:28,491 --> 02:02:32,090
filming alone,
it changes the reality of whatever their

2877
02:02:32,091 --> 02:02:33,640
story would or wouldn't be.
It,

2878
02:02:33,641 --> 02:02:35,420
it changes,
it gets adjusted.

2879
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:36,463
It,
it becomes a giant factor in whatever 

2880
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:42,440
the story is.
The fact that there's a camera on them.

2881
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:44,083
Well,
I believe on the other side of things 

2882
02:02:46,101 --> 02:02:47,430
doing like,
um,

2883
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:51,590
after doing call me lucky,
I learned a lot about,

2884
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:53,420
uh,
and you probably know this,

2885
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,870
obviously I already,
most people want to tell you their story

2886
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:59,120
and most people do.
You know what I mean?

2887
02:02:59,121 --> 02:03:02,180
If,
if you don't even have to do too much,

2888
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:04,160
you don't have to make someone 
uncomfortable.

2889
02:03:04,161 --> 02:03:05,990
You don't have to even be probing too 
much.

2890
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:07,063
Most people do want to be heard.
Most people will tell you really 

2891
02:03:09,441 --> 02:03:11,060
personal things.
I'm not talking about Barry,

2892
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:13,020
but I'm talking about the other folks 
that supported the move.

2893
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:15,470
Um,
uh,

2894
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:16,333
and I learned when I was doing that doc 
that the key was that I had a shut up 

2895
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:24,050
and I had a listen,
which as a nightclub comedian was really

2896
02:03:24,051 --> 02:03:29,051
hard.
How about that?

2897
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:31,730
Oh shoot.
I got to wrap up.

2898
02:03:31,731 --> 02:03:32,564
I was,
okay.

2899
02:03:32,770 --> 02:03:35,210
Well let me just bring up this topic.
You're on the road a lot.

2900
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:37,670
When guys come in,
the end,

2901
02:03:37,671 --> 02:03:39,530
women,
they come in the green room and there,

2902
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:40,730
you know,
you're in their club,

2903
02:03:40,731 --> 02:03:41,564
you're in their home town and there's a 
whole bunch of local guys and they're 

2904
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,593
nice and stuff.
But when they start talking about 

2905
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:48,193
standup,
does it bore you to tears or are you 

2906
02:03:51,501 --> 02:03:52,334
engaged in it?

2907
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:55,900
Um,
it really depends.

2908
02:03:56,110 --> 02:03:58,060
Like who's coming in the green room.
Other comics.

2909
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

2910
02:03:59,210 --> 02:04:00,043
They,
they want to come up and they want to 

2911
02:04:01,041 --> 02:04:05,030
start talking to me about comedy and 
talking smack about other comics and I'm

2912
02:04:05,031 --> 02:04:06,230
laying,
I'm like,

2913
02:04:06,231 --> 02:04:08,990
if you have any idea how much I'm 
checked out right now,

2914
02:04:09,590 --> 02:04:13,250
well for me the real problem is like 
green rooms before a show.

2915
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:14,860
Yeah.
I'm trying to get my head together.

2916
02:04:14,930 --> 02:04:18,290
I'm not really in talking to anybody.
I'm into going over my notes.

2917
02:04:18,310 --> 02:04:19,720
Yeah.
Figuring I want to do with the show.

2918
02:04:19,770 --> 02:04:20,603
Yeah.
So if someone comes in and they get in 

2919
02:04:22,401 --> 02:04:24,500
the way,
like that's my goal,

2920
02:04:24,501 --> 02:04:25,790
you actually say,
hey man,

2921
02:04:25,791 --> 02:04:28,270
step out.
I don't usually have very many people

2922
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:29,461
really.
I am,

2923
02:04:29,461 --> 02:04:32,160
I'm always hosting this thing.
I don't know what it is.

2924
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:34,620
And I'm always just like,
I,

2925
02:04:34,621 --> 02:04:35,454
I'll tell,
I will talk about anything other than 

2926
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:38,303
that.
And,

2927
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:40,980
and,
and I shouldn't admit this publicly,

2928
02:04:40,981 --> 02:04:41,830
but,
but,

2929
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:45,240
but when people come up to me and they 
bring up police academy,

2930
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:47,930
Swell,
yeah.

2931
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:50,900
Often,
often I'm,

2932
02:04:50,901 --> 02:04:51,734
I'm,
I'm thinking of committing Harry caray 

2933
02:04:53,480 --> 02:04:55,280
while they're talking to me and I'm not 
even kidding you.

2934
02:04:55,281 --> 02:04:56,270
Like I said,
oh,

2935
02:04:56,271 --> 02:04:57,980
that's great.
How old were you when you saw it?

2936
02:04:57,981 --> 02:04:59,060
And I'm just thinking that,
um,

2937
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:00,433
I know I'm really,
and I'm pulling my end trails out under 

2938
02:05:02,121 --> 02:05:02,954
their shoes.
That's the thought that carries you 

2939
02:05:05,001 --> 02:05:06,500
through the conversation.
It makes me laugh.

2940
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:07,680
Like I'm thinking.
Yeah.

2941
02:05:07,910 --> 02:05:09,020
I'm thinking,
oh,

2942
02:05:09,021 --> 02:05:10,100
that's great.
I'm glad you,

2943
02:05:11,030 --> 02:05:11,863
I'm glad you liked it.
And I'm just thinking that I'm pulling 

2944
02:05:13,551 --> 02:05:16,580
my small intestine all over their feet.
Know there's,

2945
02:05:17,050 --> 02:05:18,890
you just kind of eat what you,
we all do.

2946
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:19,813
We all have that meets your factory or 
faculty to start talking about most 

2947
02:05:21,981 --> 02:05:22,814
sure.
Fire.

2948
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:24,010
You're polite.
Yeah.

2949
02:05:24,110 --> 02:05:24,980
Oh cool man.
Thanks.

2950
02:05:24,981 --> 02:05:27,480
I'm glad you like the show.
But then after a while you're like,

2951
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:28,370
you have a lot of people.

2952
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:29,203
It's like when they were kids,
they were like in high school and you 

2953
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:31,580
know,
fear factor for me,

2954
02:05:31,581 --> 02:05:33,800
they told me how tall they were.
I was this big.

2955
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:35,091
Why?
Why?

2956
02:05:35,091 --> 02:05:39,350
Why would I give a fuck about how tall 
you were when you watch police academy?

2957
02:05:39,530 --> 02:05:40,363
Why?
Why,

2958
02:05:40,370 --> 02:05:43,490
what?
What do you like talking to comics?

2959
02:05:43,540 --> 02:05:47,330
I'm like peers about standup.
Like if you run into someone who's like,

2960
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,890
no,
I just shoved it.

2961
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:49,820
Talking about,
it's like,

2962
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:50,713
yeah,
it's like,

2963
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:52,850
it's like talking about fucking,
it's like,

2964
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:53,863
you know,
you don't like talking about like the 

2965
02:05:55,221 --> 02:05:56,054
creative process or writing or 
roadblocks or motivation or anything 

2966
02:05:59,781 --> 02:06:00,614
like that?
No,

2967
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:02,630
I just don't like talking about,
it's just,

2968
02:06:02,660 --> 02:06:05,150
it's just,
it's this

2969
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:06,630
thing and it's,
it's,

2970
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:09,300
I don't,
I don't feel like gossiping about it.

2971
02:06:09,450 --> 02:06:11,250
I like telling stories.
I love,

2972
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:13,860
I love hearing the funny stories back 
and forth.

2973
02:06:13,861 --> 02:06:15,390
That's great.
A lot of laughs.

2974
02:06:15,391 --> 02:06:18,050
But dissecting comedy for some reason 
is,

2975
02:06:18,110 --> 02:06:18,780
is,
is,

2976
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:19,740
it's just,
it's,

2977
02:06:19,741 --> 02:06:20,574
it's so

2978
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,500
uninteresting to me.
That's,

2979
02:06:22,501 --> 02:06:23,131
well,
you know,

2980
02:06:23,131 --> 02:06:24,780
it's understandable.
I mean,

2981
02:06:24,781 --> 02:06:25,614
what'd you start in like 81 or something
like that and when you might start with 

2982
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:30,300
15 and 60,
I got let her mom was 20.

2983
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:31,620
How old was,
I mean,

2984
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:33,570
what year was that?
Uh,

2985
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:35,040
it was probably like 80 to,
yeah.

2986
02:06:35,110 --> 02:06:38,160
Think about that man.
That is a long fucking time.

2987
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:39,053
Yeah.
You know,

2988
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:41,040
I mean it only makes sense.
He would be born with it,

2989
02:06:41,530 --> 02:06:43,170
but,
but you still enjoy doing it.

2990
02:06:43,650 --> 02:06:44,483
I do see,
so just started to like it when I 

2991
02:06:47,641 --> 02:06:50,700
jettison the persona.
I even remember that.

2992
02:06:50,701 --> 02:06:53,370
Like I thought I hated,
I thought I hated

2993
02:06:53,740 --> 02:06:54,573
the wacky morning shows and you know,
taint and tea bag in the morning and I 

2994
02:06:57,461 --> 02:06:59,290
thought I hated,
you know.

2995
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:00,620
All right.

2996
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:02,870
That stuff in the clubs and this and 
that.

2997
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:04,071
And it's was just like,
oh,

2998
02:07:04,071 --> 02:07:05,310
I hate this character.
I,

2999
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:08,420
I remembered the day it happened.
Like it was like an epiphany.

3000
02:07:08,421 --> 02:07:12,050
I was at xannies and Nashville's loved 
that place and I was like,

3001
02:07:12,230 --> 02:07:14,240
I,
and I knew that I couldn't do it.

3002
02:07:14,241 --> 02:07:15,830
I had to go on as me

3003
02:07:16,650 --> 02:07:19,980
and I made that decision.
And so you went on door yelling,

3004
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:20,840
you know,
do the boy.

3005
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:22,200
Really?
Yeah,

3006
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:23,130
yeah,
yeah.

3007
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:24,480
And it was,
uh,

3008
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:26,710
it changed everything shifted after 
that.

3009
02:07:26,711 --> 02:07:29,320
And then I started this,
uh,

3010
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:31,710
probably like 10 years ago,
maybe,

3011
02:07:31,711 --> 02:07:34,210
maybe longer.
Yeah,

3012
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:35,970
I would say it's probably,
yeah,

3013
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:39,220
around 10 years ago and the,
and it changed for me

3014
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:42,190
and then I liked it again.
That's cool.

3015
02:07:42,370 --> 02:07:43,203
Well you,
there's some guys who just get trapped 

3016
02:07:44,051 --> 02:07:44,884
in a persona.
We were just talking about emo phillips 

3017
02:07:46,031 --> 02:07:46,864
the other night,
cause emo Philips is apparently back to 

3018
02:07:48,671 --> 02:07:51,940
his persona.
He let it go for a long time and he just

3019
02:07:51,941 --> 02:07:54,610
started just being a guy on stage 
talking about shit.

3020
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:57,790
Apparently the people weren't into that.
He's like,

3021
02:07:57,810 --> 02:07:59,810
all right,
give the people what they want.

3022
02:07:59,830 --> 02:08:02,950
The story I tell about,
I should just clarify this is,

3023
02:08:02,951 --> 02:08:04,390
which is what I've heard.
I haven't seen him,

3024
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:05,980
but this is like,
um,

3025
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:08,710
you know,
robin was a,

3026
02:08:08,810 --> 02:08:10,930
Williams was my best pal and,
and uh,

3027
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:13,360
he got me a job on,
on,

3028
02:08:13,361 --> 02:08:15,730
uh,
a snickers cumbersome and I needed bread

3029
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:17,680
and he was so nice.
He's like,

3030
02:08:17,681 --> 02:08:18,514
Oh,
you know,

3031
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:20,000
so I want you to use my friend,
you know,

3032
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:20,681
Bobcat,
you know,

3033
02:08:20,681 --> 02:08:21,700
he's gotta be in it,
you know,

3034
02:08:21,701 --> 02:08:23,410
and they're like,
and they're like,

3035
02:08:23,470 --> 02:08:24,303
you know,
he actually put their feet on the fire 

3036
02:08:27,071 --> 02:08:29,830
and they had a hire me and then he goes,
he's like,

3037
02:08:29,831 --> 02:08:30,820
don't take the first money.

3038
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:31,960
Just the way,
you know,

3039
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:34,900
tell him no.
So I tell them no.

3040
02:08:34,901 --> 02:08:37,220
And then they came back with more than 
when I,

3041
02:08:37,221 --> 02:08:38,080
you know,
I mean,

3042
02:08:38,081 --> 02:08:38,891
he was great.
Right,

3043
02:08:38,891 --> 02:08:40,190
right.
So then he calls what,

3044
02:08:40,230 --> 02:08:41,063
because you know,
they're going to want you to do the 

3045
02:08:41,711 --> 02:08:43,180
voice.
Are you okay doing the voice?

3046
02:08:43,990 --> 02:08:46,330
And I go for the amount of money 
snickers is paying.

3047
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:50,890
I will fuck a snickers behind camera.
By the way,

3048
02:08:50,891 --> 02:08:55,891
I should say it's really good candy,
but it's my all time favorite.

3049
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:58,001
You know,
I,

3050
02:08:58,001 --> 02:08:59,560
I said I was going to go,
but there's something,

3051
02:08:59,690 --> 02:09:00,200
well,

3052
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:02,090
we'll address a little bit and talk 
about,

3053
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:03,260
you know,
robin had,

3054
02:09:03,261 --> 02:09:03,970
um,
his,

3055
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:08,950
his coroner's report came out and he had
lewy body dementia and that is a,

3056
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:09,933
it's a form of dementia that is very 
rarely ever discovered when someone's 

3057
02:09:15,111 --> 02:09:17,750
alive.
It's usually discovered in there.

3058
02:09:17,810 --> 02:09:22,310
They're a autopsy.
So he had this form of dementia.

3059
02:09:22,311 --> 02:09:27,260
I witnessed it.
It was missed a diagnosis.

3060
02:09:27,261 --> 02:09:29,010
Parkinson's.
Ah,

3061
02:09:29,390 --> 02:09:30,223
and I,
I witnessed this eye witnesses 

3062
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:37,390
processing reality completely different 
than the way every body else does.

3063
02:09:37,611 --> 02:09:39,650
What causes it?
It's,

3064
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:42,310
um,
I'm not sure if it's a gene or what,

3065
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,480
but I mean it is,
sadly,

3066
02:09:44,481 --> 02:09:48,530
his brain was riddled with this.
And so when I think about that,

3067
02:09:48,531 --> 02:09:52,610
I think about how strong he was.
You know,

3068
02:09:52,611 --> 02:09:53,444
you would have like some days,
you'd have a lot of days where he was 

3069
02:09:57,380 --> 02:10:02,010
doing kind of ocd stuff and processing 
things incorrectly,

3070
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:03,980
but then you'd have a day where he was 
back.

3071
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:07,910
So you'd go,
oh well maybe set a bad day or no,

3072
02:10:07,911 --> 02:10:11,330
maybe it's the Parkinson's drugs and 
they've got to get those dialed in.

3073
02:10:11,331 --> 02:10:12,080
You know,
he had,

3074
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:14,720
he was going to doctors use in therapy,
he was doing,

3075
02:10:15,020 --> 02:10:15,853
and it just,
the only reason I talk about that this 

3076
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:20,420
is his brain was giving him 
misinformation,

3077
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:22,310
completeness,
Information.

3078
02:10:23,180 --> 02:10:28,180
And I don't if some people die from 
depression and uh,

3079
02:10:29,450 --> 02:10:32,120
and my heart goes out to them,
but that's not what killed him.

3080
02:10:32,121 --> 02:10:33,160
He,
he,

3081
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:34,273
he really was getting misinformation 
from his own brain and was suffering 

3082
02:10:37,701 --> 02:10:38,534
from this disease.
So I just put that out there because I 

3083
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:44,160
have folks know that we were friends in 
there.

3084
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:46,220
They'll ask me about it and,
and,

3085
02:10:46,290 --> 02:10:50,390
and I would like a spotlight put on the 
disease.

3086
02:10:50,391 --> 02:10:55,391
That actually in my mind was what was 
responsible for his demise.

3087
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:58,490
Cause you know,
a lot of people say,

3088
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:00,150
did he ever talk about suicide?

3089
02:11:00,150 --> 02:11:01,350
I go,
what comics?

3090
02:11:01,351 --> 02:11:06,090
We talked about suicide for 33 years.
Sometimes we talk about other shit,

3091
02:11:06,091 --> 02:11:07,530
you know,
hey,

3092
02:11:07,531 --> 02:11:09,690
congratulations on the ASCA.
Oh thank you.

3093
02:11:09,691 --> 02:11:10,530
How would you do it?
I don't know.

3094
02:11:10,531 --> 02:11:12,770
I think a car,
you know,

3095
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:15,690
but I just say that because he fought,
you know,

3096
02:11:15,691 --> 02:11:17,220
that's what we do.
I don't know about you,

3097
02:11:17,221 --> 02:11:19,140
but a comic,
that's what we do.

3098
02:11:19,141 --> 02:11:21,450
We fight depression.
Things don't add up.

3099
02:11:21,870 --> 02:11:23,490
It doesn't,
this world doesn't seem right.

3100
02:11:23,491 --> 02:11:28,350
And we go out and we spew about it and I
feel better on a selfish level.

3101
02:11:28,351 --> 02:11:31,970
I don't really give a rat's ass,
you know,

3102
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:34,620
I vent and I feel like better.
And,

3103
02:11:34,670 --> 02:11:37,380
and,
and he fought it.

3104
02:11:37,410 --> 02:11:40,020
And that wasn't,
it wasn't depression.

3105
02:11:40,021 --> 02:11:41,130
It wasn't career.
It wasn't,

3106
02:11:41,630 --> 02:11:44,130
you know,
he'd been sober most of his adult life,

3107
02:11:44,210 --> 02:11:44,950
you know,
so,

3108
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:45,783
so it's very disturbing to me that a lot
of people were trying to attribute all 

3109
02:11:48,581 --> 02:11:50,500
sorts of reasons for why he did it.

3110
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:52,540
And even there was a lot of like,
um,

3111
02:11:52,810 --> 02:11:53,643
well that's the main things.
Rights groups that were attributing it 

3112
02:11:56,110 --> 02:11:56,943
to,
uh,

3113
02:11:56,950 --> 02:11:58,800
his divorce settlements,
brother.

3114
02:11:58,960 --> 02:11:59,793
Yeah.
There was a whole thing where this guy 

3115
02:12:01,391 --> 02:12:05,120
was doing this video and I even talked 
to them about it.

3116
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,770
It's,
he had,

3117
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:10,770
uh,
the disease.

3118
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:15,660
He had a disease that caused dementia 
that I witnessed.

3119
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:18,180
I didn't have anybody.
I talked to him more,

3120
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:23,430
you know,
I talked to him and text and every day I

3121
02:12:23,431 --> 02:12:25,200
didn't have a buddy that I talked to him
more.

3122
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:30,530
So just to be it,
it wasn't a divorce,

3123
02:12:31,940 --> 02:12:34,130
it wasn't his family,
wasn't it?

3124
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:37,210
We have the same agent.
So like when this guy was saying,

3125
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:38,063
well,
this is one of the reason why it pissed 

3126
02:12:38,491 --> 02:12:39,960
me off because this guy was saying that,
you know,

3127
02:12:39,961 --> 02:12:41,670
he's in financial ruins.
Like,

3128
02:12:41,671 --> 02:12:42,330
no,
he wasn't.

3129
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:43,620
No,
he was wealthy.

3130
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:44,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

3131
02:12:44,551 --> 02:12:46,080
And also it's,
it's,

3132
02:12:46,081 --> 02:12:47,730
uh,
it's,

3133
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:48,510
yeah,
I mean,

3134
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:49,700
no one wants to,
uh,

3135
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:53,390
because as human beings,
we're trying to make sense of,

3136
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:54,410
of,
of,

3137
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:55,303
of one why,
why that happened and why that happened 

3138
02:12:58,710 --> 02:13:01,110
in my opinion,
which is right.

3139
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,230
What's his brain was with no more than 
you,

3140
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:06,090
it was,
his brain was getting,

3141
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:07,383
uh,
misinformation and he was processing 

3142
02:13:09,721 --> 02:13:11,250
reality completely wrong.
I mean,

3143
02:13:11,251 --> 02:13:13,080
I,
I won't go into details,

3144
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:14,213
but I did witness him thinking things 
that weren't real were happening to me 

3145
02:13:22,111 --> 02:13:23,760
in the middle of the night.
And that's the other thing,

3146
02:13:23,761 --> 02:13:24,391
like people say,
oh,

3147
02:13:24,391 --> 02:13:26,130
he wasn't in the same bedroom as his 
wife.

3148
02:13:26,131 --> 02:13:26,551
It's like,
yeah,

3149
02:13:26,551 --> 02:13:29,220
because he was having seizures and he 
didn't like to wake her up.

3150
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:30,713
Oh God.
It's not a of somebody not getting 

3151
02:13:33,151 --> 02:13:35,100
along.
I didn't mean to get so personal.

3152
02:13:35,210 --> 02:13:36,043
They don't mean it.
And I don't mean to talk about about 

3153
02:13:38,131 --> 02:13:38,840
his,
his,

3154
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:42,240
uh,
his home life because you know,

3155
02:13:42,610 --> 02:13:46,170
Susan's a wonderful Gal and,
and,

3156
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:48,660
and it's just sad,
you know?

3157
02:13:50,050 --> 02:13:50,970
No,
it's awful.

3158
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:51,863
That's the,
one of the scariest things is I'm 

3159
02:13:53,730 --> 02:13:56,490
talking to someone who's,
whether it's a loved one,

3160
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:59,730
a father,
mother that's losing their grip.

3161
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:03,780
And I think people were s they were 
courteous to a point,

3162
02:14:03,781 --> 02:14:04,614
but I don't think they take his,
his kids and the consideration and 

3163
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:12,150
friends and people worked with him for 
all these years.

3164
02:14:12,151 --> 02:14:14,040
And I guess I can't expect them to,
you know,

3165
02:14:14,041 --> 02:14:16,830
I mean I'm sure I've taken shots at 
people when they pass away,

3166
02:14:16,831 --> 02:14:17,664
but it's just,
it's like people would come up and they 

3167
02:14:20,161 --> 02:14:21,150
go,
did you hear?

3168
02:14:21,151 --> 02:14:23,820
What did you,
what rush limbaugh said?

3169
02:14:23,821 --> 02:14:25,620
And I'd be like,
I don't care.

3170
02:14:25,621 --> 02:14:26,454
What were some of the says?
I'm dealing with people who dealt with 

3171
02:14:29,371 --> 02:14:31,560
them on a daily basis.
Let me ask you this,

3172
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:35,400
what is it?
What is this impulse that people have to

3173
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:37,920
denigrate people right after they die?

3174
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:41,970
It's almost like everyone else is,
everyone else is talking about that.

3175
02:14:41,971 --> 02:14:42,804
Like I saw a lot of that with prince 
when it was revealed that prince was 

3176
02:14:46,051 --> 02:14:49,380
suffering through opiate addiction.
Yeah.

3177
02:14:49,710 --> 02:14:50,543
And I was like,
well there was like gene Simmons said 

3178
02:14:52,291 --> 02:14:53,124
some crazy shit and he had to apologize 
and I'd seen some other people say it 

3179
02:14:56,321 --> 02:14:59,340
too.
But what it's almost like it's a crunch,

3180
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:02,310
a contrarian thing.
Like everyone else is saying,

3181
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,050
oh yeah,
we lost his genius.

3182
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:07,830
Well you get heat from it.
And I'm sure in Gene Simmons is,

3183
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:10,710
you know,
I'm sure there's a jealousy thing,

3184
02:15:10,711 --> 02:15:11,670
but you say,
look,

3185
02:15:11,671 --> 02:15:12,504
I used to say outrageous things about 
people and this bomb would go off and I 

3186
02:15:16,621 --> 02:15:18,750
would get,
I would get some heat and now I get some

3187
02:15:18,751 --> 02:15:22,430
buzz and I stopped doing that.
I made a decision,

3188
02:15:22,910 --> 02:15:23,743
you know,
realizing that these weren't just a 

3189
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:27,600
harmless things I was saying.

3190
02:15:27,630 --> 02:15:28,290
Right,
right,

3191
02:15:28,290 --> 02:15:29,071
right.
You just,

3192
02:15:29,071 --> 02:15:30,560
yeah.
Yeah.

3193
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:33,210
You know,
it was,

3194
02:15:34,650 --> 02:15:35,483
yeah.
Cause there are a lot of that when Kurt 

3195
02:15:36,121 --> 02:15:38,400
cobain died too.
But you know,

3196
02:15:38,401 --> 02:15:42,600
and that's the W W W W I wasn't best 
these with Kurt,

3197
02:15:42,630 --> 02:15:45,570
but I did know him.
I toured with Nirvana,

3198
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:46,403
Kurt,
like my standup and asked me to go on 

3199
02:15:47,671 --> 02:15:48,504
the road with them.
I did a bunch of days then we talked 

3200
02:15:50,671 --> 02:15:51,420
about it.
But,

3201
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:52,253
but I,
I mean it wasn't like the situation was 

3202
02:15:53,881 --> 02:15:54,660
wrong,
but,

3203
02:15:54,660 --> 02:15:55,493
but I did have times in my life where I 
spent hours with Kurt when the o 

3204
02:15:59,981 --> 02:16:02,970
announce sitting around talking and 
laughing,

3205
02:16:03,030 --> 02:16:05,040
you know,
um,

3206
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:07,710
I don't know why we want to do that.
I think,

3207
02:16:07,711 --> 02:16:11,840
I think,
I think we try to make sense of it.

3208
02:16:11,860 --> 02:16:13,710
I think we tried to make sense of it,
I think.

3209
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:16,770
I think that's where a lot of 
conspiracies come from.

3210
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:17,603
I think when when someone who's in our 
mind reach the American dream and then 

3211
02:16:22,591 --> 02:16:26,790
they die or look or come or take their 
life or overdose,

3212
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:28,351
we have to say,
well,

3213
02:16:28,351 --> 02:16:29,184
they had it all and that's what we 
believe is the ultimate fulfillment and 

3214
02:16:33,071 --> 02:16:33,940
happiness.
You know,

3215
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:37,060
America is the People's Republic of 
spring break.

3216
02:16:37,061 --> 02:16:39,010
You know,
where no one's pursuing fulfillment.

3217
02:16:39,011 --> 02:16:42,010
Everyone's pursuing happiness.
You know,

3218
02:16:42,011 --> 02:16:44,980
there's two different things.
I'm really fulfilled.

3219
02:16:44,981 --> 02:16:46,780
Am I happy?
Am I laughing all day?

3220
02:16:46,781 --> 02:16:49,300
Am I know?
But you're happy sometimes I'm happy.

3221
02:16:49,301 --> 02:16:50,134
A lot of the time I've never not talk.
Like if I didn't know that you're this 

3222
02:16:54,191 --> 02:16:55,024
nuance guy that's very thoughtful and 
you have a lot of opinions and you're 

3223
02:16:57,851 --> 02:17:00,430
always considering all answered.
If I just took,

3224
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:05,460
like if I tried to form a view of you 
based on you and I talking,

3225
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:07,360
we're always laughing.
Yeah.

3226
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:08,380
I would say bobcat.

3227
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:10,420
So jolly.
Every time we talk to them,

3228
02:17:10,421 --> 02:17:14,170
it's like laughs and hugs and,
but it is true and it's,

3229
02:17:14,260 --> 02:17:16,200
and it's uh,
uh,

3230
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:18,250
cause we never see each other before 
noon,

3231
02:17:18,310 --> 02:17:22,060
first of all.
But it's a,

3232
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:24,730
it's a,
it's a daily reprieve.

3233
02:17:24,731 --> 02:17:26,800
It's a daily decision.
You know,

3234
02:17:26,801 --> 02:17:30,700
I get up,
the squirrels are up before I do and I,

3235
02:17:30,701 --> 02:17:35,230
and I beat him down and then it turns 
and when I'm directing on a set,

3236
02:17:35,231 --> 02:17:36,064
I'm like,
I can react and fear or I can just sit 

3237
02:17:38,651 --> 02:17:41,860
here for a second or two in.
It all usually works out.

3238
02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:44,410
Very rarely do I have to say no.
Go Man,

3239
02:17:44,470 --> 02:17:46,030
this is,
you just sit there.

3240
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:47,283
I think so much of show business,
everything's based on fear and people 

3241
02:17:50,321 --> 02:17:51,154
thinking someone's going to say you 
screwed up or you didn't do it right or 

3242
02:17:53,171 --> 02:17:55,090
you didn't get extra takes and all that 
stuff.

3243
02:17:55,570 --> 02:17:59,140
But man,
my job is really not to to freak out.

3244
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:02,050
Hmm.
I really happy right now.

3245
02:18:02,770 --> 02:18:03,910
Well that's beautiful,
man.

3246
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:06,340
I think you're doing some awesome work.
I really do.

3247
02:18:06,610 --> 02:18:09,730
I have to quit.
You know,

3248
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:12,040
because that's again,
that's very an American.

3249
02:18:12,050 --> 02:18:13,450
You never quit.
Never give up.

3250
02:18:13,451 --> 02:18:14,410
It's like quit,
quit,

3251
02:18:14,411 --> 02:18:15,041
quit,
quit.

3252
02:18:15,041 --> 02:18:18,160
And then until you end up someplace 
where you don't want to leave,

3253
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,980
and that's what I've done.
Quit everything.

3254
02:18:20,981 --> 02:18:22,690
That doesn't feel right.
That doesn't,

3255
02:18:22,691 --> 02:18:23,524
you know,
when,

3256
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:26,260
when I made the decision not to go on 
auditions,

3257
02:18:26,410 --> 02:18:29,350
it was scary and it became the best 
thing that ever happened to me.

3258
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:32,740
All of a sudden I'm freed up and I'm 
writing screenplays and I'm doing,

3259
02:18:32,770 --> 02:18:34,180
you know,
it's like,

3260
02:18:34,181 --> 02:18:35,470
what am I trying to get on?
You know,

3261
02:18:35,471 --> 02:18:37,550
who's your daddy or whatever the fuck.
You know what I mean?

3262
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:40,360
A burden the hand or whatever the fuck.

3263
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:41,440
You know,
what am I doing?

3264
02:18:41,940 --> 02:18:44,030
What am I doing?
You know,

3265
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:46,810
but,
but you find your voice,

3266
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:47,590
you know,
I mean,

3267
02:18:47,590 --> 02:18:50,320
it's interesting now to,
to see the stuff you're doing.

3268
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:51,213
And the funny thing to me is like 
someone in interviews and cause I make 

3269
02:18:54,680 --> 02:18:56,500
about a movie every year,
a year and a half.

3270
02:18:56,501 --> 02:18:57,280
And they're like,
so,

3271
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:59,040
so what is the,
you know,

3272
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:00,840
what is,
who is,

3273
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:01,713
who are you competing with?
What other filmmaker you competing with 

3274
02:19:04,031 --> 02:19:05,080
them?
I'm like,

3275
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:07,120
I'm competing with the grim fucking 
reaper.

3276
02:19:07,121 --> 02:19:10,420
I just figured this out like 10 years 
ago.

3277
02:19:10,421 --> 02:19:11,590
What I want to do,
you know?

3278
02:19:11,591 --> 02:19:12,360
That's,
that's,

3279
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:14,770
that's what motivates me.
I got a hold of you now.

3280
02:19:15,010 --> 02:19:17,780
I'm 53 I'll be 54 and so like when you 
run,

3281
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:19,750
run,
you hit 40 like Uga,

3282
02:19:19,751 --> 02:19:22,660
this father fucking things ticking.
Oh Man.

3283
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:24,000
You know,
and I,

3284
02:19:24,060 --> 02:19:28,010
I write a lot and I write screenplays 
that'll never get made,

3285
02:19:28,011 --> 02:19:29,870
but I just ride them to get up out of 
me,

3286
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:30,440
you know?

3287
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:32,030
And that's,
and that's what,

3288
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:32,983
that's what it's about really.
It's about whatever it is that you're 

3289
02:19:35,901 --> 02:19:38,420
compelled to do that you can do that 
you're talented at,

3290
02:19:38,421 --> 02:19:41,360
and then pursuing that and just fuck all
the rest of it,

3291
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:42,373
you know?
And I see it immediately here with say 

3292
02:19:44,031 --> 02:19:45,260
this,
and they think that,

3293
02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:46,490
well,
it's easy for you guys.

3294
02:19:46,491 --> 02:19:46,960
You know,
you,

3295
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:48,830
you had this other career and all this 
stuff.

3296
02:19:48,831 --> 02:19:49,521
It's like,
no,

3297
02:19:49,521 --> 02:19:50,780
not really.
I mean,

3298
02:19:50,781 --> 02:19:51,614
I come with baggage.
Do you think the first movie I sent the 

3299
02:19:53,361 --> 02:19:56,150
Sundance people didn't go?
You know what I mean?

3300
02:19:56,350 --> 02:19:56,900
Right,
right.

3301
02:19:56,900 --> 02:19:59,570
Hey Zed from police academy,
we made a movie,

3302
02:19:59,571 --> 02:20:00,920
let's watch this.
You know what I mean?

3303
02:20:00,921 --> 02:20:02,750
So,
so sure.

3304
02:20:02,751 --> 02:20:04,760
We have a lot of of foot,
you know,

3305
02:20:04,761 --> 02:20:07,880
we have a lot of things are easier on 
some ways,

3306
02:20:07,881 --> 02:20:09,440
but then there's baggage.
Yeah,

3307
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:10,663
well that's just,
I guess that's with anybody that's been 

3308
02:20:12,231 --> 02:20:14,120
in the public eye for a long period of 
time,

3309
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:16,490
especially again,
a guy like you,

3310
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:18,680
that's a nuance guy.

3311
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:20,420
There's a lot going on.
There's,

3312
02:20:20,421 --> 02:20:21,254
there's uh,
there's the happy stuff and there's 

3313
02:20:22,791 --> 02:20:23,624
anger and there's silly shit and there's
mockery and then there's like really 

3314
02:20:26,571 --> 02:20:28,670
important points that you want to make,
you know?

3315
02:20:28,671 --> 02:20:32,900
And then there's mistakes and there's 
impulses and we've all met those.

3316
02:20:32,901 --> 02:20:33,800
Yeah.
But that's,

3317
02:20:33,890 --> 02:20:35,480
that's the best part.
Yeah.

3318
02:20:35,540 --> 02:20:38,670
I don't know.
If I was on a set and,

3319
02:20:38,690 --> 02:20:39,523
and,
and I felt people weren't having an 

3320
02:20:41,811 --> 02:20:43,240
enjoyable time,
it would,

3321
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:45,670
not that it needs to be a party,
but if you know,

3322
02:20:45,770 --> 02:20:48,200
people felt compromised,
it would really bother me.

3323
02:20:48,410 --> 02:20:48,981
Oh,
for sure.

3324
02:20:48,981 --> 02:20:49,814
Look if you were having an actor to a 
part that they just really didn't 

3325
02:20:51,891 --> 02:20:54,920
believe in and thought the piece was 
paying off the process.

3326
02:20:54,921 --> 02:20:56,990
Got It.
Was was unpleasant.

3327
02:20:57,020 --> 02:20:58,160
You know,
I mean,

3328
02:20:58,161 --> 02:21:01,070
my sets are usually pretty ridiculous,
you know,

3329
02:21:01,071 --> 02:21:02,960
I'm the one that's probably 
internalizing,

3330
02:21:02,961 --> 02:21:04,730
but it's very,
you know,

3331
02:21:04,731 --> 02:21:05,900
I can't explain it.
Like,

3332
02:21:05,901 --> 02:21:08,210
um,
like when I was on Kimmel,

3333
02:21:08,211 --> 02:21:09,720
you know,
I remember once I,

3334
02:21:09,770 --> 02:21:12,880
I spent $8,000 and I bought

3335
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:15,733
10 tons of snow and put it in the 
parking lot for Christmas and Jimmy 

3336
02:21:20,301 --> 02:21:21,260
looks at the window,
it goes,

3337
02:21:21,261 --> 02:21:23,860
what does that,
what does that Disney have a,

3338
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:26,240
no,
I bought snow for everybody.

3339
02:21:26,570 --> 02:21:29,030
It's like go play and stole my God.
We made,

3340
02:21:29,070 --> 02:21:30,440
we made,
we went sledding,

3341
02:21:30,441 --> 02:21:32,930
we made ramps.
We had the hugest snowball fight.

3342
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:34,460
You know,
life's short.

3343
02:21:34,910 --> 02:21:36,980
I remember once everybody wanted to kill
each other,

3344
02:21:36,981 --> 02:21:41,670
so I rented one of those giant balloon 
bounces and you know,

3345
02:21:41,750 --> 02:21:44,480
everybody just bounced around and it was
nobody,

3346
02:21:44,481 --> 02:21:46,610
there was no pressure on the set 
anymore.

3347
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:48,913
Do you,
did you like doing that show or was it 

3348
02:21:50,751 --> 02:21:52,100
just really,
I really,

3349
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:57,160
I really liked it a lot and then,
then I actually loved it and then when I

3350
02:21:57,951 --> 02:22:00,470
started to realize I was,

3351
02:22:01,130 --> 02:22:01,963
uh,

3352
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:04,173
honestly,
I'll be really honest right now when I 

3353
02:22:05,321 --> 02:22:07,150
started to feel like I was starting to 
phone it in,

3354
02:22:07,151 --> 02:22:07,984
I was like going,
this is not fair to my friend Brian who 

3355
02:22:11,261 --> 02:22:12,550
I love.
I love him.

3356
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:16,510
Oh,
we do a lot of directions,

3357
02:22:16,511 --> 02:22:17,310
right?
You did.

3358
02:22:17,310 --> 02:22:18,010
Well,
I ran into,

3359
02:22:18,010 --> 02:22:19,470
in New York when you were doing the 
Chappelle show,

3360
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:22,840
worked on Chappelle the very first 
episode.

3361
02:22:22,870 --> 02:22:23,261
It,
well,

3362
02:22:23,261 --> 02:22:25,240
I would work at the beginning.
Uh,

3363
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:26,343
Dave Chappelle's not crazy.
That's the other thing that drives me 

3364
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:29,080
nuts,
you know,

3365
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:29,913
cause he walked away,
but I saw those people micromanage him 

3366
02:22:32,341 --> 02:22:34,560
and drive him nuts.
They were so rude.

3367
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:35,730
Not,
there's not crazy.

3368
02:22:35,731 --> 02:22:37,230
He's a friend of mine.
I love Dave.

3369
02:22:37,260 --> 02:22:38,820
He's a very,
very brilliant guy.

3370
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:40,260
Yeah.
I very smart and aware.

3371
02:22:40,261 --> 02:22:43,140
And how's the Kahunas to do what you 
said,

3372
02:22:43,141 --> 02:22:45,780
to quit,
to walk away from 50 million bucks.

3373
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:48,760
I'm uncomfortable saying this story,
but I don't know,

3374
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:51,510
he's just trying to use,
cause I,

3375
02:22:51,610 --> 02:22:55,920
I know the semantics of the language,
I'll just say what happened.

3376
02:22:56,110 --> 02:22:58,350
People can make whatever.
But I was,

3377
02:22:58,770 --> 02:22:59,603
I was directing the show and white 
comedy central executives came down and 

3378
02:23:02,701 --> 02:23:04,140
asked me,
they said,

3379
02:23:04,141 --> 02:23:06,930
can you tell Dave not the same nigger so
much?

3380
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:09,450
And I said,
Dave,

3381
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:10,493
the white comedy central executives in 
front of him so much that goes Bobcat 

3382
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:20,940
Push Pasha,
what did you say?

3383
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:25,920
It was really weird and awkward and then
they left.

3384
02:23:25,921 --> 02:23:28,650
Like I intentionally thought,
well this will be embarrassing for them.

3385
02:23:28,710 --> 02:23:30,750
This is exactly what you told me.
Oh good.

3386
02:23:30,810 --> 02:23:31,643
Cause cause yeah,
I don't think I've ever come forward 

3387
02:23:33,451 --> 02:23:34,201
that story,
but yeah,

3388
02:23:34,201 --> 02:23:36,900
I'm the,
I'm witness to that insanity.

3389
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:39,620
As the show became more and more 
successful,

3390
02:23:39,621 --> 02:23:40,454
apparently what had happened was 
advertisers were skittish about being 

3391
02:23:43,401 --> 02:23:44,630
involved,
even though,

3392
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:47,540
even though it's gangbusters ratings,
they still were like,

3393
02:23:47,541 --> 02:23:48,374
he's keeps saying the n word.
Toyota doesn't really want to be 

3394
02:23:52,971 --> 02:23:55,340
involved with the n word.
We don't know what to do.

3395
02:23:55,830 --> 02:23:56,663
Um,
so,

3396
02:23:56,810 --> 02:23:57,561
um,
you know,

3397
02:23:57,561 --> 02:23:59,780
they took,
in my opinion,

3398
02:23:59,781 --> 02:24:02,420
the greatest sketch comedy show of all 
time.

3399
02:24:02,450 --> 02:24:04,080
I don't think there's anything that 
comes close.

3400
02:24:04,081 --> 02:24:07,130
So I think it was two years.
So one of my greatest accomplishments as

3401
02:24:07,131 --> 02:24:07,964
an actor,
cause I don't really like much what I 

3402
02:24:09,861 --> 02:24:10,694
did except for news radio,
but one of the greatest accomplishments 

3403
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:13,753
mean he's like,
I feel like I was on the greatest show 

3404
02:24:14,541 --> 02:24:15,374
of all time.
I did a couple sketches on the greatest 

3405
02:24:16,461 --> 02:24:17,294
show of all time.
I really think that show was the all 

3406
02:24:19,401 --> 02:24:20,234
time most innovative and hilarious 
sketch comedy show ever from the haters 

3407
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:25,790
ball.

3408
02:24:25,790 --> 02:24:30,790
Like the haters convention to the Black 
Blind.

3409
02:24:31,310 --> 02:24:36,150
A waste of white supremacist too.
I mean you could go down the list of the

3410
02:24:36,151 --> 02:24:39,170
Rick James and draft the racial draft.
Yeah.

3411
02:24:39,171 --> 02:24:41,990
I mean he had so many killer,
killer,

3412
02:24:41,991 --> 02:24:43,220
killer bits.
There were just,

3413
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:45,200
it was so original.
He's brilliant.

3414
02:24:45,410 --> 02:24:47,930
Well that's one of the most offensive 
things about what's going on now.

3415
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:49,033
Like there's so much rehashed and 
regenerated and just did this take like 

3416
02:24:53,841 --> 02:24:54,674
a script,
a take a sketch from mad TV and they 

3417
02:24:57,081 --> 02:25:01,880
sorta rework it and spit it out today on
some new show and it's fucking gross.

3418
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:03,410
I mean,
that's what you're seeing.

3419
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:06,350
I mean,
what Amy Schumer's getting accused of,

3420
02:25:06,380 --> 02:25:07,213
you know,
what you're seeing over and over again 

3421
02:25:07,731 --> 02:25:08,564
and they keep showing these sketches.
Well here was a sketch that was on mad 

3422
02:25:10,401 --> 02:25:11,900
TV.
Here's a sketchup was on this,

3423
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:15,260
here was the sketches that he never saw 
that with Chappelle was Chapelle.

3424
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:17,990
All those sketches were unique and 
unusual.

3425
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:20,740
Yeah.
And it was also kind of a,

3426
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:25,480
the funny thing was also in the editing 
process,

3427
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:28,760
uh,
following the ball,

3428
02:25:28,761 --> 02:25:29,870
like,
like

3429
02:25:29,990 --> 02:25:34,500
we would discover stuff that was just 
funny in the in,

3430
02:25:34,570 --> 02:25:35,780
you know,
I can't explain it.

3431
02:25:36,530 --> 02:25:37,363
It's like we're cutting this a 
Mitsubishi commercial and the woman 

3432
02:25:41,010 --> 02:25:41,843
there,
her breasts came out during the filming 

3433
02:25:44,391 --> 02:25:45,224
and not in this part of this grip.
I could dave just see that and you just 

3434
02:25:49,581 --> 02:25:54,581
see Dave's eyes go right.
Then he busted himself on the,

3435
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:57,620
during the ramp around,
showed what he done.

3436
02:25:57,650 --> 02:26:00,350
That's a little bit beautiful.
It was beautiful because he was busted.

3437
02:26:00,351 --> 02:26:01,310
And so,
yeah,

3438
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:02,173
I,
uh,

3439
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:04,640
yeah,
it was really weird for him to be,

3440
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:07,550
it just drives me nuts when people act 
like he's crazy.

3441
02:26:07,551 --> 02:26:12,500
Cause I think he's super sane in a 
brilliant and really nice or whatever.

3442
02:26:12,501 --> 02:26:14,930
A black guy goes to Africa and you go,
oh,

3443
02:26:15,020 --> 02:26:16,490
he's fucking lost it.
Right,

3444
02:26:16,590 --> 02:26:17,423
right.
What does he do when he went to Africa 

3445
02:26:18,501 --> 02:26:19,550
to try to find peace?

3446
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:20,383
Jesus Christ,
they offered them 50 million bucks and 

3447
02:26:22,521 --> 02:26:23,354
he went to Africa.
He lost his mind and lost his fucking 

3448
02:26:24,831 --> 02:26:25,570
month.
Yeah.

3449
02:26:25,570 --> 02:26:26,930
That's,
that's the thing that,

3450
02:26:26,931 --> 02:26:28,490
uh,
that people,

3451
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:29,871
yeah,
when you,

3452
02:26:29,871 --> 02:26:30,890
when you,
again,

3453
02:26:30,891 --> 02:26:31,760
when I was saying,
you know,

3454
02:26:31,761 --> 02:26:33,920
fulfillment versus,
you know,

3455
02:26:33,921 --> 02:26:37,430
this idea of just having a 24 hour 
orgasm and,

3456
02:26:37,550 --> 02:26:38,930
you know,
it's,

3457
02:26:39,350 --> 02:26:40,560
it's ridiculous.
Wait,

3458
02:26:40,610 --> 02:26:45,610
we don't pursue being fulfilled,
which is the whole jam.

3459
02:26:45,710 --> 02:26:46,610
Right?
Well,

3460
02:26:46,611 --> 02:26:47,444
it's a tricky little dance because,
cause we have to pay bills and we have 

3461
02:26:50,151 --> 02:26:53,060
to raise their kids and we have to be 
responsible.

3462
02:26:53,061 --> 02:26:53,871
But,
but,

3463
02:26:53,871 --> 02:26:54,800
uh,
you know this,

3464
02:26:54,830 --> 02:26:57,440
every time you take that leap,
every time you go,

3465
02:26:57,441 --> 02:26:58,900
well,
this is really scary way.

3466
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:02,750
Every time it pays off.
I've never taken the leap.

3467
02:27:03,230 --> 02:27:06,830
I've taken leaps why I did what I 
thought people wanted or I thought might

3468
02:27:06,831 --> 02:27:09,890
work or might be successful.
That always works terribly.

3469
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:12,560
But I've just said,
I've got to tell this story because this

3470
02:27:12,561 --> 02:27:16,190
is the story that I'm interested right 
now that's always paid off.

3471
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:17,620
How's it paid off?
Is it,

3472
02:27:17,621 --> 02:27:19,250
I might do my rich and my this and that.
No,

3473
02:27:19,251 --> 02:27:20,320
but you know,
unfulfilled.

3474
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:24,200
So I sit there and I connect with a 
small group of people in that.

3475
02:27:24,201 --> 02:27:25,940
That's pretty amazing.
Beautiful.

3476
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:27,073
That's it.
The end can either buddy bobcat call 

3477
02:27:29,171 --> 02:27:29,930
with lettuce,
gentlemen,

3478
02:27:29,930 --> 02:27:31,130
give it up.
Give it up.

3479
02:27:33,630 --> 02:27:34,650
Thanks brother.
Thank you.

3480
02:27:34,651 --> 02:27:35,480
There's a lot of fun,
man.

3481
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:36,690
Thank God we did it.
That was great.

3482
02:27:36,691 --> 02:27:41,691
And we ended with the headphones on.
We kept him on.

3483
02:27:44,310 --> 02:27:47,550
Is this thing still recording?
Gary Johnson tomorrow.

3484
02:27:47,551 --> 02:27:49,530
Presidential candidate Gary Johnson 9:00
AM.

3485
02:27:49,531 --> 02:27:50,364
See a fox.

3486
02:27:53,890 --> 02:27:54,723
Yeah.
