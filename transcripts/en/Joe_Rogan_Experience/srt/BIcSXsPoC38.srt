1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:02,820
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,121
You know,

4
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:03,681
homelands,

5
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:04,514
a good show.

6
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,763
No habit.

7
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,750
I gave up after loss on tea.

8
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,970
Just don't watch television.

9
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,250
I don't watch anything they show and
real three or a flat screen Elvis.

10
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,084
The TV,

11
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,663
I only watch.

12
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:17,761
That's it.

13
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm done throwing and watch.

14
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,431
It's not a good thing.

15
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,241
It's not any virtue.

16
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,500
Like I watched bigfoot hunter,

17
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,330
I watched fucking two episodes.

18
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:25,164
I had DVR

19
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,420
finding big foot or something and it's
like a series where they have like more

20
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:31,400
than one hour.

21
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,420
The first episode they'd be like,

22
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:33,571
yeah,

23
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:34,440
we're not going to find them.

24
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,071
Well,

25
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:35,890
it's awesome.

26
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,150
No,

27
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,370
the best part about it is
the beginning of the guys.

28
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,920
I've been hunting
Sasquatches for 25 years.

29
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,090
I'll quit now.

30
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,410
Quit quitting that.

31
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,400
You haven't even got a video
of one and crazy as hell.

32
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,220
It's like,

33
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,431
you know,

34
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:47,731
it's like,

35
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:47,941
hey,

36
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:50,220
you know how those go shows
are really not realistic.

37
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,110
Like they never really find a ghost.

38
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,810
This what if we did it with Sas,

39
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,840
but what's next?

40
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,400
Like Tuba cobre sure.

41
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,780
If they can sell it,

42
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,080
they would.

43
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,830
They would have it.

44
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,161
It's a,

45
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:00,360
it's a fun show to watch though,

46
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,380
because it's so stupid.

47
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,310
I mean,

48
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,821
first of all,

49
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,830
everyone has a video that
they want you to analyze.

50
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,940
It may have been a Sasquatch,

51
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,950
so they have to recreate
the scene in the video.

52
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:08,803
It looks sweet.

53
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,930
It looks so silly because the people knew
exactly where the car was and this is

54
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:13,531
the tree.

55
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,710
And so they line it up on the camera and
then they have this big guy named Bobo

56
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,060
who kind of looks like a big foot.

57
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,930
And he goes out there
and he does exactly what,

58
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,340
and he's always way bigger
than the big foot in the video.

59
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,310
So it always proves that
it wasn't really that day.

60
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,511
Oh,

61
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:28,071
I see here.

62
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:28,980
Or You were big foot.

63
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,311
Yep.

64
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:30,870
Out of pig foot a season one.

65
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,351
Season two.

66
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,041
They replaced me.

67
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:32,970
There was like a contract.

68
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,720
Do you remember when I wanted to
make us more empathetic and uh,

69
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,650
Harry and the Hendersons like a
whole family lived with big foot.

70
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,191
You know,

71
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:43,024
why not?

72
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,650
She badgered her selfie to my kids.

73
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm pretty sure.

74
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,630
I don't even trust dogs than,

75
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:52,111
I don't know.

76
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,900
This guy's got a fucking big
foot hanging out with his kids.

77
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,880
He probably told these stupid
humans a thing or two about love.

78
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,380
I

79
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,940
hurry in the Henderson,

80
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,590
there's never been a
real good bigfoot movie.

81
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:08,424
How about that?

82
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,880
Nobody has ever stepped
up and it's not like,

83
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,813
uh,

84
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,830
the bar's been set that high.

85
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,820
The bar is incredibly low.

86
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,890
The bar is all fraudulent videos.

87
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,130
Yeah.

88
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,940
That's the closest thing to a big foot
move and I would think after like season

89
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,360
one,

90
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,400
there's a lot of people that
watch the show and they're like,

91
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:27,140
why not?

92
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,280
Like I think you should

93
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,643
never been up.

94
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,310
There's,

95
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,380
I mean there was like
this is a really bad ones.

96
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,810
The seventies or some swamp thing,

97
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:37,770
monster guy.

98
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,620
But there's never been a movie,

99
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,170
a good movie about a bunch of
people that encounter big foot.

100
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,560
Why?

101
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,380
How is that possible that you have such a,

102
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,660
a folklore that is
completely permeated society.

103
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:49,080
He's not there.

104
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,000
No one's ever made,

105
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,881
not sexy,

106
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:54,020
but I made a movie about finding bigfoot.

107
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,840
That's amazing.

108
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,673
That's true.

109
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,430
That's incredible.

110
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,701
We're really,

111
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,550
when you think about how popular it is,

112
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,280
you would movie would be human.

113
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,750
The movie ideas they're doing,

114
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,340
they're just,

115
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,710
okay.

116
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,570
It's like based on a matchbook.

117
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:04,831
Yeah.

118
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:05,220
Like,

119
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,220
so you'd think they'd have
big fun romantic comedies
when you hear some romantic

120
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,770
comedy premise and you like what?

121
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:12,971
I don't understand.

122
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:15,370
Finally meet again at 60.

123
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:15,610
You know,

124
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,260
I sometimes feel like I just established
a consciousness when I was like 30

125
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,600
because like romantic comedies,

126
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,620
like I,

127
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:23,921
you know,

128
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,830
I was so dumb I think in
my twenties that like when,

129
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,321
you know,

130
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:27,910
it would be like,

131
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,743
uh,

132
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,830
uh,

133
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,400
you know,

134
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,500
Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal,

135
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:32,741
you know,

136
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:33,790
like Harry met Sally.

137
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,320
Like to me that was just a movie.

138
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,210
I didn't consider that a romantic comedy,

139
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:37,991
which it was,

140
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:42,370
but now it's like this genre
that is always existed,

141
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,480
but they just kind of like,

142
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:44,800
just churn out these,

143
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,950
just like those romantic code existed.

144
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,750
Movies were when a woman got mouthy,

145
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,160
the made gave her the back of her hand.

146
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,233
Yup.

147
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,313
Back of his hand.

148
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,453
Right.

149
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,720
That's what they used to do to the moon.

150
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:56,210
Alice.

151
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:56,650
Yeah.

152
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,483
All that stuff.

153
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,680
That was really good old days.

154
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,010
Billy Crystal fucked us.

155
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,510
Billy Crystal fucked up,

156
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,771
fucked us in.

157
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:03,604
Harry met Sally.

158
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,220
I tried to be tried to be manly.

159
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,900
He tried to like be the best.

160
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh,

161
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,220
I'd say a couple of,

162
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,290
and then he caved that are
sleepless nights because he,

163
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,450
so you'll see when Harry met Sally,

164
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,100
Harry met Sally is like,

165
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
it's like a sad ending to you.

166
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,681
You're like,

167
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,514
you know what?

168
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,770
It's weird.

169
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,101
You know,

170
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,480
you're the comedy policemen.

171
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,051
No,

172
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:26,860
I'm not.

173
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,020
She called me that before the Improv
and I told you that would be very

174
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:29,530
uncomfortable.

175
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,520
That makes you uncomfortable.

176
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,030
Not really,

177
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,863
but I only,

178
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,713
I looked,

179
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,580
I step in for one piece of civil unrest.

180
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,230
That's something I've
never done anything since.

181
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:38,711
Well,

182
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:43,711
there's something about that whole
situation with Leno and I don't know which

183
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:45,700
eye at all and uh,

184
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,990
but it's,

185
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:47,621
you know,

186
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,870
if there was a Joe Rogan
of that generation,

187
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,190
maybe to go and,

188
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,024
uh,

189
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,983
explain it,

190
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,710
that's why you,

191
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,700
that's our new show.

192
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
You look for bigfoot

193
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,450
comedy kind of a,

194
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,480
okay.
