1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,280
Okay,
it's on.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,360
I can't hear you.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,310
I can't hear me.
Hear me,

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,410
hear me now,
but it's not very loud.

5
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:18,610
We're using the wrong mic too.
I am sorry I won't use it.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,760
How's that one?
It's not any better.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,490
In fact it's lower.
Hello?

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,190
It's actually your headphones.
How am I?

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,830
How's mine?
Hello?

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,570
Hello?
It sounds great.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,140
Yeah.
Hello?

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,010
Hello?
Hello?

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,640
Hello.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,110
So should I add snowflakes right now?
Hello?

15
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:42,100
Hello?
Hello?

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,360
Hello?
Hello?

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,060
Hello?

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,320
There it is.
Yeah,

19
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,600
these headphones suck,
but if you turn it all the way up,

20
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,100
it's okay doc.
And can you talk?

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,840
Hello?
Hello?

22
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,100
Beautiful.
We're good.

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,310
How do I drop the volume online?
You start sucking his cock.

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,430
How do you suck?
It's pushed forward towards me.

25
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,030
Hello?
Hello?

26
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,200
Hello?
I thought that's better.

27
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:05,990
I guess still as wowed.
Don't be gay.

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,560
You know you're on right now.
Like 10 minutes ago you were just 

29
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,290
telling me when and I'm like,
all right,

30
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,330
ready dude,
you got to do a better job.

31
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:21,120
Not just preposterous.
Were all smoking.

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,130
We will know what the fuck is going on.
How dare you.

33
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:27,390
So when I say gay,
I spelled a g h e y no take backs.

34
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,340
Broken experience is brought.
We're about to have news,

35
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,670
new sponsors.
You've got some really cool lined up,

36
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,150
very excited in the video game world.
Very excited.

37
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,320
Yeah.
I can't tell you preview,

38
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:45,321
but uh,
another very cool sponsor and I'm super 

39
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:45,321
excited about it looks.
It's a,

40
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:46,890
you know,
one of the cool things about having this

41
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:50,160
podcast is you can kind of pick and 
choose who sponsors the show.

42
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,900
You know,
we've had some offers from stuff that we

43
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:55,170
really weren't Kinda into.
And so like how do we even do this?

44
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,660
This wouldn't even work.
It's not something we give a shit about.

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,960
But I'd like video games more than I 
want to like video games unfortunately.

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,240
Yeah.
We both have problems in my life.

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,480
So we're going to come.
We're going to help contribute to a lot 

48
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:11,580
of people's addiction soon.
Really cool.

49
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,850
A lot of it is ipad.
I can't tell you shit.

50
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,820
A lot of them are ipad based though.
It's really cool.

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,280
The IPAD.
The cool thing about the IPAD is it's a 

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,061
gyroscope or whatever the fuck you call 
it detects motion euros,

53
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,680
scope,
like it's like a sandwich and you,

54
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:33,681
um,
you can drive cars and do all kinds of 

55
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:34,680
things just by moving the pattern.
That's fucking incredible device.

56
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:38,660
Really seen those remote control planes 
that you can fly with this.

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,890
Yes,
I have quadra copters.

58
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,960
Our original sponsor though is the 
flashlight,

59
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,980
the first one,
the,

60
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,420
the one back when we were snowflakes in 
the back of a ustream page on,

61
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:50,250
uh,
on the laptop back in the day as a,

62
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,350
200 episodes ago by the way,
focusing.

63
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,570
That's like 600 hours of listening to 
you.

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,990
I don't have that much to say.
People say you repeat shit.

65
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:58,330
I'm like,
dude,

66
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,830
what the fuck do you think,
man?

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,130
Come

68
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
on dude.
It sounds like we're talking about the 

69
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,051
news.
And I were talking about some pretty 

70
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:08,521
preposterous share that I think about 
all the time and I repeat things to 

71
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,611
myself all the time.
I have a certain amount of memory and 

72
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:11,611
it's all taken up by the fleshlight 
ladies.

73
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:12,040
Gentlemen,
if you go to Joe Rogan.net

74
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,960
and click on a link for the flashlight,
entering the code name,

75
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:18,130
Rogan,
you will get 15 percent off a very solid

76
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,860
product.
A product that if I left you alone on an

77
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,350
island for a million years,
is all the tools in the world.

78
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,030
You would never be able to figure it 
out.

79
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,860
You'd never be able to figure out how to
make a flashlight.

80
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,850
Okay?
You wouldn't.

81
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,730
It'd be like at a salmon over the 
average person.

82
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,880
You would never even never figured it.
Yeah.

83
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,890
And then you get those little bones in 
your insured to wrap some bamboo like 

84
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,020
leaves around a salmon.

85
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,280
You know what?
You would never figured out.

86
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,300
Also,
vitamins,

87
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:44,530
you would never figure out Alpha brain.
You would never figure out new mood.

88
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,560
He would never figure it out.
True Tech Sport or shroom,

89
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,280
tech,
immune.

90
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,050
All of these are what we call nootropics
except for a shroom tech that's a little

91
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,810
bit of a nootropic,
but also more of a something that,

92
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,290
uh,
is,

93
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,100
uh,
aids,

94
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,100
your immune system and your,
um,

95
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,290
your athletic performance.
There's all the explanations for all 

96
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,260
these various products.
It's available on [inaudible] dot com.

97
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,530
That's o n n I t checkout Alpha brain.
That is the cognitive enhancing 

98
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,361
supplement.
New Mood is the five htp and l trip 

99
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:15,680
defend supplement.
Um,

100
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,890
both of those things are great for 
boosting your,

101
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,050
your own body's production of Serotonin,
which actually puts you in a better 

102
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,050
mood.
Believe it or not,

103
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,360
a lot of the way you feel is fucking 
chemical.

104
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,750
And of course a lot of it is that people
are depressed because their livestocks 

105
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:30,750
let's be.
A lot of us are wage slaves.

106
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,840
Let's be honest.
That's not good.

107
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:34,870
And I don't think taking pills while 
that's going on,

108
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,420
just to try to trick yourself into 
thinking that everything's groovy.

109
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:39,160
I'm not a really big believer in that 
either.

110
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:41,830
I'm much more of a proponent of,
you know,

111
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,220
get your fucking life in order and you'd
be amazed at how much better you feel.

112
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,820
But then again,
I've never had a problem with the 

113
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:50,820
balance of my mind and I know people 
have.

114
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,480
So I don't,
I don't ever say that you shouldn't take

115
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:55,420
this or you should take that.
Everybody's fucking completely different

116
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,670
and it's preposterous to think that you 
know,

117
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,940
the inner workings of another man's mind
that said,

118
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,880
go to [inaudible] dot com.
Check out all the shit we have for sale.

119
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,730
Everything is stuff that I have taken,
I believe in.

120
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:10,030
I take on a regular basis.
It's a normal part of my diet.

121
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,200
I also eat very healthy.
I think you should too.

122
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,740
I eat like a fucking savage sometimes,
you know,

123
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,750
but I earned that for the most part.
I drink Kale shakes every morning with 

124
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,100
fresh garlic and ginger and salary.
Like the more you take good things into 

125
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:31,291
your body,
the more you can justify those krispy 

126
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:31,291
Kreme donuts.
I'm like,

127
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,230
fuck it,
I'm just going off right now.

128
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,640
And you always feel like shit 
afterwards.

129
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:37,360
But I think rewards like that,
even your body can process that.

130
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,100
If you do it on occasion.
You know,

131
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,220
if you do it once a week,
once a week day where you just eat ice 

132
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,220
cream,
like a fucking slob.

133
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,410
So nothing wrong with that.
As long as the rest of the week,

134
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:50,050
generally speaking,
treat your body like you fucking love it

135
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,170
and it's precious because it is bitches 
on a.com.

136
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,170
All of our products,
especially the first time orders of 30 

137
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:58,170
pills,
if you order 'em all any,

138
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:58,940
anything,
the first order,

139
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,800
you get 100 percent of your money back 
guarantee.

140
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,380
If you don't like it,
and that doesn't mean 100 percent.

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,410
If you return the product,
it means 100 percent.

142
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:08,870
Even if you eat it all and you go,
you know what?

143
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:09,980
This isn't what I thought I was going to
be.

144
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,020
What is it going to be?
It's going to make your.

145
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
Your brain feels sharper.
That's what Alpha brain does.

146
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not magic.
It's not nothing new.

147
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,240
What does that movie was that Ashley?
What's his name?

148
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,610
Cooper.
Our limitless.

149
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,650
It's.
It's not.

150
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,670
It's not gonna.
Turn them more on into a brilliant 

151
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,831
person,
but it will affect the way your brain 

152
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:29,831
moves.
I like it makes me feel better.

153
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:31,910
It makes my brain work better.
Go to Joe Rogan.net.

154
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,940
Click on the link for Alpha brain and 
use the code named Rogan and you will 

155
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,270
get 10 percent any and all orders,
not just your first one.

156
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,980
Ra pitches.
It is podcast number 200.

157
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,840
What a fucking trip

158
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Dunkin.
There's some Russell and trying to find 

159
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,890
my alpha.
If you're on a desert island,

160
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:06,891
you would make Alpha brain adult mermaid
mermaid dried scrapings from the inside 

161
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:12,800
of them were always pushing marriage,
but they say the method,

162
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,370
the mermaid came from horny sailor is 
trying to rationalize fucking seals.

163
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,440
Course fucking everything.
Manatees.

164
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,430
Manatees,
yeah.

165
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:23,520
They'd fuck a manatee because there are 
so horny and they then they'd be like,

166
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:24,450
no,
it was a mermaid.

167
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,900
I swear.
It's kind of a crazy asshole.

168
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,940
Would commit back then getting into the 
goddamn boat and going across the ocean 

169
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,310
for like four months.
A lot of times,

170
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:37,311
not even knowing if there was some shit 
on the other end thinking it might just 

171
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,520
stop like they thought the world just 
ended and there a waterfall.

172
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,960
That's how bad Europe sucked in the 14 
hundreds that Columbus was like,

173
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,370
yeah,
maybe it does fall off.

174
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,040
Let's go.
Pitches come on forever.

175
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,990
Look what the fuck we're eating at the 
streets.

176
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,910
We're living in.
People stink.

177
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,990
Yeah,
yeah,

178
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,990
yeah.
That's the.

179
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,230
They were so upset with Europe.
They were like,

180
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:58,900
fuck this.
We're just going to get in a boat and go

181
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,130
to someplace.
I mean,

182
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,290
we're not even looking at it really,
truly and perspective because here's 

183
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,100
something that was really,
really rare back then.

184
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,260
Any one on one accounts of someone who 
went there that liked it.

185
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,110
Forget about picture.
They didn't have pictures back then.

186
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,200
Would you see some drawings?
No,

187
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,240
you didn't even talk to one guy probably
that went over there himself and had a 

188
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,560
wonderful and prosperous life and was 
telling me,

189
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,590
listen,
there's land to be had.

190
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,150
It's a great time.
Come on.

191
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:33,151
Over.
What a great mass of movement of humans 

192
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,080
in such a short period of time.

193
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,860
The population or the population of the 
North American continent,

194
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,120
you know,
the fact that there was already a small 

195
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,951
group of nomadic people that were living
here and they were just completely 

196
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:48,100
overwhelmed by the volume and the 
numbers.

197
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,580
I think there are a lot of them in,
in North America.

198
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:55,320
I think there was a lot of native 
Americans and indigenous people.

199
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,870
When you say a lot,
was there like millions?

200
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,710
Like.
No,

201
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,580
no.
Let me say,

202
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,610
let me say even if there was a lot,
it's nothing in comparison to what it 

203
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:04,610
is.
Like right now like this,

204
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,870
there's never been population numbers 
like this anywhere,

205
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:07,960
right?
Where the,

206
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:08,780
uh,
what is that?

207
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Has there ever been a place where there 
was virtually no one and an immigrants 

208
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,570
all came in and then within a few 
hundred years there's $300 million over?

209
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,850
Nope.
No.

210
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:18,700
Right.
I mean we,

211
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,750
unless it was pre flood before the last 
media or impact or something like that,

212
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,390
I wonder how many native Americans or 
were before they were killed and 

213
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:29,390
pushback back.

214
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,070
And you know what,
that must have been unbelievable for 

215
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,741
them.
The people that have lived their lives 

216
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:36,741
like a certain way before the first 
white men came.

217
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:41,640
You know,
it must have been mostly been 

218
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:41,640
preposterous.
Like you know,

219
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,630
they probably generation after 
generation,

220
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,330
they had followed the buffalo and they 
had lived this,

221
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,400
you know,
very disciplined in spiritual and sort 

222
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,271
of in tune with nature and their 
environment and they had very clear laws

223
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:57,240
of morality and how you deal with nature
and how you use up your resources.

224
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,600
Really fascinating.
Like you could tell that they had a deep

225
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:05,601
reverence and a real understanding for 
the resources of the environment and not

226
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:10,671
taking too much,
not wasting anything because you might 

227
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:10,671
not have it man.
Like they,

228
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:15,450
they were under a real concern about 
starving to death if they didn't get up 

229
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,300
in the morning and follow the buffalo 
and they lost those motherfuckers.

230
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,960
If they have no food for a few weeks,
like what people use,

231
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,490
your baby can die.
Man.

232
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:26,320
You might just fuck up and run into a,
you know,

233
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,430
time to seasons wrong and run into 
someplace where you're stuck chasing 

234
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,460
these buffalo in a place that gets 
snowed in and there's no food.

235
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,060
Oh yeah.
Not to mention the fact that bears are 

236
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,840
eating you a bear.
That's a real worry for you.

237
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,930
Yeah.
Especially if you're in the woods and 

238
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,360
you fuck up and stumble upon its mother.
A mother and the cubs are getting there.

239
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,360
They're fucking monsters.
I mean,

240
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,300
think about how aggressive people are 
around their babies.

241
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:56,301
You know,
you're dealing with a giant thousand 

242
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:57,780
pound fucking dog essentially.
So they go,

243
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,350
I mean dogs a dog with thick skin.
Those things as such.

244
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,960
They did a scan.
They bite themselves.

245
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:08,961
They don't even hurt themselves.
Never seen them go to war with each 

246
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:08,961
other.

247
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:12,960
Yeah,
they're taking chunks of hairs are 

248
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:12,960
flying and shit like that and they're 
fine.

249
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,530
They're fine.
Just get the fuck out of each other.

250
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,780
Being each other's Claude,
each other's crap.

251
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,960
They literally would have dismembered,
are weak and gelatinous like bodies was 

252
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,540
just torn them apart like they're 
nothing just crunched through your 

253
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,141
skull.
What a shit life it must have been back 

254
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:33,531
then.
I mean the American Indians on one hand 

255
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:37,191
you can say there was a lot of 
satisfaction in that life and they 

256
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:39,690
probably were happier than the majority 
of people today.

257
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,900
I think that's really arguable,
but that's just the majority of people 

258
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,991
there for weak ass bitches.
It's not that today isn't way more 

259
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:49,200
awesome and people get confused in that.
Sometimes people go,

260
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:54,201
you know what?
People were happier back when they 

261
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:54,201
couldn't read.
Did you know that people are happier?

262
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:54,220
People

263
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,220
have your back when they just had grunts
and everybody knew what they had to do 

264
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,440
to keep saying that doesn't mean back 
then doesn't suck,

265
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:04,441
and today's an awesome.
It just means that today is so uber 

266
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:06,070
complex that a lot of people just don't 
even try.

267
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,090
They just go and do it and they just 
throw it down on the ground and they run

268
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:14,410
away because there's no mechanism to 
really take care of that back then.

269
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:19,411
If you throw yourself on the ground,
I'm not doing this so fucking barrack 

270
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:22,390
eats you a bobcat would you?
You have to kill you.

271
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:27,391
You'd starve to death.
Now you can really get a lot of like 

272
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:27,500
weird,
like weepy.

273
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,580
You can be really weepy and scared with 
very little effect,

274
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,890
but the effect is,
like you say,

275
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,400
you still get an effect.
I mean,

276
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,470
the effect is for sure you never 
progressed,

277
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,790
but you don't have to worry about 
getting eaten outside your house.

278
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,040
You're not going to get eaten.
Yeah.

279
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:41,860
This,
the,

280
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,400
the,
the reason why people develop character,

281
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:50,401
the reason why people develop 
consequences because there are 

282
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:50,401
consequences for not having those 
things.

283
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,910
There's consequences for not having 
character.

284
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:56,911
This confident.
There's consequences for not having 

285
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:59,161
confidence,
for not having control over your 

286
00:12:59,161 --> 00:12:59,161
environment,
for not being a fucking man.

287
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,730
There are consequences,
but what are they really?

288
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:03,150
They're pretty meager.
Some other guy fucks your girlfriend.

289
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,530
She leaves you for someone who's more 
powerful.

290
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:10,531
You lose your,
your metal box and you have to get an 

291
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:10,531
older metal box that someone has already
lived in.

292
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,980
You know what?
What is it?

293
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,770
They take your car away.
You get a new car,

294
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,000
you have to move to a shitty apartment.
What?

295
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,410
What,
what?

296
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,420
What does it really happened?
Cumulative effect of everything that 

297
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,130
you're saying means that you're living 
in hell when you're a bitch is what?

298
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,240
It's pointing out the garbage.
But my point is,

299
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,150
even with the shittier new car,
you know,

300
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,980
the,
the less cool car,

301
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:34,981
the older car in this shitty apartment,
you're still living a billion times 

302
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,460
lever better than anybody did when they 
were,

303
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,520
you know,
Lewis and Clark would hitchhike in their

304
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:43,630
way across the fucking country,
walking no horses and shit.

305
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,070
They didn't know what the fuck was going
on.

306
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:47,530
That was a ridiculous thing to do.
You're living pretty,

307
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,920
pretty much everyone is living a life 
that's very similar to like Roman 

308
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,120
mobility.
You've got running water.

309
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,090
You can just go and turn the water on,
take a hot shower,

310
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,520
heats it up.
That's a brand new thing.

311
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:03,280
You've got a microwave,
you can cook your food and two minutes.

312
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,290
Have you seen those new?
Or there's new water heaters where it's 

313
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:08,350
a constant flow of hot water.

314
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,330
It heats it instantly and you don't have
to have like giant tanks of water.

315
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,850
The water goes through it and instantly 
heats it up.

316
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:17,750
So you could take a shower for an hour 
and a half and it,

317
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,350
you'll never run out of hot water.
Yeah.

318
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,150
So you,
you're living in paradise here.

319
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,300
You're not living back in the day when 
you wanted to kill fleas on your 

320
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,770
clothes,
you would put it over the toilet.

321
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,250
Did you know about that?
And the castles and the castles.

322
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,360
If you got the.
So everything was flea infested back 

323
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,360
then.
Everything was fleeing fast that there's

324
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,050
fleas fucking everywhere because no,
no way to clean,

325
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,110
no way to know poison for this Lisa.
Everything swarming with fleas until 

326
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,620
your clothes will get filled with fleas 
and to get rid of the fleas and a 

327
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,201
castle,
they would put the clothes over the 

328
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:53,201
shaft

329
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:57,340
where the sewer sewer is because the 
ammonia would rise up through the 

330
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
clothes and kill the fleas and the 
clothes.

331
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,620
Oh my God.
That's the world you're living in.

332
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,860
You're washing your clothes and shit 
fumes.

333
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,360
So they had to take those clothes and 
they had to all walk around smelling 

334
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,090
fumes,
but that's better than the fleas,

335
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:12,500
man.
That's better than the fleas.

336
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:15,350
I'd rather smell like old first one to 
figure that out.

337
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,090
It's like it's gotTa.
Be a way to get these fucking.

338
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,070
Let's try light myself on fire.
No,

339
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,440
that doesn't work.
That just kills me.

340
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,470
Let's try running through the frozen 
river.

341
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:27,090
Nope.
No Hypothermia.

342
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:28,200
Shit.
Fuck.

343
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,170
What about shit?
Shit.

344
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,440
Nobody likes shit.
I run away from Shit.

345
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,390
Let's see who's.
Let's play chicken with Shit.

346
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,730
Smell.
See who quits first.

347
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:36,220
Who for

348
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,810
human being?
You could get burned at the stake if you

349
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:43,811
took a shower more than twice a year.
Like if you were taking like three or 

350
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,170
four showers a year,
people might get suspicious.

351
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:46,550
Like you should take a lot of shower.

352
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,690
Will they also be like,
why is so clean?

353
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,160
Why do you smell that?
Which only witches smell good.

354
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,310
Yeah.
When you like take a warm shower and 

355
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,730
then you climb into some like really 
soft cotton clothes and you were like,

356
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:02,660
you are feeling better than most humans 
have ever felt in my whole life.

357
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,690
That's like a deeper sense of pleasure.
You plop down on your soft and 

358
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,260
comfortable bed and for,
you know,

359
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,340
look for a real reason.
You're not scared of getting eaten by 

360
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:14,340
anything.
Nope.

361
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,240
You're not scared of monsters or tribes 
coming into town and rating your village

362
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,810
and.
Yeah.

363
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,640
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

364
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:27,641
You're just chilling.
Maybe sometimes you get colds and then 

365
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:29,270
you know you get a z pack.
Hate your fucking fine.

366
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,520
You know,
you sitting in front of a television 

367
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:34,720
with the avatar playing say,
and you're,

368
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:38,030
you're sitting propped up on your 
pillows and your wearing clean clothes.

369
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,180
You have it better than anyone who's 
ever lived ever by a long shot.

370
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,580
Did you imagine Lewis and Clark,
if you could show those motherfuckers 

371
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,001
the average 23 year old dude lives in 
some shitty apartment is propped up on 

372
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:53,160
his bed watching TV in his bedroom,
eyes,

373
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,180
roommates,
fucking loud and the other room with a 

374
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,180
blender like that guy's living in 
paradise.

375
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,990
He's like displays,
place.

376
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,640
Show us onto the mouths.
You saw one mouse.

377
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,570
That's it.
Well,

378
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:07,571
there's not everywhere.
Infesting all your clothes and eating 

379
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:08,960
your food and giving everyone horrible 
diseases.

380
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,030
That's killing everyone.
Old.

381
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,360
Everyone with a weak immune system is 
just fucking dead.

382
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,480
There's nowhere to put the body.
So they stack them in the streets than 

383
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,361
the rats get infested with it and then 
the rat starts spreading it all over 

384
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:22,580
town.
And then you have the black plague.

385
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,140
Yeah.
Oh,

386
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,140
you saw a mouse

387
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,010
who poor little booby won't be okay with
sharing the world with a mouse.

388
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,980
Don't.
And also don't forget the fact that like

389
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,990
if you were pregnant,
there's a pretty good chance you're 

390
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,811
going to die.
Most likely you're going to die when 

391
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:40,781
that thing comes out of your pussy,
like you're just going to split you in 

392
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,440
half and there's no antibiotics in.
The baby's probably going to die too.

393
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,750
During Rome,
the infant mortality rate was 50 

394
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,750
percent.
Fifty percent,

395
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,340
half the babies died and you know,
that's one of the things we.

396
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:53,160
You read about like crazy stories of the
Bible.

397
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:57,120
We've talked about this before about how
so everything was so violent,

398
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,560
so crazy,
and people say,

399
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,740
well,
this is really a book of God,

400
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,750
the Book of religion.
Why would it have such gratuitous 

401
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,750
violence?
Why would violence be condoned?

402
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,510
Oh,
you don't even.

403
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,840
I don't even think we could wrap our 
hands around how hard life was back when

404
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:14,130
they wrote the Bible.
I mean,

405
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,410
and the,
even the New Testament,

406
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,670
even with Constantine and the bishops,
when they reworked the New Testament,

407
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,550
that's still,
you know,

408
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,450
that's still ridiculously hard.
It's a terrible life back then,

409
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,420
you know,
and,

410
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,470
and you,
I think they probably needed religion 

411
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,370
back then.
We think about how,

412
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,950
how easy life is today and there's so 
many people that need a safety net.

413
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,780
So many people that are terrified so 
many people that want one sanity to this

414
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:47,781
and they,
they seek that Saturday and no really 

415
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:48,970
ridiculous mythology,
but back then it was imperative.

416
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,950
You had to have it.

417
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,490
I think Patton Oswald's got some 
brilliant joke about this where he talks

418
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:58,491
about how religion was invented to trick
dumb people that there's a cake in.

419
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:02,490
This guy says he stopped,
like attacking everyone.

420
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,960
Essentially.
It's just really smart.

421
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:08,961
People recognize that there's really 
dumb people that have no qualms in 

422
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:14,001
killing and doing ridiculous things is 
that they tell them this fib to make 

423
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:14,001
them behave.

424
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,230
I can't remember the jokes.
Awesome.

425
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:16,000
Look it up.
Sorry.

426
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,010
It could be possible,
but I've always thought that what I 

427
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,150
mean,
I always joke around about it being for 

428
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,681
dumb people,
but I think there's a pull towards the 

429
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:28,350
idea of something other than us and I 
think we always have had that too.

430
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:33,351
I don't think we're willing to believe 
that we're the end of the evolutionary 

431
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:34,970
food chain or the spiritual food chain.
It seems silly.

432
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,760
It seems much more likely.
Like there's something above us.

433
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:42,761
We just can't even communicate with it.
We're just the same way and can't tell 

434
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:46,511
you stories where we're not able to 
communicate with something that's the 

435
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:47,450
next,
the next level of existence.

436
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,020
Well,
yeah,

437
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:52,490
especially when we're in,
especially when we're so confused by our

438
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,590
environment and we're saddened,
distracted.

439
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:59,591
I mean,
the thing that you were talking about 

440
00:19:59,591 --> 00:19:59,591
initially is,
is something I read this,

441
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:03,611
ah,
the Dalai Lama was in beverly hills 

442
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:06,401
talking to like some rich people and in 
their house doing a home visit and he 

443
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:07,790
said to them,
you know,

444
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,100
here we are years.
You're in Beverly Hills,

445
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:12,170
you have your mansion and all your 
things,

446
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,350
but why are your medicine cabinets 
filled with antidepressants and volume 

447
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:21,800
and antianxiety medication?
Even with all this stuff,

448
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:27,010
you're still experiencing mental 
turbulence to the point where you're 

449
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,590
depressed.
This is the.

450
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,080
If people are still caught up in that 
place,

451
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,200
it's going to be very difficult for them
to to transcend it to a point where you 

452
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,190
could communicate with some higher 
intelligence.

453
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,310
How are you going to do that when you're
caught up in some ridiculous perception 

454
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,260
of the world where you're addicted and 
attached to material things where you're

455
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,280
stuck always wanting

456
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,820
some new thing which just makes you 
perpetually insane.

457
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:52,660
You know?
Well,

458
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,120
that's for a lot of people,
that becomes their focus.

459
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,130
You know,
I think the human beings,

460
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:02,131
you know,
you can look at the shallowness of 

461
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:02,131
materialism and he could say,
God,

462
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:03,070
it's so shallow.
God,

463
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:04,690
it's so silly.
Oh yes,

464
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,460
yes and yes,
but what is it really?

465
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,890
What's going on really well?
Well,

466
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,120
human beings are constantly trying to 
achieve things.

467
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,890
I mean,
that's the point of staying alive.

468
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,160
The point of staying alive is you have 
to achieve success out there while 

469
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,410
you're hunting success while you're 
fishing.

470
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,260
There's a reason why hunting and fishing
is so satisfying.

471
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,720
I haven't been hunting.
I plan on going very soon,

472
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:24,970
but I'm going to go with Steve Rinella.
The guy from that.

473
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,110
Uh,
that mediator show.

474
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,440
Working it out.
Yeah.

475
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,830
Name dropper.
Hey,

476
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:30,260
I need a name.
Drop the fucker.

477
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,130
I didn't even know that is me eating 
show.

478
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,380
We're going to eat.
We're going to hunt bears in Alaska.

479
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,310
Wow.
Yeah.

480
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,930
What the fuck?
Anyway.

481
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,090
Um,
uh,

482
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,040
how did I get onto that?
I'm scared.

483
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,260
I just got scared.
What'd you get?

484
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:48,270
Scared of bears in Alaska.
What we're talking about just before 

485
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,270
that.
Oh,

486
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,270
we're talking about materialism.
Oh,

487
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,690
then I think that it's this.
Oh,

488
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,500
that's right.
Well,

489
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,390
the reason why it's so satisfying.
I did get scared.

490
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,290
Thinking about bears.
Moscow.

491
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,450
You should.
Reason why it's so satisfying.

492
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:58,240
Hunting and fishing is because those 
tasks are.

493
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,170
That's a prerequisite for staying alive 
for the longest time.

494
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,440
For the longest time,
the way we stayed alive as we had to go 

495
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,440
out and gather our food.
It feels good to pick food,

496
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,640
like if you find some blueberry 
somewhere and you pick them,

497
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:14,641
there's like this weird joy that comes 
with your finding and finding a meal 

498
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:18,811
outside that is a natural reward system 
that's put in place to ensure our 

499
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:19,000
survival.

500
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,470
Now when there are no hunting and 
gathering tasks to get when it's so easy

501
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:28,471
to just walk to the store and get meat,
the choice is to meet and it takes 

502
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:33,451
literally seconds.
Can I have that big perfectly aged hunk 

503
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:37,831
of flesh that's has no diseases on it,
ready to cook right away and you know,

504
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,020
can I have this milk that's been 
homogenized and pasteurized and has no 

505
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,071
chance of killing me and I can sit on 
the shelf for weeks and can I have this 

506
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:49,120
cheese that's also the same.
It's very resistant to mold and all.

507
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:54,121
Look at this fresh vegetables that are 
genetically modified and then you can 

508
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:54,790
grow tomatoes in the middle of the 
fucking winter outside.

509
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,210
You know,
it's all of it is incredible,

510
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,140
but also easy and so accessible that 
there's no reward.

511
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,180
You're not getting that reward,
so people will just.

512
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,310
They're.
They're being gluttonous,

513
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,670
unlike the native Americans who the 
flesh was so important to them to kill 

514
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,610
with so important.
Everything was so sacred that they would

515
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,790
use every single part of the animal to 
honor that animal and they wanted to 

516
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,190
keep this relationship with the buffalos
and what the,

517
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,120
the deer and all the animals that they 
needed to sustain them.

518
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,240
For us,
that system is hijacked,

519
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,010
hijacked by sports cars.
It's hijacked by getting ahead.

520
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,430
Uh,
you know,

521
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,260
getting a house in the hamptons.
It's high,

522
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,580
it's high jacked by having a boat.
It's hijacked by all the things that you

523
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:41,581
can reward yourself for women.
Maybe it's jewelry or shoes where when 

524
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:42,760
it's shoes,
a lot of women that they become obsessed

525
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:46,490
with fucking handbags and shit.
I was reading about this woman who was,

526
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:51,491
um,
some super billionaire's daughter and 

527
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:51,491
uh,
he's,

528
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:51,491
you know,
I,

529
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:54,650
I say is like super ridiculously 
wealthy.

530
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,540
She has a million dollar bathtub that's 
made out of crystal,

531
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,190
like she has a bathtub that is a million
dollars and they imported from Mexico.

532
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,150
It's her bathtub,
a million dollars.

533
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,040
That's like an awesome house.
A million dollars.

534
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,130
She has just incredible supply of 
handbags.

535
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:15,050
It's millions of dollars worth of 
handbags,

536
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,320
millions of dollars worth of shoes,
literally millions of dollars worth of 

537
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,320
shoes.
You know,

538
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,120
there's people that start,
they get crazy and start buying high end

539
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:28,330
handmade watches that are a million 
dollars and they look like a fucking 

540
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:28,330
timex.
Yeah,

541
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,870
I mean I'm exaggerating,
but they don't look this,

542
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,780
this watch watches.
It's called a tw steel.

543
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,210
It's a,
it's a nice watch.

544
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:38,090
It's like it's like a 150 bucks on 
Amazon.com

545
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:39,890
or something like that.
For me it's perfect.

546
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:41,360
It's like cool looking.
I like it.

547
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,970
It's not flashy,
it's not.

548
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm trying to stick out in your face,
but I like the way a good machine look 

549
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,470
looks,
you know,

550
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,840
something that's designed well and 
that's what that looks like.

551
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:54,080
But some people get crazy and they'll 
take it to.

552
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,570
I'd want the finest watched constructed 
in the most difficult manner.

553
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,580
Let go in a bottle.
I want them to make the watch in a 

554
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:03,580
bottle with tweezers,
you know,

555
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,561
and I want it to be all magnetized and 
all of it's titanium and hand carved and

556
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:09,380
get the fuck

557
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,880
made in the bottles to the no dust gets 
in it.

558
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:13,960
Is that the reason for that?
Just made the bottle part up.

559
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,010
It's like making a ship in the bottle.
Why the fuck would you make a ship in 

560
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,010
the ball?
It's stupid.

561
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,680
Who cares you?
It's harder for you.

562
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,120
Really.
Fucking chip is like whatever.

563
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,920
Like I'm not good.
It's a mystery.

564
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,950
I say make something better.
That's,

565
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,410
that's you know,
right in front of you.

566
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,420
Stupid.
Why are you making things inside 

567
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,420
bottles?
It's a challenge.

568
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,770
It's like tetris back in the old days.
It's outrageous.

569
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,170
But Dude,
posture is one thing.

570
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,180
One thing that you're leaving out the 
difference between primitive and modern 

571
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,830
peoples living situation.
You also have to take into account their

572
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:45,600
mental state.
People,

573
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,430
uh,
that the native Americans,

574
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:52,431
they believed in like the great spirit.
They didn't know too much about the 

575
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:53,670
universe and the way that we know it.

576
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,080
They like had this faith in a kind of 
ancient religion that,

577
00:25:58,081 --> 00:25:59,970
um,
that gave them a lot of comfort.

578
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,060
The modern guy who's buying all the ham 
and the meat and the fucking ship 

579
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,290
watches and bottles and the,
and the crazy woman buying the person's,

580
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,450
it gets even more absurd because their 
belief in the universe is either,

581
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:17,451
you know,
a fundamentalist Christian or religious 

582
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,090
belief that's always haunted by science.
It all sides.

583
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,030
The whole world is telling them,
you know,

584
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,480
a lot of that stuff isn't true.
A lot of that stuff doesn't,

585
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,050
uh,
didn't really happen.

586
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:26,940
The people,
the way they're describing that,

587
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:29,760
nobody flew up into the air.
Now guys flew up into the air,

588
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:32,280
came,
came back to life after he got nailed to

589
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:34,500
a cross that's never happened.
Doesn't happen this.

590
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,590
So they're fucking main.
The tenants of their religion are always

591
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:39,180
getting attacked on all sides by 
science.

592
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,430
And if you're not religious then you 
exist.

593
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:44,280
Like if you're an atheist,
then it even more weird.

594
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:49,281
You're just some like super smart 
primate that's been stuck on a ball.

595
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,470
You're December like tiny little tiny 
thinking,

596
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:57,471
little primate bug thing that the force 
of gravity is keeping stuck to the 

597
00:26:57,471 --> 00:27:01,941
ground on a planet spinning around like 
your Joe Spinning around a ball of 

598
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:04,350
fucking fire,
so it's like if you don't really believe

599
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,480
in God when you're in this super absurd 
situation,

600
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:11,481
which is,
it's like now I have infinite amount of 

601
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:13,620
food and whatever I want,
but I'm just some absurd little speck of

602
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:14,800
something.
You don't have to believe.

603
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,920
I mean,
not all atheists think that by the way,

604
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:19,140
but it is an absurd place to get to.

605
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:24,250
I maintained that the reality of living 
on a planet in orbit around the Star in 

606
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:30,581
the galaxy,
in a universe is so preposterous and 

607
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:32,600
bizarre and strange that it doesn't 
matter if you call it,

608
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,980
you know,
big thunder,

609
00:27:33,981 --> 00:27:36,920
God in the sky,
and it doesn't matter if you're,

610
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:37,460
you know,
you,

611
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:39,710
you,
you have some mythology attached to it.

612
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,890
Your reality is your perceptions,
your own perceptions of it are so 

613
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:45,740
abstract.
Yep.

614
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,790
There's so not,
that's not something.

615
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,810
Even if you'd have to have fucking been 
to space,

616
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:54,770
you'd have to have to go to a planet or 
at least orbit the moon or something.

617
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,780
Just really wrap your fucking head 
around the fact that there's some other 

618
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,020
shit out there.
It just seems like you're telling me it,

619
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,270
but it's abstract.
I know the numbers.

620
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,760
Hundreds of billions of galaxies.
Fourteen billion.

621
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:09,800
I know the numbers.
They're abstracting.

622
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,950
It sounds to me it doesn't sound real.
I think that's religion sounds equally 

623
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:17,060
abstract.
You know,

624
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:18,810
you,
you can believe in,

625
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,980
and I'm not comparing science,
religion and sciences,

626
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,260
you know,
been measured and it makes sense.

627
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,300
Most of religion is silly,
but I think to us,

628
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,560
I just saying,
I think to us the reality of our 

629
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,871
situation is so preposterous that it's 
almost like religion had to be put in 

630
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:43,301
place to describe it.
It really makes you wonder like how 

631
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:44,930
quickly people came,
became conscious because like,

632
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,350
all this stuff was shit we had to deal 
with like really early on,

633
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,390
you know,
like we,

634
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,720
where are we?
What's going on,

635
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:52,130
where is this from?
And then,

636
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:53,420
you know,
Bill weld the thunder.

637
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:57,800
God came down from the sky and like we 
had to like really early on,

638
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:59,690
had to come up with some fucking 
answers.

639
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:05,670
That's one of the cool things about 
Buddhism is that it doesn't have like a 

640
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,661
thunder.
It doesn't talk about a thunder God or 

641
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,581
something.
It's more like someone recognizing that 

642
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:13,060
is whatever these absurd beings are on 
this planet.

643
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,480
We all kind of share the same similar 
problems.

644
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:20,890
There we are all sharing the same 
similar problems and then an analysis of

645
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:24,010
those problems created like the system 
of Buddhism,

646
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:27,970
which is a way to overcome the thing 
that's trying to make you buy a shitload

647
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:31,810
of purses and cars and the thing that's 
making you miserable while you're laying

648
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,700
in your fucking nice bed in your 
apartment.

649
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:36,340
It's acknowledging that if you're 
fucking hunting,

650
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,180
hunting bears is a native American or if
you're lying in your fucking bed is a 

651
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,441
modern pepperoni stuffed rich man.
You both have the same problem,

652
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:51,040
which is you're going to die.
You're going to get old,

653
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,870
you're going to get disease.

654
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,030
You're going to get old age,
disease and death.

655
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:00,060
This is an inevitability that we all 
share in that all humans have shared 

656
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,630
since the beginning of time.
You can't escape it.

657
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,780
So the cool thing about Buddhism is it's
not like if you have prayed to the 

658
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,720
mighty loon loon,
you'll get a blessing.

659
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:08,770
It's like,
alright,

660
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,800
let's sober up.
Can we calm down?

661
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,570
Can we overcome all the fucking 
distractions that are surrounding us?

662
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:21,571
Can we focus our will to a point where 
we're no longer being buffeted by 

663
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:24,000
circumstances like all of our ancestors 
app?

664
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,320
And that's enlightenment,
man.

665
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,890
When you wake up and you overcome the 
fucking

666
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,380
sort of a,
you know,

667
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,910
I mean,
is it real enlightenment?

668
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:31,350
No,
it's,

669
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:31,950
it's,
it's,

670
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,990
you're,
you're sort of managing your situation.

671
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:39,991
You're sort of reacted dealing 
realistically with what does that even 

672
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:41,170
mean?
What inevitable?

673
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:42,820
What is the inevitable?
What is the death?

674
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,420
You know,
you're just,

675
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,190
all you know is that this ends.
You don't even know what,

676
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,170
what takes place next,
if anything,

677
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,480
you know nothing.
And for a lot of people just that I 

678
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,971
think was too much and people also have 
that natural primate need to be right.

679
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,360
The need to follow the Alpha need to 
have someone who seems to be the leader 

680
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,820
of the gang and it's,
it's almost impossible to do that unless

681
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:08,860
you got a religion rock and it's really 
hard.

682
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:11,680
It's really hard unless you have not 
just a guy,

683
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,950
but a guy who appeals to the gods and 
you know,

684
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,250
an intermediary.
Someone who's like,

685
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:23,310
God's manager makes it's way easy to run
shit because you're like way closer to 

686
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,310
God.

687
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,830
It's a funny.
I mean,

688
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,850
it's the greatest trick ever.
If you drink a bunch of people to think 

689
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,640
that you're the one who can communicate 
with God,

690
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,060
like,
yeah,

691
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:30,540
I wrap it up,

692
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,140
but it does represent God as every cult 
not pulled that move.

693
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,670
I mean,
that's like everyone.

694
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,240
People want to believe Shit,
man.

695
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,970
There's a lot of people don't want to 
believe shit.

696
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,680
You could start a cult for real.
Yeah,

697
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,790
easily.
Oh No.

698
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:44,400
I'd never started call.
Of course you would never start a call,

699
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,610
but you could start a call if you want 
to do.

700
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,010
If you were a crazy person,
you'd be really good at it.

701
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,610
You think so?
Oh yeah.

702
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,340
That's the nicest thing you've ever said
to me.

703
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,560
You looked like Manson.
You could totally do it.

704
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,750
You're a charismatic guy.
You're very intelligent.

705
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,340
You're right.
You can spin a yarn,

706
00:31:59,341 --> 00:32:02,720
you all their prerequisites for someone 
being a cult leader.

707
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,890
Right?
Yeah.

708
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:08,891
You know,
I think that it would be much more fun 

709
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:08,891
to,
um,

710
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:10,520
to just be part of what's actually 
happening on the planet.

711
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,670
Yeah.
To be part of that,

712
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,200
that's a massive distraction.
To be in a cult of work.

713
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,960
Way more confusing and get the work 
running a colt man.

714
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:21,600
It's like,
that's a lot of fucking organization.

715
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,840
It would be terrible.
I'd have sex.

716
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:27,720
I bet though you would have,
but it's all tricks.

717
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,390
Sex.
Let me tell you something.

718
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,870
Only sex you want in life period.
Unless you just,

719
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,490
unless you just got to get a hooker and 
you just to get your Dick sucked,

720
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,240
period.
You know,

721
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:39,030
you're just a guy who just never gets 
laid and you got to do.

722
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,070
You got to do.
Other than that,

723
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,550
what you really want,
ideally sex with people want to have sex

724
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:46,290
with you.
You don't want that trick sex,

725
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,070
you know that I'm the Messiah.
Tricks acts.

726
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,600
We're going to get mad at you,
man.

727
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,220
Somewhere along the line someone's going
to get mad at you.

728
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,990
You should only have sex with people 
that genuinely want to have sex.

729
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,410
Have you?
Have you ever had payments?

730
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:02,411
Sex,
like where you did something and they 

731
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:02,411
felt like they had to have sex with,
just as a payment.

732
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,100
That was,
that was,

733
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,010
that was the worst.
Why?

734
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,330
What did you,
what did change the story a little bit.

735
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:13,400
It's a girl that wanted me to do some 
stuff for her and so I did it for just 

736
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,890
thinking like I thought she was just 
cute,

737
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,960
but then right when it was done,
she's just like,

738
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:19,640
okay,
and she comes into the next room,

739
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,410
just takes off her clothes and I'm.

740
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,700
And I'm like,
Oh fuck Ya.

741
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:27,500
And I fucker.
And then then she left and then we later

742
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:30,440
she wanted to do some more stuff and so 
I did it and she goes,

743
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:35,470
look,
I'm on my period right now after I was 

744
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:35,470
done with it.
She goes,

745
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:35,470
I'm on my period right now,
but it kind of gets you the next time.

746
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,170
And I'm like,
okay,

747
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,520
she needs to tell her about money.
Yeah.

748
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:44,420
Can I get so wow.
You know,

749
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,950
we should have had this conversation off
the air.

750
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:48,140
I want to know who the fuck this is.
Um,

751
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,680
yeah.
You give me a hint now you wouldn't 

752
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,601
know.
I would have to explain it or you'd be 

753
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:55,601
like,
Eh,

754
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:55,601
I eventually you.
Oh yeah,

755
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:59,051
yeah.
Is this a long time ago this happened 

756
00:33:59,051 --> 00:33:59,051
or.
Yeah,

757
00:33:59,051 --> 00:33:59,051
it's like seven years ago.
Wow.

758
00:33:59,051 --> 00:33:59,840
That's funny.
I've never,

759
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,130
I've never had that happen before.

760
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,400
I've never had that.
But I have lent money in the past to 

761
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,400
people at dated.
Yeah.

762
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,680
But it's never really alone.
They mostly hate doing that though.

763
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,230
I've noticed that people hate that man.
People hate.

764
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,530
They hate when they're stuck.
They hate when they have no one to turn 

765
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:17,530
to.
You know,

766
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,950
all of a sudden like,
your bills are piling up and you fucking

767
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:21,470
transmission brakes and you literally 
can't get to work.

768
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,370
That happens to be super normal.
It happens all the time.

769
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,450
You know,
sucks.

770
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:28,940
People hate to be in a position.
Most people do.

771
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,270
The people who liked to be in a position
to ask people for money all the time,

772
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,490
those are a pain in the ass,
you know,

773
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,530
and especially,
you know,

774
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:41,830
dudes who just always seem to be in a 
spot where you never can get out of 

775
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,630
this.
I always in a bind what it was.

776
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,710
What do you,
why are you spending so much for all 

777
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,141
your on this house?
Why is this car so much when you're 

778
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:50,141
broken that you're always needing money?
Dude,

779
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:51,510
you gotta manage your situation.
You know,

780
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,350
if you want better things in life,
you've got to make more money.

781
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:56,290
Man.
You can't like pretend you had more.

782
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,280
Part of it is credit,
credit,

783
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,620
credit,
credit.

784
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,630
No one's forcing you to tell you what,
how you in credit cards so you,

785
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:03,200
you,
you,

786
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,720
you,
you're a broke person being a waiter and

787
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:06,890
you're making shit.
No money,

788
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:08,340
but you want a new TV.
You run it.

789
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,320
You see all your friends have tvs.
What we just talked about,

790
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,690
silly,
but what sucks is that that it should be

791
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,290
fair for credit card companies to charge
like what they're doing now up to 30,

792
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,800
30 percent or something like that.
That's criminal.

793
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:22,510
I mean that's,
that's,

794
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,400
that should be against the law.
Totally criminal and most people pay the

795
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:30,401
minimum and you'll pay that off for the 
rest of your life and you're just keep 

796
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:33,041
paying them and you'll know you will 
have paid so much more money than you 

797
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:33,041
spent.
It's criminal,

798
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,490
but dude,
a lot of people are in a trans man.

799
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,070
A lot of people are in a serious fucking
trans and

800
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,390
like,

801
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,030
Oh

802
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,260
sure,

803
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:32,580
change the environment of the show.
It's just like that amazing lane that 

804
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,730
was.
We did a podcast with Brendan loss and 

805
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,440
they do that every episode where they do
that.

806
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:46,490
They do things like that.
Like they sit there for like five 

807
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,221
minutes,
like making crazy noises for no reason 

808
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:49,221
at all.
I didn't know where.

809
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:52,790
I bet that would be a funny podcast 
because Brendan Walsh is a funny 

810
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:52,790
motherfucker.
This one guy,

811
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,970
by the way,
there's a podcast whole network of um,

812
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
called death squad that were also 
involved in Brian runs all of them and 

813
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,720
they're all on itunes and all for free 
and they include the ice house 

814
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,711
chronicles,
which I think is one of the best 

815
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:06,711
podcasts we do and what the icehouse 
chronicles is.

816
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:09,590
We're actually going to do one after I 
do this podcast with Duncan and what is,

817
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:11,820
is while the show was going on at the 
ice house,

818
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:15,210
we also come over here and we fuck 
around and talk shit and have a podcast,

819
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,910
a lot of fun and it's a real green room.

820
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,740
Like it's an actual green room of the 
show.

821
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,900
Like you'll see people saying like,
Oh shit,

822
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:24,060
am I on my own now?
And then they'll run out of the room and

823
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,220
go onstage.
It's,

824
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,050
it's really cool.
I like that,

825
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,930
that Paul Provenza show,
the green room I enjoyed.

826
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,400
I enjoy whenever you can get,
you know,

827
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,270
Stan hope and Dave attell and Janeane 
Garofalo in a room together and let them

828
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,270
argue.
Jamie Kilstein,

829
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,600
whoever was in that,
you know,

830
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,070
I,
I enjoy that,

831
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:46,071
but this is a real green room of a real 
show of a bunch of guys who worked 

832
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:50,301
together on a regular basis and you're 
not going to get any weird awkwardness 

833
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,930
or people you know,
that are attacking people.

834
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:55,010
Most of it is just a lot of fun with 
occasionally Brian,

835
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,020
we'll bring someone in here and fuck.
Are these people Brian Case we've had 

836
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,340
only four major instances,
but those have been love those.

837
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,820
They love those moments.
Yeah.

838
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,080
We've got a few incidents where Brian 
brought people in and be like,

839
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,530
this person,
she can't talk anymore.

840
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,180
Brian,
like,

841
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:13,440
Hey,
get out of here.

842
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,040
I can't tell you but this,
you know,

843
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,460
he knows people in that shit.
Some shady businesses keep on running 

844
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,850
into shady shit.
Shitty Shit.

845
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,120
Yeah,
that's a lot of it.

846
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,160
I think it might in the future,
like I'm ready to completely do 

847
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,160
something.
I thought about this the other day.

848
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,070
I'm ready date somebody that I would 
have dated when I was 21,

849
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,200
like like when I was 21,
I was date someone that you should be 

850
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:40,730
dating when you're 37.
The crazier asshole.

851
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,650
Even scarier.
Thirty seven year olds in Los Angeles.

852
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:49,651
That's the scariest bottom of the weird.
Sometimes for the most part the is 

853
00:38:49,651 --> 00:38:54,540
really bad times.
It's like you and sometimes it's like 

854
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,031
Duncan.
Sometimes it's a guy or girl for you 

855
00:38:57,031 --> 00:39:00,120
who's at a certain point in their life 
has actually learned a lot of shit and 

856
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,120
it's actually fun to be around.

857
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:05,790
We all assume chauvinistically as men,
especially that when you meet a girl 

858
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,080
that's in their late thirties,
she just going to be a fucking wreck.

859
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,400
She goes to screaming wreck of 
desperation and fear and blame my age.

860
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:17,890
Want to make babies quick so they trick 
you.

861
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,960
They try to play exactly who they think 
you want you to be interested in me.

862
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,970
Yeah,
I know someone who absolutely 

863
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,511
unquestionably was tricked.
The girl he was dating was older and 

864
00:39:30,511 --> 00:39:32,740
they like right away,
started dating and she said that she was

865
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:36,010
on the pill and she got off the pill 
immediately.

866
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,320
She immediately knew that she was only 
like,

867
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,410
I think she was like 35 or 36,
which is.

868
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,050
Well,
that's where it gets with women.

869
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,590
Not all women,
obviously most of them that aren't 

870
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,361
deceptive,
but where it gets with some women it's 

871
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:51,361
like,
listen,

872
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:51,361
I don't give a fuck what he wants.

873
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:55,710
I only get one more shot at this.
I'm not going to be in some sort of 

874
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,471
relationship with some guy by the way,
who has plenty of money so he can take 

875
00:39:58,471 --> 00:39:58,540
care of this thing.
Even if the kid doesn't work out,

876
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,280
this is what I want.
I want a child.

877
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,800
This guy's got money,
he's got genetics,

878
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,800
and they'll just take the loads.
They'll just take the loads and you have

879
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:09,820
to pretend that you have to somehow or 
another,

880
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,440
you know,
you have to.

881
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,940
If you're,
if you're having sexually or when you're

882
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:14,440
not wearing a condom,
you know,

883
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:19,441
you have to realize that that's a 
possibility that someone could do that 

884
00:40:19,441 --> 00:40:20,410
and it's totally illegal by the way she 
can do that.

885
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:24,010
And you know,
even if she was deceptive,

886
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:29,011
I don't think she could lose in court.
I think she could probably say it's her 

887
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:29,011
business.

888
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:29,011
You know,
I,

889
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:29,011
I think you're,
you're,

890
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:33,931
whether or not you took the pills.
Anybody ever sued someone based on 

891
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,741
whether or not they took the pill.
The pill is like they say it's 99 

892
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:37,860
percent effective.
I bet it's 100 percent effective.

893
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,260
Just one people.
Such wretched line cons.

894
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,350
It's unprovable in court.
You know,

895
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,520
it's very possible that the pill is just
straight up affective.

896
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:49,820
Would you ever get your shit a snipped,
like maybe save some sperm that.

897
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,840
Yeah.
Did he say to you the sperm also a no.

898
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:56,740
He did not say I save your spring break.
That could be reversed,

899
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,190
but doug's loads at this point or to 
fucking completely useless.

900
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,440
His loads will come out like a wet 
cardboard.

901
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:06,810
There's no way they're impregnating 
anybody getting reversed.

902
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:09,760
This has this weird visual that your 
penis would be just so broken looking.

903
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,900
No,
it's not.

904
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,760
You're paying this.
It's under something with your balls.

905
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,140
You know,
you wouldn't even see that.

906
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:16,150
But the innards man,
that's what's really crazy.

907
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:18,520
Trying to reattach a tube and it might 
not work.

908
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:20,470
It might not take.
Yeah.

909
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,520
This is like the worst felony.
Well,

910
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,070
there's another way of doing it.
That is another way of doing it.

911
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,230
There's a new way.
Um,

912
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,360
I saw online where they're doing it now 
with like a clip there actually bending 

913
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,010
it

914
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,110
and pinching it and cutting off with a 
clip.

915
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,260
And the idea behind the clip is that it 
could be reversible,

916
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,800
but I always think that like,
you know,

917
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,440
you're doing Jujitsu and some guy goes 
neon belly on you,

918
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:47,330
hard pops your fucking flip out.
And next thing you know,

919
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:49,070
well listen man,
that's the reality.

920
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:54,490
You get a big guy on you.
And so I control neon bellies and 

921
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:54,490
motherfucker.
Dude,

922
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:54,800
it's,
you got to have tight abs.

923
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:56,120
I do.
I do my sit ups.

924
00:41:56,121 --> 00:42:01,121
That's what I think.
I don't want to get stuck with some big 

925
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:01,121
fucking guy,
neon belly.

926
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:01,250
That's what I do.
That's what I think of when I'm doing my

927
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:01,670
setups.
Ups,

928
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,000
you just gave me an anxiety attack.
I don't get anxiety attacks.

929
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,360
Just do sit ups with 25 pound plates 
while you're hanging by your ankles.

930
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,490
This is what you do.
Took a 25 pound plate.

931
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,520
You put it by your chest and you hang by
your ankles and just all the way you're 

932
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,960
fucking slow control at Dunkin,
even if you only do one.

933
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:23,390
How to keep me from having an 
illegitimate child choice stomach 

934
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:23,390
muscles.

935
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,550
I'm going to teach you about bald 
eagles.

936
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:31,040
That's the next thing I'm going to teach
you about how to Cagle your boss.

937
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,130
You know women do eagles to keep their.
Their pussy tight.

938
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,170
Apparently you could do that to Kohl's 
just from down.

939
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,250
Shut the floors.
It's a really weak muscle.

940
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:42,800
If you try to squeeze your Dick Muscle 
right now as you're sitting here,

941
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,150
just going to try to.
It's so weak.

942
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,280
I have no dick squeezing endurance at 
all.

943
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,930
That's why when you,
when you're,

944
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,490
when you have to come,
you don't want to come.

945
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:54,320
It's so hard,
you know,

946
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,260
when,
when you're like,

947
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:00,340
don't fucking move,
don't move and just grab her and hold 

948
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,581
her in place to move and you're going 
crazy and it just forget it.

949
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,400
That's when load sneak out and that's 
how people get pregnant.

950
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,830
Do you believe the idea?
Yeah,

951
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,370
that I'm like the galleries in the 
tantric sex,

952
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:16,910
people believe that you actually lose 
energy when you come,

953
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:20,240
like if you come too much,
you're losing some form of energy.

954
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:21,530
Now.
Like some boxers,

955
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,170
they won't ejaculate like before a 
fight,

956
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,570
but they won't have sex before a fight 
because they want to.

957
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:31,830
Well,
they've actually proven physiologically 

958
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,520
proven that if you don't have any 
release within seven days,

959
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:37,060
your testosterone goes up significantly.
Significantly.

960
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:38,620
Like measurably,
I think.

961
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,620
I don't remember the actual number,
but it was enough so that it would.

962
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,510
It would warrant doing that if you were 
a fighter,

963
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,490
but for some fighters there,
the difficult thing is relaxing.

964
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:53,610
The difficult thing is getting in there 
and being able to fight up to your 

965
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:53,860
potential.
It's not the amount of testosterone that

966
00:43:53,861 --> 00:43:57,700
you're producing,
it's how well are you in control of your

967
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:01,000
mind because your mind is what's going 
to guide you through this fucking thing.

968
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:06,001
Your mind is going to have to deal with 
the consequences of nipples come and 

969
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:08,110
flying at your face and jumping knees 
and dudes try to take you down to try to

970
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:13,111
throw you literally on your head.
Your mind is dealing with all this and 

971
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:16,831
your mind has gotta be on point and your
mind has got to be relaxed enough to not

972
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:22,951
freeze up,
relax enough to respond to the pressure 

973
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,900
and do the smart thing and not not get 
exhausted quickly because of anxiety.

974
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:29,620
That's a big problem with guys.
They're mine gets them so like this that

975
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:34,621
their bodies like,
I can't do this anymore because they're 

976
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:34,621
so

977
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:37,040
inefficient.
They're so completely inefficient in 

978
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,561
their use of their body that everything 
is a is a strain and everything is a 

979
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:42,000
sprint and they become exhausted like 
almost immediately.

980
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:47,270
Yeah.
Learning to get in that fucking 

981
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,270
statement.
By the way,

982
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,270
I was.
What I was saying is in that case,

983
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:52,071
I would say that you should have sex 
because then you're not going to at 

984
00:44:52,071 --> 00:44:52,140
least think about the sex because if 
you're not having sex,

985
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,050
you're built up with those testosterone 
and you're just thinking about pussy and

986
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:00,060
are so confused.
You might not even be able to be 

987
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,481
comfortable in their you.
It might not be able to like get loose 

988
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:02,481
in there,
you know?

989
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:04,980
Whereas if you're,
if you get it out of your system,

990
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,270
you get the sex that you're still going 
to be,

991
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,140
you still feel great.
I mean,

992
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,360
I mean,
how much of an effect does it have on 

993
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:13,360
you?

994
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:13,360
It doesn't have an effect on you where 
you go to the gym and your week.

995
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,720
Now I'm at sex and go the gym and I feel
great.

996
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,200
It's not that much of a problem.
I think for a lot of guys you'd be 

997
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,540
better off just having a sex to calm 
down.

998
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,770
Get it out of your system.
Yeah.

999
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:24,110
I look at it,
I'm like,

1000
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,430
don't ask me man.
Like I,

1001
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:30,431
I,
maybe you can go like four days without 

1002
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:30,431
jerking off.
I'm not having sex the mud,

1003
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:32,910
so I have no idea the whole here's the 
perfect mystery to me,

1004
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,980
Taoism and the whole contract thing.
I just don't know if it's something I 

1005
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,290
wonder about because it's two systems 
that both,

1006
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:45,590
you know,
have really developed systems around 

1007
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:48,411
this idea of like extending your orgasm.
Like somehow they can like supposedly 

1008
00:45:49,561 --> 00:45:51,900
make their orgasms lasts much,
much,

1009
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:52,910
much sting.

1010
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,940
Isn't that right?
But you would think we would be like 

1011
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,670
really that in tune with everything is 
fucking songs we better lately.

1012
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,060
Right.
You know,

1013
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,700
like a long time ago,
they were awesome.

1014
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,260
You know,
the old sting.

1015
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,270
What was the last time sting had a good 
new song.

1016
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:12,050
Does he have songs anymore?
Songs I heard that were new that came 

1017
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,040
out while I was playing a gravy or 
whatever.

1018
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,580
That's field the gravy.
Well him and his wife,

1019
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:20,670
they have like these 30 minute sessions,
but where's your music bro?

1020
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:21,590
Why?
You know,

1021
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:26,620
I mean it.
Was he putting out music that I'm not 

1022
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:26,620
aware of.
Did you say 30 minute?

1023
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:26,620
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1024
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,940
yeah.
It was like crazy tantric orgasms where 

1025
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:30,940
they last minute orgasm.
Yeah.

1026
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,190
Yeah,
for real or imagined the smell on that.

1027
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:32,880
What do you think?

1028
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:40,490
Hey,
what do you think would happen if you 

1029
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,501
had a 24 hour orgasm feel great.
I think I would suck.

1030
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,160
I take you.
I think.

1031
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:44,980
I don't know,
man.

1032
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:47,820
Do you think it would be wasted?
You'd be exhausted by the time was over,

1033
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:48,900
but yeah,
probably feel great.

1034
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,120
Can you mentioned trying to eat while 
having an orgasm,

1035
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,490
like you're at subway train order.
That'd be embarrassing.

1036
00:46:54,491 --> 00:46:56,340
It would be the worst thing would be the
worst drug.

1037
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:58,500
He'd always be around people coming like
wherever,

1038
00:46:58,501 --> 00:47:01,950
like you'd go to parties and everyone's 
just sat on the couch having orgasms.

1039
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,960
That's totally possible.
By the way,

1040
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,800
that's not like a really difficult thing
to represent chemical.

1041
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:07,690
I bet.
Yeah.

1042
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:12,710
I don't think it is.
I think they could come up with an 

1043
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,601
orgasm pill that's around the corner.
No one ever would have thought a hard 

1044
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:17,250
dick pill would have been feasible or 
achievable so quickly and easily.

1045
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:22,810
No plague of so many fucking think how 
hard it would have been to have an 

1046
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:27,951
erection.
When you're looking down at your wife's 

1047
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:30,981
flea covered pussy that hasn't had a 
shower and yeah,

1048
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,770
there's no showers.
It could even be if they bathed,

1049
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,180
you had to get like buckets of water.
He had to bring them by the river.

1050
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:41,200
By the time you get to go over and over 
again to probably take you an hour and a

1051
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,660
half each fucking trip back and forth,
back and forth.

1052
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,880
I'll get the rest of it tomorrow.
Then what do you do?

1053
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:47,690
You boil the water.
What's going on there?

1054
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,900
Or just take an ice cold bath.
Yeah.

1055
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,260
Then you draw your dirty ass off on some
fucking skin.

1056
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,000
Still Gross.
Dirty again?

1057
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,050
Yeah.
What did people smell like back there?

1058
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:09,510
What if it balanced out?
If like all the bacteria in your body 

1059
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,650
will just fight each other off until it 
got to like a balanced warfare state.

1060
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,940
You know,
the issue with us is that we clean our 

1061
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,740
skin so much that we lose a lot of the 
healthy bacteria outside of your skin.

1062
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,590
That's one of the,
uh,

1063
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,720
problems with people that have A.
I'm obsessive compulsive and they have 

1064
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,390
to clean everything.
What is that?

1065
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:30,391
A phobia?
What is it called when you're afraid of 

1066
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:30,391
germs?
Yeah.

1067
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:32,560
Howie Mendell gets warts on his hands 
apparently.

1068
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:38,550
Yeah,
because he uses that hand cleaner so 

1069
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:38,550
much.
It's heavy.

1070
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:38,650
It's getting worse.
It's getting worse.

1071
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:43,651
Somebody.
We had a podcast the other day where 

1072
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:43,651
somebody knew he won't even touch 
knuckles with you anymore.

1073
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:44,560
He used to touch knuckles,
but now he won't even do that.

1074
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,220
You know what,
man,

1075
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:50,221
we've already talked about this,
but when you consider how filthy the 

1076
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:52,300
assholes and most people in the western 
world are,

1077
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:57,570
it kind of makes sense man,
because like we've sort of using toilet 

1078
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:58,720
paper to wipe your.

1079
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,640
You're using toilet paper.
Yes.

1080
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:05,670
That is gross.
But being such a Germaphobia is 

1081
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,940
preposterous because we are not one 
thing.

1082
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,360
We're terrified of these germs,
but we have germs in us.

1083
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:13,180
We are germs.
You know we're not just one thing.

1084
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:14,680
You should clean your hands.
Yes,

1085
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:16,870
for sure.
You should definitely wash your dishes.

1086
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,370
You should clean your ass.
You should,

1087
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,530
but you also shouldn't be a fucking 
freak.

1088
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,000
Don't,
don't be crazy about it.

1089
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,430
Don't be afraid to touch a table because
somebody might have touched it before.

1090
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:27,850
You just wash your goddamn hands in each
vegetables so they know.

1091
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,910
They say,
I think,

1092
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:32,590
I mean I get given Duncan a couple stink
watches before where you don't wash your

1093
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:37,591
finger and then when you shake hands you
just kind of rub it on the inside of 

1094
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:37,591
their hand right here and it makes it 
smell food.

1095
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:38,640
Ah Jeez man.

1096
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,820
You guys were talking about on your 
podcast.

1097
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:48,060
It's you asshole Brian.
It just is asking know what I do.

1098
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,930
He sits there and watches his asshole 
for sure.

1099
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,980
And that's completely false.
The you have your asshole and I'm 

1100
00:49:57,451 --> 00:49:58,770
saying,
I'm saying you.

1101
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,260
I'm saying.
I'm saying you.

1102
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:04,020
I'm saying I know you have itched your 
asshole by mistake before or at least at

1103
00:50:04,021 --> 00:50:05,970
least once or twice in life.
Right?

1104
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,990
Make sure that if I do have to itch my 
asshole that I wash my hands afterwards.

1105
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:12,790
I am not convinced that you do the same.
See that.

1106
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,800
See,
that's right there is just spreading 

1107
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:17,800
false information because.
Do you think I really.

1108
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,370
It's my ass and it smells good.
No,

1109
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:25,670
but I do everything that if you were 
tired did you didn't feel like getting 

1110
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,020
up to go wash your hands and your 
asshole,

1111
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,070
you would hit your

1112
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,950
asshole for sure and then go right back 
to keyboard.

1113
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:35,951
No,
I would suck it all and wipe it on my 

1114
00:50:35,951 --> 00:50:35,951
shirt.
Disgusting Man.

1115
00:50:35,951 --> 00:50:40,050
Thirty seven year old man whose name is 
red band.

1116
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,920
We need a commercial.
The adventures of red band.

1117
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,070
The avengers or band made up by you 
because that was all bullshit.

1118
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,350
You.
You know,

1119
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,070
you.
You cry sensitive,

1120
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:54,071
but you're the one who wants to 
interrupt podcasts with digging your 

1121
00:50:54,071 --> 00:50:56,471
asshole stories and that's how it got 
started in the first place you had a 

1122
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:57,320
podcast.
We had a podcast where you jumped in the

1123
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,990
middle of it and started talking about 
you actually getting shit.

1124
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:04,190
You guys tends because you were talking 
about that and that's why you said it.

1125
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:08,250
I don't believe we were,
but the point is you cannot bring to it.

1126
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,980
You guys were just talking about is you 
cannot bring something like that up.

1127
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,400
Yep.
That preposterous.

1128
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:18,550
And then be sensitive about people 
talking about you itching your asshole 

1129
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,950
and having shit.
Although not the only reason I said that

1130
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,420
is because I heard you talk about it on 
Dunkin's podcast that I did this when in

1131
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:25,730
fact I didn't do this.
So who did it?

1132
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:28,550
Your asshole.
I said I have inched my asshole.

1133
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,500
When you judge.
It's not sure asshole.

1134
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:38,480
You cannot be judgmental about guys 
talking about you itching your asshole.

1135
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,130
Do you not understand that you opened up
a door?

1136
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,980
It's like you fit your asshole to.
Yes,

1137
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,940
exactly.
Then what's the big deal?

1138
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,080
I told you I washed my hands and I did 
and I never said I didn't.

1139
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,810
You are a guarantee you.
So I didn't say I wash my hands.

1140
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,220
I didn't wash my hands.
It's your asshole.

1141
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:56,090
And then typing.
All right.

1142
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,520
If you only had like three more words 
type,

1143
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:59,270
you would definitely go.

1144
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:04,270
Well,
wash my hands in a little bit and just 

1145
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:06,350
I'll remember to wash this keyboard off.
I'll make up some shit about you.

1146
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:07,440
Now listen,
Brian,

1147
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,820
want to talk about itching your asshole 
and getting shit on it.

1148
00:52:10,821 --> 00:52:12,560
You cannot be sensitive about that,
man.

1149
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,520
That's silly.
Look,

1150
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:16,400
you live not itched.
Your asshole problems are subject.

1151
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:18,170
It becomes a subject.
Then it becomes fun.

1152
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,870
You can't have you guys here if you're 
an asshole,

1153
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,630
right?
Yes.

1154
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,140
How am I any different?
Because I talked about it.

1155
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:28,450
Yes,
because I'm sorry for that.

1156
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,880
Just based on your normal behavior that 
I.

1157
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:36,150
it's possible.
It's a possible example that you could 

1158
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,700
invest your asshole and then not gone to
the bathroom and washed it.

1159
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,700
It was very possible.
That's very possible.

1160
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,560
So that's what we made fun of,
Dude.

1161
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,220
So fucking relax.
Now you're saying it as if I did though.

1162
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,480
You said on your podcast.
I heard what we said to you.

1163
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,520
It's your asshole.
And then didn't wash and then touching 

1164
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:54,520
everything.
Yeah,

1165
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:54,520
that's what we said.
That's possible.

1166
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,820
That's why it's funny.
Okay.

1167
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,420
We don't know.
Obviously we weren't there while you 

1168
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:01,420
were itching.
Your asshole and touching things.

1169
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:05,820
It's called goofing on you.
You can't goof on yourself in front of 

1170
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,340
us like that and then expect us not to 
also do the same thing.

1171
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,670
If there's anything that we grew fond 
about ourselves during the podcast,

1172
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,980
feel free to goof on it about us.
We're not here.

1173
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:16,160
I mean if you're doing it yourself,
you can't be upset that other people are

1174
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:21,161
doing it.
You're talking about digging your 

1175
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:21,161
asshole,
getting shit all over your hands.

1176
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:22,550
You cannot be upset at other people.
Laughing about that.

1177
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,780
If you want to.
Look,

1178
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,010
I've talked about the podcast,
about shitting my pants.

1179
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,800
I Shit my pants driving home from fear 
factor once.

1180
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,920
Shit my fucking pants plop filled them 
up.

1181
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,010
Just just held it in as long as I can,
but I was like,

1182
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,920
oh,
just I couldn't.

1183
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,050
I couldn't hold it anymore.
I was stuck in traffic.

1184
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,450
It was.
It was a horrible diarrhea moment.

1185
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,550
Feel free to make fun of that because it
actually did happen.

1186
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:48,180
I actually did have to clean my car.
I actually did have to clean my pants is

1187
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:49,590
that shit.
Didn't get into my car,

1188
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:54,591
but my pants were soaking wet with shit,
so that kind of leaked through some of 

1189
00:53:54,591 --> 00:53:58,170
the fabric and got all over my seats so 
I had to get in there with windex.

1190
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:01,080
I used an old toothbrush and shit's 
disgusting.

1191
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,270
That's real,
so you can make fun of that and when you

1192
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:08,330
started talking about digging in your 
ass and getting shit all over your 

1193
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:08,330
hands,
guess what?

1194
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:08,330
Fela,
we're going to joke about it.

1195
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,430
You can't be all sensitive about that 
silly bitch.

1196
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,840
No,
but I've heard you said or did,

1197
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,750
and this is just.
I didn't even listen to the podcast.

1198
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:19,710
What I heard you said is you're saying 
you're telling that Brian stopped down.

1199
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,960
Then stop now.
If you didn't listen to the podcast,

1200
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:23,700
stop now.
Don't ever.

1201
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,760
Don't ever comment on something,
especially in an angry way and not even 

1202
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,260
coming in angry and you're asking why I 
brought it up and that.

1203
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,280
I'm telling you why I brought it up 
because I heard recently he were saying 

1204
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,681
that I did that.
That's how you asked how I brought up 

1205
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:39,291
the situation that I randomly threw in 
something about what you were talking 

1206
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:39,291
about it.
It was a very similar,

1207
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,660
what you guys were trying to settle the 
fundus explained to him.

1208
00:54:41,661 --> 00:54:44,400
I said,
attack you barely on me,

1209
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:44,760
man.

1210
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,670
No,
I'm not crying.

1211
00:54:45,671 --> 00:54:50,671
You're being defensive about the fact 
that we were joking around about you 

1212
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:50,671
itching,
you're being defensive.

1213
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:53,570
You asked me why I randomly brought up 
the fact and I was telling you,

1214
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:58,571
we'll certainly are being defensive and 
arguing about right now is very child 

1215
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:02,490
like that is very defense.
Did you see a dead mouse and Madonna?

1216
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:03,300
Yes,
I did.

1217
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:04,740
That's crazy.
What do you think about this?

1218
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:06,270
Well,
dead mouse is a silly bitch.

1219
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,670
He was making fun of Madonna because 
Madonna,

1220
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,010
Madonna,
like in,

1221
00:55:10,011 --> 00:55:15,011
you know,
people at my message board with totally 

1222
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:15,011
ragging on her for her attempted being 
relevant,

1223
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:19,230
you know,
she gets on stage like who here has 

1224
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:19,230
seeing molly?
Molly is a nickname for MDM,

1225
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,780
which is her new album,
isn't it or is that a DNA?

1226
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,510
Yeah,
but it's written kind of.

1227
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,880
So she's just trying to.
She's trying to pump up our album.

1228
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:32,290
Yeah,
I mean that's part of her thing is 

1229
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:32,290
connecting ourselves to this very,
very popular rave drug.

1230
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:36,150
So I'm dead mouse gets a mad about it 
and he gets pissed at her and saying,

1231
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:37,440
you know,
her daughter,

1232
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,280
you know you're connecting drugs.
So the electronic dance music movement,

1233
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:42,750
and you shouldn't do that.
No,

1234
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,080
you don't need his ideas.
You don't need drugs to enjoy that move.

1235
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,770
The,
the,

1236
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,180
the,
uh,

1237
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,350
the music that he's making or any of 
those artists are making,

1238
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,780
which is true.
You do not need drugs to do that.

1239
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:56,781
I mean,
I've listened to stuff and I enjoyed it 

1240
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:56,781
and I wasn't.
I wasn't on drugs.

1241
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,210
If you took Mtma he's,
he doesn't have any experience in it.

1242
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:02,490
So that's why it's ridiculous.
So for him to say that,

1243
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:03,540
it's like,
man,

1244
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:03,990
you're,
you're,

1245
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:09,050
you're talking shit about an experience 
that for some people is maybe the most 

1246
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:14,120
energetic and positive experience I've 
ever had in their life is being high on 

1247
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,760
ecstasy at a rave.
Listening to dance,

1248
00:56:14,761 --> 00:56:15,270
music,
food,

1249
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,900
being an excellent mgma and standing in 
front of a speaker the size of a house 

1250
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,340
blasting

1251
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,380
out fucking awesome house music.
There's nothing like that.

1252
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,950
It's a cool.
That's the best.

1253
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,650
That's what most people go to see that 
music,

1254
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:33,250
you know,
on.

1255
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:38,251
And Molly,
that's the whole point of listening to 

1256
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:40,051
the music.
But what he's saying is it's giving his 

1257
00:56:40,051 --> 00:56:40,051
electronic music a bad name,
you know,

1258
00:56:40,051 --> 00:56:42,760
like you don't have to enjoy listening 
to that kind of music on my.

1259
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:47,850
But I think that's ridiculous.
That's like saying reggae music without 

1260
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:50,701
marijuana.
That's like saying like rap without 

1261
00:56:50,701 --> 00:56:50,701
stealing a car.
You're certainly not going to.

1262
00:56:50,701 --> 00:56:55,470
That is something I remember that that 
was like back in the day when I used to 

1263
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:59,461
go to the Raves,
that was like one section of people who 

1264
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:00,520
would go to go to the res and a very 
small one.

1265
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:05,910
We're a group of like connoisseurs of 
the music who didn't think that you 

1266
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,590
should pollute your mind with the drugs 
and just enjoy purely enjoy the music.

1267
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,620
Well,
the problem is we had dead mouse on the 

1268
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,091
podcast.
He was drunk as fuck and he wouldn't 

1269
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:15,300
stop smoking cigarettes.
He

1270
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:17,840
chain smoke cigarettes and he was drunk 
as fuck.

1271
00:57:17,841 --> 00:57:19,520
And I enjoyed hanging out with them.
Don't get me wrong,

1272
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,140
I like to do it,
but I think he's,

1273
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,410
I think his whole thought processes is 
really.

1274
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:30,130
It's uninformed.
And I think if he had experiences with 

1275
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,710
psychedelic drugs and music,
I mean not that MDM is a psychedelic and

1276
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,920
you can be happened once that happened,
I think is what they call it,

1277
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,410
but it's impactful.
It is what it is.

1278
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:44,430
It,
it has a Mtma had a very strong 

1279
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,430
influence on my behavior.
It gave me a very,

1280
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:50,540
very deep insight into behavior patterns
and insecurity.

1281
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,300
I said on my message board,
it was like,

1282
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:55,760
I think he could use some Mtma.
I really think it could,

1283
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,830
you know,
not that he's a bad guy,

1284
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,960
but I think that there's a lot of,
a lot of people,

1285
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:03,110
they have a certain amount of 
unnecessary anger inside of them,

1286
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:08,111
a certain amount of unnecessary judgment
and Mtma will knock that shit right out 

1287
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:11,861
of you.
It's such a loving feeling and that's 

1288
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:12,860
one of the reasons why they're using it 
for posttraumatic stress disorder,

1289
00:58:12,861 --> 00:58:15,080
for,
for vets coming back from,

1290
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,720
from Iraq and Afghanistan.
And that's,

1291
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,010
that's a positive thing,
man.

1292
00:58:19,011 --> 00:58:21,920
That's a good thing.
Our people abusing it and dancing.

1293
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:26,980
Of course they are.
But that goes back to what I said in 

1294
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,830
that movie,
the Union people can abuse 

1295
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:29,830
cheeseburgers.
Should we make cheeseburgers illegal?

1296
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,450
I can take a fork and stick in my eyes.
She would make fortunately.

1297
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,580
Do you know how many people a year die 
from drinking?

1298
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,460
The statistic is 100,000.
Yeah,

1299
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:37,800
between 70 and 100.
And that

1300
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,330
doesn't even include drunk driving 
deaths.

1301
00:58:39,331 --> 00:58:41,940
By the way,
the desk themselves to death.

1302
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,990
People die from alcohol poisoning.
People died from overdosing on alcohol.

1303
00:58:45,991 --> 00:58:49,230
People die from sclerosis of the liver 
directly related to alcoholism.

1304
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:54,950
But MTMA is a small amount.
It's like illegal drugs in this country 

1305
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:55,950
is only like 12,000
people die here.

1306
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,170
The real problem is prescription drugs 
right now,

1307
00:58:58,171 --> 00:59:00,120
which you're overcoming drunk driving 
accidents.

1308
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,950
And as far as fatalities,
oh my God.

1309
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:04,410
Those are the words.
People die from those left and right.

1310
00:59:04,411 --> 00:59:05,820
Man.
I have a friend who died,

1311
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,400
but I have a friend who died in New 
York,

1312
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:12,401
a pool player,
and he was a great guy and a straight 

1313
00:59:12,401 --> 00:59:12,401
edge.
He was straight edge,

1314
00:59:12,401 --> 00:59:17,330
made fun of people smoke cigarettes,
and then all of a sudden he hurt his 

1315
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:17,330
back and when he hurt his back,
he had a.

1316
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:21,450
He got on some oxycodones or one of 
those and just that was it ya.

1317
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,110
Bye Bye.
Trains changes.

1318
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,950
Life fell asleep and his mashed 
potatoes.

1319
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,610
Everyone's hanging out together.
The fucking.

1320
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,490
I just falls asleep.
Sitting there eating dinner,

1321
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,630
plopped down,
sat like a movie plot,

1322
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,450
puts his arm down and falls asleep on a 
plate.

1323
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,890
So sad dude.
It's the saddest thing ever,

1324
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:37,850
man.
It really is.

1325
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,880
It's sad.
It's really sad when you consider that 

1326
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:42,890
these drugs,
these synthetic drugs that people are,

1327
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,500
that are killing so many people are semi
legal.

1328
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,200
Alcohol is killing everybody and it's 
totally legal.

1329
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:52,880
Whereas these empath and an empathogen 
like Mtma that when you take it,

1330
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,010
you can.
If you have some discipline,

1331
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,200
you can go dancing.
It's fun to go dancing on it,

1332
00:59:57,201 --> 01:00:02,201
but if you have some discipline,
you can shift your life into the 

1333
01:00:02,201 --> 01:00:03,180
positive forever.
Yes.

1334
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,280
If you have some discipline and if 
you're working with someone or if 

1335
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:08,280
you're.
If you know what you're doing,

1336
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,500
well,
if you're honest with your about your 

1337
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,451
experience of your person who's truly 
looking to improve who you are as a 

1338
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:16,380
person,
I think NBM Mtma can be very impactful.

1339
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:19,770
I didn't like the way it made me feel.
I wouldn't recommend anybody doing it.

1340
01:00:19,771 --> 01:00:20,370
I would say,
man,

1341
01:00:20,371 --> 01:00:25,371
you have to weigh your pros and cons.
Even though it impacted me in a very 

1342
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:28,791
positive way.
I remember feeling absolutely terrible 

1343
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:29,190
the next day.
I don't think it's good for your body.

1344
01:00:29,191 --> 01:00:34,191
I don't want to do it again just,
but I learned a lot from doing it and 

1345
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:36,330
the fact that oxycontin's,
which are literally synthetic,

1346
01:00:36,331 --> 01:00:37,640
Carolyn,
literally this,

1347
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,870
that is what it is.
There's no data.

1348
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,230
It is a synthetic opiate.
It is incredibly,

1349
01:00:43,231 --> 01:00:48,231
incredibly addictive.
People who've done heroin say it's 

1350
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:48,231
easier to kick heroin than it is to kick
pills.

1351
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,510
The oxycontin pills somehow or another,
and the way they're constructed,

1352
01:00:51,511 --> 01:00:54,780
the way it impacts with the human body 
makes them even more addictive.

1353
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,980
It's just insanity.

1354
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,360
Well,
they're fucking fish hooks,

1355
01:00:57,361 --> 01:01:02,361
dude.
There fish hooks coming out of the 

1356
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:02,361
pharmaceutical companies to get stuck in
people's brains.

1357
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:06,180
You get a fucking fish hook in your 
brain attached to a giant corporation.

1358
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:09,510
It's got you fucking wired in whether 
you're getting it legally or not.

1359
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:14,660
It's like telephone wires all connecting
back to the telephone company from the 

1360
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,750
brain's all these pill poppers.
It's just fucking lines going back.

1361
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,650
No benefit whatsoever except a little 
bit of pain relief.

1362
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:25,700
The benefit social,
the social benefit of MTMA would be 

1363
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,130
gigantic.
Madison County and maybe Kim legal.

1364
01:01:27,131 --> 01:01:30,580
You imagine that it was prescribed,
but the problem is also,

1365
01:01:30,581 --> 01:01:32,330
you know,
you got people who would oh,

1366
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,440
on and people who drink when they take 
the,

1367
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,720
there's a,
there's a lot of different 

1368
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:39,720
possibilities.
People could fuck it up.

1369
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:39,720
Yeah,
they can fuck it up.

1370
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,360
And guess what?
They get to you because their,

1371
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:41,480
it's their life and their.

1372
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:46,640
Yes,
and they can do that with alcohol and 

1373
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:46,640
they can do the,
you know,

1374
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,761
the fact that there's all these laws 
against things like MDM and mushrooms 

1375
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:54,681
and things in mushrooms are worth,
really gets crazy because you can't 

1376
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:54,681
overdo,
you know,

1377
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:55,740
who the fuck has ever overdosed on 
mushrooms.

1378
01:01:55,741 --> 01:01:57,660
You have to take,
you have to eat like pounds of it.

1379
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:01,290
The ld 50 rate for for mushrooms is 
really high.

1380
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:06,291
Like you,
you got to be really trying to garbage 

1381
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:06,291
bag.
I think it's like a garbage,

1382
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:09,330
which by the way is you could eat way 
less salt and you'd be dead.

1383
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:14,390
You know,
you get eat like you don't even have to 

1384
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:14,390
eat a pound of salt.
You're fucking gone man.

1385
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:14,430
You Ain't coming back.
You know,

1386
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:19,530
you try to have,
you ate a pound of salt and just sat 

1387
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:19,530
there with a tablespoon and just started
eating salt.

1388
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:20,730
You had a whole pound bag.
That's it.

1389
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,800
That's a wrap kid.
You're dead.

1390
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:23,830
You're dead.
Yeah.

1391
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:28,850
You could die from drinking water.
Remember we were in Sacramento and that 

1392
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:29,060
lady died and a contest.
The contest.

1393
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,250
It's so sad that happened to a frat kid 
too.

1394
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:33,130
They were,
um,

1395
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,490
there were a hazing,
a frat kid.

1396
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:37,470
They made him drink water until he 
couldn't drink anymore.

1397
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:38,320
He fucking died too.

1398
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:39,230
Die.
Yeah.

1399
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,120
It's so fucked up,
man.

1400
01:02:41,121 --> 01:02:41,860
It's a terrible way.

1401
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,840
Go.
Weird laws that protect people.

1402
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:47,210
Cigarettes being legals,
the most preposterous

1403
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:52,220
but,
and also remember like the impulse for 

1404
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,351
many people are taking psychedelics is 
not to try to wipe out the universe,

1405
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:57,510
but it's to try to go deeper into the 
universe.

1406
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:02,660
And so that means that a lot of people 
in the jails right now and a lot of 

1407
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,501
people in the dungeons,
they had the same instincts is like a 

1408
01:03:06,501 --> 01:03:10,311
lot of the great philosophers.
They just wanted to expand their mind 

1409
01:03:10,311 --> 01:03:11,280
and understand a little bit about the 
universe and they're in prison now.

1410
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:14,580
They're imprisoned and so from the 
prohibition,

1411
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:19,581
you're not just getting an inability to 
go enjoy a great fucking night at some 

1412
01:03:19,581 --> 01:03:22,260
underground party or the inability to 
like have a great camping trip with your

1413
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:23,730
pals.
It's literally,

1414
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:28,731
I think,
stifling evolution because God knows 

1415
01:03:28,731 --> 01:03:32,391
what amazing thoughts people could be 
coming up with if there was a regulated 

1416
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:37,791
psychedelics that and we got to explore 
them to understand how to really use 

1417
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:41,400
them and how to really fucking a harness
them to make us smarter.

1418
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:46,670
You know,
this is something that's the birthright 

1419
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:49,671
of humanity.
All indigenous tribes have some form of 

1420
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:52,611
psychedelic that they take.
This is like the ancient people of the 

1421
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:55,971
earth knew about this pot Iowasca.
Yet somehow in the modern age,

1422
01:03:56,311 --> 01:04:01,311
they're keeping us from this experience 
that maybe is the thing that connected 

1423
01:04:01,311 --> 01:04:02,640
the native Americans to the earth that 
you were talking about in the beginning.

1424
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:07,850
Maybe it is the thing that made people 
not so fucking fixated on material 

1425
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:09,300
possessions,
you know,

1426
01:04:09,301 --> 01:04:11,460
but it's white.
We have a prohibition happening now.

1427
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:13,020
It's the dark ages.
It's like,

1428
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:18,021
imagine if there was a book,
just some book and inside of it was 

1429
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,070
amazing information that will teach you 
how to overcome your ego,

1430
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:22,890
that will connect you with your brothers
and sisters around you.

1431
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:28,100
There's this amazing book and it's 
surrounded by a fence that the 

1432
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:28,140
governments are wrecked and they're 
like,

1433
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:29,650
sorry,
I can't read that fucking book.

1434
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:31,680
Can't read it.
It's illegal.

1435
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:33,750
You read that book.
You're going to the dungeon.

1436
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:37,200
If we catch you distributing this book,
copies of this book,

1437
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,690
we put you in the dungeon.
Doesn't make any sense,

1438
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:44,691
man.
Why aren't they letting us read that 

1439
01:04:44,691 --> 01:04:46,191
fucking book?
I don't know anyone who died on 

1440
01:04:46,191 --> 01:04:48,411
mushrooms.
I don't know anyone where anything bad 

1441
01:04:48,411 --> 01:04:48,411
happen to them on mushrooms.
Nobody.

1442
01:04:48,411 --> 01:04:49,080
I've never heard it.
I'm sure it's out there,

1443
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:49,310
but

1444
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,400
I don't.
I've never heard that.

1445
01:04:50,401 --> 01:04:53,060
I've heard a lot of things bad on 
mushrooms.

1446
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,710
All those people were all bitches.
Every person I've ever met that had like

1447
01:04:56,711 --> 01:04:59,380
a horrible trip on mushrooms.
They all had like psychological shit.

1448
01:04:59,381 --> 01:05:00,040
They were dealing with

1449
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,430
five bad problems.
I got sick.

1450
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:09,431
I was shitting myself.
Oh well that's possibly food poisoning.

1451
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:15,140
Most looks.
Bad trips I think are overdosing.

1452
01:05:15,141 --> 01:05:20,141
I think that's all it is.
There's an overdose of how much 

1453
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:20,141
mushrooms

1454
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:20,620
you should have based on how much you 
ate that day.

1455
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:21,820
How much.
I don't know.

1456
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:26,821
All the factors needs to be regulated 
because then it can be dispensed like 

1457
01:05:26,821 --> 01:05:28,150
synthetic I've,
but we're talking about,

1458
01:05:28,151 --> 01:05:33,151
um,
the whole idea behind the fact that 

1459
01:05:33,151 --> 01:05:34,240
these drugs,
like cocaine are illegal,

1460
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:36,850
is what keeps them from being impure.
Know everyone,

1461
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:38,470
cuts them up.
Everyone adds all this stuff to them.

1462
01:05:38,471 --> 01:05:41,110
You couldn't do that if it was sold by 
Coca Cola.

1463
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,090
Coco was selling cocaine.
Sure you know,

1464
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:43,620
you,
you,

1465
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,510
you would have to have the ingredients 
listed right there on it.

1466
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:48,120
You would know exactly what it was.
You,

1467
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,870
they would have to sell your actual 
cocaine,

1468
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:52,720
you know,
but when you buying it from some fucking

1469
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:53,770
kid at a rave,
you,

1470
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,110
he's calling it Mtma.
Hope he's right.

1471
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,670
You don't know.
You're taking a chance.

1472
01:05:57,671 --> 01:05:59,090
You want to party,
you want to have a good time.

1473
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:01,830
Who knows what the fuck it is.
It's like what your idea is,

1474
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,700
was talking about with the cocaine the 
other day.

1475
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,050
That's what I just said.
Oh,

1476
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,700
Jesus Christ.
You don't even listening.

1477
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,940
That's what we were actually saying.
That's the subject we were talking,

1478
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:11,260
dude,
if I did,

1479
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:14,560
if I had a time machine,
Rogan and I could go back in time,

1480
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:19,890
one of my stops on the way back to the 
crucifixion would be to fucking pick up 

1481
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:25,140
a cocaine laden bottle of Coca Cola.
Haven't you always wondered what that 

1482
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,220
was like to drink at cocaine?
Cocaine,

1483
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,770
coke,
do it.

1484
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,080
It's got to be.
Well,

1485
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:32,620
when we say cocaine,
this is also.

1486
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:35,050
We talked about this in the podcast or 
stayed the coca leaf.

1487
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:37,210
The chewing of the coca leaf has a very 
complete.

1488
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,380
It's a very different reaction than I'm 
eating and by the way,

1489
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,030
a coca leaves are still in Coca Cola.

1490
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,970
A lot of people don't know,
but yeah,

1491
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:47,410
you,
they still important.

1492
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,440
Even though cocoa leaves are illegal,
they still import coca leaves to using 

1493
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,340
Coca Cola.
I might be talking on my end.

1494
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:56,530
I think they changed the formula for 
that for a long time ago.

1495
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,510
I don't know.
Is that when they showed it was like the

1496
01:06:58,511 --> 01:07:00,230
20th or something like that?
Yeah.

1497
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:00,910
No,
no.

1498
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:02,350
I think it was like a long,
long time ago.

1499
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,450
Not sure about that.
Uh,

1500
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,990
I'm not sure about that,
but anyway,

1501
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:11,590
the point is the coca leaf,
which,

1502
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:12,460
which they,
they,

1503
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:13,030
you know,
they had,

1504
01:07:13,031 --> 01:07:14,710
that was,
that was an ingredient,

1505
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:19,920
right,
but were they using cocaine as an 

1506
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,350
ingredient or was it just the coca 
leaves?

1507
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:21,480
I don't know.
I mean,

1508
01:07:21,481 --> 01:07:24,220
it wasn't sherlock holmes addicted to 
cocaine and those books.

1509
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:26,380
I think it was a lot of guys.
I thought it was morphine.

1510
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,280
It wasn't a morphine.
I can't remember.

1511
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:28,880
Is that,
um,

1512
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:34,140
wider,
wider up used to go to the morphine 

1513
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:34,140
probably people.
Well,

1514
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:37,231
yeah,
and they had opium dens and I think 

1515
01:07:37,231 --> 01:07:39,630
Freud was really into coke.
I think there were like blasting 

1516
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:39,960
themselves with coke everywhere and I 
was totally illegal,

1517
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:42,760
like no one,
it wasn't regulated back then.

1518
01:07:42,761 --> 01:07:43,780
As far as I know.
I,

1519
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:46,510
I think you could at least get 
prescriptions for it.

1520
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:51,511
I've seen like cool all bought.
I mean if it's in fucking coke fits in 

1521
01:07:51,511 --> 01:07:52,120
Coca Cola,
it's illegal.

1522
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,000
Yeah,
there is actual legal people.

1523
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:58,570
Must've been a noxious back then.
Everyone's on coke.

1524
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:03,571
It must've been the worst.
Cocacola actually does have a legal 

1525
01:08:03,571 --> 01:08:05,890
importation of the coca leaf.
I'm still.

1526
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,540
Yes,
coca,

1527
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:08,900
coca,
Coca Cola.

1528
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:13,901
The coke formula is one of the most 
closely guarded corporate secrets in 

1529
01:08:13,901 --> 01:08:15,890
America.
The company can seeds that using a d,

1530
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:21,070
cocaine,
ised flavor essence in the coca leaves 

1531
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:24,770
is one of the few coke ingredients that 
company will publicly acknowledged.

1532
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:29,510
So they are using an actual abstract of 
the coca leaf that has no cocaine in it.

1533
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,870
So I was right.
Yeah,

1534
01:08:30,871 --> 01:08:33,150
I know that cocaine going.
They're extracting.

1535
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:34,820
Dude,
who do

1536
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:39,550
I saw goes to Elton John's.
All the cocaine in the world.

1537
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:45,450
You imagine if Coca Cola turned out to 
be the number one dealer and on Earth if

1538
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:50,930
they're d extracting cocaine from.
Where's it going?

1539
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:52,570
Done right away.
We don't even need it.

1540
01:08:52,571 --> 01:08:55,290
Even though the Chileans forget that 
money.

1541
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:58,420
Okay,
we're here to sell kids sugary shit that

1542
01:08:58,421 --> 01:08:59,450
makes your teeth rot out.

1543
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,980
We're not here to kill anybody and the 
guys actually Dr Pepper the whole time.

1544
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,160
He's like scarface,
character of the Coca Cola company.

1545
01:09:08,161 --> 01:09:11,160
All you need to know about the weather 
or not,

1546
01:09:11,161 --> 01:09:16,161
they would make money off of things like
that is who's making money off 

1547
01:09:16,161 --> 01:09:17,670
cigarettes?
Cigarettes are fucking for sure.

1548
01:09:17,671 --> 01:09:18,420
Killing,
yeah,

1549
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:22,260
like almost a half a million people a 
year in this country alone.

1550
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:27,930
Our ideas about intoxication are so 
bizarre and baffling that somehow or 

1551
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:32,061
another we think that they are 
protecting us from something that 

1552
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:35,481
perturbs our state of consciousness that
makes us think about things in a 

1553
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:36,360
completely different way and possibly 
even hallucinate,

1554
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:41,040
but some weird surge that you get 
because of an almost immediate addiction

1555
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:46,041
that you've acquired to some stupid 
fucking burning plant that's soaked in 

1556
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,750
chemicals.
No one even discusses it.

1557
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,790
It never comes up.
Not at all.

1558
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,890
No campaigns ever bring it up.
No one ever promised.

1559
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,690
People are promising bases on the moon.
Newt Gingrich got desperate and plump,

1560
01:09:57,691 --> 01:10:00,990
promised a base on the moon.
By the time he had a second term,

1561
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,930
he threw a hail Mary.
It's like based on the mood.

1562
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:08,990
No one ever says,
we need to make cigarettes illegal and 

1563
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:10,050
save.
Our friends were dying a horrible death,

1564
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:15,410
addicted to a terrible chemical that's 
sick company as profiting off,

1565
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:20,900
and we need to really change the way we 
look to change the way we look at this 

1566
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,990
terrible,
terrible scourge in America.

1567
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:22,830
No one,
not,

1568
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:25,860
not a single politician would ever make 
that speech and meanwhile they did.

1569
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,870
They'd want a dead in the fucking hotel 
room somewhere,

1570
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:32,910
but meanwhile,
if any anyone running for president 

1571
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:35,731
said,
I think that psilocybin makes you 

1572
01:10:36,221 --> 01:10:41,221
connect with the universe and it makes 
you love the people around you more and 

1573
01:10:41,221 --> 01:10:44,911
it gives you more of an experience of a 
full life and reminds you of how small 

1574
01:10:44,911 --> 01:10:46,930
you are in relation to everything out so
you can't really God on it.

1575
01:10:46,931 --> 01:10:50,680
So I don't think it should be illegal if
somebody said that.

1576
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,420
If a president said that right now,
like Santorum said that,

1577
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:56,490
or somebody said that they would never 
get elected.

1578
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:57,970
Did you say that?
But I don't.

1579
01:10:57,971 --> 01:10:59,510
I don't agree.
Not only will.

1580
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:04,620
The only way they would never get 
elected is if they would never get 

1581
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:04,620
elected anyway because elections aren't 
real.

1582
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,130
But could they change the public's 
consciousness?

1583
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:08,920
Absolutely depressed.
But if you got an eloquent guy,

1584
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:11,890
well the evidence John Hopkins,
the recent John Hopkins University,

1585
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,520
sure it would work a 20 year period of 
time.

1586
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:19,521
All these people that took mushrooms 
just once at a direct change in their 

1587
01:11:19,521 --> 01:11:20,030
personality and improvement of their 
personality,

1588
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,600
illegal.
Of course it shouldn't be illegal,

1589
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:26,601
but I think that if someone was eloquent
and someone made sense in all other 

1590
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:30,111
areas,
if someone was a bright person and they 

1591
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:32,220
can prove it with data and prove it in 
an articulate and eloquent manner,

1592
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:35,040
where it was compelling were what they 
were telling you was that,

1593
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,360
here's what's going on.
Okay,

1594
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:41,540
I know you're all associating drugs with
being a negative thing and the reason 

1595
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:41,610
for that.

1596
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,700
It's intelligent to do so.
Most drugs and many,

1597
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:47,610
many drugs can be very negative on your 
life.

1598
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:52,870
However,
we've been sold a bill of goods on 

1599
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,420
certain drugs and certain drugs are 
actually good for you.

1600
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:59,600
Not only are they good for you,
they may be the whole reason we evolved 

1601
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,891
from fucking monkeys in the first place,
but we been lied to and the companies 

1602
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:08,130
that keep us in order right now would 
like to keep everything the way it is.

1603
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:11,010
The reason being is they're profiting 
off things being illegal.

1604
01:12:11,011 --> 01:12:15,600
There's a lot of profit on drugs being 
illegal that are illegal currently.

1605
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:20,750
It's not as simple as they would just 
sell them to and then they would make 

1606
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,660
the money.
Why wouldn't they make it legal?

1607
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:27,010
There is money to be made that will not 
be available once psychedelic drugs or 

1608
01:12:27,241 --> 01:12:32,241
illegal.
There's a lot of things that are for 

1609
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:32,370
sale,
especially pharmaceutical drugs.

1610
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:37,580
A huge amount that just making marijuana
legal would just squash the market for a

1611
01:12:38,221 --> 01:12:43,221
good percentage of pain relief and 
Glaucoma medication reduces interocular 

1612
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:47,820
pressure.
P people on aids who have aids,

1613
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:48,280
who,
uh,

1614
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:53,550
can eat,
people on chemotherapy that have a hard 

1615
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:56,331
time eating all of that.
There's so many drugs that are 

1616
01:12:56,331 --> 01:12:57,570
prescribed for various elements that 
literally would be out of business.

1617
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:58,160
So and,
and,

1618
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:01,490
and so consider this,
take it to the human level.

1619
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:06,610
This is where it gets fucked up.
We have access to certain mind states 

1620
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:11,390
where you can bring back authentic 
information.

1621
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:14,450
They can help your life and the life of 
the people around you.

1622
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:17,630
And there's a possibility that if enough
people were having these mind states,

1623
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:22,810
there might be an acceleration in 
technology and acceleration and science 

1624
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:26,381
and acceleration and philosophy,
but because we can't get these mind 

1625
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:27,740
states,
we can't get these mind states.

1626
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:30,740
Things are slow and weird and dumb right
now.

1627
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:34,040
And the reason we can't get it is so 
that people can make more money.

1628
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:34,510
Okay.
Well,

1629
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:36,940
let me play devil's advocate please.
First off,

1630
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:39,970
there's a lot of people that think that 
a lot of hippies are fucking mooches.

1631
01:13:39,971 --> 01:13:42,190
They mooch off the government,
they get welfare,

1632
01:13:42,191 --> 01:13:44,500
they get public aid,
they don't want to pull their share.

1633
01:13:44,501 --> 01:13:45,550
They don't want to pull their own 
weight.

1634
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:50,800
A lot of people think that these,
these experiences that you say that will

1635
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:51,880
benefit people,
they say,

1636
01:13:51,881 --> 01:13:52,990
well,
where's the evidence?

1637
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:57,430
Where's the evidence of anybody finding 
out anything worthwhile on,

1638
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,320
on psychedelics?
Terence Mckenna?

1639
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,240
That doesn't mean anything.
Francis Crick.

1640
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:06,270
Okay.
That's a rumor after he died that was 

1641
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:06,460
released as that.
He was a deathbed confession.

1642
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:12,560
No,
he was good friends with a brave new 

1643
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:12,560
world out as Huxley is friends with 
Huxley.

1644
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:12,560
Yeah,
no,

1645
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,130
it's true.
It's true if you were friends with not 

1646
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:17,130
saying,
but okay,

1647
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:17,560
that's true that he took it,
but it doesn't mean the.

1648
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,290
The,
the,

1649
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:18,910
the,
the,

1650
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:24,150
what the statement is,
is that he discovered the double helix 

1651
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:24,520
strand.
He figured it out while he was on Lsd.

1652
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,150
That's all anecdotal.
That's all deathbed confessions.

1653
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:29,380
He never said that anywhere.
There's no.

1654
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:32,800
It's not written anywhere.
So just in fairness,

1655
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:35,260
I don't think you can directly attribute
that to him.

1656
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:38,560
I've looked at the sources for that.
It's possible that he said that,

1657
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,730
but I don't think you can stay.
I can.

1658
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,510
I mean,
you're like in a court of law.

1659
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:47,200
I can't prove it,
but being friends with Aldous Huxley,

1660
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:52,460
a manual on his deathbed,
he had himself injected with like 750 

1661
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,820
micrograms of Lsd.
Being friends with that guy.

1662
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,600
That's like being friends with you.
You'll never haven't gotten stumped.

1663
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:57,770
No,
no,

1664
01:14:57,771 --> 01:14:58,150
no.
You're not.

1665
01:14:58,151 --> 01:14:59,830
You're misunderstanding me.
Yes.

1666
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:02,980
He probably did do LSD.
The question is,

1667
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:04,500
what did he get out of it?
How do you,

1668
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,070
how do you know?
He didn't just hallucinate.

1669
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:07,550
You know,
there's no evidence.

1670
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:11,590
There's no evidence that it helped them 
in any way.

1671
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:17,220
Do you know what I'm saying?
It's not like they pulled some nothing 

1672
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:17,220
on paper.
There's nothing you can be like.

1673
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:17,860
Look here.
There is one guy,

1674
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:19,150
Kerry,
Kary Mullis.

1675
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:24,200
I'm kary Mullis.
He was a Nobel prize winning chemist and

1676
01:15:24,431 --> 01:15:29,431
he said that LSD had helped him develop 
a polymers chain reaction that helps 

1677
01:15:29,431 --> 01:15:31,810
amplify,
amplify specific DNA sequences.

1678
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:34,030
And he figured that out while I was on 
acid.

1679
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,170
Well,
there's one.

1680
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:36,590
So there's one.
Can you.

1681
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:39,310
Can you read that again?
What he did here?

1682
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:44,311
Here's the full thing.
During a symposium held a for Albert 

1683
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:48,660
Hoffman,
Hoffman revealed that he was told by 

1684
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,791
Nobel prize winning chemist,
Kary Mullis that LSD had helped him 

1685
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:52,230
develop the Pala polymers.

1686
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:57,300
Pete hope I'm saying this right.
P O l y m e r a s e Dot polyamorous,

1687
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,800
polyamorous.
Anyway,

1688
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:04,830
Jamie,
action that helps amplify specific DNA 

1689
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:04,830
sequences.
What does that mean?

1690
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,410
I don't know.
I'm too stupid for that,

1691
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,730
but the,
um,

1692
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,990
the guy said,
I'm Kari Moss even admitted a.

1693
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,970
What if I had not taken lsd ever?
I would.

1694
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:15,440
I still have invented PCR.
That was the method.

1695
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:17,530
I don't know.
I doubt it.

1696
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,330
I seriously doubt that's what I'm 
saying,

1697
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:20,470
Bro.
That's what I'm saying.

1698
01:16:20,471 --> 01:16:25,471
There's a fucking group of people who've
got their fucking clause dug into the 

1699
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:29,380
force of evolution and they're trying to
hold it back.

1700
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:34,381
Okay.
But if all the people that have done 

1701
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:36,091
Lsd,
one fucking guy says he figured once 

1702
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,280
I've done lsd 100 times,
I have not learned any new or not the 

1703
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,240
best example,
but have you learned,

1704
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,930
have you learned something about 
yourself personally?

1705
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:47,060
Insight,
personal insight solution.

1706
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,180
Personally member.
What I'm doing though,

1707
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:54,200
I am playing devil's advocate.
I'm a republican with shiny shoes on 

1708
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,080
with black socks and you know,
I'm the guy who was telling you that if 

1709
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,820
you buy drugs you support terrorism.
Yeah.

1710
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,110
No,
no,

1711
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,660
no.
You told me one guy,

1712
01:17:01,661 --> 01:17:06,661
one guy says he invented a PCR method,
which you don't even understand why I 

1713
01:17:06,661 --> 01:17:06,850
was on LSD.
Okay.

1714
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:11,970
Okay.
So we should have lsd legal because guy 

1715
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,880
in d we should have all psychedelics 
mushrooms as well.

1716
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,830
Right.
But when you start throwing it around.

1717
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:18,020
What about the arts?
Devil's advocate.

1718
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:19,140
I know.
No,

1719
01:17:19,141 --> 01:17:20,450
I don't.
I'm not even seeing you now.

1720
01:17:20,451 --> 01:17:22,440
I'm just seeing what about,
uh,

1721
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:26,420
what about the fucking art man?
What a man does that not count?

1722
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:29,200
What,
what good lsd art.

1723
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:33,650
Do you know of?
What's the best to Jimi Hendrix glow.

1724
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:34,040
Okay.

1725
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,980
Jimmy Hendrix is more heroin,
wasn't even heroin and cocaine,

1726
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,050
wasn't he?
Wasn't he a heroin guy?

1727
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:43,100
Purple Haze.
That's purple haze.

1728
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:48,160
Isn't that pot dude?
Jimi Hendrix was so into fucking LSD or 

1729
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:48,200
purple haze.
Is that potter?

1730
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:51,670
Is that it is now purple haze was 
asking.

1731
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,700
Well,
I'm sure he did ask it.

1732
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:58,720
Don't get me wrong,
but do you think that that's why he was 

1733
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:58,720
so good?
I mean,

1734
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,690
wasn't he like really good when he was a
bad ass?

1735
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:02,050
Fucking gets helped him.
But again,

1736
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:08,250
I know you're playing devil's advocate,
but I'm being devil's advocate is the 

1737
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,170
same thing as being friends with a 
pedophile.

1738
01:18:09,171 --> 01:18:10,430
I mean,
you don't want to be devil's advocate.

1739
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:15,431
It's the worst force in the universe and
always represents everything evil and 

1740
01:18:15,431 --> 01:18:15,431
bad.
No,

1741
01:18:15,431 --> 01:18:20,160
I take the side of an argument that 
doesn't currently exist with this table 

1742
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:20,330
because I'm sure somebody is screaming 
it out on twitter,

1743
01:18:20,331 --> 01:18:20,480
right?

1744
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,090
Devil's advocate is I,
you know,

1745
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:26,040
I think for sure psychedelics can,
uh,

1746
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:31,210
can help people.
But what I think it is is I think 

1747
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:34,180
essentially we have access to super 
computers and there's no instruction 

1748
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:38,771
manuals laying around and there's no 
teachers to teach her how to use these 

1749
01:18:38,771 --> 01:18:42,281
things.
So a lot of people are getting great 

1750
01:18:42,281 --> 01:18:44,051
results and they're all scattered and 
all over the poor and they're mixed in 

1751
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:45,130
with psychosis and bad trips and a lot 
of fucking freaky,

1752
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:50,200
freaky things that have happened to 
people and they've taken the wrong shit 

1753
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:50,200
and they got ahold of a fake computer.
You know,

1754
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:54,791
there's a lot of people that are in that
is because there's lack of regulation 

1755
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:58,691
because there's a lack of understanding 
because there's a lack of appreciation 

1756
01:18:58,691 --> 01:19:01,400
for the true effects as human beings.
It is absolutely preposterous.

1757
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:04,220
It's so many people will tell you this,
Carrie,

1758
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:09,221
most guy or whether Francis Crick was 
telling you the truth or whether you're 

1759
01:19:09,221 --> 01:19:12,641
telling me the truth or I'm telling you 
the truth or any of us that have had 

1760
01:19:12,641 --> 01:19:12,770
really positive experiences.

1761
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:18,160
There's there's way too many people that
are saying that folks can benefit from 

1762
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:18,710
it,
for it to stay illegal.

1763
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:23,360
The people that are stopping it,
they don't make any more sense than us.

1764
01:19:23,361 --> 01:19:25,360
It's not like they're.
They're.

1765
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:30,370
They're really wise and cautious and 
noble and loving overlords that want to 

1766
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:35,080
protect you from your own folly.
That is not what's going on because they

1767
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:37,100
they're.
They're talking and ignorant statements.

1768
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,570
Medically.
It's ignorance.

1769
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,550
There's no evidence to back up what 
they're saying.

1770
01:19:40,551 --> 01:19:44,330
There's no reason that it makes sense 
and then when you start throwing numbers

1771
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:49,331
at their face like the,
the amount of nonviolent drug offenders 

1772
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:50,840
that are in jail and how preposterous it
is that our society exists where a bunch

1773
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:55,841
of people were doing what they want to 
do that doesn't hurt anybody else and 

1774
01:19:55,841 --> 01:19:55,841
someone decides to lock them in a cage 
for it.

1775
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:57,980
Well,
that person is who's doing more harm.

1776
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:03,190
The guy was smoking pot,
or the person who locked him in a 

1777
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:05,411
fucking cage destroys their life and 
does it because it's written on paper 

1778
01:20:05,411 --> 01:20:05,770
somewhere that that's okay.
Well,

1779
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,160
that guy,
a destructive.

1780
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:08,580
The law

1781
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:11,640
becomes a destructive force in society,
not the drug.

1782
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,070
When you say drugs,
kill people and drugs,

1783
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:17,610
drugs are responsible for a million 
people in jail right now.

1784
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,860
That's why I don't do drugs.
You won't get locked up.

1785
01:20:19,861 --> 01:20:20,360
No,
no,

1786
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:20,700
no,
no.

1787
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:25,790
Don't put people in cages because they 
don't agree with you because they like 

1788
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:26,730
something.
They like it so much.

1789
01:20:26,731 --> 01:20:31,731
They're willing to risk freedom because 
they found themselves in some sort of a 

1790
01:20:31,731 --> 01:20:35,091
situation when they're in an environment
that they have no control over 

1791
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:35,091
whatsoever.
They were born into this,

1792
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:37,590
they didn't ask to be dropped into this 
preposterous,

1793
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:40,080
illogical,
nonsensical,

1794
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:43,170
ridiculously lopsided and corrupt 
society,

1795
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:48,290
and you just accept them to comply.
You just expect them to comply with 

1796
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:53,181
these stupid fucking things that are 
written down on paper that everybody 

1797
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:53,181
knows.
Makes no sense.

1798
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:53,181
Well,
that's.

1799
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,340
That's the problem.
The laws are the problem.

1800
01:20:56,430 --> 01:21:00,420
The laws are destructive.
The laws are anti evolutionary.

1801
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:04,470
The laws are they're anti enlightenment.
That's the problem.

1802
01:21:04,471 --> 01:21:05,960
It's not the drug.
It's not pot.

1803
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:08,400
It's not mushrooms.
It's the laws against pot and mushrooms.

1804
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,250
Those are a devastating aspect of our 
society.

1805
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,810
Those are not the fucking drugs you 
dummies missed it.

1806
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:17,860
You missed the whole thing.
You're not protecting anybody.

1807
01:21:17,861 --> 01:21:19,860
You fucks and anybody that hasn't done 
drugs,

1808
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:23,160
if you haven't done mushrooms,
fucking for sure you shouldn't be a cop.

1809
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:24,300
No Way,
man.

1810
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:29,420
You're going to be in position of power 
with a gun and making decisions and 

1811
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:30,120
you've never done any mushrooms at all.
You've never had any.

1812
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:33,600
Look at yourself through the eyes of 
alien intelligence.

1813
01:21:33,601 --> 01:21:38,601
You've never had some objective outside 
the body experience analyzing all this 

1814
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:41,370
shitty aspects of your own life.
How the fuck are you growing?

1815
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:46,371
How are you developing?
Are you crawling along and one little 

1816
01:21:46,371 --> 01:21:49,881
stumble after another and one little 
apology after another and one little 

1817
01:21:49,881 --> 01:21:51,360
breakup and make up cycle after another.

1818
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,360
After another way,
you scream insults at each other and 

1819
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:56,360
then so I'm sorry,
baby will never happen again.

1820
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:00,411
Have learned Milosevic.
Is that what you're learning about 

1821
01:22:00,411 --> 01:22:00,411
yourself from your,
your,

1822
01:22:00,411 --> 01:22:00,411
your Shitty,
lonely nights,

1823
01:22:00,411 --> 01:22:02,550
eating TV dinners,
hoping that your is going to return your

1824
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:07,551
pager or your text message rather so you
can paint her pastors was go back in 

1825
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:09,990
time.
But that's what I'm saying,

1826
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,310
you know,
getting someone to respond to you,

1827
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:12,700
getting somebody you know because you,
you,

1828
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:15,010
you realized that being a cunt,
you know,

1829
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,070
makes people not like you anymore.
So that's how you grow up,

1830
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:22,290
you know,
instead of like seeing it in one big 

1831
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:22,290
burst,
all leaders,

1832
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:23,040
all cops,
all teachers,

1833
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:28,490
all of them should have a psychedelic 
experience or they don't know what the 

1834
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:28,980
fuck they're talking about as a grown 
adult.

1835
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:30,630
If you haven't had a psychedelic 
experience,

1836
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:33,030
I look at you like you're some sort of 
an infant.

1837
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:38,720
You do.
Y'All look at you like your infant 

1838
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,761
toddler.
It's like I look at you like form 

1839
01:22:40,761 --> 01:22:40,761
illiterates.
Yeah,

1840
01:22:40,761 --> 01:22:41,820
it is.
It is like a form of like awareness,

1841
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:42,930
illiteracy.
Yeah.

1842
01:22:42,931 --> 01:22:43,610
That,
that's a,

1843
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:44,910
that's a great way to put it,
man.

1844
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:46,440
Awareness,
illiteracy.

1845
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:51,680
And it's sad that for some reason 
they're keeping as they're keeping so 

1846
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:51,920
many people illiterate,
but it's the practice.

1847
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:53,700
They are literate.
That's why they're doing it.

1848
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:58,701
They,
they are suffering under their own 

1849
01:22:58,701 --> 01:22:58,701
control and their own or most of them 
are.

1850
01:22:58,701 --> 01:23:01,560
I mean there's a Texas judge who just 
got arrested for fucking smoking weed.

1851
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,450
Oh really?
Somebody turned them in.

1852
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,600
The hotel think it's fucked up.
I think things are gonna Change,

1853
01:23:07,601 --> 01:23:12,601
man.
I mean they're lying saying this is the 

1854
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:12,601
third year letting the studies happen 
again.

1855
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:12,601
And if they're letting the studies 
happen again,

1856
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:13,930
there's some reason behind that.

1857
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:18,990
I mean the studies are happening.
They're allowing them to happen for the 

1858
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:21,811
first time and I think 30 or 40 years 
they're opening them up because 

1859
01:23:21,811 --> 01:23:23,350
government is dangerously suppressive,
dangerously suppressive.

1860
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:28,380
And not so much with civil liberties,
like a or rather with medical marijuana 

1861
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,770
and things along those lines.
But that's because it's democratic.

1862
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:31,840
When the ball goes in the opposite 
court,

1863
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:34,550
think about how much power has been 
given to the government under this,

1864
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,810
this democratic regime.
If we got another Bush Cheney,

1865
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:42,850
an office and they started cracking down
like John Ashcroft did on the medical 

1866
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,170
marijuana places and using losing 
blackwater to come in,

1867
01:23:44,171 --> 01:23:49,171
mercenaries will fucking machine guns on
their hips and taking all the pot and 

1868
01:23:49,171 --> 01:23:49,600
money away.
If that shit starts happening again,

1869
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,680
think about how much power Obama has 
given the government.

1870
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:54,740
Its ridiculous.
It's,

1871
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:57,520
it's,
it's really disgusting and preposterous.

1872
01:23:57,730 --> 01:23:59,020
I mean,
if you look at the Huffington,

1873
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:04,050
Huffington Post,
there's an article by this guy named 

1874
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:04,050
Jim,
Jim Garrison,

1875
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:08,860
and it's martial law by executive order 
not to be confused with Jim Garrison 

1876
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,570
that thought that Lee Harvey Oswald 
didn't kill Kennedy.

1877
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:12,610
You remember that guy?
The prosecutor.

1878
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:13,800
Anyway,
um,

1879
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:14,810
this,
uh,

1880
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:19,920
Obama,
he passed the National Defense 

1881
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:19,920
Organization,
uh,

1882
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:23,960
the NDA,
the new executive order called um,

1883
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:25,210
the,
uh,

1884
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:29,050
national defense resources preparedness,
executive order.

1885
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:34,550
And it does the country as a whole,
what the 2012 national defense 

1886
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:35,980
authorization act to the constitution in
particular,

1887
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:40,750
completely eviscerate any due process or
judicial oversight for any action by the

1888
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:43,420
government deemed in the interest of 
national security.

1889
01:24:43,421 --> 01:24:45,220
So they can just say something's 
national security.

1890
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,070
Essentially we're under martial law like
they can just say,

1891
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,320
and it's up to the government now,
all the,

1892
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:52,420
the,
the checks and balances that were put in

1893
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:55,300
place by the constitution to ensure that
there would be no corruption.

1894
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:59,230
There would be no ultimate power 
corrupting ultimately.

1895
01:24:59,260 --> 01:24:59,790
Well,
they,

1896
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,200
they've removed all that shit and you 
know,

1897
01:25:02,201 --> 01:25:03,340
right now everybody's like,
look,

1898
01:25:03,341 --> 01:25:05,140
but you're fine.
No one's no one's dying.

1899
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,190
No,
nothing's happening.

1900
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:11,640
The people that you say yes to today may
not be the people you say yes to 10 

1901
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,300
years from now or 20 years from now and 
these laws are crazy.

1902
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:16,990
These laws are that we might as well be 
living in fucking North Korea and that's

1903
01:25:16,991 --> 01:25:19,360
not ridiculous.
That's not an exaggeration.

1904
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:23,110
These are unconstitutional laws and 
they're not going to stop.

1905
01:25:23,111 --> 01:25:28,111
Now.
They're going to go more and more and 

1906
01:25:28,111 --> 01:25:28,780
more and more control until ultimately 
the government,

1907
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:31,750
which is by the way a approved the idea 
of sending drones.

1908
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:34,600
They're going to within the bike,
I think it was 12,

1909
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:37,180
20,
they're going to have a 2020 rather.

1910
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:39,430
They're going to have 30,000
drones in the sky,

1911
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:41,260
but North America.
Awesome.

1912
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:43,510
Come up constantly watching everything 
you do.

1913
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:44,110
Well.
Did you.

1914
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:47,500
Have you seen that youtube video of this
swarms of quadcopters?

1915
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,790
Have you seen that?
No.

1916
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:50,860
Dude,
look that at Google Quadra.

1917
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:51,920
Pull it up,
right?

1918
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:54,320
Holy Shit Man.
This is it.

1919
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:57,400
So there are these things called quadra 
copters that they're working on that are

1920
01:25:57,401 --> 01:26:00,010
just like exactly like the toys that you
see,

1921
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:02,950
but much smaller.
These fucking things man,

1922
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:03,830
they can like

1923
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:09,040
they move information.
It says video of them flying 

1924
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,220
information.
Just this swarm of tiny little nano or a

1925
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:15,280
tiny quadra copters they can like they 
give like turned sideways to go through 

1926
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,050
windows.
They're like,

1927
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:18,030
they can go anywhere man.
So and.

1928
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:21,660
But the scary thing that I never 
considered was that they can fucking fly

1929
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:26,670
information.
That's where it gets weird when you 

1930
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:29,261
imagine like just seeing like a swarm of
these things descending around your 

1931
01:26:29,261 --> 01:26:31,250
house or fluids checking you out on the 
street.

1932
01:26:31,251 --> 01:26:36,251
You're just walking.
We're just walking down the street and 

1933
01:26:36,251 --> 01:26:38,321
they come and like buzzing.
Do a quick facial scan to get your 

1934
01:26:38,321 --> 01:26:41,711
fucking face.
Match it up with like whatever 

1935
01:26:41,711 --> 01:26:41,711
facebook's doing,
Bang,

1936
01:26:41,711 --> 01:26:43,750
you know,
like.

1937
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:46,220
So yeah.
So privacy is a,

1938
01:26:46,221 --> 01:26:46,600
um,

1939
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:48,490
it's an escaping thing.
It's on its way out.

1940
01:26:48,491 --> 01:26:53,491
But the problem is the government,
these consultant running things are 

1941
01:26:53,491 --> 01:26:53,491
gonna have so much more power than the 
average citizen.

1942
01:26:53,491 --> 01:26:58,471
We're going to be under the rule of an 
oppressive government that has the law 

1943
01:26:58,471 --> 01:26:59,800
on their side because they changed all 
the fuck on paper.

1944
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:04,920
They changed all the stupid shit that's 
written down that allows them to do 

1945
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,501
cunty things.
They changed it all and they put it all 

1946
01:27:07,501 --> 01:27:09,871
in their defense.
And essentially what they did is the 

1947
01:27:09,871 --> 01:27:10,330
United States is now under martial law,
but there's no emergency,

1948
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:15,510
no emergency.
It doesn't have to have a national 

1949
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:15,510
emergency.
Did just be under martial law.

1950
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:17,230
Now we're just under martial law.
Why?

1951
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,630
Why is that?
What the fuck is going on?

1952
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:22,210
Part of it has got to be because they're
losing control.

1953
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:25,300
That's got to be part of it.
They feel like the Internet and all this

1954
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:27,530
anonymous shit and the hackers and 
occupied.

1955
01:27:27,531 --> 01:27:28,930
It's like,
what is this?

1956
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,690
Spell it out for him.
Tell him.

1957
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,150
I think it's q u,
a d,

1958
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,640
r a copter.
That's what it is.

1959
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,260
Quadra Copter,
swarm.

1960
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:42,740
Maybe someone will tweet it.
Someone tweeted it to me.

1961
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:45,020
It freaked me out for a week.
I showed it to.

1962
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:48,410
I showed it to Eddie Bravo at the UFC 
and his face went white.

1963
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:50,150
He just was like,
what the fuck?

1964
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,860
Swarm of Nana quadros.
That's it.

1965
01:27:52,861 --> 01:27:55,340
It's Nano.
Quad raters.

1966
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:56,140
Yeah.
There we go.

1967
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,550
Oh Shit.
Look at that.

1968
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:00,820
Just watch it gets better.
That's just one of these fucking things.

1969
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:01,720
Get Ready,
man.

1970
01:28:01,721 --> 01:28:03,730
Those things are probably going to eat 
your baby one day.

1971
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:07,660
Ooh.
That sound.

1972
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:10,420
When you hear that sound,
you know you're about to get busted.

1973
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:17,740
Whoa.

1974
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,920
They just fly around and maneuver.

1975
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:20,800
Okay.

1976
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:24,150
I'm surprised you haven't seen these 
vehicles can fly as a formation.

1977
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:30,250
Oh my God.
This is terrifying.

1978
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,060
It's gonna sound like Nascar all over 
the world.

1979
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:36,920
We're living in the future.
This is really fun.

1980
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,070
That's awesome.
This is really nuts.

1981
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:42,220
Yeah.

1982
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:50,280
This is a method to transition between 
formations in three d

1983
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:59,020
folks.
You have to see this because what you 

1984
01:28:59,020 --> 01:28:59,410
will,
what you're not seeing is these guys are

1985
01:28:59,411 --> 01:29:04,411
moving in perfect geometrical.
They move in these formations and 

1986
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:05,140
they're showing it from overhead and 
it's.

1987
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:08,610
It's amazing.
Their precision is incredible.

1988
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,830
This is terrifying.
By the way.

1989
01:29:10,831 --> 01:29:13,580
This is only like version one.
You know,

1990
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,010
this is like the first iphone gets 
smaller and smaller.

1991
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:22,280
This is incredible.
I wonder how long they can stay in the 

1992
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:22,280
air for.
Oh my God,

1993
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:22,320
look at that.
They're moving in a figure eight,

1994
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:23,440
a perfect figure.
Eight.

1995
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:26,940
Oh my God.
This is spectacular.

1996
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:29,040
This is really scary

1997
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,330
stuff.
Scary Shit,

1998
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:31,620
man.
Now look at them building.

1999
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:35,160
Look up quadra copter building a 
structure.

2000
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:37,530
Build Shit,
man.

2001
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:41,220
They can actually pick shit up and start
gluing it built.

2002
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,860
They can actually build structures.
That's amazing.

2003
01:29:43,861 --> 01:29:45,660
That's what Kurzweil was talking about,
man,

2004
01:29:45,661 --> 01:29:50,661
because when those things shrink down 
enough so that they can like imagine 

2005
01:29:50,661 --> 01:29:53,901
like just a pile of fucking legos and a 
shitload of those fucking things and 

2006
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:57,030
they could actually form matter.
That's where it gets really cool.

2007
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:02,940
Think about that forming matter.
That's where it gets weird when you've 

2008
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:06,891
got a computer directing swarms of those
things to construct architecture that 

2009
01:30:07,261 --> 01:30:09,000
humans couldn't even make,
you know,

2010
01:30:09,001 --> 01:30:14,001
like weird fucking geometries.
That can only happen when a computers 

2011
01:30:14,001 --> 01:30:15,810
and control the building process.
If it ever gets to that point,

2012
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,820
it might be the just start fucking 
killing people.

2013
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,620
Well,
that's funny thing man.

2014
01:30:19,621 --> 01:30:21,620
People always say that about computers 
where they're like,

2015
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:23,700
they're just going to kill us,
but I guess it's.

2016
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:25,040
I don't think it's going to be the 
computers.

2017
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:30,041
It would be the things controlling them.
Like people automatically assume when 

2018
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:31,620
the machine inevitably wakes up,
it's,

2019
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:33,480
it's gonna want to get,
I want to kill us,

2020
01:30:33,481 --> 01:30:33,780
but

2021
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,290
plague,
you know,

2022
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:40,300
if it looked at the environment it's 
living in and realize that there's 

2023
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,410
massive overpopulating entity that's 
spilling all.

2024
01:30:41,411 --> 01:30:46,411
It's bullshit into the sea and eating 
all the fucking animals that live in it 

2025
01:30:46,411 --> 01:30:47,140
and then they will just calculate how 
long can this last?

2026
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:48,250
Well,
it can't at this rate,

2027
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:50,670
so they'll just start eating the country
now.

2028
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,070
Man.
Fucking work.

2029
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:54,250
It'd be great.
Maybe we would eliminate.

2030
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:55,900
No,
I don't even.

2031
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:59,740
I don't people out of the sky just 
conscious gets sucked out of the sky.

2032
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:02,350
I get they're watching and watching 
everything.

2033
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:07,380
That's a little bit that machines are 
watching everything and when you litter 

2034
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:07,600
and when you're a shithead and when you 
beat,

2035
01:31:07,601 --> 01:31:10,180
your wife just gets sucked out of.
Guy Won't get down voted.

2036
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:12,280
Yeah.
You get a certain number of negatives.

2037
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:17,360
Downvotes like on Reddit,
if you get as a person has certain 

2038
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,290
number they carry you in this phase,
rub points.

2039
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,450
If you get blocked by a certain amount 
of people,

2040
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:24,080
just them building this thing.
Oh my God,

2041
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:26,670
crazy fucking thing.
Well,

2042
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:31,671
this,
the thing that they're building is this 

2043
01:31:31,671 --> 01:31:32,490
enormous like lego building that's 
really cool looking.

2044
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,250
That was blocks have glue on them or 
something,

2045
01:31:35,251 --> 01:31:40,251
and by the way,
this is just the beginning of that shit 

2046
01:31:40,251 --> 01:31:40,950
that's going to be.
That didn't exist 20 years ago.

2047
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:43,020
There was no no hope of that.
Twenty years ago,

2048
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:45,750
20 years from now.
What do check this out?

2049
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,180
If you ever seen,
if you've ever seen the video of that,

2050
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,150
there a machine that you can take to the
desert that someone made.

2051
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:54,990
It's solar powered because there's so 
much energy and it focuses the energy of

2052
01:31:54,991 --> 01:31:58,890
the sun and the desert to turn sand into
blocks.

2053
01:31:59,050 --> 01:31:59,950
It can burn

2054
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,550
sanding blocks,
so now imagine this combined,

2055
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:08,760
those fucking things with solar panels 
and a thing that can infinitely can use 

2056
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,690
an infinite amount of sand in the desert
to make blocks.

2057
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:15,870
Those things could fly out in the 
fucking desert and make infinitely 

2058
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:17,260
gigantic structures with endless fucking
energy.

2059
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:22,440
Just the combination of those two 
technologies at the rudimentary level 

2060
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:22,600
that they're at now,
if we can fucking figure out how to make

2061
01:32:22,601 --> 01:32:25,090
them solar power.
Solar is really interesting.

2062
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:28,030
It's like it's kind of hit a wall and a 
lot of ways.

2063
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,620
So what are you,
what are you doing?

2064
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:34,760
I googled a solar power sandbox and it 
came up with minecraft.

2065
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:40,460
Solar power is not really strong enough 
for a lot of shit right now for most 

2066
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:43,981
people.
Can't like have all their electricity 

2067
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:43,981
through solar power.
You use like a lot of people use.

2068
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:48,781
Like I have a friend that uses a 
combination of solar and wind and he 

2069
01:32:48,781 --> 01:32:48,781
actually developed enough from the.

2070
01:32:48,781 --> 01:32:50,470
He lives in Oregon.
He develops enough from nothing.

2071
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:55,070
He actually sells it back to the grid,
which I don't know.

2072
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,350
Strange.
How do you do that?

2073
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:57,390
I don't understand it.
Yeah,

2074
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,900
I don't get it.
How do you do what?

2075
01:32:58,901 --> 01:33:01,810
Sell Electricity back.
They pay him.

2076
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,840
Yeah.
There's a meter on it that regulates it 

2077
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,941
going in.
But you could also have it fitted so it 

2078
01:33:08,941 --> 01:33:08,941
regulates how much is going on here.
So he adds.

2079
01:33:08,941 --> 01:33:13,230
So the local power plant or whatever is 
supplying them power doesn't have to 

2080
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:13,330
work as hard.
That's so fucking weird,

2081
01:33:13,331 --> 01:33:14,020
man.
Crazy.

2082
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:16,100
You can turn wind into money.
Well,

2083
01:33:16,101 --> 01:33:21,101
if you ever been.
There's certain parts of California 

2084
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:21,101
where we,
uh,

2085
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:21,610
we have filmed some fear factors where 
they have these um,

2086
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:26,470
these huge,
like they look like a farm of these wind

2087
01:33:26,471 --> 01:33:27,610
things.
These windmills,

2088
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:32,611
like a windmill farm and there's a 
shitload of them just sitting up on a 

2089
01:33:32,611 --> 01:33:33,340
hill and they power the area.

2090
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,590
I don't mind it.
I don't know how much they power,

2091
01:33:35,591 --> 01:33:37,060
how many structures,
how many buildings.

2092
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:42,480
But it's enough that the,
a lot of shit is getting powered by the 

2093
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,300
wind.
It's really a trip.

2094
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:45,060
Well,
it's really windy out there too,

2095
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:50,070
so it's a smart thing to do like even as
you come out here towards Pasadena and 

2096
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:54,241
you head up the 2:10
and when you go through that whole 

2097
01:33:54,241 --> 01:33:54,760
mountain ipass ii area where it's like 
you lose your cell phone signal,

2098
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:57,790
fucking beautiful out there.
Windy as fuck.

2099
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,890
A lot of people have like real wind 
problems.

2100
01:33:59,891 --> 01:34:03,250
Even out here,
like remember when they had a problem?

2101
01:34:03,251 --> 01:34:08,251
Really recently the wind knocked down a 
lot of power cables and Pastina guy 

2102
01:34:08,251 --> 01:34:09,850
because he got fucked by wind.
I got trapped here.

2103
01:34:09,851 --> 01:34:13,550
I couldn't even lead the place.
Fuck why wind from the was too bad.

2104
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:17,890
I like seriously the street out front 
here with trees flying down the street,

2105
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,920
things off,
flying off the roofs,

2106
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:23,850
like metal things and awnings and stayed
in.

2107
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:26,890
They couldn't get to.
My car was too scary,

2108
01:34:26,891 --> 01:34:28,180
man.
It was a death.

2109
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,370
It was deadly outside.
It was like being in a tornado.

2110
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,170
Wow.
No,

2111
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:33,460
it was no,
seriously.

2112
01:34:33,461 --> 01:34:34,650
It was really bad.
It.

2113
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:39,660
There's nothing like NATO.
Next time you go out in his back door 

2114
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:39,660
over here,
look at the billboard.

2115
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:44,341
That's billboard wishes ripping apart 
and it was like a super old billboard 

2116
01:34:44,341 --> 01:34:46,660
was shaking like this and things were 
just flying off of it.

2117
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:49,750
That's really powerful,
but it's nothing like a fucking tornado.

2118
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:50,580
There's,
uh,

2119
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:55,630
there's been tornadoes that were hit or 
hit cities in the middle of the night 

2120
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:57,800
and literally made the city disappear.
Especially towns,

2121
01:34:57,870 --> 01:34:59,600
small towns in the middle of nowhere.
You know,

2122
01:34:59,601 --> 01:35:04,601
what they say that the heat of cities 
actually prevents tornadoes since all 

2123
01:35:04,601 --> 01:35:07,940
the structure and the way it's the way 
it's built and the heat coming off of it

2124
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,530
apparently doesn't work in cities.

2125
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:12,590
Do you believe any of that weather 
control shit they talk about like,

2126
01:35:12,591 --> 01:35:14,760
um,
what's the name of like that,

2127
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:21,100
you know,
these Eddie Bravo on here for this 

2128
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:21,100
conversation.
Do you believe in that?

2129
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:24,861
Like they've been,
they've been trying to like actually 

2130
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:24,861
can.
I know they do it like in China,

2131
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:28,781
don't they?
Like they've been playing around trying 

2132
01:35:28,781 --> 01:35:30,491
to make it rain and like you can put 
certain particles into the air that 

2133
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:32,260
actually makes it rain.
Um,

2134
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:37,130
well they're doing.
It sounds like it's some kind of weird.

2135
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:40,130
Yeah,
they will for sure have done that.

2136
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:45,880
In Abu Dhabi.
They did it more than 50 times last 

2137
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:45,880
year.
I think they did it once a week.

2138
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:45,960
Last year.
They made it ran.

2139
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:48,470
Yeah.
I don't remember what the exact chemical

2140
01:35:48,471 --> 01:35:53,471
they use,
whether there's something with the gum 

2141
01:35:53,471 --> 01:35:54,410
line,
the crowds with a something silver.

2142
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:56,300
I don't remember what it is,
but um,

2143
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,460
they,
they in the clouds with this shit and it

2144
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,000
makes a rand.

2145
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:02,590
So it's so odd to think about Nicole.
It's still Nicholson,

2146
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:07,730
I don't know,
but it's really fucking odd to think 

2147
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,031
about the fact that they're just 
starting to learn to control the 

2148
01:36:10,031 --> 01:36:13,601
weather.
They're just starting to learn to 

2149
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:15,641
control the,
whether they're just starting to learn 

2150
01:36:15,641 --> 01:36:18,551
to have endless amounts of energy.
So if we were to evolve and advance 

2151
01:36:18,551 --> 01:36:20,930
without blowing each other up,
we would eventually be.

2152
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:25,460
We could eventually be a planet that has
full control of its weather patterns.

2153
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,300
Cloud seeding can actually be done by 
ground generators,

2154
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,900
a plane or it can be done by a rocket.
Weird.

2155
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,200
Yeah.
Wow.

2156
01:36:36,201 --> 01:36:41,201
Silver iodide,
dry ice solid carbon dioxide.

2157
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:48,310
Wow.
That Pasadena storm was 80 miles per 

2158
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:50,150
hour.
A ef one tornado 73 miles per hour.

2159
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,820
So it's pretty close.
It's faster than f one.

2160
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:56,780
What?
It's how fast a f one starts at 73 miles

2161
01:36:56,781 --> 01:36:58,850
per hour in that Pasadena store ans 80 
miles.

2162
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,350
Oh,
I thought you had them reversed.

2163
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:03,950
So it's faster than a tornado.
It was like an ef one tornado.

2164
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:07,070
Really?
That doesn't even make sense.

2165
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:09,230
Where there's different levels of 
tornadoes.

2166
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:11,070
Oh,
so it was like bitch ass tornadoes don't

2167
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,320
to kill anybody.
Well,

2168
01:37:12,321 --> 01:37:16,670
not really bitch ass that.
That's a good tornado,

2169
01:37:16,671 --> 01:37:17,900
Joe.
Yeah.

2170
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:23,320
Yeah.
It's like the beginning of a hurricane 

2171
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:23,320
winds.
They have.

2172
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:26,350
They've even used liquid propane to make
it rain expands into a gas has also been

2173
01:37:27,501 --> 01:37:32,501
used.
This can be can ice crystals at higher 

2174
01:37:32,501 --> 01:37:35,531
temperatures than silver iodide.
The use of high gross scopic materials 

2175
01:37:36,431 --> 01:37:41,330
such as salt is becoming more popular 
after promising research citation needed

2176
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:45,170
seating in cows requires that they 
contained super cooled liquid water.

2177
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:48,800
That is that liquid water colder than 
zero degrees Celsius.

2178
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:51,800
The introduction of a substance such as 
silver iodide,

2179
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:54,680
which has crystalline structure similar 
to that of ice,

2180
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:59,740
will induce freezing nucleation,
dry ice or propane expansion cools the 

2181
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:04,860
air to such an extent that the ice 
crystals can nucleate spontaneously from

2182
01:38:04,861 --> 01:38:05,700
the vapor phase.

2183
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:06,660
Wow.
This is crazy.

2184
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:08,840
Kids in the future,
people are terrified.

2185
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:12,050
In the fucking future.
You might be able to send your name,

2186
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:15,330
your personal nanobots swarm out of your
house,

2187
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:20,360
into the clouds above your house and 
make a little personal thunder shower 

2188
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,160
happen above your house.
Yeah.

2189
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:26,180
You probably will be able to.
That's how much it probably pulls water 

2190
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:26,180
from farmers.
You know?

2191
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:27,060
It's probably like.
I mean,

2192
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:27,960
yeah.
Where does that,

2193
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:30,450
what we like when you go to a place like
Abu Dhabi,

2194
01:38:30,451 --> 01:38:33,210
which is in the desert and they're.
All of a sudden they're making it rain.

2195
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,470
Yeah.
What are they doing?

2196
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:36,990
Where's that water coming from?
Somebody else getting fucked over,

2197
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,300
but you don't know.
But anyway.

2198
01:38:39,301 --> 01:38:40,890
Does that other person deserve that 
water?

2199
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:45,970
Who?
Who fucking deserves a lot of the smart 

2200
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:47,901
manager figures out how to pull it out 
of the sky or some shithead just camps 

2201
01:38:47,901 --> 01:38:51,251
out next to it and I get lucky with my 
water is joining mine.

2202
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:56,490
I found a spot in the dirt and I claim 
it.

2203
01:38:56,491 --> 01:38:57,140
Yeah.
No,

2204
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:59,790
I think the guy who pulls it out of the 
sky shit when for sure.

2205
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:02,400
Fuck that stupid color.
Anyone can make a puddle.

2206
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,860
Yeah,
so there is.

2207
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:08,040
There is some cloud seeding.
It's real science.

2208
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,270
Whether or not that shit is happening in
Burbank everyday like Eddie Bravo thinks

2209
01:39:12,271 --> 01:39:13,430
it is.
All right.

2210
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,710
Yeah.
That's where it gets tricky now that.

2211
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:17,730
Yeah.
What do you think it is?

2212
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,310
I can error planes.
That's all it is.

2213
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,700
It's funny because it's always near an 
airport.

2214
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:26,040
Like I live in Burbank.
I see it all the time because I lived by

2215
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:31,050
Burbank because dude,
you don't even understand that's the 

2216
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:31,370
government is spraying.
You're spraying the sky pilot.

2217
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:33,720
I just want to know.
The pilots are so there are these pilots

2218
01:39:33,721 --> 01:39:35,370
who were flying over the city and 
they're like,

2219
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:38,520
let's dump poison for the good of the 
country.

2220
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:40,740
That they think they're creating clouds 
for us.

2221
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,430
I don't think they're doing it as much 
as johnny.

2222
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:45,390
They,
it's listens every.

2223
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:50,620
The insurance companies have to pay 
money on skin cancer and it's way 

2224
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:50,620
cheaper.
If we have a closet door,

2225
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:53,830
we got to cover it up.
I don't want some burns to have.

2226
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:58,230
I think what I've read and whatever,
what's been explained to me by pilots is

2227
01:39:58,231 --> 01:40:03,231
that under certain conditions there's a 
certain amount of moisture in the air 

2228
01:40:03,231 --> 01:40:04,230
and it gets turned up in the,
the uh,

2229
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:09,740
turbines have a jet engine and it comes 
out looking like clouds and it stays in 

2230
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:09,740
this guy for a while.
Turned up water.

2231
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:11,660
Can I tell you what the real fucking 
conspiracy.

2232
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:13,890
I figured it out.
Oh my God.

2233
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:19,250
It's the conspiracy of all conspiracies.
It's your inability to stop your hand 

2234
01:40:20,131 --> 01:40:21,960
from putting shit into your mouth.

2235
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:27,110
That's the conspiracy dude.
It's the fact that people can't control 

2236
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:31,101
their fucking hand and are always 
shoving poison into their mouth and 

2237
01:40:31,101 --> 01:40:34,620
eating shitty things and smoking shitty 
things and taking bad pictures.

2238
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:37,320
This was going to be profound.
I feel like that is profound,

2239
01:40:37,321 --> 01:40:39,660
man.
I can remember talking to a guy believed

2240
01:40:39,661 --> 01:40:42,120
in Kim trails some fucking help,
some discipline.

2241
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:43,530
Well,
that's what I'm saying.

2242
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:48,740
I was talking to a guy believed in chem 
trails and he was smoking a cigarette 

2243
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:52,530
while he was telling me about the 
poisons that the government's dumping.

2244
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:53,560
Oh yeah.
Well Michael Rupert.

2245
01:40:53,561 --> 01:40:55,660
When Michael Rupert in here,
he's sweating like crazy.

2246
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,160
Talking about conspiracy theorist Alex 
Jones spoke,

2247
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:02,080
man,
you're killing yourself.

2248
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:07,120
Like maybe there is some kind of like 
evil external force that's trying to 

2249
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:11,071
destroy you,
but really you're the one shoveling the 

2250
01:41:11,071 --> 01:41:13,450
poison and your fucking in in your pile,
you know for sure is going to kill you.

2251
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:16,300
You're aiding them by bringing these 
troops into your body.

2252
01:41:16,301 --> 01:41:17,680
Saying one day I'm going to fight them 
off,

2253
01:41:17,681 --> 01:41:19,690
but not now.
By now,

2254
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:21,880
I just fucking sick to try to figure it 
out.

2255
01:41:21,881 --> 01:41:24,430
I'm a pete.
These motherfuckers signed for my fourth

2256
01:41:24,431 --> 01:41:28,090
cupcake going to drink because let's 
have.

2257
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:30,500
Let's have 17 beers today.
Again,

2258
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:35,520
I think it comes back to what we were 
talking about earlier about the native 

2259
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,011
Americans having a much better sense of 
their connection with the food that 

2260
01:41:38,011 --> 01:41:42,001
they're eating and that for us,
that whole hunter gatherer thing is out 

2261
01:41:42,001 --> 01:41:45,661
the window.
I go to the vons and I pick up meat and 

2262
01:41:45,661 --> 01:41:45,661
I go to,
you know,

2263
01:41:45,661 --> 01:41:46,600
get up,
get myself a nice salad and that's it.

2264
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:51,601
I didn't have to pick anything.
I don't have to go get my water in 

2265
01:41:51,601 --> 01:41:53,260
bottles because all the water's poison.
You can't drink it.

2266
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:54,940
People die occasionally.
Yeah,

2267
01:41:54,941 --> 01:41:57,010
totally dude.
And it's just so funny though,

2268
01:41:57,011 --> 01:42:02,011
that so many people writhing in physical
discomfort because they're too fat or 

2269
01:42:02,111 --> 01:42:04,690
they don't exercise or they don't eat 
right.

2270
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:09,010
Are upset about a conspiracy that the 
government is,

2271
01:42:09,011 --> 01:42:11,260
is involved in,
is trying to take,

2272
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,770
take away their happiness or their 
freedom or,

2273
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:15,130
or,
or dumb them down.

2274
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:15,760
It's like,
no,

2275
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:16,120
no,
no.

2276
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:20,290
You don't exercise.
You eat at Mcdonald's,

2277
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:23,650
you smoke cigarettes,
you're house is fucking filthy.

2278
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,690
That's the shit you should worry about 
first.

2279
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:28,600
Fix that conspiracy,
solve that problem.

2280
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:33,601
Like stop that conspiracy from happening
and then worry about the fucking chem 

2281
01:42:33,601 --> 01:42:37,321
trails.
I've been obsessed lately with this 

2282
01:42:37,321 --> 01:42:38,470
finding bigfoot show,
watching the show left and right.

2283
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:40,600
And it leaves me to sometimes,
you know,

2284
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:46,110
stone tweets in the middle of the night 
mocking them and everybody and myself 

2285
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:47,350
and I'll fucking stupid and for watching
the show.

2286
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:52,560
But uh,
it is a psychological study and one of 

2287
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,930
psychological studies is who are these 
people that are believing in bigfoot?

2288
01:42:56,050 --> 01:42:57,970
Who were these people that are leading 
these guys?

2289
01:42:57,971 --> 01:43:02,971
And this is what we saw and we're 
standing here and it comes out and they 

2290
01:43:03,251 --> 01:43:05,410
never asked these dudes.
They never go,

2291
01:43:05,411 --> 01:43:08,320
okay.
What do you think about ghosts?

2292
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:11,560
Right?
Do you believe in Ufos?

2293
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:14,470
What about psychics?
Do you,

2294
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,470
how do you feel about.
What do you think is,

2295
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:22,510
do you think chem trails are real?
Like what do you think happened in area 

2296
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:24,880
51?
What do you think is in Hungary team get

2297
01:43:24,881 --> 01:43:29,590
to the bottom of what the Messenger is?
Because a lot of times the Messenger who

2298
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:34,090
is giving you this really crazy,
preposterous,

2299
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:36,640
outrageous story.
They,

2300
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:39,220
they,
they lean towards that shit.

2301
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:43,240
They want that shit to be real.
They might not even be lying,

2302
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:48,420
but they might.
They might be just seeing shit in the 

2303
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:49,090
woods just because they're fucking wired
for that.

2304
01:43:49,091 --> 01:43:52,130
They want to see it.
They want to believe they want to

2305
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,370
and they can't be fucking trusted.
When they go to these finding big foot,

2306
01:43:55,371 --> 01:43:56,990
they go to these local town halls and 
shit.

2307
01:43:56,991 --> 01:43:57,680
They go,
all right,

2308
01:43:57,681 --> 01:44:02,681
who here has seen a sasquatch?
And these motherfuckers raised their 

2309
01:44:02,681 --> 01:44:03,320
hands and I'm like,
you are.

2310
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:08,321
I'm like,
you assholes are missing the whole real 

2311
01:44:08,321 --> 01:44:08,321
show.
The whole real show.

2312
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:13,530
It's,
it can't be done by them because they 

2313
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:16,931
are the people that the whole real show 
is a bunch of fucking people that want 

2314
01:44:16,931 --> 01:44:18,630
to believe in big foot so bad.
They're out in the woods.

2315
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:20,900
That's a squash.
That was definitely a squash.

2316
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:21,680
The yell out,

2317
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:30,230
the yelling out in the fucking woods 
screaming at the top of their lungs and 

2318
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:31,150
then they hear something that you're 
something knock.

2319
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:36,210
Someone's knocking the Hiller Annie,
who knows what it could be a producer 

2320
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:37,330
thrown a rock.
You know,

2321
01:44:37,331 --> 01:44:39,150
he's got to squash.
That's definitely a squash,

2322
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:41,500
squash country.
That's a squash.

2323
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:43,300
What else do you believe in?
Dude?

2324
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,350
Where do you.
What do you.

2325
01:44:44,670 --> 01:44:46,450
What do you do at night when you go to 
bed?

2326
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:47,860
What?
What is going on in your mind?

2327
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:49,900
What are you hoping for?
Do you believe in aliens?

2328
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,190
Do you?
What do you believe?

2329
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:53,800
Do you believe in ghosts?
You believe in vampires,

2330
01:44:53,801 --> 01:44:54,700
vampires,
rail.

2331
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:56,890
How much other crazy shit and you 
believe in?

2332
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:03,090
I think that it's more logical to 
believe in aliens and that believe in 

2333
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:06,040
bigfoot,
not necessarily big foot is a.

2334
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:11,100
first of all.
Jane Goodall was a firm Believer in 

2335
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:11,100
bigfoot and actually stated that,
you know,

2336
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:12,670
famous primate expert stated that it 
must be real,

2337
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:16,960
that there's too many sightings of the 
same animal all over the world and it is

2338
01:45:16,961 --> 01:45:21,961
very possible that there is enough area 
that hasn't been discovered or it's too 

2339
01:45:21,961 --> 01:45:23,710
densely wooded that it support a large 
primary like that.

2340
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:26,140
If it was intelligent and knew to hide 
from people.

2341
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:29,080
There's 250 different names for it in 
North America,

2342
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:31,190
in the American Indian language.
That's,

2343
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:33,460
that's big and because there's not a lot
of shit that's not real.

2344
01:45:33,461 --> 01:45:36,460
If they don't have names for and it's 
based on a real animal,

2345
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:38,860
we're going to get a guy in here that's 
a fucking expert on it,

2346
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:41,620
which means nothing.
I'm satisfied.

2347
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:44,840
I'm going to ask her for Shit.
That's probably not right.

2348
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:48,060
This is going to be great because on the
loch ness monster you are foreign.

2349
01:45:48,061 --> 01:45:52,050
You have California.
Did you get like a license for that?

2350
01:45:52,051 --> 01:45:55,120
And I have photoshop.
I think it comes with a few.

2351
01:45:55,121 --> 01:45:55,870
Um,
you know,

2352
01:45:55,871 --> 01:45:59,140
if you look at the stories that have 
gone back to like,

2353
01:45:59,141 --> 01:45:59,950
you know,
long,

2354
01:45:59,951 --> 01:46:03,160
long fucking time in history for sure.
Some people saw bears,

2355
01:46:03,161 --> 01:46:08,161
they shit their pants.
I as a person and they made up a story 

2356
01:46:08,161 --> 01:46:08,161
for sure.

2357
01:46:08,161 --> 01:46:09,250
Sometimes people remember things in our 
own lives.

2358
01:46:09,251 --> 01:46:10,400
We know this,
you know,

2359
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:13,210
my,
my mom is terrible at remembering things

2360
01:46:13,211 --> 01:46:15,160
that really happened.
I'll tell my mom something,

2361
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,650
don't do it.
And I know it happened.

2362
01:46:17,651 --> 01:46:20,650
I was there,
I remember it for sure it happened,

2363
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:25,920
but she will swear.
I mean you show her pictures of Angela 

2364
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:25,920
whole.
Well,

2365
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,250
I don't remember that.
No,

2366
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:31,710
when we did that,
a game show in my head show and I told 

2367
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:32,310
you,
we got people to talk about Ufos.

2368
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:37,620
Got them to make up a Ufo story because 
we pretended to be a news guy that had 

2369
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:39,010
gotten there too late.
Would you mind pretending the use of the

2370
01:46:39,011 --> 01:46:41,470
Ufo people just started talking,
man,

2371
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:45,220
just so excited they were going to get 
on television and when I'm watching this

2372
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:50,280
stupid bigfoot show and I'm looking at 
these people trouncing through the 

2373
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:54,111
woods,
I'm looking at a bunch of people that 

2374
01:46:54,111 --> 01:46:54,111
are lonely.

2375
01:46:54,111 --> 01:46:54,111
They don't have any real purpose in 
their life.

2376
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:59,160
There's these people that don't have 
real good friends is one weird guy with 

2377
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,470
his poor fucking kid and this kid was 
like,

2378
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:04,980
my dad might be crazy sitting here 
talking about we saw bigfoot together.

2379
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:07,230
What the fuck did we really see?
My Dad's a liar.

2380
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:10,920
My Dad's claiming you saw big foot and 
in the kids sort of along along with it,

2381
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:15,950
you can wash them.
You look at the insincerity and their 

2382
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:16,440
words.
They had a guy on the other day just gay

2383
01:47:16,441 --> 01:47:19,290
as fuck.
Just beyond gay,

2384
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:24,500
just crazy flock of seagulls haircut 
list everything wandering through the 

2385
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:25,250
woods,
seeing bigfoot.

2386
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:30,340
I'm sure you did crazy.
You insane asshole.

2387
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:32,040
Believe that show exists,
man.

2388
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:36,150
It sounds hilarious.
Like exactly like ghost hunters in that.

2389
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:38,490
Although shows feature night vision and 
nothing.

2390
01:47:40,150 --> 01:47:43,510
That's all you need.
Just a house in night vision.

2391
01:47:43,511 --> 01:47:44,090
It seems crazy.

2392
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:49,180
Yeah.
I was having a twitter exchange with 

2393
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:50,951
this chick the other day and we were 
going off about how combined the two 

2394
01:47:50,951 --> 01:47:52,150
shows and just make it a porno and 
that's really what it is.

2395
01:47:52,151 --> 01:47:55,370
Split two lonely people who have the 
night vision,

2396
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,780
unkempt,
pubes,

2397
01:47:56,990 --> 01:48:00,920
fatty,
sweaty bodies and night vision loads.

2398
01:48:01,130 --> 01:48:02,270
Loneliness,
dude.

2399
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:05,630
They're all pretending to hear thing I 
saw or heard something come in here real

2400
01:48:05,631 --> 01:48:08,990
quick and then they fuck like getting a 
car and the darkness and they just.

2401
01:48:08,991 --> 01:48:11,000
I think I heard something.
I think your fingering me,

2402
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,820
I think they'll keep the ghosts away or 
two.

2403
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:17,230
I think it'll keep.
It goes if you suck my cock.

2404
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,840
Yeah.
Scare them.

2405
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:21,650
Scan with your boldness and then they 
fucking the darkness.

2406
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:23,840
They fucking the door and then the guy 
has to get away with.

2407
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:24,910
Then they,
you know,

2408
01:48:25,070 --> 01:48:26,060
after guy comes,
he's like,

2409
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:27,500
I just fucking hurt something for real.

2410
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:28,790
Holy Shit.
I'm not kidding now.

2411
01:48:28,791 --> 01:48:33,791
And he runs out of the room.
That's how they get out of it because 

2412
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:34,150
after you come,
you know the girl wants a cuddle.

2413
01:48:34,151 --> 01:48:36,980
It's like we can't cut over in the 
fucking in a haunted house.

2414
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:39,710
Hired something.
Jesus is real and he just runs.

2415
01:48:39,711 --> 01:48:40,940
She's like,
you didn't hear shit.

2416
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:44,540
Give it the night vision.
She can't see.

2417
01:48:44,541 --> 01:48:46,430
She stuck in the fucking basement in the
corner.

2418
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:47,990
This guy like,
come on,

2419
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:50,060
what?
I'll tell you warmer.

2420
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:53,420
You're getting towards the door warmer.
Give me the night vision.

2421
01:48:53,570 --> 01:48:55,970
I can't fucking seat foam.
She hits the wall.

2422
01:48:55,971 --> 01:48:59,270
Start screaming no more pussy for him.
That's a weird show,

2423
01:48:59,271 --> 01:49:03,200
Joe.
They pretend to hear things.

2424
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:04,640
What was that?
What was that?

2425
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:06,440
How many of those shows are they said,
what was that?

2426
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:07,850
What was that?
What was that?

2427
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:11,420
It was you being a crazy asshole alone 
either in the woods or in a basement.

2428
01:49:11,421 --> 01:49:12,900
Either looking for bigfoot or a ghost.

2429
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:18,310
Fuck all that shit.
Think about the fact that the Catholic 

2430
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,920
Church still does exorcisms.
Think about that shit,

2431
01:49:18,921 --> 01:49:21,110
dude.
Fucking Catholic priests will.

2432
01:49:21,170 --> 01:49:26,170
Right now there's probably a priest in 
somebodies house getting a demon out of 

2433
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:28,040
somebody's body.
Think about that.

2434
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:30,020
Fucking big foot fine.
Aliens.

2435
01:49:30,021 --> 01:49:32,210
Fine.
There's guys dressed as God.

2436
01:49:32,211 --> 01:49:37,211
Clowns waving around symbols in front of
little kids faces to try to get 

2437
01:49:37,211 --> 01:49:37,910
imaginary demons to go out to them.

2438
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,800
What's really amazing is way more 
priests out there.

2439
01:49:40,801 --> 01:49:45,770
Fucking kids are doing extra stuff way 
more,

2440
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:48,370
way more.
That's fucked up statistic.

2441
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,050
We need to figure out if that's true,
man.

2442
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:56,010
So there's more priests molesting kids 
and they are getting the demons out of 

2443
01:49:56,010 --> 01:49:56,010
kids.
Well,

2444
01:49:56,010 --> 01:49:57,180
we were talking about on the podcast 
with Joey,

2445
01:49:57,181 --> 01:50:00,720
we're talking about how people who run 
martial arts schools often,

2446
01:50:00,721 --> 01:50:05,721
it's very culty and the guy who is at 
the head is the master and is almost 

2447
01:50:05,721 --> 01:50:09,531
beyond reproach and that a lot of times 
weird sexual shit happens because of 

2448
01:50:09,531 --> 01:50:10,200
that,
because it becomes like a cult.

2449
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:15,560
Well,
that is exactly what happens in the 

2450
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:15,560
Catholic church and even like in martial
arts schools,

2451
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:16,400
like people try to keep things under 
wraps,

2452
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:20,200
like there's always like dark secrets.
So this guy fucking the students and the

2453
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:24,710
fucking one of his students who was 
married and the husband finds out about.

2454
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:29,730
There's always those kinds of scandals,
very cult like and with every real 

2455
01:50:29,941 --> 01:50:33,480
controlling cult,
there's an element of sexuality and it's

2456
01:50:33,481 --> 01:50:36,540
usually creepy.
It's not like a peace love,

2457
01:50:36,570 --> 01:50:41,570
you know,
everyone polyamorous and whether sexual 

2458
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:41,570
or non,
you know,

2459
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:43,470
everything is just about nonjudgmental 
affection.

2460
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:43,910
No,
no,

2461
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,180
no.
Most of is not.

2462
01:50:45,181 --> 01:50:47,280
Most of it's creepy.
It's victim set.

2463
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:49,690
Thanks dude.
And then think about this,

2464
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:52,750
take it back to the story that it comes 
from,

2465
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:57,751
whether it's real or not.
The story of the Catholic Church comes 

2466
01:50:57,751 --> 01:50:59,560
from name one guy dressed like a gnome 
in that story.

2467
01:50:59,710 --> 01:51:04,710
Name.
One guy wearing a big golden flowing 

2468
01:51:04,710 --> 01:51:07,321
cape and holding a funny thing and 
marching around with fucking that Purple

2469
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:13,200
Velvet on and fucking walking around on 
red carpets and giant golden palaces 

2470
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:14,680
were.
Find that in the New Testament,

2471
01:51:14,681 --> 01:51:18,290
find anything even remotely,
like the rituals outside the law.

2472
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:19,690
Uh,
the holy communion.

2473
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:21,590
Find anything.
It's fucking,

2474
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:24,610
especially,
although the audacious use of,

2475
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:29,670
of gold and money and spending.
Think about all the different gigantic 

2476
01:51:30,921 --> 01:51:35,921
Roman colosseum there.
The other were the sistine chapel or 

2477
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:36,230
think of any of the things of the 
construction in Rome.

2478
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:39,020
Any of the stuff that's at the Vatican 
that's like a really elaborate,

2479
01:51:39,021 --> 01:51:39,680
expensive,

2480
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:44,790
Gadi Non Christian Shit.
Think of what else could have been done 

2481
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:44,790
with all that energy,
but they're like,

2482
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:48,981
you know what?
Yet Jesus wanted us to have a beautiful 

2483
01:51:48,981 --> 01:51:50,970
giant Golden Palace where I could sit 
and fuck fucking fuck kids.

2484
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:55,330
Four kids on Red Velvet.
Yeah.

2485
01:51:55,331 --> 01:51:58,050
It's just what he wants.
That's this story.

2486
01:51:58,170 --> 01:51:59,990
And so like,
so it's very.

2487
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:00,450
Either way,

2488
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:04,060
this attitude is really offending a lot 
of people on twitter.

2489
01:52:04,061 --> 01:52:06,490
There's a lot of Christians that have 
sent me texts saying,

2490
01:52:06,790 --> 01:52:11,790
I wish you would remind me or at least 
warn us that before you go on these 

2491
01:52:12,671 --> 01:52:17,530
horrible Antichristian rants,
don't destroy our culture.

2492
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:17,950
Oh No,
no,

2493
01:52:17,951 --> 01:52:18,350
no.
See,

2494
01:52:18,351 --> 01:52:21,950
I'm not talking about Christianity.
I'm talking about the cult of loon loon,

2495
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:23,900
which is my Christianity.
That's not.

2496
01:52:23,901 --> 01:52:24,110
No,
no,

2497
01:52:24,111 --> 01:52:24,370
no,
no,

2498
01:52:24,490 --> 01:52:25,880
no.
Got To be pushing your loon.

2499
01:52:25,881 --> 01:52:30,881
Loon not to sell t shirts.
You Sound Lumina tee shirts and not a 

2500
01:52:30,881 --> 01:52:31,030
bad idea.
I am selling posts.

2501
01:52:31,031 --> 01:52:33,150
There's not a bad idea selling the 
fucking tee shirts,

2502
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,170
but no man.
It's no my moon brand.

2503
01:52:36,171 --> 01:52:38,510
It's the fucking church brand.
I would never take it from that,

2504
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:39,650
but do it.
It's,

2505
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:40,320
it's,
uh,

2506
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:41,810
uh,
that's not real.

2507
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:46,870
That's not what I view as real 
Christianity because you look at a lot 

2508
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:48,890
of the Christianity that some people 
follow.

2509
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:53,390
It's based on a lot of the writings of 
somebody named Paul who,

2510
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:54,770
uh,
never met Jesus.

2511
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:59,810
He was,
he was persecuted Christians and he was 

2512
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:01,070
walking on the road to Damascus.
It's not a vision.

2513
01:53:01,071 --> 01:53:05,030
His name was saul of Tarsus and he saw a
vision of Jesus.

2514
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,640
Jesus appeared in the sky and said,
Saul,

2515
01:53:07,641 --> 01:53:11,390
so why do you persecute me?
And at that moment saw was

2516
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:14,160
filled with the glory of the Lord.

2517
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:18,050
And he was blinded and he wandered and 
found some Christians,

2518
01:53:18,051 --> 01:53:23,051
Phantom and his name became Paul.
And he was the founder of the modern 

2519
01:53:23,051 --> 01:53:26,651
Christian church and you wrote all these
letters about what it is to be a in the 

2520
01:53:26,651 --> 01:53:29,060
spirit of Christ and to be with Christ,
but he never met God outside of,

2521
01:53:29,061 --> 01:53:30,170
in that vision.

2522
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:32,010
So essentially he was like Jimmy 
swaggered,

2523
01:53:32,011 --> 01:53:33,720
but a long time ago,
remember when Swagger,

2524
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,810
swagger to Pat Robertson,
southern 90 foot tall Jesus.

2525
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,460
I don't know,
but he had a vision.

2526
01:53:38,490 --> 01:53:43,490
This part,
the Paul of Tarsus had to add a vision 

2527
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:43,490
and I don't know,
I don't know which one,

2528
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:44,220
but yeah,
that's where it came from.

2529
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:47,070
It wasn't from the original teachings.
You know,

2530
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,980
the original teachings don't.
I'm sorry if I'm offending pizza.

2531
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,610
Really Weird though that.
Um,

2532
01:53:52,690 --> 01:53:54,210
uh Oh,
it was oral roberts,

2533
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:57,990
oral roberts,
900 foot tall Jesus in 1977,

2534
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:01,000
which is when he would have been around.
That was one 900 foot tall.

2535
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,850
Jesus was touring was part of the 
galaxy,

2536
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:08,600
the fucking galaxy coming to oral 
roberts in the middle of the desert and 

2537
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:12,291
showing show themself.
But it's really interesting to think 

2538
01:54:12,291 --> 01:54:12,291
about that when you realize that it's 
like,

2539
01:54:12,291 --> 01:54:13,380
so,
so a lot of people call,

2540
01:54:13,530 --> 01:54:15,720
um,
what's after the gospels,

2541
01:54:15,721 --> 01:54:17,880
the epistles at which a lot of them,

2542
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:20,770
holly in theology,
it's not Christian Christianity,

2543
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:24,490
it's based on because here's the big 
problem that Christians ran into in many

2544
01:54:24,491 --> 01:54:26,350
verses in the Bible.
Jesus said,

2545
01:54:26,650 --> 01:54:31,650
before some of you die,
I'm going to be back and even come back 

2546
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:36,650
in,
some of the disciples started dying and 

2547
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:36,650
then it's like,
wait a minute,

2548
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:36,650
he's not coming back,
what are we going to do?

2549
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:39,880
And they had to reorganize shit and turn
it into something that was like,

2550
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:43,060
that made more sense,
which is to deal with this,

2551
01:54:43,061 --> 01:54:43,540
uh,
some,

2552
01:54:43,570 --> 01:54:47,530
some basic problems.
And what Christ,

2553
01:54:47,531 --> 01:54:50,170
if he existed in that story,
he said it was going to happen,

2554
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:55,500
you know?
And now we've got the bank robbers 

2555
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:55,500
syndrome,
you know that,

2556
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:55,500
right?
It's the bank robber thing.

2557
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,520
What,
when somebody robs a bank,

2558
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:00,700
they say everybody get on the fucking 
ground and don't move.

2559
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:04,480
I'm going to walk out of here and I'm 
going to come back in two minutes.

2560
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:09,600
And if any of you have moved,
I'm going to blow your fucking brains 

2561
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:12,061
out.
This is what a bank robber does when 

2562
01:55:12,061 --> 01:55:12,340
he's robbing a bank.
This is what Jesus did when he said,

2563
01:55:12,370 --> 01:55:15,400
I'm going to be back really soon,
and if anyone's misbehaving,

2564
01:55:15,401 --> 01:55:20,401
you're going to hell forever.
And that's been going on for a long 

2565
01:55:20,401 --> 01:55:20,401
fucking time,
man,

2566
01:55:20,401 --> 01:55:22,900
and it's probably going to keep going on
and on and on,

2567
01:55:23,110 --> 01:55:26,530
and each it.
Each time it advances down a generation,

2568
01:55:26,531 --> 01:55:31,531
it gets weirder and weirder and weirder.
So now we've got a guy dressed like a 

2569
01:55:31,531 --> 01:55:32,140
fucking gnome feeling.
Totally cool,

2570
01:55:32,141 --> 01:55:36,190
sitting in a golden throne when there's 
people all over the planet starving.

2571
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:39,670
And somehow that guy is a disciple of a 
person who went around saying,

2572
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,500
love your neighbor as yourself and love 
the Lord your God with all heart,

2573
01:55:43,501 --> 01:55:44,190
mind,
and soul.

2574
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:49,220
By the way,
clear evidence that he harbored child 

2575
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:52,371
molesters.
Clear evidence that he derailed 

2576
01:55:52,371 --> 01:55:55,461
investigations and move people around 
when he was whatever the fuck he was a 

2577
01:55:55,461 --> 01:55:57,120
bishop or whatever the fuck he was when 
he was doing this.

2578
01:55:57,390 --> 01:55:59,210
He was in Phoenix.
Yeah.

2579
01:55:59,370 --> 01:56:00,600
Ratzinger.
You can't.

2580
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:02,540
I mean,
imagine the bitch.

2581
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:05,940
Have you ever seen the pictures of him 
with the male gymnast?

2582
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:10,970
The acrobatics that.
I honestly still think that that was 

2583
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:10,970
the.
I didn't because my brain seems fake.

2584
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:13,470
It's fake right now.
It's totally real.

2585
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:16,590
They the pope.
How did all that?

2586
01:56:16,591 --> 01:56:21,591
How does Catholicism become the leading 
source of power worldwide of 

2587
01:56:21,591 --> 01:56:22,610
Christianity?
Because there's red,

2588
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:24,290
there's all the other forms of 
Christianity.

2589
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:29,570
They seem to be much more scattered.
Like there's not like one heavy duty 

2590
01:56:29,570 --> 01:56:29,850
dude.
The head of it,

2591
01:56:29,851 --> 01:56:31,500
like Catholicism,
you know,

2592
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,570
we were.
Who's the main guy and Episcopalian?

2593
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:38,940
Who's the main guy in the baptist?
There's no one.

2594
01:56:38,941 --> 01:56:42,520
There's no main guy like the Catholic 
pope that's like there's a.

2595
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:44,670
there's a hierarchy in the episcopal 
church,

2596
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:46,260
but nothing like the.
You know what I'm saying?

2597
01:56:46,261 --> 01:56:49,140
Worldwide recognized the pope is the top
dog.

2598
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:52,980
How did that get to be the strongest,
most powerful form of Christianity,

2599
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:53,850
which is,
by the way,

2600
01:56:53,851 --> 01:56:57,690
also the most nuts,
the most fucking crazy judgmental,

2601
01:56:57,691 --> 01:57:02,691
the most guilt ridden in injecting 
horrible feelings of sorrow into little 

2602
01:57:02,691 --> 01:57:03,780
boys' heads because they touch their 
penis.

2603
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:04,620
Is there,
Joe?

2604
01:57:04,621 --> 01:57:09,621
Is there a,
is there a statistic on the what 

2605
01:57:09,621 --> 01:57:10,840
percentage of priests and the last kids 
is 89 percent,

2606
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:14,490
but we must know a certain number of 
them.

2607
01:57:14,491 --> 01:57:17,640
I don't think it comes up all the time.
I don't think they can.

2608
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:22,700
I don't think they know.
But is there a number of priests that 

2609
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:22,860
have gone,
gotten incarcerated for molesting kids?

2610
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:24,910
What's that number?
How many is it?

2611
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:27,840
Seven 97.
90 seven percent.

2612
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:29,830
Don't listen to him.
Listen,

2613
01:57:29,831 --> 01:57:33,180
I know you're talking to 20 percent of 
the allegations.

2614
01:57:33,181 --> 01:57:34,770
The priests was deceased.
Uh,

2615
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,800
let's see.
I'm just curious if they're sending the 

2616
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,620
campaign,
what percentage of priest abuse.

2617
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:45,330
Okay,
let's see here.

2618
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:48,360
Don't know ma'am.
Well,

2619
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:50,790
there is certainly a certain number of 
priests who had been charged.

2620
01:57:50,791 --> 01:57:52,500
I mean,
I know that that story has come up,

2621
01:57:52,501 --> 01:57:54,600
so there's gotta be some number.
I'm just wondering how many.

2622
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:56,400
Whoa,
what?

2623
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:57,150
Oh,
okay.

2624
01:57:57,151 --> 01:58:00,630
It's only for their concluding there.
I thought it's at 40 percent.

2625
01:58:00,631 --> 01:58:05,631
Holy Shit.
I my brain blip for a second and 

2626
01:58:05,631 --> 01:58:07,530
concluded that for about four percent of
the US priests since 1950,

2627
01:58:07,531 --> 01:58:09,480
I've been accused of sexual abuse of 
children.

2628
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:10,950
Okay.
However,

2629
01:58:10,951 --> 01:58:15,951
here's the caveats.
There are probably many victims who 

2630
01:58:15,951 --> 01:58:17,100
remain silent and not yet come forward 
to accuse their abusers.

2631
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:20,550
There are probably some adults who have 
come forward to accused priests who have

2632
01:58:20,551 --> 01:58:23,490
false recovered memories of abuse that 
never happened,

2633
01:58:23,491 --> 01:58:28,491
so it could be both ways.
Imagine maybe some adults who knowingly 

2634
01:58:28,491 --> 01:58:31,290
falsely accused innocent priests who 
abuse they do to imagine this.

2635
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:36,180
Imagine if four percent of people who 
work at apple stores had been accused of

2636
01:58:36,181 --> 01:58:37,170
molesting kids.
Yeah.

2637
01:58:37,171 --> 01:58:39,760
I used that onstage before.
You said that Nascar driver,

2638
01:58:39,761 --> 01:58:44,110
so saying a massive organization of 
Nascar drivers running around in circles

2639
01:58:44,111 --> 01:58:46,000
with their cars and then fucking kids,
you know,

2640
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:46,500
we,
we,

2641
01:58:46,501 --> 01:58:48,700
we'd say we don't need Nascar.
This is ridiculous.

2642
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:51,720
Yeah.
That four percent of apple employees,

2643
01:58:51,721 --> 01:58:54,070
probably molests kids because they're 
the computer nerds.

2644
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:54,400
They,
you know,

2645
01:58:54,401 --> 01:58:56,410
they don't get paid.
That's not even funny.

2646
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:58,120
I mean,
no,

2647
01:58:58,121 --> 01:58:59,650
I'm being serious there.
When you say like,

2648
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:04,800
no,
four percent of apple employees don't 

2649
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:04,800
fuck kids do.

2650
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:04,800
It's a tiny,
tiny,

2651
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,761
tiny,
tiny percentage of people in the whole 

2652
01:59:08,761 --> 01:59:08,890
world who were child molesters.
It's really small.

2653
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:10,750
The problem is when,
when it happens,

2654
01:59:10,751 --> 01:59:15,751
it's fucking devastating.
So if it's one in a community of a 

2655
01:59:15,751 --> 01:59:15,751
million people,
that's a lot.

2656
01:59:15,751 --> 01:59:16,690
1,000.
It's a lot.

2657
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:20,270
Have you looked at the APP that shows 
you who are near?

2658
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:23,290
There's like 300 in Burbank.
Yeah.

2659
01:59:23,291 --> 01:59:28,291
Well,
how many millions of people live in 

2660
01:59:28,291 --> 01:59:28,291
Burbank?
You know,

2661
01:59:28,291 --> 01:59:28,480
how many people you think live in 
Burbank?

2662
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:30,710
Let's say population of Burbank.
I'm going to go 500,000

2663
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:35,810
deal with every series.
This is something I've been trying to 

2664
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:37,060
figure out for years.
I can't wait to hear the answer.

2665
01:59:44,150 --> 01:59:46,670
What is the population at Burbank,
California?

2666
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:51,430
One hundred and 3000.
Three hundred 40.

2667
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:53,910
To answer your question.
Yeah.

2668
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:55,250
Yeah.
I got your bench.

2669
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:56,410
One hundred.
Three thousand.

2670
01:59:56,411 --> 02:00:00,100
Three hundred 40 in 2010.
So out of that,

2671
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:02,350
how many,
how many pedals are in Burbank?

2672
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:04,030
MMM.

2673
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:09,730
Isn't that a song?
Should be some hipsters on some ironic,

2674
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,630
ironic hipster song about beddoes.
Yeah,

2675
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:15,870
I'd probably say I would probably say it
100.

2676
02:00:16,610 --> 02:00:21,610
There's A.
There's a an uncomfortable number of 

2677
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:22,340
people that have fuck kids.
That's an question.

2678
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:27,750
Yeah.
It's all pretty disgusting and 

2679
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:27,750
terrifying.
Really.

2680
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:32,600
That's one of the first things that we 
should eradicate because if that's 

2681
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:35,890
something that flux kid up for the rest 
of her life and then if they lash out 

2682
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:35,890
and start doing on new kids,
then they become.

2683
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:37,780
We talked about this,
that it's like a vampire.

2684
02:00:37,781 --> 02:00:42,781
It's real vampires like you actually do 
infect someone and make them what you 

2685
02:00:42,781 --> 02:00:44,990
are.
A monster transmits itself and it's been

2686
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:47,030
transmitted for a fucking long time,
man.

2687
02:00:47,031 --> 02:00:49,010
It's been being transmitted for 
generations.

2688
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:54,040
It's such a gross thing.
It's such a broken thing and it has 

2689
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:54,040
roots in primate behavior.

2690
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:58,040
That's what's really fucked up about it.
Sexuality is so strange and in our world

2691
02:00:58,041 --> 02:01:01,100
it's so.
It's so unnatural because we're actually

2692
02:01:01,101 --> 02:01:04,010
covering our bodies up.
We hide our genitals.

2693
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:09,480
You know,
we have this weird sort of a common 

2694
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:12,550
atory lifestyle of natural animal urges 
mixed with his higher self and 

2695
02:01:14,811 --> 02:01:19,811
consciousness in language and the 
awareness of the impact of your words 

2696
02:01:19,811 --> 02:01:23,441
and deeds and physical acts on other 
people and that you're putting out a 

2697
02:01:23,441 --> 02:01:26,300
negative energy in a negative vibe.
And we encourage that in our communities

2698
02:01:26,301 --> 02:01:28,970
and discourage that in our,
in our laws.

2699
02:01:29,390 --> 02:01:31,490
But the reality is we have these 
fucking,

2700
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:34,430
these urges to fuck and they're not 
regulated.

2701
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:36,680
They're not like,
no one's like recognizing that like,

2702
02:01:36,681 --> 02:01:37,200
hey,
you know,

2703
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:40,090
we need to like why is,
is prostitution bad?

2704
02:01:40,090 --> 02:01:44,240
If someone explained that to me,
if someone needs money and someone has a

2705
02:01:44,241 --> 02:01:45,350
mouth,
you know,

2706
02:01:45,351 --> 02:01:46,430
and they go,
you know what,

2707
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:49,430
I can make a lot of money with this 
mouth and what is worse?

2708
02:01:49,610 --> 02:01:54,610
Working at Wendy's for a week and making
$300 or sucking a guy's Dick for 10 

2709
02:01:55,941 --> 02:01:59,120
minutes and making $500.
And a lot of people will go,

2710
02:01:59,121 --> 02:02:01,460
I would rather suck this guy's Dick and 
this guy,

2711
02:02:01,461 --> 02:02:03,860
he's some poor guy who's Horny,
you know,

2712
02:02:03,861 --> 02:02:08,861
and it's like you give him a mouth 
massage on his dick and he blows a load 

2713
02:02:09,171 --> 02:02:11,630
in your mouth and he's so happy.
Oh my God,

2714
02:02:11,631 --> 02:02:13,760
he's so released like,
that was so good.

2715
02:02:13,761 --> 02:02:16,220
And he gives you $100 tip.
Now you made 600 bucks.

2716
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:17,710
Why is that bad?
I don't.

2717
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:19,970
I'm not sure.
Why is it okay to do that for free?

2718
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:22,100
How come if she meets that guy and she 
likes him,

2719
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:24,380
she blows them and it's the greatest 
thing that ever happened,

2720
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,190
then that's fine.
But if she meets that guy and you know,

2721
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:29,000
he's like,
listen,

2722
02:02:29,090 --> 02:02:34,090
I have 500 bucks and I would like to get
my dick sucked and I know your hard 

2723
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:34,490
earned money and we want to make a deal.
Why is that bad?

2724
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:35,030
Wow.

2725
02:02:35,290 --> 02:02:35,920
I,
yeah,

2726
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,720
it's a,
it's a what do you want one?

2727
02:02:38,230 --> 02:02:43,230
I just found a website that tells you 
how many sex offenders are in each city 

2728
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:47,071
and Los Angeles.
And it's pretty shocking at the highest 

2729
02:02:47,071 --> 02:02:47,071
numbered one.
No.

2730
02:02:47,071 --> 02:02:49,270
Right.
So Burbank has 1,875

2731
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:51,520
sex offenders.
That's more than one percent.

2732
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:52,990
Yeah.
Beverly Hills,

2733
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:53,800
wasn't it?
Yeah.

2734
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:58,270
Beverly Hills is the highest railing 
with 4,903.

2735
02:02:58,271 --> 02:03:01,150
Which is weird because Beverly Hills,
there's more people that live in Burbank

2736
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:02,620
and then beverly hills.
Right.

2737
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:04,510
That's a good question.
Um,

2738
02:03:04,690 --> 02:03:06,500
so,
so is it because money.

2739
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:09,340
Yeah.
So money equals,

2740
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:14,400
that's kind of weird.
Pasadena here we got a really hills 

2741
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:14,400
pedophiles.
One thousand,

2742
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:19,261
306 here.
Because I mean there's like Beverly 

2743
02:03:19,261 --> 02:03:19,261
Hills,
the houses are spread apart.

2744
02:03:19,261 --> 02:03:20,170
There's not as many people crammed in.
Yeah.

2745
02:03:20,171 --> 02:03:25,171
There's only 34,000
people live in Beverly Hills and they 

2746
02:03:25,171 --> 02:03:27,070
have 4,903.
You guys,

2747
02:03:27,071 --> 02:03:30,160
we have figured out to crazy fucking 
things in this podcast.

2748
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:35,400
Number one,
Coca Cola is making the majority of 

2749
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:35,680
cocaine in the world.
And number two,

2750
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:39,610
beverly hills is filled with.
Holy Shit.

2751
02:03:39,611 --> 02:03:41,980
Wow.
That's groundbreaking shit,

2752
02:03:41,981 --> 02:03:43,210
man.
That's crazy.

2753
02:03:43,211 --> 02:03:45,910
We need to spark up and think about 
those two heavy.

2754
02:03:45,970 --> 02:03:48,070
Oh,
we might have people coming here for the

2755
02:03:48,071 --> 02:03:49,840
next show.
Whatever.

2756
02:03:49,841 --> 02:03:51,610
Would those targets?
Did you want to eat?

2757
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:54,150
I'm not supposed to anymore.
I apologize.

2758
02:03:54,151 --> 02:03:55,410
We can't say it anymore,
man,

2759
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:58,030
that word,
but it's my friends.

2760
02:03:58,060 --> 02:03:59,980
Every now and then I'll slip one out and
plus they're already.

2761
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:05,140
Sounds great.
You know what actually got me saying it 

2762
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:05,140
a couple times just to.
My friends got damn stand hopes.

2763
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:08,320
New CD.
Really funny by the way,

2764
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:12,520
before himself it's called.
It's really good.

2765
02:04:12,521 --> 02:04:14,800
It's,
I think it stan host best work,

2766
02:04:14,801 --> 02:04:19,480
but he says Fagen and a couple of times 
with my God I missed that word for word.

2767
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:24,820
It's just the problem is it's associated
as a gay slur and even though I have a 

2768
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:28,060
lot of like pro gay stuff in my act 
especially now have a lot of still.

2769
02:04:28,061 --> 02:04:30,700
You can't say it.
You can't say right now,

2770
02:04:30,701 --> 02:04:34,020
man,
I ain't never liked this great word.

2771
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:39,520
I like call me animals didn't like it 
because you get called out a few too 

2772
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:39,520
many times.

2773
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:44,300
I set you up for that one.
That's now I just fucking such a shitty.

2774
02:04:44,761 --> 02:04:49,680
It's like always coming out of the mouth
of fucking dope fucking rednecks and the

2775
02:04:49,681 --> 02:04:53,010
backs of school buses and just dip shits
playing.

2776
02:04:53,011 --> 02:04:55,320
Fucking true xbox.
They ruined it.

2777
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:56,160
The flux.
Yeah,

2778
02:04:56,161 --> 02:04:58,560
they ruined it.
I could have had some years.

2779
02:04:58,930 --> 02:05:01,620
Yeah.
My 40th birthday cake,

2780
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:06,800
jody is Ari Shapiro got me a fucking 
birthday cake and said happy birthday,

2781
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:11,190
and it was beautiful.
Beautiful.

2782
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:16,220
You know what it seems like back then it
was okay to say that was only like four 

2783
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:19,251
years ago when I put my special out.
It changed while I was doing and come in

2784
02:05:19,741 --> 02:05:24,741
and out.
They had a real problem using the word 

2785
02:05:24,741 --> 02:05:24,741
faggot.
Why?

2786
02:05:24,741 --> 02:05:27,170
Remember when we were just in Texas 
saying retard like that was shocking 

2787
02:05:27,170 --> 02:05:27,900
that you can't really use retard either 
right now.

2788
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:28,880
That's.
That was weird.

2789
02:05:28,890 --> 02:05:31,630
I retard became a problem in Austin,
in the vaults.

2790
02:05:32,030 --> 02:05:33,110
Austin.
We're in Austin.

2791
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,530
I said,
you gotta stop with the retard.

2792
02:05:34,770 --> 02:05:36,430
It became a problem.
Yeah.

2793
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:39,120
Political correctness is fucking 
completely ridiculous.

2794
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:40,910
Supporting his intent.
Her trainees,

2795
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:45,950
the new word tranny tranny's shut up.
You can't say tranny and people were 

2796
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:47,160
telling me that today that trainees the 
new.

2797
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:50,030
I don't believe that.
Oh,

2798
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,300
I wouldn't know.
It can never take away our trend.

2799
02:05:52,301 --> 02:05:52,980
No.
You know what?

2800
02:05:52,981 --> 02:05:56,290
I believe it because I've seen someone 
say in,

2801
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:59,640
in someone accusing someone of being a 
homophobe.

2802
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:03,780
They said something about them upsetting
the lesbian.

2803
02:06:04,050 --> 02:06:05,850
Gay.
It was like l,

2804
02:06:05,851 --> 02:06:06,990
G,
b,

2805
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:08,640
t,
q.

2806
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:11,820
I go by,
I go queue.

2807
02:06:12,270 --> 02:06:12,810
I go,
wait a minute.

2808
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:15,060
I go lesbian,
lesbian,

2809
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:17,820
gay,
transsexual,

2810
02:06:18,990 --> 02:06:23,520
transvestite Que [inaudible] Q.
which ones that?

2811
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:24,710
Queer?
Queer.

2812
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:30,160
Queer is a totally obscure one.
They don't want to define it like they 

2813
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:30,160
might like guys.

2814
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:31,830
They might like girls.
They might be by.

2815
02:06:31,831 --> 02:06:33,270
They might be weird.
They're queer.

2816
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:36,000
Whatever the fuck they are.
What is that?

2817
02:06:36,001 --> 02:06:41,001
How can you.
Is that the most ambiguous definition 

2818
02:06:41,001 --> 02:06:41,001
ever?
Have a sexuality as queer,

2819
02:06:41,001 --> 02:06:45,560
queer south,
but that's when people are going real 

2820
02:06:46,411 --> 02:06:46,850
deep.
Well,

2821
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:52,100
it's because they want people to be able
to define themselves and I agree with 

2822
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:53,020
that man.
Of course,

2823
02:06:53,050 --> 02:06:58,050
whatever you want,
but when you're getting mad at people 

2824
02:06:58,050 --> 02:06:59,310
saying gay slurs used,
you know the term queer.

2825
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,330
Well,
yeah,

2826
02:07:00,331 --> 02:07:01,080
no,
you're right man.

2827
02:07:01,081 --> 02:07:04,320
It's all fucking intention to like 
what's behind there.

2828
02:07:04,350 --> 02:07:06,420
If there's anger behind it,
it's an ugly word.

2829
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:11,070
It's why a black people can call you 
niggers.

2830
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:13,050
Hey,
is what it is.

2831
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:18,320
You know,
you know when you hear two bucks site 

2832
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:21,530
sitting around shooting the shit with Dr
Dre and they're being funny with each 

2833
02:07:21,530 --> 02:07:21,530
other.
Yeah.

2834
02:07:21,530 --> 02:07:25,850
It's not offensive.
Some old man is yelling at a young kid 

2835
02:07:25,850 --> 02:07:29,900
because he's walking on his lawn.
Then it becomes offensive and 

2836
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:32,900
dehumanizing.
I meant obviously I met a beautiful 

2837
02:07:32,900 --> 02:07:34,360
black girl the other day about trying.
It was sop.

2838
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:35,920
It's on my list,
but I,

2839
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,140
I.
It was my friend's sister,

2840
02:07:38,141 --> 02:07:40,720
but she was just so beautiful to get in 
shape for that first.

2841
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:44,950
Now you always start off with at your 
worst,

2842
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:48,310
start off with your worst presentation 
and if they accept you at that,

2843
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:50,650
really you don't ever try to impress a 
girl.

2844
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:51,820
Never.
That's bullshit.

2845
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:53,290
When you got dumped the first time,
dude,

2846
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:58,291
you lost like 70 pounds.
That's when you really realize how to 

2847
02:07:58,291 --> 02:07:58,330
get back in the game.
That was because I was out of,

2848
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:03,190
it was a seven year relationship.
That was internet fame,

2849
02:08:03,191 --> 02:08:04,210
Sun.
That's what it was.

2850
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:09,570
That the Internet fame.
You weren't the producer of a very 

2851
02:08:09,570 --> 02:08:09,790
famous podcast.
Brian,

2852
02:08:09,791 --> 02:08:12,070
how many penthouse pat have you dated?
Seven.

2853
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:13,600
Seven.
That's normal dude.

2854
02:08:13,601 --> 02:08:15,700
The guy was like,
you'll usually get a lot of penthouse,

2855
02:08:15,701 --> 02:08:17,440
but seriously,
how many?

2856
02:08:17,770 --> 02:08:18,480
Uh,
too.

2857
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:22,990
I finally did it to girls in the 
industry ever clean industry.

2858
02:08:23,370 --> 02:08:24,710
Well,
you know,

2859
02:08:25,590 --> 02:08:29,830
since I've been at Hollywood a bit on 
the industry part of the industry,

2860
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:31,110
really,
uh,

2861
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:36,170
I do a lot of industry things.
I've been history newsletter that I 

2862
02:08:36,170 --> 02:08:37,090
subscribed to day.
What's happening with that condom thing?

2863
02:08:37,091 --> 02:08:38,800
Man?
Is it fucking up the industry?

2864
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:44,580
Seems to be a lot of talk that they're 
going to move to Arizona or something 

2865
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:46,500
like that or vegas that it's going to 
move to Vegas,

2866
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:50,560
which is a lot of,
well not really because I think a lot of

2867
02:08:50,561 --> 02:08:55,561
girls live in vegas anyway because a lot
of them they make money dancing as well 

2868
02:08:55,561 --> 02:08:56,220
as doing movies.
You know,

2869
02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:01,320
they can,
if they like announced like the thing 

2870
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:04,120
they announced,
they do feature dancing and people like 

2871
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:04,510
dudes are fucking fans.
Have some porn stars.

2872
02:09:04,511 --> 02:09:07,630
Me made states may say it's kind of 
weird and strange,

2873
02:09:07,631 --> 02:09:08,530
but why is it.

2874
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:09,310
I mean,
look,

2875
02:09:09,311 --> 02:09:12,080
if you're a fan of an actress,
you know,

2876
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:15,130
you come to see her at a book signing,
you know,

2877
02:09:15,170 --> 02:09:20,170
you're,
you're a fan of the way of sucks dicks 

2878
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:20,620
and she's nice enough to let you watch 
her suck a lot of Dick's beautiful women

2879
02:09:20,621 --> 02:09:24,520
and then you pretend that it's your and,
and you blast all over yourself.

2880
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:25,170
Dude.
You know what's wrong with that?

2881
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:28,390
Beautiful women is beautiful.
Like the Pamela Anderson right there.

2882
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:30,610
I think she is gorgeous.
You know that.

2883
02:09:30,611 --> 02:09:32,800
I think that is A.
I think she is beautiful in that.

2884
02:09:32,830 --> 02:09:33,970
Yeah,
that's like art.

2885
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:38,560
So there's a certain art in what she 
looks like her body.

2886
02:09:38,561 --> 02:09:40,690
It's so.
It's so sexually arousing.

2887
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:43,510
You know,
you look at her perfectly manicured toes

2888
02:09:43,511 --> 02:09:46,750
and her toe ring and Oh,
you just want to lick her button.

2889
02:09:46,751 --> 02:09:48,400
That's right there.
Right word.

2890
02:09:48,401 --> 02:09:49,680
You're obsessed with that button.

2891
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:52,300
Yeah,
it's placed perfectly.

2892
02:09:52,301 --> 02:09:54,780
I want to dumb luck.
Look,

2893
02:09:54,781 --> 02:09:59,781
see the.
They'd line up on the other side of her 

2894
02:09:59,781 --> 02:09:59,781
shirt.
I think it's just the way it is.

2895
02:09:59,781 --> 02:10:00,040
It's just a hot picture.
The pictures,

2896
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:01,810
by the way,
I didn't create this right here.

2897
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:03,040
You know,
it's unfortunate though,

2898
02:10:03,041 --> 02:10:08,041
man.
What's unfortunate is that women like 

2899
02:10:08,041 --> 02:10:10,711
that man,
especially if they're not like heavy 

2900
02:10:10,711 --> 02:10:12,820
duty into working out instead of get 
older and they lose their body,

2901
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:14,770
they become creepy.
Look,

2902
02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:17,890
we tried to kill her ass.
They asked disappears.

2903
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:22,920
That's when it gets really weird when 
you see like older women their asses 

2904
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:24,670
like sink and turn under,
you know,

2905
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:28,210
and old men to like.
They get that Larry King Body where the.

2906
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:31,780
There's no muscle tone going on and when
a woman becomes.

2907
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:34,040
When a woman goes from Pamela Anderson

2908
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,960
and she's still attractive,
she hasn't hit this yet,

2909
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:37,740
but it's coming,
you know,

2910
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:41,720
unless she figures out some way to do a 
lot of fucking squats and keep her body.

2911
02:10:41,721 --> 02:10:46,721
Like when you become a woman who has 
enormous artificial boobs and your 

2912
02:10:47,901 --> 02:10:52,901
body's kind of falling apart and you 
have these big bags sitting in front 

2913
02:10:52,901 --> 02:10:55,170
pushing out your shirt and you know this
cleavage that you're,

2914
02:10:55,310 --> 02:11:00,310
but it's been sun drenched for so long,
it's got this weird sort of leathery 

2915
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:05,081
texture,
new trying to tone that down with heavy 

2916
02:11:05,081 --> 02:11:08,051
doses of moisturizer so your tits are 
always greasy and leathery at the same 

2917
02:11:08,051 --> 02:11:10,730
time and your is of habit rating.
So he tried to stick it out a little.

2918
02:11:10,731 --> 02:11:15,731
So you're wearing high heel shoes where 
it's really not appropriate and they're 

2919
02:11:15,731 --> 02:11:16,240
really high and you know,
you're,

2920
02:11:16,241 --> 02:11:18,980
you're awkward,
you can barely walk and you really,

2921
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:19,570
your,
your,

2922
02:11:19,571 --> 02:11:20,510
your ass has gone.

2923
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:22,830
You become a monster.
You become a stranger on the news.

2924
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:26,680
There's going to be like this wave of 
suicides from people as well.

2925
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:28,580
That's a weird thing,
man.

2926
02:11:28,581 --> 02:11:30,020
It's a weird look,
you know?

2927
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:30,500
Well,
yeah,

2928
02:11:30,501 --> 02:11:31,550
it's weird.
It's,

2929
02:11:31,551 --> 02:11:33,350
that's getting attached to your 
physical,

2930
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:36,230
to your physical body and using that as 
your main tool.

2931
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:38,330
Sure.
I think dangerous proposition,

2932
02:11:38,331 --> 02:11:40,080
man.
I think I'm you.

2933
02:11:40,130 --> 02:11:45,130
That's a really easy to say though,
when you're a girl and you look like 

2934
02:11:45,130 --> 02:11:45,130
Pamela Anderson.
Dude,

2935
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,820
first of all,
when she was young,

2936
02:11:46,821 --> 02:11:49,720
she was so hot.
That's all anyone eat.

2937
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:54,470
Probably comment all the time.
Time when she was young,

2938
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:58,310
all the people that she met,
I guarantee you everyone was just,

2939
02:11:58,311 --> 02:12:00,290
holy shit.
You're so pretty.

2940
02:12:00,291 --> 02:12:01,730
Yeah.
But that happens.

2941
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:03,490
But it wasn't what,
uh,

2942
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:07,100
when a girl gets addicted and gets 
caught up in that,

2943
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:12,130
it's almost like there's nothing that 
can match the kind of power and energy 

2944
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:12,860
she gets just from her own looks.

2945
02:12:13,310 --> 02:12:15,260
So she's almost,
it's almost like,

2946
02:12:15,261 --> 02:12:20,261
it's just,
it was too alluring to just run with 

2947
02:12:20,261 --> 02:12:20,261
that too many people were encouraging 
her,

2948
02:12:20,261 --> 02:12:25,000
you know,
and essentially she got away with 

2949
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:25,100
without doing any porn except for that 
one accidental time.

2950
02:12:25,450 --> 02:12:25,980
Yeah,
man.

2951
02:12:25,981 --> 02:12:27,170
Have a good one too though.
Yeah,

2952
02:12:27,171 --> 02:12:29,520
she did like some playboys and stuff,
you know,

2953
02:12:29,521 --> 02:12:31,660
where you got to see her naked and that 
was satisfying enough.

2954
02:12:31,661 --> 02:12:34,310
But I mean she made a living.
She was so hot.

2955
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:37,580
She made a living off being hot and 
that's what she did.

2956
02:12:38,330 --> 02:12:41,080
What sad is when people.
It does,

2957
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:43,580
I mean it's not her fault that she was 
super fucking hot.

2958
02:12:43,581 --> 02:12:46,100
It's incredible,
but the sad thing is if she was attached

2959
02:12:46,101 --> 02:12:48,310
to that perception of herself,
it's a.

2960
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:51,860
we're just assuming.
We're just assuming now that she's maybe

2961
02:12:51,861 --> 02:12:56,861
she's super cool.
She sat her down and had a conversation 

2962
02:12:56,861 --> 02:12:56,861
whether you would really enjoy it.

2963
02:12:56,861 --> 02:12:58,010
I don't know her.
She's all.

2964
02:12:58,011 --> 02:12:59,420
I'm.
All I'm saying is positive.

2965
02:12:59,421 --> 02:13:03,680
All I'm saying is that she was so 
ridiculously hot when she was young that

2966
02:13:03,681 --> 02:13:07,760
I think almost anybody would have been 
corrupted by that kind of beauty and not

2967
02:13:07,761 --> 02:13:09,580
that she even was,
but I mean I don't.

2968
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:14,640
I don't know how you could not be a 
professional hot chick if you were that 

2969
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:14,640
pretty.
Look at her dude.

2970
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:16,250
Look at her.
That's from whatever that is.

2971
02:13:16,251 --> 02:13:21,251
That's her prime.
Just like one of the hottest chicks 

2972
02:13:21,251 --> 02:13:21,251
that's ever walked the face of the 
earth.

2973
02:13:21,251 --> 02:13:24,860
I pulled back.
I think that's actually a reasonable 

2974
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:24,860
back into see your whole body.
Do you see your whole body?

2975
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:25,730
They're run,
so you get that whole thing there,

2976
02:13:25,731 --> 02:13:27,620
man.
It's a recent poster.

2977
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:30,830
Well then she still came to it together.
Good for her.

2978
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:32,910
That chick is hot as fuck.

2979
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:35,070
Great.
That's incredibly hot,

2980
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:36,390
right?
Well,

2981
02:13:36,391 --> 02:13:39,000
I think when you're that pretty.
I think you know you have.

2982
02:13:39,001 --> 02:13:44,001
We all have to be reasonable.
That girl got some crazy lottery ticket 

2983
02:13:44,001 --> 02:13:44,220
and she decided to cash it in.
She,

2984
02:13:44,221 --> 02:13:46,390
she ran.
She ran the dyson.

2985
02:13:46,391 --> 02:13:48,450
She came up double seven in the looks 
department.

2986
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:51,060
I don't fault chicks for doing that.
I don't either.

2987
02:13:51,061 --> 02:13:51,490
Man.
That's.

2988
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:53,490
I wasn't saying that at all.
Some people do,

2989
02:13:53,491 --> 02:13:58,491
right?
Some people like immediately they will 

2990
02:13:58,491 --> 02:14:00,450
discount somebody if they are a a,
a professional hot check or if they're a

2991
02:14:00,451 --> 02:14:05,451
girl who's attractive like immediately 
because they know it's so easy to be 

2992
02:14:05,451 --> 02:14:06,780
that person.
Life is so easy.

2993
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:08,640
What are the odds of you have been 
thinking?

2994
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:13,850
What are the.
What are the odds that you've been 

2995
02:14:13,850 --> 02:14:13,850
contemplating your existence?
Why would you?

2996
02:14:13,850 --> 02:14:18,000
Life is so easy.
Everyone is just tripping over 

2997
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,151
themselves to try to give you things,
but I've met plenty of them that do and 

2998
02:14:20,151 --> 02:14:22,200
those girls are insane for sure.

2999
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:28,900
It's amazing when you run into someone 
who's in his beautiful and intelligent 

3000
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:30,030
with great personality,
great sense of humor.

3001
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:31,320
It's amazing.
It's like,

3002
02:14:31,321 --> 02:14:36,321
wow,
you're looking at you here because to 

3003
02:14:36,321 --> 02:14:38,241
get to that point,
you had to have some humility that 

3004
02:14:38,241 --> 02:14:40,611
didn't come from looking in the mirror.
The reaction that you're getting from 

3005
02:14:40,611 --> 02:14:40,611
the people around you.
That could be that.

3006
02:14:40,611 --> 02:14:42,390
Some of them,
it's just simply that they,

3007
02:14:42,391 --> 02:14:45,120
you know,
they got into yoga or that got into some

3008
02:14:45,121 --> 02:14:48,900
sort of meditation discipline and they 
sort of formed.

3009
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:53,930
I mean,
it could have been the way they were 

3010
02:14:53,930 --> 02:14:53,930
raised.
They just sort of formed a,

3011
02:14:53,930 --> 02:14:55,380
a human personality instead of a hot 
chick personality.

3012
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:57,900
That's the best.
It must be hard though,

3013
02:14:57,901 --> 02:15:02,901
man.
Being a hot check must be like the 

3014
02:15:02,901 --> 02:15:03,420
easiest way to get by in life,
skate through a bunch of,

3015
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:04,880
stumbling over that.

3016
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:08,560
Also though,
if there's a lot of sadness to that life

3017
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:10,140
for some.
Sure.

3018
02:15:10,141 --> 02:15:10,680
Yeah.
Well,

3019
02:15:10,681 --> 02:15:12,220
there's also when,
when,

3020
02:15:12,221 --> 02:15:14,670
when someone feels like they're getting 
scammed over,

3021
02:15:14,730 --> 02:15:16,170
like you don't really like,
um,

3022
02:15:16,530 --> 02:15:17,520
you know,
if,

3023
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:20,130
if,
if someone's in a situation where a girl

3024
02:15:20,131 --> 02:15:22,200
is using her,
looks to get by in life,

3025
02:15:22,590 --> 02:15:26,820
the guy who is taking advantage of that,
the guys who get with those girls,

3026
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:29,790
they know,
they know that this isn't a real,

3027
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:34,820
this isn't a real love,
this is a real love under certain 

3028
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:36,630
conditions and that certain conditions 
are you're here to provide like finances

3029
02:15:36,631 --> 02:15:41,631
or pay for things or something.
There's something that those guys are 

3030
02:15:41,631 --> 02:15:44,541
going to present that.
So that manipulative relationship is 

3031
02:15:44,541 --> 02:15:47,961
never the real relationship where you 
really both truly love each other and 

3032
02:15:47,961 --> 02:15:50,160
you can't wait to see that person.
It's always this weird,

3033
02:15:50,161 --> 02:15:53,940
creepy deal where you know you're 
getting fucked and you want to check her

3034
02:15:53,941 --> 02:15:58,941
cell phone because you don't like to 
wear a [inaudible] trainer looks at you 

3035
02:15:58,941 --> 02:15:59,580
when you say hi to her at the gym.

3036
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,240
He thinks she might be fucking are 
trained.

3037
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:02,440
Man.
It was crazy.

3038
02:16:02,441 --> 02:16:04,230
And so imagine if you were like some old
dude,

3039
02:16:04,231 --> 02:16:09,231
you're like 80 years old and you get 
yourself a 30 year old chippy and she 

3040
02:16:09,231 --> 02:16:09,231
likes to work out,
you know,

3041
02:16:09,231 --> 02:16:10,560
and you,
you're playing golf.

3042
02:16:10,561 --> 02:16:15,561
And she walked in and she's like getting
stretched out by this fucking 25 year 

3043
02:16:15,691 --> 02:16:18,180
old trainer.
She's got her leg on his shoulders.

3044
02:16:18,181 --> 02:16:20,130
A lot of dudes who do creepy shit like 
that.

3045
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:21,210
All right,
time to stretch out.

3046
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:23,040
So we're going to do here.
I want to pick your leg up.

3047
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:24,690
You gotta put it on my shoulder.
Hey fuck head.

3048
02:16:24,691 --> 02:16:26,730
You don't have to do that stupid are 
you?

3049
02:16:26,731 --> 02:16:29,440
You could stretch all those major muscle
groups on the ground.

3050
02:16:29,441 --> 02:16:30,310
You'd dump.
Fuck.

3051
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:32,620
But there's a lot of dudes who like do 
creepy shit with girls.

3052
02:16:32,621 --> 02:16:37,621
All right,
well it really lean both your arms back 

3053
02:16:37,621 --> 02:16:38,470
and they'd get a nice firm sexual grip 
on their forearms.

3054
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:41,140
So just to let a woman feel the grip 
strength,

3055
02:16:41,141 --> 02:16:43,270
you know what I'm talking about?
And they just pull you back,

3056
02:16:43,271 --> 02:16:48,271
pull you back at some weird,
uncomfortable sort of semi sexual 

3057
02:16:48,271 --> 02:16:51,631
positions.
Some sorta overinflated doggy style 

3058
02:16:51,631 --> 02:16:51,631
position.
You know,

3059
02:16:51,631 --> 02:16:54,430
and then you let them go and then you're
stretching out their arms and you know,

3060
02:16:54,431 --> 02:16:59,431
you're showing your own discipline,
you stretch out with them and then it's 

3061
02:16:59,431 --> 02:17:03,180
poor fucking guy's 80 years old wasn't 
going to do it.

3062
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:06,160
He just has to be happy,
I guess.

3063
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:07,420
Yeah,
he should be happy.

3064
02:17:07,421 --> 02:17:08,830
He's just let everybody fuck her and 
hope.

3065
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:11,050
Hope nobody poisons them.
Yeah,

3066
02:17:11,051 --> 02:17:16,051
that's an inevitability.
But that's the problem is they're all 

3067
02:17:16,051 --> 02:17:16,051
gonna.
They're all going to poison you,

3068
02:17:16,051 --> 02:17:20,991
man.
How many 80 year old guys who you think 

3069
02:17:20,991 --> 02:17:20,991
are dating third 30 year?
Twenty year olds right now?

3070
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:23,070
That's a really good question.
Uh,

3071
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:23,590
let's think.

3072
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:25,660
Let's,
I wonder if we could find that statistic

3073
02:17:25,661 --> 02:17:28,390
online.
That's something you would.

3074
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:33,720
Who knows man up in the hamptons and 
like monsters.

3075
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:38,980
But I really love him.
I just think he's wonderful because when

3076
02:17:38,981 --> 02:17:41,560
people enter those relationships,
they don't enter them.

3077
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:45,190
They just don't even care about his 
lungs.

3078
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:50,220
He's body is an amazing person.
His energy is so loving and you know,

3079
02:17:50,410 --> 02:17:52,270
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't want to leave his side.

3080
02:17:52,530 --> 02:17:53,900
It sounds amazing.
See,

3081
02:17:53,950 --> 02:17:58,950
I hope to grow 81 day the girls got 
diamonds on shit and she's just lying 

3082
02:17:58,950 --> 02:18:03,091
around,
murdered the animal skins and driving 

3083
02:18:03,091 --> 02:18:04,470
around in a Bentley feels like it's not 
even connected to the road.

3084
02:18:04,471 --> 02:18:06,820
I feel like you're floating on a carpet 
through the air.

3085
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:12,000
She knows he's probably only got two 
more years of life and then she gets 

3086
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,570
millions of dollars because he was in 
love with her.

3087
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:16,060
I wonder how many of those there are out
there a lot.

3088
02:18:16,150 --> 02:18:18,160
There's a lot and you know,
you could say,

3089
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:23,280
well,
if you want it to be cynical and 

3090
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:23,280
pragmatic that you know he's providing 
something.

3091
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:25,270
She's getting something out of this.
It's a good relationship.

3092
02:18:25,271 --> 02:18:30,271
He wants comfort and sex and she's 
willing to sort of give that as long as 

3093
02:18:30,271 --> 02:18:34,051
he provides a ridiculous income to her.
That's the reason why they have this 

3094
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:35,950
unbalanced relationship in the first 
place.

3095
02:18:35,951 --> 02:18:39,760
He has to be unbalanced financially to 
overcompensate for the physical,

3096
02:18:39,761 --> 02:18:42,130
unbalanced.
He has to be ridiculous on balance.

3097
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:47,340
He asked to be buying or minks and 
diamonds and then you get to stick your 

3098
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:48,380
Dick in my mouth.
I like diamonds and that's,

3099
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:51,970
that's the deal.
She has them so they could say,

3100
02:18:51,971 --> 02:18:56,971
oh,
he was using her or she was using him 

3101
02:18:56,971 --> 02:18:56,971
for his money.
Of course.

3102
02:18:56,971 --> 02:18:56,971
That's the deal.
Yes.

3103
02:18:56,971 --> 02:19:00,400
Using him for his money and he's using 
her for her great hot body.

3104
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:02,350
You're not supposed to get this when 
you're 80.

3105
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:07,860
It's essentially what you're doing is 
taking on an insane prostitution 

3106
02:19:07,860 --> 02:19:12,190
contract that you almost like,
like almost nobody could keep up with.

3107
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:14,680
That's the only way you can keep a hot 
chick if you're 80.

3108
02:19:15,460 --> 02:19:17,620
I mean,
it's just incredible to think of that.

3109
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:21,460
Eighty year olds can get that horny man 
if they take Viagra.

3110
02:19:22,330 --> 02:19:24,280
And I think also if,
um,

3111
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:26,770
it's a lot of them,
it's a psychological thing.

3112
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:27,770
You know,
there's

3113
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,000
a lot of 80 year old guys that can't 
believe that they can get a 20 year old 

3114
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,340
hooker.
They probably can't even believe it.

3115
02:19:34,610 --> 02:19:37,370
And when they're alone with this,
if they can get it up still,

3116
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:42,460
oh my God,
how good must've feel to bang some 

3117
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:45,140
really hard 20 year old Russian hooker.
It's kind of fucked up because he's only

3118
02:19:45,141 --> 02:19:46,280
20.
Let's make her 23.

3119
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:49,310
Let's make it 23.
Really hot.

3120
02:19:49,311 --> 02:19:52,400
Twenty three year old Russian hooker 
who's really good at it.

3121
02:19:52,401 --> 02:19:54,980
She's really good at it.
I would just have to like you just.

3122
02:19:55,070 --> 02:20:00,070
It's the fact that underneath this 
beautiful young thing is a withered 

3123
02:20:00,070 --> 02:20:03,701
Chris that's about to go feed the worms.
It's like it would be tough for me to 

3124
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:06,890
beat that out of my mind as I stared at 
her,

3125
02:20:07,370 --> 02:20:08,720
at her,
at her hot body.

3126
02:20:08,721 --> 02:20:09,740
I would still be like,
man,

3127
02:20:09,741 --> 02:20:10,280
you're fucking.

3128
02:20:10,290 --> 02:20:15,290
You're wrinkling and you can barely 
breathe and your knees or to so good.

3129
02:20:17,930 --> 02:20:22,930
God damn this feel so good.
You can come in her mouth.

3130
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:24,650
You can come in around whatever you 
want.

3131
02:20:24,651 --> 02:20:26,150
She doesn't care.
What do you want to come?

3132
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:28,940
Whether you want to come.
She said he's.

3133
02:20:29,380 --> 02:20:30,260
He's healthy.
Oh Man.

3134
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:34,970
More power to him,
but he should give up his whole empire.

3135
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,520
He's not gonna live very long anyway.
Just keep it all up.

3136
02:20:37,670 --> 02:20:38,420
Yeah,
I think it's.

3137
02:20:38,421 --> 02:20:39,860
I mean,
I think that situation,

3138
02:20:39,861 --> 02:20:41,770
there certainly is something for.
Dude,

3139
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:44,960
that's priceless.
That's worth a lot of goddamn money.

3140
02:20:44,990 --> 02:20:45,740
Yeah.
A girl,

3141
02:20:45,741 --> 02:20:50,741
a really hot check to just fuck you 
whenever you want and you're an 80 year 

3142
02:20:50,741 --> 02:20:52,250
old man.
You better be paying that bitch.

3143
02:20:52,610 --> 02:20:55,250
That's a ridiculous thing to ask.
You think it's tough to ask them to be a

3144
02:20:55,251 --> 02:21:00,251
garbage man.
How about asking a fucking old guy 

3145
02:21:00,251 --> 02:21:00,251
whenever he wants?

3146
02:21:00,251 --> 02:21:03,500
You think there's any like 80 year old.
Do you think there's any 80 year old 

3147
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:04,940
guys living in studio apartments that 
have 30 year old girlfriends?

3148
02:21:06,150 --> 02:21:07,730
No.
No,

3149
02:21:07,731 --> 02:21:11,300
there's none of that doesn't exist.
Maybe there might be a few broken chicks

3150
02:21:11,301 --> 02:21:14,570
out there that you got roped into some 
bad poetry or something like that.

3151
02:21:15,490 --> 02:21:18,200
It's possible.
Most guys though,

3152
02:21:19,070 --> 02:21:22,570
roped in the back.
Some guy pretends to be good.

3153
02:21:22,580 --> 02:21:27,580
You've been lost girl and you know he's 
a information he has no.

3154
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:32,650
He takes time with her and something no 
one ever did and he has needs and she 

3155
02:21:32,650 --> 02:21:34,190
takes care of it for them.
That's possible most of the time.

3156
02:21:34,191 --> 02:21:39,191
Not Likely.
Most of the time it's a motherfucker 

3157
02:21:39,191 --> 02:21:42,581
that's living in some shit that nobody 
should be living in some crazy fucking 

3158
02:21:42,581 --> 02:21:43,430
castle.
There's some.

3159
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:43,950
I,
I,

3160
02:21:44,060 --> 02:21:49,060
every now and then as a goof,
I like to go on a website and look at 

3161
02:21:49,060 --> 02:21:50,330
like stupid expensive houses that are 
for sale.

3162
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:52,540
Like what is the most expensive house 
you could buy,

3163
02:21:52,710 --> 02:21:56,060
like $20,
million dollar houses and you can go and

3164
02:21:56,061 --> 02:22:01,061
look at the pictures of them.
They show them online and you see the 

3165
02:22:01,061 --> 02:22:03,521
grounds and everything like holy shit,
like what is this crazy way that one 

3166
02:22:03,521 --> 02:22:05,540
person gets to live?
This is nuts.

3167
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:08,510
I looked at this one house,
it was a compound.

3168
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:14,110
It was absolutely insane.
It was 600 plus acres and this 

3169
02:22:14,110 --> 02:22:18,851
incredible fucking house.
And I mean it was one of the most 

3170
02:22:18,851 --> 02:22:22,150
extravagant things that a person could 
ever purchase an urn and own in their 

3171
02:22:22,150 --> 02:22:26,891
life.
They essentially own a kingdom was 

3172
02:22:26,891 --> 02:22:26,891
really like a 650 acre

3173
02:22:26,891 --> 02:22:28,160
kingdom.
And uh,

3174
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:28,810
you know,
no,

3175
02:22:28,811 --> 02:22:31,320
it was a little chippy.
She's 26,

3176
02:22:31,321 --> 02:22:34,340
she just came here from Czechoslovakia 
and uh,

3177
02:22:34,350 --> 02:22:38,070
you know,
we started hanging out man and she likes

3178
02:22:38,071 --> 02:22:43,071
to smoke weed.
I still smoke a little weed every now 

3179
02:22:43,071 --> 02:22:43,071
and then.
Next thing you know,

3180
02:22:43,071 --> 02:22:43,700
she's talking to my deck and I don't 
know what to do.

3181
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:45,840
I'm a mom.
I'm 86 years old.

3182
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:48,170
I mean,
what kind of relationship we're going to

3183
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:49,200
have.
I mean,

3184
02:22:49,201 --> 02:22:50,640
what do you think?
Should I pursue this?

3185
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:53,670
I have a walker,
a walker.

3186
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:56,600
I have a lot of 86 year olds.
Have a lot of them.

3187
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:58,750
If I want to get down the steps,
I've got a ride.

3188
02:22:58,751 --> 02:23:01,130
And what would you tell an old man who,
if there was a hunch,

3189
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:05,160
I would say you might want some people 
to fucking keep an eye on her,

3190
02:23:06,410 --> 02:23:11,410
you know,
but then you gotta make sure that you 

3191
02:23:11,410 --> 02:23:11,410
have only gay security guards because 
uh,

3192
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:13,590
that dirty bitch will suck their dicks.

3193
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:15,090
I mean,
she's really hot.

3194
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:20,450
Well no,
but I'm saying if you're a guy and you 

3195
02:23:20,450 --> 02:23:22,371
were like the super rich dude who lives 
in this giant crazy house and you're 80 

3196
02:23:22,371 --> 02:23:24,951
years old and this is 23 year old,
really hot eastern bloc chick that may 

3197
02:23:25,261 --> 02:23:30,261
or may not be an assassin as well.
A hooker and a you gotta have some gay 

3198
02:23:31,321 --> 02:23:33,780
security guards that are keeping an eye 
on her.

3199
02:23:34,020 --> 02:23:37,410
You can't have like young stud guys 
because she'll just suck their dicks,

3200
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:39,390
you know,
that dirty bitch.

3201
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:42,000
They most guys will not be able to stop 
themselves,

3202
02:23:42,110 --> 02:23:43,060
you know,
a really,

3203
02:23:43,710 --> 02:23:48,710
really fat from Iowa and never met a 
girl like that before and all of a 

3204
02:23:48,710 --> 02:23:48,710
sudden she's like,
listen,

3205
02:23:48,710 --> 02:23:50,190
relax baby,
relax.

3206
02:23:50,460 --> 02:23:51,870
And she's rubbing your balls.
Like,

3207
02:23:51,871 --> 02:23:56,871
Holy Shit,
I can't believe there's going to have a 

3208
02:23:56,871 --> 02:23:56,871
look.
I get fired for this.

3209
02:23:56,871 --> 02:24:00,740
Relax baby with that and we'll work 
something out and you know,

3210
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:02,760
she's,
you know,

3211
02:24:02,761 --> 02:24:05,370
I can fuck this old man all the time.
You know,

3212
02:24:05,371 --> 02:24:08,160
sometimes I want to go out and have fund
and we have a deal.

3213
02:24:08,480 --> 02:24:09,450
Yeah.
Next thing you know,

3214
02:24:09,451 --> 02:24:12,360
there are plotting his death.
That's what it is.

3215
02:24:12,510 --> 02:24:13,500
That's how it goes.
Dunkin.

3216
02:24:13,770 --> 02:24:15,210
And that's when he's got to be careful 
for.

3217
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:20,220
He's only have gay security guards 
should have big bad ass gay dudes that 

3218
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,770
watch over you.
That's like,

3219
02:24:21,810 --> 02:24:25,170
that's the weirdest end of your life.
And find the girl.

3220
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,090
Yeah,
you got a big.

3221
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:33,620
And at 30 year old Russian prostitute,
you gotta Gut go get those guys to take 

3222
02:24:34,951 --> 02:24:39,951
her everywhere.
They never let any guys come near her 

3223
02:24:39,951 --> 02:24:41,830
because she's mine and you don't let 
that bitch fucking poison me.

3224
02:24:43,090 --> 02:24:44,820
Just absurd.
It's just absurd,

3225
02:24:44,821 --> 02:24:46,620
man.
It's a lot of guys lives,

3226
02:24:46,621 --> 02:24:47,160
right?
Yeah.

3227
02:24:47,161 --> 02:24:49,740
Its absurdity.
It's so funny the way that you could end

3228
02:24:49,741 --> 02:24:51,490
up when you're blinking out of the 
universe,

3229
02:24:51,491 --> 02:24:56,491
like you can actually blink out of the 
universe and a silk robe next to a 30 

3230
02:24:56,581 --> 02:25:01,150
year old Russian stripper.
I know a man who was a um,

3231
02:25:01,330 --> 02:25:03,060
uh,
he was a successful man,

3232
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:05,250
but he was very,
very weak.

3233
02:25:05,400 --> 02:25:09,120
He was like very physically weak and he 
was much older than her.

3234
02:25:09,570 --> 02:25:12,710
He was about 30 years older than her,
you know,

3235
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:14,040
he was maybe.
Yeah,

3236
02:25:14,041 --> 02:25:19,041
she was like in her probably in her 
forties and he was in his seventies and 

3237
02:25:19,470 --> 02:25:24,070
there was the anger from her at him and 
the way she would yell at him

3238
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:29,070
and treat him this,
this complete total lack of respect 

3239
02:25:29,070 --> 02:25:29,560
because,
you know,

3240
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:32,320
basically they're the.
They had been married for a long time.

3241
02:25:32,350 --> 02:25:37,350
The only reason why they got married in 
the first place is because he was rich 

3242
02:25:37,350 --> 02:25:37,350
and she was hot and she learned along 
the way.

3243
02:25:37,350 --> 02:25:38,890
This motherfucker's not going to do 
nothing,

3244
02:25:38,891 --> 02:25:43,891
and the way to get them off you is to 
just yell at them and humiliate them in 

3245
02:25:43,891 --> 02:25:44,230
front of other people.
Will you fucking stop?

3246
02:25:44,380 --> 02:25:47,020
Just stop.
She was this Russian lady,

3247
02:25:47,410 --> 02:25:52,410
Judy.
She yelled at him in front of me and my 

3248
02:25:52,410 --> 02:25:53,410
friends and it was this really fucking 
super uncomfortable moment,

3249
02:25:53,411 --> 02:25:58,411
man.
Just snapped at him in front of 

3250
02:25:58,411 --> 02:25:58,420
everybody and we're like,
we had a peak at this guy's life.

3251
02:25:58,710 --> 02:25:59,190
What,
what,

3252
02:25:59,220 --> 02:25:59,900
what,
what did he,

3253
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:01,510
what did he done?
It was so bad.

3254
02:26:01,511 --> 02:26:02,170
Do you remember?
I don't know.

3255
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:03,400
Nothing.
Nothing.

3256
02:26:03,401 --> 02:26:04,660
At the time.
He was a really nice guy.

3257
02:26:04,661 --> 02:26:06,900
He was a doctor and uh,
he made,

3258
02:26:06,970 --> 02:26:08,020
made them a lot of money.
Man.

3259
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:13,050
He was rich.
He had a crazy house and crazy cars and 

3260
02:26:13,050 --> 02:26:15,760
shit and she was like a really hot 
Soviet bloc looking chick.

3261
02:26:15,970 --> 02:26:20,970
I don't remember what,
what part of what part of the Soviet 

3262
02:26:20,970 --> 02:26:20,970
Union or Russia or whatever she was 
from.

3263
02:26:20,970 --> 02:26:23,920
But it was something like that.
I don't remember Ukraine.

3264
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:24,610
She might've.
No,

3265
02:26:24,611 --> 02:26:27,230
I don't remember.
I don't remember fucking tragic dude.

3266
02:26:27,231 --> 02:26:32,231
It's so tragic and it's tragic when 
someone's with someone and that person 

3267
02:26:32,231 --> 02:26:33,330
doesn't want to be with your man or give
away,

3268
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:36,940
you know,
love and like these little like rations,

3269
02:26:37,210 --> 02:26:39,580
you know,
they give a sex and affection and little

3270
02:26:39,581 --> 02:26:40,840
rations,
you know?

3271
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:42,820
Well No,
it's like that thing they experiment.

3272
02:26:42,821 --> 02:26:43,890
They did with the monkey,
you know,

3273
02:26:43,891 --> 02:26:46,020
but it's like one of the worst 
experiments of all time.

3274
02:26:46,090 --> 02:26:51,090
They take a fucking wire monkey and 
there's those pictures of the monkeys 

3275
02:26:51,090 --> 02:26:55,210
leaning to the wire monkey in pretending
it's a real monkey on it.

3276
02:26:55,211 --> 02:27:00,211
They put carpet on it and they,
they had this poor monkey that thought 

3277
02:27:00,211 --> 02:27:01,010
it was a mama.
There was nothing else in there for it.

3278
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:06,750
But some people are in relationships 
where there that little fucking monkey 

3279
02:27:06,750 --> 02:27:11,160
and they're clinging onto nothing.
There's nothing there and they're just 

3280
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:11,800
pretending that there's love.
There's something there for them.

3281
02:27:11,801 --> 02:27:14,740
And they know in their heart there's 
nothing there and they just keep fucking

3282
02:27:14,741 --> 02:27:19,741
doing it because they're terrified to 
let go of that fucking thing and go out 

3283
02:27:19,741 --> 02:27:23,461
into the world.
It's super hard to find someone that's 

3284
02:27:23,461 --> 02:27:25,360
really cool to hang out with.
That doesn't just become a shithead.

3285
02:27:25,361 --> 02:27:29,440
Eventually someone just someone who 
doesn't fall apart after you get to know

3286
02:27:29,441 --> 02:27:30,220
them for awhile.

3287
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:32,200
Because that happens with a lot of 
people.

3288
02:27:32,201 --> 02:27:37,201
Man,
a lot of people do really good in the 

3289
02:27:37,201 --> 02:27:37,201
beginning of a relationship because they
can pretend to be someone really cool.

3290
02:27:37,201 --> 02:27:37,870
Yeah.
Right.

3291
02:27:38,110 --> 02:27:40,740
And then as time goes on you realize 
like,

3292
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:43,600
oh,
he's tired and she's a bitch,

3293
02:27:43,601 --> 02:27:44,780
man.
Why you negative to,

3294
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:46,090
you know,
you're always negative.

3295
02:27:46,091 --> 02:27:47,500
Stop it.
Yeah.

3296
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:52,590
It's really weird.
That thing when you stop acting and you 

3297
02:27:52,590 --> 02:27:54,850
ended up meeting the real person.
And that can either be.

3298
02:27:55,390 --> 02:27:57,700
Hopefully that moment should be 
wonderful.

3299
02:27:57,701 --> 02:28:00,820
Like when the fucking guard comes down 
and you really see the person,

3300
02:28:00,821 --> 02:28:03,850
there should be some beautiful thing,
but sometimes it's not.

3301
02:28:03,970 --> 02:28:08,970
Sometimes.
Or sometimes one mask comes off and 

3302
02:28:08,970 --> 02:28:08,970
there's just another one there,
but it's,

3303
02:28:08,970 --> 02:28:13,710
it's like all of us are wandering around
right now in that state that we're 

3304
02:28:13,710 --> 02:28:18,121
putting on his show,
pretending to be as they're pretending 

3305
02:28:18,121 --> 02:28:18,121
to be hoping to try to fake it till you 
make it.

3306
02:28:18,460 --> 02:28:22,400
There's some of that going on to you.
I've said

3307
02:28:22,670 --> 02:28:25,760
often on this show that my best advice 
to someone else.

3308
02:28:25,761 --> 02:28:30,761
Pretend to be the guy or be the guy 
rather that you pretend to be when 

3309
02:28:30,761 --> 02:28:32,030
you're trying to get laid.
Just be that guy.

3310
02:28:32,930 --> 02:28:34,210
Be that guy,
be that,

3311
02:28:34,230 --> 02:28:34,850
ah,
that guy.

3312
02:28:34,851 --> 02:28:36,740
When you're trying to impress a chick 
with how cool you are,

3313
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:40,310
be that guy for real CFA person know 
become the.

3314
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:43,490
Hold yourself to a higher standard.
Hold yourself to a standard.

3315
02:28:43,491 --> 02:28:46,580
That's admirable.
A lot of people just act on instinct and

3316
02:28:46,820 --> 02:28:49,730
they don't ever look at their life from 
like a point of view,

3317
02:28:49,731 --> 02:28:54,731
like,
what would I be impressed with if 

3318
02:28:54,731 --> 02:28:54,731
someone handled this?
Isn't it?

3319
02:28:54,731 --> 02:28:56,770
What would be the most moral and the 
coolest,

3320
02:28:56,790 --> 02:29:00,560
nicest thing to do here?
The most admirable thing to do and when,

3321
02:29:00,610 --> 02:29:04,340
when you become capable of doing that,
you become capable of,

3322
02:29:04,390 --> 02:29:06,410
of looking at your whole life through 
the,

3323
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:08,660
like almost an objective perspective.

3324
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:13,780
Do you,
have you ever heard of something called 

3325
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:13,780
transactional analysis or game theory?
Have you ever heard of this sort of game

3326
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:18,761
theory?
I didn't know it was transactional 

3327
02:29:18,761 --> 02:29:18,761
analysis ideas.
It's like,

3328
02:29:18,761 --> 02:29:22,601
so yeah,
it's an analysis of the transactions 

3329
02:29:22,601 --> 02:29:23,290
that happen between people.
So what they.

3330
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:23,400
Right

3331
02:29:24,210 --> 02:29:26,730
something to do with the guy from the,
uh,

3332
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:28,650
a brilliant mind.
I don't know,

3333
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:32,400
isn't it that the Nobel prize I think 
was on.

3334
02:29:32,610 --> 02:29:33,060
I'm sorry,

3335
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:38,650
I,
I'm reading a book called the Games 

3336
02:29:38,650 --> 02:29:40,740
people play and it's like an analysis of
like the basic games that we play,

3337
02:29:40,741 --> 02:29:45,741
for example,
like shaking hands is a game where the 

3338
02:29:45,741 --> 02:29:48,561
rules of the game or you're kind of like
transmitting a what I think what they 

3339
02:29:48,561 --> 02:29:50,880
call a token.
So like if I come up to you and I extend

3340
02:29:50,881 --> 02:29:55,620
my hand for you to shake my hand and you
don't shake my hand,

3341
02:29:55,830 --> 02:30:00,830
then that creates a weird moment because
you haven't made it a complete 

3342
02:30:00,830 --> 02:30:00,870
transaction.
You know what I'm saying?

3343
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:01,980
Yes,
yes.

3344
02:30:02,130 --> 02:30:07,130
So it's like it's an analysis of 
everything at that level and it just 

3345
02:30:07,130 --> 02:30:10,050
sort of comes back that we're all 
engaged in these weird games.

3346
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:11,000
Everyone,
you know,

3347
02:30:11,010 --> 02:30:16,010
whether you're acting like you're the 
greatest person on a date or whether 

3348
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:18,570
you're acting like you're some kind of 
weak person who is always broke and it's

3349
02:30:18,571 --> 02:30:23,571
always in bad relationships or whether 
you're acting like you're a priest or 

3350
02:30:23,571 --> 02:30:24,510
whether you're acting like you're 
whatever the fucking thing is.

3351
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:29,660
You're just playing a game.
You're just playing the game of being 

3352
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:29,660
this person,
you know,

3353
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:32,740
that's.
So we're all in the kind of endless,

3354
02:30:33,420 --> 02:30:37,350
absurd situation of having to pretend to
be something,

3355
02:30:37,351 --> 02:30:39,510
you know,
whatever it is like fucking waiters,

3356
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:43,470
like would it or what anyone you're 
buying anything from there having to act

3357
02:30:43,471 --> 02:30:47,160
in this weird way called professional,
but they're just acting like who is this

3358
02:30:47,161 --> 02:30:48,060
character?
It's a character.

3359
02:30:48,061 --> 02:30:49,860
You're playing a weird character of 
someone who's like,

3360
02:30:50,100 --> 02:30:50,940
thank you.
Yes.

3361
02:30:50,941 --> 02:30:54,810
May I get you another drink like tv host
or a strip club dj?

3362
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:55,980
Yeah.
Or,

3363
02:30:55,981 --> 02:30:57,930
or just almost anyone.
It's just,

3364
02:30:58,230 --> 02:31:00,510
it's just the things that people think 
are themselves.

3365
02:31:00,511 --> 02:31:05,511
This is who I am.
I love the rolling stones and I really 

3366
02:31:05,511 --> 02:31:06,150
enjoy fishing.
It's like,

3367
02:31:06,151 --> 02:31:08,130
is that really you?
That's who you are.

3368
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:12,420
That's your identity.
Because if you like get far enough back,

3369
02:31:12,421 --> 02:31:17,421
you'll realize that that's not you.
That's just a game that you're playing 

3370
02:31:17,421 --> 02:31:19,410
and you can keep going back and back and
back until you emerge and everything,

3371
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:20,160
but we.

3372
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:25,190
Nobody wants to do that.
Everybody wants to stay as the fucking 

3373
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:25,190
thing.
No one wants to.

3374
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:29,720
Everyone wants a little,
certainly comfort in predetermined 

3375
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:29,720
patterns.
You know,

3376
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:30,030
the people love to say,
listen man,

3377
02:31:30,031 --> 02:31:32,010
I'm a Republican.
I vote.

3378
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:34,590
I'm a Christian,
so I'm voting for George W.

3379
02:31:34,590 --> 02:31:35,660
he's my guy.
You know,

3380
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:38,370
people love to be part of teams.
Do that.

3381
02:31:38,390 --> 02:31:43,390
It's fun to play.
It's very difficult to back up the way 

3382
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:43,390
you're saying.
I mean,

3383
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:46,450
it's like to do it without help.
To do it without either psychedelic help

3384
02:31:46,451 --> 02:31:51,451
but to do it without some sort of 
intense meditation and Yoga and training

3385
02:31:51,541 --> 02:31:54,420
and that's like a huge.
It's a really difficult.

3386
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:56,250
It's a difficult task,
but it's the.

3387
02:31:56,280 --> 02:32:01,280
It's,
it's like if you begin to engage in 

3388
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:01,280
people are going to get better at that.
Hell yes,

3389
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:02,730
for sure.
Definitely.

3390
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:05,430
People are going to get better because 
the information is getting out there.

3391
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:10,430
There's so many information systems out 
there that back in the pool of thousands

3392
02:32:10,980 --> 02:32:12,540
of years ago,
you couldn't have books.

3393
02:32:12,541 --> 02:32:13,800
There weren't even books.
Man,

3394
02:32:13,801 --> 02:32:17,220
I was very difficult to get a book.
Books were incredibly valuable.

3395
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:20,970
Now this shit is scattered throughout 
the entire fucking planet.

3396
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:23,850
You have instantaneous access to this 
stuff.

3397
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:25,200
It's fucking.
Yeah.

3398
02:32:25,201 --> 02:32:27,030
I think people are going to learn 
profit.

3399
02:32:27,031 --> 02:32:31,200
Brendan Walsh just walked in,
which a ends ends his podcast.

3400
02:32:31,201 --> 02:32:33,150
We're going to start a new one right 
after this.

3401
02:32:33,570 --> 02:32:36,330
We're going to start the dusk squad.
Icehouse chronicles,

3402
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:38,190
because the comics are starting to pilot
for the show.

3403
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:41,220
It is already 9:30.
Yeah,

3404
02:32:41,221 --> 02:32:43,500
it was John Nash,
the guy from them,

3405
02:32:43,501 --> 02:32:48,501
when we have brilliant mind,
he did win a some sort of a Nobel prize 

3406
02:32:48,501 --> 02:32:50,640
on a game theory,
so I dunno some along those lines.

3407
02:32:50,641 --> 02:32:52,110
He went crazy.
He was a guy that went nutty.

3408
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:53,070
I didn't know he went crazy.

3409
02:32:53,230 --> 02:32:58,230
That's the movie about what it was the 
WHO's the guy who's the guy who played a

3410
02:32:59,490 --> 02:33:01,890
beautiful mind?
Gladiator.

3411
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:03,150
Russell Crowe.
Yeah.

3412
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:08,540
Brilliant performance,
and he played that guy and he went 

3413
02:33:08,540 --> 02:33:10,881
nutty,
like imagined a bunch of shit and shit 

3414
02:33:10,881 --> 02:33:10,881
to us and man,
you should check it out.

3415
02:33:10,881 --> 02:33:12,150
You love it.
It's really brought himself back.

3416
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:13,620
It's a really.
He's a fascinating story.

3417
02:33:13,621 --> 02:33:15,150
He actually brought himself back to 
reality,

3418
02:33:15,151 --> 02:33:17,570
started ignoring the voice.
He still hears voices in the head,

3419
02:33:17,730 --> 02:33:19,200
his head,
but he just ignores him now.

3420
02:33:19,440 --> 02:33:21,750
He concentrated.
He can differentiate between what's real

3421
02:33:21,751 --> 02:33:25,650
and what's not and so he stayed saying,
even in the midst of twirling and Santa,

3422
02:33:25,690 --> 02:33:29,040
he managed to figure out how to like how
to maintain it.

3423
02:33:29,100 --> 02:33:29,850
That's cool.
Yeah.

3424
02:33:29,851 --> 02:33:32,310
That's when everything really fast time 
figuring out how to maintain that.

3425
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:34,590
She's a really fascinating case.
Really Interesting Guy,

3426
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:36,060
a brilliant,
brilliant guy.

3427
02:33:36,130 --> 02:33:37,060
Who's who,
who,

3428
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:39,690
who went mad and brought himself back 
really nuts.

3429
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:41,580
Um,
that's it.

3430
02:33:41,581 --> 02:33:43,430
Those are 200 podcasts,
ladies,

3431
02:33:43,470 --> 02:33:48,470
gentlemen,
all you freaks people out there at the 

3432
02:33:48,470 --> 02:33:52,221
gym.
All you people out there driving cross 

3433
02:33:52,221 --> 02:33:52,880
country and sitting on trains and doing 
whatever the fuck you're doing.

3434
02:33:52,881 --> 02:33:57,881
A porch swing where we're,
we're so happy that you tuned into the 

3435
02:33:57,881 --> 02:33:57,881
show.
We'd love doing it.

3436
02:33:57,881 --> 02:33:57,900
We're happy.
You guys love it.

3437
02:33:58,170 --> 02:34:02,340
And I feel like you guys are some of the
coolest,

3438
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:06,630
most positive people that I've ever come
across on the Internet.

3439
02:34:06,631 --> 02:34:08,040
I think it's a,
it's an amazing,

3440
02:34:08,970 --> 02:34:13,970
it's an amazing moment when we've 
collected so many really cool and 

3441
02:34:14,461 --> 02:34:19,461
friendly and fun people that follow us.
If you think about the amount of 

3442
02:34:19,461 --> 02:34:19,461
negative

3443
02:34:19,461 --> 02:34:20,290
tweets that you get,
an amount of negative shit that you get,

3444
02:34:20,530 --> 02:34:25,090
it's so small in relationship to how 
many cool people there are out there.

3445
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:29,410
How many cool stories you get tweeted,
funny things,

3446
02:34:29,710 --> 02:34:30,160
you know,
uh,

3447
02:34:30,161 --> 02:34:33,730
answers to questions.
I think we're super,

3448
02:34:33,731 --> 02:34:34,690
super lucky,
man.

3449
02:34:34,930 --> 02:34:39,930
You know,
I think we're putting out a cool vibe 

3450
02:34:39,930 --> 02:34:42,390
and I think we're putting out an in an 
honest way of looking at the world and 

3451
02:34:42,390 --> 02:34:46,321
people are responding and we're 
responding back and it's the most fun 

3452
02:34:46,321 --> 02:34:49,651
I've ever had to accommodate.
It's the most fun I've ever had doing 

3453
02:34:49,651 --> 02:34:49,651
anything,
you know,

3454
02:34:49,651 --> 02:34:50,350
that you would call like,
like in show business,

3455
02:34:50,490 --> 02:34:52,270
this thing is the most fun for sure.
For sure.

3456
02:34:52,330 --> 02:34:54,100
And it's the most honest.
It's the most.

3457
02:34:54,101 --> 02:34:55,750
I mean it's just,
it is what it is,

3458
02:34:55,751 --> 02:34:57,730
man.
There's no preparation,

3459
02:34:57,760 --> 02:34:59,910
you know,
and it's,

3460
02:35:00,050 --> 02:35:04,300
it's is as open and as honest as we are 
capable of.

3461
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:05,600
And I think,
um,

3462
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:07,990
I think that helps us.
I know it helps me.

3463
02:35:07,991 --> 02:35:10,540
I know these conversations have been 
huge for,

3464
02:35:10,750 --> 02:35:15,750
for breaking things down for me and just
kind of reassembling the way I look at 

3465
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:16,990
the world,
you know,

3466
02:35:16,991 --> 02:35:18,990
and having all these different guests on
and have it,

3467
02:35:18,991 --> 02:35:23,991
all these different people and all these
really different intelligent people and 

3468
02:35:23,991 --> 02:35:26,380
really intense opinions and it's super,
super beneficial man.

3469
02:35:26,381 --> 02:35:29,470
And I'm just so happy that we're able to
do this.

3470
02:35:29,471 --> 02:35:31,300
I is the fucking coolest thing I've ever
done.

3471
02:35:31,301 --> 02:35:32,350
I really,
really enjoy it.

3472
02:35:32,660 --> 02:35:34,660
I enjoy it.
It's almost right up there with standup.

3473
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:38,440
Standup will always be like the sacred 
top of the food chain,

3474
02:35:39,310 --> 02:35:40,960
but it's pretty close to it.
It's really cool.

3475
02:35:41,110 --> 02:35:46,110
And the reason why it's cool is how many
cool people it impacts and how many cool

3476
02:35:46,331 --> 02:35:50,680
people who had impacts share their love 
with us and send that love back at us.

3477
02:35:50,680 --> 02:35:55,680
And we appreciate the fuck out of it.
We talk about it all the time and we 

3478
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:57,940
just want you to know we love all your 
dirty bitches.

3479
02:35:59,610 --> 02:36:02,050
Thank you to the flashlight for keeping 
it real.

3480
02:36:02,110 --> 02:36:07,110
Staying with us since the beginning 
where it was ridiculous that anybody 

3481
02:36:07,110 --> 02:36:07,720
would give us money for this stupid 
fucking show.

3482
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:12,990
If you started today,
this is the first episode the ever 

3483
02:36:12,990 --> 02:36:15,841
downloaded.
Don't download episode one because it's 

3484
02:36:15,841 --> 02:36:17,410
fucking terrible.
Don't down to,

3485
02:36:17,411 --> 02:36:22,411
I think to.
I run out of the room and three or four 

3486
02:36:22,411 --> 02:36:22,411
times and take a shit.
I got diarrhea.

3487
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:23,780
Um,
but uh,

3488
02:36:24,380 --> 02:36:26,260
it didn't get good for awhile.
So,

3489
02:36:26,261 --> 02:36:26,960
uh,
it,

3490
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:27,750
it,
you know,

3491
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:32,860
we never publicize this thing and it 
sort of just built up on itself 

3492
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:33,730
naturally and we love it.
We couldn't be happier.

3493
02:36:33,731 --> 02:36:38,731
I just,
I've always wanted to have a radio show 

3494
02:36:38,731 --> 02:36:38,731
and I never could get anybody to even 
think about giving me one,

3495
02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:43,960
you know,
and I really want to get up every 

3496
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:43,960
morning either.

3497
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:43,960
So this is perfect.
Perfect.

3498
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:44,320
Perfect.
No middleman,

3499
02:36:44,380 --> 02:36:46,660
right to the people in Atlanta.
Uh,

3500
02:36:46,690 --> 02:36:51,690
tickets are sold out,
I believe for the first show at the 

3501
02:36:51,690 --> 02:36:52,190
Tabernacle on April 20th.
Um,

3502
02:36:52,210 --> 02:36:57,210
but there's still some tickets available
for the second show and that is where 

3503
02:36:57,210 --> 02:37:00,010
I'm going to be filling my next special.
I'm fucking super pumped about this.

3504
02:37:00,011 --> 02:37:02,140
This is for real,
the best shit I've ever done.

3505
02:37:02,690 --> 02:37:05,800
I've been doing a lot of standup lately.
I'm in the groove,

3506
02:37:05,801 --> 02:37:08,530
like we had a great time this weekend at
the county of Magic Club.

3507
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:13,950
That place is so beautiful.
And then this weekend we're in 

3508
02:37:13,950 --> 02:37:15,410
Louisville at the Improv all weekend,
Friday,

3509
02:37:15,410 --> 02:37:16,060
Saturday and Sunday.
And they're supposedly

3510
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:21,070
some crazy basketball thing.
Like it might be a huge problem with no 

3511
02:37:21,070 --> 02:37:22,400
one's gonna want to come to the show was
going to be crazy.

3512
02:37:22,401 --> 02:37:25,340
It's going to be.
I've been worn 19 times on twitter about

3513
02:37:25,341 --> 02:37:30,341
this event.
They said I should put a TV onstage 

3514
02:37:30,341 --> 02:37:31,550
while the game is on and allow people to
watch it while we talk.

3515
02:37:31,580 --> 02:37:33,080
I'm totally cool with that.
Really.

3516
02:37:33,081 --> 02:37:34,570
I think it would be fun.
Fucking blast.

3517
02:37:34,750 --> 02:37:36,740
I think it'd be fun.
I think it'd be fun.

3518
02:37:37,220 --> 02:37:42,220
It'd be fun because I don't know what 
the fuck is going on and I want them to 

3519
02:37:42,220 --> 02:37:42,750
stop this nonsense game.
We please do that.

3520
02:37:43,630 --> 02:37:44,810
Yeah,
we could totally do that.

3521
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:45,950
Can totally do that.
Yeah,

3522
02:37:45,951 --> 02:37:47,810
because I think that'll help people come
to the show too.

3523
02:37:47,811 --> 02:37:49,520
If so,
if the Improv can figure that out,

3524
02:37:49,521 --> 02:37:51,560
we'll do that poster Joe.
Yeah.

3525
02:37:51,561 --> 02:37:51,860
Yeah.

3526
02:37:52,070 --> 02:37:54,770
We'll tell people about it too,
because most of the people listening.

3527
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:56,390
Oh yeah,
so I got this.

3528
02:37:57,110 --> 02:38:02,110
I've had this poster made,
which is I'm only making 666 of them and

3529
02:38:03,201 --> 02:38:06,200
they're these giant posters,
these incredible,

3530
02:38:06,201 --> 02:38:08,750
awesome posters that Joe just in 
mcalester,

3531
02:38:08,751 --> 02:38:12,740
this amazing artists made of me getting 
possessed by my satanic puppet.

3532
02:38:13,130 --> 02:38:14,520
As you could see,
this is it.

3533
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:18,890
Once we get 666 cities through all the 
homes in America,

3534
02:38:19,010 --> 02:38:22,370
they will make a chaos vortex and the 
senior clarity will happen.

3535
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:27,520
So please purchase one of these posters.
If I need one signed done deal.

3536
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:31,130
I'm tempted to give you six,
six,

3537
02:38:31,131 --> 02:38:31,840
six,
six,

3538
02:38:31,870 --> 02:38:32,440
six,
six.

3539
02:38:32,450 --> 02:38:34,010
I'll take it.
I'll take it.

3540
02:38:34,250 --> 02:38:36,420
That's a good lucky number for me.
Um,

3541
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:39,260
that's it to,
to the end of listen,

3542
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:42,710
you guys have been cool as fuck.
You've been with us.

3543
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:45,070
Some of you from the very beginning.
And uh,

3544
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:46,550
that's,
that's ridiculous.

3545
02:38:46,551 --> 02:38:48,410
I can't believe you stuck out this long.
Crazy.

3546
02:38:48,470 --> 02:38:50,990
And we can't believe how many people 
enjoy the show.

3547
02:38:50,991 --> 02:38:53,240
We love doing it and there's nothing 
more I can say.

3548
02:38:53,850 --> 02:38:55,310
I know Brian feels the same way.

3549
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:57,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

3550
02:38:58,110 --> 02:38:58,710
It's sweet.

3551
02:38:59,460 --> 02:39:00,330
Well,
what is it like to you?

3552
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:01,800
I mean,
it was our 200th episode,

3553
02:39:01,801 --> 02:39:03,360
Dude,
just tell these people how it feels.

3554
02:39:03,710 --> 02:39:08,710
It's a lot of talking about stuff that 
happens in your life and now you know us

3555
02:39:09,441 --> 02:39:11,390
more than better.
My friend Shane,

3556
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:12,810
a green,
he had it.

3557
02:39:13,100 --> 02:39:15,380
He's having a baby today.
He knows.

3558
02:39:15,381 --> 02:39:20,381
He's like my best friend.
You guys at home know me way more than 

3559
02:39:20,381 --> 02:39:24,050
he knows me and he's talking on the 
podcast like,

3560
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:27,740
you know more about all of us that and 
it's freaky as fuck.

3561
02:39:28,250 --> 02:39:30,410
But what's also cool is,
you know,

3562
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:31,910
it feels like you're.
I mean,

3563
02:39:31,911 --> 02:39:34,460
you know me better than my best friend.
How fucking crazy is that?

3564
02:39:35,100 --> 02:39:37,920
Somebody come up to me on the street and
after a few minutes talking,

3565
02:39:37,930 --> 02:39:41,280
they asked me about my friend in college
email and they knew his name.

3566
02:39:41,281 --> 02:39:42,660
They were like,
how's it going man?

3567
02:39:43,110 --> 02:39:43,560
It's like,
dude,

3568
02:39:43,570 --> 02:39:45,540
I don't.
That's something that someone would find

3569
02:39:45,541 --> 02:39:50,541
out about me months into a friendship at
barely.

3570
02:39:51,511 --> 02:39:56,511
Remember the podcast is a strange thing.
It's the best thing that ever happened 

3571
02:39:57,481 --> 02:39:59,880
for us for standup.
Now people go,

3572
02:39:59,881 --> 02:40:01,650
when you go on stage,
they know what you're going to do.

3573
02:40:01,651 --> 02:40:04,050
They know you're a fucking Weirdo.
It look forward to it.

3574
02:40:04,380 --> 02:40:05,720
They get excited about it.
Thank God.

3575
02:40:05,820 --> 02:40:07,560
You know,
and look,

3576
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:09,060
that's it.
That's all I could say.

3577
02:40:09,090 --> 02:40:10,770
We,
we appreciate that.

3578
02:40:10,771 --> 02:40:14,040
You guys appreciate it.
And by no means we take it for granted,

3579
02:40:14,380 --> 02:40:19,380
it's very,
very important to us and that's exactly 

3580
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:21,750
why the podcast is going to remain free.
It's always going to be free.

3581
02:40:21,751 --> 02:40:23,190
I'm never going to do this thing for 
money.

3582
02:40:23,191 --> 02:40:24,630
I'll figure out a way to make money.
Well,

3583
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:28,950
we'll move it around,
but I love the idea of putting something

3584
02:40:28,951 --> 02:40:32,040
out there that is absolutely 100 percent
free.

3585
02:40:32,430 --> 02:40:33,410
And uh,
you know,

3586
02:40:33,450 --> 02:40:38,450
that's what we've managed to do.
I know a lot of people think that our 

3587
02:40:38,450 --> 02:40:38,450
ads are too long,
but whatever bits off free,

3588
02:40:38,450 --> 02:40:40,800
it's not like fast food.
You can fast forward through it.

3589
02:40:40,801 --> 02:40:41,940
And by the way,
it's like,

3590
02:40:42,450 --> 02:40:43,470
you know,
I mean,

3591
02:40:43,890 --> 02:40:46,350
what does that flashlight.
You're doing something with it.

3592
02:40:47,130 --> 02:40:48,090
Um,
by the way,

3593
02:40:48,091 --> 02:40:49,560
it's not like you have to listen to that
part.

3594
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:51,950
Don't be silly.
So everything else is freaking,

3595
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:55,230
yeah,
don't buy a flashlight if you don't need

3596
02:40:55,231 --> 02:40:56,250
one,
but if you want one,

3597
02:40:56,251 --> 02:40:56,790
they're awesome.

3598
02:40:56,850 --> 02:40:58,920
Go to flashlight.com
and I in the code name Brogan.

3599
02:40:58,950 --> 02:41:03,390
Save yourself 15 percent off the number 
one sex toy for men's number one bitches

3600
02:41:03,630 --> 02:41:05,310
is a bunch of different textures and 
shit.

3601
02:41:05,311 --> 02:41:08,380
If you want to get crazy,
if you're a con of sewer fee,

3602
02:41:08,490 --> 02:41:10,640
what is it they call you a foodie.
If you're a food connoisseur,

3603
02:41:10,660 --> 02:41:12,360
what do they call you?
If you're a sex toy person,

3604
02:41:13,110 --> 02:41:15,950
are you a sexy?
Do would you call it sexy?

3605
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:16,740
Well,
I'm a sexy.

3606
02:41:16,741 --> 02:41:17,230
You know,
I,

3607
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:20,330
I tried toys.
I think two things in my ass.

3608
02:41:21,140 --> 02:41:26,140
I'm a big on dildos libraries.
Once I got past that feeling of 

3609
02:41:26,140 --> 02:41:26,220
something in my ass,
they need that show.

3610
02:41:26,221 --> 02:41:27,870
Like the guy who goes around and eat 
food,

3611
02:41:27,871 --> 02:41:30,730
there's a big guy goes around and talks 
everything fucking sexy.

3612
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:36,200
It's totally possible.
You could do a series of that on for 

3613
02:41:36,200 --> 02:41:36,200
like an Internet porn site.

3614
02:41:36,330 --> 02:41:37,980
Brian talked to one of your people in 
the industry.

3615
02:41:38,010 --> 02:41:40,050
You know,
people that shit would work.

3616
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:41,190
There'll be a good,
uh,

3617
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:42,420
you could have a comic.
Do it,

3618
02:41:43,070 --> 02:41:44,720
have a comic.
You know what?

3619
02:41:44,730 --> 02:41:46,260
Triple e type character.
AAA,

3620
02:41:46,350 --> 02:41:49,050
AAA.
AAA would be perfect.

3621
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:51,780
We should do.
We should start producing our own shows.

3622
02:41:52,050 --> 02:41:54,450
We start producing our own shows.
That's what the next move is.

3623
02:41:54,620 --> 02:41:59,620
We're going to hire a goddamn camera guy
and start doing anytime we have an idea 

3624
02:41:59,620 --> 02:42:03,210
for a sketch would just do it that,
that needs to be done.

3625
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:06,900
A guy who just travels around the 
country and fucks everything goes in our

3626
02:42:06,901 --> 02:42:10,500
outside one of these sticks things in 
his ass and tells you what it felt like.

3627
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:11,550
Well,
you know,

3628
02:42:11,551 --> 02:42:14,220
I don't like something in my ass,
but it makes you come way harder.

3629
02:42:14,550 --> 02:42:16,680
So he's got a fucking vibrator in there.

3630
02:42:17,050 --> 02:42:18,420
Will be a great show.
Yeah.

3631
02:42:18,421 --> 02:42:20,820
We just wouldn't be able to show it all.
You have to hide.

3632
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:24,000
Hide Shit from people.
Go to a fleshlight,

3633
02:42:24,001 --> 02:42:25,860
go buy yourself some,
some goodies.

3634
02:42:26,010 --> 02:42:27,750
Okay.
That's the end of that commercial.

3635
02:42:27,960 --> 02:42:29,850
Go to [inaudible] dot com.
If you want to.

3636
02:42:29,910 --> 02:42:32,330
You don't have to.
O n n I t.

3637
02:42:32,340 --> 02:42:37,340
That is where you can buy all the crazy 
new tropics and supplements that we 

3638
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:41,331
talked about and coming soon,
we're going to have some ridiculous 

3639
02:42:41,331 --> 02:42:41,490
exercise equipment that'll show you 
guys.

3640
02:42:41,491 --> 02:42:43,200
It's going to blow your mind.
It's going to freak you out.

3641
02:42:43,540 --> 02:42:45,090
Um,
that's it.

3642
02:42:45,270 --> 02:42:48,060
That's the end of our 200 podcasts.
We thank you very much.

3643
02:42:48,061 --> 02:42:51,120
We appreciate you very much and we'll be
back next week.

3644
02:42:51,210 --> 02:42:53,790
You dirty bitches.
God is love

3645
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:55,290
one for all and all for one.
