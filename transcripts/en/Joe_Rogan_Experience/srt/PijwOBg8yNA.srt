1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,070
What's up freaks?
Welcome.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,480
Thanks.
Thanks everybody.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,680
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,300
Yeah,
that's my laptop.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,730
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast,

6
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:21,600
brought to you by audible.com.
If you go to audible.com

7

forward slash Joe,
he can get a free audio book and a month

8
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:30,090
of free audible service.
Audible is a really awesome resource for

9
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:35,091
audible audio books for podcasts and 
standup comedy.

10
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:38,580
All kinds of great shit.
It's,

11
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:43,581
um,
one of my favorite things to do in the 

12
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:43,581
car.
I,

13
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,911
I hardly ever listen to music anymore.
I'm always listening to a podcast or 

14
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:46,470
audio books.
It's,

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,270
it's,
it's an amazing resource to.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,310
And it's also amazing for taking time.
That usually is wasted time on an 

17
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:56,340
airplane seat and it actually can be 
enjoyable,

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,800
you know,
he can actually really get into a book.

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,380
It's fun,
especially if they're good.

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,320
The actors are good.

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,280
It's,
uh,

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,980
it makes it really interesting.
It's a,

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,560
it's like reading,
but someone else does all the work.

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,470
Anyway.
Go to audible.com

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,110

You can get a one free audio book and 33

27
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:23,331
days of audible service.
It's a very cool company and they've 

28
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:26,600
supported standup comedy for a long time
and we're also brought to you by Goto 

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,050
meeting and then what the fuck is that 
Joe Rogan?

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,900
Exactly.
Goto meeting by Citrix is a,

31
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:38,910
an easy way to stay connected from 
wherever you want from wherever you are,

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,390
whenever you need to.
All you have to do is just click on a 

33
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,390
link,
turn on a Webcam,

34
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,650
and you're instantly connected to 
whoever you're trying to get connected 

35
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,060
to your team.
And if you're one of them business cats,

36
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:51,060
it likes to have meetings.
Business.

37
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:56,061
Motherfuckers loved to have meetings 
because at least it gets them out of 

38
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:56,061
their offices.

39
00:01:56,061 --> 00:02:00,200
It gives them like social time,
like the regular just sit in your 

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,891
office,
going over numbers and all that 

41
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:03,891
bullshit.
We got to get some meetings going on.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,020
So,
uh,

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,040
this is a nice way of having these 
inevitable meetings and not having to 

44
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,931
actually physically go somewhere that's 
going to happen some day where there's 

45
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,320
going to be no more traveling.
He just going to interface with people,

46
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,900
just going to step up some big gigantic 
screen,

47
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,840
slap some shit into your head screws,
matrix style,

48
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,430
and just going to interface with each 
other.

49
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,670
But until then there's Goto meeting by 
citrix brought to you by centering.

50
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,700
It's um,
a really a interesting way to,

51
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,510
uh,
have,

52
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,670
uh,
meetings online and um,

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,180
the way they have it set up,
they'll let you try goto meeting free 

54
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,970
for 30 days.
So for this special offer,

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
go to gotomeeting.com.
Click the try it free button and use the

56
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,910
Promo Code j r e,
so remember User Promo Code j r a and 

57
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,280
you can try it free for 30 days.

58
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,650
And tell me how you like it.
Uh,

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,480
I want to try to.
Maybe I'll have a goto meeting chats.

60
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,050
I think that'd be fun to get 30 freaks.
We'll meet somewhere and uh,

61
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,820
someone will say something stupid and 
someone will pull their dick out.

62
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,400
What happens if you plead out?
Can you,

63
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,860
what if a kid's porn girls will 
eventually start using this?

64
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,200
That's the problem.
If you have anything like this,

65
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,060
you have any,
any kind of way,

66
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,590
those porn gals are very clever at 
figuring out a way to,

67
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,710
uh,
get through the system to have their own

68
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,030
little,
a Webcam show.

69
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,960
I would think it would benefit them 
greatly.

70
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,990
I wonder if it can't do that.
I don't know you.

71
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,080
This is,
these are some things that you are going

72
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,880
to have to find out for yourself.
All right?

73
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,940
Um,
this is weird.

74
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,180
Okay.
But unless he used Goto meeting with hd 

75
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,180
faces.
Oh,

76
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,180
again,
so the,

77
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,960
this,
this is saying that the,

78
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,340
the,
the,

79
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,700
the images are actually hd.
That's incredible.

80
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,270
So it's an opportunity.
What they're saying is as it's an 

81
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,970
opportunity to look at each other on a 
Webcam,

82
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,940
like really high resolution imagery.
It's not like just,

83
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,680
uh,
the,

84
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,520
the,
the shittiness of the past.

85
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:08,930
When,
when I think about Webcam,

86
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,470
like any kind of conference,
I think it's like a horror movie or 

87
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,500
talking to some duties in Antarctica and
he's like,

88
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:17,810
we've found the samples,
but there's an issue.

89
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,300
And those.
Yeah,

90
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,730
this is hd.
That's incredible.

91
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,800
All right.
We need to figure out a way.

92
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:27,110
We're going to get in touch with Goto 
meeting and figure out a way to,

93
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:31,130
um,
just have one freak party session a week

94
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,580
with 30 people in it and just,
uh,

95
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,060
let people were anonymous masks and 
yell.

96
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,970
Horrible words.

97
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,020
Anyway,
go to meeting,

98
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,270
use a code word Jr.
He also brought to you by [inaudible] 

99
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,270
dot com.
Go to o,

100
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:52,060
n n I t a on it is a Human optimization 
website.

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,340
We basically sell shit to make your body
work better,

102
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,470
whether it's vitamins,
nutrients,

103
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,610
strength and conditioning equipment.
It's all shit that we think is really 

104
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,571
good.
It's all shit that has been proven to 

105
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,941
have some sort of effect either on your 
body's ability to produce testosterone 

106
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:14,090
or your body's ability to process oxygen
more efficiently.

107
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:17,810
Like shroom tech sport.
All of it is science backed.

108
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,840
All of that is explained on the podcast,
but always explained on the website and 

109
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,430
we're running studies on every single 
thing that we have,

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,280
so it takes a long time to do these 
studies.

111
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,740
It takes a long time to get them 
published,

112
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,890
but we've been working on it for awhile 
and we're trying to have this as legit 

113
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:42,260
and above board as is humanly possible.

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,050
One of the ways we do that is there is a
30 pill,

115
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:50,051
90 day money back guarantee.
You don't even have to return the 

116
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,021
product,
so if you try out any of the nutrients 

117
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:53,280
like alpha brain or shroom tack and 
you're like,

118
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,000
this is really wasn't for me.
Get your money back.

119
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,210
That's where we're trying to sell you 
shit that you're gonna want to buy over 

120
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,481
and over again.
We're trying to sell you the best shit 

121
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:05,570
that is currently available and we're 
trying to explain why it's the best shit

122
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:10,571
and then we're trying to get it 
published and we're trying to get it 

123
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:14,170
processed out there so the people kind 
of understand like there's a lot of 

124
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,771
different nutrients that have beneficial
effects on your body and if you combine 

125
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:23,081
them correctly,
you can have a positive impact on your 

126
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:24,740
cognitive function.
Meaning the way your brain works,

127
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,530
it allows your brain to fire better.

128
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,590
Sounds crazy.
It's also been praised recently.

129
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:34,100
Alpha brain has been for a.
It's eight and lucid dreaming.

130
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,980
Apparently these cats I've never 
experienced.

131
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,420
Justin,
you have lucid dreams.

132
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,250
Depends on what your definition of lucid
dreaming is.

133
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,500
Legit wet dream.
Then it's probably lucid dreaming,

134
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,170
right?
I mean I've had dreams.

135
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:53,171
Where.
Have you ever had a dream when you wake 

136
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:53,171
up in the dream?
Think you're awake?

137
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:54,170
Yes.
And then realize you're still.

138
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,560
Yeah.
That's a trip that's kind of lucid.

139
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,950
I think there's people though they can 
get it down to the point where they can 

140
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,071
travel like in.
They can actually like getting that 

141
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:06,071
dream,
northern that dream.

142
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:10,861
No.
There in the world of imagination and 

143
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:12,581
just travel.
They can do things like some like they 

144
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:13,100
get really good at it.
Like it sounds crazy.

145
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:18,101
I and I'm talking,
I'm talking completely from ignorance 

146
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,000
because I've never experienced it.

147
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,110
I've experienced states have it,
but I've never been able to like say I 

148
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,990
am going to go fight a dragon if you 
ever have a recurring dream.

149
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,010
Yes.
Yes.

150
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:31,190
I've had a couple of recurrent james had
won this recurring dream.

151
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:33,520
That's really strange because it's,
uh,

152
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,020
it's about,
um,

153
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,900
it's,
it's,

154
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,960
I've wrote it down,
I called it a thousand teslas and the 

155
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,311
idea was that instead of one nikola 
tesla at the beginning of the 20th 

156
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:49,451
century,
there was a thousand of them and these 

157
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:51,551
motherfuckers are just cranking it out 
together and there was these floating 

158
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,910
machines that were flying around the 
sky,

159
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,040
but everybody was still in the 19 
fifties and 19 sixties fashion garb.

160
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,520
But the world was radically more 
advanced and it was this basically you 

161
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,710
dreamed about the jetsons was,
it was sort of like the jetsons.

162
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,830
It was more english for some reason.

163
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,960
Everybody had an english accent.
It was very,

164
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,520
it's a very strange,
every,

165
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:16,160
there's a lot of like proper,
like 19,

166
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,390
early 19 hundreds.
Behavior and dress cm punk shit.

167
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,070
Yeah.
It was really weird.

168
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:27,071
It's a really weird dream because it's 
happened more than once and it's almost 

169
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,740
like my brain is trying to process that,
you know,

170
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,190
me being a stupid dude,
you know,

171
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:34,580
and I see shit like I see people,
uh,

172
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,360
figuring out the large hadron collider 
and figuring out some new bacteria that 

173
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:45,440
they've developed that eats plastic and,
and I just think if it was me,

174
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,530
if it was up to me to run this fucking 
crazy planet,

175
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,480
much of this work would get done.
Like how much of that absolutely none.

176
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,040
I would have never invented any of this.
And so I realized

177
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,070
a guy like nikola tesla comes along,
just one super genius out of this world 

178
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,190
motherfucker who creates 100 different 
things that change the world.

179
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,820
If that guy had a thousand other ones 
like him,

180
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,780
it would have been an amazing 
transformation of humanity.

181
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,120
It's just that he was so incredibly 
unique.

182
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,300
This one guy,
and of course there was other inventors 

183
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,120
and edison and hundreds of other 
inventors,

184
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:26,121
in fact,
that we're responsible for a lot of the 

185
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:26,190
other things that he actually used to 
make his things.

186
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,100
I mean there's a clear chain of 
intelligence,

187
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,760
but if there was a thousand of those 
super genius motherfuckers that can just

188
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,590
pull these nutty ideas out of thin air,

189
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,910
I gotta tell you man,
I mean if you look,

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,380
if I would have told you and on a.com,
codename,

191
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,330
rogan,
whatever,

192
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,810
that's a car show.
I was having this conversation with 

193
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,511
somebody the other day.
If I told you in 1987 that you would 

194
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:52,861
have a little thing about the size of a 
deck of cards that you carry around in 

195
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:55,030
your hand and you,
the touch of a button can talk to anyone

196
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:57,160
on earth with it.
Video,

197
00:09:57,161 --> 00:10:01,330
chat with people and access all the 
known information in the universe.

198
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,110
Yeah,
no one would fucking believe you for 60 

199
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,480
bucks a month.
It's ridiculous.

200
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,510
And not only that,
but it would also allow your government 

201
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:12,510
to track every move you make.
Yeah.

202
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:12,650
Everybody can track it.

203
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,540
Remove your mic.
We will just see that there was a,

204
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,130
um,
an app that was,

205
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I think it was in Brazil.
They had this app and they took it down 

206
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,980
eventually.
It was an android app that allows people

207
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:25,740
to turn your phone on a listen

208
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,540
you and record you.
It allows,

209
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,100
allows him to hear everything that's 
going on in the room and track you 

210
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,780
through gps that they were using that 
that's some of the shit that we're using

211
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:40,440
in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
That is some crazy shit.

212
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,140
I mean weird if you think about it.
I mean the phone's got it all.

213
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,040
Yeah.
Bluetooth do.

214
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,060
Did you,
have you ever followed any of the 

215
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,330
stuxnet shit and the viruses that came 
out around that time?

216
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,640
I can't think of the name of the other 
virus,

217
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,560
but uh,
it was,

218
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,260
had to be designed.
They were saying the cia or is real,

219
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:06,261
one of the other.
But one of the things that the virus 

220
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:06,720
would do is on a computer that was 
infected with it,

221
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,440
it would search for any bluetooth 
connections in the area.

222
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,040
So if your phone had the bluetooth on,
it wasn't protected,

223
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,040
figure connected that bluetooth,
it will connect to that phone.

224
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,220
This is a computer with a virus on it 
will connect to a phone,

225
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,190
download the address book,
all the contacts.

226
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,250
All that shit and then upload it to a,
a cash site basically,

227
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,880
where then they could come and get it 
and then it would also wait for 

228
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,160
instructions.
Yeah.

229
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,860
Sick.
It's not science fiction,

230
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,300
bro.
I mean this shit's incredible.

231
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,430
Shit happens.
It's,

232
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,480
it's real.
When you saw that michael hastings 

233
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,251
junior,
the reporter that drove 100 miles an 

234
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:49,590
hour,
did you,

235
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,250
did you freak out?
I,

236
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,410
you know,
I mean,

237
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,830
yeah,
it's,

238
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,400
is it,
I think there's some people in this 

239
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,400
world,
you're probably better off.

240
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,880
Not fucking with.
I mean,

241
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,190
even if it's an accident,
you know,

242
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,250
I mean,
when you have people that kill your 

243
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,390
nation's enemy for a living,
you really want to cross that.

244
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,480
You really want to fuck with them.
I mean,

245
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,090
who knows what kind of technology they 
have.

246
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,800
If they can do that with a phone with a 
virus that was engineered either by,

247
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,890
you know,
some superintelligent dudes from 

248
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,640
whatever country and they can do that.
What else can they do that we can't do?

249
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,860
But that's.
I think that's where this recurrent 

250
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:32,860
dream just kept coming from that.
I'm so fucking stupid.

251
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,820
I know.
I'm so fucking stupid,

252
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,330
like in comparison to all these people 
that can make these laptops and make 

253
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,300
these phones and figured out these 
viruses.

254
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,590
I am so removed from the ability to do 
that.

255
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,420
But you know what the to me the thing 
is,

256
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:47,870
yeah,
you're okay,

257
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,490
but a lot of race car drivers don't know
how to build a car either.

258
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,390
It's true.
Yeah.

259
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,140
And to me that's one of the things.
The biggest thing would like what I do.

260
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,570
I mean,
the way I make my living now,

261
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,480
and I started with photography before 
digital camera.

262
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,520
It wasn't for digital cameras.
I would've never picked up a camera if I

263
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:11,521
would've had to pick up a camera and 
then go take some goddamn film and have 

264
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:13,460
it developed and do all this bullshit.
And you know,

265
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,090
every time you made a bad shot it costs 
you a quarter.

266
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,910
I mean there's no fucking way I would 
have stuck with it,

267
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,530
but because of the tools,
this is a perfect example of it.

268
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,040
You know what I mean?
Look at what you've created out of shit.

269
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,390
You buy off the shelf.
You know,

270
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,570
it's a toolkit that allows people out 
there to create things and we've seen 

271
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,620
that now with,
you know,

272
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,600
film,
anything,

273
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,000
you name it,
the bar to entry is no longer technical.

274
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,640
You know,
40 years ago if you wanted to make a 

275
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,821
film,
you were fucked if you didn't have a 

276
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:49,870
bunch of money because it costs that 
much money to do anything now,

277
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,470
you know.

278
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,930
So to me,
the guy who makes it,

279
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,910
yeah,
he's a fucking genius,

280
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,570
but the guy who takes that tool and then
expands on it and creates new things 

281
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:02,680
with it,
there's just a smart,

282
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,930
well it's good.
It's just what they,

283
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,070
you know,
those people do though.

284
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:10,080
I mean they build off of each other and 
that's where the,

285
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,100
the thousand tesla idea came from is 
like if you had a thousand of those 

286
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,760
motherfuckers communicating with each 
other,

287
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,380
but if you had a thousand means nothing 
to figure out with the rock,

288
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,530
maybe I'll figure that out.
Eventually find a sharp rock and I'd be 

289
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,821
like,
I need to figure out how to make these 

290
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:32,821
on my own.
Yeah.

291
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:33,640
I was driving out here from vegas and I 
had never seen this.

292
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:38,641
It's been a while since I made the drive
and I don't know if this fucking 

293
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:41,401
facilities new or what,
but coming out on 15 on the right hand 

294
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:44,200
side of the road,
I saw this.

295
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,520
It looked like a giant fucking pond or a
lake or something like that.

296
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,950
And then there was a big ass tower 
sticking up in the middle of it.

297
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,070
And this is in the middle of the desert.
Like,

298
00:14:55,071 --> 00:15:00,071
what in the fuck is that?
Finally I figured out it's one of those 

299
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:01,550
solar farms.
Have you ever seen one of those?

300
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,580
And I think this is how it works.
I need to google this shit and find out 

301
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:06,850
exactly what it is.
But um,

302
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,310
it looked to me like in the big ass 
tower because I've seen some things 

303
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,910
where these solar farms,
they have all these mirrors and they all

304
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:18,760
focus on this center tower and then they
turn that energy into a,

305
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,840
I guess heat or however the fuck they do
it.

306
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,370
Oh,
I'm looking at these images.

307
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:26,980
Google images or solar farms.
I didn't even know this existed and uh,

308
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,970
for California it's a fucking crime.

309
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,840
They don't use it.
And I'm sitting here and I'm thinking,

310
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:33,900
I'm like,
why isn't this fucking desert covered in

311
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,600
solar panels?
Yeah.

312
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,680
You know,
I mean,

313
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,180
but then again,
I guess if you look at how much,

314
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,000
how much fossil fuels does it take to 
create something like that and then,

315
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:51,001
well,
how long is the break even point to 

316
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,170
where it actually is making sense.
That's a good point that people don't 

317
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,220
recognize that it takes a lot of fossil 
fuels to make things,

318
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,960
make plastics to make everything,
you know?

319
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:00,740
I mean just drive the trucks to get the 
shit out there.

320
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,940
Yeah,
that's true.

321
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,140
That's a really,
really,

322
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:07,280
really important point.
But I guess even with,

323
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:08,270
um,
I mean,

324
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,200
isn't it possible to make a lot of 
things without it though?

325
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,630
I mean if you used electricity only from
solar power to make machines that ran on

326
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:19,660
solar power,
you know,

327
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,300
I don't know man.

328
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,300
I was,
I think I was thinking when I saw that 

329
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,971
solar shit,
it got me thinking about oil and one 

330
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:29,570
thing I've always had a thought about it
was after nine slash 11,

331
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:34,571
I think the one of the biggest fuck ups 
bush had was he had the opportunity for 

332
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,630
kind of a manhattan project moment.
I think if he would've came out and 

333
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,030
said,
look,

334
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,200
we're getting off oil as much as 
possible because it's not a green planet

335
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:49,940
issue.
It's not a tree hugger issue.

336
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,420
None of that to national security issue.
Because if you look at most of the 

337
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,560
bullshit our country's gotten involved 
in the last 40 years,

338
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,650
it's for oil,
which I'm not against.

339
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:04,010
I mean oil.
I mean it is a national security thing.

340
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,840
People who say,
well no,

341
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:06,980
blood for oil,
okay,

342
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:10,700
pay $10 a gallon for gas and watch your 
fucking economy crash,

343
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,440
you know,
so.

344
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,640
But to me that was,
that could have been a manhattan project

345
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:21,641
moment or something similar to where you
make a giant breakthrough and because 

346
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,780
this country has always proven that if 
you,

347
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,840
if you pointed in the right direction 
and give it a mandate and then back it 

348
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,050
up,
perfect example,

349
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,830
moon landing,
the apollo program,

350
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,490
they started with nothing.
I mean literally nothing and 10 years,

351
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,440
not even 10 years later in that decade,
you know,

352
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:40,880
there was a man on the moon.
Well,

353
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:42,230
depending if you believe on that or not.

354
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,480
But uh,
yeah,

355
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,600
my point is humans can get,
we can,

356
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,980
if backed against the wall,
we can get some incredible

357
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,050
things.
She would have used that as a mandate to

358
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:52,590
say,
look,

359
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,770
this is a national security issue.
You know,

360
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,800
we're gonna.
But it would be your sounding like he's 

361
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:00,800
like a real president.
Well that's true.

362
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,200
Well,
I'm just saying the opportunity.

363
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,760
Well,
the opportunity was there,

364
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,190
so the opportunity was there.
But unfortunately that opportunity,

365
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:10,191
it could have been capitalized on people
other than the people that were 

366
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:11,340
monopolizing the natural resources.
And that wasn't going to happen.

367
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,400
The real issue is always money because 
the money's being monopolized right now.

368
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,680
The money's being such a mass mass 
amount of wealth that's connected to oil

369
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,470
that it's almost if you let people 
control that,

370
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:30,471
the amount of money they have,
they could have a giant crazy army and 

371
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:32,720
the year like you have to be really 
careful of that and it's,

372
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,560
it's,
it's a shame that you know,

373
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,640
when you drive from vegas to California 
and you see those gigantic fucking open 

374
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,280
desert fields where there's just 
nothing.

375
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,910
Those could all be just filled up with 
solar panels.

376
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,210
They could just be plugging cars in.
The cars they have now are getting 

377
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,560
close,
like they have that tesla model s yeah.

378
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,350
That's getting really close.
I mean,

379
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:03,351
it's crazy.
What other technology do you use this 

380
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,470
100 years old?
Yeah,

381
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,790
in your life.
Think about it.

382
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,970
Can you name one fucking thing you use 
day to day?

383
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,600
That's 100 years old air conditioning.
Not 100 fucking years old situations on 

384
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,531
other users,
100 years old and the internal 

385
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:19,050
combustion engine,
but do you think that it's the most fun?

386
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,520
The problem with those electric engines,
I've never driven an electric car.

387
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,950
They're missing something.
They're golf carts,

388
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,900
they're missing soul.
I did watch god.

389
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,960
What the fuck was that car that guy 
made?

390
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,600
I forget where I saw it,
but a dude.

391
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,230
I'm high performance electric cars.
It's kind of a hate.

392
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,260
Does a handle thing.
Cars like a 100 grand or some bullshit 

393
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,950
like that.
But the numbers on it are sick.

394
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,700
Is that the tesla roadster?
No,

395
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,580
this is a hand built thing this guy 
makes.

396
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,390
Oh really?
Where the fuck did I see that?

397
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,800
I can't remember.
I'm terrible with that.

398
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,060
But anyway.
Um,

399
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,290
the numbers on it are crazy and it's 
just like the torque.

400
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,550
There's no lag.
There's no nothing.

401
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:00,690
It's instant.
You know,

402
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,000
everything's electric better.
Yeah.

403
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,940
So it's just sad.
It can be better,

404
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,300
but he was actually running eighth mile 
drags with it.

405
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,950
Wow.
And uh,

406
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,290
it was pretty slick,
but very fast.

407
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,710
Yeah.
I mean there's,

408
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,390
I don't know,
you wonder.

409
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,910
I mean,
it's got to go there.

410
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,810
I mean,
right.

411
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,770
What seems like it's going there,
but it tried to go there before.

412
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:27,720
Do you ever see that documentary who 
killed the electric car?

413
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,530
Yeah,
I think there's gotta be something 

414
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,790
better than what we're doing this 
burning ship and you know,

415
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,210
that's how you get things done.
It seems like really stupid at this 

416
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:41,210
point.
But.

417
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,020
So does this nuclear thing.
That seems like a really stupid idea to,

418
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,450
you know,
I'm not educated enough on the nuclear 

419
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:48,450
thing.
I hear both,

420
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,190
but if you look at it takes.
It's kinda like the old joke that you 

421
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,541
know,
you can build a thousand bridges but 

422
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:57,541
suck one dick.
Remember he was a bridge builder.

423
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,710
You can build a thousand nuclear plants 
would have one fukushima.

424
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,360
But the problem is this,

425
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,310
it's been a few.
There's three mile island.

426
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,490
There's the fukushima and is it four 
mile,

427
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,760
three mile island for 3:43
mile island?

428
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,590
Yeah,
I,

429
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,480
as I said before on the podcast for 
apologies,

430
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:21,070
ladies and gentleman,
I'm fukushima and those are two a.

431
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,710
And I'm a turnover.
That's three.

432
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,770
So there's three spots.

433
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:30,310
Did you can't really,
you russian nuclear plants are just bad 

434
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,210
fucking ideal.
Everybody's nuclear pants a bad idea.

435
00:21:32,211 --> 00:21:36,080
But my russians come on man.
But my point was that you,

436
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,380
you're dealing with less than 100 years 
of use.

437
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Sure.
You already have three spots that are 

438
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:44,560
completely ruined forever.
Forever.

439
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,150
Like longer than people have ever been 
alive.

440
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,250
Right.
You know what,

441
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:50,720
you go back 100,000
years ago.

442
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:52,910
What did that dude look like 200,000
years ago?

443
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,560
Was that even a person?
You know,

444
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,610
if you ran into that thing running 
around naked eating fucking squirrels 

445
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,220
with his face,
that's barely a person.

446
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,930
And that's how long from there to now 
where it's like,

447
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:08,720
that's like anybody can go back and have
a picnic and you'll still get sick.

448
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,680
Sure.
You know,

449
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:14,681
it's still not healthy.
It's not like living near a fucking 

450
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:14,681
fresh spring.
It's creepy,

451
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:18,701
man.
I haven't kept up with the fukushima 

452
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:18,701
shit.
I heard it's bad.

453
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:22,610
There was now I don't know about the 
radiation and all that shit,

454
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,940
but they were saying that um,
there's actually debris now washing up 

455
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,300
in Canada on the west coast and shit 
like that.

456
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,510
It's made its way all the way over here.

457
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,030
Yeah,
it's really weird.

458
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,210
It's um,
it's not just that they,

459
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,260
they,
there's an inevitable loss of this water

460
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,770
that they use in the cool down the 
reactor,

461
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,060
keeps getting into the ocean that's 
getting into the ocean,

462
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,600
the tune of millions of gallons.
So they send the water in the cooler and

463
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,880
then pump it back in.
It's not even that they pump it,

464
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:56,881
it leaks out.
There's a lot of leakage to trying to 

465
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:58,951
develop a system of holding it in place.
Now involves drilling these giant holes 

466
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,590
deep,
deep,

467
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:04,591
deep into the ground and then inserting 
this machine that essentially permafrost

468
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:09,631
the ground.
And so there's like tubes and you would 

469
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:10,000
freeze these tubes.
So there's a,

470
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,900
there's all these holes in the ground 
and then around that you had placed this

471
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:17,230
machine that freezes the shit out of 
everything.

472
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,440
So it's a giant containment wall,
millions of gallons containment wall for

473
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,790
keeping in this insane nuclear water 
waste.

474
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,210
But the issue is of course you have to 
keep the power on this machine on.

475
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,610
And the whole point with you guys fucked
up was your power went off and then he 

476
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,541
couldn't cool the reactor down.
So you're doing another thing based on 

477
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:46,140
power,
right when you've already been sort of 

478
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,510
been shown that we have these ideas of 
what mother nature can or can't throw it

479
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,720
us and it's only based on a limited 
window of time that we've been measuring

480
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,450
it less than a few hundred years and 
even,

481
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:54,370
you know,
200 years ago,

482
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:59,371
who the fuck knows what kind of shit bag
equipment they were figuring out what 

483
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,500
the wind speed the wind was when it was 
coming and they didn't really know.

484
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,960
So that's a blink of a fucking eye in 
terms of the world and how,

485
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,220
how the weather changes,
you know,

486
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,230
the weather can shift radically there.
It can do some really crazy shit.

487
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,680
So for you to count on,
you being able to keep the power on is 

488
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,581
just ridiculous.
You count on being able to turn it back 

489
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:21,581
on.
Yes.

490
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:23,150
I'm sure you'll probably be able to turn
it back on,

491
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,780
but count on keeping it on.
And if you don't keep it on what happens

492
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,210
that thaws out and all the fucking 
nuclear water,

493
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,020
a trillion gallons goes flooding into 
the fucking ocean.

494
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,450
Yeah,
that's a pretty big risk.

495
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,850
That's a big bet.
It's weird.

496
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,820
It's just weird.
It's a weird that we're

497
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,990
boiled down to that.
It's like,

498
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,020
how did this.
This seems like a chess game that 

499
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,020
someone treated like checkers,
right?

500
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,960
It's like they figure you,
can we make it?

501
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,480
Let's fucking do it.
Can we do a nuclear power plant?

502
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,830
Let's do it.
Let's just make it.

503
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,910
Hey,
we can do it.

504
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,080
What happens if power goes out?

505
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,390
That's human nature,
man.

506
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:58,310
We've been doing that shit for,
you know,

507
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,100
since we came out of the cave.
Yeah,

508
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:02,930
but this is one of the most dangerous 
examples of it.

509
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,560
The idea that you could just completely 
poisoned the environment to the point of

510
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:09,710
like if you were an alien dvt,
it would look like venom.

511
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,980
Ddt.
Yeah.

512
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:14,870
I mean fucking cigarettes,
tobacco.

513
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,310
I mean how many millions of people is 
that killed over the years and it's just

514
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:26,170
humans aren't the brightest,
sharpest knife in the drawer when it 

515
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,531
comes to shit like that.
How much better are there certain 

516
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:29,531
cigarettes?
How much better those things?

517
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:30,490
I don't know.
I don't know anything about.

518
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:32,810
I've never smoked and I don't,
uh,

519
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:37,930
I don't know anything about that stuff.
It's one of the more dirty aspects of 

520
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,090
politics is a,
you'll never see a politician talk about

521
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:42,380
cigarettes.
Too much money,

522
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:42,620
man.

523
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,360
Too much gas,
as many taxes.

524
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,520
Isn't that amazing though?
I mean,

525
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:51,521
what a weird commitment to something 
that poisons people think about if 

526
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:54,230
you're a politician or if that's.
If you're in the business of government,

527
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,650
here's an item that no matter whenever 
you get into a tough spot,

528
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,250
you just fucking pass a sin tax.
You know,

529
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,930
cigarettes and booze.
People will bitch,

530
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,650
you know,
they like,

531
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,960
they won't buy it.
Yeah.

532
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,150
You know?
Yeah.

533
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,160
You tax it further,
trying to prevent this terrible plague 

534
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,250
and that's how you spin it in a way 
we're trying to prevent this terrible 

535
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,041
plague is by managing millions and 
millions of dollars from it and then 

536
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:21,660
thus being connected to it.
An extra blade.

537
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,740
Yeah.
They don't ever let go of money.

538
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,630
Once they figured out a way to make 
money from something,

539
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:31,631
they just keep the law the same.
It's very difficult to create laws that 

540
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,010
stop politicians from making as much 
money to cut their money back in certain

541
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:39,011
situations like this.
This idea that that's the will of the 

542
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:40,760
people,
so fucking stupid.

543
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,070
It's creepy fucking organization we 
have.

544
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,890
It's a.
I don't know man.

545
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:51,891
It's.
I liked the idea that our country 

546
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:52,540
started out with that.
You know,

547
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,230
when you went to government,
it was service.

548
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,860
It wasn't a full time.
It wasn't meant to be a full time 

549
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,291
position.
We weren't meant to have senators with 

550
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:03,291
40 fucking years.
Seniority in the senate.

551
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,720
It was meant that you went,
you did your service,

552
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:11,340
you represented your district or your 
local area and you know.

553
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,240
Then you went home

554
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,890
and the next guy went.
Yeah,

555
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,490
and we've turned into like basically any
other longstanding country with a ruling

556
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:25,891
class and they put rs and ds in front of
their names to give somebody something 

557
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:29,020
to hang onto the vote for.
It's all the same shit.

558
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Not only that,
they absolutely provably force out the 

559
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,561
other parties.
Absolutely provably make it much more 

560
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:39,680
difficult for them to be involved in 
debates.

561
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,600
If you look at the coverage of anybody 
that's outside of the standard,

562
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:47,360
two choices,
the coverage from they learned from ross

563
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:52,361
perot tell you what ross perot and 
billion dollar monkey wrench in there 

564
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:55,850
fucking plans and folks who were young 
and full of life.

565
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,590
He don't remember.
Ross perot,

566
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,720
ross perot costumers.
Bush's second term.

567
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,150
Yeah.
Ross perot was a bad motherfucker.

568
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:04,340
That's why clinton won.
He came around.

569
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Ross perot came around and all the 
sudden there was this billionaire dude 

570
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,760
explaining how the government works,
explaining the federal debt,

571
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,180
explaining the,
the,

572
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,500
the federal bank explaining taxes,
and you're like,

573
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:20,210
wait,
what the fuck is going on?

574
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:25,211
He took out time on network television.
That's what so gangster brought him 

575
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:25,970
because he was before the internet.

576
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,370
This was not going on when everybody was
online.

577
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:30,020
This is like early nineties.
Yeah.

578
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,330
You know what was I remember year?
Was it the clinton?

579
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,910
The election was 92,
right?

580
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:34,400
Yeah,
yeah.

581
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,570
Ninety two.
Yeah,

582
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,600
man.
I remember my friend john was helping 

583
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:40,600
with his campaign and it helps with 
anybody's campaign.

584
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,131
It's like,
this motherfucker's going to get rid of 

585
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:46,811
all the crooks.
He was so excited about them and people 

586
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:46,940
are excited about ross perot was like 
the original ron paul,

587
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:52,060
right?
But ross perot was way more gangster 

588
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,230
because he had all that cash and the 
money and how do I talk and saying,

589
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:58,510
here's the problem.
The crazy old fuck from down in Texas 

590
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:58,510
can tell you.
That was.

591
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,610
Yeah,
that was a real interesting thing.

592
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:06,611
So from there they changed the 
commission for presidential debates or 

593
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,790
whatever they call it,
which is a privately funded institution,

594
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,090
you know,
corporations back it.

595
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,140
It's not.
It's not like it's a government program 

596
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,140
so they can decide who gets the debate,
who doesn't.

597
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,030
There's a ross.

598
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,630
What's crazy?

599
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,740
I process in Washington where after have
started for a while,

600
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:25,570
you can't.
She hadn't become a foreign lobbyist.

601
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:27,110
Make $30,000
a month,

602
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,930
then take leave,
work on presidential campaigns,

603
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,070
make sure you've got good contacts and 
then go back out and if you just want to

604
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:36,860
get down to brass tacks,
first thing y'all to do is get all these

605
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:41,861
folks.
They've got these one way trade 

606
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:41,861
agreements that we've negotiated with 
the ehrs.

607
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:44,070
Say us.
We'll take the same deal we gave you and

608
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,260
mail gridlocked right at that point 
because for example,

609
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:52,350
we've got international competitors who 
simply could not unload their cars off 

610
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,161
the ships if they had to comply.
You're saying if it was a two way 

611
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:56,710
street,
just couldn't do it.

612
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,370
We have got to stop sending jobs 
overseas.

613
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,410
Probably a good thing.
He didn't win no business paper.

614
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,610
Otherwise we'd be occupying China right 
now.

615
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,150
$14 an hour for a factory worker and you
can move your factor south.

616
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,260
The border,
high dollar an hour for labor.

617
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:18,290
Hire young 25.
That's assuming you've been in business 

618
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:18,290
for a long time.
You've got a mature work for you.

619
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,390
Pay a dollar an hour for your labor.
Have no health care.

620
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,980
That's the most expensive single 
element.

621
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,730
Making a car,
have no environmental controls,

622
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,740
no pollution controls and no retirement 
and you don't care about anything but 

623
00:30:31,591 --> 00:30:36,591
making money.
There will be a sucking sound going 

624
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:39,150
south so we.
If if the people send me to Washington,

625
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:41,940
the first thing I'll do is study that 
2000 page agreement.

626
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,150
Second row.

627
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,250
Alright,
one last point here,

628
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:51,251
I've called out,
I decided I was dumb and didn't 

629
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,171
understand it,
so I called a who's who of the folks 

630
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:53,171
who've been around it and I said,
why won't everybody goes south?

631
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:54,440
They say will be disruptive.
I said,

632
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:56,260
for how long?
I finally got them up for 12,

633
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,570
15 years,
and I said,

634
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,090
well,
how does it stop being disrupted?

635
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,280
And that is when their jobs come up from
a dollar,

636
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:04,250
now they're $6 an hour and hours go down
to $6 an hour.

637
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,460
Then it's leveled again.
But in the meantime you've wrecked the 

638
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:09,460
country where these kinds of deals.

639
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,410
Holy shit,
thank you.

640
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:10,710
Ms dot,
dot,

641
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:10,910
dot,
dot.

642
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:15,880
Holy shit.
Ross perot was calling shit in 1992.

643
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,680
He was a gangster.
I mean he.

644
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,300
How correct was that though?

645
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,800
What's funny is he was just talking 
about the auto industry.

646
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:26,801
I spent 10 years in the auto industry.
I worked for ford motor company for 

647
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,070
almost a decade.
And uh,

648
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,500
I took a buyout and they are,
our plant actually closed a few years 

649
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:37,990
ago that I worked at in indianapolis.
But that industry is not the same and 

650
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,140
it's gone and people in.
Yeah,

651
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,510
there's a lot of shit with the union and
you know,

652
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:47,900
you can argue both sides of that and 
it's like most things,

653
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:50,840
there's no somewhere in the middle is 
the truth.

654
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:56,000
But you know,
that whole way of life for a big part of

655
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:59,960
this country that auto industry was,
you know,

656
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,570
that was,
that is the middle class,

657
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,520
that was the middle class,
you know,

658
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:09,521
you could go to work for one of those 
companies or one of the companies that 

659
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:13,061
supplied that industry and work 30 years
and raise a family and your kids could 

660
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:17,720
have a better life than you.
And that's all gone now.

661
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,900
Yeah.
There was a possibility for a guy to get

662
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:24,140
a really good job without an education.
Just,

663
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:29,141
you know,
you could get a really good job that 

664
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:29,141
paid really well and you could have a 
good living.

665
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:29,930
You know,
you could have a boat,

666
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,810
you could ever,
you know,

667
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:32,480
you know,
you'd have toys you could have,

668
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,640
you could have a whole vacation,
cars

669
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,450
and,
and,

670
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,740
and you could,
you know,

671
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,760
I mean like when I was there,
if you just worked a straight 40 hours,

672
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,750
you'd make about 60,000
a year.

673
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,090
Now,
60,000

674
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,940
a year in Indiana or the midwest is 
decent money.

675
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,230
If you worked overtime you could get up 
80 to 100 grand,

676
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,830
but you could,
if you worked your ass off seven 

677
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,830
twelves,
all the overtime you could get,

678
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,670
you could top out at about 1:20,
but that's literally living your life in

679
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:06,470
the plant seven,
seven days a week,

680
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:09,020
12 hours a day.
But they do that.

681
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,890
Yes.
Yes.

682
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:15,670
And I'll tell you what that was.
I'm glad I did that because I was able 

683
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,190
to see that culture of.
And then there was a long,

684
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:24,210
there's a long history there of,
because at least with ford motor 

685
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,960
company,
nepotism was a well established thing.

686
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:28,280
That's how they did business.

687
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,340
They hired sons,
they hired daughters,

688
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,740
you know that it was,
I was third generation for ford motor 

689
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:36,740
company.
I worked with guys.

690
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,110
I literally worked with three 
generations of the same family,

691
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,330
grandfather,
father and son.

692
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,050
Um,
and it's,

693
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:50,260
what years were this?
This was I hired on in 1997 to December,

694
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,910
2006 is when I left in December,
2000 dollars just from the mustang.

695
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,290
Started getting good again,
right?

696
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,090
Yeah,
exactly.

697
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,660
Figured it out after all those years,
but it,

698
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,800
uh,
it and there was a lot of institutional 

699
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,631
memory and it was the only place I've 
ever worked where people at a factory 

700
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:14,000
environment because I,
I'm from the midwest and I always worked

701
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:15,990
in machine shops,
tools,

702
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,960
tool and dye places,
stuff like that.

703
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,860
And that place you are proud to work 
there.

704
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,050
You are happy to work there at least in 
the beginning.

705
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,060
But I mean a lot of people.

706
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,240
That was the,
that was one of the ways they define 

707
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,671
their lives.
They were a uaw ford motor employee and 

708
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:40,241
it sounds silly to people who have never
don't understand it or anything like 

709
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:46,451
that,
but you have to realize you're talking 

710
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,671
about people that they weren't,
they didn't have to wake up one day and 

711
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:50,520
make a choice between being a doctor and
being an auto worker,

712
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,060
you know,
that wasn't their fucking options on the

713
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:58,061
table there.
Options on the table or be an auto 

714
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:01,181
worker,
be able to send your kids to school and 

715
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:03,281
have a nice life or go out and scramble 
for six and $7 an hour jobs for the rest

716
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:04,420
of your life.
You know.

717
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,640
And that's so guys you bought into that.
They bought into that whole dream,

718
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,010
that thing of,
you know,

719
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,600
and the company pushed that,
you know,

720
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,340
we're in this together company and union
and you know,

721
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,930
quality and all this other shit.

722
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,380
And people bought into it.
And that was why there was such a big 

723
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,240
backlash when people figured out that,
you know,

724
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,280
no matter what the fuck you do on the 
line,

725
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:37,210
it's not going to make a difference.
If the asshole up in detroit decides to 

726
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,231
build a dog shit car or,
or decides to like go buy fucking jaguar

727
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,540
and lose hundreds of millions of dollars
on shit like that.

728
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,860
And so that's how plants get clothes.
And,

729
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,580
and not only that,
it's just a co,

730
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,990
we lost our plant because all this shit 
went to Mexico.

731
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:57,410
Wow.
I mean it got to the point and the 

732
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,231
reason why our plant started,
I wouldn't say in 1958 was when it 

733
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:02,240
opened.
Um,

734
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,330
when you have a plant that fucking old 
eventually,

735
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,510
you know,
it just gets to the point where it costs

736
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:12,570
more to fix shit than it does to move it
somewhere else.

737
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,290
So why would you spend $200,000,000
rehab in a plant that's 50 years old 

738
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,400
when you could go down to Mexico,
get out from under all the fucking 

739
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,400
retirement,
all the,

740
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,111
all the bullshit that you know,
he has accrued here for right or wrong.

741
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,320
And so they just finally were like,
fuck it,

742
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:39,321
we're done.
So what four did was they actually 

743
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:41,511
formed a company.
They kept all their plants that 

744
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:42,510
assembled cars under and they called 
them ford plants,

745
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,280
all their plants that built parts.
If you didn't put a car together,

746
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,620
if you put a car together,
you were afforded employee.

747
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,250
If you didn't,
they spawn all their parts plants off,

748
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:56,190
which didn't generate money.
They were actually.

749
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,180
So they spend all their parts plants off
to a company called visteon.

750
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Gm did the same thing with delphi,
so they spend all these plants off and 

751
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:06,180
they say,
okay,

752
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:06,870
you're on your own.

753
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:11,870
Now we're going to give you your own 
company and you're going to have to go 

754
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,140
out and you have to make your own money.
Pay your own bills,

755
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,420
but here's the fucking trick.
These were four plants on monday.

756
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,640
On tuesday,
they're visteon plants,

757
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,060
so now they're on their own.
They're on the open market.

758
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:26,100
They have to make their own money.
But guess what?

759
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,190
They've only got one customer ford motor
company because that's who they made 

760
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,990
plants that they were for it on monday,
right?

761
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,450
So they were always made parts for them.
So now what happens?

762
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,750
Ford comes to these companies before 
they knew they were losing money when 

763
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,050
they spun them off to make parts of the 
cost that ford was paying,

764
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,640
and four,
it says you're going to have to do 

765
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:48,640
better on the price.
We're going to have to cut you off.

766
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,280
And these were all ford people and so 
what happens is now they start cutting 

767
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,790
and it just,
it was,

768
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,220
you know,
it was a long way for them to close a 

769
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,220
bunch of plants.

770
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,040
Gm went through the same thing and 
that's how they justify the moves to 

771
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:05,100
Mexico.
Yeah,

772
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,180
it,
it's,

773
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,150
it's,
you know,

774
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,650
it was why did the car suck?
You know,

775
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:14,760
the cars.
I think a lot of it had to do when I was

776
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:17,550
there,
the cars were dog shit in the eighties,

777
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,130
you know,
it's cool quality.

778
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:25,131
I mean it was Japan brought in the 
quality aspect of it and you know,

779
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:31,311
the old saying,
don't ever buy a car assembled on a 

780
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:31,311
friday,
you know,

781
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:32,040
you ever hear that?
You know,

782
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,290
that was detroit,
that was America,

783
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:36,940
that was the american auto industry in 
the seventies and eighties.

784
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,610
And then they would just fat living high
on the hog.

785
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:40,940
I mean they were just,
you know,

786
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,650
you'd hear stories about these guys,
they used to have show up,

787
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:49,651
no show jobs to where at one time our 
plant and had like 5,000

788
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:54,931
employees there when I worked there we 
had like 2100 and we were doing more 

789
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:56,770
work than the guys did in the eighties 
with 5,000.

790
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,590
But they would have guys,
they would have,

791
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,150
they call them break off jobs.
So say you're working a 10 hour shift,

792
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:09,870
you would go in,
you would go in and work two hours and 

793
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,781
then you break off and the other guy 
would come in and he worked two hours 

794
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:16,100
and he'd break off and you do that.
So because of what it was,

795
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,060
each job at a set rate.
So.

796
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,150
But the thing is they send on 
understanding you.

797
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:24,610
What do you mean by break off?
Like you say you're line,

798
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,630
okay,
and you've got to take this fucking cup 

799
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,400
and put it here,
pour some shit in it and then put it 

800
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,281
there.
What they would do is they would say 

801
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:37,591
that's a two man job,
so one guy would take this cup and he 

802
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:41,191
would set it here,
the other guy would pour some shit and 

803
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:41,191
then move it here.

804
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:42,550
Now eight hours a day.
Well one guy can do that.

805
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,030
So for eight hours you got two men on 
this job.

806
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,630
I would tell this guy,
go get lost for two hours and then I 

807
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,690
will do both jobs and then he comes 
back,

808
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,850
come back,
and he would do both.

809
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,390
And so that's how you do the eight 
hours.

810
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:57,580
You actually only work for exactly two 
shifts.

811
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,790
Yeah.
And those were called break off jobs and

812
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:03,370
the plant was rife with them.
That's interesting.

813
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,680
And then they went through and they 
killed all that shit,

814
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:08,470
which they're supposed to.
So I can go to the gym,

815
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,930
got so fucking bad guys.
We're only doing a day on a day off.

816
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:19,410
They would come in,
run their car to show they were there 

817
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:19,410
and then jet.
And then you know,

818
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:22,870
one guy worked monday,
tuesday work wednesday.

819
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,280
So you can understand in some ways,
oh,

820
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:25,930
it's brutal.

821
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,690
Need to get rid of american labor.
Right.

822
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,650
So at that point when it gets that bad,
yeah,

823
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:37,651
there has to be a correction.
And I also lived in Kentucky and I saw 

824
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:41,770
when toyota came in,
there was no before I worked before when

825
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:46,771
I was a kid I went to college in 
Kentucky and then the summers I worked 

826
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:50,431
for a toyota parts plant down there.
So I saw that side of the auto industry 

827
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:54,901
before I ever saw the big money union 
side and the way that worked was equally

828
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,050
as fucked up.
But on the other end of the scale,

829
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,660
what they would do is they would hire 
temp workers.

830
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,210
Okay.
And they would go in and you would do,

831
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,360
you know,
assembly work or wherever the fuck it 

832
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,011
was.
And they would dangle this idea of a 

833
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,861
full time job in front of you.
Now this is in southeastern Kentucky 

834
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:15,550
where if you could make $15 an hour in 
1993,

835
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,290
you could live.
You can own a house because the shit,

836
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,030
I mean,
$40,000

837
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:27,031
a year.
There's a great wage because there's 

838
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:29,100
nothing.
It's walmart or nothing or you know,

839
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,820
you sell weed,
that's it.

840
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,040
And but what they would do

841
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,440
is it would hire these temps in say,
look,

842
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,610
you got a 90 day probation period,
you can work if we like you,

843
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:41,930
we'll hire you,
you get benefits,

844
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:46,931
you get all this bullshit problem is.
And they hired you through a temp 

845
00:41:46,931 --> 00:41:50,111
agency.
Problem is they never fucking hired 

846
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:52,751
anybody.
They've worked for 89 days and then say 

847
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:55,730
we don't need you tomorrow,
send you home and bring another guy in.

848
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,760
So they never hired anybody.
Oh wow.

849
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,590
They just kept their employee filled 
with temps and then you know,

850
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,410
they would find there are certain 
positions where they needed,

851
00:42:05,411 --> 00:42:06,410
you know,
supervisors,

852
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:07,850
quality guys,
shit like that.

853
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,880
Skilled positions and they would hire 
those people full time but grounds on 

854
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,970
the line and shit like that.
I mean you were cannon fodder.

855
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,390
It's really interesting because there's 
like a cause and effect.

856
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,490
There's,
you know,

857
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,280
there's things were out of control,
but the,

858
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:25,220
the counter effect of that is to just 
not have it up here at all.

859
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,750
Yeah.
This is really interesting.

860
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,930
It's,
I don't know where,

861
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,540
to me,
what it is is it's,

862
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:34,541
it's basically,
it's just we were losing the middle 

863
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:37,121
class.
We've lost it and I can see both 

864
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:37,121
arguments for that.
You know,

865
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,240
it's,
I'm kind of a guy.

866
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:43,590
Like now what I do,
I go work in casinos and I have to work 

867
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,440
with unions and it makes me want to pull
my fucking hair out.

868
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,030
It's the most brutal shit in the world.
Did you see the culinary unions in front

869
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,330
of the tropicana screaming at people in 
a video?

870
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,010
I put it up on youtube today.
Dana.

871
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,540
Dana white.
Let me know about it.

872
00:42:56,541 --> 00:43:00,500
This culinary union has been trying to 
keep the ufc out of New York,

873
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,720
new york's the last date,
last hold out,

874
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,340
and it's all because of the culinary 
union,

875
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:09,370
culinary and spend a shitload of money 
trying to consider the station casinos 

876
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,911
here because the same company that owns 
the ufc own station casinos and they're 

877
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:17,321
non union and in their employees voted 
for them to be nonunion allegedly.

878
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,760
Right.
According to the information that I've 

879
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,061
read,
I shouldn't say allegedly I should say 

880
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:25,061
to,
to the best of my knowledge,

881
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:25,970
they don't.
They didn't want it to be union.

882
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,760
They would have to pay union dues.
If you get paid well by your company,

883
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:29,990
you don't have to,
you know,

884
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,440
use what they were like yelling at 
people while these people were going 

885
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,980
into this casino.
They're telling people not to go in 

886
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,140
because the casino's not union,
so they're being bullies.

887
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,020
They're,
they're bullying people that are walking

888
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:43,190
into the casino.
That's just so.

889
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,220
It's so unfortunate because it used to 
be the unions were there to make sure 

890
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,601
that people have a good wage and protect
your rights and make sure that you can 

891
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:53,940
know.
You get a fair share of your,

892
00:43:53,941 --> 00:43:55,130
you know,
your effort.

893
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,860
That helps build that business.
It's a great idea,

894
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,220
but like all great ideas,
sometimes they get contaminated with 

895
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,450
comments and that's constant.
The fact that people found out that it's

896
00:44:05,451 --> 00:44:06,870
a way to make easy money.
Well,

897
00:44:06,871 --> 00:44:11,520
the amount of money that they would win 
if they had station casinos turned union

898
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:13,580
is like in the millions and billions a 
year.

899
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,910
It's not even as much money as it is,
as much money,

900
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,180
but as much as it is money,
it's power and influence and.

901
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:23,570
Yeah,
and voting.

902
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,750
I mean it really is a national thing.
I remember every time because I was 

903
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,140
always.
I mean I'm.

904
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,040
If I had to put

905
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,790
a label on myself,
I'm right.

906
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,330
You know,
I would,

907
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,540
I would lean conservative,
I will lean to the right,

908
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,620
but I don't identify with either party,
but the union,

909
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:45,621
all,
every election would come up and they 

910
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:45,621
would say,
look,

911
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:47,931
you got to vote for the democrat no 
matter what because if not these 

912
00:44:47,931 --> 00:44:48,300
republicans,
they're gonna take your job,

913
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:49,950
they're going to rape your children,
you know,

914
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,450
they're going to put your wife in the 
basement.

915
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:56,280
And they were just.
And they were a single issue thing.

916
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,860
And to me,
you know,

917
00:44:58,890 --> 00:44:59,550
okay,
yeah,

918
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:01,290
if I vote for this,
I bought from my job,

919
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:04,260
but I'm also a voting against almost 
everything else I believe in.

920
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,060
So.
But if I.

921
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:08,790
And if I don't go that way,
then you're going to call me an asshole.

922
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,330
And I'm supposedly a union brother.
You know what I mean?

923
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,970
But if I decided to go a different way,
now I'm a prick.

924
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,480
Well,
that becomes a problem in almost any 

925
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:20,480
organization when you have very 
controlled,

926
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:25,850
you know,
you have a controlled environment where 

927
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:25,850
it's not based on the opinion of the 
masses you're,

928
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,310
you're supposed to go with the way that 
the head of the snake wants to go.

929
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:34,340
Exactly.
It becomes a problem in every single 

930
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:34,340
organization.
As soon as you.

931
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,120
There's some sort of a struggle,
rules or sat down,

932
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:38,910
everything becomes defined.
Now it's an ideology.

933
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:41,610
Now you're part of a tribe.
Now it goes bad.

934
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,930
It's just we don't do good like that 
man.

935
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,000
When it's us versus them,
it's almost always,

936
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:53,001
it turns out shitty.
It's like you've got to realize there's 

937
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:53,001
no them.
It's,

938
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:53,990
you know,
we make everybody us because it's,

939
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
it is possible as a human race to make 
everybody else doesn't have to be an us 

940
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,511
versus them.
It's just you have to find out the 

941
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:02,610
elements of society that are 
problematic.

942
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:04,540
And figuring out how to fix them or root
them out.

943
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,210
But you know what,
I think since time began,

944
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:12,270
somewhere there was a fucking cave man 
standing on top of whatever the hill 

945
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:18,481
was.
It had the best shade and the cleanest 

946
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:20,311
water and you know,
and that's all day if you look 

947
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:25,531
throughout the world.
I mean in America we've been able to 

948
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:27,100
pretty it up,
sand the edges off,

949
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:30,340
you know,
we make it look nice and uh,

950
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,560
but it's the same shit.

951
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,670
It's exactly the same shit.
When you see obama decrying the use of 

952
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,941
chemical weapons,
think about how many motherfuckers have 

953
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:40,941
died by drones.
It's like,

954
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:41,310
come on,
son,

955
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,370
that's ridiculous.
Well,

956
00:46:42,371 --> 00:46:47,371
you're doing is.
It's okay to use robots to shoot 

957
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,410
hellfire missiles from the sky,
but it's not okay to use chemicals.

958
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,920
Come on.
You're being silly,

959
00:46:50,921 --> 00:46:51,530
man.
Yeah,

960
00:46:51,531 --> 00:46:52,180
it's,
I,

961
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,820
and I agree.
It's,

962
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,940
I tell you what,
man,

963
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:59,941
I was really surprised that you got to 
hand it to putin for how he handled that

964
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:01,600
situation.
He's gangsters.

965
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,150
I mean,
he made obama look like a child.

966
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:04,920
Well,
he makes it.

967
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:06,700
Obama look like a child on a regular.
Did you,

968
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,430
did you hear about the time they met at 
this conference?

969
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:13,431
We're supposed to be at this conference 
in obama's people wanted the gym at the 

970
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,810
same time that putin wanted the gym and 
there was a scheduling conflict,

971
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,300
so putin said,
I don't give a shit,

972
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,030
let them have the gym.
So he went swimming in the lake,

973
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:26,060
outside of the gym.
Pooter jumps in the lake and he's doing 

974
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,931
laps in the fucking lake out there with 
nature while obama's aerobics scrunchy

975
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,230
socks.
Puente is gangster as fuck.

976
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:39,160
He goes fly fishing,
bare chested fucking buffaloes.

977
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,010
And yeah,
he's a savage and I don't know if that's

978
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:43,810
good or bad.
I don't know if it's good or bad.

979
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:48,040
I guess it's bad if his enemy.
There's a great documentary that I think

980
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:51,560
it's the canadian broadcast cbc did,
I think it's called the putin.

981
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:52,750
Putin,
putin,

982
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:57,751
whatever the fuck his name is the putin 
system and it traces his history from 

983
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:02,830
the time he was in college to now and 
how he got to where he is.

984
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,220
And uh,
we'll get that greetings from Russia,

985
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,650
south selfish in it.
Shit.

986
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:14,270
They had some bastard.
And while balding somehow manages to 

987
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,100
carry it well,
but that program,

988
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,650
I guess when he was,
uh,

989
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,260
in high school,
he went to a kgb office and said,

990
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:23,170
I want to be in the fucking kgb,
and the kgb said,

991
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:25,390
we'll tell you he was going to be in the
fucking kgb,

992
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,450
but if you are,
this is what we're looking for.

993
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,430
So he went to college and basically 
followed the guidance he was given.

994
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:38,740
And sure enough they tapped him when he 
was in college and he went into the kgb,

995
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,980
the old school,
this is Russia missiles pointed at us,

996
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,770
you know,
and uh,

997
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,920
but that's how you got to start.
And people that are fucking smarter than

998
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:54,070
me that have been all over the world and
I paid attention to what they say,

999
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,290
all say that this guy is a problem.
I mean,

1000
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:04,291
he's going to be a fucking issue.
And if you look at what he's done the 

1001
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:05,470
last 15 years,
you know,

1002
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:08,830
I mean,
he was president of Russia and then term

1003
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:10,210
limits kicked in or whatever.
And he was like,

1004
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:11,470
okay,
I can't be president,

1005
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:15,860
I'll be fucking prime minister.
And so he has a b,

1006
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,480
he,
alexis,

1007
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:17,580
buddy,
you know,

1008
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,470
president or whatever his term ends.
And he goes,

1009
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:22,180
okay,
I'm going to be president again.

1010
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,460
So I mean,
this guy,

1011
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,980
he's just,
he's,

1012
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,500
he's a fucking gangster and he needs to 
be respected.

1013
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,600
But there's a notice in the us.
It's like there's this feeling that all,

1014
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:36,220
he's a cool guy,
you know,

1015
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,600
he's,
you know,

1016
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,250
he's not a cool guy.
Well,

1017
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:41,550
there's a lot of confusion in the us 
that's amongst

1018
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,480
a,
what I'll call progressive kids.

1019
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:49,110
Um,
it's a young people that their heart is 

1020
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,741
in the right place and they are,
they have some good ideas about the 

1021
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,080
inequalities of the world,
but they approached them in a very 

1022
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,841
strange way.
Like people in progressive people will 

1023
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:05,910
consistently talk about islamophobia and
they will talk about how,

1024
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:07,450
you know,
the,

1025
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:12,451
the,
the restrictions on people's religious 

1026
00:50:12,451 --> 00:50:13,470
freedoms that are muslim,
uh,

1027
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:14,840
people,
uh,

1028
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,980
that are islamic,
that this is like a really horrendous 

1029
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,140
piece of racism.
Yet they will openly criticize 

1030
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:26,610
christianity.
Oh yeah.

1031
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,640
Openly,
I'm a mockingly

1032
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,880
criticized mormonism,
openly mockingly criticize in.

1033
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:37,010
And it's like as any smart person would 
know,

1034
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,540
blank,
you know,

1035
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:43,570
and,
but yet islam is because these people 

1036
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,941
are brown because the idea that they had
been marginalized because many people 

1037
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:46,970
that are from that culture are not 
violent at all,

1038
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:48,770
just like many christians are not 
violent at all.

1039
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:53,030
And they should not be defined by the 
most radical,

1040
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,010
the most radical aspects of their 
religion.

1041
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,110
I agree with that wholeheartedly.
One hundred percent.

1042
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,440
But I don't ever see progressive people 
getting on people for making fun of 

1043
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:02,440
christians.
It's like,

1044
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,490
it's directly a part of the program.

1045
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,760
Got to have their whipping boy,
you know.

1046
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,520
Yeah.
It's interesting.

1047
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,820
That was kind of one of the things that,
uh,

1048
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:17,410
I don't know what it is in this country.
It seems in particular with the whole 

1049
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,860
fucking hipster thing,
which,

1050
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,340
you know,
but it seems like,

1051
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,590
you know,
when I was,

1052
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,340
and I don't want to get into the um,
uh,

1053
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,040
because I am getting to be an old 
motherfucker.

1054
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:31,980
But you know,
to me when I was raised up,

1055
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,000
it was,
you know,

1056
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:38,380
you,
you were taught that it was okay to be 

1057
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,330
proud of where you're from or where you 
grew up and their struggles and,

1058
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:42,360
and you know,
you were taught fucking history,

1059
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,770
you know,
I mean,

1060
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:48,771
I look now,
I talked to some kids like high school 

1061
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:49,950
kids,
friends of mine's kids that are 13,

1062
00:51:49,951 --> 00:51:51,330
14,
15 years old.

1063
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,440
And I asked them,
you know,

1064
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:57,750
you know,
just about any kind of american history 

1065
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,300
and some of the shit they tell me just 
blows my fucking mind.

1066
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,120
Most of it is what they don't know,
you know?

1067
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,280
And then they all know almost nothing.
Right?

1068
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,210
And how it's all being tilted.
And I'll tell you,

1069
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:13,380
here's a perfect fucking example.
There's a great video I was watching and

1070
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:18,220
it was a guy giving a talk on the 
constitution and he asked,

1071
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:20,950
he had a room full of this guy.
It was a,

1072
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
a class and a firearm school.
So you've got a bunch of right wing 

1073
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,760
fucking,
you know,

1074
00:52:26,761 --> 00:52:30,750
the left would say,
god loving gun toting these guys,

1075
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:33,000
you know,
constitutional guys.

1076
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:37,410
You would think so.
He says he starts off in the ass,

1077
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,800
you know,
basically named me the four members of 

1078
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,351
the simpsons family.
Everyone in that fucking place could 

1079
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:45,660
name him all four members of the 
simpsons.

1080
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,510
He said,
now named me the four rights,

1081
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:53,511
guaranteed you under the first amendment
of the constitution and nobody could do 

1082
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:54,930
it.
These are adults.

1083
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,780
I couldn't do it.
I could name me three,

1084
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,060
but I couldn't taste the fourth.
What are they?

1085
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,280
The right to petition your government 
for redress,

1086
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,800
right to assembly.
Freedom of the press.

1087
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:06,600
Freedom of religion.
Huh?

1088
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,320
Those are the four rights.
Guaranteed you under the first 

1089
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:12,320
amendment.

1090
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,340
Isn't it fascinating that even back then
they were engineering against tyranny?

1091
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,720
Fuck yes.
They will know.

1092
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,500
They were like,
listen,

1093
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:19,920
this kid get back like we have a good 
idea right now and we're,

1094
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:20,400
we're,
we're,

1095
00:53:20,401 --> 00:53:25,401
we're establishing in here right now,
but this could get back if it gets 

1096
00:53:25,401 --> 00:53:26,190
infected with the very concert it right 
now.

1097
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Go back and you look at the shit they 
did and what happens is everybody,

1098
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:39,180
you know,
the people on the other side of this 

1099
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:39,180
marginalized it because they say,
oh,

1100
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:39,510
well they owned slaves.
Oh,

1101
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:39,960
well,
okay.

1102
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:42,510
Four fifths of a man or whatever,
you know,

1103
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,800
in a marginalized,
all the good shit by the bad shit.

1104
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:47,930
You know,
and,

1105
00:53:47,931 --> 00:53:48,900
and,
and that's true.

1106
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,960
Yeah.
Some of the shit they did didn't make 

1107
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:53,960
sense,
but that doesn't mean the shit that they

1108
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,340
did do that does make sense is 
irrelevant.

1109
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:01,510
Well,
it doesn't make sense today and that's 

1110
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,001
what people have to understand.
There's things that we do today that 

1111
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:05,180
will be considered barbaric a thousand 
years from now.

1112
00:54:05,181 --> 00:54:10,181
There's no doubt about it.
There's privatized prisons will be 

1113
00:54:10,181 --> 00:54:12,110
looked down upon with incredible 
contempt and scorn.

1114
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:15,680
Privatized prisons will go down in 
history as one of the most ignored,

1115
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:21,490
horrific injustices.
The idea that people can profit and and 

1116
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,880
that they can spend their money to make 
sure that people get locked up more 

1117
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,220
often so that they can profit.
It's incredibly insane.

1118
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:33,610
There's a lot of shit that's going to go
down in our future into the future of 

1119
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:37,721
human beings where this day will be 
criticized openly for human rights 

1120
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:38,290
violations,
all the shit that we're,

1121
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,320
we were talking about earlier where 
you're allowing people to work in a 

1122
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,011
foreign country,
third world country for a fraction of 

1123
00:54:48,011 --> 00:54:48,830
the amount of money that it would take 
your key in ensuring poverty,

1124
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,560
you know,
taking full advantage on disenfranchised

1125
00:54:51,561 --> 00:54:54,140
human beings that's going to be looked 
in the future upon,

1126
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,340
you know,
they're going to look on that.

1127
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,350
That's a horrific thing.
Just like slavery,

1128
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:57,720
but

1129
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,310
you know what,
at the same time,

1130
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,900
uh,
you know,

1131
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:05,901
if you're a guy in China and your 
options are maybe starve to death if the

1132
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:11,370
fucking rains don't come that year or go
work for,

1133
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:16,580
you know,
a dollar a day and a nike factory and 

1134
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,320
living in a dormitory and work your ass 
off from dawn to dusk,

1135
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:20,550
but you're going to eat,
you know,

1136
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:21,210
it.
It's,

1137
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,540
you know,
one of the best things that I was 

1138
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:26,540
watching.
I forget what the fuck it was,

1139
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,360
but a guy wasn't thomas friedman.
Um,

1140
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:34,220
maybe once friedman,
but he was talking about like what's 

1141
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,420
going on in China right now?
It's like the last 100 years of american

1142
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:39,560
history all going on at the same time.
Wow.

1143
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,110
Because you're going from the grid and 
certain parts of the country.

1144
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:46,010
It's going from an agrarian society,
you know,

1145
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,540
to where basically it was almost 
subsistence farming,

1146
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,340
you know,
they would raise crops,

1147
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:51,660
it would sell and that's what they did.

1148
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:55,020
You went up,
you work every day so you didn't fucking

1149
00:55:55,021 --> 00:55:58,800
starving the winter.
And then you've got other parts that are

1150
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:03,801
going through almost the early 19 
hundreds with the industrial revolution 

1151
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:09,231
and all the problems go through that.
And then you go to certain parts of it 

1152
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:12,021
and it's cutting edge 21st century 
technology and finance and everything 

1153
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:16,791
else.
But you've got all this going on in one 

1154
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,450
country and that's,
you know,

1155
00:56:18,451 --> 00:56:21,780
that's kind of like a microcosm of 
what's going on all over the world.

1156
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:27,140
When you go to these certain places like
Malaysia or Bangladesh or some of these 

1157
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,780
other fucked up countries,
you know,

1158
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,160
can you blame a guy for going?
And so in shoes for a dollar a day,

1159
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:34,960
if there's another option is to starve 
to death.

1160
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:35,380
No,
I,

1161
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,530
I totally is the guy who comes and 
brings that job,

1162
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,040
you know,
is he a complete fucking asshole for 

1163
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:44,040
doing it or you know.

1164
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:44,040
Yeah,
no,

1165
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,220
there's,
there's that argument.

1166
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,850
It's like many things in life.
There's no real black and white.

1167
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,350
There's a lot of.
I don't know the answer.

1168
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:51,430
I mean it's like,
to me,

1169
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:55,330
I see if you're a hardcore capitalist 
than,

1170
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,810
and I believe in capitalism,
then it's,

1171
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,910
you know,
then you,

1172
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,960
you know,
if the smart that can adapt and 

1173
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,420
improvise and adapt will,
will prosper.

1174
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,070
And if perfect example like me,
you know,

1175
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,840
I mean I was a fucking auto worker and 
it was,

1176
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,550
it was a mindless job.
It was retarded how much money they paid

1177
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:22,870
us to do this shit.
I'll be the first one to tell you $32 an

1178
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:26,860
hour to take this and go like that.
I mean over and over and over.

1179
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:31,980
It was fucking crazy and benefits better
than almost anyone in the country from 

1180
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,960
the time I was born until december of 
2006,

1181
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,610
almost never paid the doctor bill.

1182
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Wow.
Because I was covered under that 

1183
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,310
program.
That's incredible.

1184
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,340
Yeah.
Eyeglasses all pretty much free.

1185
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,470
I mean,
just everything.

1186
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:52,710
How much more money must be they've been
making now and they were making back 

1187
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,730
then.
The profit margins are supposed to be 

1188
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:55,730
insane.
You would think.

1189
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:56,500
I mean,
I haven't kept up with the auto industry

1190
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,890
because it was one of those things to 
where I lived it every day,

1191
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:05,220
you know,
it was you at one point when I was 

1192
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,371
there,
you could ask the dumbest toothless 

1193
00:58:08,371 --> 00:58:09,670
looking motherfucker on the floor what 
the stock price that day.

1194
00:58:09,671 --> 00:58:11,830
And he could probably tell you,
wow.

1195
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,020
Because there was profit sharing.
Wow.

1196
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,680
The stock was up.
We're getting a check.

1197
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,930
Wow.
That's incredible.

1198
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,700
Yeah.
But uh,

1199
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:23,410
and everybody was like,
you know what?

1200
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,480
And mexicans not going to get a check.
They get a dollar an hour and no check.

1201
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,150
The rest of that money goes to us.

1202
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,870
One of the things that they used to tell
us,

1203
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:37,871
and I don't know,
I've never seen a fucking mexican auto 

1204
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:40,001
plant,
but they said that one of the biggest 

1205
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:43,111
differences when you looked at a mexican
autoplant compared to an american 

1206
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:46,390
autoplant mexican auto plants don't have
parking lots because their workers don't

1207
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:50,690
have cars.
They don't drive the bus.

1208
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,890
They bused them in or they want 
something happened.

1209
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:55,360
Man,
I don't know what the fuck happened,

1210
00:58:55,361 --> 00:59:00,361
but something absolutely happen in the 
design aspect of american cars where 

1211
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:05,461
they went from the coolest looking 
fucking things of all time to shit in 10

1212
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,220
years called,
I think it was corporate.

1213
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:13,510
If you go back and you look at the cool 
fucking cars,

1214
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,170
so we're done with the corvette.
Carroll shelby,

1215
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,490
you know,
if you're a weirdo,

1216
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:20,080
you go into the fifties.
Yeah,

1217
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:21,980
if you're a weirdo,
but if you're a

1218
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,500
regular guy who appreciates a muscle 
car,

1219
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,970
you stay in the sixties to about 73.
Oh,

1220
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:28,550
seven.
Yeah.

1221
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:30,200
Well that was the.
Was it cafe?

1222
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:31,650
Was that what it was?
Was having three.

1223
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,620
They came out with that fucked up 
chevelle,

1224
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,110
chevelle that looked like shit with the 
mustang

1225
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,800
two and all that bullshit.
And like the early mid seventies.

1226
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:43,530
But that was insurance and gas,
you know,

1227
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:45,350
it's right when they made them put in 
the.

1228
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,200
You couldn't have a car that got for me.

1229
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,470
Yeah.
They,

1230
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,600
the catalytic converters.
And on switching to unleaded gasoline,

1231
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:57,570
that was all that harmed the muscle 
cars.

1232
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,810
You know,
I was thinking about it today,

1233
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,370
about,
on the way over here,

1234
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,140
um,
you know,

1235
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:08,141
you hear all like now the government 
shut down all this shit and people are 

1236
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:08,141
saying,
you know,

1237
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:10,940
the United States could default on the 
debt and we could all end up fucked.

1238
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,010
And you hear all the gloom and doom 
scenarios.

1239
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,230
But I was thinking about it and I 
thought,

1240
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,770
you know what man,
I'm old enough to remember gas lines.

1241
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:20,750
You know,
I was a kid.

1242
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,120
I was a little kid.
But I remember that.

1243
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,740
And I remember people talking about it 
and just,

1244
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,130
you know,
when everybody was out of work,

1245
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,270
carter was president,
you know,

1246
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,840
I was born in [inaudible] 73.
So I remember,

1247
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:33,170
um,
you know,

1248
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,580
like five,
six years old,

1249
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:37,790
shit like that,
but you know,

1250
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:39,950
and it's not that bad yet.
No,

1251
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:44,980
but the difference is with social media,
everyone is so much more connected now 

1252
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,200
because back then you know,
the only time you got your global fix 

1253
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,810
was at 30 minutes at night between five 
and 5:30

1254
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:58,811
or 6:00
when the news was on and now you can't 

1255
01:00:58,811 --> 01:00:58,811
fucking get away from it.

1256
01:00:58,811 --> 01:01:02,320
It must have been so easy to run the 
world back then think about it.

1257
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:07,500
And they still,
they still Got busted with that oliver 

1258
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,370
north thing and that was still on tv 
even back then,

1259
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:14,610
which is hard to believe because it 
must've been so easy to hide shit and It

1260
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:16,450
still just blew up in their face.

1261
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:22,110
I'm reading a book right now,
I'll call it the way of the knife and 

1262
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,961
it's a book about how basically like 
we're talking about the drone shit and 

1263
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,500
to where the kind of the cia boondoggles
or the sixties,

1264
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:36,730
like they were trying to poison fucking 
castro and all this other bullshit.

1265
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,070
And congress basically called them on 
it.

1266
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:42,910
So it was at ford,
I can't remember the president,

1267
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:48,390
but basically wrote the presidential 
order that says no fucking 

1268
01:01:48,611 --> 01:01:50,530
assassination,
you know,

1269
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,640
you assholes,
kinda no one in the gut.

1270
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:55,060
You can't assassinate another foreign 
official.

1271
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:00,420
It's illegal no more.
And that was the stop all the bullshit 

1272
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,160
with the cia and because they were kind 
of running rogue,

1273
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:06,640
they're not only with castro but in 
other parts of the world.

1274
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,850
And uh,
it goes on.

1275
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:13,030
And then the guy makes a pretty 
interesting,

1276
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:18,330
you know,
progress of how we got from that to 

1277
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:18,490
after september,
you know,

1278
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:19,350
nine slash 11.

1279
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,500
It was like,
okay,

1280
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,290
well let's burn that motherfucker 
because now we're killing everybody.

1281
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:30,770
And so,
and that's where we are today with this 

1282
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:33,990
shit to where.
And what's crazy is a bush.

1283
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:38,010
I was talking to a dude,
he was an instructor at a training class

1284
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:42,780
I was at and a ex special forces guy did
like 20 years.

1285
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,670
One of the most intelligent dudes I've 
ever met.

1286
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:47,250
I've been all over the world on 
everything fucking twice.

1287
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,530
And we were talking about.
And he goes,

1288
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:52,410
you know,
people bitch about obama,

1289
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,050
about,
you know,

1290
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:58,110
he's weak on this week on that,
but when bush was in office,

1291
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:03,111
they have I think 30 or 40 drone strikes
in Pakistan and then when obama came in,

1292
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:10,250
hundreds were killing motherfuckers,
like it's free and he's just like,

1293
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,100
you know,
so the guys that are on the ground doing

1294
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:16,080
this shit or like,
fuck yeah,

1295
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,400
you know,
and it's,

1296
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,790
it's crazy though.
There's a fucking target list.

1297
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:25,710
There's a list that if your fucking name
is on it and you're in Pakistan,

1298
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,860
you're fucked.
Yeah,

1299
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:30,200
right.
Exactly.

1300
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,980
Find out Where you are.
Missiles are coming from the sky and you

1301
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:37,981
ain't gonna make it.
And a lot of times fucking obama asked 

1302
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:38,740
to check off on that.
Yeah.

1303
01:03:38,741 --> 01:03:43,741
And the amount of people that get killed
that you're supposed to kill versus the 

1304
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:44,860
amount of people that accidentally get 
killed.

1305
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:47,740
Boy,
is that a shocking number?

1306
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:53,050
But 98 percent the wrong people,
does it?

1307
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:54,330
Is that,
I mean,

1308
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,860
yes,
that what I've read.

1309
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:59,130
I mean obviously I'm not out there 
fucking counting bodies.

1310
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:03,160
I'm not giving you the most accurate 
readings humanly possible.

1311
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:05,710
I'm getting it based on a bunch of 
different things I've read online,

1312
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,260
but I don't know.
I mean sources.

1313
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:08,760
I could see that

1314
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:11,470
there's a lot of fuck ups,
but it's in the nineties.

1315
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:16,530
I'm going to guess that you know,
I don't know maybe,

1316
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:22,060
but I could definitely see six guys 
being in a car.

1317
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:26,060
One of them being the guy,
you know,

1318
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:28,130
there's a lot of guilt by association 
going,

1319
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,980
there is no doubt about that and there's
no doubt about that.

1320
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:35,070
If they get a chance to take you out and
you happen to be with your friends,

1321
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,940
this is a time of war and they're not 
gonna miss out on that opportunity.

1322
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:44,250
The certain amount of casualties that 
are factored into every war and that's 

1323
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,510
just a fact of life and if you're a key 
target,

1324
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,760
that's a rap song.
We have this new thing.

1325
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:50,460
It's called a drone shoots hellfire 
missiles.

1326
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,740
Hello,
hellfire missile.

1327
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:57,080
Hellfire missile.
Gangster motherfuckers.

1328
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,090
That was one of the things that

1329
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:02,380
they were talking about in this book on 
about how they were able,

1330
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:08,090
you know,
Pakistan has been playing in the United 

1331
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:10,500
States since the shift began because I 
mean the taliban was created by fucking 

1332
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:15,271
Pakistan.
I thought the taliban came out of the 

1333
01:05:15,271 --> 01:05:18,001
mujahideen know the taliban was 
basically created and by the isi.

1334
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,340
Did al qaeda come out of the mujahideen?
Yes.

1335
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:24,640
I mean the taliban is a branch of al 
qaeda,

1336
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:25,360
right?
No.

1337
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:30,390
The taliban taliban was set up basically
by Pakistan to after,

1338
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:35,410
after Russia pulled out of Afghanistan,
fucking nobody to run it.

1339
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:40,330
It's warlords and wild west.
The isi,

1340
01:05:40,331 --> 01:05:45,130
the pakistani intelligence service put 
together and backed this group.

1341
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:47,560
They call themselves the taliban.
Basically.

1342
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:51,730
Fundamentalist guys helped them gain 
power,

1343
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:56,610
consolidate power in Afghanistan.
The reason was the biggest thing,

1344
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,560
Pakistan doesn't give a fuck about 
Afghanistan,

1345
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:01,600
about anything.
The only thing they give a shit about is

1346
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:02,050
India.

1347
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,280
Pakistan is scared to fucking death of 
India and if we see a nuclear war and 

1348
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,951
our time,
it will probably be between India and 

1349
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:13,090
Pakistan is my bed,
but so what they didn't want.

1350
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,540
If you look at a map,
where the fuck is Afghanistan?

1351
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:22,030
India's here,
afghanistan's on the back door of 

1352
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:22,030
Pakistan.
So what?

1353
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:26,461
Pakistan doesn't want,
what they can afford is to have an 

1354
01:06:26,461 --> 01:06:28,000
indian client state and have India on 
borders.

1355
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,480
So the taliban was there a way around 
that.

1356
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:37,050
The taliban ran controlled Afghanistan.
They didn't run it because there's parts

1357
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:40,600
of that fucking country that you can't 
run.

1358
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:46,080
But.
So that was what the taliban was 

1359
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:46,480
basically,
they're strong man that they put in.

1360
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:52,080
Well they fucked up when bin laden came 
in and they sheltered him and did all 

1361
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,861
this shit and they pissed off America.
So now here comes America in october of 

1362
01:06:57,070 --> 01:07:01,930
2001 and just raise holy hell goes up,
gets the northern alliance,

1363
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:02,830
pushes them out.

1364
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:06,580
Well,
during all this shit was going on,

1365
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,640
pakistan's flying fucking taliban 
leaders out before they can get captured

1366
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:14,830
by the us the whole time they're telling
us,

1367
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,880
oh yeah,
go get this guy,

1368
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:20,881
go get that guy.
So Pakistan has always given up the 

1369
01:07:20,881 --> 01:07:24,451
aiccu guys.
I mean the conspiracy theory side is 

1370
01:07:24,451 --> 01:07:25,510
that the government allowed those people
to leave.

1371
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,560
No,
absolutely.

1372
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,010
I don't think it's a conspiracy.
I think it's kind of everybody I know.

1373
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:35,100
I mean they talked to you guys and this 
is all a part of their relationship 

1374
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:35,960
with.
Well,

1375
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:37,640
they they want,
you know,

1376
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,750
Pakistan is not.
They'll give up the foreign fighters,

1377
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,330
you know,
the assholes that are coming in,

1378
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:45,040
the al qaeda guy,
stuff like that.

1379
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:50,490
I mean they've proven that they've 
captured al qaeda guys and turned them 

1380
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:51,310
over to the us.
I mean they have a history of that.

1381
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:56,340
They have a hIstory of throwing us a 
bone because they know they can't just 

1382
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,190
go.
It's going to be one of the other.

1383
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:02,250
Well,
I think that there's a lot of profit in 

1384
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:05,371
war,
especially if it stays active and I 

1385
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:09,631
think the idea of completely resolving 
all the issues that you have in ending 

1386
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,620
the war is not very profitable and 
that's a fact.

1387
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:15,100
There's look,
one of the most profitable things ever.

1388
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,460
The history of humanity

1389
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,150
is the drug war.
Fuck.

1390
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,800
The drug war does not have an ending.
There's no,

1391
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,300
there's no resolution.
It's never gonna happen.

1392
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:26,140
You're never going to stop people.
Especially with the hypocrite,

1393
01:08:26,141 --> 01:08:31,141
a lot hypocritical attitude that we have
as a culture where we allow certain 

1394
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:35,171
drugs and often those drugs,
the more dangerous ones we allow those 

1395
01:08:35,171 --> 01:08:36,680
to be legal,
but the more peaceful,

1396
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:41,860
enlightening,
opening drugs that allow you to step 

1397
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,960
outside of your normal predetermined 
patterns of behavior and sort of look at

1398
01:08:44,961 --> 01:08:47,810
the world for what it really is.
Those are the ones that are Illegal.

1399
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,960
It's a clear sign of a society repressed
and when a society's repressed it 

1400
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:55,850
fucking results.
It has a freak out

1401
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,000
to me.
I think it all comes down.

1402
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:01,150
I don't give a fuck whatever the 
substance or item,

1403
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:05,670
whatever it is that the government says 
you can't have it.

1404
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,050
It's about,
you know,

1405
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,940
like I'm a gun guy,
so that's my issue.

1406
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,790
You know,
gun control is not about guns.

1407
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:14,860
It's about control.
It's the same.

1408
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,750
Jamie,
can we get some supplies?

1409
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,350
It's the same shit with drugs.
Yeah.

1410
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,260
And what's crazy to me,
what blows my fucking mind?

1411
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,000
Perfect example.
Okay.

1412
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,330
I'm,
I'm driving today from vegas.

1413
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:34,060
Alright.
There's this arbitrary fucking line in 

1414
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:34,660
the desert between Nevada and 
California.

1415
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:37,360
Okay.
Now in Nevada,

1416
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:40,750
I have a concealed carry permit.
I can carry a gun legally,

1417
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,450
exercise my second amendment right.
It's bullshit,

1418
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,740
but I have to pay money and go through a
class and to jump through these hoops to

1419
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:52,741
exercise this right in the first place,
but I can exercise it if I play their 

1420
01:09:52,741 --> 01:09:53,140
game.
Now,

1421
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:55,150
if I'm standing on this side of the 
line,

1422
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:58,840
I'm 100 percent fucking illegal.
if I step over this line,

1423
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:04,800
I'm going to jail for for the same shit.
now it's the same way with drugs.

1424
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:10,110
If you got a bag of weed in California 
and you've got the right card from the 

1425
01:10:10,571 --> 01:10:12,280
right doctor,
you're straight.

1426
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah,
but if you go to Texas,

1427
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:18,740
they will fuck you up.
You are you.

1428
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:23,660
Are you in favor of any laws as far as 
like regulation of who gets firearms?

1429
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,090
I think we've got plenty man.
Are you.

1430
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:29,870
You are in favor of background checks 
and shit like that?

1431
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,330
yeah.
Yeah.

1432
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:34,270
I mean it's.
I should say.

1433
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,320
Yeah,
I mean I don't.

1434
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,440
I think so.
Such a gun nut?

1435
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:40,500
No,
I should say most people at right home,

1436
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:42,880
like all the liberal freaks right now.
What?

1437
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,270
I'm no hero,
she slept 69 on whether,

1438
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,700
I

1439
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,730
mean I can see it and I,
and I don't,

1440
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:51,260
I don't disagree with that,
but here's,

1441
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:57,580
if I could rule the world,
I would have no problem with instant 

1442
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:58,280
background checks.
It shouldn't cost a dime.

1443
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:02,480
Like now up until in las vegas,
in Nevada,

1444
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,380
if you buy a gun,
it costs you $25 to pay for a background

1445
01:11:06,381 --> 01:11:07,940
check.
Right now.

1446
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,830
That background check consists of 
someone in a government office somewhere

1447
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,930
typing your name and the computer.
That's it.

1448
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:16,730
And,
and,

1449
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:19,950
and if you get a hit,
they'll deny you and then you have three

1450
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:23,490
days to appeal.
but if you don't,

1451
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:26,490
they say he's good.
So you're against the fact that it costs

1452
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:29,370
25 bucks.
That and the fact I don't have a problem

1453
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:31,080
with instant checks.
I think that's fair.

1454
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:31,740
I mean,
I,

1455
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,570
and I,
I do agree with that.

1456
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:38,990
Um,
but when I have a problem with is the 

1457
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:40,590
fact that you loved guns.

1458
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,650
No,
it's not,

1459
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:45,030
that's not it.
It's just the fact that if I,

1460
01:11:45,031 --> 01:11:46,740
okay,
if I charged you,

1461
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:53,140
I dunno if I charged you a fee for every
podcast you put up because you're 

1462
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:55,020
exercising your first amendment right 
and we have to make sure joe,

1463
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:59,470
that you're using this right correctly,
that you're not inciting any violence or

1464
01:11:59,471 --> 01:12:01,640
are trying to incite any,
you know,

1465
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,930
you could do any damage to the 
establishment.

1466
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,630
I see what you're saying.
And so,

1467
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:12,020
but to me it comes down to.
And one thing I have a big problem with 

1468
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,680
and it's something that if you're not a 
gun guy,

1469
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,930
you'd never even fucking pay attention 
to,

1470
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:19,380
but it's this thing called the nfa 
national firearms act,

1471
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:22,390
the registry and what that is,
it's,

1472
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:25,200
there's,
there's these arbitrary laws that say,

1473
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,830
okay,
if you want to own a suppressor silencer

1474
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:31,110
or something like that,
or a fully automatic weapon,

1475
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:32,610
whatever,
um,

1476
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:34,620
you can do that.

1477
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:40,010
If it's legal in your state,
you're perfectly fine to be able to do 

1478
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:43,491
that.
But you have to pay the government 200 

1479
01:12:43,491 --> 01:12:45,270
bucks.
So if you pay the government 200 bucks,

1480
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:50,390
we'll give you this shit.
And also you have to give up the right 

1481
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:55,131
to let anybody from the atf come into 
your home anytime they want to check on 

1482
01:12:55,131 --> 01:12:57,720
that.
So if you do this,

1483
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:00,480
you can have this.
You can have fucking damn near anything.

1484
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:04,200
I mean machine guns,
50 caliber machine guns,

1485
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:09,201
you can add anything.
I know guys that have got any fucking 

1486
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:10,470
thing you can dream up as long as you're
willing to pay the government.

1487
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:14,130
Now to me,
that's bullshit.

1488
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,230
I see what you're saying.
I see the point.

1489
01:13:16,231 --> 01:13:19,050
But I also see the point that you have 
to regulate.

1490
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:24,110
You have to keep aware of who the 
fucking crazy people are because that's 

1491
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:24,110
the problem that many people.

1492
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:25,800
I don't have a problem with keeping guns
away from naughty people.

1493
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:30,801
Right?
But you have to have employees that do 

1494
01:13:30,801 --> 01:13:30,801
that.
They have got.

1495
01:13:30,801 --> 01:13:30,801
No,
that's fine.

1496
01:13:30,801 --> 01:13:32,580
It cost money to do so let's do that.
But are we doing that now?

1497
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,960
We're not.
No.

1498
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,480
You know why you can't keep guns away 
from 90 people?

1499
01:13:36,481 --> 01:13:38,760
Because medical records are restricted.
Yeah.

1500
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,550
Is that what it is?
I think you can keep some guns away from

1501
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:43,470
somebody in here.
Well,

1502
01:13:43,471 --> 01:13:48,471
the only way is if they're adjudicated 
by a judge and there's a public record 

1503
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:51,720
of it and it goes into a record,
but most cases,

1504
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,090
like all,
almost all these shootings,

1505
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:59,150
like if you look at all of this is what 
fires people up about guns is the mass 

1506
01:13:59,161 --> 01:14:01,890
shootings and it's completely 
understandable.

1507
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:07,490
But for most part,
if you look at the guys who were doing 

1508
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:09,900
these shootings,
they're nuts.

1509
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:11,080
They're fucked up.
Yeah.

1510
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:16,090
Now,
if you start looking at the number of 

1511
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:16,240
people who do these shootings that are 
on some type of drug,

1512
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,460
huge,
you know,

1513
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,240
so if we're really trying to stop,
you know,

1514
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:26,310
are we,
are we going after the tool or are we 

1515
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:28,981
trying to stop the tool?
Are we trying to stop the act because 

1516
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:29,320
you know,
which one is it?

1517
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,550
No,
it's a very good point.

1518
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:33,940
I've said it many times and so,
I mean,

1519
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,210
I don't know.
I'm probably not the right guy to get up

1520
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:39,700
here and talk about what should and 
shouldn't be with guns.

1521
01:14:39,701 --> 01:14:40,890
I mean,
uh,

1522
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:41,930
you know,
I'll,

1523
01:14:41,931 --> 01:14:45,490
I'll be the first to admit I'm biased,
but I'm also the same guy that was stand

1524
01:14:45,491 --> 01:14:50,491
up here and tell you,
I think every drug on earth should be 

1525
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:50,491
illegal.

1526
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:54,220
Yeah.
But you know what I mean when you say 

1527
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:54,220
you're not the right guy,
this is what I believe.

1528
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:58,420
I believe there is no right guy.
I think that your ideas of what should 

1529
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:02,801
and should be legal or different than 
other people's ideas and what you'll 

1530
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:04,850
tolerate are different than things are 
different than people who,

1531
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:09,560
you know otherwise would have no 
agreements with you about everything,

1532
01:15:09,561 --> 01:15:14,561
but there might be certain things,
certain behaviors that you're used to 

1533
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:15,710
that they can't handle.
People are fucking different.

1534
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:16,510
Man.
You know,

1535
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,320
I don't think there's any right or 
wrong,

1536
01:15:18,321 --> 01:15:23,321
but I think the real issue is a guy like
you who's not a bad guy who is a gun 

1537
01:15:25,251 --> 01:15:30,251
enthusiast also realizes he's aware that
there's a lot of fucking bad things in 

1538
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:34,781
the world and I would rather be 
protected than not be protected very 

1539
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:34,781
simply.

1540
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:37,170
Well,
my then there in lies probably my,

1541
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:39,630
that's your number one beef.
My,

1542
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,770
my thing is I do not expect the 
government to protect me.

1543
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,540
yes,
it's not their job.

1544
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:47,340
It's you can't.
If the,

1545
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:49,500
if,
if you get robbed,

1546
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:50,490
raped,
beaten,

1547
01:15:50,491 --> 01:15:55,491
or killed your family or you cannot sue 
the police because they didn't protect 

1548
01:15:55,771 --> 01:15:58,650
you.
It's not the police's job.

1549
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:02,340
It's not the state's job to protect you 
as an individual.

1550
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,970
You can't sue the cops if you get beat 
up,

1551
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:11,720
if you get attacked,
if you get shot because they weren't 

1552
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,910
there to protect you,
you cannot do that because that is,

1553
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:16,800
that's not their job.
So to me,

1554
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,860
I'm fine with that.
I got no problem with that.

1555
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,680
I don't expect it.
So if that's the case,

1556
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:28,580
don't restrict me from my ability to 
take care of myself and my family and 

1557
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:33,710
you know,
don't restrict me from having the tools 

1558
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:36,360
to do that and be that whatever that 
tool could be.

1559
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,930
Right.
The onLy issue is only in people who are

1560
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,540
psychotic,
who are criminals,

1561
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,700
who are either.
That's the only issue.

1562
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,520
So yes,
she was.

1563
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,670
And,
and you,

1564
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,660
you touch an issue.
That's a big thing with me is criminals.

1565
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,730
Okay.
Perfect example.

1566
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:57,170
Most of these shootings that have taken 
place have taken place.

1567
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,200
Almost all of them.
Even if the gun was bought legally,

1568
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:06,020
you know the guns were banned in that 
theater in Colorado,

1569
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,370
you know,
the military,

1570
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:11,120
the shooting that just took place at the
navy gun free zone.

1571
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:15,020
You know,
I'm new town at school,

1572
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,340
you know,
I mean,

1573
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:21,600
and in Nevada,
if you're a parent driving to pick up 

1574
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,060
your son or daughter,
if you just pick them up in the school,

1575
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:28,061
as soon as you enter that school yard,
if even if you're a licensed ccw 

1576
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:29,330
carrier,
you've jumped through every hoop.

1577
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:32,660
The stAte says you have to jump through 
a background check,

1578
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:37,690
a training course,
an actual proficiency tests where you 

1579
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:39,530
have to shoot your gun for score if you 
do all those actions,

1580
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:43,370
but yet you drive onto the school 
grounds to pick up your child.

1581
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:48,370
You never get out of your car.
if you have the gun on you or in your 

1582
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:48,370
car,
you're a criminal.

1583
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:51,830
You cannot bring a gun onto that school 
premises.

1584
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:53,720
You can't even have it in your car when 
you pick up your kid.

1585
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,720
So now to me,
if I'm a parent,

1586
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:58,520
I'm not a parent,
I don't have kids,

1587
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:03,550
but if I did,
I'm going to be a criminal because of 

1588
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:06,500
some asshole starts to shoot up a school
or somewhere,

1589
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:08,370
anything like that,
you know,

1590
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,710
I at least I'm not the guy sitting here 
saying a gun's going to solve everything

1591
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,390
because chances are it's probably not,
but it's an option you have.

1592
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,460
If you don't have it,
you don't have the option.

1593
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,170
You know whAt you are,
you're a sheep.

1594
01:18:21,171 --> 01:18:26,171
Just hoping you don't get shot.
You know if you have an option to fight 

1595
01:18:26,171 --> 01:18:30,251
back.
But if the state says you do not have 

1596
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:32,420
that option,
you must sit there and take.

1597
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,470
You must be a victim.
That's where I have a problem.

1598
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,620
The problem is the reality of the world 
that we live in.

1599
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:44,830
The problem is not the utopian 
possibilities of everybody being 

1600
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:46,640
completely gun free.
That's the real problem with the idea of

1601
01:18:46,641 --> 01:18:48,190
gun control.
Is that like,

1602
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:50,840
who's going to control who?
The people that abide by our laws.

1603
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:55,841
Do you really think that there's enough 
people out there to go out there and 

1604
01:18:55,841 --> 01:18:56,190
find the fucking guns that are in 
people's homes and.

1605
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:56,910
Well,
it,

1606
01:18:56,911 --> 01:18:57,880
it's,
it's number one.

1607
01:18:57,881 --> 01:19:02,881
It's completely impossible.
If you pass the law tomorrow and said 

1608
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:07,780
guns are illegal,
you couldn't build prisons fast enough.

1609
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:13,000
It just makes criminals out of regular 
people and it's to me,

1610
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,180
I just,
I'm of the opinion that,

1611
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:22,230
you know,
you can't stop a guy from being an 

1612
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:22,230
asshole.
Well,

1613
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:25,870
it's not even just an asshole.
It's like a rabid dog,

1614
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:30,990
you know?
I mean if something like this shit is 

1615
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:35,161
gonna happen man.
And I think one of the two things I 

1616
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:36,790
think the drugs have a part to do with 
it bigger than people give credit for.

1617
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:40,060
I really believe that.
And the other thing is I think the media

1618
01:19:40,061 --> 01:19:45,061
feeds it because they give these 
assholes instant celebrity and you see 

1619
01:19:45,971 --> 01:19:50,050
this and I think these breach.
Perfect example man.

1620
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:53,680
Chris dorner were you and la when this 
asshole was running around?

1621
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:55,870
Yeah,
he wrote a goddamn.

1622
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:59,830
You know,
I knew that dude freaky shit ever.

1623
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:01,330
Yeah,
I mean it was.

1624
01:20:01,331 --> 01:20:06,331
I mean,
I wouldn't like my buddy for folks who 

1625
01:20:06,331 --> 01:20:06,331
don't know,
he,

1626
01:20:06,331 --> 01:20:06,331
he,
uh,

1627
01:20:06,331 --> 01:20:06,331
I killed

1628
01:20:06,331 --> 01:20:07,980
the cop's kid and her boyfriend,

1629
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,650
her boyfriend and killed a bunch of 
cops,

1630
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:15,000
like pulled up to the red lights and 
shot up to two different incidents.

1631
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:20,001
He shot up cops,
I think he might've killed one cop and 

1632
01:20:20,001 --> 01:20:22,520
he was a former police officer.
He was fired and where lapd guy decided 

1633
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,430
he was going on in fucking rap and a but
on a,

1634
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,780
on a rampage rather.
But he was,

1635
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:31,830
he was a navy guy as well.
But this dude,

1636
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:34,530
I had met him actually in a gun store in
vegas.

1637
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:39,830
He used to hang out or not hanging,
I don't know if you'd call it hanging 

1638
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:42,411
out or whatever,
but he was a where I bought a lot of 

1639
01:20:42,411 --> 01:20:43,590
stuff in las vegas.
Uh,

1640
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,860
he would,
he bought shit from there as well.

1641
01:20:46,861 --> 01:20:51,861
Actually,
some of the shit that he used in his 

1642
01:20:51,861 --> 01:20:51,861
little rampage.
But,

1643
01:20:51,861 --> 01:20:53,820
uh,
when I saw him on the news,

1644
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:54,570
I was like,
god damn,

1645
01:20:54,571 --> 01:20:55,980
that dude looks familiar,
man.

1646
01:20:56,310 --> 01:21:00,330
Because when I saw him in vegas,
I always assumed he was military because

1647
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:05,331
they get a lot of military guys in there
because nellis and some of the other 

1648
01:21:05,331 --> 01:21:08,661
basis that around vegas,
a lot of military guys come in and do 

1649
01:21:08,661 --> 01:21:08,661
shit.
But uh,

1650
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:09,840
I was like,
man,

1651
01:21:09,841 --> 01:21:14,841
that guy looks familiar and sure enough,
my friend who was a manager at that 

1652
01:21:14,841 --> 01:21:14,841
store called me up and he was like,
dude,

1653
01:21:14,841 --> 01:21:16,860
that's fucking chris.
I sold him that shit.

1654
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:23,360
But here's the thing.
He went through all the legal 

1655
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:23,400
requirements.
Yeah.

1656
01:21:23,401 --> 01:21:27,090
And not only did he go through the legal
requirement of just a background check,

1657
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:32,420
he went through the shit I told you 
about what you have to pay out $200 tax 

1658
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,270
stamp.
But here's the other trick right now,

1659
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:35,820
the backlog on that is six to nine 
months long.

1660
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:39,120
So to buy a short barreled rifle or a 
suppressor,

1661
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:42,090
so you can go in,
you pay for this shit,

1662
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:47,810
you pay your $200 to the government,
and then you wait six months and it 

1663
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:49,020
takes them that long to do the 
paperwork.

1664
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:54,730
And then they send the stamp back.
It's a tax stamp and they send it back 

1665
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:57,900
and then you can have whatever the hell 
it is that you paid for it,

1666
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,150
but this guy did that so he can't get,
you know,

1667
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:08,780
this crazy bastard went through the most
strenuous process the federal government

1668
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:15,080
comes up with.
It's the process they have for selling 

1669
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,170
fully automatic weapons.
He went through that and he passed at 

1670
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:22,221
all and there was no way.
There was nothing in this guy's past 

1671
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:25,290
that would have thrown up a red flag for
anything.

1672
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:30,860
I mean,
he had security clearances through the 

1673
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:30,860
military.
He was a goddamn lapd cop,

1674
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:34,350
but he was fired from the lapd for 
excessive violence.

1675
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:37,020
right now,
from what I understand,

1676
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:41,040
he was fired because it was,
if I remember right,

1677
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,890
and I'm sure people,
I mean look it up,

1678
01:22:43,891 --> 01:22:48,891
but he was fired because his training 
officer basically said he wasn't 

1679
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:54,411
suitable,
is what I understood was that he 

1680
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:54,411
basically.

1681
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:56,070
Was it false complaint?
That's what it was.

1682
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:59,370
He went to his bosses and said,
uh,

1683
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:03,660
his partner had used a unnecessary force
or whatever.

1684
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:04,530
Oh,
that's right.

1685
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:09,590
That's right.
He's done necessary force and then he 

1686
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:11,911
ratted somebody out,
he ratted out and then the department 

1687
01:23:11,911 --> 01:23:11,911
fired him because they said he was 
lying,

1688
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,610
but it turns out he wasn't like,
whoa,

1689
01:23:15,611 --> 01:23:18,670
that's so crazy.
They took her a regular,

1690
01:23:18,671 --> 01:23:23,530
like super cop turned him into a killer 
with one little case like that.

1691
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:28,531
But that was what was kind of funny was 
the media was playing this guy up as 

1692
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,700
some kind of super trained,
you know,

1693
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:36,710
he was john rambo.
But if you look at the shit he did and 

1694
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,710
I,
you know,

1695
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:41,280
I'm fortunate through shooting and some 
other things that I've done,

1696
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:46,710
um,
to know and have some friends and the 

1697
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:48,120
community of guys soft guys and,
and things like that.

1698
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:52,160
soft guys.
Sof is an acronym for special operations

1699
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:57,161
forces.
That's kind of as the acronym that 99 

1700
01:23:57,161 --> 01:23:57,161
point nine,
nine,

1701
01:23:57,161 --> 01:23:59,210
nine percent of the people don't know 
soft is an acronym.

1702
01:23:59,211 --> 01:24:04,211
It stands for special operations forces 
and that's kind of an umbrella acronym 

1703
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:07,510
for um,
know rangers,

1704
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:09,340
special forces,
seals,

1705
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,290
things like that.
Um,

1706
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:16,060
and each one of those has their own 
terms.

1707
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:20,170
Like sf is special for a lot of times 
people will come.

1708
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:23,980
The media is terrible for this.
They'll say special forces and they mean

1709
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:28,981
special operations forces like special 
operations forces can be a seal team.

1710
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:34,830
Special forces is an army specific unit.
It's actually a branch service.

1711
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:40,120
But what I was getting back to as I was 
talking,

1712
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:45,210
I know I'm fortunate to know some of 
these guys and they were all kind of 

1713
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:46,090
laughing that,
you know,

1714
01:24:46,091 --> 01:24:51,091
if this guy was really trained,
the lapd would be fucked because the 

1715
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:53,410
shit that he did do was bad.

1716
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:59,010
But the way he got caught,
the thIngs he was doing is not the shit 

1717
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:00,010
of train guy does.
I mean,

1718
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:03,880
and,
and he could have done a lot more damage

1719
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,480
to.
I mean look at the dc snipers.

1720
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,210
Remember that case malveaux,
you know,

1721
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,270
elbow and that,
that kid,

1722
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:18,750
and I mean they shut down dc and it was 
two guys in one rifle and you know,

1723
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:23,070
if this guy was literally,
you know,

1724
01:25:23,071 --> 01:25:28,071
if he was the john rambo,
the media was trying to play him up as 

1725
01:25:28,071 --> 01:25:28,071
we've been a hell a lot higher body 
count.

1726
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:32,510
He was just just a fucking whack job.
It was a wack job to decide to go to the

1727
01:25:32,511 --> 01:25:37,511
mountains.
What the fuck ever gets out of the 

1728
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:39,641
mountains?
Whoever goes to the mountains trying to 

1729
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:39,641
flee from the law.
That's the worst place you can go.

1730
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,090
You want to go to the valley sun?

1731
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,220
You want to go to the place where he can
move around.

1732
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:48,400
You don't want to go to the one place 
where there's a peak and then you can't 

1733
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,010
go any higher.
You got up there and he fucked his truck

1734
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:49,730
up.
Yeah.

1735
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,970
And it was just hadley fuckers truck up 
to the axle,

1736
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:56,870
I guess was trying to get somewhere.
I just read.

1737
01:25:56,871 --> 01:25:59,840
I didn't go any farther than they lit 
his truck on fire.

1738
01:25:59,841 --> 01:26:02,940
Right.
And left his weapons and shit in,

1739
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:06,620
in the truck.
And then the crazy part though was.

1740
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:09,020
That's great.
Keep it out in a cabin.

1741
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:11,960
That was like literally right across the
street from the command post.

1742
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,730
That's good moment.
That.

1743
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:15,680
So they were searching all around him

1744
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:20,930
and he was in the cabin almost right 
across the street from the combat area 

1745
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:21,070
is very unusual.
You ever been up to big bear?

1746
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,630
No.
It's a very unusual.

1747
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:25,520
A lot of fighters go up there.
They do their attempts.

1748
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,580
Yeah.
It's really good for conditioning,

1749
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,310
but it's a strange place.
That's nice.

1750
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,770
Nice folks.
But that's weird.

1751
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:35,210
That whole.
Going back to kind of what I was talking

1752
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:40,211
about with my idea of the government not
having a responsibility to protect the 

1753
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:43,730
individual.
If you look at the boston bombing,

1754
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:47,450
you know,
these two guys with the boston bombing,

1755
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:51,410
they shut down a whole fucking major us 
city.

1756
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:55,580
I mean they were canceling like major 
sports games and shit that night.

1757
01:26:56,180 --> 01:27:01,180
And to me,
instead of having this mentality of 

1758
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:05,980
everybody go inside shelter in place,
you know,

1759
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:11,020
cower and then we're going to send in 
the fucking cops in their armored 

1760
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:14,510
personnel carriers.
And I mean it looked like Iraq.

1761
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:18,530
If you look at some of the photos that 
were taken during that time period,

1762
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:24,190
it looks like Iraq.
I mean these guys are wearing fucking 

1763
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:26,590
body armor and multicam and enforce on 
the streets of a us city and they're 

1764
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:31,490
looking for two assholes with a fucking 
pressure cooker bomb.

1765
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:34,310
And they shut down the whole city and 
they were telling people,

1766
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:36,680
don't come out of your house.
Be scared,

1767
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,180
you know,
to me,

1768
01:27:38,181 --> 01:27:39,800
wouldn't it be better to say,
you know what,

1769
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:43,160
if you see this fucking asshole,
call us.

1770
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,870
Yeah,
but you call us means shoot him.

1771
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:49,310
And I thought it was him officer,
but hey,

1772
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:54,270
no one's going to get better that than 
than coward unless it's your kid.

1773
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:59,660
Hey,
better that I don't know about better 

1774
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:02,280
that I agree with you to a certain 
extent and I agree with you with your 

1775
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:06,001
ability to be protected,
you don't think that it can't go the 

1776
01:28:06,001 --> 01:28:06,060
other way.
It certainly can.

1777
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:11,450
You know what?
If your kid happens to be brown and it 

1778
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:13,821
looked like that dude in a hoodie and 
he's out walking when they told 

1779
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:13,821
everybody,
be inside and be scared.

1780
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:18,650
well,
as if everything that we've said from 

1781
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:18,650
the beginning to the end,
it's.

1782
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:21,690
There's no gray area,
there's no black and white and any of 

1783
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,700
these things.
The real problem is human behavior.

1784
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:28,730
that's the.
What it boils down to is it's not 

1785
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:28,950
weapons and tools and equipments,
human behavior,

1786
01:28:28,951 --> 01:28:30,570
because every fucking hardware store has
an ax.

1787
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,430
Sure.
How many excavators you hear about every

1788
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:34,740
year.
Anybody can fuck you up with an ax.

1789
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:40,100
You know,
guy could walk into a grocery store and 

1790
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:40,100
how many people could have killed with 
the ax?

1791
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,690
Free stop them.
Probably quite a few did,

1792
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,620
and I wrote this on twitter and I'll say
to you,

1793
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:48,660
your quote was perfect.
We have a mental health problem.

1794
01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:51,060
This guys is a gun problem.
Yeah,

1795
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:56,320
and a security problem disguised as a 
tyranny problem or a tyranny problem 

1796
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,110
disguised as a security problem.
I fucked up my own quote.

1797
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,490
That's what.
That was a great quote.

1798
01:28:59,491 --> 01:29:01,170
I remember when you wrote that.
Well,

1799
01:29:01,171 --> 01:29:02,580
it's true.
It's a mental health problem.

1800
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:05,280
There's no doubt about it because.
Because I have guns in,

1801
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:10,340
almost all of my friends have guns.
I don't understand the idea that it's a 

1802
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:12,270
gun issue.
It's not a gun issue.

1803
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,010
Guns are our tools.

1804
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,650
It's the issue of implementing those 
tools in a horrible,

1805
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:21,651
horrific way.
Same thing you can do with your car if 

1806
01:29:21,651 --> 01:29:21,651
you're so inclined.
Anybody can do.

1807
01:29:21,651 --> 01:29:22,650
There was an old man that,
uh,

1808
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:23,670
he just,
you know,

1809
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:27,120
freaked out or whatever and just ran 
over a bunch of people in santa monica a

1810
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:28,890
couple of years ago.
It was horrific,

1811
01:29:28,891 --> 01:29:31,950
horrific story,
but any crazy person could do that too,

1812
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,810
you know,
just like they could shoot you.

1813
01:29:33,811 --> 01:29:36,420
They could kill just as many people in 
the car much quicker,

1814
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:39,990
but just plowing into a crowd.
It's so easy to do.

1815
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:40,950
They could possibly.

1816
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:46,180
How much damage could you do with a two 
liter bottle of gasoline in a movie 

1817
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:46,180
theater?
Oh,

1818
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:46,930
jesus.
Yeah.

1819
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,650
I mean,
yOu know,

1820
01:29:47,651 --> 01:29:51,820
if your intent is to do harm,
there's a lot of weapons and hurt people

1821
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:56,850
then that's it.
But my whole thing goes back to the 

1822
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,820
mindset that,
you know,

1823
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:03,540
if somebody doesn't want to take on the 
responsibility or,

1824
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:09,600
and it got nothing to do with guns,
it's a mindset of being able to take 

1825
01:30:10,421 --> 01:30:13,450
responsibility for your own safety.
You know?

1826
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:17,650
And if somebody doesn't want to do that,
they want to delegate that to the state,

1827
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:19,870
that's fine.
I don't have a problem with that,

1828
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:25,500
but telling me that I have to do that is
where I have a big giant problem.

1829
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:29,840
I totally understand what you're saying,
but I think there's the reality of human

1830
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:34,841
beings.
It requires a certain amount of 

1831
01:30:34,841 --> 01:30:35,120
filtering to make sure that shitheads 
it's less frequent.

1832
01:30:35,121 --> 01:30:37,370
You're going to get a few that get 
through no matter what you do,

1833
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:42,500
but I think that it's not a bad thing to
just be just a little bit diligent about

1834
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:45,400
who you fucking allowed to have guns and
that's fine because

1835
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:50,660
I mean if it stopped right now today,
if you looked at the gun laws on the 

1836
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:52,280
books and that's the other thing,

1837
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:55,840
you mean if it didn't get any more 
restrictive and if it stopped.

1838
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:58,450
all you gun guys are all like 
suppression.

1839
01:30:58,451 --> 01:31:00,520
If it stops the day fucking crazy.

1840
01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:03,460
Well,
here's why is because the anti gunners,

1841
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:08,490
wherever you want to call them,
they always talk about we need to 

1842
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:08,490
compromise.
We should.

1843
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:10,990
We should come to a compromise,
but here's the compromise.

1844
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:13,720
They never give anything up.
I mean,

1845
01:31:13,721 --> 01:31:17,500
it's always one more thing they're 
taking away and this,

1846
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:22,240
this has been going on since the 
thirties and depending on.

1847
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:25,540
I'm not a guy,
I mean on principle,

1848
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:27,460
in theory,
I'm kind of,

1849
01:31:27,461 --> 01:31:30,790
I am called libertarian wherever the 
hell you want to call it,

1850
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:36,010
but I am of the mind that pretty much 
anything goes.

1851
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,330
I mean it should go and if you fuck up,
you deserve to get hammered.

1852
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,730
Whether that's drugs,
guns,

1853
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:43,520
whatever,
or

1854
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:44,720
prostitution.
AnYthing.

1855
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:46,310
Exactly.
Exactly.

1856
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:49,970
Who's to say a woman can't sell her ass 
if she wants to.

1857
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,560
Yeah,
I mean as her body,

1858
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,240
especially if she can actually get money
for it.

1859
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:55,760
Exactly.
And so why can't you give him?

1860
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,280
He can give massages.
Why isn't that illegal?

1861
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:00,210
It's just not eligible.

1862
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:02,890
You need a massage.
Massage is a,

1863
01:32:02,891 --> 01:32:04,480
you know,
just as intimate.

1864
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:09,540
Oftentimes the socket,
your deck or a humming blow job through 

1865
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:12,271
the pants.
Yeah.

1866
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:19,021
I'm a look.
You and I are on the same page with 

1867
01:32:19,021 --> 01:32:22,231
almost everything.
You're a little more gun that he than 

1868
01:32:22,231 --> 01:32:22,231
me,
but that's all right.

1869
01:32:22,231 --> 01:32:22,240
I'm pretty good now.
I understand it.

1870
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:23,760
I see where you're coming from.
You know,

1871
01:32:23,761 --> 01:32:28,761
you're coming from the fact that they 
worked for you and you don't want 

1872
01:32:28,761 --> 01:32:28,761
anybody fucking with your life.
And that's a,

1873
01:32:28,761 --> 01:32:31,360
that's a rational,
almost an american value.

1874
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,420
The idea of leave me the fuck alone.
Right?

1875
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:35,290
And that's sort of slipping away

1876
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:38,130
and I will stand up and you know,
I will,

1877
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,580
I will,
I will be more than happy to,

1878
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,830
to defend the guys.
I'll,

1879
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:43,480
I'll stand up and say,
you know what?

1880
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:49,500
I respect and defend the right for 
someone to say I don't agree with what 

1881
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:52,210
I'm saying or that I'm an asshole.
No problem.

1882
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:53,920
Okay,
you have the right to say that.

1883
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:59,340
But where it's to me that it stops is 
that when people force me to delegate my

1884
01:33:03,131 --> 01:33:08,131
ability to protect myself and the state 
will not take up that slack.

1885
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:13,330
They can not only see they can't and 
they won't and they shouldn't.

1886
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:16,900
But people saying to me,
you know,

1887
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:22,530
you don't have,
we are going to take away your ability 

1888
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:26,190
to protect yourself in the,
in the name of the off chance that you 

1889
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:32,350
know this may prevent something and 
everyone knows that at won't.

1890
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:37,351
Because you know why criminals don't 
follow the fucking dirt crazy.

1891
01:33:38,561 --> 01:33:38,890
Right?

1892
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:44,210
Well,
laws in themselves in and of themselves 

1893
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:44,210
are very strange.
uh,

1894
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:48,740
in that.
Is that a helicopter just we've been 

1895
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:49,500
talking to which real shit I told you 
bro.

1896
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:52,470
The man done got scared.
Turn off.

1897
01:33:52,471 --> 01:33:57,330
You're in his helicopter.
Alex jones in here right now.

1898
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:59,790
He'd rattle off some statistics.
You have to be amazed.

1899
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:02,760
You'd be amazed at how many people are 
being watched by black helicopters.

1900
01:34:02,761 --> 01:34:06,330
HAve no idea,
dude.

1901
01:34:06,331 --> 01:34:06,860
That shit

1902
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,040
when the donor thing was going on.
Yeah.

1903
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:11,590
I don't follow Alex Jones at all.
But you follow it.

1904
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:16,591
Then somehow through there and in the 
way I started following him kind of 

1905
01:34:16,591 --> 01:34:20,490
paying attention was because of that 
fucking correspondent he had at the 

1906
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:24,121
press,
a press conferences that the cops were 

1907
01:34:24,121 --> 01:34:24,121
doing.
Did you see that?

1908
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:26,050
No,
I was fucking hilarious.

1909
01:34:26,051 --> 01:34:30,430
These cops are standing up and you know,
you could tell the whole fucking city of

1910
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:32,980
la was scared to death and not only 
that,

1911
01:34:32,981 --> 01:34:37,981
but the cops are lightened up mexican 
women in a white truck for no fucking 

1912
01:34:37,981 --> 01:34:39,610
because it might look like what he was 
driving.

1913
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:44,780
That's fun.
So I mean the whole fucking city 

1914
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:44,780
slipping out,
going trigger happy with the cops.

1915
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:49,770
But this cops given a fucking rundown of
trying to be very precise and all this 

1916
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:54,571
shit and some correspondence from info 
wars or whatever stands up and asks the 

1917
01:34:54,571 --> 01:34:56,110
most asinine.
I can't even remember.

1918
01:34:56,111 --> 01:34:56,860
So stupid.
It's like,

1919
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,010
you know,
how do you

1920
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,400
say that chris dorner was a plant and 
there's all this other bullshit and it.

1921
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,650
Or was it the boston bombings?
It was the boston bombings.

1922
01:35:03,651 --> 01:35:08,651
It wasn't dorner.
It was boston bombing was boston 

1923
01:35:08,651 --> 01:35:08,651
bombings.
I'm sorry,

1924
01:35:08,651 --> 01:35:09,470
I got them confused.
Confused the fuck out of me.

1925
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,660
It was the boston bombings.
It was a boss.

1926
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:14,090
But you remember what I'm talking about 
with the press conference.

1927
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,120
That guy standing up saying that they 
were.

1928
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:21,160
That's what it was saying.
They were plants saying that it was a 

1929
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:21,350
the guys in the windbreakers or 
whatever.

1930
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:26,560
Yeah,
there was a lot of weirdness when it 

1931
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:26,560
came to those boston bombings.
That was very weird.

1932
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:31,421
There were so many people that were 
crying out that it was a false flag and 

1933
01:35:31,421 --> 01:35:35,441
there was so many,
so much disinformation to what is 

1934
01:35:35,441 --> 01:35:35,441
information,
what not.

1935
01:35:35,441 --> 01:35:40,000
I'm not a conspiracy guy either,
but I was just aware of how much of it 

1936
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,621
was being perpetrated online and how 
many people were getting the timeline 

1937
01:35:44,621 --> 01:35:48,101
wrong,
so they show him these guys who were 

1938
01:35:48,101 --> 01:35:49,661
responding and saying that these guys 
were waiting before it ever happened 

1939
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:49,661
like that.

1940
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:54,490
They already knew about it.
Like there's so much incorrect 

1941
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:54,490
information.
It's,

1942
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:56,390
it's weird when that kind of shit 
happens and you know,

1943
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:59,600
that's somethinG that I really learned a
lot about when I did this.

1944
01:35:59,601 --> 01:36:02,290
A scifi show that joe rogan questions.
Everything's right.

1945
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:02,680
Yeah,
yeah,

1946
01:36:02,681 --> 01:36:05,330
yeah.
I learned a lot about the mind of people

1947
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:09,380
who just automatically think that things
are not on the up and up.

1948
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:14,700
Right.
And the real issue is that sometimes 

1949
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:15,350
things aren't on the up and up.
That's a fact,

1950
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:18,140
the fact,
but I think more often than not,

1951
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:23,590
people look for it.
It's not so much it's on the up and up 

1952
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:26,201
because there's a conspiracy.
It's on the up and up because people 

1953
01:36:26,201 --> 01:36:26,810
don't know what the fuck's going on and 
they make shit up to fill the space.

1954
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,210
There's definitely that.
There's definitely some of that,

1955
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:34,660
but then there's also real instances 
throughout history were there's been 

1956
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:35,040
perpetrated.

1957
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:38,120
It becomes a real problem because you 
try to figure out what's what.

1958
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:43,190
And there's a lot of people that get 
involved in these sorts of endeavors.

1959
01:36:43,191 --> 01:36:44,810
trying to figure out what's real and 
what's not.

1960
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:48,380
That will have what I call a soft 
intellect.

1961
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:50,540
Okay.
You know the ability,

1962
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:55,541
but by soft I don't mean they're stupid,
but I mean if someone can like fairly 

1963
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:59,150
easily shove a new idea and them and 
guide them down the path,

1964
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:01,940
they want to go shove a hand up their 
ass and have,

1965
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:06,980
you know,
confused them to the point where they 

1966
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:06,980
believe it.
Some people,

1967
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:11,350
they have a need in them to believe 
fantastical shit that no one else has 

1968
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:13,190
discovered.
There's a weird,

1969
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:18,220
almost like a desire,
it's almost like the same thing that 

1970
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:21,730
it's almost like a bygone thing that's 
like left in our dna from when we had to

1971
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:24,110
discover a new place that had like 
better food.

1972
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:28,460
We found a new hunting trail to find 
these new uncovered things.

1973
01:37:28,461 --> 01:37:31,610
It's almost like an imperative and the 
the human psyche,

1974
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:36,350
so people look for fucking stupid shit.
They look for the to be the one guy,

1975
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:38,180
the trail blazer,
that breaker,

1976
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:40,850
and it doesn't mean that people don't 
conspire,

1977
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:44,300
but it also means that that too.
There's that too.

1978
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:49,460
Yeah,
we got to be aware of that too because 

1979
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,510
if you're not aware of that too,
if you deny that to you really do a huge

1980
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:55,511
disservice to the actual information 
that you're capable of pulling out when 

1981
01:37:55,511 --> 01:37:55,540
you look at things subjectively.
Right?

1982
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,130
But there's

1983
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,400
a lot of people that can't do that.
They get involved in this 10,

1984
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:02,070
11,000
step game.

1985
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:05,550
They want to go three or four steps in 
and be rigid with their information.

1986
01:38:05,551 --> 01:38:10,551
They Want to stop right here.
This is clearly a conspiracy that guys 

1987
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:12,030
were in the wrong backpack towards his 
left.

1988
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,490
This photo shows us towards right?
And it's,

1989
01:38:14,491 --> 01:38:17,520
I'm doing this show.
I've realized that that's an actual,

1990
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:22,580
it's like a psychological groove.
It's like these people establish it in 

1991
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:26,481
their minds that everything is 
everything's a conspiracy and it's not 

1992
01:38:26,481 --> 01:38:28,590
to say that some things aren't.
Many things are,

1993
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:33,770
so they have some confirmation.
They get some confirmation out of 

1994
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:33,770
history,
gulf of tonkin,

1995
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:36,060
all these different incidents,
instances,

1996
01:38:36,061 --> 01:38:36,270
the,
uh,

1997
01:38:36,271 --> 01:38:38,900
the bush cheney idea of before they left
office.

1998
01:38:38,901 --> 01:38:43,100
So a false flag about Iran was being 
bandied about the,

1999
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:48,250
the,
the northwoods document where they 

2000
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:50,450
wanted to blow up the fucking drone 
airliner and blame it on Cuba and start 

2001
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:50,450
war with Cuba.

2002
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:55,550
All that shit's real.
So the problem is it gets real cloudy 

2003
01:38:55,550 --> 01:39:00,081
out there if you're not thinking good.
so if you got any sort of an instance 

2004
01:39:00,081 --> 01:39:04,040
that happens in the news,
whether it's that bombing or this 

2005
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:05,130
bombing or this attack or that attack or
this,

2006
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:10,580
there's always going to be a lot of 
horseshit flying around because anyone 

2007
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:12,630
can contribute to the soup of ideas.
Sure,

2008
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:15,240
anybody could throw some dickhead comes 
along and goes,

2009
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:20,480
oh,
nunes and fucking a giant bucket of 

2010
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:20,540
onions and your soup and your like 
dickhead.

2011
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:25,580
There was plenty of onions.
Now it's fucking onion soup with a 

2012
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:25,870
little bit of chicken.
That's the,

2013
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:30,890
the.
That's the real issue with the 

2014
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:32,960
information that we received today is 
that there's a gigantic soup of people 

2015
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:37,230
and the amount of actual real 
journalists,

2016
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:42,530
the real,
the original real journalists have been 

2017
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:42,530
replaced by these corporate puppets.

2018
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:47,510
And then there's real quote unquote 
print journalists who are terrified of 

2019
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:47,670
the new media.
Right.

2020
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:50,370
And they'll,
they'll do diffuse vice.com

2021
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:51,630
or have,
you know,

2022
01:39:51,631 --> 01:39:52,260
they'll,
they'll,

2023
01:39:52,261 --> 01:39:54,960
they'll try to take down all the new 
media and,

2024
01:39:54,961 --> 01:39:59,961
and you know,
and make it seem as if these people are 

2025
01:39:59,961 --> 01:40:04,280
cretins and these people don't deserve 
to be representative of the news and the

2026
01:40:04,831 --> 01:40:08,250
old gray lady is the way to go the New 
York times as the gold standard,

2027
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:12,720
but it's not the gold standard there.
The reality has been deposed false shit.

2028
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:15,060
They get caught all the time and by the 
way,

2029
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:16,530
you're just human.
Okay.

2030
01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:18,690
There is no New York times anymore.
How about this?

2031
01:40:18,691 --> 01:40:22,260
How about you or not important about the
fucking information is important and the

2032
01:40:22,261 --> 01:40:25,110
vehicle for the for distributing the 
information they want.

2033
01:40:25,111 --> 01:40:28,860
So many accolades is a current.
Any vehicle that wants so much,

2034
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:31,080
so much love,
so much money.

2035
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:35,310
Giant corporation backed up behind 
delivering information.

2036
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:40,610
That's it.
That's nonsense for you to have an ego 

2037
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:42,660
about past delivering of information,
things that you should have done because

2038
01:40:42,661 --> 01:40:45,600
that's your fucking job.
Your job is to deliver information.

2039
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:49,890
You're a goddamn newspaper,
so if you get all uppity and uptight and

2040
01:40:49,891 --> 01:40:54,891
be afraid of the internet when your 
whole fucking thing has been on 

2041
01:40:54,891 --> 01:40:56,170
reporting shit,
that actually happens.

2042
01:40:56,171 --> 01:40:56,710
That's it.

2043
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,240
It's also about.
Goes back to the same thing.

2044
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:00,300
Control.
Yeah,

2045
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:05,380
because if some asshole on the internet 
can get on and build a following and and

2046
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:08,660
gain confidence,
you know what?

2047
01:41:08,661 --> 01:41:10,940
There is no fucking editor sitting over 
him saying,

2048
01:41:10,941 --> 01:41:15,941
you know what?
You might not want to say that because 

2049
01:41:15,941 --> 01:41:15,941
this might piss off my buddy who owns 
this company.

2050
01:41:15,941 --> 01:41:20,660
Yeah,
and that's not to slight the New York 

2051
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:20,660
times,
the wall street journal,

2052
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:25,131
the boston globe or any of the old 
newspapers in any way and not to 

2053
01:41:25,131 --> 01:41:27,510
diminish their accomplishments in the 
end to end to diminish the.

2054
01:41:27,511 --> 01:41:29,070
The,
the importance of them.

2055
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:34,250
I at least I've read the boston globe 
every fucking day when I was a kid 

2056
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:37,410
because I delivered it.
I delivered it from age shit.

2057
01:41:37,411 --> 01:41:42,411
I started like age 17 to 22.
I delivered the boston globe and at 

2058
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:44,850
occasionally the herald.
I read a newspaper every day.

2059
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,920
Newspapers are fucking huge.
There were really,

2060
01:41:46,921 --> 01:41:51,921
really important,
but you did a job just like feeding 

2061
01:41:51,921 --> 01:41:55,230
people was really fucking important back
then to everybody who fed people.

2062
01:41:55,380 --> 01:42:00,380
Those people deserve metals as well,
so the feeding people and providing 

2063
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:01,560
information or actually equally 
important,

2064
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:06,830
but the people who fed people didn't get
treated like kings and queens and 

2065
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:10,341
getting didn't get to fucking throw 
their arms in the air and and rant and 

2066
01:42:10,341 --> 01:42:12,300
rave when a new method of distributing 
nutrition was introduced.

2067
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:14,280
But it goes back to to,
you know,

2068
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:19,820
the people who did distribute that 
information were courted by those in 

2069
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:20,520
power.
Yeah.

2070
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:22,890
It goes back all the way.
It always has.

2071
01:42:23,010 --> 01:42:24,840
I mean,
as long as there's been a written word,

2072
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:30,380
but it goes and that's one thing that I 
think now it still fucked up with the 

2073
01:42:32,491 --> 01:42:35,520
new medias because how do you control 
everything?

2074
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:37,880
We can't control.
Everything can't control.

2075
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:39,450
What you can do is marginalize it.

2076
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,460
You shouldn't be able to control 
everything.

2077
01:42:41,461 --> 01:42:46,461
People have to realize that enough is 
enough and if you need more money than 

2078
01:42:46,461 --> 01:42:47,850
what you're making,
most likely you don't deserve it.

2079
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:51,050
That's a good point.
That's the reality of the situation.

2080
01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:54,210
If you need more money than than you are
currently making,

2081
01:42:54,211 --> 01:42:56,820
most likely you don't deserve it.
It's possible that you do,

2082
01:42:56,821 --> 01:43:01,821
and don't get me wrong.
What I mean by that is that there's a 

2083
01:43:01,821 --> 01:43:05,121
lot of people out there that want.
They want to figure out how to profit 

2084
01:43:05,251 --> 01:43:10,251
more.
They want to figure out how to make 

2085
01:43:10,251 --> 01:43:10,251
more.
They want to figure out how to.

2086
01:43:10,251 --> 01:43:11,580
But if you're really doing what you're 
supposed to do,

2087
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,550
I firmly believe that there's.
There's,

2088
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:16,920
there's,
there's rivers,

2089
01:43:16,921 --> 01:43:21,921
you're going to have to cross,
there's mountains you're going to have 

2090
01:43:21,921 --> 01:43:21,921
to climb,
you're going to have to figure out a way

2091
01:43:21,921 --> 01:43:26,421
around it,
and you might not be in a good place 

2092
01:43:26,421 --> 01:43:26,610
right now,
but if you're a person and you're smart,

2093
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:31,830
there's ways to navigate yourself around
almost every situation.

2094
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:34,110
As long as you getting nutrition and 
you're alive.

2095
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,960
If you're getting the nutrition,
you're alive and you've got an ability 

2096
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:40,410
to think for yourself,
you might be in a terrible situation.

2097
01:43:40,411 --> 01:43:45,411
I understand that,
but there may very well be a way out of 

2098
01:43:45,411 --> 01:43:46,440
that situation.
And if I took 10 guys,

2099
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:51,980
baby,
only four would be able to figure the 

2100
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,171
way out of that situation.
It doesn't mean that situation is 

2101
01:43:54,171 --> 01:43:57,100
unresolvable.
It means that you got to fucking figure 

2102
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:57,100
it out.
Bitch,

2103
01:43:57,100 --> 01:44:01,180
you got delta really shit.
Hand a cards and that happens to people 

2104
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:02,180
all the time,
but this is gross tendency for people to

2105
01:44:02,181 --> 01:44:03,450
just go,
oh good,

2106
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:06,890
shoot here,
new cards and you didn't.

2107
01:44:06,891 --> 01:44:10,220
So you don't understand where I come 
from and you have male privilege.

2108
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:15,420
I think that's what you just said.
I think that is 100 percent the case in 

2109
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:19,531
the United States at this point in time.
If you look at people that come here and

2110
01:44:20,531 --> 01:44:25,531
I was thinking of.
I was thinking about coming on this 

2111
01:44:25,531 --> 01:44:26,170
podcast and I was thinking about this 
the other day and you know,

2112
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:32,790
I drive.
That's one thing about I live in vegas 

2113
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:35,311
in the dichotomy of vegas has always 
really struck me as something that's 

2114
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:39,460
kind of fucked up and that you can go 
from the cosmopolitan hotel with people 

2115
01:44:39,911 --> 01:44:43,810
rolling up $150,000
cars and the most beautiful women in the

2116
01:44:43,811 --> 01:44:48,280
world with millions of dollars that they
can spend to drive 10 minutes.

2117
01:44:48,281 --> 01:44:53,281
And there was a home depot with a 
mexican standing outside of it that is 

2118
01:44:53,281 --> 01:44:56,680
willing to work at whatever job you want
to give him for $10 a day and busted his

2119
01:44:56,681 --> 01:45:00,370
ass and or guatemalan or I don't know if
that's a proper term,

2120
01:45:00,371 --> 01:45:01,270
but you know.

2121
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:04,540
And then we've got a guy who's come here
and willing to do nothing,

2122
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:07,780
and then you got people that are 
perfectly able to work,

2123
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:13,470
but they've been told,
and it's not even a lot of people's 

2124
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:14,320
fault because from the time they were 
raised up,

2125
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,840
it's not your fault that you don't have 
anything.

2126
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:20,830
It's you've been fucked over.
You know it.

2127
01:45:20,831 --> 01:45:21,920
It's,
you know,

2128
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:24,850
society has kept you down,
they've kept you on educated.

2129
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:27,160
It's not your fault,
you don't have anything,

2130
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:30,970
but yet you get people in.
And that's one of the beauties to me and

2131
01:45:30,971 --> 01:45:33,190
it's cliche,
it really is.

2132
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:35,830
But to me that's one of the beauties of 
this country.

2133
01:45:35,831 --> 01:45:38,860
And that's the thing.
This country to me is built on.

2134
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:43,300
And if you ask almost anyone from that 
has come here from somewhere else,

2135
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:49,020
they will tell you that that's why they 
came here is because this is one of the 

2136
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:53,290
few places in the world where you can 
take yourself from nothing to something.

2137
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:58,250
If you're willing to work and you want 
to bust your ass and,

2138
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:02,650
and understand and adapt to the 
circumstances you were in.

2139
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:08,220
There really is opportunity here.
And so when I hear people talk about 

2140
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:08,950
what you're saying,
you know that,

2141
01:46:08,951 --> 01:46:10,330
oh,
I got fucked over,

2142
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:11,680
I got no,
you know,

2143
01:46:11,681 --> 01:46:14,350
I mean,
I think we both were someone to say,

2144
01:46:14,351 --> 01:46:15,240
I mean,
I'm not.

2145
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:17,560
Nobody would consider me successful.
I,

2146
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:22,990
I'm successful in the fact that I get to
do what I like to do and I really enjoy 

2147
01:46:23,171 --> 01:46:24,880
that.
I mean to me,

2148
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,790
I make less money now than I did when I 
worked for ford.

2149
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:28,780
But you know,
what?

2150
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:31,540
I get up and I get to do whatever the 
fuck I want to do today.

2151
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:34,270
Yeah.
Mostly for folks who don't even know.

2152
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:37,680
We didn't even really introduce justin.
Justin runs the action report.com

2153
01:46:37,681 --> 01:46:42,681
is one of my favorite websites and they 
put on these big time high level pool 

2154
01:46:42,681 --> 01:46:43,840
matches were uh,
used to be.

2155
01:46:43,841 --> 01:46:46,270
guys would come with big backers and 
now,

2156
01:46:46,271 --> 01:46:51,271
uh,
because of the success of it and the 

2157
01:46:51,271 --> 01:46:51,271
fact it's been around for a long time,
now

2158
01:46:51,271 --> 01:46:51,271
they can actually have like,
um,

2159
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:55,830
have like a prize fund and get sponsors 
and all sorts of things.

2160
01:46:55,831 --> 01:46:56,340
And it's all

2161
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,070
online.
Like the very best players in the world,

2162
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:01,770
duke it out back and forth and yeah,
you,

2163
01:47:01,771 --> 01:47:03,900
you can do now because of this,
you know,

2164
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:07,080
because this is really a very popular 
thing in the world.

2165
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:12,081
The pool,
it's like the most important thing in 

2166
01:47:12,081 --> 01:47:12,081
the world.
The pool right now,

2167
01:47:12,081 --> 01:47:14,040
my opinion is no pool on tv these days 
and if it wasn't for the strong presence

2168
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:16,140
of the internet,
whether it's ace billiards.com

2169
01:47:16,141 --> 01:47:19,020
or whether it's your website,
there's not much keeping.

2170
01:47:19,021 --> 01:47:22,470
Like the community of pool players 
together pulls a weird thing.

2171
01:47:22,471 --> 01:47:27,471
Man.
People don't understand how fun it is 

2172
01:47:27,471 --> 01:47:28,530
for the people who play it.
For a guy like you were.

2173
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:30,270
I was one of those things

2174
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:32,970
to me,
if you're not a pool guy,

2175
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:38,030
like the stuff we do,
I'm probably wouldn't interest you 

2176
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:39,660
because our shit is designed for the 
fan.

2177
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:41,400
The guy who understands the game and 
stuff.

2178
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,440
But at the same time,

2179
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:47,320
to me,
paul is the world of pool.

2180
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:49,490
I mean it goes back to the movie,
the hustler,

2181
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,530
you know,
then you got the color of money,

2182
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:55,970
but it's a subculture that is almost 
uniquely american.

2183
01:47:56,540 --> 01:48:01,540
It really is,
and it's been transplanted to other 

2184
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:01,540
countries,
um,

2185
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:06,370
but the american and my website's name 
is the action report and it started out 

2186
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:12,430
as an idea to show the gambling side of 
the game because our idea was I'd been 

2187
01:48:13,971 --> 01:48:17,540
around pulling my whole life and I've 
always loved the gambling side of it and

2188
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:20,480
you know,
pool for the most part on espn.

2189
01:48:20,481 --> 01:48:25,481
they dress a guys up like golfers and 
they send them out there and one guy 

2190
01:48:25,481 --> 01:48:29,231
breaks and runs and the other guy breaks
and runs and they all look the same and 

2191
01:48:29,231 --> 01:48:30,680
nobody and it just didn't go anywhere.
But,

2192
01:48:31,490 --> 01:48:32,690
you know,
to me,

2193
01:48:32,691 --> 01:48:35,420
I enjoy the action side of the game and 
that was,

2194
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:40,280
and it wasn't because so much of the 
bedding or the guys,

2195
01:48:40,281 --> 01:48:41,930
you know,
talking up a game,

2196
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:47,590
but because to me it comes back to a 
quintessential american fucking idea of 

2197
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:55,900
two guys coming in,
putting their money up and the way you 

2198
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:58,700
keep track is by who gets more money at 
the end.

2199
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:00,200
I mean,
that's,

2200
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:01,670
you know,
you already doesn't count.

2201
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:03,960
Yeah.
It's all just in.

2202
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:09,090
The beautiful thing about pool is that 
that's actually the reason why it's 

2203
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:13,631
called pool in the first place,
like folks don't realize it was called 

2204
01:49:13,631 --> 01:49:15,710
pocket billiards,
pooling their money together.

2205
01:49:15,711 --> 01:49:19,080
The bet on the game was the whole reason
why it was like the,

2206
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:21,820
the chosen sport of the forbidden youth,
you know,

2207
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:25,850
the glorious results of a misspent youth
is all about how good you are at playing

2208
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:28,550
pool.
There's those areas during the,

2209
01:49:28,551 --> 01:49:29,590
you know,
max amberly,

2210
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:30,950
kind of an expert on the,
uh,

2211
01:49:30,951 --> 01:49:35,951
the bachelor lifestyle and max everly 
talks with great fondness of the 

2212
01:49:36,801 --> 01:49:40,850
bachelor lifestyle of the early 19 
hundreds in New York city and all across

2213
01:49:40,851 --> 01:49:45,851
the country really were men who are 
bachelors would go to pool halls and 

2214
01:49:45,851 --> 01:49:45,980
that's where they would live and hang 
out.

2215
01:49:45,981 --> 01:49:50,981
And those are the guys that did want 
settle down and have families and just 

2216
01:49:50,981 --> 01:49:51,040
join the american grind.
Right?

2217
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:52,290
and that,
to me,

2218
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:55,530
pool has always been.
It's dying,

2219
01:49:55,531 --> 01:49:58,740
now it's dead pretty much,
but for a lot of years,

2220
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,870
even through the war,
the thirties,

2221
01:50:00,871 --> 01:50:01,950
twenties,
thirties,

2222
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:03,360
uh,
after world war one,

2223
01:50:03,450 --> 01:50:05,370
even up and through the great 
depression.

2224
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:10,970
But there was that they called and pool,
it's called a road player or roadman.

2225
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:16,640
And that is a guy who goes from town to 
town playing,

2226
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:19,230
depending on.
Personally,

2227
01:50:19,231 --> 01:50:24,231
I hate the term pool hustler.
I fucking despise it because to me a 

2228
01:50:24,331 --> 01:50:26,640
pool hustler is a thief,
is a con man.

2229
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:29,270
He's a guy that goes in and,
you know,

2230
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:30,960
tries to,
you know,

2231
01:50:30,961 --> 01:50:33,450
he lays down and he tries to get some 
sucker,

2232
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:34,650
you know,
the gam.

2233
01:50:34,651 --> 01:50:36,360
That's always an interesting story.
You know,

2234
01:50:36,361 --> 01:50:38,520
the movie the hustler was pretty much 
based on that,

2235
01:50:38,990 --> 01:50:43,990
uh,
in pool they call it playing on the 

2236
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:45,450
lemon.
But to me what I like and the way most,

2237
01:50:45,451 --> 01:50:47,520
a lot of successful road guys,
I knew,

2238
01:50:48,150 --> 01:50:51,030
they didn't go in and try to play and 
say they play bad.

2239
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:56,420
They will go in and say,
I'll beat any asshole you got in here 

2240
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:57,540
for whatever you want to bet.
That's the truly american idea of it.

2241
01:50:57,780 --> 01:51:02,780
And it's,
it goes back to the gunfighter thing or 

2242
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:02,780
um,
oh god,

2243
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:05,580
what's the,
the japanese swordman sorta mri.

2244
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:06,350
Yes.
No,

2245
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:11,360
the uh,
the guy you got tattooed on your arm 

2246
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,820
that,
you know,

2247
01:51:11,821 --> 01:51:15,450
the thing that people come at him and 
test him.

2248
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:20,540
Yeah.
And to me that idea and that's kind of 

2249
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:24,681
what are our site and our events and 
what we do is kind of based on it was 

2250
01:51:24,681 --> 01:51:28,190
like who is the best,
how do you find out who the best?

2251
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:33,700
Well,
we didn't really even know until your 

2252
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:33,700
site came around because these racist to
100.

2253
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:34,840
We're so incredibly rare.
Yeah.

2254
01:51:34,970 --> 01:51:39,970
We were talking earlier before the show 
about the color of money match between 

2255
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:43,901
effort.
ray is earl strickland who would like 

2256
01:51:43,901 --> 01:51:45,020
the best american player and the best 
filipino paleo player for a lot of folks

2257
01:51:45,021 --> 01:51:50,021
who don't know anything about pool for 
the filipinos in the 19 fifties I guess 

2258
01:51:50,151 --> 01:51:52,730
when the United States navy,
the navy,

2259
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:53,990
big,
big navy base,

2260
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:59,020
they introduced a pool to the filipinos 
and they just fuck it and ran with that 

2261
01:51:59,301 --> 01:52:03,650
shit and now they produce some of the 
very best players in the world.

2262
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:04,910
It's kind of interesting

2263
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:10,230
in the Philippines is this,
I mean it's as big a deal is any major 

2264
01:52:10,230 --> 01:52:14,350
sport in the United States are shane.
There's a kid named shane van boning,

2265
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,770
who's in my opinion,
the best american player at this time.

2266
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,710
He's a friend of mine.
He plays in a lot of our matches,

2267
01:52:21,310 --> 01:52:26,310
but he was joking that the only place on
earth you can get in the cab and have 

2268
01:52:27,041 --> 01:52:29,170
the cab driver knew who he is in the 
Philippines.

2269
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:32,770
That's incredible.
That's funny.

2270
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:38,310
He,
I've talked about him on the podcast 

2271
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:38,310
several times.
Folks who haven't heard about it,

2272
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:39,610
he's,
he's deaf and when he plays pool,

2273
01:52:39,611 --> 01:52:42,790
he shuts his hearing aid off and it just
goes into the zone.

2274
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:46,220
And uh,
he also plays killer

2275
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:51,230
too.
He plays about as good as anybody who's 

2276
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:51,230
ever played.
He's,

2277
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:54,770
he has his moments where it's just 
stunning shit.

2278
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:59,910
And he had those moments gambling for 
big money on your podcast or your,

2279
01:52:59,911 --> 01:53:03,530
your broadcasts rather when these race 
to hundreds when you see him,

2280
01:53:03,531 --> 01:53:08,531
like get loose and just fire on dudes 
and hit them with you had I really tight

2281
01:53:08,961 --> 01:53:12,230
table for folks that don't know.
A standard table is five inches.

2282
01:53:12,231 --> 01:53:14,180
Like if you buy one right froM the 
store,

2283
01:53:14,181 --> 01:53:17,780
a lot of times are about five inches,
a cut tables about four inches.

2284
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,330
And you got five and four and a half.
Four and a half.

2285
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:21,910
But you guys were for.
Yeah,

2286
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:23,550
for you guys were tight for.
Yeah.

2287
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,640
And it was brutality and guys would 
panic every time.

2288
01:53:27,641 --> 01:53:32,641
I mean [inaudible] you're playing for a 
lot of money and there's not a lot of 

2289
01:53:32,641 --> 01:53:32,641
margin of error.

2290
01:53:32,641 --> 01:53:34,550
And you'd go to shoot into that four 
inch fucking hold on a diamond table,

2291
01:53:34,551 --> 01:53:38,990
which is really difficult because it has
an extra wide or extra deep shelf.

2292
01:53:38,991 --> 01:53:42,860
So a lot of balls that would fall on a 
brunswick don't fall on a diamond.

2293
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:44,420
Yep.
This motherfucker,

2294
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:46,640
he's playing like they're swimming 
pools.

2295
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:49,970
He's just slamming balls into the back 
of the pocket.

2296
01:53:49,971 --> 01:53:54,971
And it's shocking,
he just gets in that assassin groove 

2297
01:53:54,971 --> 01:53:59,050
where he can't miss and he's running six
and sevens on what I mean by six and 

2298
01:53:59,181 --> 01:54:04,181
sevens is six and seven racks in a row 
of 10 ball without missing braking and 

2299
01:54:04,911 --> 01:54:08,300
running a rack of 10 ball.
It's like nine ball.

2300
01:54:08,301 --> 01:54:13,301
You run the balls in the order,
but there's 10 and it's super fucking 

2301
01:54:13,301 --> 01:54:14,180
hard to do.
And this dude is like click off with the

2302
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:17,090
sound.
Just not missing.

2303
01:54:17,091 --> 01:54:19,430
Every ball is so precise.
His,

2304
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:23,620
he gets to the point where he's got that
cue ball on a string and it's like,

2305
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:25,360
he's like rolling the ball.
You,

2306
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:30,370
you've deScribed it.
It's like he's every ball is just 

2307
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:31,940
through the bone rolls through theirs.
It's a perfect delivery.

2308
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:34,690
And one of my favorite things about 
shane as a player,

2309
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:36,370
and like I said,
he's a friend of mine.

2310
01:54:36,371 --> 01:54:39,760
I've known him.
I met him in 2006 december,

2311
01:54:39,761 --> 01:54:43,540
2006 a long before I ever did this 
stuff.

2312
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:48,550
The actual import tars,
what it's called t a r a.

2313
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:51,670
We started in july of 2007.
But,

2314
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:56,700
uh,
so I've known shane and right now the 

2315
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:58,000
kid we're talking about is,
like I said,

2316
01:54:58,030 --> 01:55:00,370
in my opinion,
in a lot of other people's opinion,

2317
01:55:00,371 --> 01:55:05,371
the best american player,
he's one of the best in the world by 

2318
01:55:05,371 --> 01:55:05,371
any,
you know,

2319
01:55:05,770 --> 01:55:07,660
anybody's measure.
But,

2320
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:10,010
um,
he,

2321
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:15,540
he's still young,
but he is a guy that he,

2322
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:18,400
he goes a hundred percent every time he 
plays,

2323
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:23,020
but even if he loses,
he's able to take that.

2324
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,570
It doesn't fuck him up to the point 
where,

2325
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:28,750
and pull such a mental game.
Uh,

2326
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:29,650
sometimes.

2327
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:30,310
I mean,
it's,

2328
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:33,790
it's so crazy how mental have a game.
It is.

2329
01:55:34,330 --> 01:55:35,110
But,
uh,

2330
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:38,220
he could take,
he could take his last taken,

2331
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:39,990
come back was carried that.
But,

2332
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:42,160
but in a tournament he can take it and 
come back and win.

2333
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:44,370
But uh,
yeah,

2334
01:55:44,371 --> 01:55:46,980
it's,
it's a subculture that to me,

2335
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:50,390
there's a great quote in the movie,
uh,

2336
01:55:50,730 --> 01:55:53,840
the color of money and Paul Paul Newman,
if nobody,

2337
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,770
if I,
and I'm,

2338
01:55:56,010 --> 01:56:00,120
chances are maybe a lot of your viewers 
or listeners haven't seen that movie,

2339
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:02,670
but the color of money,
if you haven't seen it,

2340
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:05,190
check it out to Paul Newman,
a young tom cruise.

2341
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:10,820
But in that paul,
there's a scene where a Paul Newman has 

2342
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:15,630
a quote and these talking to tom 
cruise's girlfriend trying to get her to

2343
01:56:15,631 --> 01:56:20,631
convince crews to go out on the road and
he says basically,

2344
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:26,960
you know,
if you're the best in the world at 

2345
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:26,960
something,
no matter what it is,

2346
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:29,030
anything,
then rich can be arrange.

2347
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:32,400
Rich comes pretty eAsy.
And you know,

2348
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:37,490
he said,
and before that he had mentioned I 

2349
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:39,501
invest in excellence.
And to me that's what turns me on about 

2350
01:56:39,501 --> 01:56:43,720
anything what I do with pool or any 
cues,

2351
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,750
pool cues.
You're a cute guy too,

2352
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:48,390
but you know,
or anything,

2353
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:53,510
whatever the hell it is.
I'm interested in the people who do it 

2354
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:56,750
the best because to me that excellence,
you know,

2355
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:00,430
that's where the genius lies,
you know,

2356
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:05,760
because anybody can do anything,
but to me it's that ability,

2357
01:57:06,871 --> 01:57:08,760
whatever it is,
that human nature,

2358
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:13,110
that talent,
that drive to be excellent at something.

2359
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:18,440
It's a.
To me that fascinates me and it's 

2360
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:20,460
different for different people.
We were talking about like with pool,

2361
01:57:20,461 --> 01:57:25,461
it's such a mental game.
I joke a lot and it's only kind of half 

2362
01:57:25,461 --> 01:57:28,770
joking that to be really good at pool,
you've got to be about half nuts.

2363
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,570
Just barely half joke.
Yeah.

2364
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:32,990
I mean it's just you,
you,

2365
01:57:32,991 --> 01:57:37,991
you really,
because you have to give up so much of 

2366
01:57:37,991 --> 01:57:37,991
everything else.

2367
01:57:37,991 --> 01:57:39,680
People will never understand that don't 
play.

2368
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:42,660
When I was a kid,
when I lived in New York,

2369
01:57:42,690 --> 01:57:46,350
I played easily eight hours a day almost
every day.

2370
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:48,510
I constantly played pool and I wasn't 
very good,

2371
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:52,140
but I was obsessed with it.
And when you get to a point where you're

2372
01:57:52,141 --> 01:57:54,110
at the level of the high level 
professional,

2373
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:57,240
whether chain or african or you know any
of these top,

2374
01:57:57,241 --> 01:57:58,920
top name pros,
earl strickland,

2375
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:03,060
you,
you have to play all day every day.

2376
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:08,300
You have to be in the pool.
If you're out of the pool hall for a 

2377
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:08,300
day,
you fill out a stroke.

2378
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:08,670
If you take a day off,
you're like,

2379
01:58:08,671 --> 01:58:09,840
holy shit,
I'm out of stroke.

2380
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:14,960
Like guys have said that.
They took A day off and they came back 

2381
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:14,960
in there,
out of,

2382
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:14,960
struck me.
Even there,

2383
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:14,960
we're playing eight,
10 hours a day.

2384
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:15,210
And

2385
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:20,210
that's what's different about the elite,
the guys at shane's level is a lot of 

2386
01:58:20,581 --> 01:58:23,790
those guys don't play that much.
They don't do that.

2387
01:58:24,150 --> 01:58:25,650
They'll,
you know,

2388
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:29,010
they really don't play everyday putting 
in eight,

2389
01:58:29,011 --> 01:58:31,140
10 hours a day.
Like people wouldn't think they would.

2390
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:32,970
Yeah.
I mean they get to a certain level,

2391
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:36,930
they understand It.
And then you know,

2392
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,170
a lot of this because maybe they don't 
have to.

2393
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:45,620
But that's the difference with a guy 
like shane is he does these.

2394
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:48,310
And the other,
the flip side of this too though,

2395
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,680
is,
and I've had a couple players,

2396
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:55,740
we've talked about it and that is the 
fact that shane is a guy that is on the 

2397
01:58:56,081 --> 01:58:57,820
rise,
this is his ascendancy.

2398
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,940
He's 28 years old,
29,

2399
01:59:00,941 --> 01:59:03,130
something like that.
It's not married,

2400
01:59:03,131 --> 01:59:06,520
doesn't have any kids.
So you know,

2401
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:08,060
this is that,
this is,

2402
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:09,780
this is his,
you know,

2403
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:11,260
he's,
he's stars on the rise.

2404
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:14,530
So right now this is life man.
You know,

2405
01:59:14,531 --> 01:59:16,810
this is what he does.
He's a hundred percent focused.

2406
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:19,120
He doesn't worry about making this 
mortgage payment.

2407
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:20,700
He doesn't worry about,
you know,

2408
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:24,520
this is old lady mad at him because he 
decided to go do this or do that,

2409
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:26,350
you know,
he just,

2410
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:27,820
that's what he's doing

2411
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:30,680
and that's what it takes to be really 
excellent at something.

2412
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:31,640
I think so.
And,

2413
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:36,290
and every time in chains case when he's 
had some ups and downs,

2414
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:41,320
the downs all were related to the honey 
hole sun all related to that glorious 

2415
01:59:43,191 --> 01:59:45,260
thing that we're all searching for.
Yeah.

2416
01:59:45,261 --> 01:59:46,730
It's,
it's an interesting thing.

2417
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:47,660
You know,
the,

2418
01:59:47,661 --> 01:59:48,350
the,
the,

2419
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:50,810
the idea of excellence.
You and I agree on that,

2420
01:59:50,811 --> 01:59:52,550
you know,
we were both fascinated by that.

2421
01:59:52,551 --> 01:59:55,400
Especially we have,
we share the interest in queue.

2422
01:59:55,760 --> 02:00:00,760
People don't even know,
like there's a whole beautiful art to 

2423
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:00,760
making pool cues.
There are some.

2424
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:04,280
It's a functional art art form that's 
very,

2425
02:00:04,281 --> 02:00:09,281
very rare because it's got to have both.
Acu in order to be really revered has to

2426
02:00:10,791 --> 02:00:13,430
have playability and it has to have 
design.

2427
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:16,550
If acu Just has designed people,
don't give a fuck about it.

2428
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:20,060
Like if you get a cue from like 
southwest or john showman,

2429
02:00:20,330 --> 02:00:21,130
you get to see john.

2430
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:24,280
John was a perfect example.
It's like it doesn't make that many and,

2431
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:27,510
and the thing about the cues are that 
they play a,

2432
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:32,680
they have a balance and I have a,
a showman and it's like it's different 

2433
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:36,761
than any other steel jointed queue I've 
ever played with and it's because 

2434
02:00:36,761 --> 02:00:37,220
there's,
this dude just has a way of making shit.

2435
02:00:37,221 --> 02:00:39,770
He knows what he's doing.
He figured it out.

2436
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:44,800
He knows how to splice things together 
and send them correctly and cure the 

2437
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,860
wood.
And I mean,

2438
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:50,890
it's a really beautiful functional art 
form that's slowly being lost,

2439
02:00:51,170 --> 02:00:52,110
right?
And you know,

2440
02:00:52,230 --> 02:00:57,230
you bring up john and he's a,
he's an example of one of the things,

2441
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:01,490
you know,
excellent.

2442
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:06,520
Like I was talking about is something 
that really excites me anD it interests 

2443
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,330
me.
And the other thing is craftsmanship.

2444
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:10,830
The people that make things,
um,

2445
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:13,640
whether that's knives,
guns,

2446
02:01:13,641 --> 02:01:15,690
pool cues,
people guys.

2447
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:16,100
Cool.
Yeah.

2448
02:01:16,130 --> 02:01:16,840
Anything.
Yeah.

2449
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:21,140
Guys in mostly for the most part,
people that do it,

2450
02:01:21,650 --> 02:01:24,860
one man shops or one or two man shops,
you know,

2451
02:01:24,861 --> 02:01:27,890
a guy gets.
Because I have a background,

2452
02:01:27,891 --> 02:01:32,891
like I said,
a machining background and things like 

2453
02:01:32,891 --> 02:01:34,841
that.
So I have a basic understanding of what 

2454
02:01:34,841 --> 02:01:38,921
it takes to make something,
to take it from a drawing on a piece of 

2455
02:01:38,921 --> 02:01:42,311
paper to a block metal or whatever,
or a bunch of have been full of parts 

2456
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:48,400
and turn it into something.
And I know how god damn difficult that 

2457
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,500
is.
And then to,

2458
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:55,520
to be able to do that at a very high 
level to where you have people wanting 

2459
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,700
to pay thousands and thousands of 
dollars for what you do.

2460
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:04,010
That to me is one of the coolest things 
in the world.

2461
02:02:04,570 --> 02:02:09,570
And I'm john's a friend of mine and I've
been to a shop and he's for people and I

2462
02:02:12,231 --> 02:02:15,290
realized we're talking about something 
people don't know about or understand,

2463
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:20,710
but he makes these cues and a high end 
pool cue starts about 2,500

2464
02:02:22,181 --> 02:02:25,580
to $3,000
and can go up to $10,000.

2465
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:28,240
And a lot of these cues,
uh,

2466
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:31,760
like many things with high demand,
um,

2467
02:02:31,790 --> 02:02:33,920
if you can buy it directly from the 
source,

2468
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:39,040
uh,
you actually get it for cheaper than 

2469
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:39,040
what the secondary market is so you can 
actually flip it.

2470
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:41,720
And so.
And it's the same way with knives.

2471
02:02:41,890 --> 02:02:46,890
I'm a,
that's my new freak thing is a custom 

2472
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:48,260
foLding knives.
But.

2473
02:02:48,261 --> 02:02:53,261
So anyway,
john makes these jews out of a one car 

2474
02:02:53,261 --> 02:02:53,920
garage.
I went and shot a did.

2475
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:55,610
Uh,
did you ever see the documentary?

2476
02:02:55,610 --> 02:02:57,680
I did.
Really interesting stuff.

2477
02:02:57,830 --> 02:03:02,830
He makes these cues in a one car garage 
and if I showed it to you like at a 

2478
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:07,490
accustomed q show that they have,
they do have um,

2479
02:03:07,491 --> 02:03:10,160
things like that or some just weld on 
photographs.

2480
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:16,090
It looks like a work of art.
I mean his stuff is just so well 

2481
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:19,451
executed and you kind of have to ask 
them knowledge to know what you're 

2482
02:03:19,451 --> 02:03:21,590
looking at because things were even,
you know,

2483
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:23,980
things like that.
BuT it's,

2484
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:25,570
it's,
it's an interesting thing.

2485
02:03:25,571 --> 02:03:30,571
It's hard to describe it is don't,
don't have anything to do with when you 

2486
02:03:30,571 --> 02:03:33,080
see where it's made.
I mean if you just look at this item,

2487
02:03:33,081 --> 02:03:34,130
you'd go,
okay shit,

2488
02:03:34,131 --> 02:03:36,290
that's pretty okay.
And then you.

2489
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:40,080
And then you kind of have to explain to 
people that it's would you know,

2490
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:43,220
this is a round piece of wood that's 
tapered,

2491
02:03:43,610 --> 02:03:48,470
that's got big ass cuts in it with parts
of it pulled out and then other parts of

2492
02:03:48,471 --> 02:03:52,370
it glued back in where you took that 
shit out of and perfectly.

2493
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,040
Yeah.
And then little pieces of,

2494
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:56,090
of wood cut out.
A lot of people don't even know what the

2495
02:03:56,091 --> 02:04:00,200
inlay is or understand it for any an 
inlay in anything,

2496
02:04:00,201 --> 02:04:03,830
whether it's a pool cue or you see a lot
of it in jewelry boxes.

2497
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:05,360
Um,
some,

2498
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:08,420
some furniture has a lot of inlay.
What they'll do,

2499
02:04:08,970 --> 02:04:12,200
say you've got a circle and you've got 
made out of ivory,

2500
02:04:12,230 --> 02:04:17,230
let's say,
and you've got a nice wooden table and 

2501
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:17,230
you want to put the circle of ivory in 
it.

2502
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:20,570
What you do is you go in and you mail 
out a circle,

2503
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:23,270
so you cut out the wood and leave a hole
there.

2504
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:26,150
Then you take your piece of ivory,
you glue it in,

2505
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:31,100
and then you sand it or millet flat.
And then so now it looks like you've got

2506
02:04:31,101 --> 02:04:32,970
a nice piece of wood with a piece of 
ivory there.

2507
02:04:33,700 --> 02:04:36,200
Now if you take that and you multiply 
it,

2508
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:41,210
I think the queue you've got of john's.
I saw it when he delivered it initially 

2509
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:47,120
at super bowl expo.
I want to say it's like a hundred and 

2510
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:49,731
some inlays.
So imagine doing that hundred times.

2511
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:55,700
And now here's the trick.
If you fuck up on the 99th time,

2512
02:04:56,610 --> 02:04:59,400
you got to start over and they do all 
the time.

2513
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:04,670
They'll be working on high end cues and 
they'll get like three quarters of the 

2514
02:05:04,670 --> 02:05:04,670
way done.
They have to scrap it.

2515
02:05:04,670 --> 02:05:05,400
Ernie.
Ernie,

2516
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:08,190
as gina acu.
I did a film with him.

2517
02:05:08,191 --> 02:05:13,191
That's on our youtube channel.
He's had to solve cues and half ivory 

2518
02:05:13,711 --> 02:05:16,200
handled cues.
Oh yeah.

2519
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:21,260
He's,
I mean it's because it goes back to the 

2520
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:25,581
craftsmanship aspect of no matter what 
it is you make,

2521
02:05:25,951 --> 02:05:30,951
you talk about cars.
I know you love cars and you're a car 

2522
02:05:30,951 --> 02:05:30,951
guy.

2523
02:05:30,951 --> 02:05:34,130
You know,
you get these custom tuners are custom 

2524
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:34,130
builders,
you know,

2525
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:36,450
if they have a dog,
they can't afford that to be out there.

2526
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:39,750
They can't let that.
They can't let that car on the road.

2527
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:43,870
Right.
Because one dog will fuck up 100.

2528
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:45,990
You know,
you know the old saying,

2529
02:05:45,991 --> 02:05:48,600
you know one oh shit overrules 100 
attaboys.

2530
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:49,680
Yeah,
that's true.

2531
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:50,880
So you know,
it,

2532
02:05:50,881 --> 02:05:51,630
it,
it's,

2533
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,480
I don't know.
To me that's the whole thing.

2534
02:05:54,481 --> 02:05:57,090
And the other thing about q makers that 
world,

2535
02:05:57,660 --> 02:06:02,660
it's really fascinating is a,
those dudes are the coolest 

2536
02:06:03,061 --> 02:06:06,480
motherfuckers across the board and the 
entire pool world.

2537
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:09,300
Those guys,
perfect example,

2538
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:10,770
a guy we both know,
eric,

2539
02:06:10,771 --> 02:06:14,400
chris,
a guy who makes a very,

2540
02:06:14,401 --> 02:06:17,490
very in demand cues,
cues are called sugartree cues.

2541
02:06:17,850 --> 02:06:19,650
When we first started our business,
our,

2542
02:06:19,651 --> 02:06:22,140
our company,
it was complete shoe string.

2543
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:25,140
It was me and my partner Chad a pullman.

2544
02:06:25,670 --> 02:06:30,670
We'd started up and uh,
just we had to initial partners that 

2545
02:06:31,261 --> 02:06:33,450
came in a truck.
And jason,

2546
02:06:33,451 --> 02:06:38,451
I just want to mention their names 
because they were important and what we 

2547
02:06:38,451 --> 02:06:38,451
did.
But,

2548
02:06:38,451 --> 02:06:39,930
um,
it was a shoestring deal.

2549
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:42,030
And anyway,
this,

2550
02:06:42,031 --> 02:06:43,050
uh,
eric,

2551
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:45,120
who's become a good friend of joe in 
mind,

2552
02:06:45,121 --> 02:06:47,730
both out of nowhere,
this guy,

2553
02:06:47,731 --> 02:06:50,460
he's a very,
very in demand q maker at the time.

2554
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:53,670
Got a,
got a backlog of years and years.

2555
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:57,030
But that means if you wanted to buy a 
cue from them,

2556
02:06:57,031 --> 02:06:59,910
you got to wait years and anymore where 
you can even build it.

2557
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:02,460
And eric in particular doesn't even take
orders anymore.

2558
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:03,480
So,
I mean,

2559
02:07:03,481 --> 02:07:05,160
you just,
if you want one of his cues,

2560
02:07:05,161 --> 02:07:07,620
you have to either know him or get it on
the secondary market.

2561
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:08,910
But,
uh,

2562
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:14,190
I was at an event,
it was 2008 and I was a photographer and

2563
02:07:14,191 --> 02:07:16,920
when I started my company,
I had to sell a,

2564
02:07:17,070 --> 02:07:19,320
one of my camera lenses to pay for a 
trip.

2565
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:21,660
And then for many photographers out 
there,

2566
02:07:21,661 --> 02:07:26,250
it was a nikon 70 to 200 to eight,
about a $1,500

2567
02:07:26,251 --> 02:07:28,590
lens.
But we're going on this trip.

2568
02:07:28,591 --> 02:07:32,430
I didn't have any money,
so I had to sell this lens and uh,

2569
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,230
didn't really tell anybody about it,
but it,

2570
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:40,260
it was to me,
it was a one of those things where it's 

2571
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:40,260
like,
fuck man,

2572
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:43,231
I don't want to do.
It's like you don't want to sell your 

2573
02:07:43,231 --> 02:07:43,231
tools,
you know what I mean?

2574
02:07:43,231 --> 02:07:43,231
But,
uh,

2575
02:07:43,231 --> 02:07:45,700
we had made a commItment to be there and
so I did what I had to do.

2576
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:48,040
So anyway,
we're,

2577
02:07:48,110 --> 02:07:53,110
we're in an event maybe six,
seven months later and eric walks up 

2578
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:53,940
and,
uh,

2579
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:57,400
out of nowhere he hands me a cue.
He goes,

2580
02:07:57,401 --> 02:07:58,330
here,
take this.

2581
02:07:58,331 --> 02:08:00,910
And use it to help you guys get doWn the
road.

2582
02:08:01,690 --> 02:08:02,980
And I was,
I was stunned.

2583
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:06,520
I,
I'd never met Him before and you know,

2584
02:08:06,521 --> 02:08:08,380
we started talking but,
and,

2585
02:08:08,381 --> 02:08:10,780
and that sounds,
that doesn't sound like much,

2586
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:11,640
uh,
you know,

2587
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:13,930
somebody walk out and handing you a 
piece of wood or piece of pork,

2588
02:08:13,931 --> 02:08:16,300
you.
But the thing is he walked up and handed

2589
02:08:16,301 --> 02:08:17,890
me two grand.
Yeah.

2590
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,200
He's one of the nicest guys I've ever 
met and you know,

2591
02:08:20,201 --> 02:08:25,201
and,
and what I did was I've taken a lot of 

2592
02:08:25,201 --> 02:08:28,021
photos and um,
I've got some photos to unique photos 

2593
02:08:28,021 --> 02:08:29,620
because I've been in places,
you know,

2594
02:08:29,621 --> 02:08:33,700
the old saying about being good at 
photography is f eight and be there,

2595
02:08:34,150 --> 02:08:39,150
you know,
I've been lucky to be there for certain 

2596
02:08:39,150 --> 02:08:39,580
things and a lot of my photos that have 
been taken.

2597
02:08:39,690 --> 02:08:43,010
The f eight and f eight is an f stop.
What does that mean?

2598
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:48,820
Lends adjustment,
which it's basically f eight is in the 

2599
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:48,820
middle of the focal range.

2600
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:54,060
So it allows you a depth of field to 
where you can see like if you're going 

2601
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:58,520
to take a general photograph effect,
a good spot to be so far and just be 

2602
02:08:58,520 --> 02:08:59,290
there and you got to go to the picture.
Yeah.

2603
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:02,130
F eight and be there.
It was kind of the joke about you.

2604
02:09:02,150 --> 02:09:05,740
You don't have to do any fancy trickery 
or anything like that.

2605
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:10,180
The big thing is have a basic setup but 
be there when the shot is there.

2606
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:11,290
Gotcha.
Okay.

2607
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:12,270
Cool.
And uh,

2608
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:18,000
but I use that cue to purchase that lens
that I had sold before.

2609
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:21,610
And since then a lot of,
almost everything.

2610
02:09:21,611 --> 02:09:22,480
You see,
any,

2611
02:09:22,481 --> 02:09:27,481
any one of the flyers,
any type of like promotional shit that 

2612
02:09:27,481 --> 02:09:31,471
we do.
That photo was taken with the lens that 

2613
02:09:31,471 --> 02:09:32,110
I was able to buy because eric gave me 
that cue.

2614
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:33,850
Yeah.
It's an interesting thing,

2615
02:09:33,851 --> 02:09:38,680
that world of craftsmanship,
of creating this really unique tool that

2616
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:42,070
is very revered within the community.

2617
02:09:42,370 --> 02:09:47,370
What the community is like.
It's a weird kind of sketchy falling 

2618
02:09:47,370 --> 02:09:47,810
apart community.
The,

2619
02:09:47,870 --> 02:09:52,870
the customer.
There's a queue collecting commune and 

2620
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:52,870
that's pool.
So spread out man.

2621
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:57,440
And now it's even more fucked up,
but I'm pulling these is show the high 

2622
02:09:57,440 --> 02:10:01,150
end pool cue.
Collector guys are rich.

2623
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:03,100
You can't not,
you can't play in that.

2624
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:06,310
You can't play in that end of the pool 
and not be wealthy.

2625
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:07,720
Um,
you know,

2626
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:10,690
when an average queue costing four to 
5,000

2627
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:16,080
highend cues like old cues,
like there's certain shoemakers,

2628
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:18,070
like balla bush got a lot of people have
heard of,

2629
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:21,340
if you've ever seen the color of money,
the named ballot bush goes,

2630
02:10:21,341 --> 02:10:26,341
brought up those cues now,
eight to $25,000

2631
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:31,620
anywhere,
depending on how fancy because of that 

2632
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:31,620
movie.
Yes.

2633
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:31,620
Well,
no,

2634
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:32,980
because there he's dead yet.
There is no,

2635
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:33,730
you know,

2636
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:37,460
he's really extreme on the end of the 
collectors that high end,

2637
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:39,820
high berries and bodie who is.
Yeah.

2638
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:42,280
Cool level.
Who this,

2639
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:47,030
his dad gestapo those cues.
Those are also like same level,

2640
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:48,360
same level about bush gullible.

2641
02:10:48,490 --> 02:10:49,180
Oh gosh.
Cute.

2642
02:10:49,210 --> 02:10:50,650
Actually,
I think gus cues,

2643
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:55,680
certain gus cues go carry a higher level
of price in zamboni gustin body cues 

2644
02:10:58,810 --> 02:11:00,340
were better made.

2645
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:06,010
The playability is legendary and a lot 
of great players played with a zamboni 

2646
02:11:06,630 --> 02:11:08,490
zamboni.
He's just one of those names like you,

2647
02:11:08,491 --> 02:11:11,750
he hear the names and bodie.
That's like the real,

2648
02:11:11,751 --> 02:11:16,751
like in this day and age like you here 
at ballah bush baumbusch who is always 

2649
02:11:16,751 --> 02:11:16,751
impressive,
but zamboni is like,

2650
02:11:16,751 --> 02:11:17,210
oh,
he's going to zamboni like,

2651
02:11:17,220 --> 02:11:18,620
oh shit.
Yeah,

2652
02:11:18,621 --> 02:11:21,140
that's high level shit.
And that's one thing.

2653
02:11:21,141 --> 02:11:25,850
And showman too much of more obscure 
with the same level.

2654
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:27,060
You know,
I think john,

2655
02:11:27,090 --> 02:11:30,330
among the cognitive one,
the people who know,

2656
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:34,740
and that's one of the cool things is 
john and barry,

2657
02:11:34,830 --> 02:11:39,180
sam bodie are friends and they have a 
lot in common with some of their,

2658
02:11:39,210 --> 02:11:44,210
you know,
they like the traditional style design 

2659
02:11:44,210 --> 02:11:44,210
work and things like that.
And uh,

2660
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:46,440
so that,
it's a small,

2661
02:11:46,441 --> 02:11:49,290
small world,
but it's really fascinating.

2662
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:51,480
And the other thing that's interesting 
is,

2663
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:53,700
um,
you know,

2664
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:56,520
if somebody out there today said,
okay cool,

2665
02:11:56,521 --> 02:11:58,800
I want to learn more about these cues,
and they find out,

2666
02:11:58,801 --> 02:11:59,910
you know,
and you want to go get one,

2667
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:01,620
you can't buy one.
Yeah,

2668
02:12:01,770 --> 02:12:03,150
good luck.
I mean,

2669
02:12:03,151 --> 02:12:08,151
you can buy one on the secondary market,
but it'd be ridiculously priced and 

2670
02:12:08,151 --> 02:12:09,990
super expensive if.
But if you call barry,

2671
02:12:10,290 --> 02:12:12,900
he might take your call on and he'll be 
gracious to you,

2672
02:12:13,650 --> 02:12:16,530
but barry's never going to fill his 
order book.

2673
02:12:17,070 --> 02:12:17,660
You know,
he,

2674
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:18,330
he,
I mean,

2675
02:12:18,331 --> 02:12:19,520
I love the guy to death.
God,

2676
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:22,080
god bless him.
I hope he lives to be 100 years old,

2677
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:24,660
but chances are he's never going to fill
his order book

2678
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:29,870
because so many people want.
It's just a matter of demand that he 

2679
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:29,870
has.
Yeah,

2680
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:31,790
and you said cognitive sending,
one of my best accuses a joe goal,

2681
02:12:31,870 --> 02:12:34,170
goal cognitive.
Accuse these,

2682
02:12:34,171 --> 02:12:39,171
this small group of people that make 
these high end instruments for this 

2683
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:43,540
obscure dying game and it is dying.
But to a guy like you are,

2684
02:12:43,610 --> 02:12:45,270
um,
guy like you were shy.

2685
02:12:45,271 --> 02:12:50,271
They were extremely valuable because we 
recognize like if you can get ahold of 

2686
02:12:50,271 --> 02:12:50,850
an ebony on avenue southwest,
you're like,

2687
02:12:50,851 --> 02:12:53,940
holy shit.
Like it's almost like you're,

2688
02:12:53,941 --> 02:12:55,620
you're,
you know,

2689
02:12:55,621 --> 02:12:58,550
you're obligated to buy it because he 
realized like this.

2690
02:12:58,710 --> 02:13:01,890
They're not making that many of these.
There's gonna come a point in time where

2691
02:13:01,891 --> 02:13:04,320
you run out of 58 corvettes that don't 
exist anymore,

2692
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:07,320
right?
There's no more 58 corvettes and shit.

2693
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:09,790
And that's where a lot of the older q 
guys,

2694
02:13:09,820 --> 02:13:10,570
uh,
you know,

2695
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:12,660
like we were speaking about the older 
makers,

2696
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:13,620
gus,
sam,

2697
02:13:13,650 --> 02:13:14,720
bodie,
ballad,

2698
02:13:14,740 --> 02:13:19,740
bush.
And then you have guys like john 

2699
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:22,651
shullman.
I think john shullman went through a 

2700
02:13:22,651 --> 02:13:22,960
period of time where he might've made 10
q's in three years.

2701
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:24,430
Yeah,
I mean,

2702
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:29,700
when we talk about these guys a perfect.
Another perfect example is dennis 

2703
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:32,300
searing a who is arguably a lot of cute 
guys,

2704
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:34,780
considered the top guy.
Um,

2705
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:37,950
his cues probably have the highest 
resale value.

2706
02:13:38,430 --> 02:13:39,750
They're insane.
Yeah.

2707
02:13:39,870 --> 02:13:41,090
Insane.
Like a plain cubes,

2708
02:13:41,091 --> 02:13:42,620
like 4,000,
5,000,

2709
02:13:42,621 --> 02:13:45,230
$6,000
grand for what looks like a house q.

2710
02:13:45,650 --> 02:13:50,650
It's um,
it's an amazing thing that a guy's 

2711
02:13:50,650 --> 02:13:53,930
excellence commitment to exacting 
standards can really be,

2712
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:55,910
can manifest itself in that sort of a 
way.

2713
02:13:55,911 --> 02:14:00,911
And that's what in that way,
that's where pool cues and that's where 

2714
02:14:00,911 --> 02:14:03,200
this,
this art form sort of like,

2715
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:03,510
it,
it,

2716
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:06,000
it parallels everything else in life.
Like,

2717
02:14:06,050 --> 02:14:08,690
it's the same thing as like if the 
beatles were playing,

2718
02:14:08,750 --> 02:14:10,490
everybody wants to go and see them,
you know,

2719
02:14:10,491 --> 02:14:15,491
it really is the same thing almost.
It's like this just this boundless 

2720
02:14:16,191 --> 02:14:16,700
energy

2721
02:14:16,810 --> 02:14:21,810
to achieve excellence and that's what.
And it's in this very specific space for

2722
02:14:22,601 --> 02:14:27,601
this very specific purpose that maybe 
four or 5,000

2723
02:14:28,571 --> 02:14:32,650
people on this earth will understand or 
get or give a fuck.

2724
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:33,460
Yeah.
Or give a fuck.

2725
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:36,760
My wife looks at my pool cues and works 
with the fuck is wrong with you.

2726
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,680
It was a shit.
Oh that one's pretty.

2727
02:14:39,710 --> 02:14:41,530
Couldn't care less.
And I'm like,

2728
02:14:41,531 --> 02:14:42,310
you know,
but you know what,

2729
02:14:42,311 --> 02:14:44,590
that's the way I feel about watches.
Yeah.

2730
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:46,220
You know,
I see guys and,

2731
02:14:46,221 --> 02:14:46,960
and they,
you know,

2732
02:14:46,961 --> 02:14:49,720
they can blow 100 grand on a watch and 
love that shit.

2733
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,340
I love that shit.
It's like,

2734
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:56,850
you know,
dudes get disappointed when they see my 

2735
02:14:56,850 --> 02:14:56,850
wife sometimes

2736
02:14:56,850 --> 02:15:00,420
cause they're expecting you to have some
will have a nice watch that Russell 

2737
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:00,710
Peters gave me.
Russell peters gave me a breitling.

2738
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:03,380
It's fucking beautiful watch.
I would never spend that much money.

2739
02:15:03,381 --> 02:15:06,380
And the ufc gave me a rolex so I have to
legit watches,

2740
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:08,690
but I'm wearing a watch.
It cost like 50 bucks.

2741
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:12,290
I wish I'm bang,
I'm in this shit.

2742
02:15:12,310 --> 02:15:14,590
I know what time it is.
I'm not trying to impress anybody.

2743
02:15:14,591 --> 02:15:16,910
Meanwhile you've got a rack full of 
$5,000.

2744
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:20,930
My interest is not in the oppressing 
other people.

2745
02:15:21,140 --> 02:15:22,910
I'm interested in what I'm interested 
in,

2746
02:15:23,030 --> 02:15:27,050
you know,
like my car a 2007 and I'm not trying to

2747
02:15:27,051 --> 02:15:28,880
get a 2014.
I like.

2748
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:31,200
I like what I like,
you know when I,

2749
02:15:31,390 --> 02:15:33,680
I need to.
I just need to find out what's the right

2750
02:15:33,681 --> 02:15:34,560
shit.
What's the.

2751
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:37,060
What's the shit that makes you feel best
is,

2752
02:15:37,190 --> 02:15:38,510
is it this?

2753
02:15:38,510 --> 02:15:40,850
Is it that as a,
the watching them.

2754
02:15:40,851 --> 02:15:42,830
That doesn't make me feel good.
That makes me feel like an idiot.

2755
02:15:43,250 --> 02:15:44,240
WhY is that?
Watch.

2756
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:46,310
Why doesn't it have a battery?
What?

2757
02:15:46,330 --> 02:15:48,560
After winding with my hand.
ThAt's so stupid.

2758
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:51,650
Do you know there's a battery now is 
unlimited supply.

2759
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:56,660
then they stick it in.
Do you know the watches with a battery 

2760
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:57,680
costs $4.
The fuck is wrong with people.

2761
02:15:57,860 --> 02:15:58,810
Dude.
I got a um,

2762
02:15:58,870 --> 02:16:00,290
a timex.
What is it,

2763
02:16:00,291 --> 02:16:01,220
a one of those,
uh,

2764
02:16:01,221 --> 02:16:02,530
those ironman?
Yeah,

2765
02:16:02,630 --> 02:16:03,400
iron man.
I wear it.

2766
02:16:03,401 --> 02:16:05,300
When I went hunting,
I bought it for hunting.

2767
02:16:05,510 --> 02:16:09,140
It's my favorite watch.
That motherfucker gave me no problems.

2768
02:16:09,141 --> 02:16:11,450
Give me a little light.
I was in the middle of Montana,

2769
02:16:11,670 --> 02:16:12,980
you know,
like that's my watch.

2770
02:16:12,981 --> 02:16:17,981
I love that watch I want to use.
That's like a sacred watch to me and 

2771
02:16:17,981 --> 02:16:21,390
that,
that watch is like the cheapest watch I 

2772
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:21,390
own.
But it has significance.

2773
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:22,430
It means something.
That was,

2774
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:25,190
that was the watch I wore the first time
I killed a deer.

2775
02:16:25,490 --> 02:16:26,210
Yeah,
that's good.

2776
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:27,820
It means something that's kind of the 
watch.

2777
02:16:27,821 --> 02:16:30,220
It's got guts on it.
I wrote story about a guy,

2778
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:34,930
a dude.
It was a special forces team.

2779
02:16:34,931 --> 02:16:37,780
Guy rolls into the team room and he 
showed office now.

2780
02:16:37,781 --> 02:16:38,770
Sf.
Sf.

2781
02:16:38,830 --> 02:16:41,800
Sorry.
I was rolling in and he had a rolex on.

2782
02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:43,420
He was like,
check this shit.

2783
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:44,470
And the guy goes,
oh,

2784
02:16:44,471 --> 02:16:45,700
that's cool.
Can you do this with it?

2785
02:16:45,701 --> 02:16:50,701
And he takes off his $60 g shock and he 
throws it across the room and hits the 

2786
02:16:50,701 --> 02:16:50,860
law.
He goes,

2787
02:16:50,861 --> 02:16:51,880
let's see you do that buddy.

2788
02:16:54,290 --> 02:16:59,290
Well,
this is a weird thing we're doing with 

2789
02:16:59,290 --> 02:17:00,650
watches and cars and this is where it's 
wrong.

2790
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:06,040
It's wrong if you're in trying to 
impress other people if you're wrong,

2791
02:17:06,291 --> 02:17:09,920
if you're spending your entire life 
savings to try to live in the house that

2792
02:17:09,921 --> 02:17:12,200
everyone envies.
It's right.

2793
02:17:12,350 --> 02:17:17,350
If you have this idea for a house,
I've always wanted to live in a log 

2794
02:17:17,350 --> 02:17:17,390
house.
Let's make this shit happen.

2795
02:17:17,630 --> 02:17:18,800
Fuck,
I'm there.

2796
02:17:18,801 --> 02:17:23,801
I got a log house.
Like if you enjoy the art of the log 

2797
02:17:23,801 --> 02:17:27,551
house.
But there's a lot of people wearing 

2798
02:17:27,551 --> 02:17:27,551
those hundred thousand dollars watches 
that are just like fucking sticking that

2799
02:17:27,551 --> 02:17:29,060
shit in your face.
Letting you know.

2800
02:17:29,061 --> 02:17:30,680
It's like,
it's like bad bad.

2801
02:17:30,681 --> 02:17:35,681
Leroy brown likes to wear a diamond ring
and fund a heavier bat about his nose 

2802
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:40,460
and a bad bad leave brown.
That's what.

2803
02:17:40,490 --> 02:17:45,490
That's the stupidity of it all.
The stupidity of it all is not buying a 

2804
02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:48,881
porsche to stupidity of is all of it.
All is needing people around you to 

2805
02:17:48,881 --> 02:17:48,881
appreciate that

2806
02:17:48,881 --> 02:17:49,670
porsche.
Yeah.

2807
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:54,870
To me,
the guy who buys the porsche because he 

2808
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:57,520
gets off on the history and the 
performance and he understands it and he

2809
02:17:57,521 --> 02:17:59,140
drives it.
To me.

2810
02:17:59,230 --> 02:18:02,050
I think that's coolest shit.
You're fucking dentist.

2811
02:18:02,051 --> 02:18:05,570
Who buys the porsche that doesn't 
understand how to drive a stick shift is

2812
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:06,280
a douchebag.

2813
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:12,070
Well,
there's the saddest thing is when I see 

2814
02:18:12,070 --> 02:18:14,201
a guy's in nine slash 11,
I look over and he doesn't even have 

2815
02:18:14,201 --> 02:18:17,830
paddle shifters.
She's got that automatic with the 

2816
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:17,830
buttons on the steering wheel.
I'm like,

2817
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:22,451
you fucking slob,
blah blah,

2818
02:18:23,510 --> 02:18:27,530
and we're engineering or I shouldn't say
we because as I've stated earlier,

2819
02:18:27,531 --> 02:18:32,531
I'm an idiot.
I'm not engineering anything but even 

2820
02:18:32,531 --> 02:18:35,981
porsche,
their engineering away from the 

2821
02:18:35,981 --> 02:18:36,340
transmission,
there's no more manual transfers.

2822
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:40,430
That was always the thing with the nine 
slash 11 was that it was a fucking death

2823
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:45,440
mobutu.
I mean if you didn't know what the fuck 

2824
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:45,440
you were doing,
it would kill you for functional.

2825
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:46,590
No,
the porsche they

2826
02:18:47,070 --> 02:18:48,060
a long,
long,

2827
02:18:48,061 --> 02:18:50,400
long time ago.
Back before anybody read books,

2828
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:52,620
they put the engine in the back of the 
car,

2829
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:56,460
it's behind the,
it's behind the rear axle.

2830
02:18:56,461 --> 02:19:01,461
It's a stupid place for the engine and 
back then the cars only weighed 2000 

2831
02:19:02,371 --> 02:19:07,371
plus pounds.
They only had 150 horsepower at the 

2832
02:19:07,371 --> 02:19:07,420
most,
you know,

2833
02:19:07,470 --> 02:19:12,470
when they were designing these things,
they had really narrow tires and they 

2834
02:19:12,470 --> 02:19:16,701
were really slippery.
Like if you went around a corner and 

2835
02:19:16,701 --> 02:19:16,701
your gun,
the gas the wrong time,

2836
02:19:16,701 --> 02:19:20,601
your asset with totally kicked out there
were notorious for what's called 

2837
02:19:20,601 --> 02:19:24,470
oversteering,
meaning like as you're turning the car 

2838
02:19:24,470 --> 02:19:28,011
steers further than you would like it to
and some people out how to drive with 

2839
02:19:28,191 --> 02:19:29,730
that.
They figured out how to walk,

2840
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:34,750
brought,
brought in the rear axle or broaden the 

2841
02:19:34,750 --> 02:19:35,630
tires,
rather stretch out the,

2842
02:19:35,631 --> 02:19:36,980
uh,
the real,

2843
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:42,130
the rear stance,
and then figuring out how to accelerate 

2844
02:19:42,130 --> 02:19:42,130
at a corner,
go into them slow.

2845
02:19:42,130 --> 02:19:45,770
But then the traction of having the 
weight below the back wheels like allows

2846
02:19:45,771 --> 02:19:50,771
you to actually kick off quicker.
It allows you to very fast zero to 60 

2847
02:19:50,771 --> 02:19:52,430
acceleration.
There's like a lot of good things.

2848
02:19:52,670 --> 02:19:57,670
If you know how to drive,
got the ass on the drive wheels so it 

2849
02:19:57,670 --> 02:20:00,851
puts the weight over him,
but it's interesting because they 

2850
02:20:00,851 --> 02:20:03,190
basically have spent the past several 
decades trying to engineer their way 

2851
02:20:03,651 --> 02:20:06,650
around a terrible idea and they have 
another car.

2852
02:20:06,651 --> 02:20:10,130
Here's the number one problem.
Porsche has a call called the caYman and

2853
02:20:10,131 --> 02:20:12,530
the cayman's there.
You should call iT entry.

2854
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:12,790
No,
no,

2855
02:20:12,791 --> 02:20:13,760
no.
That's the cayenne.

2856
02:20:13,790 --> 02:20:14,570
Cayenne.
What's the?

2857
02:20:14,620 --> 02:20:19,550
Cayman is a very small mid engine car 
and it's a beautiful car now.

2858
02:20:19,551 --> 02:20:22,190
It used to be ugly as shit back when 
portia had the nine,

2859
02:20:22,191 --> 02:20:22,940
nine,
six,

2860
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:23,650
the nine,
nine.

2861
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:26,780
Six was the first water cooled.
What was cheap when?

2862
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:27,800
What was the,
uh,

2863
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:30,980
that's the boxster box.
The boxers that came in with a roof over

2864
02:20:30,981 --> 02:20:33,020
it.
But see the boxster,

2865
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:34,490
that's the cayman.
That's the new one.

2866
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:38,180
It's dope as fuck.
But they have to keep an underpowered.

2867
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:40,790
You know why?
Because it's not a rear engine car.

2868
02:20:40,791 --> 02:20:43,520
It's a mid engine car.
So it's balanced as much better.

2869
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:47,330
It handles much better.
Its acceleration is prime.

2870
02:20:47,331 --> 02:20:51,020
It's beautiful.
And so they have to keep it about 3:25,

2871
02:20:51,021 --> 02:20:52,780
3:50,
maximum athletic.

2872
02:20:52,850 --> 02:20:54,740
We're talking about 3:50
is under powered.

2873
02:20:54,850 --> 02:20:59,850
It's powered.
My porsche has 502 years.

2874
02:21:00,350 --> 02:21:01,650
Our role driver.
Uh,

2875
02:21:01,670 --> 02:21:02,040
no,
no,

2876
02:21:02,041 --> 02:21:02,480
no,
no,

2877
02:21:02,481 --> 02:21:02,780
no,
no.

2878
02:21:02,781 --> 02:21:04,520
It's rear wheel drive.
I'm a savage.

2879
02:21:04,521 --> 02:21:07,650
I'm a man for that fucking all wheel 
drive.

2880
02:21:07,810 --> 02:21:10,690
that's the government trying to shrink 
your deck.

2881
02:21:11,140 --> 02:21:13,910
I saw that is they're trying to take 
away your testosterone.

2882
02:21:14,210 --> 02:21:17,030
The rear drive is where it's at.
If you're going to drive a sports car,

2883
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:22,031
especially a porsche,
it's rear wheel drive and it's a wide 

2884
02:21:22,031 --> 02:21:22,031
body.

2885
02:21:22,031 --> 02:21:24,350
Shut the fuck up.
It's supposed to have a big fat rear set

2886
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:29,351
of tires and a lot of god damn power.
And you better know what the fuck 

2887
02:21:29,351 --> 02:21:29,351
happens when that 60 slash 40 gets out 
of whack.

2888
02:21:29,351 --> 02:21:33,730
You gotta know how to counter steer so 
sick in New York.

2889
02:21:33,790 --> 02:21:38,790
he should go naturally aspirated to stop
fucking around with those turbo 

2890
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:38,790
chargers.
Yeah,

2891
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:43,241
they're cute and everything,
but they don't even make the same sound 

2892
02:21:43,241 --> 02:21:44,150
like half of the fun of an engine.
what about your mustang?

2893
02:21:44,151 --> 02:21:45,800
Your mustang's got a surplus 
supercharging.

2894
02:21:45,801 --> 02:21:46,820
Yeah,
but that's okay.

2895
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:51,910
Supercharges okay.
Because it doesn't take away from the 

2896
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:51,910
sound.
It adds a little extra sound,

2897
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:51,910
lads,
a little wine.

2898
02:21:53,020 --> 02:21:56,780
It adds that little shit.
Little fucking robo cop to the va.

2899
02:21:56,840 --> 02:22:00,200
It actually is kind of cool.
But a turbo charge is a real problem.

2900
02:22:00,201 --> 02:22:02,290
And turbo charges,
they get the full.

2901
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:04,640
Well the men,
the legs sort of have.

2902
02:22:04,641 --> 02:22:07,880
They got rid of barely noticeable now 
because they have twin turbos.

2903
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,850
So like a car,
like the nissan gtr or the nine slash 11

2904
02:22:10,851 --> 02:22:13,850
turbo,
barely noticeable in less.

2905
02:22:13,970 --> 02:22:16,880
You'd geT ahold of a gt three if you get
a hold of the gt three,

2906
02:22:16,881 --> 02:22:18,920
that's the race card.
They allow you to drive in the street.

2907
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:23,120
That car is totally naturally aspirated.
So my car revs up,

2908
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:26,910
I have a gt three rs and it revs up to 
8,800

2909
02:22:26,911 --> 02:22:28,440
rpm.
So it's like,

2910
02:22:28,441 --> 02:22:31,840
whoa.
As it's going up like that,

2911
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:38,320
that's um,
that's the gt three minds at gt three 

2912
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:39,120
rs.
If you google gt three rs,

2913
02:22:39,121 --> 02:22:42,480
shark works.
I have a one that I sent to this company

2914
02:22:42,481 --> 02:22:47,481
in northern content.
We've got like a gt three rs and then 

2915
02:22:47,481 --> 02:22:47,580
I'm like,
it's not crazy thing.

2916
02:22:47,610 --> 02:22:52,610
You've got to put some more shadow to 
the baddest motherfuckers porsche 

2917
02:22:52,610 --> 02:22:56,270
aftermarket,
and then they take it and they changed 

2918
02:22:56,270 --> 02:22:56,270
the suspension.
Every bump it goes over.

2919
02:22:56,270 --> 02:22:57,390
It hurts my balls,
you know,

2920
02:22:57,960 --> 02:22:59,220
but I don't care.
It doesn't matter.

2921
02:22:59,221 --> 02:23:00,120
It's so loud.

2922
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:03,010
Tell you the,
the thing you did that I will always.

2923
02:23:03,011 --> 02:23:04,930
And I think I,
I'm curious,

2924
02:23:04,931 --> 02:23:07,630
I want to ask you this question.
How much,

2925
02:23:07,690 --> 02:23:09,430
uh,
I mean,

2926
02:23:09,431 --> 02:23:10,390
I think,
do you,

2927
02:23:10,630 --> 02:23:15,630
what's your opinion?
I think that the car you had built on 

2928
02:23:15,630 --> 02:23:16,540
rides the sick fish.
Yeah,

2929
02:23:16,660 --> 02:23:18,720
I think that thing.
I mean,

2930
02:23:18,730 --> 02:23:23,730
that's always stuck with me.
If you'd get that from a lot of car 

2931
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:23,730
guys.

2932
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:23,730
Yeah.
They love it,

2933
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:28,401
but I give them the reality of driviNg 
that car and driving that car for a few 

2934
02:23:28,401 --> 02:23:30,990
years.
IT broke down so many fucking times,

2935
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:35,730
and I'm going to say this without being 
negative at all.

2936
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:40,790
There was a lot of issues in the 
construction of this car behind the 

2937
02:23:40,790 --> 02:23:44,301
scenes that allowed me to see things 
that I didn't know about the car world 

2938
02:23:46,021 --> 02:23:48,630
that mirrored the world of construction 
of homes,

2939
02:23:48,880 --> 02:23:53,880
mirrored the world.
There's a lot of fuckery that goes on 

2940
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:55,740
and and unfortunately,
and there's the guys who made it,

2941
02:23:55,790 --> 02:23:58,130
what chip foose designed it and troy 
Japan,

2942
02:23:58,131 --> 02:23:59,640
they built it.
They did a great fucking job,

2943
02:23:59,641 --> 02:24:04,641
but there's a bunch of other people 
involved in these transactions that you 

2944
02:24:04,641 --> 02:24:08,511
have to deal with it or not just 
unpleasant but unpleasant to the point 

2945
02:24:08,511 --> 02:24:12,351
where they inspiring murderous thoughts 
and I had to deal with these people to 

2946
02:24:12,351 --> 02:24:16,311
the point where I had to get on the 
phone and raise my voice and I don't 

2947
02:24:16,311 --> 02:24:16,311
like doing that.

2948
02:24:16,311 --> 02:24:17,100
And so There was a weirdness attached to
that car.

2949
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:19,800
And then there was the fact they didn't 
do what I wanted them to do.

2950
02:24:19,801 --> 02:24:21,690
I wanted them to make a car that I can 
drive.

2951
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:23,460
You know,
I wanted a car that,

2952
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:26,190
you know,
they had a car that they did on the show

2953
02:24:26,191 --> 02:24:31,191
was called rides.
They had a 67 fastback mustang they 

2954
02:24:31,191 --> 02:24:35,121
built that was fucking beautiful and it 
was a normal lifted suspension,

2955
02:24:35,941 --> 02:24:40,941
normal,
normal height off the ground so you can 

2956
02:24:40,941 --> 02:24:40,941
drive it around.
That's what I wanted to do.

2957
02:24:40,941 --> 02:24:44,281
I wonder the muscle car to drive around 
and they made me this lower chop thing 

2958
02:24:44,281 --> 02:24:47,500
with giant wheels and super complicated 
and show tricks.

2959
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Total show car,
and I was driving into the comedy store 

2960
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:53,000
every weekend.
I didn't give a fuck.

2961
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:54,870
This thing was not doing well.
It would leave me stranded.

2962
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:58,470
It left me stranded several times and 
more scary than that.

2963
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:03,500
One day I came home,
I pulled into my driveway and I'm 

2964
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:05,670
turning to get into the garage and my 
car bank leans to the side.

2965
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:07,050
This is,
this is it right here.

2966
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:10,440
This is what one of the few days where I
pulled it into the comedy store.

2967
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,740
It's a beautiful car.
I still love it,

2968
02:25:13,741 --> 02:25:16,090
man.
To this day I kind of miss it.

2969
02:25:16,310 --> 02:25:19,590
I like the fact that you didn't fall 
into the foods to tone trap.

2970
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:24,740
Yeah.
That mother fucker tried to turn my car 

2971
02:25:24,740 --> 02:25:24,740
into a spanish hooker.
That's just not happening.

2972
02:25:24,740 --> 02:25:26,380
Dog.
I love silver.

2973
02:25:26,381 --> 02:25:28,060
that's silver.
Color is beautiful.

2974
02:25:28,061 --> 02:25:31,240
It's so gorgeous and it accentuates the 
shape of the car.

2975
02:25:31,900 --> 02:25:36,900
So I pulled into my driveway and all the
sudden the car leans to the left,

2976
02:25:37,571 --> 02:25:40,990
like clunk and I get out and I look in 
the wheel.

2977
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:46,200
Has the suspension,
is separated from the frame and the 

2978
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:47,230
weirdest wheel is going sideways into 
the fender.

2979
02:25:47,230 --> 02:25:49,540
The fender is bent.
HoLy shit.

2980
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:51,460
And I'm like,
I was just on the highway.

2981
02:25:51,580 --> 02:25:52,150
Right,
right,

2982
02:25:52,151 --> 02:25:53,410
right.
I was on the highway,

2983
02:25:53,411 --> 02:25:57,430
I was going 70 miles an hour.
We'll could've fell off easily.

2984
02:25:57,460 --> 02:25:59,230
I would have been dead.
I had a,

2985
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:02,200
I had a three point harness and a have a
roll cage.

2986
02:26:02,290 --> 02:26:04,180
So maybe I'm exaggerating.
I might not be dead,

2987
02:26:04,181 --> 02:26:06,730
but I might be concussed.
I might've been fucked up.

2988
02:26:06,731 --> 02:26:08,710
I mean,
who knows when it could have happened,

2989
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:11,500
it could have been run over by a semi.
Anything could have happened.

2990
02:26:11,650 --> 02:26:16,650
And so I brought it to this guy in simi 
valley and uh,

2991
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:22,260
I had mr steve troop and I had him.
I'm just put the best possible 

2992
02:26:22,751 --> 02:26:24,730
suspension on it.
Fix it up,

2993
02:26:24,940 --> 02:26:27,430
make it cut all the bullshit.
What they fuck up,

2994
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:29,020
fix that.
Raise it a little.

2995
02:26:29,110 --> 02:26:30,450
Keeps bottoming out,
you know,

2996
02:26:30,490 --> 02:26:31,360
like,
find out.

2997
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:34,120
Find out why these bolts separated from 
the suspension,

2998
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:36,190
but they figured out something just 
break.

2999
02:26:36,220 --> 02:26:37,480
It was too low.
It was too low.

3000
02:26:37,481 --> 02:26:39,160
Is bottoming out.
It was so loud.

3001
02:26:39,161 --> 02:26:40,720
I couldn't hear when it was bottoming 
out.

3002
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:45,670
It was the most ridiculously rugged ride
in the history of automobiles.

3003
02:26:45,671 --> 02:26:50,671
It was about.
The sound was so loud.

3004
02:26:52,211 --> 02:26:52,900
It was.
What was,

3005
02:26:52,901 --> 02:26:54,130
what was in it?
What kind of motor?

3006
02:26:54,490 --> 02:26:58,200
A five slash 28 hemi.
I believe it was a five slash 28,

3007
02:26:58,201 --> 02:26:58,900
I believe that was.
It was,

3008
02:26:58,901 --> 02:27:01,090
uh,
it was an engine from a truck or a crate

3009
02:27:01,091 --> 02:27:06,091
engine.
Jesus wasn't even an engine that was 

3010
02:27:06,091 --> 02:27:06,091
ever offered.
I remember watching that thing.

3011
02:27:06,091 --> 02:27:07,750
And how long ago was that?
Man?

3012
02:27:07,751 --> 02:27:11,170
That was a long time ago.
It was like 2004 or something like that.

3013
02:27:11,171 --> 02:27:16,171
But I remember that.
I remember that show and I remember 

3014
02:27:16,171 --> 02:27:16,720
watching that and seeing the crowd,
man,

3015
02:27:16,721 --> 02:27:19,420
that's,
that's the sweetest fucking looking,

3016
02:27:19,990 --> 02:27:21,040
but here's the deal,
man.

3017
02:27:21,610 --> 02:27:22,930
That's,
that's the gts,

3018
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:26,650
but not a four point zero.
Put up a gts shark.

3019
02:27:26,651 --> 02:27:30,010
Works kermit if you find kermit my 
friend alex,

3020
02:27:30,011 --> 02:27:35,011
as he used to be his car.
He's the one who buIlt my car and he 

3021
02:27:35,011 --> 02:27:35,370
made thIs car called the kermit,
but he.

3022
02:27:35,410 --> 02:27:40,410
He had to wind up selling it.
Somebody just came with too much cash 

3023
02:27:40,410 --> 02:27:41,080
because what they do is they take the 
gts rs,

3024
02:27:41,081 --> 02:27:43,480
which is rennsport.
Rennsport is the most,

3025
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:47,440
the most race ready version of the 
porsche.

3026
02:27:47,441 --> 02:27:52,441
Nine 11.
They cut out the backseats to cut all 

3027
02:27:52,441 --> 02:27:54,691
the weight.
They lower the sound deadening so that 

3028
02:27:54,691 --> 02:27:54,691
the cage in it.
Yeah.

3029
02:27:54,691 --> 02:27:54,691
Yeah.
Mine does.

3030
02:27:54,691 --> 02:27:57,310
And that's what his looks like.
mine's outside.

3031
02:27:57,311 --> 02:27:58,840
I'll show it to you after the.
That's a.

3032
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:01,810
That's the green one that he had and 
that car is,

3033
02:28:02,130 --> 02:28:03,880
you know,
502 horsepower,

3034
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:07,350
2,900
pounds and just fucking fool.

3035
02:28:09,890 --> 02:28:14,560
And not just the flies,
but it's like it's glued to the ground.

3036
02:28:14,561 --> 02:28:17,650
It's got this feel that it gives you,
when you hIt corners.

3037
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:21,350
I even if I'm going 30 miles an hour,
I love the way it feels.

3038
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:24,230
It feels like an athlete.
it feels like,

3039
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:29,260
you know,
every other car is capable and if you 

3040
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:29,260
do,
that's all you're looking for.

3041
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:30,050
You're looking for something that gets 
you from point a to point b.

3042
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:32,510
I'm not judging you.
I'm not,

3043
02:28:32,511 --> 02:28:35,570
I'm not,
but it doesn't take away.

3044
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:40,720
There's some people like everybody has 
to like what they like and if you don't 

3045
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:40,720
like what they liked something wrong 
with you.

3046
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:43,060
You're an asshole.
You're a fucking homophobe.

3047
02:28:43,061 --> 02:28:46,460
You like va.
It's everybody's got to be outraged.

3048
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:48,180
Yeah.
They got to find something that

3049
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:51,280
they like that you don't or you liked 
that they don't,

3050
02:28:51,281 --> 02:28:53,320
so they don't like what they like.
You're a dick.

3051
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:55,720
People are fucking crazy.
But for me,

3052
02:28:56,250 --> 02:29:00,130
I am.
I am madly in love with engineering.

3053
02:29:00,370 --> 02:29:05,370
I'm madly in love with the craftsmanship
involved and building an engine and the,

3054
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:08,170
the,
just the feeling of turning the key.

3055
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:08,570
What?
Boom.

3056
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:10,690
Boom.
F one at all.

3057
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:13,130
Yes.
I love dario french.

3058
02:29:13,131 --> 02:29:16,450
Chetty take a different.
To the fucking wall there.

3059
02:29:16,451 --> 02:29:18,010
That was that.
No,

3060
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:20,980
that was a big step one.
Yeah.

3061
02:29:21,010 --> 02:29:21,580
Let me,
uh,

3062
02:29:21,610 --> 02:29:22,630
dario.
No,

3063
02:29:22,631 --> 02:29:23,470
it wasn't.
You're right.

3064
02:29:23,471 --> 02:29:25,610
I guess he wasn't lamonds was it?
Indeed,

3065
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:26,650
right?
It was indy.

3066
02:29:30,430 --> 02:29:32,710
Yes.
He was released from the hospital.

3067
02:29:33,070 --> 02:29:35,600
He's got that guy got an incredible car.
Well that's.

3068
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:37,690
He's got a series of cars,
but he's got a 19,

3069
02:29:37,691 --> 02:29:42,691
73 porsche that he had rebuIlt and put 
modern suspension on it.

3070
02:29:44,050 --> 02:29:47,170
A 350 horsepower engine.
It's like a hot rod.

3071
02:29:47,171 --> 02:29:50,840
Porsche is his name is dario french 
chetty friend.

3072
02:29:50,841 --> 02:29:53,410
Chitty for c h I t,
t,

3073
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:56,280
t dot.
She's still married to a no son.

3074
02:29:56,580 --> 02:29:58,960
Free at last.
Free at last.

3075
02:29:58,961 --> 02:30:01,300
Thank god almighty.
You know him?

3076
02:30:01,570 --> 02:30:03,190
No.
He was married to an actress though.

3077
02:30:03,191 --> 02:30:06,270
But I can only assume that it's better 
for everyone.

3078
02:30:06,890 --> 02:30:09,510
This is him crashing.
Yeah.

3079
02:30:09,530 --> 02:30:11,810
Look at this.
He got launched into the fucking cage.

3080
02:30:11,870 --> 02:30:16,870
Jesus christ.
I lived in indianapolis and broke his 

3081
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:18,710
neck.
That was the indy 500 obviously.

3082
02:30:19,130 --> 02:30:20,600
But it's interesting to me that,
uh,

3083
02:30:20,650 --> 02:30:25,650
the most of the f one drivers won't race
indy because they say it's too fucking 

3084
02:30:26,841 --> 02:30:28,160
dangerous.
Well,

3085
02:30:28,161 --> 02:30:29,700
it makes sense because,
you know,

3086
02:30:29,820 --> 02:30:32,270
an f one,
they have long straights and every,

3087
02:30:32,310 --> 02:30:34,060
you know,
every once in a while.

3088
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:35,410
Um,
god,

3089
02:30:35,480 --> 02:30:38,900
what's the dude's name?
It'll come to me.

3090
02:30:39,230 --> 02:30:39,730
But,
uh,

3091
02:30:39,810 --> 02:30:42,680
anyway,
very rarely do guys get killed.

3092
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:44,870
Pull up his car.
Dario french,

3093
02:30:44,871 --> 02:30:45,900
eddie hot rod.
Porsche.

3094
02:30:46,480 --> 02:30:50,570
A rarely do guys get killed in f one.
I mean it's happened,

3095
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:53,210
but it's pretty rare.
Um,

3096
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:58,160
but in indy they're going 200 plus miles
an hour in an oval.

3097
02:30:58,660 --> 02:31:03,660
In f one,
they've got turns and shit like that to 

3098
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:03,660
keep them slowed down.

3099
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:04,850
But uh,
that ferrari.

3100
02:31:05,090 --> 02:31:06,170
No,
that's a porsche.

3101
02:31:06,171 --> 02:31:09,680
That's a porsche gt.
It's a carerra gt,

3102
02:31:09,681 --> 02:31:11,070
but that's not as car.
I'll tell you,

3103
02:31:11,071 --> 02:31:13,700
she's got a 19,
73 porsche hot rod.

3104
02:31:13,730 --> 02:31:15,170
Dario.
Just google that.

3105
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:17,510
Tell you some shit you ought to check 
out man.

3106
02:31:17,511 --> 02:31:19,290
And I'm not,
I'm not a biker.

3107
02:31:19,291 --> 02:31:22,080
I'm not a motorcycle guy.
I'm not,

3108
02:31:22,140 --> 02:31:24,630
not in any way shape,
form or fashion,

3109
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:29,990
but something that absolutely fascinates
the shit out of me is the isle of man 

3110
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:31,110
tt.
What's that?

3111
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:33,300
Oh,
you got.

3112
02:31:33,690 --> 02:31:36,120
Oh fuck.
I can't visit the island man.

3113
02:31:36,121 --> 02:31:39,150
Tt is a race has been going on for a 
long time.

3114
02:31:39,210 --> 02:31:41,460
You know what the isle of man is.
Okay.

3115
02:31:41,980 --> 02:31:46,320
We'll tell people that don't know that I
love man is a little tiny ass island off

3116
02:31:46,321 --> 02:31:51,321
the coast of england.
And what they do is tee tee stands for 

3117
02:31:51,321 --> 02:31:54,180
tourist trophy and it's been going on 
for,

3118
02:31:54,181 --> 02:31:56,790
I want to say like a hundred years close
to it.

3119
02:31:57,330 --> 02:32:02,330
But uh,
they shut down the roads on the island 

3120
02:32:02,330 --> 02:32:04,140
and they have a race course that's like 
16,

3121
02:32:04,141 --> 02:32:09,141
18 miles,
something like that all throughout the 

3122
02:32:09,141 --> 02:32:09,210
island.
But it's motorcycles.

3123
02:32:09,330 --> 02:32:14,330
It's all bikes and it's one of the only 
places where these guys can go balls out

3124
02:32:17,220 --> 02:32:19,830
on real streets.
Um,

3125
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:24,270
I'll tell you how dangerous it is.
That used to be,

3126
02:32:24,271 --> 02:32:27,630
I think in the seventies,
they took it off the circuit at one time

3127
02:32:27,631 --> 02:32:32,631
it was on the circuit of like 
internationally recognized races and 

3128
02:32:32,631 --> 02:32:34,230
they took it off because it was too 
dangerous.

3129
02:32:34,231 --> 02:32:37,230
Too many people were dyIng over the 
history of the race.

3130
02:32:37,231 --> 02:32:42,231
They average one to two people a year 
die that race and it's.

3131
02:32:42,750 --> 02:32:47,750
There's,
I can't remember the name of the 

3132
02:32:47,750 --> 02:32:49,101
documentary on it.
Just just google isle of man tt and 

3133
02:32:49,101 --> 02:32:51,150
watch some of the footage and these guys
here.

3134
02:32:51,740 --> 02:32:52,530
It's crazy.

3135
02:32:52,530 --> 02:32:54,090
It's sick.
These are streets.

3136
02:32:54,091 --> 02:32:58,110
There's no barriers.
There's no runoff areas.

3137
02:32:58,530 --> 02:32:59,550
Nothing.
Look at this.

3138
02:33:00,070 --> 02:33:04,080
I mean these guys are going 150,
180 miles an hour.

3139
02:33:05,250 --> 02:33:10,250
How does everybody know?
Do they make sure that everybody knows 

3140
02:33:10,250 --> 02:33:12,900
diet deal look like this is through the 
mountains and shit and they're racing?

3141
02:33:12,930 --> 02:33:13,920
Yeah.
Oh my god.

3142
02:33:13,950 --> 02:33:18,950
How many people die one to two a year.
There's been over 200 dead since the 

3143
02:33:19,050 --> 02:33:20,140
race began.
Oh my.

3144
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:23,250
Yeah.
No,

3145
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:26,100
but I mean look at this,
but what is this?

3146
02:33:26,101 --> 02:33:27,930
Because europeans are just used to 
death.

3147
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:30,900
You know,
they have a long history of guys.

3148
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:35,640
The guys who run this race,
like you have a.

3149
02:33:36,330 --> 02:33:40,590
What's the shit?
What's the motogp moto gp,

3150
02:33:40,591 --> 02:33:44,760
which is like f one for motorcycles.
But these guys,

3151
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:50,030
uh,
those guys don't fuck with this because 

3152
02:33:50,030 --> 02:33:50,690
it's too dangerous.
Yeah.

3153
02:33:50,790 --> 02:33:52,680
So who's doing this?
The craziest of the crazy.

3154
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:57,710
Pretty much.
Look at these motherfuckers popping 

3155
02:33:57,710 --> 02:33:58,200
wheelies and look at the fucking camera 
view.

3156
02:33:58,220 --> 02:33:59,340
This dude,
what is it?

3157
02:33:59,430 --> 02:34:01,960
Was it with the speed side?
They're one slash 70.

3158
02:34:02,430 --> 02:34:04,260
Oh,
jesus.

3159
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:09,210
Fucking the wheeziness one 70 with just 
raw body.

3160
02:34:09,211 --> 02:34:14,211
So anytime you fall you're dead.
You die 100 percent or you get really 

3161
02:34:14,211 --> 02:34:19,011
fucked up forever.
It was a great documentary for the life 

3162
02:34:19,011 --> 02:34:19,011
of me.
I,

3163
02:34:19,011 --> 02:34:23,480
I'll,
I need to google it and give you the 

3164
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:25,441
name of it.
I'm terrible with like little details 

3165
02:34:25,441 --> 02:34:26,080
and shit.
Fucking camera on this car.

3166
02:34:26,081 --> 02:34:29,130
This is when I'm on bike.
Yeah,

3167
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:32,290
that's a like a 300 pound motorcycle.
But look at the camera,

3168
02:34:32,291 --> 02:34:34,620
like when you see like what he seen.
It's,

3169
02:34:35,170 --> 02:34:36,700
it's a blur.
That's what's crazy.

3170
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:41,730
I mean,
and where they get fucked up is 

3171
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:41,860
everywhere else.
Like there's a,

3172
02:34:42,190 --> 02:34:47,190
there's a somewhere if online there's 
like a greatest hits video of the 

3173
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:51,961
wrecks,
and you remember that one scene where 

3174
02:34:51,961 --> 02:34:54,550
they're going through the green fields,
the beautiful emerald fields,

3175
02:34:54,820 --> 02:34:57,460
and there's like a sloping turn that 
goes to the right.

3176
02:34:57,940 --> 02:34:59,950
Something fucked up.
Guy just goes straight.

3177
02:35:00,010 --> 02:35:02,140
Oh,
jesus just flies.

3178
02:35:02,380 --> 02:35:04,330
Oh my god.
And he's dead.

3179
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:10,140
I mean,
it's like as soon as he went off the 

3180
02:35:10,140 --> 02:35:10,140
road,
he was dead.

3181
02:35:10,140 --> 02:35:13,920
Did you ever took him about 20 seconds 
before he hit 20 seconds?

3182
02:35:15,270 --> 02:35:20,270
Think about 20 seconds.
That's probably why it's probably an 

3183
02:35:20,270 --> 02:35:20,620
overestimation,
but five,

3184
02:35:20,650 --> 02:35:22,060
even five.
One,

3185
02:35:22,061 --> 02:35:23,320
one,
two,

3186
02:35:23,321 --> 02:35:25,930
1003,
1004,

3187
02:35:25,931 --> 02:35:28,100
1005.
Uh,

3188
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:29,530
you gotta,
you gotta think,

3189
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:31,780
you know,
the only worse thing I could think about

3190
02:35:31,781 --> 02:35:33,700
going like that.
Tiger's nope.

3191
02:35:33,830 --> 02:35:35,470
Uh,
the fucking nailed.

3192
02:35:35,480 --> 02:35:37,030
You see the 7:47
crash?

3193
02:35:37,031 --> 02:35:38,680
Yes.
That would fucking suck.

3194
02:35:38,681 --> 02:35:40,270
That would suck.
That would suck.

3195
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:43,270
Being in the cockpit here in those 
chains,

3196
02:35:43,271 --> 02:35:48,190
break the fucking cargo shifts to the 
rear and you're like,

3197
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:50,980
fuck,
that's a wrap.

3198
02:35:51,070 --> 02:35:56,070
You know you're going to die.
How much cargo is in there that made it 

3199
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,890
snap like that?
I don't know if I'm making this up,

3200
02:35:56,891 --> 02:36:01,891
but I want to say I heard him wraps 
amwraps was that mean mine resistant 

3201
02:36:01,891 --> 02:36:03,430
armored personnel carriers,
jews.

3202
02:36:03,450 --> 02:36:06,580
There were the giant asked.
They're the things that kind of replaced

3203
02:36:06,581 --> 02:36:08,260
the humvees.
Oh jesus.

3204
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:09,550
That's.
That makes sense.

3205
02:36:09,551 --> 02:36:13,720
That the mass and how it was just 
impossible to navigate.

3206
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:17,050
If you've never seen that video before.
It was a video taken in Afghanistan.

3207
02:36:17,051 --> 02:36:22,051
Have a 7:47
that it's taking off and then somewhere 

3208
02:36:22,051 --> 02:36:24,100
in the flight right after takeoff 
basically.

3209
02:36:24,101 --> 02:36:29,101
Yeah.
The chains break the weight shifts and 

3210
02:36:29,101 --> 02:36:29,380
it comes crashing directly and it's 
like,

3211
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:32,830
it just stops in midair.
It's so weird and then it just falls.

3212
02:36:33,010 --> 02:36:36,520
It's one of the it.
It's one of the things about having,

3213
02:36:36,521 --> 02:36:38,500
you know,
dashboard jeep,

3214
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:40,120
a dashboard.
Cameras.

3215
02:36:40,210 --> 02:36:41,590
Here it is right here.
See,

3216
02:36:41,630 --> 02:36:43,250
they're freaks me out.
Every policy.

3217
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:45,040
Insane.
It's flying.

3218
02:36:45,041 --> 02:36:50,041
It's crazy.
Is the dude who's taping this that I 

3219
02:36:50,041 --> 02:36:53,251
want to say it was a us soldier,
but he doesn't say a word during this 

3220
02:36:53,251 --> 02:36:53,251
time.
It doesn't say shit.

3221
02:36:53,251 --> 02:36:55,210
Rob's down and you see it,
and at this point in time,

3222
02:36:55,211 --> 02:36:55,970
you know,
you're like,

3223
02:36:55,990 --> 02:36:58,360
oh my god,
boom,

3224
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:02,680
drops down.
Have you ever seen the dance so insane.

3225
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:04,750
Play that again.
Please change after this.

3226
02:37:04,751 --> 02:37:07,060
I got another great aircraft crashed for
you.

3227
02:37:07,450 --> 02:37:08,800
Look at this.
Look at this.

3228
02:37:08,801 --> 02:37:10,980
Imagine being that bus.
Yeah,

3229
02:37:11,020 --> 02:37:16,020
like fuck.
And that's what's the dude who's taping

3230
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:16,820
it?
He had the heart.

3231
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:18,320
You can hear the audio because it's 
ambient.

3232
02:37:18,321 --> 02:37:21,860
It doesn't say a fucking word.
How used to trauma is this gentleman,

3233
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:26,920
I don't know,
but I mean I would be freaking the fuck 

3234
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:26,920
out.
Well,

3235
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:29,760
that's one of the biggest issues about 
these wars is bringing these young 

3236
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:34,721
people home and giving them no tools to 
deal with the kind of trauma that 

3237
02:37:34,721 --> 02:37:39,251
they've seen and the reality that 
they've experienced and how much 

3238
02:37:39,251 --> 02:37:42,071
different that reality is.
then the reality of me or of a normal 

3239
02:37:42,071 --> 02:37:45,911
person who has not gone to war,
you're dealing with a totally different 

3240
02:37:45,911 --> 02:37:49,391
type of human with completely different 
rewiring the possibilities of reality 

3241
02:37:49,700 --> 02:37:51,920
and what's fucked up is this country has
done it.

3242
02:37:52,290 --> 02:37:55,620
Every war they've ever had to do it 
until somebody,

3243
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:59,150
they can't do it.
18 world war one,

3244
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:01,910
world war.
I mean it's 2000.

3245
02:38:01,910 --> 02:38:06,910
Twenty seven is going to be our robots 
kIlled your robots do you give up and 

3246
02:38:06,910 --> 02:38:07,160
you know.
And that's,

3247
02:38:07,490 --> 02:38:09,260
that's one of the things about the 
drone.

3248
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:13,490
I'm fascinated with the drone drones 
versus drones.

3249
02:38:13,491 --> 02:38:18,491
Robots.
I don't ever think it will be drones 

3250
02:38:18,491 --> 02:38:18,491
versus drones.
Uh,

3251
02:38:18,491 --> 02:38:19,510
maybe it will.
I don't know what.

3252
02:38:19,511 --> 02:38:22,100
That's when it starts getting 
interesting now it sucks.

3253
02:38:22,101 --> 02:38:24,080
Well,
what's scary is drones versus humans.

3254
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:25,790
It's not fair.
It makes it too easy.

3255
02:38:26,030 --> 02:38:31,030
It's like trannies.
It's like a male transvestite 

3256
02:38:31,030 --> 02:38:31,840
transsexual fighting against female 
trans.

3257
02:38:31,841 --> 02:38:32,870
oh yeah,
you got me.

3258
02:38:32,950 --> 02:38:33,770
Yeah,
I agree.

3259
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:38,860
That's an issue.
There's a lot of people in the 

3260
02:38:38,860 --> 02:38:39,020
transvestite transgender community that 
believed that,

3261
02:38:39,021 --> 02:38:44,021
uh,
I'm a transphobia because I made some 

3262
02:38:44,021 --> 02:38:44,021
comments about a woman who used to be a 
man.

3263
02:38:44,060 --> 02:38:46,310
I have nothing but love for that woman 
that used to be a man.

3264
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:48,050
I got nothing but love for anybody.

3265
02:38:48,350 --> 02:38:53,350
But I am coming at anything to 
completely from the point of fairness 

3266
02:38:54,051 --> 02:38:55,730
when it comes to combat sports.
Sure,

3267
02:38:55,770 --> 02:39:00,770
that's it.
I could give zero fucks if you want to 

3268
02:39:00,770 --> 02:39:01,970
be a man,
if he would rather be a woman.

3269
02:39:02,180 --> 02:39:05,230
There was a,
there was a navy seal that was.

3270
02:39:05,350 --> 02:39:05,980
There was.
Well,

3271
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:08,930
there was a.
I wrote a book recently.

3272
02:39:09,020 --> 02:39:11,200
Yes.
A warrior princess princess.

3273
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:12,440
Yes.
Brian cowen,

3274
02:39:12,470 --> 02:39:17,470
my boy.
He interviewed one of his podcasts or 

3275
02:39:17,470 --> 02:39:17,840
her on his podcast.
I'm full.

3276
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:19,190
How do you,
you know,

3277
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:24,280
I'm asked,
I'm asked pro gender equality as I am 

3278
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:27,581
pro gun control or pro gun ownership 
should say I should usually be able to 

3279
02:39:27,581 --> 02:39:29,060
do whatever the fuck you want and that's
where I'm at.

3280
02:39:29,450 --> 02:39:31,200
And the other thing too,
especially with,

3281
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:34,160
with a person like that man woman,
I don't know what the proper,

3282
02:39:34,670 --> 02:39:38,600
it's a woman wants the trends,
but that's how I would accept that.

3283
02:39:38,690 --> 02:39:42,110
Any person who who served their nation 
in that capacity,

3284
02:39:42,530 --> 02:39:45,470
I mean any person she can do whatever 
the fuck they want,

3285
02:39:45,830 --> 02:39:48,320
but the fact of it is that they got your
back.

3286
02:39:48,340 --> 02:39:49,040
Yeah,
absolutely.

3287
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:51,860
They have my respect as well and you 
know what man,

3288
02:39:51,910 --> 02:39:56,780
at any kid who grows up that is growing 
up as a boy but wishes he was a girl,

3289
02:39:57,020 --> 02:39:58,910
they have my respect to,
you know,

3290
02:39:58,911 --> 02:40:03,911
and there's a lot of people in the 
transgender community that have been 

3291
02:40:03,911 --> 02:40:03,911
upset at me about this,
this,

3292
02:40:03,911 --> 02:40:07,030
this issue about this mma fighter,
but me,

3293
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:09,870
it has nothing to do with anything 
except combat sports.

3294
02:40:09,871 --> 02:40:13,200
That's to me is a legit issue because 
You're talking about,

3295
02:40:13,201 --> 02:40:14,100
I'm sorry,
but

3296
02:40:14,580 --> 02:40:16,680
this thing is not like the other.
Well

3297
02:40:16,860 --> 02:40:19,680
I know whY I know it because of the day.
It really isn't.

3298
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:23,820
Well there's not equal.
There's variations inside the male frame

3299
02:40:23,821 --> 02:40:24,960
as well,
you know,

3300
02:40:24,990 --> 02:40:29,990
and I have experienced tremendous 
benefits from being on the fortunate 

3301
02:40:29,990 --> 02:40:34,971
side of certain genetics.
Like I have man hands a big fat stupid 

3302
02:40:34,971 --> 02:40:38,730
man hands and if you put a woman in a 
dress and if she had these manhattan's,

3303
02:40:38,820 --> 02:40:40,740
she'd be a dangerous bitch.
That's,

3304
02:40:40,741 --> 02:40:44,130
that's not fair.
It's not fair that the male frame is not

3305
02:40:44,131 --> 02:40:44,720
fair.
The,

3306
02:40:44,721 --> 02:40:48,630
the male hips are different.
Renee richards sucked as a man,

3307
02:40:48,631 --> 02:40:52,770
as a tennis player.
But dominated bitches as a woman,

3308
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:53,940
you know,
and that's,

3309
02:40:54,320 --> 02:40:55,100
it's,
it's just,

3310
02:40:55,200 --> 02:41:00,200
it's a matter of competition and I don't
have any problem with that competition 

3311
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:02,140
when it comes to anything involving 
anything other than physical damage.

3312
02:41:02,260 --> 02:41:05,160
Don't get to beat somebody up.
Exactly my,

3313
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:10,340
if it was baseball and all of a sudden 
this girl who used to be a guy's now 

3314
02:41:10,340 --> 02:41:10,890
awesome at baseball.
Tough shit.

3315
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:12,420
Get better at baseball.
You know,

3316
02:41:12,470 --> 02:41:12,770
the,
the,

3317
02:41:12,771 --> 02:41:17,771
the interesting thing about transgenders
when it comes to non combat sports as 

3318
02:41:17,771 --> 02:41:19,470
they've never achieved world 
championship status.

3319
02:41:19,530 --> 02:41:24,530
Sure.
Like the most famous is renee richards 

3320
02:41:24,530 --> 02:41:27,650
who became like 20th in the nation as 
top level as a professional tennis 

3321
02:41:27,661 --> 02:41:32,661
player.
That means that a dude who used to be a 

3322
02:41:32,661 --> 02:41:34,160
dude who became a woman,
okay.

3323
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:38,070
Becomes a woman,
is a woman now still can't be the best

3324
02:41:39,030 --> 02:41:44,030
how double x chromosome women.
Because to me it goes back to what we 

3325
02:41:44,341 --> 02:41:49,341
talked about excellence at at any level,
no matter what you know.

3326
02:41:49,860 --> 02:41:54,860
So you're saying that if you had 
excellence you would accept the natural 

3327
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:54,860
born gender that you're born with?
No,

3328
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:54,860
no,
no.

3329
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:55,620
What I'm saying.
And sexual identities,

3330
02:41:55,621 --> 02:42:00,621
or just in your mind saying,
is a genetic strength advantage cannot 

3331
02:42:00,621 --> 02:42:04,821
overcome someone who has the drive and 
willingness to be great.

3332
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:08,040
That's all good on paper.
It can and it can't.

3333
02:42:08,310 --> 02:42:09,810
It depends on what the,
what the,

3334
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:10,740
what the.
Um,

3335
02:42:10,770 --> 02:42:13,170
you take a per.
Here's a perfect example.

3336
02:42:13,380 --> 02:42:17,880
You take a mediocre run of the mill.
Male pro.

3337
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:19,770
Okay.
Okay.

3338
02:42:20,330 --> 02:42:25,330
Actually this is probably a bad example 
because there's a pretty big disparity 

3339
02:42:25,330 --> 02:42:29,000
in pool between men and women players,
which is crazy because there shouldn't 

3340
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:29,000
be.
That's why I needed to.

3341
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,980
Do I need to get on the woman's pro tour
started tom robbing people.

3342
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:37,520
Tell me,
can I place top 10 pro tour guarantee 

3343
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:40,400
you could place top 20 dad is amazing.
GuaranTee you could pay.

3344
02:42:40,450 --> 02:42:42,270
That's a professional.
Woman's guaranteed.

3345
02:42:42,460 --> 02:42:44,850
Fisher would always rob.
I guarantee you can place top 20,

3346
02:42:44,851 --> 02:42:48,840
but the top five would be nice to you.
But for now,

3347
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:53,960
for now the iconic but a.
If you had to get beat and he got beat 

3348
02:42:53,960 --> 02:42:55,110
by guy young kim,
there's a lot worse things.

3349
02:42:55,111 --> 02:42:57,420
There's a lot worse things in life to go
home and sleep,

3350
02:42:57,421 --> 02:43:00,930
to contemplate before you sleep,
meditate before you sleep.

3351
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:02,760
You say that,
but that's.

3352
02:43:02,761 --> 02:43:07,761
If I get crazy,
if I get crazy and I dedicated my life 

3353
02:43:07,761 --> 02:43:07,800
to that shit still too late.
I've got a deck.

3354
02:43:07,830 --> 02:43:09,600
They don't have a deck.
Feel good.

3355
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:11,340
Here's something.
I'm late late.

3356
02:43:11,341 --> 02:43:11,980
It was great.

3357
02:43:12,260 --> 02:43:17,260
It's too late.
unless you involve mushrooms in the 

3358
02:43:17,260 --> 02:43:17,260
equation,
it doesn't matter.

3359
02:43:17,260 --> 02:43:21,240
It doesn't prove you wrong.
Every great pool player I know was 

3360
02:43:21,311 --> 02:43:22,970
great.
by the time they were 21,

3361
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:25,030
they didn't do mushrooms.
If they did do mushrooms,

3362
02:43:25,031 --> 02:43:30,031
they would realize that you can have a 
rebirth in any point in time and then 

3363
02:43:30,031 --> 02:43:30,031
dedicate your site,
your site,

3364
02:43:30,031 --> 02:43:32,080
and how kelly on that goal though.
That's true.

3365
02:43:32,110 --> 02:43:34,060
There's no benefit.
If there was a benefit,

3366
02:43:34,420 --> 02:43:37,070
if there was some fucking money,
no,

3367
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:38,890
but if there was some fucking snooker 
money,

3368
02:43:39,970 --> 02:43:41,550
if there was some real snuck her money.
Man.

3369
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:44,460
Even snickers not smoker anymore.
No,

3370
02:43:44,461 --> 02:43:45,430
it's not a.
You know what?

3371
02:43:45,431 --> 02:43:49,210
Nothing's was.
No fucking nascar teams.

3372
02:43:49,450 --> 02:43:51,280
Presidents.
Do you want to know that?

3373
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:54,100
Ford motor company just dropped john 
force.

3374
02:43:54,160 --> 02:43:58,660
Now I'm not a drag race for us.
John force is the biggest name and nhr a

3375
02:43:58,661 --> 02:43:59,110
drag race.

3376
02:43:59,130 --> 02:44:00,340
Well,
he never reached me.

3377
02:44:00,430 --> 02:44:03,970
He never reached out to fuck hImself.
You,

3378
02:44:05,370 --> 02:44:08,320
I guarantee if I showed castrol you 
would see it.

3379
02:44:08,580 --> 02:44:10,930
It's got too hot ass daughters to drive 
to.

3380
02:44:11,800 --> 02:44:12,400
Come on,
man.

3381
02:44:12,430 --> 02:44:14,880
Don't tell electric all that.
I told you.

3382
02:44:14,890 --> 02:44:16,790
I like german cars.
Oh,

3383
02:44:16,791 --> 02:44:17,520
that's right.
You're.

3384
02:44:17,590 --> 02:44:20,190
You're that guy.
I like american cars.

3385
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:23,000
Ever built another hot rod.
we'd never build another outline.

3386
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:23,720
Yes,
I would.

3387
02:44:23,820 --> 02:44:27,640
they would have to be with a friend.
My issue with the building that car was.

3388
02:44:27,641 --> 02:44:29,830
I didn't know that.
Do that well and shit got squirrelly.

3389
02:44:29,860 --> 02:44:31,300
If you could build another car,
what would you buIld?

3390
02:44:32,260 --> 02:44:37,030
Sixty nine camaro or 69 mustang.
Those are my two.

3391
02:44:37,210 --> 02:44:39,400
There's something about the summer of 
love that created,

3392
02:44:39,401 --> 02:44:41,160
in my opinion,
the perfect cards,

3393
02:44:41,170 --> 02:44:44,680
except for mopars.
Mopars became perfect.

3394
02:44:44,681 --> 02:44:49,681
It's 70 to 69.
Barracuda cannot fuck with the 70 

3395
02:44:49,681 --> 02:44:50,620
barracuda or challenger.
Yeah.

3396
02:44:50,810 --> 02:44:52,660
There's something about the 19 
seventies,

3397
02:44:52,930 --> 02:44:56,830
69 mustangs and motherfucker too fast 
back.

3398
02:44:56,860 --> 02:44:57,910
Yes.
Oh,

3399
02:44:57,940 --> 02:45:01,130
it's about as good as my friend bud 
breath,

3400
02:45:01,131 --> 02:45:01,410
man.
He.

3401
02:45:01,440 --> 02:45:04,420
Do you ever drive and eleanor,
did you ever find that one?

3402
02:45:04,510 --> 02:45:09,510
No.
The real problem is that driving is 

3403
02:45:09,510 --> 02:45:13,261
really.
It's fun and it's interesting and 

3404
02:45:13,261 --> 02:45:13,410
you're,
you're,

3405
02:45:13,411 --> 02:45:13,840
you're,
you're,

3406
02:45:13,841 --> 02:45:15,610
you're hopping into a time machine.

3407
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:21,160
Twenty five minutes later,
you're done.

3408
02:45:21,640 --> 02:45:25,780
It smells like gas stinks.
He tried to take a corner of the fucking

3409
02:45:25,781 --> 02:45:30,781
ass and slides out on you the brakes to 
lock up and leave these big black 

3410
02:45:30,781 --> 02:45:32,970
patches when a fucking cat runs in front
of the road.

3411
02:45:32,980 --> 02:45:37,980
Meanwhile,
you've got this fucking ufo in the 

3412
02:45:37,980 --> 02:45:39,090
garage over what ruined me.
I had a nine,

3413
02:45:39,110 --> 02:45:39,930
nine,
six,

3414
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:42,930
2000,
three or 2004,

3415
02:45:42,940 --> 02:45:44,980
whatever it was,
nine slash 11 turbo.

3416
02:45:45,130 --> 02:45:50,130
That ruined me.
That mother fucker ruined me because it 

3417
02:45:50,130 --> 02:45:50,130
was,
it was four wheel drive.

3418
02:45:50,130 --> 02:45:54,810
It was zero to 60 in under four secoNds 
or he's the stupidest car I've ever had 

3419
02:45:54,810 --> 02:45:58,591
in my life and I had no idea that the 
physics of the movement that that car 

3420
02:45:58,591 --> 02:45:59,890
was capable of or possible.
Right?

3421
02:46:00,010 --> 02:46:05,010
So I would drive like a muscle car after
that and it had a beautiful feeling to 

3422
02:46:05,010 --> 02:46:06,340
it,
like the smell and The sound and the,

3423
02:46:06,590 --> 02:46:10,070
the analog steering and the shifting of 
your own gears.

3424
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:13,310
Like if you could get a standard.
My barracuda was actually an automatic,

3425
02:46:13,311 --> 02:46:14,840
which is one of the things I didn't like
about it.

3426
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:17,930
But you built a car and had an automatic
put in.

3427
02:46:17,960 --> 02:46:20,150
It was their idea.
I let them do everything.

3428
02:46:20,151 --> 02:46:25,151
That's how it all happens.
Your man card suspended or how'd that 

3429
02:46:25,151 --> 02:46:25,151
work?
Well,

3430
02:46:25,151 --> 02:46:25,880
it became.
I spent the money on it for sure,

3431
02:46:25,881 --> 02:46:29,750
but it was all them telling me I didn't 
know enough about the muscle car world.

3432
02:46:29,770 --> 02:46:32,240
Sure.
And so when I was having it built,

3433
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:37,360
I didn't know why the fuck did they put 
it on a mannequin it because the amount 

3434
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:40,451
of power the engine was 700 horsepower,
700 horsepower is an insane amount of 

3435
02:46:41,901 --> 02:46:46,901
money.
I mean it's an insane amount of power 

3436
02:46:46,901 --> 02:46:49,031
and money,
but it sounds like a fire breathing 

3437
02:46:49,031 --> 02:46:49,031
dragon.
I mean,

3438
02:46:49,031 --> 02:46:49,850
and he was saying that the clutch,
we just wouldn't handle it.

3439
02:46:49,980 --> 02:46:52,910
Sure.
It was just too much fucking a blower on

3440
02:46:52,911 --> 02:46:53,880
the motor.
yeah.

3441
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:54,740
Oh,
jesus.

3442
02:46:54,860 --> 02:46:56,480
Yeah.
It was ridiculous car.

3443
02:46:56,840 --> 02:46:59,690
It was ridiculous car.
Well actually we went up.

3444
02:46:59,691 --> 02:47:00,350
No,
no,

3445
02:47:00,370 --> 02:47:00,700
no,
no.

3446
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:05,710
I take that back.
We went up going with electronic fuel 

3447
02:47:05,710 --> 02:47:05,710
injection.
No blower.

3448
02:47:05,710 --> 02:47:06,620
When you have a 100 horsepower naturally
aspirated.

3449
02:47:06,650 --> 02:47:09,200
When you drive a car like that or like 
your porsche.

3450
02:47:09,201 --> 02:47:11,960
I could see because like in la there's 
porsches everywhere.

3451
02:47:11,961 --> 02:47:16,961
She can kind of slip under the radar.
People may not know exactly what the 

3452
02:47:16,961 --> 02:47:18,590
fuck it is,
but like with the muscle car like that,

3453
02:47:18,591 --> 02:47:21,170
that really just stands out when you 
drove it,

3454
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:23,660
was it like a pain in the ass because 
you have to worry about where you park.

3455
02:47:23,661 --> 02:47:25,970
It's like putting your dick on the 
mirror and then putting,

3456
02:47:26,150 --> 02:47:31,150
putting a magnifying glass over your 
deck and then putting that magnifying 

3457
02:47:31,150 --> 02:47:32,590
glass,
connecting it to a,

3458
02:47:32,591 --> 02:47:37,591
like a gigantic speaker,
projector screens from high school.

3459
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:41,720
That's what it was like.
It was.

3460
02:47:42,050 --> 02:47:44,840
I enjoyed kind of uncomfortable.
What?

3461
02:47:44,841 --> 02:47:49,841
Well,
I enjoyed the people that were cool 

3462
02:47:49,841 --> 02:47:51,941
about it,
but I did not enjoy the people that 

3463
02:47:51,941 --> 02:47:52,670
weren't cool about the best thing that 
anybody ever said is I was at sunset and

3464
02:47:52,671 --> 02:47:54,860
leaving the comedy store and that was 
parked at a.

3465
02:47:54,861 --> 02:47:59,861
There was like a red light and some guy 
walked across the street and the dude 

3466
02:47:59,861 --> 02:48:00,890
was a black dude of course,
because they just have a way with words.

3467
02:48:01,430 --> 02:48:02,570
He looked at my car,
he goes,

3468
02:48:02,630 --> 02:48:04,790
god damn,
that's what I'm talking about.

3469
02:48:05,860 --> 02:48:08,330
He started pointing me,
that's what I'm talking about.

3470
02:48:08,331 --> 02:48:10,430
God damn,
that's a motherfucking call.

3471
02:48:10,940 --> 02:48:13,630
God damn.
And he walked across the street and he's

3472
02:48:13,640 --> 02:48:14,090
like,
god,

3473
02:48:14,091 --> 02:48:14,940
damn.
two more times.

3474
02:48:16,110 --> 02:48:17,860
It's like,
god damn,

3475
02:48:18,320 --> 02:48:22,130
that was almost worth having that the 
bullshit almost killed you in the wheel,

3476
02:48:22,131 --> 02:48:22,880
fall off the wheel.

3477
02:48:22,880 --> 02:48:27,880
Fell off was a real issue and the other 
real issue was the fact that I 

3478
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:31,751
understood from reading road and track 
and motor trend and then online blogs.

3479
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:37,670
I started understanding automotive 
technology because before I came into it

3480
02:48:37,671 --> 02:48:41,250
as a comedian that stumbled upon some 
money and the oh,

3481
02:48:41,320 --> 02:48:43,850
that'd be pretty to drive drive.
And you just go,

3482
02:48:43,851 --> 02:48:48,290
what the fuck is this?
And then I realized that I appreciated a

3483
02:48:48,291 --> 02:48:53,291
car that actually worked as much or more
than I appreciated a car.

3484
02:48:53,511 --> 02:48:58,511
That was beautiful looking.
Is that why you like the porsche robot 

3485
02:48:58,511 --> 02:48:58,550
for our.
Yes.

3486
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:03,720
You know why I like it because there's a
feel to it that it's like I know they're

3487
02:49:03,721 --> 02:49:05,960
not as good looking.
Like if I see a ferrari,

3488
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:08,250
a ferrari four or five,

3489
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:13,250
eight italia is a bound as beautiful as 
someone can engineer.

3490
02:49:14,630 --> 02:49:19,630
I mean it might be less beautiful 10 
years from now because they figured out 

3491
02:49:19,630 --> 02:49:23,781
a new shape or it might be less 
beautiful because there's a new 

3492
02:49:23,781 --> 02:49:24,450
aesthetic,
but to me that's like as.

3493
02:49:24,930 --> 02:49:28,360
But who is this car for?
Is if that's a four or five,

3494
02:49:28,361 --> 02:49:30,420
eight italian.
I mean look at that fucking thing.

3495
02:49:30,421 --> 02:49:35,421
That thing is mid engine,
fantastic italian engineering and 

3496
02:49:35,421 --> 02:49:40,101
design.
All those slits you see those with the 

3497
02:49:40,101 --> 02:49:43,251
hood reaches the bumper and there's this
sort of triangular opening that's for 

3498
02:49:43,251 --> 02:49:47,781
downforce and cooling and the vents 
underneath the front bumper off or 

3499
02:49:47,781 --> 02:49:52,460
downforce.
And it's a fucking marvel of 

3500
02:49:52,460 --> 02:49:52,460
engineering.
Plus the

3501
02:49:52,460 --> 02:49:53,850
three,
the racing history of the f one,

3502
02:49:54,040 --> 02:49:56,260
nothing wrong with that.
However,

3503
02:49:57,220 --> 02:50:02,220
a lot of that shit is for other people 
and that's where I feel like a bitch.

3504
02:50:02,770 --> 02:50:05,860
I personally feel like a bitch when I'm 
doing things for other people.

3505
02:50:05,890 --> 02:50:10,890
Sure.
there's a balance between other people 

3506
02:50:10,890 --> 02:50:13,291
and myself and I feel like that balance 
is almost like a gritty old muscle car 

3507
02:50:14,290 --> 02:50:19,290
or a 73,
nine slash 11 rs that you haven't really

3508
02:50:20,441 --> 02:50:23,860
rsr that you.
You haven't fucking done anything to the

3509
02:50:23,861 --> 02:50:26,770
paint five years.
You got chips around your wheel.

3510
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:30,420
Wells age developed some patina.
You got a few nicks in your hoods,

3511
02:50:30,421 --> 02:50:34,270
you know queen shit going on some diva 
queen shit.

3512
02:50:34,271 --> 02:50:38,080
Some steve mcqueen shit for real.
That's what I'm talking about man.

3513
02:50:38,081 --> 02:50:40,900
It's like we've gone to this manicured 
nail era,

3514
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:42,580
you know,
what are you wearing a wig,

3515
02:50:42,581 --> 02:50:43,960
what the fuck are you doing?
You know,

3516
02:50:43,961 --> 02:50:47,020
this is some bullshit going on where 
people are there,

3517
02:50:47,021 --> 02:50:52,021
they're there,
they're gravitating towards the non 

3518
02:50:52,021 --> 02:50:54,541
manly way and that non manly way is 
pulling them there because of scarcity 

3519
02:50:54,541 --> 02:50:59,401
and because it's difficult to acquire 
attractive women that want to fuck you 

3520
02:50:59,401 --> 02:51:00,010
unless you appeal to their aesthetics.

3521
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:00,810
Say what,
what?

3522
02:51:00,811 --> 02:51:05,811
You just touched on something that I 
really believe in this country is a big 

3523
02:51:05,811 --> 02:51:07,050
thing and maybe it's just because of the
way I look at the world,

3524
02:51:07,051 --> 02:51:12,051
but you know,
there is a lot of shit out there like 

3525
02:51:12,450 --> 02:51:15,690
especially modern media,
things like that.

3526
02:51:15,691 --> 02:51:17,700
I was per.
Here's a perfect example.

3527
02:51:18,330 --> 02:51:19,860
You look at.
I'm a movie,

3528
02:51:19,861 --> 02:51:21,740
I love movies.
If they're good.

3529
02:51:21,810 --> 02:51:24,240
Yeah.
And I'm a child of the eighties.

3530
02:51:24,570 --> 02:51:25,050
Okay.

3531
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:26,360
Hey,
hold on a second.

3532
02:51:26,930 --> 02:51:31,930
Let's stop this podcast and we're going 
to start up another one because we were 

3533
02:51:31,930 --> 02:51:32,050
about three hours,
right?

3534
02:51:32,060 --> 02:51:32,540
It's gotta.
Stop.

3535
02:51:32,541 --> 02:51:35,120
Use your mouth to stop.
We're going to stop ustream.

3536
02:51:35,180 --> 02:51:37,520
We're going to come back with the audio.
I'm going to take a piss.

3537
02:51:37,610 --> 02:51:40,610
Justin's going to take a piss because 
people have complaint.

3538
02:51:40,611 --> 02:51:42,750
It sounds ridiculous.
People will complain.

3539
02:51:42,950 --> 02:51:43,400
They go,
dude,

3540
02:51:43,401 --> 02:51:46,520
you know the opposite.
Why your podcast topic three hours.

3541
02:51:47,030 --> 02:51:49,790
We're not going to stop at three hours.
We're going to do an additional hour,

3542
02:51:50,240 --> 02:51:52,040
but we're going to wrap this bitch up 
right now.

3543
02:51:52,220 --> 02:51:55,310
So the next one will be no commercials,
no bullshit,

3544
02:51:55,311 --> 02:52:00,311
no nothing.
We're just going to drain our bladders 

3545
02:52:00,311 --> 02:52:00,620
and we've got more shit to talk about.
Justice and my brother.

3546
02:52:00,621 --> 02:52:02,660
We've been friends for.
How long have you been friends now?

3547
02:52:02,770 --> 02:52:04,840
Five years.
We've got a lot of shit to talk about.

3548
02:52:04,860 --> 02:52:06,490
I you man.
We're going to talk some more.

3549
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:11,640
So let's shut this fucking podcast off.
Let's thank all of our sponsors 

3550
02:52:11,640 --> 02:52:14,470
including a audible.com.
Go to audiBle.com

3551
02:52:14,471 --> 02:52:19,471
forward slash joe and get one free audio
book and 33 days of audible service.

3552
02:52:22,210 --> 02:52:25,150
It is something that I recommend very 
highly.

3553
02:52:25,190 --> 02:52:29,740
I am a big fan of audio books and I'm a 
big fan of audible as a company.

3554
02:52:29,741 --> 02:52:34,210
They've been around for a long time.
The my brother steve marmel used to have

3555
02:52:34,211 --> 02:52:39,211
a gig where he would do five new minutes
of standup every week and I thought 

3556
02:52:39,211 --> 02:52:39,640
about doing that,
but I'm like,

3557
02:52:39,670 --> 02:52:41,620
I don't want that online and it's going 
to be terrible.

3558
02:52:41,621 --> 02:52:43,630
It's new every week.
It could be horrible,

3559
02:52:43,990 --> 02:52:48,990
but marmel had the balls to do that 
every week and he did it through 

3560
02:52:48,990 --> 02:52:51,691
audible.com
and I thought that was a really cool 

3561
02:52:51,691 --> 02:52:51,790
thing they did.
So I've always been a fan of audible.com

3562
02:52:51,791 --> 02:52:54,820
and to this day a fan,
not just because of that,

3563
02:52:54,821 --> 02:52:58,180
because of the service they provide,
the service they provide is excellent.

3564
02:52:58,540 --> 02:53:01,450
One free audio book,
33 days of audible service,

3565
02:53:01,810 --> 02:53:05,440
go to audible.com,
