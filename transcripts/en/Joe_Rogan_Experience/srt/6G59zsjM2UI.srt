1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Getting bigger,
but the video part is getting to a 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
larger percentage.
Three,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,720
two,
one.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,600
Gentlemen,
we're live.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,890
Here we go.
Jordan Peterson,

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,200
Bret Weinstein.
How are you guys doing?

7
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:14,850
Very well.
He's coming in to be here.

8
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,350
I'm excited to have you in.
Hey,

9
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,160
should,
shouldn't be for you.

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,040
Your spiffy.
You make us look a very schlubby.

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,020
When are you doing?
What can I say,

12
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,560
man?
You know,

13
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:24,810
I only brought a limited number of 
clothes.

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,460
Well,
good move.

15
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,310
You look great.
And I'm good to see you as both of you.

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,570
And uh,
so,

17
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:31,980
uh,
whose idea was it to do this?

18
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:33,270
First of all?
So just to,

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,490
I think it was,
I think it was Brett's.

20
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,780
Yeah,
I saw it.

21
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,620
A tweet of Jordan's about a,
or maybe it wasn't a tree.

22
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,930
I did see a youtube clip that somebody 
tweeted,

23
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,810
I don't know if it was you,
your perspective on,

24
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,030
um,
on Hitler.

25
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,060
And uh,
your argument was that he was actually 

26
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,780
even far worse than his reputation would
lead us to believe.

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,320
And it's funny at,
it hearkens back to my first 

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,770
evolutionary project as an 
undergraduate.

29
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:06,771
I was working with Bob Trevor's,
who's one of the leading evolutionary 

30
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:07,290
minds of the 20th century.
He was,

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,780
I was lucky enough to have him as an 
undergraduate advisor.

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Pull this sucker right up to your face 
because you're going to turn sideways 

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,030
because we're looking at each other.
Is that next to each other?

34
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,810
Okay.
So,

36
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:17,430
uh,
anyway,

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,210
I did a,

38
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,390
a,
a project with Bob on analyzing the 

39
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,810
Holocaust from an evolutionary 
perspective.

40
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,090
I wanted to test the question about 
whether,

41
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:28,200
you know,
at the time it was,

42
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,830
it was commonplace for people to say 
that Hitler was crazy and there was 

43
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,650
something that bothered me about that 
analysis.

44
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:39,651
I think there's something actually 
dangerous that we dismiss somebody like 

45
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,760
Hitler as crazy before we understand 
actually what they're up to you.

46
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:44,910
So when I saw your,
your video clip,

47
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,210
I thought it would be worth having a 
discussion so that we could figure out 

48
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,510
what perspective.
Make Sense.

49
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,220
That sounds like an awesome topic.
But before we get to that,

50
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:57,880
I would really like to know what's going
on with you because you're at the center

51
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:01,720
of this crazy controversy of evergreen 
state college.

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,730
You essentially left the area,
your,

53
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,900
uh,
suing the college now.

54
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,910
So where do you stand now?
We have not yet filed suit and in fact I

55
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,720
can talk

56
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,010
about what took place inside the 
negotiation,

57
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:20,030
but we had our first sit down with the 
college yesterday and,

58
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,440
uh,
this was,

59
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,630
uh,
an attempt to,

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,710
to avert a suit,
but I will say from where I sit,

61
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,660
as hard as this is to believe,
it appears that the college has learned 

62
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,680
nothing from this episode and that it is
doubling down on the same foolish sets 

63
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:42,650
of beliefs and assumptions that got into
trouble in the first place.

64
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:45,980
So that,
that is not a hopeful situation.

65
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,900
No.
And for anybody that's not aware of what

66
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:52,901
this whole story's about,
you would either have to go back to 

67
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:52,901
Brett's podcast that we did a few months
back,

68
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:57,260
or please just google evergreen state 
university and Google Brett and you will

69
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,340
be blown away by the incident.
It's social

70
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,670
justice warrior.
Gone Amok,

71
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,940
the whole campus kids patrolling the 
campus with baseball bats.

72
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,390
I mean,
the whole thing is just completely 

73
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,390
bananas.
The president of the university,

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,480
uh,
being told by the children not to use 

75
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,070
his hands when he speaking because it's 
a microaggression.

76
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,220
So he puts his hands down,
the children start cheering and 

77
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,230
laughing.
They don't realize they're being played.

78
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,440
The whole thing is just some crazy grand
game by the children.

79
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,750
And I'm calling them children.
I don't give a fuck how old they are to,

80
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,780
to have power over people.
I mean essentially what this is all 

81
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,051
boiling down to and you really see it in
that moment where they tell him to put 

82
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:40,310
his hands down and he does.
And they,

83
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,610
they laugh and cheer and think it's 
amazing.

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,040
Well,
you know,

85
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,050
they're,
they're educated to do that to some 

86
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,831
degree because one of the tenants of the
postmodernism that they're being spoon 

87
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:49,831
fed is that there's no such.

88
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,840
There's nothing but power.
That's the only thing that mediates 

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,200
relationships between people because 
there's no real world.

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,660
Everything's a social construct and it's
a landscape of conflict between groups.

91
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,570
That's the postmodern world.
And the only,

92
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,080
the only actual means of expression is 
power.

93
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,360
That's why the postmodernists make the 
claim constantly that the patriarchy is 

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,461
a corrupt institution because they look 
at hierarchical organizations and 

95
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:21,361
they're stratified.
Obviously there's people at the top and 

96
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:21,361
people at the bottom.
The only reason that there are people at

97
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,290
the top is because they dominate by 
power.

98
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,620
There's no,
there's no philosophy of authority or 

99
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,620
competence that's all gone.
And so,

100
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,940
and,
and if you're cynical about that sort of

101
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:35,941
thing and you should be,
you might say that part of the reason 

102
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:37,150
that the only thing that the postmodern 
disbelieve in his powers,

103
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,180
because that helps them justify their 
arbitrary use of it under any 

104
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,180
circumstances whatsoever.

105
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,740
And I think that's right.
I think that's exactly what happened.

106
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,810
So it's not surprising that you see this
manifested in that mall,

107
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:52,330
Blake behavior of the students.
It's right in accordance with everything

108
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:57,331
they're being taught so well.
They're also being taught in this sort 

109
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,780
of any means necessary to,
uh,

110
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,020
to get over the establishment.
The establishment is this horrible 

111
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,810
institution and they could justify 
pretty much anything.

112
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Yeah.
This is what like punch a Nazi who's a 

113
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Nazi.
Everybody that doesn't agree with you.

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,250
I mean it's essentially what's,
what's being said Ad Nauseum in,

115
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,260
in social justice warrior circles 
online.

116
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:20,590
And you see,
I've seen punching Nazis so many times.

117
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,040
I mean,
but when it came down to 

118
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Charlottesville,
there was very little punching Nazis.

119
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,800
You know,
the whole thing was like,

120
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,210
it's all,
it's all very insane.

121
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:31,420
We see real Nazis like those are real 
Nazis,

122
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,670
you know,
like go fucking punch them.

123
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,590
Please know they thought.
We've also,

124
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:38,310
I think don't even do that by the way.
Well,

125
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,380
I think we've already figured out 
everyone right from the right to the 

126
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,620
left.
Everyone's figured out that wherever the

127
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:46,570
Nazis went,
that was wrong.

128
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,360
We've all agreed on that.
We're not going there anymore.

129
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,070
And so when someone pops up and says,
well,

130
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:56,071
we should go there,
it's like they're immediately 

131
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:58,621
identifiable.
You can box them in and if you have any 

132
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:00,931
sense like you know,
like many conservatives did in the 

133
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:01,010
aftermath of Charlottesville,
they come out and say,

134
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,380
well,
in case it needs to be said again,

135
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,630
we're actually not allied with those 
people.

136
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,880
Yeah,
well that's one of the.

137
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,160
That was the most disturbing thing for 
many people about Donald Trump's 

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,221
reaction to it,
that he didn't take a hard stance 

139
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:15,410
against these white supremacists showing
up with Tiki torches,

140
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,550
walking to the street,
yelling antisemetic phrases or whatever.

141
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,140
I don't know exactly what they're 
yelling.

142
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,770
I've read a bunch of different things,
but the whole thing was a.

143
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,990
It was an abomination.
I mean it was a horrific thing to watch 

144
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,950
and you know,
Donald Trump comes out and says there 

145
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,950
was horrible behavior on all sides.
Yeah,

146
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,880
well,
I thought I thought about that for a lot

147
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,510
because I got tangled up with that in a 
strange way in Canada.

148
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,620
I was supposed to appear on a panel,
a panel discussing the suppression of 

149
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:49,631
free speech on university campuses,
which was then promptly canceled by the 

150
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:51,710
university that was going to host it in 
the aftermath of Charlottesville,

151
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:56,711
partly because one of the panelists was 
going to be faith Goldie who was the 

152
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:58,790
journalist that was covering Charlotte's
Ville and got the footage of the,

153
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,190
of the car and uh,
and the damage.

154
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,450
But,
um,

155
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,580
we,
we,

156
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:10,581
we,
we're targeted immediately afterward 

157
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,551
with the Nazi epithet and Ryerson cut 
shut down the shutdown in the free 

158
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:12,860
speech panel.

159
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,210
So it's coming up again in November.
Targeted as you were targeted as Nazis.

160
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:17,690
Yeah,
yeah,

161
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:18,860
yeah.
What happened was this,

162
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:19,600
this,
this,

163
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,070
this,
this person put up a facebook page and 

164
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,080
use the swastika with a no,
you know,

165
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,480
like a circle with a line through it and
said,

166
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,540
no fascists fascists at Ryerson 
essentially.

167
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,780
But she used the swastika and she got a 
bunch of people rallied together to 

168
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,700
pressure the university administration 
into counseling the event,

169
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:45,701
which they promptly did.
And then they had a celebration party 

170
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:45,701
the night of the event.
And this is,

171
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:46,970
here's something that was really 
interesting.

172
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:51,971
So they got a couple,
I think a couple of hundred people out 

173
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,521
to the celebration at Ryerson and they,
they were united under the banner of the

174
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,830
hammer and sickle and we're calling for 
revolution.

175
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:03,070
And what was so interesting about that,
and I really mean technically that it 

176
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,311
was interesting,
was that the mainstream media said 

177
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:07,340
virtually nothing about the fact that 
these,

178
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,320
let's call them counter protesters.

179
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,730
I don't know exactly how you'd turn 
them,

180
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,920
had come out under this murderer 
assemble.

181
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,100
And that's made me think like I can't 
figure out why the swastika is an 

182
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:23,471
immediate identifier of a pathological 
personality and the hammer and sickle 

183
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:29,261
isn't.
There's actually a reason it isn't just 

184
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:31,421
arbitrary.
And I think maybe it's something like 

185
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,650
the Nazi is the guy who knifes you in 
the alley and steals your wallet and the

186
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,570
Communist is the white collar criminal 
who,

187
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,780
who takes your pension and you're 
actually more afraid of the first 

188
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:40,790
person.
Then the second person,

189
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:45,791
because the damage they do is more 
proximal and amit and emotionally 

190
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,940
recognizable.
But that's the second guy who takes your

191
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:47,900
pension,
for example,

192
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,660
he's perhaps even more dangerous,
but there's a.

193
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,350
there's a bloodiness about the Nazi 
symbol and an immediate emotional impact

194
00:08:55,351 --> 00:09:00,351
that the heroin sickle just doesn't 
produce and some of that's because 

195
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:00,700
people are badly educated history thing 
density,

196
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,120
but it's pure ignorance.

197
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,430
Just ignorance.
I think that the people that are wearing

198
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,640
those Che Guevara tee shirts really 
understand the history of Che Guevara or

199
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:13,641
do you think he represents this sexy 
South American counter protest 

200
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:15,960
character?
A guy who stands up to the establishment

201
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:20,961
as we know it.
A guy who was wearing a green bar 

202
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,580
wearing a bra hiding in the jungle,
fighting against the oppressive 

203
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,920
dictatorship of America.
I mean that's what.

204
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,400
That's what they're looking at when they
see that.

205
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,350
Well,
the,

206
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,760
the,
the,

207
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,620
the fact that historical ignorance plays
a role in this.

208
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:36,621
It's absolutely certain.
And I think the Romanticization of 

209
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:37,650
people like shake were various exact.
I think you nailed that exactly.

210
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,320
But I do think there's a deeper question
here.

211
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:43,050
It's like I was thinking in the 
aftermath of Charlottesville,

212
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:45,990
many conservatives immediately divorced 
themselves from the Nazis.

213
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,110
Ben Shapiro was a good example and and 
it was very much reminiscent of William 

214
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,060
f Buckley divorcing himself from the 
John Birch society back in the 19 

215
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,060
sixties.

216
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,570
The right wing seems,
it seems to be easier for the right wing

217
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,550
to draw a line around the Nazis and say,
no,

218
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,070
that's not us.
Partly because the right wingers,

219
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:04,050
conservatives are better at drawing 
boundaries,

220
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,260
but you know,
let's say we wanted to draw a boundary 

221
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,260
around the radical leftists.
Okay.

222
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
Point to something.
Well,

223
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:11,580
on the right you say,
well,

224
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,660
you are a swastika.
Yeah,

225
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:15,810
you're out of the club man on the left 
while you believe.

226
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,780
What's the smoking pistol?
You believe in equity.

227
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,710
It's like,
that's,

228
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,930
that's a smoking pistol as far as I'm 
concerned,

229
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,200
but it doesn't have the same emotional 
punch as you wore a swastika to the 

230
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,200
protest.
Yeah.

231
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,830
You believe in equity and you refuse to 
define it.

232
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,920
That would be right,
but that's such a.

233
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,720
it's,
there's no emotional punch in that.

234
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:34,140
It's like,
well,

235
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,660
I'm not going to associate with you 
because you believe in equity.

236
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,830
It's like,
it's too complicated.

237
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,280
It's right.
I do want to back us up here

238
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,440
because the,
I think we underrate the danger of,

239
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,010
and I think Nazis or red herring,
um,

240
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:54,180
there is something that actually does 
threaten to reemerge and Charlottesville

241
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,630
is a version of it,
but I think because we have a cartoon 

242
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,110
understanding of what that protest was 
actually about and how many people are 

243
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,360
actually involved,
we don't really see why this is a 

244
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,501
dangerous and contentious issue and I 
think the answer is an evolutionary one 

245
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,130
that hasn't been spelled out and because
it hasn't been spelled out,

246
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:18,660
it's very hard to point to

247
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,010
but to keep interrupting you,
but just get this right up to your face 

248
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,231
because it sounds good to us.
But the people listening online are 

249
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:26,231
going to have a much better.
Yeah.

250
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:26,231
Just when you turn to him

251
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,510
the thing with you.
Okay.

252
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:28,270
Yeah.
Just get it.

253
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,100
You always keep it a fist from your 
face.

254
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:30,880
That's the best.
Uh,

255
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,370
sorry.
That's all right.

256
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,380
So explain what you mean by this.
So my point would be that what took 

257
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:42,901
place in Germany in the thirties was a 
particularly,

258
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,620
um,
particularly visible,

259
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,800
well documented example of a pattern 
that is much more common in human 

260
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,070
history and because this

261
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,070
pattern emerges as a result of certain 
features of the way evolution functions 

262
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:04,801
in the context of humans,
it is actually always a danger that it 

263
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:09,061
will reemerge and knowing what to do 
about it is a not so simple until you've

264
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:13,110
seen why it occurs and what it means.
Um,

265
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:18,310
what I,
what I've been saying in lectures I've 

266
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,190
given on this is that tyranny is the end
game of prosperity.

267
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:26,430
And so there is a pattern in which you 
will go through a period of prosperous 

268
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,350
snus in which it appears that that thing
is defeated once and for all.

269
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,380
And there's no reason for people to be 
going after each other in this 

270
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,811
particular way.
And then at the point that that pattern 

271
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:39,840
peters out,
it re-emerges and people don't expect 

272
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,261
it.
It flies under a different flag or 

273
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:44,791
something like that.
And so I do think that looking at the 

274
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:48,901
tiny number of people who were doing 
what they were doing in Charlottesville 

275
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,780
and saying,
well,

276
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:50,140
that's.

277
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,540
We all agree that this is wrong,
Mrs.

278
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,220
The fact that actually I think trump is 
doing it cynically,

279
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:02,221
but trump was riding a wave that there 
are ideas which are not permissible from

280
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:08,941
the environments in which we all grew up
that are going to become permissible 

281
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:10,810
again if we're not careful to recognize 
that that's,

282
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,260
that's the nature of history.
I think it's highly probable that that's

283
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,220
going to occur.
I mean,

284
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,610
part of the reason that I landed in the 
political hot water that I landed in 

285
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,261
last year,
it was because I was increasingly aware 

286
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:28,530
that this process of polarization was 
going to take place and that the 

287
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,260
continual,
in my estimation anyways,

288
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:34,261
the continual clawing of,
of new ground underneath the radical 

289
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,910
leftist rubric,
especially in the universities is,

290
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,970
is starting to produce an 
extraordinarily dangerous counter 

291
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,481
position.
And that was manifest at least to some 

292
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:45,481
degree in Charlottesville.

293
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:46,770
And so I think you're right.
Well,

294
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,920
I,
I don't want to be complacent.

295
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,390
Say,
well,

296
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,430
we know who the Nazis are and we're not 
going there,

297
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,650
and so the problem is solved.
The problem isn't solved.

298
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,680
There's all sorts of weird activity in 
the non-radical lefts space,

299
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,600
like on the other side of the radical 
left,

300
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:04,720
whatever that is.
And right now what it is is not obvious.

301
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:05,220
You know,
it's,

302
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,150
it's the law.
All right,

303
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:09,160
that's part of it.
It's the Pakistanis.

304
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:10,570
It's this pepe thing.
It's,

305
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,210
it's some of it's comedy,
some of it's satire,

306
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:18,211
some of it serious.
Some of it's the inversion of identity 

307
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:21,661
politics,
which is very dangerous and it's maybe 

308
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,241
the most dangerous thing about 
Charlottesville is that there's 

309
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:27,271
something,
there's something extraordinarily 

310
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:29,401
dangerous about having people revert to 
identification with their racial 

311
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,880
identity.
It's really not a good thing.

312
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,090
Well,
there's the reversion to their racial 

313
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,090
identity.

314
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,970
There's basically an outbreak of 
tribalism,

315
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,310
which explains what's going on on the 
far right.

316
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,300
What's going on on the left is a bit of 
a new twist.

317
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,420
What you have is a coalition of 
different tribal identities that aren't 

318
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,840
large enough to marshal of force on 
their own,

319
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:54,841
and so they're united and together they 
are a formidable force,

320
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,190
but what's going to happen is that 
something that's an unstable entity at 

321
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,181
the point that that forced gains power.
It's going to come apart as internal 

322
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:07,730
dynamics rip it up so it's not actually 
a a,

323
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,570
a,
a,

324
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,690
a.
it's not capable of restraining the 

325
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,111
version that recurs on the right.
The version that does manifest as as a 

326
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,750
white nationalism,
that version is stable because it does 

327
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,591
represent an actual population that has 
an evolutionary basis for remaining 

328
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:32,771
cohesive and I should point out there is
a danger when you hear an evolutionary 

329
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,330
biologists talk about evolutionary 
patterns,

330
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:40,331
people often infer that if an 
evolutionary biologist is saying that 

331
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:43,961
something is a pattern that has evolved,
that that's some kind of a defense and 

332
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:43,961
it is absolutely not.

333
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:48,250
We call this the naturalistic fallacy.
So evolution is an absolutely a moral 

334
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,111
process.
It has produced the most marvelous 

335
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:53,111
features of human beings and the worst 
features,

336
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:57,760
and we are in some sense obligated to 
pick and choose which features to honor 

337
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,390
and and promote and which ones to tamp 
down.

338
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Something can have something can have 
evolved as a virtue in some 

339
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,561
circumstances and still be of the type 
that if magnified beyond its proper 

340
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,250
limits,
becomes pathological.

341
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,740
So let me tell you something I learned 
about Hitler,

342
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,430
which really I haven't recovered from my
shock from this.

343
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,570
So we'd been looking at the relationship
between political belief in personality.

344
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Okay,
and your political belief is strongly 

345
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,960
determined by your temperament.
So liberal left types are high in trait,

346
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:31,961
openness,
that's creativity and low in 

347
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,581
conscientiousness,
but you can fragment conscientiousness 

348
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:36,281
up into industriousness and orderliness.
And the real predictor for conservatism 

349
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:37,490
is an orderliness,
not industriousness,

350
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,470
and you might think,
well that's no surprise,

351
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:42,530
right wingers are more orderly,
hence Hitler's call for order,

352
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:47,531
let's say,
but it's one thing to to to posit that 

353
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:47,900
and another thing to measure it.

354
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:53,170
Now it's measurable and it appears that 
orderliness is associated with 

355
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,720
sensitivity to discussed.
And this is actually a really big deal.

356
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,330
It's a really big deal.
So there's a paper that was published in

357
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:04,331
Plos one about three years ago looking 
at the relationship between the 

358
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:08,591
prevalence of infectious diseases and 
authoritarian political attitudes and 

359
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:11,600
they did it country by country and then 
within countries by state or province.

360
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,960
And the correlation between the 
prevalence of infectious diseases and 

361
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,621
authoritarians slash right wing 
political beliefs at the local 

362
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:23,681
individual level was point six.
And so I want to take this apart a 

363
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:24,050
little bit.
Okay.

364
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:29,051
So the idea is that this is part of what
you might describe as the extended 

365
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:33,971
behavioral immune system.
And one of the problems with the 

366
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,250
interactions between groups of human 
beings in our evolutionary past was what

367
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,360
exactly what happened to the native 
Americans is,

368
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,410
you know,
they came out and shook hands with the 

369
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:43,410
Spanish can keys two doors.

370
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,470
And then within a couple of generations,
90 percent of them were dead of smallpox

371
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:50,471
and measles and mumps.
And so it's been a truism in our past 

372
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:54,570
that if you meet a group of isolated,
if you're a group of isolated humans and

373
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:57,480
you meet another group of isolated 
humans and you trade pathogens,

374
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:02,481
there's a real possibility that you and 
everyone you know are going to be dead 

375
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:06,081
in no time flat.
And so we have a disgust mechanism that 

376
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,440
that produces this implicit,
let's call it racial racial and ethnic 

377
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:16,521
bias.
That is part and parcel of the human 

378
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:18,561
cognitive landscape.
But the problem with that is that it's 

379
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:20,841
rooted in a disgust mechanism that 
actually serves as a protective 

380
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:20,841
function.
Now,

381
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:25,040
when I was sorting this out,
I was reading Hitler's table talk and 

382
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,410
Hitler's table talk is a very 
interesting book.

383
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:30,411
It's a book,
a book of his spontaneous mealtime 

384
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:31,530
utterances from 1939 to 1942.

385
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,980
And I went through with this new 
knowledge because people think of 

386
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,790
conservatives as like or fascist as 
afraid of those who are different.

387
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,770
They're not afraid,
they're disgusted.

388
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,410
And that's not the same thing because 
you burn things,

389
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:48,411
you're disgusted by.
And so it was terrifying to me to read 

390
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:48,660
it because then I also thought,
oh well,

391
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,930
disgust,
sensitivity is associated with 

392
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,330
orderliness and you need order in a 
society in order to maintain it.

393
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:59,331
And the Germans are very orderly and 
that was actually a canonical part of 

394
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:02,541
their civilization and part of actually 
what makes them great and powerful and 

395
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,741
that just had to tilt a little farther 
than necessary and all of a sudden 

396
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,370
everything needed to be cleaned.
And you know,

397
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:11,130
Hitler talked about cleanliness all the 
time and he actually meant that.

398
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,440
And so this thing that's emerging,
you know,

399
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:16,500
you talked about a biological basis,
it's evolutionary basis.

400
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,770
It is.
It's part of this deeply rooted disgust 

401
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,711
system that protects us from dangerous 
pathogens that can manifest itself in 

402
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:25,890
and does manifest itself in the 
political realm.

403
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:31,310
It's not good.
So he don't know exactly how to tease 

404
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,271
this apart.
But I agree with your point about 

405
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:36,930
there's an actual danger when 
populations meet like a literal pathogen

406
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,080
danger and that,
that is liable to have produced a 

407
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,200
certain instinct of a fear of,
of the other,

408
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,630
which doesn't have to be limited to that
one thing,

409
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:50,631
but that's enough to generate a 
selective force that would cause a 

410
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:51,380
certain reluctance,
um,

411
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,160
to meet.
But I want,

412
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:58,161
I want to point out that at least in the
West and probably universally human 

413
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:02,961
beings when they go to war,
tend to dehumanize the other population 

414
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:03,180
and,
you know,

415
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:06,570
so of course,
calling the other population,

416
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,850
sub human vermin,
whatever it is that,

417
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,960
that human beings do.

418
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,230
And my concern is that we are doing 
exactly this with the Nazis are defacto 

419
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,710
Nazis who are showing up,
uh,

420
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,080
on,
uh,

421
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,110
on our screens at this point that what 
we are doing is we are comforting 

422
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,300
ourselves by saying,
well,

423
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:27,720
that's a small outbreak of something 
that makes these people subhuman,

424
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,940
justifies punching them or whatever.
And I'm,

425
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,960
you know,
I'm not squeamish about there being a 

426
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,440
right to violence when somebody is 
threatening a way of life.

427
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,470
So it's not that.
But my concern is that if you take the 

428
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,461
pathogen model and you imagine that all 
those folks who showed up in 

429
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:48,370
Charlottesville,
that that is a contagion and it needs to

430
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:53,371
be isolated,
then you will have the sense that as 

431
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:55,741
long as you do that,
it's not going to show up somewhere 

432
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:58,360
else.
Whereas what's I think the,

433
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,390
the actual hazard is that that's 
actually a latent program that has 

434
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,890
served populations in past 
circumstances.

435
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,890
It's indefensible,
but it has served populations and the 

436
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,730
populations that we come from have it 
therefore on reserve.

437
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,970
And when certain characteristics show up
in the environment,

438
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,150
that program can emerge.
And so my concern is that that's where 

439
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,721
we are in history,
can't be isolated as a phenomena that's 

440
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:27,541
associated with the other.
In one of the things I've done for 

441
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,980
decades is teach my students a variant 
of that which is something like.

442
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:32,710
Because we,
I try to walk them through understanding

443
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:36,100
psychological understanding of what 
happened in Nazi Germany and in the more

444
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:38,500
intense situations like in places like 
in Auschwitz.

445
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:40,300
And so the question might be,
well,

446
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,130
if you were in Germany than in the 19 
thirties,

447
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:44,290
could you be a cancer concentration camp
guard?

448
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:49,590
And the gut reaction to that is no,
those people are unlike me and that's 

449
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,210
the wrong response.
The right response is those people,

450
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:56,050
we're human and I'm also human,
and so that means that the Nazi is us.

451
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,810
That's what it means.
And so the.

452
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,830
And who the hell wants to think that no 
one will think that and I have thought 

453
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,670
that through because I thought through 
for a variety of reasons what the limits

454
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:11,671
of my potential behavior are and the 
limits of my potential and maybe I'm 

455
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:12,220
more pathological than the average 
person.

456
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:17,221
It's certainly possible,
but I understand that the limits of my 

457
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:20,101
potential behavior are far beyond the 
bounds of what people would normally 

458
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:23,701
consider civilized.
And I think that's characteristic of 

459
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:23,701
human beings in general.
Well,

460
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:24,650
I mean looking.
Oh,

461
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,150
go ahead.

462
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,350
No,
I was to say I think this is one of the 

463
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,031
things that really highlights the 
importance of having uncensored 

464
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:35,421
discussions because we've already hit on
so many hot topics to the point where 

465
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:41,061
you have to really clarify your position
and when you're talking about this sort 

466
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:46,341
of latent program in in human beings and
the necessity for it at one point in 

467
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:51,141
time,
like all these things are very tabooed 

468
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:54,140
to discuss today,
and this is a giant issue because what 

469
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,021
you guys are doing is talking about 
things objective objectionably 

470
00:22:57,021 --> 00:23:00,560
reasonably logically and clearly,
but when you get to these sort of 

471
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:04,700
hysterical subjects,
that's,

472
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,810
that's sort of forbidden today and 
there's a giant issue with that because 

473
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,761
when you have for bidden discussions,
you energize those topics and the topics

474
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:20,061
grow in the absence of discussion and 
the absence of being picked apart and 

475
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:22,770
analyzing them for what their core 
components are and what were you talking

476
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:24,600
about it from an evolutionary 
perspective.

477
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,930
This is very,
very important because these patterns 

478
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,340
are reemerging.
We do see that and I think I need one of

479
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:36,270
us given the wrong neighborhood,
the wrong parents,

480
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,390
the wrong life.
We might've been one of those assholes 

481
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,390
with the Tiki torches in Charlotte.
I mean it's.

482
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:46,070
We're human beings like you said.
I think that is absolutely to discuss

483
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,370
and it's also.
There's another thing going on right 

484
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,831
now.
I've been trying to characterize the 

485
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:57,011
state of the sociological and 
psychological landscape that we all 

486
00:23:57,011 --> 00:24:01,841
inhabit right now and I think we're in a
position of radical instability and 

487
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:04,310
things in the future could be way better
than they are right now,

488
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,460
radically and they could be way worse 
than they are and small decisions are 

489
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,240
going small.
The small decisions that people make are

490
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,760
going to have outsized effects while 
they make them.

491
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Like,
look at what happened with this guy in 

492
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Charlottesville.
You know,

493
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:18,880
this was.
I mean,

494
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,770
I know he was surrounded by a coterie of
of deplorables,

495
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:26,771
let's say,
but it was one guy who decided to do 

496
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:26,960
something murderous and that shifted the
whole political landscape.

497
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,560
And so what I see happening right now is
that we're surrounded by these 

498
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,090
interactions between people that are 
positive feedback loops,

499
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,170
you know,
and a positive feedback loop occurs 

500
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,551
when,
if you do something that it makes 

501
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:42,680
whatever caused that occur even in a 
greater way.

502
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,740
And the polarization is like that.
So I say something left blank and you 

503
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:47,740
say something right,
like,

504
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,180
and that annoys me.
So I get more left and it annoys you and

505
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:55,181
you get more right?
And all of a sudden we're at each 

506
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:55,181
other's throats and that's happening 
everywhere,

507
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:55,700
right?
It's very unstable.

508
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And what what's to be hope for is that 
we can pull back from that and discuss 

509
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:01,820
it.
We can say,

510
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:02,450
look,
you know,

511
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,870
under a circumstance ai could have been 
a communist inquisitor or Nazi prison 

512
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,660
guard.
I need to know that.

513
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,170
And then I need to know what were the 
situations that made that likely.

514
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:14,420
And then I need to know how should I 
conduct myself.

515
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:19,421
So that's less possible.
And the only way we can figure that out 

516
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:19,640
is to have the kind of conversations 
that we're having right now.

517
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,800
It's like,
and this isn't them,

518
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,840
I've been taken to task by some of my 
friends,

519
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:28,841
for example,
for using the social justice warrior 

520
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:28,841
terminology because they've said to me,
well,

521
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:28,841
you know,
you're,

522
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,910
you're,
you're participating in this process of 

523
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:33,910
demonization and,
and polarization,

524
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,460
and I think,
well,

525
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:35,690
yeah,
I can understand that.

526
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Although I'm also like radically 
concerned about the fact that the 

527
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,320
universities,
for example,

528
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,211
are completely taken over by radical 
Marxist essentially and that they're 

529
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,720
driving this polarization and it isn't 
obvious to me how to have a discussion 

530
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,450
about that without participating in the 
process of polarization.

531
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,000
It's something I've been trying to 
figure out for the whole last year.

532
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,380
You know,
and I've made.

533
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,470
I've been emphasizing the role of 
personal responsibility instead of 

534
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,050
ideological identification,
right?

535
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Get it into your head that you have the 
capacity for great evil and stop 

536
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,550
targeting.
Stop assuming that that's something 

537
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,431
that's manifesting itself only in the 
people that you disagree with 

538
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:18,371
politically.
Take responsibility for that and try to 

539
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:18,860
put your life together.
I don't see an alternative to that,

540
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:23,570
but it's been very difficult to to to,
to avoid,

541
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,960
to do that and simultaneously to avoid 
becoming a participant in this process 

542
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,650
of polarization and it's a very 
dangerous process.

543
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,680
It's what destabilized Germany in the 19
twenties and thirties,

544
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:38,681
right?
It was this ping pong back and forth 

545
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:38,681
between the radical left and the radical
right.

546
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:39,730
And your point,
Brett,

547
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,800
that the radical right actually is more 
powerful once they get organized is a 

548
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:44,800
really good one because

549
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,470
there's no fractionation.
It's more stable.

550
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,070
You bet you they have all the guns.
That's another thing to think about.

551
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,940
Certainly in this country,
the right is much better armed and 

552
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,361
that's very frightening thing.
That tariff terrifying thought that 

553
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:03,840
we've.
We've heard this many times recently 

554
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,920
about the trump administration about if 
he's impeached,

555
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,470
that there will be some sort of a civil 
war.

556
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:12,471
I believe Roger Stone said that like 
this thought is so terrifying that we 

557
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,690
literally cannot do anything to stop 
some sort of physical confrontation with

558
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:24,681
weapons if we disagree ideologically 
that it's going to happen.

559
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,400
Well,
first of all,

560
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:28,460
there's a lot we can do and in fact,
you know,

561
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,520
one of the other things about about the 
evolutionary toolkit is that I believe 

562
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,831
we have exactly the tools for navigating
this puzzle there built into us also in 

563
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:42,651
addition to this latent program,
but we are now in a very dangerous 

564
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:47,241
situation because for example,
if Google and other of these online 

565
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,700
goliath start a deploying algorithms 
that decide what we get to talk about 

566
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:57,951
and see,
then we cannot use the very tools that 

567
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:01,350
are necessary in order to escape and 
avoid something like civil war,

568
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:06,351
which frankly communication and debate 
analyzing all the components of this 

569
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,660
issue completely objectively.

570
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,490
Exactly.
Taking the risks that are necessary with

571
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:15,280
that in some of the risks are that if we
have free and open communication,

572
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:20,281
that some percentage of that 
communication is going to be 

573
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,651
reprehensible and deplorable,
but but the but the consequences of 

574
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:27,421
suppressing that are so much more 
dangerous than the consequences of 

575
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:27,421
allowing it that they're not in the same
universe.

576
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:32,370
Yes.
We empower those terrible ideas by 

577
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,970
making them electronically taboo.
Yeah,

578
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:35,680
and then the point is they're going to 
fester,

579
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,120
um,
whereas if we,

580
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:42,570
if we discuss them,
we can diffuse the ones that are 

581
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,091
terrible.
We can spot the opportunities that we 

582
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,091
don't know we have and we can,
uh,

583
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:49,350
we can move forward rather than descend 
into civil war with frankly looks more 

584
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,160
one more issue with,
with Google and youtube,

585
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:56,161
let's say.
And these other gigantic Internet 

586
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:56,161
companies,
you know,

587
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:59,251
it isn't a matter of if they're going to
produce automated bots that do pre 

588
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,620
perceptual censorship,
they are doing that well to explain sad 

589
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:04,620
explaining.

590
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,200
Well he,
he,

591
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,210
he tweeted the other day that um,
and I knew this was in the workings 

592
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,881
because I'd been looking at what youtube
and Google are planning with regards to 

593
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:16,090
their artificial intelligence sensors.
Let's say,

594
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,190
you know,
they want to get to the point where the,

595
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,840
the apoe,
the appalling video is not even put up.

596
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,200
So what happened,
I hope I've got this exactly right,

597
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:27,880
but God,
uh,

598
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,120
was in the process.
You upload a video and then you publish 

599
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,120
it.
And so once you upload it,

600
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,260
Youtube has access to it and they have 
access to its content and they informed 

601
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,440
him that it would be demonetized before 
he published it.

602
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,980
So right here we put it up on the board.
There you go.

603
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,900
Youtube thinks that might pointing to 
astounding.

604
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:48,901
Hypocrisy is too triggering.
There's nothing objectionable 

605
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:49,900
objectionable in my clip.
Unbelievable.

606
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,090
Yeah.
And that one was a manual review.

607
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,870
So I'm wrong about that,
that they.

608
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,950
Although how,
how in the world they decided that they 

609
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,520
were going to manually review God's 
video is also,

610
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:01,480
I mean,
how many videos are going up on Youtube?

611
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:06,481
What the hell?
Why are they manually reviewing his I 

612
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:06,760
sat is not a radical,
right?

613
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,830
That's the thing.
I mean,

614
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,750
he's an evolutionary biologist and that 
makes them a radical.

615
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:16,050
Now it does because he's a Bible 
questioning what's happening and by 

616
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:20,230
questioning what's happening,
you instantaneously get lumped into this

617
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:25,231
right wing hate groups.
And he's also making the claim that 

618
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:28,501
human beings have an intrinsic nature.
And so now there's a new buzz phrase 

619
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:32,161
that goes along with that.
And so that's that you're a biological 

620
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:32,161
essentialist.

621
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:34,420
And See,
so if you're a radical postmodern,

622
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:35,130
neo,
Marxist,

623
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,220
your theory is human beings can be 
anything that I want to make them into.

624
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,670
It's a core doctrine of the theory and 
it's part of what makes it intensely 

625
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,581
totalitarian because then human beings 
are just petty for the molding and 

626
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:50,900
that's part of the motivational drive 
for claiming the radical constructionist

627
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,870
plane.
There's no biological essence,

628
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,250
well,
why do you make that claim?

629
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Well,
because we want to free people from 

630
00:30:59,460 --> 00:30:59,460
prejudice and tyranny.
It's like,

631
00:30:59,460 --> 00:30:59,460
no,
that's not why you make that claim.

632
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,440
You make that claim because you want to 
justify your claim that there's 

633
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,621
absolutely nothing wrong with making 
over humanity in the image of your 

634
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:11,461
ideology and that and that's that.
That that was a well documented 

635
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:16,410
intellectual argument that that that 
will through what happened in communist 

636
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:16,410
Russia,
for example,

637
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,330
because the claim they're explicitly was
you wipe out the past.

638
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,510
There's no real biological identity.
You can mold the human of the future in 

639
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,080
the image of your perfectionistic 
ideology

640
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,720
and the Russians actually sidelined 
themselves effectively with respect to 

641
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:37,630
evolutionary theory that basically they 
were so backward on a biological front 

642
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:42,281
that as they were deploying this,
this very broken ideological toolkit,

643
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,100
they were wrecking their ability to 
think about about how biology works.

644
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:52,100
And so what you're pointing to about 
evolutionary biologist,

645
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:57,101
it's not just that we question the 
content of evolutionary biology is 

646
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,550
absolutely the opposite of politically 
correct.

647
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,670
Yes,
exactly.

648
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,540
Because nobody tells the Biota what's 
right and what's wrong.

649
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:10,541
The biota does what it does and those of
us who look at it and attempt to 

650
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:16,121
understand what those patterns are,
can't help but be deeply politically 

651
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,220
incorrect almost all the time.
And so the idea that the truth of 

652
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:24,740
biology is actually going to become an 
inexpressible.

653
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,780
And we're going to move ahead where 
you're just gonna we're gonna.

654
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,820
We're gonna sideline it so that we can 
move ahead with this ideological stuff.

655
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,570
I mean,
that is cutting off your nose spite.

656
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,230
Biology is racist and sexist.
You.

657
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,290
Well,
if I might,

658
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,600
um,
biology and we're going to have to go 

659
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,711
back here in order to collect a tool,
but a biology does create entities that 

660
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:53,300
have the potential for racism in them.
In our genomes,

661
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:58,100
we carry the potential for racism for 
Darwinian reasons.

662
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,860
Sexism is a little different,
right?

663
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,920
It is.
So I'm about to become very politically 

664
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,170
incorrect.
Oh yeah.

665
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:06,830
I know.
Oh,

666
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,180
uh,
it is not possible for male genes to 

667
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:18,671
gang up on female genes because all of 
our genes spend half their time in male 

668
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:21,380
bodies and half their time in female 
bodies,

669
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:25,370
which does not mean that civilization is
fair with respect to sex and gender,

670
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:30,371
but it does mean that there's no 
biological basis for the evolution of a 

671
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,740
patriarchal forced that subordinates 
women because whatever the patriarchy 

672
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,451
does,
those who are part of the Patriarchy 

673
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,840
become female in the next iteration and 
they suffer the consequences of it.

674
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,680
This is not the case with race.
Unfortunately.

675
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,710
This is not a good thing,
but it is a true thing in a Darwinian 

676
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,821
sense.
One population can gang up on another 

677
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:55,480
population and it has happened again and
again.

678
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,490
It explains all of the worst chapters in
human history and so in some sense what 

679
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:06,221
I'm getting at is that you want to 
understand that process and once you 

680
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:10,331
understand what your genes are actually 
up to and you understand that your 

681
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:12,080
genes,
their objectives in the universe are not

682
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:17,081
defensible,
which are genes want cannot be defended 

683
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:17,510
in,
in rational terms.

684
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:23,110
Then we become free to do something else
to recognize that our genes are up to 

685
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,940
things that we don't have any reason to 
honor and we can.

686
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,660
We can basically take them out of the 
control position.

687
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:34,661
But if we imagine that what our genes 
are up to must be all right and 

688
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:36,980
therefore it can't include anything like
racism.

689
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,510
Then we're just stuck.
Then we don't have the tools to,

690
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,540
to diffuse racism.
So one of the things that happened when 

691
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:49,991
I made my video,
so a year ago complaining about 

692
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:53,390
[inaudible] in Canada and that was the 
one that instantiated transgender 

693
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,920
rights.
One of the things I was pointing to my,

694
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:57,260
like my comments had nothing to do with 
transgender rights,

695
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:02,261
but one of the things I was pointing to 
that was that Canada had built into the 

696
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:05,921
law a social constructionist version of 
human identity and that's actually the 

697
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:06,440
case.
So for example,

698
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:11,441
now in Canada,
it here's the proposition which now has 

699
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:15,071
the force of law.
There is no causal connection between 

700
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,430
biological sex,
gender identity,

701
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,520
gender expression and sexual proclivity.
Technically it's illegal to make a claim

702
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:27,791
that those things are causally linked 
and the causal link claim is a 

703
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,300
biological claim and not only is it a 
biological claim,

704
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:34,301
it's a factual claim.
Those four levels are so tightly linked 

705
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:34,970
causally that there's hardly any 
exceptions.

706
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,860
There are exceptions,
so because every,

707
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:38,280
almost

708
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,360
everyone whose biological sex is male 
considers themselves male,

709
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,780
manifests themselves as male and is 
heterosexual,

710
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,690
so they're late and the reason they're 
linked as well.

711
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:52,440
There's biological and cultural reasons,
but it's now in Canada.

712
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,160
The proposition that they're independent
is now law,

713
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,470
and I was pointing that saying,
we don't want to do that.

714
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:01,050
You don't understand.
You've built social constructionism into

715
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:03,810
the law.
That means that now it's illegal to be a

716
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:06,270
biologist.
Well then everybody said,

717
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:06,630
oh,
no,

718
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,030
no,
no.

719
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,220
That's not happening.
It's like,

720
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,130
don't kid yourself when you put things 
in the law,

721
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:15,870
things happen and we were accused not 
only of being Nazis and that was part of

722
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:17,170
the reason that the,
the,

723
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,260
this,
this talk was shut down,

724
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:24,060
but also of being biological,
essentialist and biological essentialism

725
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:27,240
is the new buzzword for,
for Nazi essentially.

726
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,240
So please do I want to.
I want to correct you.

727
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,670
It's not that it's illegal to be a 
biologist.

728
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,920
It's just illegal to be any good at it.
Oh,

729
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,360
okay.
Well that's even more effective I would 

730
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,360
say.
Is there,

731
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,150
is there concern that putting biology as
fact?

732
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,120
Maybe it will get in the way of 
civilization because we're supposed to 

733
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,931
be moving past all of these issues.
We're supposed to be moving past these 

734
00:36:55,931 --> 00:37:00,491
things as we evolve.
We're supposed to be looking people as 

735
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:01,280
being free to choose whatever gender 
they like,

736
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,580
free to choose whatever sexual 
orientation they like,

737
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:09,730
free to express themselves in any way,
and that by defining them by purely 

738
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,961
biological terms were essentially 
relying on the meat wagon to lead us 

739
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,280
through civilization rather than the 
mind.

740
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,300
That's great that you did a very good 
job of outlining the credible case 

741
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,801
against biological essentialism and 
because it can deteriorate into 

742
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:26,650
something like eugenics,
there's a real danger,

743
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,830
like a political danger on the side of 
biological

744
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:34,990
terminus is a danger in denying it as 
well because then we can't use our 

745
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:39,251
rational minds to truly mitigate 
whatever issues that we would have with 

746
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:40,910
our biological urges.

747
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,280
That's the irony of this actually.
It is an argument to be made that we 

748
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,070
need freedom from our biology.
Yes,

749
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,170
and we have the capacity to do it.
Most creatures wouldn't,

750
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,720
but the way human beings are 
constructed,

751
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,900
we absolutely have the ability to be 
rational about these things and decide 

752
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,620
which things we want to bring into the 
future,

753
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,600
but we can't do it if we don't discuss 
these things in a subset of males are,

754
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,080
are biologically hyper aggressive.
You can identify them at two years of 

755
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,831
age and they're the kids.
If you put a bunch of two year olds 

756
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:15,831
together,
there's a small subset.

757
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:19,731
They're almost all males,
about five percent of males who will 

758
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,030
kick hit bite and steel.
Okay.

759
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:23,040
So that's their biological programming,
let's say,

760
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:28,041
but the vast majority of them are 
socialized by the time they're four 

761
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,400
years old.
So that's amazing.

762
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,270
Yeah,
sure.

763
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:31,570
Absolutely.
Absolutely it is.

764
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,580
Yeah,
absolutely.

765
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,670
Yeah.
And the thing about about boys like is 

766
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,670
that if you

767
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,280
socialize them properly,
it's quite a bit of work because they're

768
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,080
very combative.
My son was like that,

769
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:46,500
and if you socialize them properly,
then they can become unbelievably 

770
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,110
useful.
They're courageous,

771
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,250
they're forthright,
they're,

772
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:48,850
they're,
you know,

773
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,560
they're,
they're,

774
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,000
they're not going to back down from a 
challenge.

775
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,040
There's all sorts of massive utility in 
that.

776
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:59,041
And that's this proper interplay between
the biological circuitry and the 

777
00:38:59,041 --> 00:38:59,680
socialization,
but you know,

778
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:01,570
and,
and with James Demaurice memo,

779
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:02,400
you know,
he,

780
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,380
he was,
he's been accused of taking a biological

781
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,510
essentialist route,
which is not true.

782
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,610
One of the things James said is,
look,

783
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:15,120
there's credible evidence that there are
biologically mediated differences 

784
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,411
between men and women at the level of 
temperament and interest that are 

785
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:22,681
actually large and profound.
And I would say the science on that is 

786
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:27,631
sufficiently settled so that someone can
come out and say that scientifically 

787
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:27,760
credible.

788
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,670
Now that doesn't mean it's right because
the scientists could be wrong,

789
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,910
but what you can't say is that what 
James said was scientifically 

790
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,760
uninformed.
It was scientifically informed,

791
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,800
but he also said,
look,

792
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,040
let's make the assumption,
I'm paraphrasing slightly,

793
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,640
but let's make the assumption that we 
want to,

794
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,870
as a society,
we want to extract maximum useful 

795
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,820
economic value from talented people.
So one of the things we want to do is if

796
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,860
some of those people are women in some 
of them are men,

797
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:58,861
we want to understand the actual 
differences between women and men so 

798
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:01,510
that we can set up the workplace so that
both women and men can contribute to the

799
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:05,110
maximum economically so that they can 
benefit as individuals and everybody can

800
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,080
benefit socially.
So you can use the biological.

801
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,060
So I mean,
for example,

802
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:10,930
one of the things,
here's,

803
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:12,250
here's a biological problem.

804
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,110
On average women are more agreeable than
men and I think that's because agreeable

805
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:21,370
people are their self sacrificing and I 
think as a woman you need to be wired to

806
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:24,790
be self sacrificing or you won't be able
to tolerate taking care of infants.

807
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,780
That's my sense of it.
Okay.

808
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,550
Now there's some problems with that.
It's like,

809
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,190
let's say that a huge part of female 
wiring is tilted in the direction of the

810
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:35,500
necessity of self sacrifice for infant 
care.

811
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,850
Okay.
That doesn't equip women very well for 

812
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,021
dealing with aggressive meant because of
aggressive men and infants are not the 

813
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:44,470
same creatures.
So women play a pay,

814
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:48,550
a price being optimized to some degree 
for infant care.

815
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:51,070
They pay a price that they're less,
uh,

816
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,070
what would you call prepared?
That's one way of thinking about it.

817
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Indeed,
with dealing with hyper aggressive and 

818
00:40:59,840 --> 00:40:59,840
competitive meant,
well,

819
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,541
one of the consequences of that is that 
agreeable people don't make as much 

820
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,300
money and the reason for that is to make
money.

821
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:09,301
You actually have to be disagreeable 
because you have to go to your boss and 

822
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:12,031
say,
give me some bloody money or something 

823
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:12,540
you don't like will happen to you.
You have to leave.

824
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,530
You have to be able to fight for an idea
too.

825
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,060
But so there's something that,
this is a perfect test case.

826
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:24,210
So biologically speaking,
there's a very good reason for certain 

827
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:28,330
kinds of wisdom to be biased in the 
direction of manifesting in females,

828
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,900
females,
because they have the capacity to have 

829
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:33,900
fewer offspring,
a lifetime

830
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,290
than males,
uh,

831
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,760
are uh,
obligated,

832
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,130
as you say,
to um,

833
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,160
to care in a particular way.
And the fact that care and human beings 

834
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,020
take so many years has resulted in 
menopause emerging and menopause.

835
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,230
Essentially,
when a woman is done producing new 

836
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,481
offspring,
her interests in her evolutionary 

837
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:57,290
interest,
which in this case I think our honorable

838
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,860
becomes synonymous with the lineage,
the population,

839
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:05,890
because her offspring will either do 
well or do poorly based on the 

840
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,031
population that they're in.
So women have a kind of farsightedness 

841
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:14,710
about lineage and I don't think it has 
anything to do with human women 

842
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,681
actually.
This is a trait that we can see in 

843
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:19,790
females of other species.
So it's an ancient thing.

844
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,910
Whereas males are high variance.
That is to say a male can have many 

845
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:30,311
offspring in a lifetime.
Many males have no offspring in a 

846
00:42:30,311 --> 00:42:30,560
lifetime,
and that high variance means that to the

847
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:35,561
extent that there is wisdom that 
surrounds risk taking that has traveled 

848
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:35,970
historically,
uh,

849
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,900
along the male path.
Now in modern times,

850
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:43,901
there's no reason that we can't look at 
these two kinds of wisdom and 

851
00:42:43,901 --> 00:42:45,530
democratize them both,
right?

852
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,810
The fact is there's no reason if you're 
born female,

853
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:52,990
that you can't tune into what has 
historically been a male biased wisdom 

854
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,340
and take advantage of that.
And we should be encouraging this.

855
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,260
There's no reason that people have to.

856
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,720
The problem is is that we can't actually
have a reasonable discussion about it 

857
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,651
because you know,
the discussion is often for stalled by 

858
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:06,780
the claim that well,
men and women are exactly the same.

859
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:11,810
It's like it's,
that's not a helpful discussion and you 

860
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:11,810
know,
with the agreeableness issue,

861
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:12,720
I don't know exactly what should be done
about that,

862
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:16,920
but one of the consequences of it is,
is that there's many reasons why,

863
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,040
why the pay.
There's pay differential between men and

864
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,900
women and the issue itself is very 
complex,

865
00:43:21,901 --> 00:43:26,901
but we do know that agreeable people 
overall make less money in the same 

866
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:29,280
positions and it's because they don't 
negotiate on their own behalf very well.

867
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,520
Now it's conceivable that you could have
an intelligent public policy or 

868
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,880
corporate policy discussion about what 
to do about that.

869
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,180
Like maybe,
maybe the rule is something like you 

870
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,601
review male salaries once a year and 
female salaries every eight months or 

871
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:45,090
something like that.

872
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,770
You know,
and I'm not saying that's a good idea.

873
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:49,340
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying that if you,

874
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,020
if you take the facts on the ground into
account,

875
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,990
there are ways that you might be able to
use them so that you could,

876
00:43:55,290 --> 00:44:00,290
and I'm not going to say level the 
playing field because I think that's an 

877
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,530
appalling phrase,
but maximize the possibility of economic

878
00:44:01,531 --> 00:44:06,531
contribution across the genders,
which is obviously in everyone's best 

879
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:07,380
interest,
but we're not going to do that when when

880
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:10,380
someone like James Damore comes out and 
he's no scientist,

881
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:10,780
you know,
well,

882
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,240
he.
He has some scientific training,

883
00:44:12,241 --> 00:44:15,060
but that wasn't his primary field of 
expertise.

884
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:18,090
He came out and did a pretty credible 
job of summarizing the literature.

885
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,300
He did it because he had been subject to
mandatory diversity training and was 

886
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:28,671
asked to produce a response.
He didn't do it so it would go viral 

887
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:30,570
within the company or become public and 
because he expressed his opinion,

888
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,370
let's imperfectly.

889
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,900
He got fired.
It's like,

890
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,130
that's not good,
man.

891
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,020
That's not.
That's not a good pathway.

892
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,370
Will also wasn't good that his stuff was
being republished without citations.

893
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,820
That people were.
Were publishing it without the 

894
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,150
scientific papers that were sort of 
affirming.

895
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:49,680
What are some of the things that he was 
saying?

896
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,770
I couldn't make heads or tails of it 
until I saw his original version.

897
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,010
That goes back to the point I was making
earlier about this being this is an 

898
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,231
unstable time where people's individual 
ethical choices in some circumstances 

899
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:08,361
will have effects far beyond the local.
It's like those journalists who jumped 

900
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:12,550
on the story did it either badly,
you know,

901
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,920
because they were incompetent or they 
did it maliciously and that and,

902
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,750
and so.
Now we could say,

903
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:21,780
let's say things go really badly in the 
next year.

904
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,230
Well then each of those journalists 
might be able to sit at home and say,

905
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,430
Hey,
I played a causal role in bringing about

906
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:32,850
this state of murderous collapse because
of my little ethical,

907
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:36,180
my ethical lapse when I was covering the
James Damore memo,

908
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:41,330
you know,
because of my own laziness and 

909
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:41,330
ideological rigidity.

910
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,060
I was willing to play fast and loose 
with the truth.

911
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,320
And now I've played a major causal role 
and you know,

912
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
pushing everything towards a state of 
chaos.

913
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,190
It's like people had better be on their 
toes because we're in a situation that's

914
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:55,140
radically unstable and so it's time.
It's a really good time for everybody to

915
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:58,950
be very careful about what they write 
and say and about their motives for,

916
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,230
for tarring and feathering the 
opposition.

917
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:06,231
That's another way of.
Another thing that we have to be very 

918
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,631
careful about.
It's just very bizarre how quick people 

919
00:46:08,631 --> 00:46:09,540
are to call someone a racist today.
I mean,

920
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:11,760
I've never seen anything like it in all 
my years.

921
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:13,680
It's,
it's a strange time.

922
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,430
You know,
I got into it yesterday just I got bored

923
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:19,410
and I started trolling with pepe the 
frog.

924
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,830
I started putting up the frog with 
rainbow saying this seems like a frog 

925
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,170
that's really into gay rights.

926
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,620
Like here's a frog that holding a lemon 
with a tart face.

927
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:32,220
Like this is a frog that ate a lemon and
he's reacting to it.

928
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:36,180
Like how has this all racist?
Like how is this like anyone.

929
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:39,720
It's not like all these people that are 
creating this frog are coordinating.

930
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:45,080
Anyone can make a meme with the frog and
like a lot of the original feels good 

931
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,770
man cartoons that the guy created,
the,

932
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,190
those are applicable to their,
their silly,

933
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:55,191
a lot of them are really silly,
but I think a lot of it wasn't 

934
00:46:55,191 --> 00:46:55,191
intentional troll.
Yes.

935
00:46:55,191 --> 00:46:58,080
So I read a story about Keka Stan,
you know,

936
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,780
I was looking into it trying to figure 
out if it was really,

937
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:05,830
you know,
the menace to humanity that everybody 

938
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:06,540
claims it is.
And the story was preposterous.

939
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:11,541
It was a magical place where were 
antisemites and Jews and atheists and 

940
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,470
religious people live in harmony,
which is like,

941
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,240
that's hard to even parse.

942
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,470
It's designed to,
to cause your mind to throw an error.

943
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,250
Well not is what.
So I think this is an excellent thing to

944
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:28,710
talk about because I've been,
because I've been,

945
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,800
let's say,
identified under many circumstances now 

946
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:33,800
with the.
All right,

947
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,460
I've been doing every bit of 
investigation I can into its many 

948
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,730
manifestations.
It's a very confusing place.

949
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,790
It's certainly not an organized place 
and exactly what it is is by no means 

950
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,330
obvious.
And the Keck Estann issue is a good case

951
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:51,331
in point because mostly that's,
that's like a satirical realm where,

952
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,330
where,
where I don't know what it is.

953
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:55,830
It's late,
it's late,

954
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,870
it's defensive humor in some sense.
Let me give you an example.

955
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:02,170
I gave my father a Pakistani flag about 
three weeks ago,

956
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:05,530
three weeks ago.
And when you do that well,

957
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:07,780
because he's been following what's 
happening to me online,

958
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:08,250
you know,
and,

959
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:14,080
and I got associated with the frog in a 
major way and it's a crazy story.

960
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:19,090
I won't go into it,
but I wore a frog hat on one of my 

961
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,660
videos that an Indian carver and native 
American carver had given me and he had 

962
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,620
told me that the frog was in their 
culture,

963
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,530
a harbinger of environmental 
instability.

964
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,260
Because if the water's polluted at all,
the frogs die first.

965
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,440
So the frog,
the frog is the creature in their 

966
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,730
mythology that warns the society that 
things are out of kilter.

967
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,890
It's the canary in the coal mine,
the canary in the coal mine.

968
00:48:38,891 --> 00:48:43,891
So I wore this frog hat and I made this 
video about things being unstable and 

969
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:48,661
I'd been identified with kermit because 
my voice sort of sounds like kermit the 

970
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:49,900
frog and it actually does.
So I've been making jokes about that.

971
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:55,140
And so then I made this video with this 
frog hat and the frog that my carver 

972
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,831
friend made actually had read lips and 
then I made the video and as soon as I 

973
00:48:58,831 --> 00:48:59,530
posted it,
people said that's pepe.

974
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:04,530
And I thought I just about fainted 
literally because it never occurred to 

975
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:04,780
me that that was a connection.
So anyways,

976
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:08,800
I've been tangled in with this frog 
thing in this most absolutely insane and

977
00:49:08,801 --> 00:49:10,870
surreal manner,
but I've been so.

978
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:15,871
And that got me into the Pakistani thing
and a lot of the people that I'm trying 

979
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:18,460
to address online are young men who are 
pushed,

980
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,640
I would say in a right leaning direction
by the movement of the radical left 

981
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,670
alienating.
And then they're thinking,

982
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,500
well,
I'm certainly not that.

983
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,620
Well then what am I?
Well maybe I'm the opposite of that.

984
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:34,621
Well,
is the opposite of the radical left the 

985
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:36,571
alt right or is there a better opposite?
Is there a different opposite that 

986
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:40,111
people could flee to?
And partly that's what I'm trying to 

987
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:40,540
figure out.
But does it have to be opposite it?

988
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:41,680
Couldn't it just be different?

989
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,940
Well that's good question.
The opposition is a real issue with 

990
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:46,940
people,
right?

991
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,480
Like what you were talking about before,
when people just ramp up their positions

992
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:54,481
and get more ideologically based and 
they're doing it as a reaction to the 

993
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:58,081
other side instead of just being who 
they are instead of having some sort of 

994
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:02,101
a personal sovereignty,
they are literally reacting to the side 

995
00:50:02,101 --> 00:50:03,010
changing who they are.
So okay.

996
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:05,470
So what I've been trying to do with my 
videos and,

997
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,010
and,
and,

998
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,280
and I think this is part of the reason 
that they've become so popular.

999
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,390
In fact,
I'm certain of it,

1000
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:15,391
is that I've been trying to agitate for 
the adoption of that personal 

1001
00:50:15,391 --> 00:50:17,650
responsibility as an alternative to 
political ideology.

1002
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:21,490
It's like get your act together,
have a vision,

1003
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,030
straighten out your life.
Say what you think,

1004
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,120
you know,
stay away from the ideological idiocies 

1005
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:30,120
and simplicity

1006
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,090
and oversimplifications and try to put 
yourself together because I think that I

1007
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:34,670
do believe that the most fundamental 
level,

1008
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:39,440
and I think this is the remarkable 
realization of Western civilization,

1009
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:44,441
is that the well developed individual is
the antidote to the tyranny of society 

1010
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:49,391
and biology.
I think that's our great discovery in 

1011
00:50:49,391 --> 00:50:50,030
the West.
It's not like other cultures haven't had

1012
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:55,031
that idea in nascent form,
but it's been hyper developed in the 

1013
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:57,570
west and I think it's right.
And so we abandoned that,

1014
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,380
that,
that pathway of divine individuality and

1015
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:03,440
revert to ideological identification of 
race or sex.

1016
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:08,441
We're going to tear each other apart.
And I think part of the reason we're 

1017
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:08,441
motivated to do that,
Joe,

1018
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:12,791
is because many people don't want to 
bear the responsibility of developing 

1019
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:14,000
themselves as individuals.
So they'll,

1020
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,490
they'll shuffle off the responsibility 
and if that means that,

1021
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:21,810
you know,
we're dancing in the streets because 

1022
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:21,810
everything's on fire,
that'll be just fine.

1023
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:26,380
And that's another thing that's adding 
to the terrible danger that we're in 

1024
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:26,780
right now.
So I think you're right,

1025
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:29,660
and I think that personal auditing 
program that you,

1026
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:34,890
you're a part of is gigantic and people 
look at it as being separate from all 

1027
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:36,050
these issues that we're dealing with 
culturally,

1028
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,320
but I don't think it is.
I think you're absolutely right and I 

1029
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,201
think that there is a real lack of 
struggle and understanding of struggle 

1030
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:48,350
with a lot of people today.
Not necessarily struggled financially,

1031
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,010
but I mean like physical struggles,
spiritual struggle,

1032
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:57,070
understanding that you have to overcome 
difficult issues to really understand 

1033
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:01,400
the true potential of your mind and your
body.

1034
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:06,460
You have to not only overcome them,
but you have to seek them out 

1035
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:06,460
voluntarily.
And,

1036
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,180
and,
and what would you say exalt in the fact

1037
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:11,690
that they exist and that's part of 
bearing the burden of being.

1038
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:15,500
It's like being as a tragic state,
human being is a tragic state,

1039
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,230
so you can shrink from that,
but if you shrink from that,

1040
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:22,390
the suffering increases and intensifies 
and you become resentful and malevolence

1041
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:27,391
yes.
So the alternative is to move forward 

1042
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:27,391
courageously.
That's the Dragon Motif,

1043
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:28,310
right?
That's the hero myth essentially.

1044
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,980
And that is the pathway forward as far 
as I'm concerned.

1045
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,470
It has implications,
you know,

1046
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:38,471
you're,
you're talking about it at the level of 

1047
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:39,200
what is best for the individual.
But we also have a problem which is that

1048
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:42,320
these collectivist movements,
whether they are,

1049
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:47,380
you know,
a white nationalists on the right or a 

1050
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,940
social justice warriors on the left,
they cannot see forward.

1051
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:55,180
And what is missing is that actually the
mechanism that allows us to discover new

1052
00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:00,490
ways involves individuals who are 
capable of thinking independently.

1053
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:06,130
And if you have multiple individuals who
think independently about related 

1054
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,910
matters,
then they can pull that stuff.

1055
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:12,911
But if what we do is we force everybody 
to sign up for the same things that we 

1056
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:17,291
all agree are true.
There is no way of discovering what we 

1057
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:19,280
don't yet know because every great idea 
starts with a minority of one.

1058
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:24,820
So we have to have the freedom to be the
only person who believes something and 

1059
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,770
then to compel others that

1060
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:29,130
it's somewhere in the right neighborhood
and for others to pick up that mantle.

1061
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,960
And so by subordinating.
That's exactly why.

1062
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:37,110
I mean,
free speech is becoming an ideological 

1063
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:37,620
issue and increasingly identified with,
with the right in,

1064
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:39,240
which is horrible.
It's horrifying,

1065
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,530
but the right justification for free 
speech is what you just laid out,

1066
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,560
which is that in order for like the 
collective is a group of what's already 

1067
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:54,081
known by definition,
we inhabit the collective and that's 

1068
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:54,081
what's already known,
what we could agree on.

1069
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:58,611
But the problem with that is that what 
we can agree on what's already known 

1070
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,020
isn't sufficient because we still have 
problems so people have to be out at the

1071
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:06,021
fringes,
on the border between chaos and order 

1072
00:54:06,021 --> 00:54:08,241
where they discover new things and 
communicated back to the collective 

1073
00:54:08,241 --> 00:54:09,240
which free speech does that.
That's the mechanism.

1074
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:14,330
This is,
this is also at a deep evolutionary 

1075
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:17,841
truth,
which is that all of the innovations 

1076
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:20,301
that allow,
whether we're talking about one 

1077
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:20,301
creature,
learning to do some new trick that gives

1078
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:24,501
rise to a bunch of species that do the 
same trick or whether we're talking 

1079
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:26,370
about population is discovering a new 
way to live,

1080
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,140
uh,
on earth.

1081
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,830
All of these things proceed from the 
fringe,

1082
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,050
right?
The people at the center for whom things

1083
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:37,260
are working best aren't going to be the 
ones to innovate the new way.

1084
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:40,680
It's people for whom things are not 
quite working that are going to innovate

1085
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,980
new ways and that that's also true for a
population of frogs or birds or plants 

1086
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,091
or whatever.
The ones that are not well situated are 

1087
00:54:50,091 --> 00:54:50,091
the ones where an experiment can pay 
off.

1088
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:55,610
That's why hands eyes and Keke.
Psychologist wrote a good book called 

1089
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:58,911
Genius and he was interested in what 
predicted high levels of creative 

1090
00:54:58,911 --> 00:54:59,610
success and some of it's what you'd 
expect.

1091
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,550
Iq is one of them and creative 
temperament is another,

1092
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:06,180
but losing a parent before the age of 10
was a nice predictor.

1093
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,730
And you know,
people think about creativity as if it's

1094
00:55:08,731 --> 00:55:10,920
all sweetness and light.
It's like no bloody way,

1095
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:11,250
man.

1096
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:16,610
If you're going to be creative,
it's because you're tormented by a 

1097
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:16,610
problem.
Right?

1098
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:17,700
And so if you're not in a position to be
tormented by a problem,

1099
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:20,790
you're not going to put it in the time 
and effort and take the risk necessarily

1100
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,830
necessary to be creative.
So,

1101
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:27,831
but you know,
I've been trying to understand the 

1102
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:31,131
evolutionary landscape out of which our 
most fundamental religious convictions 

1103
00:55:31,131 --> 00:55:35,230
emerge and the idea that it is by 
definition the individual that innovates

1104
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:40,250
and that by definition therefore it's 
the individual that's the savior of the 

1105
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:40,550
collective.
I mean,

1106
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:45,580
it's hard to.
It's hard to imagine how you could find 

1107
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,411
a biological restatement of an essential
Christian presupposition that was more 

1108
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,190
mapped one to one than that.
Now you could say,

1109
00:55:50,191 --> 00:55:51,870
well,
that's not unique to Christianity.

1110
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:56,990
I see the same thing in the Judaism,
in the Jewish antithesis between the 

1111
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,220
prophetic tradition,
the profit and the tradition,

1112
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,850
because the profit is always the lone 
voice,

1113
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:03,660
right?
That comes out.

1114
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,750
It happens over and over in the Old 
Testament alone.

1115
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,860
Voice comes out and challenges the king 
and says,

1116
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:08,850
look,
you know,

1117
00:56:08,851 --> 00:56:13,851
you're,
you're a blind tyrant and nature is 

1118
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:16,911
moving away from us and preparing her 
revenge and you better watch the hell 

1119
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:20,031
out because you're violating the 
intrinsic moral norms and you're going 

1120
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:23,141
to pay for it.
That happens over and over and maybe 

1121
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:24,190
there are 50 of them and the one that 
gets recorded as the one that happened

1122
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,270
to be closest to,
right?

1123
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:27,880
Because that's the population that gets 
through the bottleneck.

1124
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,880
And so,
you know,

1125
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,290
what we have is sort of evolution 
offering,

1126
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,140
uh,
these texts in a way.

1127
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:36,750
Yes.
Well that's,

1128
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,560
that's,
that's a claim that I'm very,

1129
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,370
what would you call a,
um,

1130
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:46,320
that,
that's something I believe to be 

1131
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:46,320
fundamentally true.
And I mean I've started,

1132
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,270
I started because I'm interested in this
idea of strengthening the individually.

1133
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:54,710
That's when I,
when I wrote my first book maps of 

1134
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,440
meaning it was about ideological 
conflict and it was about whether or not

1135
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,500
there was any alternative to ideological
conflict because you could make a case 

1136
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:01,500
that there isn't.
There's.

1137
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,080
Right.
And there's laughter and there's a war,

1138
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:07,230
right?
But there is a third way and I think 

1139
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,391
that is the way of the heroic individual
and I mean that technically and that 

1140
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:13,420
that involves the development of 
individual character so that you can say

1141
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:18,421
what it is that you think that you can 
articulate your experience properly and 

1142
00:57:18,421 --> 00:57:22,351
that you can bring what it is that's 
unique to you into the collective 

1143
00:57:22,351 --> 00:57:23,830
landscape and that's what updates the 
collective landscape.

1144
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:28,830
It's absolutely vital.
And so I started doing these biblical 

1145
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:32,881
lectures,
Say I've done 12 of them now walking 

1146
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:35,041
through genesis and what I'm trying to 
do because I believe that the Bible is 

1147
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,910
the documentation of the emergence of 
the idea of the divine individual.

1148
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,500
That's essentially what it is.
And we.

1149
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:44,700
We have a very uneasy relationship with 
that collection of texts now because 

1150
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,990
the.
We read them as if they're making claims

1151
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:50,290
about the objective nature of the world 
and those claims seem to be false.

1152
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:55,470
From a scientific perspective.
I don't believe that those are the 

1153
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:55,630
claims that were made to begin with.
So I think it's a nonstarter.

1154
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,690
But I've been trying to lecture about 
the stories in Genesis.

1155
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:03,691
For example,
in a manner that makes them accessible 

1156
00:58:03,691 --> 00:58:04,720
to people who are well to athe who to 
atheists,

1157
00:58:04,721 --> 00:58:05,530
let's say,
and many,

1158
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:08,070
many atheists have been responding very 
positively to them.

1159
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:13,070
I have people in my youtube comments now
that are calling themselves Christian 

1160
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,760
atheists because they can understand,
they understand what it is I'm.

1161
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:19,480
I'm describing this idea that's emerged 
in the west.

1162
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:24,481
That consciousness is the mediator 
between chaos and order and the and the 

1163
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:29,550
and the generating the phenomena that 
generates experience and that and that.

1164
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:34,981
You can think about that as as a,
as a divine category of of existence and

1165
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:40,591
I've been trying to delineate how,
how the biblical stories layout the 

1166
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:46,711
pathway by which the divine individuals 
should manifest him or herself in time 

1167
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,030
because that is what it is and I,
and I've,

1168
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:52,630
I've,
I've been studying for example,

1169
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:55,000
the abrahamic stories which I didn't 
know well,

1170
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,520
and the abrahamic stories are really 
interesting.

1171
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:02,550
I mean,
Abraham is called by God and when 

1172
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:02,550
Abraham is called by God,
he's old.

1173
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:07,200
He's like one of these guys who's 40 
years old and he stayed in his mother's 

1174
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:07,200
basement.

1175
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:07,360
That's,
that's Abraham.

1176
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:12,750
It's a little late for Abraham to be 
getting the hell out there in the world 

1177
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,451
and God basically says to him,
leave your family and your friends and 

1178
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,390
your place of comfort and journey into 
the land of the stranger.

1179
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,150
That's the call to adventure,
and so Abraham does that.

1180
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:20,620
Now he's chosen by God.
You think,

1181
00:59:20,621 --> 00:59:22,070
well,
everything goes well for Abraham.

1182
00:59:22,071 --> 00:59:27,071
That isn't what happens at all.
The first thing he encounters is a 

1183
00:59:27,071 --> 00:59:28,940
famine and to escape that he flees into 
the tyranny of Egypt where they tried to

1184
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:32,300
steal his wife,
so beware of being called by God.

1185
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:37,740
You know,
you'd think it'd be all sweetness and 

1186
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,821
light after that.
It's not bad at all and it's very 

1187
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:39,821
realistic story.
It's like,

1188
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:41,270
get the hell out of where you're safe 
into what you don't know.

1189
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:46,540
Well,
what are you going to find there while 

1190
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:46,540
you're fortunate?
No,

1191
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:46,540
you're going to find the catastrophes of
life,

1192
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:52,300
but if you keep yourself morally 
oriented and you make the right 

1193
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:52,300
sacrifices,
which is the,

1194
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,620
the Abrahamic story to a t,
then you can transcend the catastrophe 

1195
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:59,360
of being and prevail.
I mean,

1196
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:01,940
it's,
who the hell doesn't want to hear that?

1197
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,640
So we're treading kind of close to the,
uh,

1198
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,600
the argument you got into with Sam 
Harris about the nature of truth.

1199
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,660
And since I heard that I've been sort of
itching to have this conversation with 

1200
01:00:15,881 --> 01:00:20,881
you because I think there's a way of 
viewing this that will actually perhaps 

1201
01:00:22,721 --> 01:00:27,721
reconcile the two points of view,
but there's a bitter pill that comes 

1202
01:00:27,721 --> 01:00:28,900
along with it.
So here's,

1203
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,650
here's my argument.
Um,

1204
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:37,290
we tend to think of intellect has 
evolved as having evolved because 

1205
01:00:38,471 --> 01:00:40,360
knowing what's true gives you an 
advantage,

1206
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:45,690
but there's actually nothing that says 
that the literal truth is where 

1207
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,871
advantage lies.
And so I have a category that I call 

1208
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:49,690
literally false,
metaphorically true.

1209
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,530
These are ideas that aren't true in the 
factual sense,

1210
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:57,160
but they are true enough that if you 
behave as if they were true,

1211
01:00:57,161 --> 01:01:02,161
you'd come out ahead of where you would 
be if you behaved according to the fact 

1212
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:02,161
that they're not true.

1213
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:05,650
So let me give you a couple of trivial 
examples that won't be controversial.

1214
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:10,780
Porcupines can throw their quilts,
not true.

1215
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:16,590
However,
if you live near porcupines and you 

1216
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,440
imagine that porcupines can throw their 
quills,

1217
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:20,650
you'll give them some space.
If you don't,

1218
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:24,040
you may realize that they can't throw 
their quills get really close to one and

1219
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:26,800
it may wheel around and nail you with a 
porcupine quill,

1220
01:01:26,801 --> 01:01:31,801
which can be extremely dangerous because
they are microscopically designed to 

1221
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:35,911
move in from where they puncture you 
over time and they can puncture a vital 

1222
01:01:35,911 --> 01:01:39,451
organ or you can get an infection.
So the person who believes that a 

1223
01:01:39,451 --> 01:01:43,231
porcupine can throw their quills has an 
advantage that isn't predicated on the 

1224
01:01:43,231 --> 01:01:44,140
fact that this is actually a literal 
truth,

1225
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,750
right?
Um,

1226
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:51,060
another one might be a.
people say everything happens for a 

1227
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:51,060
reason,
right?

1228
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:56,460
Well,
unless you're talking about physics as 

1229
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:56,460
the reason everything doesn't happen for
a reason.

1230
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:01,110
However,
if you are the kind of person who 

1231
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,451
believes that everything happens for a 
reason and then some terrible tragedy 

1232
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:05,050
befalls you,
you may be on the lookout,

1233
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,520
well,
what's the reason that this happened?

1234
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:11,521
Maybe it's supposed to open some 
opportunity and you won't miss that 

1235
01:02:11,521 --> 01:02:14,131
opportunity.
The way somebody who was preoccupied 

1236
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:16,180
with their misfortune would so literal 
falseness,

1237
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:21,450
but metaphorical truth is actually,
I would argue the category under which 

1238
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,190
religious truth evolves.
Now the problem,

1239
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:31,250
the bitter pill that I mentioned is that
I've heard you say that the truths that 

1240
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,980
are captured in the religious version of
things,

1241
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,320
um,
are basically like,

1242
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:38,450
uh,
you know,

1243
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:43,520
there's an individual truth and then 
there's a truth of your family and 

1244
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,070
there's a truth of the population that 
you're living in.

1245
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:45,780
And these things are all encoded in 
these,

1246
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:51,290
these doctrines which is true,
and you would expect it to be because 

1247
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:51,690
the doctrines are carried along in the 
population.

1248
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,580
The problem is,
what I hear you arguing when you tell me

1249
01:02:56,581 --> 01:03:01,581
if I have it wrong,
is that we should therefore expect the 

1250
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:06,650
encoded metaphorical truths in these 
religious traditions to be morally 

1251
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:13,070
right.
But there's nothing that actually says 

1252
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:16,011
it will be morally right because there 
are metaphorical trues that might in 

1253
01:03:16,011 --> 01:03:17,970
fact be reprehensible,
but nonetheless effective.

1254
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:24,080
And so what I would argue,
the overarching point here would be that

1255
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:30,110
you're right,
that the documents that contain these 

1256
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:33,291
descriptions of things are full of 
things that are true in some sense that 

1257
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,870
is not literal scientific truth norwest 
up their,

1258
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:40,140
their purpose.
What isn't true is that those things are

1259
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:41,620
inherently uptodate.

1260
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,550
Okay?
I mean,

1261
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:49,660
first of all,
the first thing about that is that a 

1262
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,900
discussion like that,
and this is also what happened with Sam 

1263
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,050
Harris,
takes me to the very limits of my 

1264
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:56,050
intellectual ability.
And so even in discussing it,

1265
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:57,590
I'm going to make all sorts of mistakes 
because,

1266
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:03,430
because it's treacherous territory.
But I would say my understanding of the 

1267
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:07,340
great myths has that observation built 
into it.

1268
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,690
So one of the archetypes is that of the,
of the tyrannical father,

1269
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:16,810
which is the archetype by the way,
that possesses the minds of people who 

1270
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:17,390
accused Western Society of being 
patriarchal.

1271
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,520
They're possessed by a singular 
archetype.

1272
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:21,380
And that's the archetype of the 
tyrannical father.

1273
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:25,520
They don't see that there's a tyrannical
father and a wise king because there is,

1274
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,910
that's,
that's.

1275
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,540
You can't even point that out.
But anyways,

1276
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:34,610
in the old,
in some of our oldest stories,

1277
01:04:34,611 --> 01:04:37,550
there's a representation of the dead 
past.

1278
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:41,000
So let me give you an example that 
everyone knows about.

1279
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,890
The Story of Pinocchio is the story of 
the individualization of Pinocchio.

1280
01:04:45,891 --> 01:04:47,660
He starts out as a puppet.
He's a Marionette,

1281
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,790
he's a wooden head,
he's a liar,

1282
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:53,360
and he's pulled by forces that he does 
not understand.

1283
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,470
Right?
Okay.

1284
01:04:54,471 --> 01:04:59,471
So.
But he has a good father that's Japan 

1285
01:04:59,471 --> 01:05:01,600
and so he's got a good and Japan to wish
is that he becomes a real individual and

1286
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:03,500
so,
and he knows that that's an impossible,

1287
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:08,501
which he wishes on a star,
that his son could become an actual 

1288
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:08,780
individual knowing full well that that's
unlikely and impossible.

1289
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:10,820
So Japan was a good king.
So.

1290
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:15,821
But the story is also about Japan 
because what happens is that when Japan 

1291
01:05:15,821 --> 01:05:16,670
will loses Pinocchio,
loses his son,

1292
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,350
which will,
you could think about as the active

1293
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:20,620
dynamic,
attentive force of youth.

1294
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,680
Then he ends up stultified in the belly 
of a whale,

1295
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:28,681
which is a symbol of chaos at the bottom
of the ocean and in Pinocchio has to 

1296
01:05:28,681 --> 01:05:31,060
rescue him.
So I would say there is an instantiation

1297
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:35,650
of evolutionarily accumulated wisdom in 
the great stories of the past,

1298
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:40,030
but they're still dead and it requires 
the union.

1299
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:45,090
This is why in Christian theology that 
God had has a tripartite structure.

1300
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:47,590
This is part of the reason there's God 
the father,

1301
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:53,070
but the father's dead,
the father was right 100 years ago or 

1302
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:53,230
thousand years ago,
and it's still partly right,

1303
01:05:53,231 --> 01:05:58,231
but he's dead.
He can't participate in the updating of 

1304
01:05:58,231 --> 01:05:58,420
the process.
So you need an active force.

1305
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:03,750
Now the active force is the same thing 
that generated those stories across 

1306
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:03,750
time,
right?

1307
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:07,150
So it's the same thing except it's also 
alive in the present.

1308
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:12,450
And so your moral duty,
and this is another thing that happens 

1309
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:12,450
in,
in Pinocchio,

1310
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:13,720
is to rescue your dead father from the 
belly of the whale.

1311
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:19,020
And that's partly what I'm trying to do 
with these biblical lectures because 

1312
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:22,290
you're objection is correct.
The reason it's correct is because even 

1313
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:26,761
if the solution was correct,
the landscape has changed and it's 

1314
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:28,570
changed incrementally or in a 
revolutionary way.

1315
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:33,571
We don't know.
And so those old truths are at best 

1316
01:06:33,571 --> 01:06:34,270
partial.
And at worst blind,

1317
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,260
but that doesn't mean you can just say 
like,

1318
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:41,310
like mounted did during the Cultural 
Revolution will let's just destroy the 

1319
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:41,310
past.
It's like,

1320
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,370
no,
that would be like saying,

1321
01:06:42,371 --> 01:06:47,371
well,
you don't need a body anymore because 

1322
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,111
your body is the collected wisdom of the
evolutionary process across three and a 

1323
01:06:49,111 --> 01:06:49,870
half billion years.
I absolutely agree.

1324
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,800
Because the stories are not literal.
It's impossible to know whether they.

1325
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:58,870
Well not impossible,
but very difficult to know whether or 

1326
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:59,560
not the truth that is contained 
metaphorically is still relevant.

1327
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:02,230
If it's been inverted and it's now 
absolutely false.

1328
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,670
Or Carl Jung talked about this a lot.
Hey,

1329
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:10,830
and one of the things he said was that 
your moral duty is to realize the 

1330
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:12,040
archetype in the,
in the confines of your own life.

1331
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,630
And so you say,
well,

1332
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,110
there's an archetype of perfection that 
pervades the west.

1333
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,000
And for the,
for the sake of argument,

1334
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,130
I'm going to call that Christ the Christ
image.

1335
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:23,410
It's something like that.
That's the archetypal image.

1336
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:27,580
Now we have a story about what Christ's 
historical life was like.

1337
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,880
Well,
well,

1338
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:33,950
well you can't have that life because 
you would've had to be in the Middle 

1339
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,190
East 2000 years ago.
That's not your life,

1340
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:39,970
but what you can do is take the 
archetype and you can manifest.

1341
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:44,970
It was within the confines of your own 
life and what that does is force you to 

1342
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:49,741
undergo the difficult process of 
updating the ancient wisdom and you 

1343
01:07:49,741 --> 01:07:51,190
don't just forego it.
You can't or you can,

1344
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:56,191
but you'll pay a massive price and part 
of that'll be social disintegration 

1345
01:07:56,191 --> 01:07:59,431
because it's.
It's the past is alive enough so that 

1346
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:03,250
those of us who inhabit its corpse 
aren't clawing each other to death.

1347
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:04,750
Well,
we're feeding right.

1348
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:09,930
That's the critical issue.
Now it's not alive enough because the 

1349
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:11,140
bloody thing could fall apart at any 
moment and we need to be awake and alert

1350
01:08:11,141 --> 01:08:13,510
in order to keep it updated and 
maintained well.

1351
01:08:13,511 --> 01:08:18,511
Not only that,
but they're the greatest hazards to us 

1352
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,080
in the present are only partially going 
to be dealt with in these texts.

1353
01:08:21,081 --> 01:08:26,081
And that's,
that's my biggest concern is that if we 

1354
01:08:26,081 --> 01:08:26,081
take a,
you know,

1355
01:08:26,081 --> 01:08:28,700
dawkins dismissing religion,
his mind virus,

1356
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:33,940
this is very dangerous because it 
neglects the truth that you're talking 

1357
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:37,841
about and it prevents us from getting to
a conversation in which we can talk 

1358
01:08:37,841 --> 01:08:41,381
about the fact that religious texts,
religions are not mind viruses,

1359
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:47,651
they are adaptations to past 
environments they do contain a kind of 

1360
01:08:47,651 --> 01:08:48,800
truth that isn't necessarily literal and
is in general,

1361
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:53,830
not literal,
but none of them know ancient religion 

1362
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,080
is uptodate for Google's algorithms 
being the hazard to civilization that it

1363
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:00,680
probably is.

1364
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:05,720
We need to figure out how to navigate 
where the ancestral wisdom is simply not

1365
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,100
up to the current challenge.
Okay,

1366
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:12,101
so let,
let me modify that slightly because I 

1367
01:09:12,101 --> 01:09:15,371
think it's true and not true.
The stories are erroneous in detail and 

1368
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:17,750
write in pattern.
So for example,

1369
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:21,950
there's an idea that one of the things 
that the mythological hero does is stand

1370
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:26,150
up against the tyranny of the state.
Now you don't have to specify the nature

1371
01:09:26,151 --> 01:09:31,151
of the tyranny of the state in order for
that to be a truth that's applicable 

1372
01:09:31,151 --> 01:09:32,030
across different context.
Now,

1373
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:37,050
I would say what's happened with the 
great religious myths is that they've 

1374
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:40,870
operated level of obstruction such that 
the abstract entities are applicable in 

1375
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:44,090
every single environment.
I'll give you an example of that.

1376
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:50,030
It is extremely useful to represent the 
phenomenology of your experience as a 

1377
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:56,441
domain of chaos and order that works in 
every single environment for every 

1378
01:09:56,441 --> 01:09:59,210
person and so the domain of order,
I can describe it.

1379
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,800
Technically you're in the domain of 
order.

1380
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:05,801
When your actions produce the result you
desire and you're in the domain of chaos

1381
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:09,530
when they don't,
and then and then I could say,

1382
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:14,531
well,
your task is to straddle the border 

1383
01:10:14,531 --> 01:10:14,930
between those two domains because you 
don't always want to be where everything

1384
01:10:14,931 --> 01:10:19,931
that you're doing is working because you
don't learn anything and you don't want 

1385
01:10:19,931 --> 01:10:21,050
to be where nothing you're doing is 
working because it's overwhelming.

1386
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:24,500
You want to be stable and dynamic at the
same point,

1387
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:27,920
and the Dallas do that very nicely 
because they have a chaos order,

1388
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:32,950
conceptualization of the,
of the phenomenal logical landscape and 

1389
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:36,191
their claim is the point of maximum 
proper being is right at the center of 

1390
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:41,240
the border between chaos and order and I
think that's true across contexts.

1391
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:44,900
So I don't think that truth ages,
some of them don't,

1392
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:50,350
but the question really is one of at 
what point is there so much legacy code 

1393
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:56,020
that the taking the package is a is more
harmful than it is beneficial and at 

1394
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:00,050
what point are,
you know,

1395
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:05,770
if God were writing today,
I'm pretty convinced the first 

1396
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:06,530
commandment would be thou shalt not 
enriched uranium.

1397
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,110
It would make sense as the number one 
commandment.

1398
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:14,410
It's not there because uranium wasn't a 
a concept at the point that the thing 

1399
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,200
was written or was the hazard of 
enriching it obvious.

1400
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:21,201
And so the fact that it isn't mentioned 
tends to deemphasize it as a risk.

1401
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,430
And so I guess the question is,
is it possible?

1402
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,760
I mean,
is it possible that by recognizing that 

1403
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,631
these traditions carry huge amounts of 
ancestral wisdom forward,

1404
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:41,841
but that,
that wisdom is certain to be so 

1405
01:11:41,841 --> 01:11:44,661
incomplete that it doesn't address 
modern questions that we can be 

1406
01:11:45,661 --> 01:11:50,661
liberated to move forward and to honor 
those traditions for bringing us here,

1407
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:55,761
but to recognize that we actually have 
to move forward with something more 

1408
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:59,690
potent and uptodate,
which is not not easy because you can't 

1409
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,751
just take the scientific truth of the 
moment and implemented a lot of it isn't

1410
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:03,510
even.

1411
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:04,620
Right.
So yeah,

1412
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:07,050
it's also not that easy to rewrite a 
fairytale,

1413
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,450
you know,
and some of these fairytales that people

1414
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:12,450
are trying to rewrite in modern times or
perhaps 15,000

1415
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:15,550
years old and people think,
well we can just update that so that the

1416
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:17,940
modern version will be better.
It turns out that that's very,

1417
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:19,680
very difficult.
And there's another.

1418
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:22,170
I'm going to play devil's advocate 
against my own position here.

1419
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,460
You know,
because I say,

1420
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:28,461
well,
the religious texts in code profiling 

1421
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:28,890
and evolutionarily determined truths 
that are universal.

1422
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,650
Okay.
Which religious texts,

1423
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,520
right?
That's not true.

1424
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,110
Well,
because you might say,

1425
01:12:34,111 --> 01:12:39,111
well all of them,
but then that means that obscures the 

1426
01:12:39,111 --> 01:12:42,771
important differences between the 
traditions and I'm by no means certain 

1427
01:12:42,771 --> 01:12:43,680
that all of them do,
you know,

1428
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:47,130
so I'm going to stick my neck way the 
hell out because why not?

1429
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,410
It isn't obvious to me that Islam does 
because I.

1430
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:55,430
it's very difficult for me to see that 
the totalizing nature of Islam doesn't 

1431
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:58,830
make it unique among religions.
So now good.

1432
01:12:58,831 --> 01:13:00,820
So.
Well there's that out on the tape if

1433
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:05,830
you don't mind.
What isn't the issue using the word 

1434
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:09,041
truth?
Because we can say we could use 

1435
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:09,920
tradition and wisdom and we're okay,
but as soon as we start saying truth,

1436
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,900
then,
then we run into problems.

1437
01:13:11,901 --> 01:13:16,901
I mean,
and even when you're talking about 

1438
01:13:16,901 --> 01:13:18,610
porcupines where you're talking about 
what would you say metaphorical truth 

1439
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:19,040
versus,
look,

1440
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:20,540
it's not true.
It's real simple.

1441
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:25,541
Just don't go near the porcupine teach.
The kid did not go near the porcupine 

1442
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:27,170
because porcupine quills are dangerous.
They get stuck in you.

1443
01:13:27,171 --> 01:13:32,171
They're really dangerous.
Can they throw it at you know they 

1444
01:13:32,171 --> 01:13:34,421
cannot,
but just stay clear of them because you 

1445
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:34,520
don't want them to somehow another get 
in touch with your body.

1446
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:38,450
There's no truth in that.
They can throw their quills at you.

1447
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:43,520
You benefit from being particularly 
aware of the dangers of their quills,

1448
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:48,790
but if you tell a kid that they can 
throw their quills and so therefore the 

1449
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:49,460
kid stays clear of him.

1450
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:54,540
He has a faulty assumption in his head.
You're lying to them for their own 

1451
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,970
protection and I was not good.
I wouldn't do it.

1452
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:59,660
The the same thing can be said of 
everything happens for a reason.

1453
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,770
Well,
here's the problem.

1454
01:14:00,771 --> 01:14:02,660
We don't know if everything happens for 
a reason.

1455
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,840
Maybe when you die,
you go to some auditing room and they 

1456
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:07,840
go,
well,

1457
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,531
you know,
it's all just a part of some gigantic 

1458
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,841
algorithm that you impossible.
It's impossible for you to understand 

1459
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:15,430
duty or limited processing power of the 
human brain.

1460
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:20,610
You're dealing with some semyon,
sort of a complex geometry that is 

1461
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:25,831
really just designed to keep your body 
moving and keep you alive and spread 

1462
01:14:25,831 --> 01:14:26,560
your genetics so that you can eventually
evolve to the point when you're a god.

1463
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,840
Well,
first of all,

1464
01:14:28,841 --> 01:14:29,900
I.
I have kids.

1465
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,010
I wouldn't tell them that a porcupine,
I'm sure will,

1466
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,370
but how,
but why use the word truth though?

1467
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:35,000
Because.
Well,

1468
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:38,970
the question is why do people tell you 
that a porcupine him through it's quilt?

1469
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,280
I don't.
I don't think they do.

1470
01:14:40,281 --> 01:14:40,820
Oh,
they do.

1471
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:41,570
Well,
if they do,

1472
01:14:41,571 --> 01:14:42,830
they don't know any better.
Right?

1473
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:48,070
Or they're liars and so all I'm saying 
is that actually that is likely to be 

1474
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:50,720
the product of selection.
In other words,

1475
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:55,780
that those people who had encoded that 
they do throw their quills have an 

1476
01:14:55,780 --> 01:15:00,161
advantage.
It's not the way I would do it and for 

1477
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:02,861
exactly the reason that you point out 
which is if you give a child the wrong 

1478
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:05,840
model of a porcupine,
don't know whether a porcupine is liable

1479
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,660
to be the gateway to some more important
question,

1480
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:12,320
but if it were,
you've just steered the kid wrong.

1481
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:16,220
Something here's part of the problem,
and this is part of this is a really big

1482
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:17,930
problem.
There's two things I guess,

1483
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:22,931
that were brought up by what you 
described in the first is the 

1484
01:15:22,931 --> 01:15:22,970
terminology of truth.
Now Harris,

1485
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:27,980
his claim with regards to my utilization
of truth was that I was absconding with 

1486
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,300
the definition of truth and false 
matter,

1487
01:15:29,301 --> 01:15:34,301
but he was wrong because the idea of 
truth is much older than the idea of 

1488
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:37,700
objective truth and the original notion 
of truth wasn't objective.

1489
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:40,520
True.
It was like the Arrow flies straight and

1490
01:15:40,521 --> 01:15:43,760
true.
It had meant something like reliably,

1491
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:48,880
reliably,
on its way to the appropriate 

1492
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:48,880
destination,
something like that,

1493
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,750
and when Christ said,
I am the truth and the way what I can 

1494
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:52,750
remember of it.
Yes,

1495
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:57,251
yes,
it's the truth he was talking about 

1496
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:59,471
wasn't an objective truth.
So Sam's idea that I had somehow taken 

1497
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:04,510
the idea of truth that was actually 
objective all along and done something 

1498
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:04,610
crooked with it is just wrong.

1499
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,790
It's wrong.
Well,

1500
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,800
the truth can have multiple definitions.
That's the issue and that's exactly what

1501
01:16:11,661 --> 01:16:13,600
we're.
What we're trying to get at here is like

1502
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:14,870
there's,
to me,

1503
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:17,960
there's two kinds of truth and and they 
may be,

1504
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:23,380
they may be commensurate,
you may be able to stack them on top of 

1505
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,931
one another,
but now and then they dissociate and 

1506
01:16:25,931 --> 01:16:27,050
this is actually what what,
what Brett was referring to as well,

1507
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:28,940
so,
so,

1508
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:31,760
and this is where it gets so complicated
that I can barely manage it.

1509
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:37,790
There's a,
there's the truth that manifests itself 

1510
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:40,511
in the manner in which you act and 
there's the truth that manifests itself 

1511
01:16:40,511 --> 01:16:44,891
as a representation of the objective 
world and sometimes both those truths 

1512
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:46,880
are stacked on top of each other and 
sometimes they're not.

1513
01:16:46,881 --> 01:16:50,450
So like I could give you a piece of 
wisdom that would work well if you acted

1514
01:16:50,451 --> 01:16:55,451
it out,
that carried within it and inaccurate 

1515
01:16:55,451 --> 01:16:55,610
representation of part of the objective 
world.

1516
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:58,430
And you could say,
well maybe that's actually the case with

1517
01:16:58,431 --> 01:17:01,070
the biblical stories because if you read
them as science,

1518
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:06,110
they don't read well.
So let's take malaria as a good example.

1519
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:09,440
Malaria.
The root of the word is mal area,

1520
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,220
bad air,

1521
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,250
right?
Malaria is not transmitted by bad air,

1522
01:17:13,251 --> 01:17:18,251
it's transmitted by mosquitoes that live
in places where you might think the air 

1523
01:17:18,251 --> 01:17:21,401
is bad,
so the point is it's part of the way 

1524
01:17:21,401 --> 01:17:21,401
there.

1525
01:17:21,401 --> 01:17:21,401
Yeah,
that's.

1526
01:17:21,401 --> 01:17:22,100
That's a good one,
and then not also gets.

1527
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:27,310
See.
There's another weird distinction here 

1528
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:27,880
and that I was trying to draw with Sam,
but it's a really tricky one.

1529
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,920
We augured in because we started to talk
about pragmatism,

1530
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:35,921
but there's also something like the 
truth of a description and the truth of 

1531
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:40,181
the tool and my sense is that people's 
fundamental truths are tool like we use 

1532
01:17:41,301 --> 01:17:44,450
them to function properly in the world 
and you could say,

1533
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:49,451
well a sharp ax is more true than a dull
ax and actually you can use the word 

1534
01:17:49,451 --> 01:17:54,341
true in that sense.
That actually isn't appropriate 

1535
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:57,220
appropriate use of the word there.
There are tool truths and there are 

1536
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:01,190
objective factors now and in the optimal
circumstance,

1537
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,760
those map onto each other,
but we're not smart enough often to make

1538
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:09,761
the map onto each other because we just 
don't know enough and there are lots of 

1539
01:18:09,761 --> 01:18:12,821
truths that we have that portray the 
objective world improperly that are 

1540
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:16,331
still true.
Is the problem using the term true when 

1541
01:18:16,331 --> 01:18:19,760
sometimes you should use the term fact 
like one plus one is two.

1542
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:22,820
That is a fact.
One plus one is two is also true.

1543
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,420
You throw some water on a match.
That is and it'll go out.

1544
01:18:26,421 --> 01:18:27,930
That's a fact.
Yes.

1545
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:28,330
Well,

1546
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:35,040
I see it.
At least there is this overarching 

1547
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:35,040
truth,
the one that Sam Harris was pointing to,

1548
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,710
the one I think you're pointing to also,
and the one I'm,

1549
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:40,240
I'm imagining we all subscribed to,
right?

1550
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:44,550
There is the testable truth that reveals
itself in the laboratory or in a careful

1551
01:18:44,551 --> 01:18:48,240
experiment in the field.
And that really is the top level truth.

1552
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,640
But then there are the truths you can't 
speak yet.

1553
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:54,740
So let's take the word filth from,
uh,

1554
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,930
from the Old Testament.
Okay?

1555
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,950
Filth means shit.
Right,

1556
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:03,360
you're not supposed to shit in camp 
because God finds it offensive.

1557
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,560
Now,
the problem is the germ theory of 

1558
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,190
disease doesn't come about for thousands
of years after that truth was written.

1559
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:16,880
That truth keeps you from infecting 
people long before you can ever explain 

1560
01:19:16,981 --> 01:19:18,870
that there are microbes that grow in 
humans.

1561
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:23,871
Shit that,
or a particular danger to your 

1562
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:23,871
population.

1563
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:26,600
So the point is,
would you rather be held back to the 

1564
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,650
place where you can actually describe 
the,

1565
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,910
the literal underpinnings of what's 
going on?

1566
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:34,770
Or do you want to be liberated to say 
something that actually results in a,

1567
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:37,500
an improvement in health before you 
know,

1568
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:42,530
literally thousands of years before 
anybody had any idea that it was 

1569
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:43,640
microbes at the root of this.
So you need to figure out so.

1570
01:19:43,641 --> 01:19:48,641
So an elaboration of that would be 
something like human beings needed to 

1571
01:19:48,641 --> 01:19:52,161
figure out how to act without dying 
before they could understand the nature 

1572
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:54,810
of the world well enough to justify that
and somebody be crazy.

1573
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,960
Now that we do have the germ theory of 
disease to to amplify that original 

1574
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:05,810
crude version of the truth or that crude
approximation of what you need to 

1575
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:07,620
believe in order to behave safely,

1576
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,490
there's no reason for that truth to be 
promoted.

1577
01:20:11,491 --> 01:20:16,491
In fact,
you don't hear people describing this 

1578
01:20:16,491 --> 01:20:17,460
part of the the old testament anymore 
because it's not relevant,

1579
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:19,170
right?
This is probably all wide.

1580
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:22,350
Dietary restrictions were in the old 
testament as well as shellfish,

1581
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:26,460
red tide eating pigs trick and gnosis.
There's a lot,

1582
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:28,400
a lot of issues that go along with that,
right?

1583
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:33,410
Well,
there is some intermingling perhaps of 

1584
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:34,410
hygienic concerns with also the desire 
for the groups to distinguish themselves

1585
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:36,150
from other groups.
Right?

1586
01:20:36,151 --> 01:20:41,151
Because you can.
You can unite your group quite tightly 

1587
01:20:41,151 --> 01:20:43,431
by dietary restrictions.
So I'm back to your point about 

1588
01:20:43,431 --> 01:20:43,770
terminology.
You know,

1589
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:48,771
we could,
we could do something like fact and 

1590
01:20:48,771 --> 01:20:49,080
wisdom.
Will you say truth.

1591
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:54,110
That's the overarching category.
And then that divides into fact and 

1592
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,961
wisdom and what you want optimally as 
you want the facts and the wisdom to be 

1593
01:20:56,961 --> 01:20:58,350
one on one to one,
but often they're not.

1594
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,950
And if you find wisdom where the facts 
aren't laid right out,

1595
01:21:01,951 --> 01:21:03,810
you don't just get to throw away the 
wisdom,

1596
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,840
which is what I think happens in the 
case of people like Dawkins and Harris 

1597
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:08,880
and Harris makes another sleight of hand
move,

1598
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:11,580
which I don't like,
which is that he thinks so,

1599
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:14,340
let's say,
except for just a second,

1600
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:16,800
the wisdom fact distinction.
He would say,

1601
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:21,801
well,
the fact is the thing and the wisdom is 

1602
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:22,560
a second order derivation of that.
You can ground the wisdom and the fact,

1603
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:24,810
and I don't believe that,
and I don't think that he has any.

1604
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:28,200
I don't think that he has any real 
justification for that claim.

1605
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:33,440
And this is something I never thought he
would even by grounding the wisdom in 

1606
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,810
the fact thinks,
if you know the facts clearly enough,

1607
01:21:33,811 --> 01:21:36,930
you'll know how to act well.
That's not necessarily true.

1608
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:37,690
Well,
there's,

1609
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,130
there's ways to act with that are within
your best interest.

1610
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:46,370
And then there's ways to act that are 
within the interest of all the people 

1611
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:46,770
around you been might not serve you that
well.

1612
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:52,010
Well,
there's also a distinction is where 

1613
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:52,010
ethics come,
right,

1614
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,240
or what the consequences are delayed 
some number of generations.

1615
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,260
Sure,
yes.

1616
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,070
Well that's a big problem.
And so,

1617
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:01,340
so sam acts as if the process of Mac 
mapping facts onto action is simple.

1618
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:03,750
If we just got the facts right,
but,

1619
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:09,140
but it's the weakest part of his 
argument and we never ever got to that 

1620
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:12,501
for a variety of reasons,
but part of the reason it's weak is 

1621
01:22:12,501 --> 01:22:15,381
okay,
well there's like an infinite number of 

1622
01:22:15,381 --> 01:22:15,381
facts,
man.

1623
01:22:15,381 --> 01:22:19,250
Which so let's say you're standing in 
front of a field and you're looking at 

1624
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:22,221
the field,
the field does not tell you how to walk 

1625
01:22:22,221 --> 01:22:22,221
through it.

1626
01:22:22,221 --> 01:22:25,970
There's a million ways through the field
and no matter how many facts about the 

1627
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:27,420
field you aggregate,
you're not going to be able to determine

1628
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:29,910
the appropriate path by aggregating 
those facts.

1629
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:35,270
So that's.
And that that's a problem that I don't 

1630
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:36,640
think Sam is willing to take seriously 
and well.

1631
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,570
Well I think there are two problems 
tangled up here.

1632
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:45,020
One of them is,
there's a question of are is one 

1633
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:49,611
individual is supposed to have all of 
the facts and navigate based on that 

1634
01:22:49,611 --> 01:22:54,231
sort of the rationality community 
version of things or does the practical 

1635
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,270
truth is we can't all be experts in 
everything.

1636
01:22:57,271 --> 01:22:59,310
And so we have to go along with,
you know,

1637
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:03,120
guides to our behavior that are 
approximate and that's inherent.

1638
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,130
And then there's a question about 
civilization.

1639
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:11,130
Civilization should be guided by our 
best understanding of what's actually 

1640
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:15,481
true,
but with an understanding that we don't 

1641
01:23:15,481 --> 01:23:17,791
have a complete map of a lot of stuff.
And so I think what you're pointing at 

1642
01:23:18,521 --> 01:23:23,521
is that there is wisdom that has been 
handed to us that is not such that we 

1643
01:23:23,521 --> 01:23:23,800
can just simply say,
oh,

1644
01:23:23,801 --> 01:23:28,801
here's the nugget at the center of it 
and we need to preserve that thing 

1645
01:23:28,801 --> 01:23:29,020
because we don't necessarily know what 
it's doing.

1646
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:30,400
Um,
which is,

1647
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:31,390
you know,
that's,

1648
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:35,200
this is dangerous because some of what 
it's doing may not be acceptable.

1649
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:40,530
And then think about,
let's look at the wisdom end of things 

1650
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:40,750
for a minute and talk to you alluded a 
little earlier too,

1651
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:46,020
like iterations and about the fact that 
things are integrated across time and 

1652
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:50,161
that's something that works now might 
fail dreadfully in a month or two 

1653
01:23:50,161 --> 01:23:50,161
months.

1654
01:23:50,161 --> 01:23:50,161
So.
So here's,

1655
01:23:50,161 --> 01:23:52,870
here's what something has to be like to 
be wise,

1656
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:54,790
let's say,
well first of all,

1657
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,390
let's say it would be good if it was a 
new accordance with the facts,

1658
01:23:58,391 --> 01:24:01,930
but we'll leave that aside for now.
It has to work.

1659
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,540
If you operate according to the wisdom 
principle,

1660
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,760
whatever it is,
it has to work in the world,

1661
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:12,870
but then it has to work in a world that 
allows you to maintain your 

1662
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:13,060
relationships with people in the world.
Right?

1663
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:18,061
So,
so it's all of a sudden this wisdom 

1664
01:24:18,061 --> 01:24:18,061
thing is something that's not only 
constrained by,

1665
01:24:18,061 --> 01:24:20,740
let's call it an objective reality,
but it's constrained by the necessity of

1666
01:24:20,741 --> 01:24:23,290
a social contract,
a functional social contract.

1667
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:28,590
So you're only able to.
You're only allowed to put forward 

1668
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:32,911
actions in the world.
That would be a benefit to you if they 

1669
01:24:32,911 --> 01:24:33,640
simultaneously don't undermine the 
structure within which you live.

1670
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:39,210
Okay,
and then there's a game theory element 

1671
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:39,210
to that which is,
well,

1672
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:41,050
if it's wise than it works in the world,
so that'd be the constraint of objective

1673
01:24:41,051 --> 01:24:46,051
reality,
but then it works for you now and the 

1674
01:24:46,051 --> 01:24:49,921
you that'll be in a week and the EU 
that'll be in a month and it works for 

1675
01:24:49,921 --> 01:24:53,371
you and your family and it works for you
and your family on society and it works 

1676
01:24:53,371 --> 01:24:55,720
in a way that those things all line up 
to be iterated across time.

1677
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:01,080
And so this.
This is actually the also the solution 

1678
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,991
is for the.
I really like to hear what you think 

1679
01:25:03,991 --> 01:25:05,881
about this.
I think this is the solution to the 

1680
01:25:05,881 --> 01:25:06,820
postmodern conundrum because the 
postmodernists bless their heart,

1681
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:10,060
so we'll give the devil his due say,
well,

1682
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:15,061
the problem is there's an infinite 
number of interpretations of a finite 

1683
01:25:15,061 --> 01:25:16,480
set of facts and the right response to 
that is,

1684
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:19,540
oh,
that's true.

1685
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:21,490
That's true.
That's not good.

1686
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:22,960
And that's why the postmodern is say,
well,

1687
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:27,961
you can't agree on a canonical 
interpretation of a great piece of 

1688
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:28,600
literature because the number of 
potential interpretations are infinite,

1689
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:33,990
and so then they say,
well why should we settle on any one 

1690
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:33,990
interpretation that why should we 
privilege one over another?

1691
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:34,900
And then they say,
well,

1692
01:25:34,901 --> 01:25:39,901
that's all power games.
And so that's what you got to take that 

1693
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:39,940
seriously.
But what they missed,

1694
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:44,941
and this is a big deal,
it's a big deal I think is this idea of 

1695
01:25:44,941 --> 01:25:45,370
of ethical constraint.
It's like,

1696
01:25:45,371 --> 01:25:50,371
yes,
there's a landscape of potentially 

1697
01:25:50,371 --> 01:25:52,411
infinite interpretations,
but hardly any of them will work in the 

1698
01:25:52,411 --> 01:25:55,831
real world and hardly any of them will 
work in the real world in a way that 

1699
01:25:55,831 --> 01:25:59,611
doesn't get you killed by other people 
or do you because of your own stupidity 

1700
01:25:59,611 --> 01:26:00,250
to failure across time.

1701
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:04,130
And so the landscape of interpretation 
is almost infinite,

1702
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,880
but the landscape of applicable 
interpretation,

1703
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,640
functional interpretation is 
unbelievably constraint.

1704
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:13,940
And I think that constraint system is 
what we regard as ethics.

1705
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:16,070
It's something like that.
Well,

1706
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:21,071
at some level,
stories continued through time for a 

1707
01:26:21,071 --> 01:26:21,071
reason.
You know,

1708
01:26:21,071 --> 01:26:23,150
good stories continue for a long,
you know,

1709
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:25,460
the Odyssey is with us for some reason 
and we,

1710
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:30,610
so there is a scientific reason or 
scientifically investigated [inaudible] 

1711
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:32,420
reason why the Odyssey has been durable.
Um,

1712
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:37,750
we may not know it,
but in principle it's a question you 

1713
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:37,750
could investigate.
Um,

1714
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:39,620
so I guess at the,
at the end of the day,

1715
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:42,020
the problem with the postmodernist is 
that they have a point.

1716
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:46,460
The point is perception gets in the way 
of anything we wish to do objectively,

1717
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:51,680
but that point only takes you so far and
that's why they turned to Marxism as far

1718
01:26:51,681 --> 01:26:52,280
as I can tell.

1719
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,710
Because what happens with the 
postmodernist is they say,

1720
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:59,950
oh,
there's an infinite number of 

1721
01:26:59,950 --> 01:26:59,950
interpretations.
And then the human part of them goes,

1722
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:02,870
okay,
well what am I supposed to do next?

1723
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:05,510
Then since there's an infinite number of
choices,

1724
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,370
and the postmodernist says,
well,

1725
01:27:07,371 --> 01:27:09,380
my theory can't account for that.
And then they say,

1726
01:27:09,381 --> 01:27:10,610
well,
back to Marxism.

1727
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
And so that's why I think there's this 
unholy alliance between the 

1728
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,650
postmodernists and the new Marxists 
because postmodernism is a is a dead end

1729
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,480
from the perspective of applicable 
wisdom.

1730
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,600
It leaves you bereft and nihilistic and 
that's not good because people can't 

1731
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,071
exist without a purpose.
And so they sneak the Marxism through 

1732
01:27:30,071 --> 01:27:33,191
the back door and jump into this power 
landscape for the reasons that we 

1733
01:27:33,191 --> 01:27:33,720
discussed earlier.
So

1734
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:38,960
I really think that it's because of an 
infinite number of possibilities 

1735
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,481
interpretating things because I've 
always felt that it was really just a 

1736
01:27:41,481 --> 01:27:43,890
response to capitalism.
The capitalism is a very negative aspect

1737
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:49,100
of our culture and society and that 
there's got to be some sort of an 

1738
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:49,920
alternative.
Marxism is a clearly defined alternative

1739
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,260
that other people have subscribed to in 
the past.

1740
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:57,380
You could point to it.
It's a structure that's already are 

1741
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:00,070
already set up and it's romanticized and
I think they adopted for that reason 

1742
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:01,920
because it has a socialist aspects 
attached to it.

1743
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:07,100
And they looked at socialism as some 
sort of a thing that regards equality 

1744
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:09,950
and some sort of an egalitarian 
approach.

1745
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,570
Okay.
So we'd have to take two things apart,

1746
01:28:14,571 --> 01:28:17,520
we'd have to take Marxism slash neo,
Marxist,

1747
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:21,020
Marxism and postmodernism apart.
So we could do that historically,

1748
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:25,850
and I would say that although there is a
reason for postmodernism,

1749
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,790
which is the reason we just discussed 
that the landscape,

1750
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,280
the infinite landscape of interpretation
problem,

1751
01:28:31,281 --> 01:28:34,220
it's a real problem if you look at it 
historically,

1752
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:38,090
postmodernism actually grew out of 
Marxism and so what?

1753
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:43,580
What?
What happened is that the Marxists laid 

1754
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:43,580
out their,
their,

1755
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:48,070
their theory about the human social 
environment being composed of a power 

1756
01:28:48,441 --> 01:28:50,990
struggle between the privileged and the 
underprivileged,

1757
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:53,210
right?
The rich and the poor and in its initial

1758
01:28:53,211 --> 01:28:56,570
phases.
And that's a story that's partially true

1759
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:01,720
and it's got a lot of motive power.
Like the motor power is the romantic 

1760
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,741
motive power that you just described.
I get to be on this side of the 

1761
01:29:05,741 --> 01:29:05,741
oppressed.

1762
01:29:05,741 --> 01:29:05,741
I get to be a war.
You're for what's right.

1763
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:11,180
There's the resentment element,
which is that son of a bitch has more 

1764
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:11,180
than me,
so let's cut them off at the knees,

1765
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:13,740
which manifested itself brutally in the 
Soviet Union.

1766
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:19,100
And then there's the ideological 
totality issue which gives people a 

1767
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:22,551
sense of security that took a vicious 
hit by by the late 19 sixties because 

1768
01:29:22,551 --> 01:29:27,321
the murderousness of Marxism had been 
clearly laid out as a doctrine and that 

1769
01:29:27,321 --> 01:29:31,101
opened the door to this move by by 
mostly French intellectuals to to 

1770
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:36,060
develop the postmodern philosophy which 
has these advantages which we described,

1771
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:41,480
but also to use that as a screening 
tactic for allowing Marxism to transform

1772
01:29:41,641 --> 01:29:46,641
into identity politics and so like it's 
hard to disentangle all the motivations 

1773
01:29:46,641 --> 01:29:51,441
there going on in there,
but there's something about it that's 

1774
01:29:51,441 --> 01:29:53,940
that's truly intellectually pathological
because you don't get to be a 

1775
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:54,930
postmodernist and a Marxist.

1776
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:59,160
You actually technically cannot be both 
of those things at the same time.

1777
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:04,340
And the fact that most people are both 
of those things at an at the same time 

1778
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:07,290
raises the specter of just exactly what 
their motivation is.

1779
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:11,850
And then I would say it's this 
resentment driven anti-capitalism.

1780
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,340
There's reasons to criticize capitalism 
obviously,

1781
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:17,760
but it's this underground resentment 
driven anti-capitalism.

1782
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:19,920
That I think is one of the fundamental 
motivators.

1783
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,080
If I can,
if I can add a couple things,

1784
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:28,550
the risk of alienating my last few 
friends in for a penny I guess.

1785
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,430
So here's the thing,
what?

1786
01:30:30,431 --> 01:30:34,430
What's up with the.
With Marxism is A.

1787
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:39,430
There's a lot in mark's critique of 
capitalism that's actually right and so 

1788
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:43,611
that Kinda gets you through the door 
once you start looking at the analysis 

1789
01:30:43,611 --> 01:30:45,660
and then there's the prescription which 
is toxic,

1790
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:49,080
but it's not obvious why it's toxic.

1791
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:54,170
In other words,
it's a pretty good story that doesn't 

1792
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:56,721
happen to function and so people 
gravitate to it because the story is 

1793
01:30:57,181 --> 01:31:02,181
moderately compelling.
It's not game theoretically functional 

1794
01:31:02,181 --> 01:31:06,411
or stable or viable and it does descend 
into this kind of inevitable grave 

1795
01:31:06,691 --> 01:31:11,460
violence and so we know that now 
historically it's not just a theoretical

1796
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:13,620
issue.
We've now seen enough of it to know that

1797
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:18,830
as a fact,
but nonetheless the fact that there are 

1798
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:21,321
people telling the story to kids who 
don't yet know what to do with something

1799
01:31:21,421 --> 01:31:25,860
that sounds like it might be true,
it is very dangerous.

1800
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:28,800
If you don't mind break it down as to 
why it goes bad.

1801
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:32,070
Well,
I mean it's sort of a tired critique,

1802
01:31:32,071 --> 01:31:37,071
but I happen to think it's about right,
which is that it just does not take 

1803
01:31:37,071 --> 01:31:41,270
account of what a human being is and 
what makes society function spoken like 

1804
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:48,531
a true fascist biologically essentialist
wasn't very nice,

1805
01:31:50,030 --> 01:31:51,510
I think.
I think that is.

1806
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,270
Well,
I think it might be related back to.

1807
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:59,790
Okay,
so let's go back to the idea that marks 

1808
01:31:59,790 --> 01:31:59,790
had something to say.
Okay.

1809
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:00,040
And we could clarify that a little

1810
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,090
bit.
So here's the problem.

1811
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:06,360
This is the problem that that seems to 
emerge as the function of some really 

1812
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:10,531
fundamental force that we don't quite 
understand and that's this phenomena 

1813
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:13,030
that I've been referring to as the 
prieto distribution.

1814
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:14,230
Okay,
so here,

1815
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:15,760
here's the,
here's the situation.

1816
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:19,930
If you look at any creative endeavor 
that human beings engage in,

1817
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:24,931
so that would be an endeavor where 
there's variability in individual 

1818
01:32:24,931 --> 01:32:25,120
production and it doesn't matter what it
is.

1819
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:30,480
Here's what happens.
People Compete to produce whatever that 

1820
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,841
is and almost everybody produces zero.
They lose completely.

1821
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:39,660
A small minority are a tiny bit 
successful and a hyper minority are 

1822
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:45,240
insanely successful.
And so the prieto distribution for the 

1823
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:49,410
prieto distribution is,
is the geometric graph representation of

1824
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:53,050
that phenomena.
And so here's how it manifests itself.

1825
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,800
If you have 10,000
people,

1826
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:01,920
100 of them have half the money.
So the rule is the square root of the 

1827
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,330
number of people under consideration 
have half of whatever it is that's under

1828
01:33:04,331 --> 01:33:06,250
consideration.
So this works everywhere.

1829
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:10,630
So if you took 100 classical composers,
10 of them produce half the music that's

1830
01:33:10,631 --> 01:33:15,631
played,
and then if you take the 10 composers 

1831
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:17,770
and you take a thousand of their songs,
30 of those songs,

1832
01:33:17,771 --> 01:33:19,870
which is the square root of a thousand 
roughly speaking,

1833
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:25,350
are played 50 percent of the time.
And so there's this underlying natural 

1834
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:28,390
law which is expressed as the matthew 
principle,

1835
01:33:28,391 --> 01:33:33,391
which is from a new testament statement.
The statement is to those who have 

1836
01:33:33,391 --> 01:33:35,290
everything more will be given and from 
those who have nothing,

1837
01:33:35,291 --> 01:33:37,840
everything will be taken.
It's a vicious statement,

1838
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:42,841
but it's actually,
here's one of those places where it's 

1839
01:33:42,841 --> 01:33:42,841
actually empirically true.

1840
01:33:42,841 --> 01:33:47,130
This happens everywhere.
And so what mark's observed was the 

1841
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:48,340
capital tended to accumulate in the 
hands of fewer and fewer people,

1842
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:50,680
and he said,
that's a flaw of the capitalist system.

1843
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:55,920
That's wrong.
It's not a flaw of the capitalist 

1844
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,071
system.
It is a feature of every single system 

1845
01:33:59,071 --> 01:34:02,011
of production that we know of,
no matter who set it up and how it 

1846
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:05,281
operates.
And so then now we have a problem 

1847
01:34:05,281 --> 01:34:07,860
because what happens is as soon as you 
set up a domain of production and you 

1848
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:09,130
need to,
because you need things to be produced,

1849
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:14,400
then you instantly produce a competition
and the spoils go disproportionately to 

1850
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:18,130
a tiny percentage of people.
So then so then,

1851
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:18,850
well,
so what?

1852
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,040
Well,
so with the rest of the people starve or

1853
01:34:21,041 --> 01:34:23,500
the system becomes unstable because 
everybody's mad.

1854
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:25,150
It's like that's a big problem.
Okay,

1855
01:34:25,151 --> 01:34:26,710
so how do human beings fixed that?

1856
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:29,080
Well,
the first thing we did was diversify the

1857
01:34:29,081 --> 01:34:33,790
number of productive games is so you 
don't get to be NBA basketball star,

1858
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:36,220
but you know,
you can run a podcast.

1859
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:38,200
It's a completely different competitive 
landscape.

1860
01:34:38,201 --> 01:34:41,290
So we can fractionate the the production
landscape,

1861
01:34:41,291 --> 01:34:46,291
and then people who aren't successful in
one domain might be successful in 

1862
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:46,840
others.
That's human creativity.

1863
01:34:46,841 --> 01:34:51,841
We're really good at that.
But the problem with that is you could 

1864
01:34:51,841 --> 01:34:53,460
still get a positive correlation among 
the successful people you know.

1865
01:34:53,461 --> 01:34:55,990
So because you're so successful.
For example,

1866
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:58,010
with your podcast and your youtube 
videos,

1867
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,370
your connection network is insane,
insanely powerful,

1868
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:07,120
right?
So you still have this tendency for 

1869
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,910
what's useful and good to be what 
distributed,

1870
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:13,490
let's call it inequitably and it's,
it's,

1871
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,920
it's got the power of a physical law.
In fact,

1872
01:35:15,921 --> 01:35:18,470
there are people they call themselves 
econo physicists.

1873
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,900
No one knows that there's a field econo 
physicists,

1874
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:26,170
econo physics,
and they use the same mathematical 

1875
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:29,231
equations that represent the propagation
of molecules into a gas molecules into a

1876
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:34,640
vacuum to describe the manner in which 
money distributes itself in an economy.

1877
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:39,970
Okay?
So mark's pointed to a fundamental 

1878
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:39,970
issue,
but he said,

1879
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:39,970
well,
that's a fault with capitalism.

1880
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:40,310
It's like,
no,

1881
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:45,311
it isn't.
It's something way more pernicious than 

1882
01:35:45,311 --> 01:35:45,311
that.
And it's something like,

1883
01:35:45,311 --> 01:35:46,220
well,
when one good thing happens to you,

1884
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:48,020
it makes you a little more powerful and 
attractive,

1885
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:52,040
and so that fractionally increases the 
possibility that another good thing will

1886
01:35:52,041 --> 01:35:55,790
happen to you.
And then that spirals out of control and

1887
01:35:55,791 --> 01:36:00,791
you get people who have,
well they have all the money or they 

1888
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:01,370
have all the podcast downloads.
You're in that position,

1889
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,320
you know,
what is it?

1890
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:08,350
One point 2 billion like what the hell?
But it's to those who have more and it's

1891
01:36:09,411 --> 01:36:11,450
not because there's something oppressive
about you,

1892
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:16,750
it's because you,
you rode the wave of the prieto 

1893
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:19,691
distribution in it and it through your 
way that way the hell up into the 

1894
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:20,720
stratosphere and we don't know what to 
do about that.

1895
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:23,690
Like should you be sharing your podcast 
views with the,

1896
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:26,050
with the oppressed and downtrodden?
Can you've.

1897
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,970
Well you've got a few billion.
You could spread the damn things around.

1898
01:36:28,971 --> 01:36:31,490
It's not fair that you're the only one 
that's being listened to.

1899
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:35,120
It's the same argument and it's a 
compelling argument because why the hell

1900
01:36:35,121 --> 01:36:37,940
should you have all that power?
If you call it power,

1901
01:36:37,941 --> 01:36:39,640
you could call it authority or 
competence.

1902
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:44,680
Isn't that a different argument because 
no one's asking anyone to download 

1903
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:48,911
anything in specific.
No one's no one's compelling anyone to 

1904
01:36:48,911 --> 01:36:49,940
download anything specific.
You could download whatever you want and

1905
01:36:49,941 --> 01:36:53,180
if you put more effort and more time and
more focus into your work,

1906
01:36:53,181 --> 01:36:58,181
whatever it would be,
whether it's a podcast or your youtube 

1907
01:36:58,181 --> 01:37:01,331
videos or whatever with people enjoy it,
they gravitate towards it and then over 

1908
01:37:01,331 --> 01:37:05,050
time it exponentially increases the 
amount of people that are exposed to,

1909
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,870
oh,
this is why I think that the.

1910
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:12,110
This is the other problem with a Marxist
perspective is that and the 

1911
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:15,380
postmodernist in particular,
like they conflate power,

1912
01:37:15,381 --> 01:37:18,560
competence and authority unfairly.
Now your point,

1913
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:20,120
it's sort of the point of free 
marketers.

1914
01:37:20,121 --> 01:37:20,780
You're saying,
well look,

1915
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:23,390
all I'm doing is offering a product.
I'm not compelling anyone.

1916
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:28,900
It's a quality product,
or at least as far as the market is 

1917
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:28,900
concerned,
it is.

1918
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:29,630
If it turns out that everyone wants 
that,

1919
01:37:29,631 --> 01:37:30,920
well,
what's wrong with that?

1920
01:37:30,921 --> 01:37:33,710
And I'm not disagreeing with that 
argument in the least,

1921
01:37:34,070 --> 01:37:37,070
but.
But the problem is it doesn't.

1922
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:40,160
It doesn't fix the problem like the 
problem with money,

1923
01:37:40,161 --> 01:37:43,160
let's say the problem is is that if you 
let a monetary system run,

1924
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:45,710
all the money ends up in the hands of a 
very few,

1925
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,100
have a very small number of people and 
you're saying this is also with any sort

1926
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:51,230
of creative in any creative endeavor,
man.

1927
01:37:51,231 --> 01:37:56,231
Now what is raw make?
I think the real issue would be to 

1928
01:37:56,231 --> 01:37:56,430
potential

1929
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,970
output or maximize the amount of 
successful people.

1930
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:05,180
You'd have to figure out what's.
Don't concentrate on what people are 

1931
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:08,481
doing right.
Concentrator and what people are doing 

1932
01:38:08,481 --> 01:38:08,481
wrong.
Like what?

1933
01:38:08,481 --> 01:38:09,270
Why?
What are the people doing wrong that are

1934
01:38:09,271 --> 01:38:10,800
failing,
whether in any way.

1935
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:15,910
Well that's why we put together.
Just give me one minute all that's 

1936
01:38:15,910 --> 01:38:18,560
partly why we put together the future 
authoring program because we were trying

1937
01:38:18,561 --> 01:38:23,561
to figure out what made people 
successful and one of the things that 

1938
01:38:23,561 --> 01:38:25,700
makes people successful is they specify 
a target and then aim at it.

1939
01:38:26,450 --> 01:38:27,810
Right?
Because if you're all over the little,

1940
01:38:27,850 --> 01:38:32,850
we do know in a,
in a relatively functional society like 

1941
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:32,850
ours,
we know what predicts success.

1942
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:36,830
Iq and conscientiousness are the biggest
predictors of success.

1943
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:40,130
Now there's a genetic lottery thing 
going on there that's kind of rough,

1944
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:45,490
but it does say that smart people who 
work hard are disproportionately likely 

1945
01:38:45,490 --> 01:38:46,550
to succeed and then you might also say,
well,

1946
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:51,640
you want to remove the impediments from 
people who have those capabilities so 

1947
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:54,170
that they can move forward and one,
one of the predictors of success as well

1948
01:38:54,171 --> 01:38:59,171
is to decide what your success is going 
to be and then work hard in that 

1949
01:38:59,171 --> 01:38:59,660
direction and that actually works.

1950
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:03,410
So I think that is a very useful thing 
to do and that's like I said,

1951
01:39:03,411 --> 01:39:05,480
that's partly why we've been working in 
that direction.

1952
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:10,990
So.
But there's other problems that it 

1953
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:13,181
doesn't still still doesn't solve.
One of them is if you don't have any 

1954
01:39:13,181 --> 01:39:15,890
money,
it's really hard to get some.

1955
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:18,920
Like once you have some,
it's not so hard to get some more,

1956
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:21,470
but if you're at zero,
Jesus,

1957
01:39:21,471 --> 01:39:22,640
man,
you're in this,

1958
01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:26,210
you're in the reverse situation,
you're poor,

1959
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:28,220
you don't have anything.
No one wants to talk to you.

1960
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:31,010
You can't get out of it because you're 
too poor to get out of it.

1961
01:39:31,310 --> 01:39:36,310
You know you're penalized by the 
economic system because you can't even 

1962
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:37,220
afford to start playing the game.
You're stuck at zero.

1963
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,410
You're stuck at zero and you can't get 
out,

1964
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:41,390
and the revolutionary types,
you know,

1965
01:39:41,391 --> 01:39:43,340
they go to the people that are stuck at 
zero and they say,

1966
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:44,480
Hey,
you're stuck at zero.

1967
01:39:44,481 --> 01:39:46,880
Why don't you burn the whole goddamn 
thing to the ground?

1968
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:50,030
Because maybe in the next iteration you 
won't be stuck at zero.

1969
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:55,150
And for young men,
that's a hell of a call because they're 

1970
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:57,170
already,
let's call them expendable biological,

1971
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:59,420
and that makes them more adventurous and
risk taking.

1972
01:39:59,421 --> 01:40:04,421
If someone says,
and maybe that's why they wear the 

1973
01:40:04,421 --> 01:40:04,421
severity shirt,
it's like,

1974
01:40:04,421 --> 01:40:04,421
Hey,
I'm stuck at zero.

1975
01:40:04,421 --> 01:40:09,250
Well,
I'd rather be with the romantic who's 

1976
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,900
burning the whole thing to the ground 
than to just had to stay locked in my 

1977
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:11,270
immobile position.

1978
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:16,710
Right?
But that zero is where massive amounts 

1979
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:16,720
of creativity come from because of that 
struggle,

1980
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:20,100
massive amounts of innovation,
massive amounts of people who,

1981
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:25,320
who have visions because you're not 
living off of some sort of a trust fund,

1982
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:25,990
you know,
you,

1983
01:40:25,991 --> 01:40:30,991
you have real risk and real danger and 
you have a real concern about your 

1984
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:35,791
future.
Whereas someone who has no concerns 

1985
01:40:35,791 --> 01:40:36,670
whatsoever and their future is carved in
stone,

1986
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:41,680
they can do whatever they want and buy a
new Ferrari every year that they're not 

1987
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,670
going to have nearly the amount of 
motivation as the poor person.

1988
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:47,760
Yeah.
Well that may be why family fortunes 

1989
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:47,760
tend to only last three generations.
And you know,

1990
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,490
you're saying,
well,

1991
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,460
why don't you take a look at the 
advantages of zero.

1992
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:54,130
And one of the advantages is,
is that you're driven

1993
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:57,320
by brute necessity and that can really 
be motivated against.

1994
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,200
And that's I think why,
why first?

1995
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:02,110
The children are first generation 
immigrants often do so well.

1996
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,630
You know,
they're driven by necessity and it's so.

1997
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:08,200
Yes.
Agreed.

1998
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:09,910
However,
I would still say,

1999
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:15,210
you know,
the zero issue is there are levels of 

2000
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:17,401
absolute privation that are so intense 
that all the goodwill in the world won't

2001
01:41:17,741 --> 01:41:19,420
get you out of zero,
right?

2002
01:41:19,421 --> 01:41:24,421
If you're living in a third world 
country in some very small village with 

2003
01:41:24,421 --> 01:41:26,350
no way out whatsoever,
that is the zero of zero.

2004
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:29,320
You're in Tanzania on the,
on the river,

2005
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:32,080
people getting eaten by crocodiles in 
your village,

2006
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:34,540
you're fucked.
Zero is like a magnet.

2007
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:38,140
It just holds a black hole.
Having a little very little,

2008
01:41:38,141 --> 01:41:41,530
maybe that motivational state actually a
generative,

2009
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,730
right?
There's a difference,

2010
01:41:42,731 --> 01:41:47,731
and then what's really bizarre is those 
people in that village might be happier 

2011
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:50,670
than the people live in a gated 
community in beverly hills.

2012
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:55,890
I wanted to.
I wanted to come back to your point 

2013
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:55,890
about about whether we should

2014
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:57,540
concentrating on what you're doing right
versus what you're doing wrong.

2015
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:03,440
Both of those will work and you should 
actually be doing both of them 

2016
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:03,440
simultaneously.
You'll,

2017
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:08,030
you'll maximize faster,
but the real problem is that the system 

2018
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:10,830
in which we concentrate on what you're 
doing right,

2019
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:15,880
what you're doing wrong,
and supposedly you get paid for some 

2020
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:18,810
integration of those things,
is that we don't,

2021
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:23,340
we don't understand what we are wired to
produce evolutionarily,

2022
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,520
right?
We think we all operate based on the 

2023
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:31,461
idea that we're pursuing some state of 
happiness or satisfaction and,

2024
01:42:31,831 --> 01:42:32,270
you know,
we,

2025
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:37,330
we think we know what's going to get it 
for us and maybe it's inventing 

2026
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:38,400
something and then you'll be happy.
Uh,

2027
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:42,000
but it's a trap.
The fact is,

2028
01:42:42,001 --> 01:42:47,001
what we are wired to do is to discover 
opportunities and then when we discover 

2029
01:42:47,191 --> 01:42:52,191
an opportunity,
it benefits the population that we come 

2030
01:42:52,191 --> 01:42:54,681
from and we turn that discovery into 
either more mouths to feed or more 

2031
01:42:55,051 --> 01:42:55,770
consumption.

2032
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:59,070
And we restore the state of privation,
right?

2033
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,680
We restore the state in which people 
don't have enough.

2034
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:05,100
And so if you really wanted to fix this 
problem,

2035
01:43:05,101 --> 01:43:09,120
if you want it to address the problems 
that communism thinks it's solving,

2036
01:43:09,121 --> 01:43:13,410
but fails to,
you have to engineer around this,

2037
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:18,710
uh,
this feature of human beings where we 

2038
01:43:18,710 --> 01:43:19,860
pursue new opportunities and as soon as 
we find a new opportunity,

2039
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:24,861
instead of figuring out a way to 
stabilize the benefits so that it 

2040
01:43:24,861 --> 01:43:26,130
results in a stable sense of 
satisfaction,

2041
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:31,400
for example,
we fall all over ourselves to turn it 

2042
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,340
into more of the same because of course 
that's how we got here.

2043
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:34,070
Can you give me an example?
Which means us,

2044
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,980
I'm sure.
So let's look at a,

2045
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:41,370
something like the,
um,

2046
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:46,870
let's imagine an an ancient farmer.
Ancient farmer has a piece of land and 

2047
01:43:47,431 --> 01:43:52,431
that piece of land will support a 
certain number of people with the level 

2048
01:43:52,431 --> 01:43:53,270
of technology that the farmer is 
utilizing.

2049
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:58,690
Somehow the farmer ends up either 
thinking of or discovering by watching 

2050
01:43:58,690 --> 01:44:03,611
somebody else a wheel.
Now that farmer has a technology that 

2051
01:44:03,611 --> 01:44:08,021
allows him or however many people are 
working that farm to produce that much 

2052
01:44:08,021 --> 01:44:12,080
more food with no more labor because the
wheel allows you to transport more,

2053
01:44:12,081 --> 01:44:13,250
for example,
at one time.

2054
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:18,970
So now that same piece of land can 
support more people because it can be 

2055
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:22,631
more efficiently farmed.
That could be stabilized as a kind of 

2056
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,400
success.
In other words,

2057
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:28,130
you could turn the extra,
um,

2058
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:33,670
the surplus into a kind of persistent,
a luxury,

2059
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,510
a luxury,
but I mean I don't even,

2060
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:39,470
luxury is a little bit too trivial sound
and you could turn it into a space where

2061
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,450
you use that to,
uh,

2062
01:44:41,451 --> 01:44:46,451
to investigate important stuff or you 
could turn it into more mouths to feed,

2063
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,000
in which case as soon as you've produced
those extra mouths that are now 

2064
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:52,700
consuming the output of that farm.

2065
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:55,030
Now the level of,
um,

2066
01:44:55,100 --> 01:45:00,100
you know,
fear of starvation is right back where 

2067
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:00,100
it was.
And so,

2068
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:00,440
uh,
so,

2069
01:45:00,441 --> 01:45:02,090
so that's more money,
more problems.

2070
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:03,200
Uh,
yeah,

2071
01:45:03,201 --> 01:45:03,980
essentially,
I mean,

2072
01:45:03,981 --> 01:45:04,400
you know,
well,

2073
01:45:04,401 --> 01:45:09,401
it used to be that we produced more 
people now will produce a greater quest 

2074
01:45:09,401 --> 01:45:11,870
for consumption,
but if we were smart,

2075
01:45:11,871 --> 01:45:15,290
what we would do is we would think about
the problem of how to take,

2076
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:20,770
uh,
the gains that come from not being 

2077
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:23,000
bumped up at the limits of a system and 
turn them into what we value,

2078
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:25,430
what we collectively can.
We've done some of that.

2079
01:45:25,431 --> 01:45:25,650
I mean,

2080
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:29,870
because,
so we've done some of that because as,

2081
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:35,390
what do they say?
A rising tide lifts all ships.

2082
01:45:35,391 --> 01:45:36,770
And there's certainly some truth in 
that.

2083
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:38,570
The overall standard of living has gone 
up.

2084
01:45:38,571 --> 01:45:40,760
So stupendously since 18,
95,

2085
01:45:40,761 --> 01:45:42,800
that it's an absolute miracle.
So we've,

2086
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:45,680
we've done some of that.
So there's another issue.

2087
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:51,010
Back to mark's.
Let's say there's another issue that we 

2088
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:51,010
have,
we can't contend with,

2089
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:53,990
and one of those might be,
well,

2090
01:45:53,991 --> 01:45:56,660
imagine that in order for society to 
progress,

2091
01:45:56,661 --> 01:46:01,661
you have to allow the individual to 
compete in a relatively untrammeled 

2092
01:46:01,661 --> 01:46:05,141
space so that they can innovate.
And then imagine that one of the 

2093
01:46:05,141 --> 01:46:08,651
consequences of that innovation is that 
you get these prieto distributions 

2094
01:46:08,651 --> 01:46:12,101
developing because the innovator or or 
the one who's second in line to the 

2095
01:46:12,101 --> 01:46:12,710
innovator,
whatever ends up with the,

2096
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:17,890
with the bulk of the spoils.
So you might say there's a cost to be 

2097
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:22,571
paid in inequality for innovation.
And then you could also say,

2098
01:46:23,421 --> 01:46:25,760
well,
too much inequality destabilizes things,

2099
01:46:25,761 --> 01:46:30,761
which seems to be quite quite clear.
So there's room for an intelligent 

2100
01:46:30,761 --> 01:46:31,370
conversation about that,
right?

2101
01:46:31,371 --> 01:46:33,260
Because the lefties say,
oh,

2102
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:38,320
too much inequality and they need to be 
listened to because the evidence is 

2103
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:41,651
quite clear.
If you let the inequality ramp up 

2104
01:46:41,651 --> 01:46:43,781
enough,
the whole system destabilizes because 

2105
01:46:43,781 --> 01:46:43,781
the people at the bottom think,
fuck it,

2106
01:46:43,781 --> 01:46:45,710
we'll just,
we'll just flip the system upside down.

2107
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:51,100
No one wants that.
Like right wing conservatives don't 

2108
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:51,100
that.
So because you

2109
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:51,540
could make a republican argument and 
say,

2110
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:54,810
don't let the inequality in your 
neighborhood get out of hand because the

2111
01:46:54,811 --> 01:46:59,811
crime rate will skyrocket.
And the empirical evidence on that is 

2112
01:46:59,811 --> 01:47:00,870
overwhelmingly strong.
Inequality drives crime.

2113
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:03,180
Now you can say,
you can argue about why,

2114
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:05,550
but the fact that it does,
that's not disputable,

2115
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:10,820
so we can have an intelligent discussion
between the left and the right and the 

2116
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:12,240
discussion would go something like this.
You need innovation,

2117
01:47:12,241 --> 01:47:17,241
you pay for innovation with inequality,
but you need to bind inequality because 

2118
01:47:17,241 --> 01:47:18,420
if it's too intense,
then things destabilize.

2119
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:19,080
It's like,
okay,

2120
01:47:19,081 --> 01:47:21,120
we can agree on that.
We've got the parameters set.

2121
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:26,420
Now we have to.
Now we have to start thinking very 

2122
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,881
carefully through how to do the 
redistribution issue and we don't know 

2123
01:47:28,881 --> 01:47:28,881
how to do that.
So you might say,

2124
01:47:28,881 --> 01:47:30,690
well we have a guaranteed annual income 
for people,

2125
01:47:30,691 --> 01:47:32,700
which I think is a horrible solution by 
the way,

2126
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,500
but it addresses the right problem.

2127
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:37,500
The problem is is that we're hyper 
productive,

2128
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:42,740
but the spoils go to those at the top 
and some of those resources need to be 

2129
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:46,500
funneled down to the people who have 
zero so that they have an opportunity to

2130
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:48,150
at least get to the point where they can
innovate.

2131
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:51,000
And so the bloody whole bloody thing 
doesn't wobble and fall.

2132
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:56,480
And we could we,
and I would say in some sense that's 

2133
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:56,480
what the political discussion is about,
but we,

2134
01:47:56,670 --> 01:48:01,670
we've,
we've skittered off into these radical 

2135
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:01,670
oversimplifications,
which is something like,

2136
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:03,270
well,
if you have more than another person,

2137
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:06,900
you're an oppressor and you're evil,
and if you have less,

2138
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:10,740
it's because you virtuous and victimized
and that's just a nonstarter.

2139
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:15,770
So you think that there's a real problem
with something like a universal basic 

2140
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:16,460
income?
I think it's a horrible idea.

2141
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:21,860
Well,
I think the idea that the solution is a 

2142
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:23,310
basic income is not a good idea because 
I think the problem is deeper than that.

2143
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:26,850
I don't think the fundamental problem is
that people don't have enough money.

2144
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:32,010
I think the fundamental problem is that 
human beings in some sense are beasts of

2145
01:48:32,011 --> 01:48:34,050
burden.
And if they're not given,

2146
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:39,500
if they're not provided with a place 
where they can accept social 

2147
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,350
responsibility,
social and individual responsibility and

2148
01:48:40,351 --> 01:48:43,290
an honorable manner,
they degenerate and die.

2149
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:46,350
That's the opiate crisis in the West 
right now.

2150
01:48:46,351 --> 01:48:51,000
Like men need men who are.
Men Don't need money.

2151
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:54,210
They need function and we've got a 
problem.

2152
01:48:54,211 --> 01:48:55,980
One of the problems is,
for example here,

2153
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:58,440
here's an ugly stat,
I think I told you this once before,

2154
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:04,190
it's illegal to induct anyone into the 
armed forces if they have an Iq of less 

2155
01:49:04,190 --> 01:49:06,840
than 83,
and the reason for that is the the armed

2156
01:49:06,841 --> 01:49:11,841
forces,
despite having every reason to draw the 

2157
01:49:11,841 --> 01:49:14,640
contradictory conclusions has decided 
that there isn't a single thing that you

2158
01:49:14,641 --> 01:49:16,260
can be trained to do in the military.

2159
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:20,040
If you have an Iq of less than 83,
that isn't positively counterproductive.

2160
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:25,820
That's 10 percent of the population and 
we're producing a culture that's very 

2161
01:49:26,431 --> 01:49:29,340
cognitively complex like,
what the hell are you going to do if you

2162
01:49:29,341 --> 01:49:32,010
can't use a computer?
Like if you can use a computer,

2163
01:49:32,011 --> 01:49:37,011
you're at least in the game.
If you can really use when you're hyper 

2164
01:49:37,011 --> 01:49:39,681
powerful.
If you're not literate enough to use a 

2165
01:49:39,681 --> 01:49:40,620
computer,
you're at 0:10

2166
01:49:40,621 --> 01:49:42,420
percent of the population.
The Conservatives say,

2167
01:49:42,421 --> 01:49:43,920
well,
there's a job for everyone.

2168
01:49:43,921 --> 01:49:48,550
If they just worked hard enough.
It's like a no and increasingly

2169
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:50,230
know and the liberals say,
well,

2170
01:49:50,231 --> 01:49:52,840
everyone's basically the same and you 
can train anyone to do anything.

2171
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:53,830
It's like,
no,

2172
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:55,400
you can't.
Yeah.

2173
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:00,760
I want to go back to the inequality 
point here because if you look at this 

2174
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:01,990
biologically,
actually I think it reveals a lot.

2175
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:04,210
Why are we,
I mean,

2176
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:09,211
we know from a,
from careful study that people are 

2177
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:13,330
motivated by the degree of inequality 
more than they are the,

2178
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:18,570
uh,
the absolute level of wellbeing that 

2179
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:18,570
they have.
And there's a very good,

2180
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:23,130
it's tragic,
but a very good evolutionary reason for 

2181
01:50:23,130 --> 01:50:25,501
this,
which is if you are working on some 

2182
01:50:25,501 --> 01:50:28,000
piece of land and your neighbor has the 
adjacent piece of land and they're doing

2183
01:50:28,001 --> 01:50:33,001
twice as well as you,
it's because they know something you 

2184
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:33,001
don't.
Right?

2185
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:37,200
And so becoming focused on what they're 
doing that you're not doing is a 

2186
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:41,761
rational thing to spend your time on so 
you can figure out what it is that they 

2187
01:50:41,761 --> 01:50:41,761
know that you don't.

2188
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:46,800
In the modern environment,
this is a catastrophe because who are 

2189
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:46,800
your neighbors?
Well,

2190
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,360
you've got some box sitting on the wall 
of your living room that has a totally 

2191
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:54,700
artificial portrait of other people who 
may be much wealthier than you.

2192
01:50:54,970 --> 01:50:59,970
And it's broadcasting in as if you're 
looking in their window right in the 

2193
01:50:59,970 --> 01:51:01,270
adjacent house,
and so you think you being triggered to,

2194
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:06,390
to think that you're doing something 
wrong that you might fix when in fact 

2195
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:06,640
the solution may not be,
first of all,

2196
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:10,120
the person on the other side of that 
screen may not be for real.

2197
01:51:11,050 --> 01:51:16,050
But even if they are,
if they're not living in the same 

2198
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:16,360
environment as you,
the technology is interfacing with,

2199
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:18,940
uh,
with our brains badly.

2200
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:23,890
But so we have the perception of massive
inequality economically,

2201
01:51:23,891 --> 01:51:27,700
we do have massive inequality.
You're arguing that the solution to this

2202
01:51:27,701 --> 01:51:32,220
involves some sort of massive 
redistribution plus our solution.

2203
01:51:33,070 --> 01:51:38,070
But nonetheless,
redistribution is wildly unpopular for 

2204
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:41,791
various reasons.
And so what we've got now is a 

2205
01:51:41,791 --> 01:51:43,960
situation.
This is speculative,

2206
01:51:43,961 --> 01:51:48,961
but what's really happening is that 
austerity is being used as a threat to 

2207
01:51:48,961 --> 01:51:52,030
keep people who would otherwise rebel 
against the inequality in line.

2208
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:57,400
And my fear about this is that this is 
exactly the conditions that are going to

2209
01:51:57,401 --> 01:52:02,401
trigger that a tribal population against
population may ham that we were talking 

2210
01:52:05,621 --> 01:52:07,330
about at the beginning of this 
conversation,

2211
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:12,690
that when people have the sense that the
the burst of growth that they were 

2212
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:16,930
experiencing is now over,
the natural response is to turn on those

2213
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:19,120
who are not as powerful and take their 
stuff,

2214
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:24,570
that this is a totally indefensible,
but nonetheless biological pattern of 

2215
01:52:24,570 --> 01:52:26,890
history and that if we want to avoid 
that,

2216
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:32,310
we have to stop sending the signals that
trigger us to imagine that we've just 

2217
01:52:32,321 --> 01:52:37,321
run to the limit of the opportunity that
we had discovered and it is now time to 

2218
01:52:37,361 --> 01:52:39,370
look and see who can't defend their 
position.

2219
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:41,080
How are we sending these signals?
Well,

2220
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:46,100
by basically failing to provide

2221
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:51,310
enough wellbeing that people's 
perception of the inequality is reduced 

2222
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:56,801
to a tolerable level.
What's the argument for universal basic 

2223
01:52:56,801 --> 01:52:56,801
income?
Right?

2224
01:52:56,801 --> 01:52:58,100
Certainly,
certainly a strong one.

2225
01:52:58,101 --> 01:52:58,670
And I,
you know,

2226
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:04,160
it's also,
it's also a good argument for equality 

2227
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:04,160
of opportunity,
right?

2228
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:07,841
Because people are.
People are actually not as resentful 

2229
01:53:07,841 --> 01:53:09,800
about the success of others as you might
expect.

2230
01:53:10,190 --> 01:53:13,400
They're resentful about it if they feel 
that the game is fixed,

2231
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:16,190
but they're also willing to consider the
game long term.

2232
01:53:16,191 --> 01:53:19,370
So lots of people will say,
look like I'm stuck at zero,

2233
01:53:19,371 --> 01:53:24,371
I'm stuck at one,
but my kids might make it to four and 

2234
01:53:24,371 --> 01:53:25,130
that's good enough.
And that's been the American dream.

2235
01:53:25,131 --> 01:53:25,890
Right?
And that's,

2236
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:29,240
and that's a really high power antidote 
to inequality.

2237
01:53:29,241 --> 01:53:30,020
It's like,
well,

2238
01:53:30,021 --> 01:53:31,790
yeah,
there's some inequality.

2239
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:34,280
We need it to keep the generative 
mechanism going,

2240
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,440
but the game is fair and you can play it
too.

2241
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:39,590
And there's some reasonable probability 
that either you or someone you love will

2242
01:53:39,591 --> 01:53:43,730
be successful so that it has to be a 
straight game.

2243
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,790
And that's why ethics is so important to
keep this landscape stable.

2244
01:53:46,791 --> 01:53:51,791
People can't play crooked games and the 
rich shouldn't be fixing the game if 

2245
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:52,790
they want to hold onto their money.
And the problem is,

2246
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:55,580
is that some of them,
although not all,

2247
01:53:55,730 --> 01:54:00,470
some of them are fixing the game and no 
one's happy about that and no wonder,

2248
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:01,070
you know.
And,

2249
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:06,450
and I guess that was evidenced to some 
degree by the 2008 collapse because it 

2250
01:54:06,471 --> 01:54:11,471
seemed and,
and I'm just as uninformed as the next 

2251
01:54:11,931 --> 01:54:12,770
person,
so I'm,

2252
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:16,070
I'm what I'm capable of commenting on 
this.

2253
01:54:16,071 --> 01:54:21,071
It seems from the outside that the rich 
disproportionately benefited from the 

2254
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:26,081
restabilize,
the economic system and people are not 

2255
01:54:26,081 --> 01:54:29,711
happy about that and they shouldn't be 
happy about that because it indicates 

2256
01:54:29,711 --> 01:54:30,050
that there's something fundamentally 
rotten about the game.

2257
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:31,220
So you could say,
well,

2258
01:54:31,221 --> 01:54:34,850
maybe people can tolerate necessary 
inequality if the game isn't raped.

2259
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:38,390
And so that's why everybody has to act 
in a manner that indicates that the game

2260
01:54:38,391 --> 01:54:40,550
isn't rigged and that means they can't 
rake it.

2261
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:45,551
That's really what it means.
So and so we're also being driven into 

2262
01:54:45,551 --> 01:54:50,441
this inequality cornered by,
I would say by the postmodernists and 

2263
01:54:50,441 --> 01:54:52,910
the neo Marxist because they say this is
the pernicious thing.

2264
01:54:52,911 --> 01:54:53,600
They say,
well,

2265
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:58,900
the reason that some people have more 
than others is because every hierarchy 

2266
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:01,190
is based on arbitrary power and they're 
all oppressors.

2267
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:04,880
And the reason they have the money is 
because they stoled it from you.

2268
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:08,960
And there's some truth in that because 
there are some criminals,

2269
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:14,290
but when you get to the point where you 
fail to distinguish the productive 

2270
01:55:14,290 --> 01:55:15,470
people from the criminals,
which is exactly what happened in the 19

2271
01:55:15,471 --> 01:55:20,471
twenties in the Soviet Union,
you better bloody well what watch out 

2272
01:55:20,471 --> 01:55:22,460
because when you radically make things 
egalitarian,

2273
01:55:22,461 --> 01:55:27,461
you're gonna wipe out all your 
productive people and then you're going 

2274
01:55:27,461 --> 01:55:30,441
to starve.
And so that's one of the doom and 

2275
01:55:30,441 --> 01:55:34,931
scenarios that awaits us if this idiot 
process of polarization continues and 

2276
01:55:34,931 --> 01:55:38,480
what I find reprehensible about the 
universities and you're tangled up right

2277
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:43,481
up to your neck in this,
is that the universities are actively 

2278
01:55:43,481 --> 01:55:47,500
agitating,
produce people who believe that all 

2279
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:47,640
inequality is due to oppression and 
power.

2280
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:49,740
And that's just.
Well,

2281
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,600
first of all,
it's technically wrong,

2282
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,740
but you guys

2283
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,790
both operate in that system so.
Well.

2284
01:55:58,380 --> 01:56:00,150
Here's the problem.
No,

2285
01:56:00,151 --> 01:56:01,530
I.
As far as I know,

2286
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:06,620
nobody has properly studied the question
of what fraction of the economy is 

2287
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:09,690
actually crooked.
Rent seeking,

2288
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:11,340
right?
Not Productive.

2289
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:15,150
And I fear that.
The answer to that question is that it's

2290
01:56:15,151 --> 01:56:20,151
an awful large fraction of the economy,
not because of some conspiracy,

2291
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:25,470
but because opportunity is finite,
but con games aren't,

2292
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:30,920
and so anybody who can find a mechanism 
for transferring wealth from somebody 

2293
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:35,301
else for doing nothing finds that 
mechanism and that thing is is ever 

2294
01:56:35,301 --> 01:56:38,871
present.
Whereas discovering the next big thing 

2295
01:56:38,871 --> 01:56:41,220
that's actually productive is something 
that goes along and fits and starts,

2296
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:43,980
and so if we were.
I mean really,

2297
01:56:43,990 --> 01:56:48,990
you've described it very well.
We've got a battle between two 

2298
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:53,840
characatures of what's true,
right are the either the market is 

2299
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:58,131
wonderful and it's producing great stuff
with very little corruption or 

2300
01:56:58,131 --> 01:57:01,200
everything that makes people on equal is
the result of corruption.

2301
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:03,090
Both of these things are wrong,
right?

2302
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:08,750
Markets are marvelous engines for 
figuring out how to do something really 

2303
01:57:09,601 --> 01:57:11,280
well.
They're brilliant at this,

2304
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:16,310
right,
and so people who see that fall in love 

2305
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:18,561
with it,
understandably because they're so good 

2306
01:57:18,561 --> 01:57:20,421
at it,
but what they're terrible at is telling 

2307
01:57:20,421 --> 01:57:20,421
you what you should want or what you 
should do,

2308
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,680
right?
If people tell markets,

2309
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:26,010
here's what we would like to accomplish,
and then the markets tell us,

2310
01:57:26,011 --> 01:57:27,900
well,
how do we accomplish that best?

2311
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:32,990
That would be a very viable system that 
would not result in massive rent 

2312
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:37,671
seeking,
resulting in everybody feeling that all 

2313
01:57:37,671 --> 01:57:37,671
of their misfortunes are the result of a
rigged game,

2314
01:57:37,671 --> 01:57:39,900
which is so massively rigged that when 
they check,

2315
01:57:39,901 --> 01:57:40,710
they see,
yes,

2316
01:57:40,711 --> 01:57:44,580
that is actually large to large extent 
what we're suffering from.

2317
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:46,920
Um,
but they want to throw the baby out with

2318
01:57:46,921 --> 01:57:51,921
the bathwater.
And so they want to throw out markets 

2319
01:57:51,921 --> 01:57:51,921
entirely,
which you know,

2320
01:57:51,921 --> 01:57:52,320
would be a terrible mistake.

2321
01:57:55,390 --> 01:57:56,190
It's,
it's a.

2322
01:57:58,230 --> 01:58:03,230
You asked you why,
why this has happened in the 

2323
01:58:03,230 --> 01:58:05,431
universities and like that.
I think it's one of these runaway 

2324
01:58:05,431 --> 01:58:06,340
positive feedback processes,
you know,

2325
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:11,400
the universities start to tilt hard to 
the left in the sixties and that just 

2326
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:15,600
went out of control.
And now we're at the point where that's 

2327
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:19,171
the dominant force.
And why is probably another 

2328
01:58:19,171 --> 01:58:21,070
manifestation of one of these prieto 
principals.

2329
01:58:21,071 --> 01:58:22,090
It was like,
well,

2330
01:58:22,091 --> 01:58:27,091
at some point there's enough lefties 
hired so that the probability that 

2331
01:58:27,091 --> 01:58:30,901
they're only going to hire people 
equally as left or greater starts to 

2332
01:58:30,901 --> 01:58:34,411
reach 100 percent and then you iterate 
that across a couple of generations and 

2333
01:58:34,411 --> 01:58:38,700
you get no conservatives,
which is more or less the situation say 

2334
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:40,660
in the humanities and most of the social
sciences and it sort of looks like a,

2335
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:44,050
but it doesn't mean that anyone is 
actually planning it.

2336
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:47,470
Although there are conscious attempts 
also to silence conservative voices,

2337
01:58:47,471 --> 01:58:52,471
let's say.
And then that's also driven by this 

2338
01:58:52,471 --> 01:58:55,021
postmodern ethos.
No Neo Marxist ethos I would say that 

2339
01:58:55,021 --> 01:58:58,591
says that all of the right,
the moral right is on the side of the 

2340
01:58:58,591 --> 01:58:58,591
left.
You know,

2341
01:58:58,591 --> 01:59:00,490
and so it's the combination of those two
things.

2342
01:59:00,491 --> 01:59:03,580
There's more things.
I think I often think comically,

2343
01:59:03,581 --> 01:59:08,410
that if you paid sociology professors 
three times as much,

2344
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:13,830
the probability that they would be 
anticapitalist would decline 

2345
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:16,861
precipitously.
Like I think a lot of it's driven 

2346
01:59:16,861 --> 01:59:19,480
because there's a lot of smart people in
academia and they're underpaid relative 

2347
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:22,180
to their intelligence,
so in that doesn't make them happy.

2348
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:24,850
So they get bitter and resentful about 
that and they think,

2349
01:59:24,851 --> 01:59:28,090
well there's these goddamn bankers who 
are hauling in $20,000,000

2350
01:59:28,091 --> 01:59:33,091
a year and here I am hardly struggling,
but here I am struggling comparatively 

2351
01:59:33,731 --> 01:59:37,120
and that's the issue is comparatively on
$100,000

2352
01:59:37,121 --> 01:59:38,620
a year,
$120,000

2353
01:59:38,621 --> 01:59:39,070
a year.

2354
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,810
You know,
I look at that and I think,

2355
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:43,540
well whatever,
it doesn't matter,

2356
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:48,780
but there's a,
like my colleagues are often angry with 

2357
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:48,850
me because I do work with the business 
school,

2358
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:51,100
you know,
and I also have a business,

2359
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:56,101
I'm not anticapitalist in the least,
but I just dumbfounding to me because 

2360
01:59:56,531 --> 02:00:01,531
they'll come up to me and say,
well are you so sure that you should be 

2361
02:00:01,531 --> 02:00:03,841
working with the business school?
And I think what bloody planet are you 

2362
02:00:03,841 --> 02:00:05,830
from two to positive question.
Like that's all businessmen are evil.

2363
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:06,730
It's like,
really?

2364
02:00:06,970 --> 02:00:11,970
That's the level of sophistication.
That is really an argument that's been 

2365
02:00:11,970 --> 02:00:12,760
presented to you that businessmen are 
evil.

2366
02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:18,090
Well they don't come out and say that,
but they certainly questioned my 

2367
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:18,090
motivations.
For example,

2368
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:22,201
in,
in informing ties with the business 

2369
02:00:22,201 --> 02:00:22,201
school.
Like what do they say about it?

2370
02:00:22,201 --> 02:00:26,160
They say exactly that.
They questioned my ethics about forming 

2371
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:29,161
ties with the business school.
So because they don't give you any 

2372
02:00:29,161 --> 02:00:32,431
reasons for you're supposed to it.
The reason is supposed to be self 

2373
02:00:32,431 --> 02:00:33,880
evident Joe.
So let's give this.

2374
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:35,000
I mean it's do.
I mean I,

2375
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:37,990
I don't buy this argument but,
but nonetheless,

2376
02:00:37,991 --> 02:00:38,950
let's,
let's not,

2377
02:00:39,370 --> 02:00:40,630
let's not caricature.
Yes,

2378
02:00:40,631 --> 02:00:44,950
that's good.
In an absolutely free market,

2379
02:00:44,951 --> 02:00:48,430
which is not what we have,
but we have something that tends in that

2380
02:00:48,431 --> 02:00:53,431
direction in an absolutely free market.
If you compete to individuals,

2381
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:57,790
one of whom is completely amoral,
will embrace any opportunity.

2382
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:59,860
If it makes a profit no matter what it 
is,

2383
02:00:59,861 --> 02:01:02,440
and the other individual has some limit 
to what they will do.

2384
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,500
Well then there's no question.
Who Wins?

2385
02:01:05,501 --> 02:01:08,380
If we give this experiment a long enough
period,

2386
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:13,680
the individual who will do anything will
outcompete the individual with moral 

2387
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:14,860
limits because depending on what the 
game is though,

2388
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:17,920
because people find out that you have no
moral limits,

2389
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:21,220
then they're going to remove themselves 
from your market.

2390
02:01:21,221 --> 02:01:23,330
Unfortunately not.
And here's the.

2391
02:01:23,410 --> 02:01:24,800
I know it seems like that and in,
in,

2392
02:01:24,801 --> 02:01:27,130
in any given round,
that's true,

2393
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:32,700
but to the extent that what you're 
saying is to the extent that people 

2394
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:33,700
police,
um,

2395
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:35,800
their purchasing and they will,
you know,

2396
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:36,940
they will stop using uber.

2397
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:40,160
If Uber is ethically compromised,
for example,

2398
02:01:40,570 --> 02:01:41,900
um,
well then the point is,

2399
02:01:41,901 --> 02:01:42,710
well,
what's the game?

2400
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:47,740
The game is to figure out which things 
are being monitored and not do any of 

2401
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:49,850
the unethical things that are being 
monitored,

2402
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:52,460
but to do all of the unethical things 
that aren't being monitored.

2403
02:01:52,461 --> 02:01:57,461
And so the individual who is perceiving 
which things they can get away with has 

2404
02:01:57,461 --> 02:02:00,350
an advantage and a psychopath advantage.
Well,

2405
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:02,840
I don't even want to call it the 
psychopath advantage,

2406
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:04,340
right?
What this is,

2407
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:09,341
is that a market will train you to do 
this if it is unregulated and the best 

2408
02:02:09,951 --> 02:02:14,951
that the ethical that the ethically I'm 
restrained person can do is compete dead

2409
02:02:17,001 --> 02:02:22,001
even they have no way of getting ahead 
because the person that is completely 

2410
02:02:22,001 --> 02:02:25,421
free,
the amoral business actor has the 

2411
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:29,651
ability to do anything that the 
constrained actor has just depend 

2412
02:02:29,651 --> 02:02:31,970
entirely upon what the battlefield is 
not really.

2413
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:37,050
There's sort of one exception and that 
exception is people who have done 

2414
02:02:37,050 --> 02:02:38,120
something,
uh,

2415
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:42,080
that has suddenly put them in a powerful
position,

2416
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:43,040
right?
So,

2417
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:48,340
um,
I don't whack people tech people who 

2418
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:51,131
have skyrocketed as a result of having 
innovated the next big thing have not 

2419
02:02:51,131 --> 02:02:54,650
been through the markets,
training them to discover the,

2420
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:57,800
the landscape of what isn't being 
monitored,

2421
02:02:57,801 --> 02:03:02,801
that you can make a profit.
That's one of the fascinating things 

2422
02:03:02,801 --> 02:03:03,410
about tech people in general,
is that these gigantic tech corporations

2423
02:03:03,411 --> 02:03:05,240
almost all leaned left.
Well,

2424
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:07,220
the gigantic tech corporations lean 
left.

2425
02:03:07,221 --> 02:03:09,080
That's true.
On the other hand,

2426
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:11,300
I mean,
I hate to say it,

2427
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:13,130
but think about how Google started,
right?

2428
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:14,540
Don't,
don't be evil,

2429
02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:16,940
right?
I think they actually meant that,

2430
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:22,510
right,
and the thing is don't be evil is what 

2431
02:03:22,510 --> 02:03:23,450
it sounds like when you haven't been 
trained by the market to have,

2432
02:03:23,451 --> 02:03:26,270
to do whatever you have to do to beat 
your competition.

2433
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:29,240
You've just come up with the great 
search engine and suddenly you're on top

2434
02:03:29,241 --> 02:03:30,530
of the world.
Um,

2435
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:36,640
but over time what happens,
that entity is now exposed to 

2436
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:41,381
competition from a bunch of other 
entities that increasingly will find an 

2437
02:03:41,751 --> 02:03:45,950
advantage in being freer to do ethically
questionable stuff.

2438
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:51,080
And so what it does is it forces an 
entity like google to evolve in the 

2439
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:55,991
direction of a morality.
So now don't be evil with China and 

2440
02:03:55,991 --> 02:03:58,520
Google just to expand into China.
And so,

2441
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:00,560
you know,
they had to make a deal with the devil,

2442
02:04:00,561 --> 02:04:01,940
so to speak.
Right?

2443
02:04:01,941 --> 02:04:06,941
And they will have to accept censorship.
They will find ways to rationalize 

2444
02:04:06,941 --> 02:04:10,721
everything because to not rationalize 
that which their competitors can avail 

2445
02:04:10,721 --> 02:04:12,720
themselves of would be to perish.
And so the issues was a,

2446
02:04:12,721 --> 02:04:15,560
there was all sorts of fake google going
on,

2447
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:18,110
just like they have fake apple stores in
China.

2448
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:23,440
They don't have the same sort of 
copyright laws that we have and you can 

2449
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,080
essentially plagiarize anything you want
on Brett,

2450
02:04:25,110 --> 02:04:30,110
you.
You also said that I shouldn't make a 

2451
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:30,890
straw man of the antibusiness argument 
of my peers and there's another way that

2452
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:35,950
I shouldn't make a straw man of it.
Like despite the fact that I'm not 

2453
02:04:35,950 --> 02:04:38,160
anticapitalist.
I don't believe that every entity is

2454
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:43,160
a business either and one of the things 
that has happened to universities that 

2455
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:44,820
has actually been pathologized in a 
number of dimensions,

2456
02:04:44,821 --> 02:04:49,370
but they've also pathologize along the 
business dimension as the administrators

2457
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:54,380
have become increasingly trained or 
drawn from the ranks of business 

2458
02:04:54,380 --> 02:04:55,440
managers.
Because the university is actually not a

2459
02:04:55,441 --> 02:04:58,290
business.
It's a like a church isn't a business.

2460
02:04:58,291 --> 02:05:02,300
There are organizations that aren't 
businesses that you can't just cram into

2461
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:06,570
the free market structure Willy Nilly 
and so my colleagues also object to the,

2462
02:05:07,050 --> 02:05:10,230
to the transformation of the university,
into a business entity,

2463
02:05:10,231 --> 02:05:15,231
run by profit seeking Mbas,
and they should object to that because 

2464
02:05:15,231 --> 02:05:19,310
that's not what the institution is for.
So there are reasons for them to be 

2465
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:23,571
skeptical.
Say of my association with the business 

2466
02:05:23,571 --> 02:05:25,740
school that aren't merely a reflection 
of a simplistic anticapitalist etiology.

2467
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:26,760
Oh,
there are lots of,

2468
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:27,300
there are lots of

2469
02:05:27,410 --> 02:05:32,410
things that are not,
have no immunity to contact with the 

2470
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:33,180
market.
Right?

2471
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:36,620
What has happened to the university 
system is that markets have pushed it in

2472
02:05:36,621 --> 02:05:41,210
all kinds of directions that are not 
healthy for the mission of the academy.

2473
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:42,650
Um,
and this is also true,

2474
02:05:42,651 --> 02:05:44,840
you know,
journalism is well done in a market,

2475
02:05:44,841 --> 02:05:47,090
either write journalism done in the 
market,

2476
02:05:47,091 --> 02:05:48,440
ends up telling you what you want to 
hear,

2477
02:05:48,441 --> 02:05:49,890
not what you need to know.
Um,

2478
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:52,760
so anyway,
markets are wonderful,

2479
02:05:52,910 --> 02:05:57,910
but there are certain things they 
shouldn't be allowed to touch and there 

2480
02:05:57,910 --> 02:05:57,910
are certain things that they shouldn't 
do,

2481
02:05:57,910 --> 02:05:59,670
like tell us what to want right?
There not,

2482
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:04,010
there's no magic principle by which a 
market knows what's healthy and what,

2483
02:06:04,070 --> 02:06:04,930
you know,
you might

2484
02:06:05,290 --> 02:06:08,310
didn't have.
That also then brings us back to another

2485
02:06:08,311 --> 02:06:13,020
part of the conservative liberal left 
dilemma,

2486
02:06:13,410 --> 02:06:14,250
which is,
well,

2487
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:19,580
you know,
to direct the market means to impose the

2488
02:06:19,981 --> 02:06:23,460
heavy hand of the state and its 
potential pathologies on the market.

2489
02:06:23,461 --> 02:06:28,461
But to leave it alone completely means 
that it wanders randomly through a,

2490
02:06:28,860 --> 02:06:33,860
through an indeterminant landscape.
And I guess part of the issue there too 

2491
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:35,520
is it's sort of like,
well how do we,

2492
02:06:35,820 --> 02:06:40,110
how do we,
how do we properly balance for foresight

2493
02:06:40,111 --> 02:06:45,111
and planning,
which you'd think would have some role 

2494
02:06:45,111 --> 02:06:47,481
in,
in the construction of large scale 

2495
02:06:47,481 --> 02:06:47,481
states.
It's like,

2496
02:06:47,481 --> 02:06:50,090
well,
what do we want the landscape to look 

2497
02:06:50,090 --> 02:06:52,071
like?
How do we balance that with the sort of 

2498
02:06:52,071 --> 02:06:52,860
comprehensive computations that the 
market allows?

2499
02:06:52,861 --> 02:06:57,861
And of course the answer to that is we 
have political discussions about it all 

2500
02:06:57,861 --> 02:07:01,461
the time that are untrammeled so that we
can adjust the ratio between those two 

2501
02:07:01,461 --> 02:07:02,700
things as necessary.
So again,

2502
02:07:02,701 --> 02:07:03,470
that's a,
that's a,

2503
02:07:03,710 --> 02:07:06,120
that's a argument on the side of free 
speech.

2504
02:07:06,290 --> 02:07:07,940
I mean really it could,
couldn't be

2505
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:12,940
more important.
The real answer is that both failures 

2506
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:12,940
are frightening,
right?

2507
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:18,220
You really don't want a state,
a nannying you and overregulating the 

2508
02:07:18,411 --> 02:07:23,411
market and taking the magic out of it 
and you don't want the completely 

2509
02:07:23,411 --> 02:07:27,401
unregulated landscape where the market 
starts probing the minds of your 

2510
02:07:27,401 --> 02:07:28,100
children and figuring out how to sell 
them,

2511
02:07:28,101 --> 02:07:31,160
things that they don't have any ability 
to resist,

2512
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:34,400
right?
You need to figure out what that path is

2513
02:07:34,401 --> 02:07:35,530
and it's not,
but

2514
02:07:36,090 --> 02:07:41,090
you can't do it in a landscape where you
can't talk about the questions and this 

2515
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:41,090
brings us to censorship,
doesn't it?

2516
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:43,570
Because this is a real issue with the 
marketplace of free ideas.

2517
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:49,560
When you're talking about whether it's 
Google or youtube or whoever might be 

2518
02:07:49,721 --> 02:07:54,721
imposing their own morality and their 
own ideas on what you should and should 

2519
02:07:54,721 --> 02:07:56,530
not be able to discuss and what should 
and should not be monetized.

2520
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:01,960
You're.
You're essentially imposing these 

2521
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:02,140
limits.
These look,

2522
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:07,230
I've read once and it's a very good 
point that freedom breeds inequality 

2523
02:08:07,230 --> 02:08:12,180
because you're free to put as much 
effort as you'd like into something and 

2524
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:16,591
you're going to get an equal results and
that if you are truly free in a free 

2525
02:08:16,591 --> 02:08:21,061
world,
some people are going to do far better 

2526
02:08:21,061 --> 02:08:21,061
than others and just based on their own 
input,

2527
02:08:21,061 --> 02:08:23,220
just based on their effort,
just based on the.

2528
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:25,240
The amount of focus and dedication they 
have.

2529
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:27,220
It is very unequal.
You know,

2530
02:08:27,330 --> 02:08:32,330
I,
I know many people that are far more 

2531
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:32,740
dedicated than other people that I know 
and they do better.

2532
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:33,340
Yeah,
well that's,

2533
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:38,580
that's well buttressed by the empirical 
literature because while I mentioned 

2534
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:42,631
earlier that the two best predictors of 
longterm success or intelligence and 

2535
02:08:42,631 --> 02:08:46,590
conscientiousness and what intelligence 
is probably something like the number 

2536
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:51,241
of,
of credible operations that you can 

2537
02:08:51,241 --> 02:08:52,150
manifest in a given period of time.
It's something like speed now.

2538
02:08:52,151 --> 02:08:54,280
It's not only that but it speed's a big 
part of it.

2539
02:08:54,281 --> 02:08:57,850
So if what you're doing is working and 
you can do it faster,

2540
02:08:57,851 --> 02:08:59,040
that works better.
Okay.

2541
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:02,500
That's pretty damn straightforward.
And the next thing is,

2542
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:03,880
well,
conscientiousness,

2543
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:09,090
conscientiousness would be something 
like how many of those cycles of effort 

2544
02:09:09,090 --> 02:09:13,030
are devoted to that specific task and it
turns out that if there's a relationship

2545
02:09:13,031 --> 02:09:16,570
between the effort and task success,
more effort is better,

2546
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:20,440
but and so I can give you some 
indication of the power of that.

2547
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:23,200
So if you have good measures of 
conscientiousness in Icu,

2548
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:27,310
you can predict someone's success in a 
competitive landscape with a correlation

2549
02:09:27,311 --> 02:09:30,820
of about point six.
And what that would mean is imagine that

2550
02:09:30,821 --> 02:09:34,480
you tried to pick people,
you just said randomly,

2551
02:09:34,481 --> 02:09:38,050
you're going to be a success in the top 
half of the successful people say.

2552
02:09:38,051 --> 02:09:39,250
And you're going to be in the bottom 
half.

2553
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:40,430
You'd have a 50,
50,

2554
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:42,230
50 percent chance of,
of,

2555
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:45,670
of making that selection correctly.
If you did it randomly,

2556
02:09:46,450 --> 02:09:51,450
if you did it informed by the results of
a good cognitive test and a 

2557
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:53,020
conscientious test,
you'd be right 85 percent of the time.

2558
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:56,470
So you could say with 85 percent 
accurately accuracy,

2559
02:09:56,471 --> 02:10:00,100
which of two people would be more likely
to be in the top 50 percent.

2560
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:05,640
So it's a whopping effect and it's 
actually some validation for the 

2561
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:09,601
essential integrity of our system 
because we hope given that it's 

2562
02:10:09,601 --> 02:10:10,870
essentially an open meritocracy that 
smarter,

2563
02:10:10,871 --> 02:10:13,270
hardworking people would do better and 
they do.

2564
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:14,890
Now.
Other factors apply.

2565
02:10:15,070 --> 02:10:16,420
Corruption,
for example,

2566
02:10:16,421 --> 02:10:17,980
lots of factors apply.
I mean,

2567
02:10:17,981 --> 02:10:21,520
for one thing wrapped up in ICU is a big
question,

2568
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:26,580
which is how much of the differences in 
Iq that exist is democratized bubble.

2569
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:32,430
That is to say how much of this is the 
result of environments that aren't 

2570
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:36,310
enriching or there's lead the water or 
who knows what vitamins,

2571
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:37,060
right?
My,

2572
02:10:37,150 --> 02:10:42,150
my sense actually my intuition based on 
what I know biologically is that a huge 

2573
02:10:42,150 --> 02:10:42,920
fraction,
maybe all of it,

2574
02:10:42,921 --> 02:10:47,450
but a huge fraction of differences in Iq
is actually,

2575
02:10:47,710 --> 02:10:52,710
um,
could be generalized and that's part of 

2576
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:55,901
equal opportunity.
It's not an equal opportunity to see 

2577
02:10:55,901 --> 02:10:56,900
some mistake about that.
And that's partly because,

2578
02:10:57,710 --> 02:11:02,710
I mean maybe because I spent a lot of,
because I'm interested in the 

2579
02:11:02,710 --> 02:11:03,090
amelioration of differences,
you know,

2580
02:11:03,110 --> 02:11:05,360
so for example,
that's why I built this future authoring

2581
02:11:05,361 --> 02:11:05,840
program.

2582
02:11:06,050 --> 02:11:06,950
It's like,
Hey,

2583
02:11:06,951 --> 02:11:08,990
if we can figure out how to make people 
more effective,

2584
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:12,470
well let's do it.
So I scoured the literature on,

2585
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:15,590
on Iq enhancement and it's bloody 
dismal,

2586
02:11:15,591 --> 02:11:16,850
man.
It's rough.

2587
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:21,880
It's very,
very difficult to put together a 

2588
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:24,251
cognitive training program.
Like some things have worked in a major 

2589
02:11:24,251 --> 02:11:28,301
way.
Like the fact that people aren't 

2590
02:11:28,301 --> 02:11:28,301
starving,
has wiped out,

2591
02:11:28,301 --> 02:11:32,290
has moved the bottom of the ICU 
distribution way up over the last 

2592
02:11:32,290 --> 02:11:33,260
hundred years.
That's been like a walloping success.

2593
02:11:33,620 --> 02:11:38,620
But a lot of the things that we hope 
would work like headstart's a good 

2594
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:38,690
example of that,
you know,

2595
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:42,230
headstart was part of the American war 
on poverty and the idea was you'd give,

2596
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:43,930
you know,
deprived,

2597
02:11:44,490 --> 02:11:49,490
deprived kids lay up early before they 
hit school and start training them 

2598
02:11:50,331 --> 02:11:53,570
cognitively earlier.
And the hope was that you'd get a prieto

2599
02:11:53,571 --> 02:11:57,650
thing going where they'd be a little 
smarter in kindergarten and then they do

2600
02:11:57,651 --> 02:12:02,651
a little better in grade one and that 
would make them do even more better in 

2601
02:12:02,651 --> 02:12:02,651
grade two.

2602
02:12:02,651 --> 02:12:03,680
More better,
do better in grade two.

2603
02:12:03,890 --> 02:12:07,970
But what happened,
what happened was that the kids who went

2604
02:12:07,971 --> 02:12:11,330
through headstart actually did get a 
cognitive jump on their competitors,

2605
02:12:11,331 --> 02:12:14,300
but all the other kids caught up by 
grade six and by grade six,

2606
02:12:14,301 --> 02:12:17,960
there was absolutely no effect 
whatsoever of the training program left.

2607
02:12:18,290 --> 02:12:20,630
Now,
headstart did have a couple of benefits.

2608
02:12:20,631 --> 02:12:24,290
One was fewer teenage pregnancies and 
fewer dropouts,

2609
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:29,470
but that was probably because the kids 
who got into headstart were either 

2610
02:12:29,470 --> 02:12:33,461
socialize better or that some fraction 
of them were removed from for some time 

2611
02:12:33,591 --> 02:12:36,620
from extremely toxic environments just.
Well,

2612
02:12:36,621 --> 02:12:41,621
they happen to be at headstart,
but it didn't produce the cognitive 

2613
02:12:41,621 --> 02:12:43,310
improvements that everyone right and 
left were equally hoping for.

2614
02:12:43,430 --> 02:12:44,180
Yeah.
But this is,

2615
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:49,420
this is in some sense a,
it's a very much an uncontrolled 

2616
02:12:49,420 --> 02:12:49,750
experiment,
right?

2617
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,910
Because a headstart starts late.
Yep.

2618
02:12:53,030 --> 02:12:58,030
And B,
it doesn't insulate you from all of the 

2619
02:12:58,030 --> 02:12:58,030
stuff that comes along with.

2620
02:12:58,030 --> 02:12:58,630
Oh yeah,
growing up in,

2621
02:12:58,631 --> 02:13:00,620
in the deprived neighborhood.
And so,

2622
02:13:00,621 --> 02:13:02,300
absolutely.
And now also,

2623
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:06,010
I don't know what the truth is of,
um,

2624
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:11,200
of Human Iq.
And there there are some results that 

2625
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:12,620
suggest some things that are not 
hopeful.

2626
02:13:12,621 --> 02:13:15,500
On the other hand,
some of them just simply run a foul with

2627
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:20,240
the biological realities of intelligent.
Well here,

2628
02:13:20,260 --> 02:13:23,840
here's a good example of of the,
of the lack of malleability.

2629
02:13:23,841 --> 02:13:26,660
I mean there's a couple of things.
The first is that we may have already,

2630
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:32,020
we may already be at a point of 
diminishing returns in terms of 

2631
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:32,020
eliminating

2632
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,640
individual differences in Iq because 
everyone has central heating,

2633
02:13:35,641 --> 02:13:37,920
everyone has air conditioning,
everyone has enough food,

2634
02:13:37,921 --> 02:13:40,920
everyone has access to the.
An infinite pool of information.

2635
02:13:41,190 --> 02:13:43,860
So you can say even if you're in a 
deprived environment,

2636
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:48,890
but you're smart,
the intellectual landscape is wide open 

2637
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:48,890
to you.
Now.

2638
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:50,460
I'm not saying that's the case,
but you can make a case for that.

2639
02:13:50,790 --> 02:13:55,790
But the more dismal end of the,
of the biological research on Iq shows 

2640
02:13:55,790 --> 02:14:00,291
things like if you take identical twins 
at birth and you put them in a adopted 

2641
02:14:00,871 --> 02:14:04,810
out families that the Iq of the adopted 
out twins as much there,

2642
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:09,630
much closer to the original biological 
parents than to the adoptive parents and

2643
02:14:09,631 --> 02:14:12,000
be almost perfectly correlated with one 
another.

2644
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:15,930
And that correlation increases as the 
separated twins' age.

2645
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:19,980
So let's say you had a twin,
you were both adopted out at birth.

2646
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:23,010
We test your Iq is at four.
They're fairly close.

2647
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:26,250
They're closer to your biological 
parents than your adoptive parents.

2648
02:14:26,251 --> 02:14:28,680
But then we test you every year until 
you're 60.

2649
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:31,980
By the time you're 60.
No matter how long you've been separated

2650
02:14:31,981 --> 02:14:32,500
as,
as,

2651
02:14:32,501 --> 02:14:33,810
uh,
an identical twin,

2652
02:14:34,290 --> 02:14:39,290
your Iq score is so much like your twins
Iq score that it's as if the same person

2653
02:14:39,571 --> 02:14:44,571
was being tested twice.
And that's a really complicated one 

2654
02:14:44,571 --> 02:14:44,571
because you think,
well,

2655
02:14:44,571 --> 02:14:49,430
as twins traveled through the 
environment and accrue different 

2656
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:51,540
experiences,
their ICU should diverge.

2657
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:55,020
Like obviously that's not what happens.
They converge.

2658
02:14:55,380 --> 02:15:00,380
So there,
there are a lot of places to critique 

2659
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:00,380
that.
For one thing,

2660
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:01,890
there aren't very many identical twins 
raised apart.

2661
02:15:01,891 --> 02:15:04,560
It's a small sample.
This is definitely true.

2662
02:15:04,590 --> 02:15:09,590
Those identical twins raised apart carry
with them whatever effects there were 

2663
02:15:10,381 --> 02:15:13,730
from before they were born,
for sure and the same.

2664
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,450
And so if,
if they,

2665
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:19,680
if they've been damaged by an 
environment that was unhealthy for their

2666
02:15:19,681 --> 02:15:24,681
mother when she was pregnant,
than they would carry that through and 

2667
02:15:24,681 --> 02:15:26,370
it would show up as a,
as a similar Iq later in life.

2668
02:15:26,371 --> 02:15:29,220
So that one really wants to see that 
this is true on the positive side,

2669
02:15:29,221 --> 02:15:31,440
not just the negative side.
So anyway,

2670
02:15:31,441 --> 02:15:36,441
there's,
I'm not saying that there's nothing to 

2671
02:15:36,441 --> 02:15:36,441
it.
I'm really saying I think we don't know.

2672
02:15:36,441 --> 02:15:37,650
It's very early in this,
but what I can say,

2673
02:15:37,651 --> 02:15:42,651
and I think a couple of the things that 
we've settled on in this conversation 

2674
02:15:42,651 --> 02:15:44,930
already are that a,
uh,

2675
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:50,000
an environment in which we can say 
anything that we can advance any 

2676
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,471
argument and tested.
It doesn't mean that that argument is 

2677
02:15:54,471 --> 02:15:56,961
protected,
but that any argument can be advanced 

2678
02:15:56,961 --> 02:15:57,780
and then challenged that that is 
inherent to navigating.

2679
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:02,780
And the other thing that I think we 
would agree on is that equality of 

2680
02:16:02,780 --> 02:16:04,720
opportunity is nothing but good,
right?

2681
02:16:04,730 --> 02:16:06,720
A fair game with equality of 
opportunity,

2682
02:16:06,721 --> 02:16:10,410
fair game with equality of opportunity.
And I guess one thing I would add,

2683
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:12,310
I don't know if we would agree on this,
but um,

2684
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:15,030
you were talking about the fact that,
uh,

2685
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:20,510
I forget which thing exactly but,
but that a system based on merit 

2686
02:16:20,510 --> 02:16:25,280
produces inequality because people will 
freedom that freedom produces 

2687
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:26,730
inequality.
That's not necessarily a bad thing,

2688
02:16:26,790 --> 02:16:29,320
but it doesn't mean that we are 
obligated to,

2689
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:29,860
to

2690
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,080
ride it all the way down.
Right?

2691
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:35,830
The fact is we could make people safe to
fail,

2692
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:39,250
right?
So that you are encouraged to attempt to

2693
02:16:39,251 --> 02:16:42,480
do something highly valuable.
And if you,

2694
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:46,900
if it doesn't work out,
then the point is you're not homeless.

2695
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:51,960
This would be the argument for something
like universal basic income that your 

2696
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:53,560
needs are taken care of,
your food,

2697
02:16:53,590 --> 02:16:58,590
your shelter,
and now you're free to pursue any ideas 

2698
02:16:58,590 --> 02:17:01,660
that you might have that you would 
ordinarily be saddled down by your,

2699
02:17:01,661 --> 02:17:05,140
your issues with food.
And there is some evidence of that.

2700
02:17:05,141 --> 02:17:10,141
Actually happening in Canada now,
these are multi variable problems and so

2701
02:17:10,481 --> 02:17:13,930
I'm not claiming that this is true,
but it's suggestive.

2702
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:19,500
The rate of entrepreneurial activity in 
Canada is actually higher than in the 

2703
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:24,300
United States and one reason for that 
appears to be the fact that if you're 

2704
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:25,120
25,
27,

2705
02:17:25,121 --> 02:17:26,590
let's say,
and you have a family,

2706
02:17:27,010 --> 02:17:32,010
you can quit your job and start a 
startup and you don't lose your 

2707
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:32,010
healthcare.

2708
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:33,980
Right?
And so now you know,

2709
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:38,050
the issue of universal health core is 
obviously a very thorny one and it's not

2710
02:17:38,051 --> 02:17:40,060
like the Canadian system works 
perfectly,

2711
02:17:40,061 --> 02:17:45,061
but it doesn't work too badly and we've 
been able to manage it for about 50 

2712
02:17:45,061 --> 02:17:45,061
years.
You know,

2713
02:17:45,061 --> 02:17:45,880
we have,
there's,

2714
02:17:45,970 --> 02:17:50,970
there's artificial scarcity in the 
system and the delay times are longer 

2715
02:17:50,970 --> 02:17:53,620
than they would be if you flew to the 
Mayo Clinic and bought your healthcare.

2716
02:17:53,650 --> 02:17:57,250
Like I would say that at the high end 
the American healthcare system is better

2717
02:17:57,251 --> 02:18:01,600
than the Canadian healthcare system,
but I would say at the middle and at the

2718
02:18:01,601 --> 02:18:06,601
low end,
the Canadian healthcare system is 

2719
02:18:06,601 --> 02:18:06,601
clearly preferable and it's also 
cheaper.

2720
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:09,070
Which is quite interesting because you 
would expect,

2721
02:18:09,071 --> 02:18:10,930
especially if you're a free market type 
that,

2722
02:18:11,460 --> 02:18:16,460
you know,
I know the healthcare system in the US 

2723
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:16,720
is not precisely free market,
but it is more so than it is in Canada,

2724
02:18:16,721 --> 02:18:21,721
yet Americans pay a substantially higher
proportion of their overall devote,

2725
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:27,211
a higher proportion of their overall GDP
to personal healthcare that Canadians 

2726
02:18:27,211 --> 02:18:27,211
do.

2727
02:18:27,211 --> 02:18:27,310
And,
and the stats are similar.

2728
02:18:27,311 --> 02:18:29,440
If you look at other,
you know,

2729
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:35,220
socialized medical medical assist,
a great piece on that by Adam Ruins 

2730
02:18:35,220 --> 02:18:36,490
everything.
Have you ever seen that television show?

2731
02:18:36,491 --> 02:18:38,800
It's really interesting.
The breaks down pretty much,

2732
02:18:38,820 --> 02:18:40,930
uh,
a lot of different subjects,

2733
02:18:40,931 --> 02:18:45,931
but big breaks down the American 
healthcare system to pretty much where 

2734
02:18:45,931 --> 02:18:48,370
it went wrong.
And I just encourage anybody to go watch

2735
02:18:48,371 --> 02:18:53,371
it because it just shows how the 
elevated the price of all sorts of 

2736
02:18:53,371 --> 02:18:55,270
different things to try to make up for a
lack of profits.

2737
02:18:55,271 --> 02:18:57,670
And it's really fascinating little 
piece.

2738
02:18:57,860 --> 02:19:02,860
Um,
we are already almost three hours into 

2739
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:03,880
this,
so we haven't talked about Hitler.

2740
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,980
Oh my God.
Well we kind of,

2741
02:19:06,430 --> 02:19:09,280
we kind of did kind of have.
But let me just,

2742
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:14,550
uh,
do you want to lay out your argument 

2743
02:19:14,550 --> 02:19:14,550
about Hitler and that I'll respond to it
and uh,

2744
02:19:14,550 --> 02:19:16,120
um,
I don't know if I do want to.

2745
02:19:16,180 --> 02:19:18,290
I mean,
I think I,

2746
02:19:18,390 --> 02:19:22,630
I actually think that I should stop 
because I'm kind of at the limits of I'm

2747
02:19:22,631 --> 02:19:27,631
at the point where the probability that 
I will say something stupid is starting 

2748
02:19:27,631 --> 02:19:28,070
to increase and I would

2749
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:33,070
rather not because just saying the 
things that I'm trying to say that 

2750
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:35,921
aren't stupid is dangerous enough.
This isn't the topic where you want to 

2751
02:19:35,921 --> 02:19:35,921
make that kind of.
Yes.

2752
02:19:35,921 --> 02:19:38,660
I would say maybe is there a more 
charged subject?

2753
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:42,560
It's funny that it's charged because as 
you point out,

2754
02:19:42,561 --> 02:19:44,570
we're pretty much all in agreement about
it,

2755
02:19:44,571 --> 02:19:45,320
right?
I mean,

2756
02:19:45,610 --> 02:19:49,700
you find someone who's not in there 
instantly ostracized from society.

2757
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:53,330
I mean anybody who has an argument about

2758
02:19:53,510 --> 02:19:58,510
I mean,
there's a really fascinating take on 

2759
02:19:58,510 --> 02:20:01,151
this by Dan Carlin from hardcore history
where he's talking about the amount of 

2760
02:20:01,151 --> 02:20:04,601
time that has passed since a horrible 
atrocity and that there are people that 

2761
02:20:04,601 --> 02:20:07,400
will argue that gang is Khan who killed 
10 percent of the world's population,

2762
02:20:07,401 --> 02:20:12,401
changed things so badly that it 
literally lower the carbon footprint of 

2763
02:20:12,401 --> 02:20:16,940
the human race while he was alive,
killed some untold number of millions of

2764
02:20:16,941 --> 02:20:19,220
people and was responsible for their 
deaths.

2765
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:23,900
People look to him and they find all 
sorts of positive things to attribute to

2766
02:20:23,901 --> 02:20:26,870
his reign,
opening up trade with China,

2767
02:20:26,871 --> 02:20:29,480
opening up trade routes,
although all these different things that

2768
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:34,750
people have attributed to him and that 
some day someone may do the same thing 

2769
02:20:35,751 --> 02:20:38,600
about Adolf Hitler right now.
Well,

2770
02:20:38,601 --> 02:20:39,950
it's impossible.
He,

2771
02:20:39,951 --> 02:20:44,951
uh,
he certainly made that job very 

2772
02:20:44,951 --> 02:20:46,490
difficult with all of the documentation,
especially the films.

2773
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:47,170
But,
um,

2774
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:51,260
but let's just say the argument that I 
want to love,

2775
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:56,320
I want to be really careful to do this 
so that it can't be misinterpreted by 

2776
02:20:56,320 --> 02:20:57,380
anybody.
I'm going to enjoy watching this.

2777
02:20:57,660 --> 02:21:00,410
Okay?
If I'm cornered,

2778
02:21:00,411 --> 02:21:04,660
will,
you know a man going out?

2779
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:08,260
Okay.
So my argument for all

2780
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:13,260
those years ago in my paper that I was 
dead for Bob triggers that I mentioned 

2781
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:17,971
at the beginning was that Hitler was a 
monster as we all know,

2782
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:24,240
but he was a rational monster.
That the program that he deployed was 

2783
02:21:25,210 --> 02:21:29,140
not what he said.
What he said was wrong in many places,

2784
02:21:29,141 --> 02:21:33,070
especially where it gets near Darwinism.
It's just all tangled and broken.

2785
02:21:33,850 --> 02:21:38,850
But what he did was a rational from the 
point of view of increasing the amount 

2786
02:21:42,791 --> 02:21:47,791
of resource that was dedicated to 
producing members of his population.

2787
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:55,060
And so my point is this is the danger 
that we are in.

2788
02:21:55,300 --> 02:22:00,300
If we allow ourselves to imagine that 
genocidal impulses are more or less gone

2789
02:22:05,021 --> 02:22:10,021
from the world because we've all assumed
where we've all agreed that they're a 

2790
02:22:10,021 --> 02:22:10,930
bad thing.
And the point is that they exist in a,

2791
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:16,020
in a latent program,
and at a point when you have austerity 

2792
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:19,610
as a result of a,
usually a,

2793
02:22:19,950 --> 02:22:24,950
uh,
an opportunity that has run its course 

2794
02:22:24,950 --> 02:22:25,740
and has resulted in the population 
growing to fill that opportunity.

2795
02:22:25,741 --> 02:22:26,220
And suddenly

2796
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:29,040
there's nowhere to go because the 
opportunity is all been absorbed.

2797
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:32,670
The tendency of people is to figure out 
who,

2798
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,000
what other population is weak,
and if that population is across a 

2799
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,691
border,
then there's some excuse for war and if 

2800
02:22:41,691 --> 02:22:42,240
the population is within the border,
then it's a genocide.

2801
02:22:42,241 --> 02:22:47,241
But the point is that is an ever present
danger for us to clear it.

2802
02:22:47,390 --> 02:22:52,390
Clarify one thing,
because this argument was sort of 

2803
02:22:52,390 --> 02:22:54,921
phrased as we have a disagreement about 
Hitler and I would like to point out 

2804
02:22:54,921 --> 02:22:58,560
that I don't actually disagree with 
anything that you just said because if I

2805
02:22:58,561 --> 02:23:01,470
remain relatively silent,
I don't want to be seen.

2806
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:06,740
I don't want it to be seen that the fact
that I'm disagreeing with you means or 

2807
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:09,210
that there is a disagreement means that 
it's a disagreement about any of that.

2808
02:23:09,211 --> 02:23:11,910
I think the disagreement was something 
like I said,

2809
02:23:11,911 --> 02:23:14,130
that Hitler was even more evil than we 
thought he was.

2810
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:17,520
And I think,
correct me if I'm wrong,

2811
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:22,760
you're pointing out the danger of 
assuming that you can put Hitler in a.

2812
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:25,890
He was just a monster box and don't 
think about it anymore.

2813
02:23:25,891 --> 02:23:28,170
And I would say I agree absolutely with 
that.

2814
02:23:28,171 --> 02:23:33,171
I mean,
I've studied Hitler a lot and there's a 

2815
02:23:33,171 --> 02:23:33,570
bunch of things that you can't say about
him.

2816
02:23:33,960 --> 02:23:38,960
You can't say he was stupid.
You can't say he was without artistic 

2817
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:43,281
talent.
You can't say that he was a poor 

2818
02:23:43,281 --> 02:23:46,071
organizer.
You can't say that he wasn't 

2819
02:23:46,071 --> 02:23:48,321
charismatic.
You can't say that he did wonders for 

2820
02:23:48,321 --> 02:23:50,770
equal Germany's economy and the first 
part of his reign and,

2821
02:23:51,050 --> 02:23:54,850
and,
and so it's very necessary when you're,

2822
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:58,860
if you're dealing intelligently with a 
true monster that you give the devil his

2823
02:23:58,861 --> 02:24:00,660
due.
Yeah.

2824
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:05,860
Uh,
so I think the thing that I saw in your 

2825
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:07,350
video was your argument was that as he 
was losing,

2826
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:12,560
instead of putting the genocide on pause
and winning and winning,

2827
02:24:14,761 --> 02:24:18,230
the warning that he,
he ratcheted it up the Janet.

2828
02:24:18,510 --> 02:24:23,510
I don't know if it would really be.
I don't think it's necessarily fair to 

2829
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:24,510
say that it was him that did that,
although I think he had a hand in it.

2830
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:27,150
It does appear to me that that's what 
happened.

2831
02:24:27,330 --> 02:24:28,130
Right.
And My,

2832
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:30,480
my point would simply be,
and again,

2833
02:24:30,481 --> 02:24:35,481
there I couldn't possibly be less 
sympathetic with the individual.

2834
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:39,540
My point is simply that from an 
evolutionary point of view,

2835
02:24:39,570 --> 02:24:44,570
if your objective is coldly to increase 
the number of genomes that are spelled 

2836
02:24:44,570 --> 02:24:47,670
the same way that yours are on earth,
that a,

2837
02:24:48,210 --> 02:24:53,210
he did enslave those Jews who were most 
fit to work in service of the German war

2838
02:24:54,871 --> 02:24:55,830
machine.
Right?

2839
02:24:55,831 --> 02:24:59,550
That's what those camps are.
Not all of the camps were work camps.

2840
02:24:59,551 --> 02:25:02,970
But Auschwitz for example,
was both a work camp and a death camp.

2841
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:07,320
And so there was this a tendency to 
enslave.

2842
02:25:07,830 --> 02:25:11,470
And so let me ask you a question about 
this because you know,

2843
02:25:11,850 --> 02:25:16,850
I think you have to make a pretty 
tenuous biological argument to say that 

2844
02:25:16,850 --> 02:25:19,860
there's evolutionary utility in 
increasing the number of your kinsmen,

2845
02:25:19,950 --> 02:25:21,810
but unless they're very close,
but,

2846
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:24,070
but here's a slight variation of that.
You tell me what

2847
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:29,070
you think about this.
Is it reasonable to presume that a 

2848
02:25:29,070 --> 02:25:33,391
decent survival strategy is to 
homogenize your environment with regards

2849
02:25:34,211 --> 02:25:36,280
to under some conditions to homogenize 
your,

2850
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:39,160
your environment with regards to racial 
or ethnic differences?

2851
02:25:39,370 --> 02:25:42,790
To decrease the probability that you and
yours are going to be killed.

2852
02:25:43,190 --> 02:25:45,290
Oh yeah.
Again,

2853
02:25:45,590 --> 02:25:46,980
no this.
Yes,

2854
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:52,000
you are right.
That the extent that there's another 

2855
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:52,000
population that's distinct,
that that population,

2856
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,651
even if it is small and has little power
now might not be small and have little 

2857
02:25:56,651 --> 02:26:00,000
power later and so undoubtedly that 
program is there too.

2858
02:26:01,310 --> 02:26:05,840
But I would say that the tendency to 
believe that evolution only functions at

2859
02:26:05,841 --> 02:26:09,470
the level of kin when you're talking 
about very close relatives,

2860
02:26:09,471 --> 02:26:14,471
I believe is an error that the result of
the fact that evolutionists early on 

2861
02:26:14,471 --> 02:26:19,420
wished to operationalize fitness and 
it's very hard to operationalize fitness

2862
02:26:20,030 --> 02:26:25,030
across population level differences.
And so they built a definition that is 

2863
02:26:25,731 --> 02:26:29,660
about immediate kin,
but there's no logical reason to imagine

2864
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:33,630
that that peters out at the edge.
So and so.

2865
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:38,760
So you're okay.
So all I'm arguing is that what Hitler 

2866
02:26:38,760 --> 02:26:42,911
did was go after a population inside his
border that was more distantly related 

2867
02:26:44,721 --> 02:26:47,150
to the people who were his constituents.

2868
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:52,360
And then he went obviously after Eastern
Europe and sought the future of Germany 

2869
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:57,640
in Russia and it took $12 million,
a russianist of turnaround,

2870
02:26:58,071 --> 02:27:00,080
the German war machine.
I mean,

2871
02:27:00,081 --> 02:27:02,690
those are military deaths that were 
investing more civilian deaths.

2872
02:27:02,691 --> 02:27:07,691
But um,
but the point is he did not succeed in 

2873
02:27:07,691 --> 02:27:12,401
doing what he set out to do,
but he also didn't fail in the sense 

2874
02:27:12,401 --> 02:27:16,750
that he took a bunch of resources that 
belong to a population that was more 

2875
02:27:16,750 --> 02:27:18,680
distantly related.
And,

2876
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:24,000
um,
he got rid of those people and by 

2877
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,681
getting rid of them,
increased the amount of resource that 

2878
02:27:26,681 --> 02:27:28,280
was available to ariens.
This has nothing to do.

2879
02:27:28,970 --> 02:27:33,650
Jeans are not interested in figuring out
which genes are superior.

2880
02:27:33,651 --> 02:27:36,860
All of the language about German 
superiorities nonsense.

2881
02:27:37,610 --> 02:27:40,520
However,
genes are very interested.

2882
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:42,410
I mean,
they're obviously jeans,

2883
02:27:42,411 --> 02:27:47,411
they don't think,
but they act as if they are interested 

2884
02:27:47,411 --> 02:27:47,411
in replacing alternative spellings.

2885
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:52,620
Part of the reason that you're walking 
through this just so that this track of 

2886
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:56,470
this remains self-evident is to caution 
people against,

2887
02:27:57,060 --> 02:28:02,060
to alert people to the fact that the 
sorts of programs that Hitler both ran 

2888
02:28:02,801 --> 02:28:06,460
and elicited from people are lurking in 
our,

2889
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:07,960
let's say,
in our genome,

2890
02:28:07,961 --> 02:28:10,420
in our,
in our set of biological possibilities,

2891
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:13,990
and we have to be very awake to that 
fact on an ongoing basis.

2892
02:28:13,991 --> 02:28:18,991
They are lurking in our genomes,
which does not mean that we as adults 

2893
02:28:18,991 --> 02:28:21,860
have this as a possibility.
Many people will not go with this.

2894
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:24,740
Other people have it lurking to be 
triggered.

2895
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:27,320
And I think what worries me is that 
trump,

2896
02:28:27,321 --> 02:28:32,321
I think very cynically utilized this 
lurking program in order to gain office 

2897
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:38,980
that he played upon the fact that 
certain people were waiting to hear 

2898
02:28:38,980 --> 02:28:41,030
those noises and what he said about 
Charlottesville,

2899
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:42,920
you know,
again,

2900
02:28:42,921 --> 02:28:44,510
he did not,
uh,

2901
02:28:45,710 --> 02:28:47,330
he did not go after the

2902
02:28:47,530 --> 02:28:52,530
nationalists.
The way that you see the white 

2903
02:28:52,530 --> 02:28:52,530
nationalist response,
do you see,

2904
02:28:52,530 --> 02:28:53,620
knows the dealer storm had?
Is that what it's called?

2905
02:28:54,340 --> 02:28:59,340
I think one of the,
one of the white nationalist papers had 

2906
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:01,950
a breakdown of what trump did and that 
essentially at the end they were saying 

2907
02:29:01,950 --> 02:29:02,650
he didn't go after us.
He didn't target us.

2908
02:29:02,651 --> 02:29:07,651
This is very good.
He was very clear that it was all sides 

2909
02:29:07,651 --> 02:29:08,290
and that he'd never wants.
Targeted us.

2910
02:29:08,291 --> 02:29:11,830
Didn't say anything bad about us.
And they said God blessed trump.

2911
02:29:11,831 --> 02:29:12,380
At the end of it.

2912
02:29:12,430 --> 02:29:14,680
There's a real tricky issue there about 
truth,

2913
02:29:14,710 --> 02:29:17,620
you know,
because I was.

2914
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:22,420
Because my free speech free speech panel
that I was a part of was counseled.

2915
02:29:22,870 --> 02:29:25,930
I had to make comments in the Canadian 
media about Charlottesville.

2916
02:29:26,410 --> 02:29:31,410
And so I really had to think about what 
trump said because the,

2917
02:29:31,510 --> 02:29:36,510
the fact that there is reprehensible 
behavior on both sides of the extremes 

2918
02:29:36,510 --> 02:29:39,460
of the distribution is true.
However,

2919
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:45,360
truth is a tricky thing because you have
to take the temporal context into 

2920
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:45,360
account,
you know,

2921
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:49,570
because I would say you can imagine that
there are white lies and black truths.

2922
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:52,150
Uh,
black truth is when you use the truth in

2923
02:29:52,151 --> 02:29:56,110
a way that isn't truthful,
just like a white lie is when you use a,

2924
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:58,480
when you lie in a way that isn't 
harmful,

2925
02:29:58,660 --> 02:30:03,660
you can use the truth to wound and hurt,
and what that really means is that 

2926
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:05,170
you've misused the truth and so it's 
actually a complex form of lie.

2927
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:06,380
But what,
what,

2928
02:30:06,490 --> 02:30:09,550
what trump did wrong.
This is independent of whether or not he

2929
02:30:09,551 --> 02:30:11,830
was actually engaging in manipulation or
deceit,

2930
02:30:11,831 --> 02:30:16,831
was he failed to specify the time and 
the place for the utterance because what

2931
02:30:17,471 --> 02:30:19,300
he should have come out and done with 
said,

2932
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:24,670
I unequivocally denounce the white 
supremacist racism that emerged in 

2933
02:30:27,221 --> 02:30:30,160
Charlottesville.
And then he should have shut up and then

2934
02:30:30,161 --> 02:30:32,200
two weeks later he could've said,
well,

2935
02:30:32,980 --> 02:30:35,410
would we look at the political landscape
as a whole?

2936
02:30:35,470 --> 02:30:40,470
Perhaps commenting on Berkeley.
He could have said it's pretty obvious 

2937
02:30:40,470 --> 02:30:43,300
that there are reprehensible individuals
acting out at both ends of the extreme.

2938
02:30:43,301 --> 02:30:47,320
But the Charlottesville week wasn't the 
week to make that point.

2939
02:30:48,100 --> 02:30:51,940
So.
And you know why he did that.

2940
02:30:51,970 --> 02:30:56,440
While it could be just ineptness because
it was a very tricky week to exactly get

2941
02:30:56,441 --> 02:30:58,240
things right.
I don't think so.

2942
02:30:58,330 --> 02:31:01,330
I think actually we can look at the,
uh,

2943
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:06,360
what he did during the election and I 
think we should expect that he would do 

2944
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:06,360
exactly what he did.
Well,

2945
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:07,510
fair enough.
That I think there's,

2946
02:31:08,770 --> 02:31:11,350
there's a wink and a nod to them.
Always would it?

2947
02:31:11,370 --> 02:31:14,550
Neo Nazis and once President Donald 
Trump's response with dale.

2948
02:31:14,610 --> 02:31:15,490
Yeah.
See,

2949
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:20,520
see if he could see the actual.
Does it show the actual text of what 

2950
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:20,520
they wrote?
Because

2951
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:22,410
quote from the editor here,
right there,

2952
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:30,040
uh,
increased even mentioned anything to do 

2953
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:32,001
with us.
Reporters were screaming at him in the 

2954
02:31:32,001 --> 02:31:32,001
white nationalism when he just walked 
out of the room.

2955
02:31:32,001 --> 02:31:32,170
Huh?

2956
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:34,040
Right.
Um,

2957
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:39,140
there was,
there was an actual article that they 

2958
02:31:39,140 --> 02:31:40,140
wrote on one of those websites.
Trump's comments were good.

2959
02:31:40,141 --> 02:31:41,040
He didn't attack.
That's it.

2960
02:31:41,220 --> 02:31:46,220
You didn't attack us.
Just that the nation should come 

2961
02:31:46,220 --> 02:31:46,220
together.
Nothing specific against us.

2962
02:31:46,220 --> 02:31:50,360
He said that we need to study why people
get so angry and implied there was 

2963
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:50,730
hate.dot
on both sides.

2964
02:31:50,731 --> 02:31:55,731
Exclamation point.
So he implied that the Antifa are 

2965
02:31:55,731 --> 02:31:55,731
haters,
I mean,

2966
02:31:55,731 --> 02:31:58,020
so that,
that energize them in a way,

2967
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:01,290
and I mean there's no secret that they 
support him,

2968
02:32:01,291 --> 02:32:02,010
you know.
Um,

2969
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:04,040
my friend Alonzo Boden is a very funny 
quote.

2970
02:32:04,041 --> 02:32:05,070
He's a comedian.
He goes,

2971
02:32:05,310 --> 02:32:08,730
not all trump supporters are racist,
but all racists are trump supporters.

2972
02:32:08,930 --> 02:32:11,010
Right?
It's a great quote.

2973
02:32:11,190 --> 02:32:12,660
And he,
that's,

2974
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:17,870
there's political power in that,
whether or not trump is a racist or 

2975
02:32:17,870 --> 02:32:19,230
whether it's the wink and the nod to 
that side,

2976
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:22,140
that is the only wink and a nod that 
they're getting.

2977
02:32:23,030 --> 02:32:23,660
Yeah.
Or even,

2978
02:32:23,870 --> 02:32:27,770
or even insufficient denunciation,
which was kind of what did in,

2979
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:29,570
there's a Canadian journalist named 
faith,

2980
02:32:29,571 --> 02:32:32,850
Goldie who got fired from rebel media 
for being,

2981
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:34,750
being a,
uh,

2982
02:32:35,270 --> 02:32:38,580
being accused of being too cozy with the
daily stormer type.

2983
02:32:38,581 --> 02:32:40,820
She did a podcast with,
with crypto.

2984
02:32:41,150 --> 02:32:43,010
And I listened to the podcast.
We're carefully.

2985
02:32:43,011 --> 02:32:48,011
She was actually one of the people that 
were supposed to be a panelist on this 

2986
02:32:48,011 --> 02:32:48,440
free speech talk.
And so that put us in a real bind.

2987
02:32:48,890 --> 02:32:51,290
But well,
what happened in the podcast?

2988
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:53,030
Well,
what happened was,

2989
02:32:53,180 --> 02:32:58,180
in my estimation was that she didn't 
properly fulfill her role as critical 

2990
02:32:59,961 --> 02:33:01,550
journalist.
She was.

2991
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:04,310
It was sort of like a discussion with 
your friendly neighborhood,

2992
02:33:04,311 --> 02:33:09,311
Neo Nazi,
and what I mean by that is she didn't 

2993
02:33:09,311 --> 02:33:09,630
ally herself,
La Ellie,

2994
02:33:09,631 --> 02:33:14,631
hers,
ally herself with any of the purported 

2995
02:33:14,631 --> 02:33:15,920
aims of the Neo Nazi people she was 
talking to,

2996
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:20,600
but I think she failed to criticize them
sufficiently.

2997
02:33:20,660 --> 02:33:23,720
She didn't ask the tough questions,
you know now,

2998
02:33:24,560 --> 02:33:29,560
and that end that that was a.
That was while it was a fatal error.

2999
02:33:29,601 --> 02:33:34,601
I mean she got fired from rebel media 
and it's going to have terrible 

3000
02:33:34,601 --> 02:33:38,231
repercussions for her,
although she may land on her feet on 

3001
02:33:38,231 --> 02:33:38,231
rebel media is very conservative as 
well.

3002
02:33:38,390 --> 02:33:40,310
Certainly by Canadian standards.
Yeah,

3003
02:33:40,340 --> 02:33:41,210
yeah,
that's right.

3004
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:46,220
No,
rebel media like imploded in the 

3005
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:48,230
aftermath of Charlottesville because of 
what faith goal he did with,

3006
02:33:48,410 --> 02:33:49,670
with a,
a daily.

3007
02:33:50,180 --> 02:33:53,330
It wasn't even the daily stormer was a 
group called Crypto,

3008
02:33:53,331 --> 02:33:58,331
but there,
there are associated with the daily 

3009
02:33:58,331 --> 02:33:58,331
stormer,
so she went on there,

3010
02:33:58,331 --> 02:34:02,381
which I think you could make.
You could make a case that that's okay 

3011
02:34:02,381 --> 02:34:03,710
as a journalist you can go talk to Neil 
Nazis,

3012
02:34:03,711 --> 02:34:08,711
but the question is how do you talk to 
them and write the answer to that is you

3013
02:34:09,351 --> 02:34:14,351
point out their agenda.
You don't allow them to masquerade as 

3014
02:34:14,351 --> 02:34:15,980
friendly,
as friendly,

3015
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:18,130
innocent people.
You can't do that.

3016
02:34:18,131 --> 02:34:22,010
And so I would say she,
she damned herself by

3017
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:25,240
efficiently criticizing the villains.
It was something like that.

3018
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:30,300
You familiar?
I'm sure you are familiar with Louis 

3019
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:30,300
Theroux?
No,

3020
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:32,590
I'm not really through the documentary 
and genome from England.

3021
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:34,510
Fascinating guy.
Fantastic.

3022
02:34:34,530 --> 02:34:38,530
Like one of the best and one of the 
things that he's done is um,

3023
02:34:38,630 --> 02:34:43,630
well he's,
he's interviewed a ton of different 

3024
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:45,721
people,
but one of the great ones that he did 

3025
02:34:45,721 --> 02:34:47,551
was the Westboro Baptist church.
And he sort of embedded himself with 

3026
02:34:47,551 --> 02:34:51,331
them and was a very congenial and very 
kind and unthreatening and stayed with 

3027
02:34:54,131 --> 02:34:59,131
them for long periods of time,
like weeks on end and got them to 

3028
02:34:59,131 --> 02:35:04,051
eventually like expose who they were and
and understand from like the point of 

3029
02:35:07,121 --> 02:35:11,500
view of an insider and in a sense 
without necessarily condemning them,

3030
02:35:11,501 --> 02:35:13,570
but with just constantly asking 
questions,

3031
02:35:13,571 --> 02:35:15,730
but being very,
very polite about it.

3032
02:35:16,120 --> 02:35:17,880
Not like a bunch,
not,

3033
02:35:17,881 --> 02:35:22,150
not like a lot of serious,
like a confrontational criticism rather.

3034
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:27,360
But a very friendly sort of polite 
British way of discussing things.

3035
02:35:27,931 --> 02:35:31,180
And he's particularly good at embedding 
himself.

3036
02:35:31,300 --> 02:35:36,300
He did it with scientology.
He's done it with a bunch of different 

3037
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:36,300
groups.
He embeds himself

3038
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:36,930
just sorta.
So there's.

3039
02:35:37,140 --> 02:35:40,020
So there's a justification for 
attempting that sort of thing.

3040
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:41,470
Clearly this.
But,

3041
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:45,390
and I really had to think this through 
because well what happened with our talk

3042
02:35:45,391 --> 02:35:50,391
was it was so hall of mirrors,
like it was like it was a talk about 

3043
02:35:50,391 --> 02:35:52,230
free speech talks being shut down on 
campus.

3044
02:35:52,231 --> 02:35:57,231
That was shut down by a campus and it 
was a panel of people who purport to 

3045
02:35:58,891 --> 02:36:03,891
support free speech,
who knocked someone off the panel 

3046
02:36:03,891 --> 02:36:03,891
because of something.
Well,

3047
02:36:03,891 --> 02:36:08,480
not precisely that she said,
but it's close enough to make the irony 

3048
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:11,691
rather palpable is so I had to go 
through what happened with faith very 

3049
02:36:11,731 --> 02:36:15,090
carefully to figure out what the right 
ethical pathway was,

3050
02:36:15,091 --> 02:36:20,091
you know,
but I listened to the podcast very 

3051
02:36:20,091 --> 02:36:22,581
carefully.
I listened to it with my son and we 

3052
02:36:22,581 --> 02:36:24,321
talked about it a lot and our conclusion
was that she had failed to.

3053
02:36:25,080 --> 02:36:29,790
She had failed to.
She didn't ask enough tough questions.

3054
02:36:29,850 --> 02:36:31,110
One would have done it,
even.

3055
02:36:31,111 --> 02:36:36,111
Maybe two would have done it for sure,
but it was the discussion was to corteal

3056
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:41,720
mm.
And it could've even been cordial to 

3057
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:42,000
your point because maybe that would have
led to more discussions,

3058
02:36:42,270 --> 02:36:44,770
but it should have been cordial with one
snake bite.

3059
02:36:45,330 --> 02:36:50,330
No,
that was required to make that snake 

3060
02:36:50,330 --> 02:36:50,330
bite.
I mean,

3061
02:36:50,330 --> 02:36:50,460
well,
it depends on what you mean by required.

3062
02:36:50,620 --> 02:36:55,620
Well,
my thought is to find out what these 

3063
02:36:55,620 --> 02:36:56,800
people really want and really like.
We're really trying to achieve.

3064
02:36:57,130 --> 02:36:59,440
Sometimes you don't have to be 
confrontational with them.

3065
02:36:59,441 --> 02:37:01,870
You just got to allow them to be 
comfortable and come out.

3066
02:37:01,871 --> 02:37:05,200
Bell did that really great on a CNN show
with the KKK.

3067
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:09,400
He sort of just allowed them to be 
themselves and they became more and more

3068
02:37:09,401 --> 02:37:14,401
comfortable with him.
The more time they spend with them to 

3069
02:37:14,401 --> 02:37:14,401
the point where they're actually joking 
around with him,

3070
02:37:14,401 --> 02:37:18,510
but you got to see the ugliness was so 
obvious and evident and without him 

3071
02:37:19,011 --> 02:37:21,830
confronting them on without him yelling 
and arguing,

3072
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:27,010
you got to see it from him.
Just being friendly and joking around 

3073
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:28,280
with them.
Now nobody would ever accuse a black man

3074
02:37:28,281 --> 02:37:32,510
like come out bell with being a 
sympathizer with the KKK.

3075
02:37:32,690 --> 02:37:35,630
He was in this inarguable position like 
no one,

3076
02:37:35,660 --> 02:37:37,310
no one could get accused him of it.

3077
02:37:37,610 --> 02:37:41,420
This woman I'm assuming is white.
That's where the problem lies.

3078
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:46,560
One of the problems,
but she was a black woman in the very 

3079
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:47,270
same situation like oprah was in the 
past.

3080
02:37:47,271 --> 02:37:52,271
Like Oprah interviewed the KKK in the 
past and she was never accused of being 

3081
02:37:52,910 --> 02:37:56,090
like somehow or another,
a sympathetic person to them.

3082
02:37:56,300 --> 02:38:01,300
Right.
And somehow we have to raise the 

3083
02:38:01,300 --> 02:38:01,970
threshold of a fence.
There's,

3084
02:38:02,120 --> 02:38:04,820
there are lots of ways to contribute to 
the conversation.

3085
02:38:04,850 --> 02:38:09,850
One of them may be to embed yourself and
actually allow the world to see people 

3086
02:38:10,521 --> 02:38:12,470
who are doing something abhorrent in 
the,

3087
02:38:12,620 --> 02:38:15,530
in the way that they see themselves so 
you can understand it.

3088
02:38:15,580 --> 02:38:19,270
Just being there asking questions.
You don't necessarily have to be like,

3089
02:38:19,460 --> 02:38:21,930
what are you going to change them?
And being critical to them.

3090
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Just getting in arguments with them.
I mean they might be able to see 

3091
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:30,011
something from that from their response 
to like rational discussion about their 

3092
02:38:30,011 --> 02:38:30,011
issues.

3093
02:38:30,011 --> 02:38:34,940
This brings us down a whole other rabbit
hole which maybe we could talk about at 

3094
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:36,390
some point in the future because this is
a really interesting topic.

3095
02:38:36,391 --> 02:38:41,391
You know,
like part of the reason that I've been 

3096
02:38:41,391 --> 02:38:43,281
accused of being on the far right say or
on the right is because I've talked to 

3097
02:38:43,591 --> 02:38:46,290
people talk with people who perhaps 
have,

3098
02:38:46,950 --> 02:38:51,950
are closer.
What would you say have an association 

3099
02:38:51,950 --> 02:38:55,221
network that might be more closely 
aligned with that than people are 

3100
02:38:55,221 --> 02:38:55,710
comfortable with,
but my attitude is being too.

3101
02:38:55,730 --> 02:39:00,730
It's,
and I don't want to talk about this in 

3102
02:39:00,730 --> 02:39:00,730
much detail because it's really 
complicated,

3103
02:39:00,730 --> 02:39:04,410
but the the,
the anti left spectrum,

3104
02:39:04,411 --> 02:39:09,411
let's say is very confused and it could 
easily tilt very rapidly into the hard 

3105
02:39:10,861 --> 02:39:13,020
right Auntie left,
which is the danger that,

3106
02:39:13,110 --> 02:39:18,110
that you were describing and partly what
I'm hoping is that I can talk to people 

3107
02:39:18,110 --> 02:39:22,461
who might conceivably beyond that 
developmental pathway because they're 

3108
02:39:22,461 --> 02:39:24,270
tired of being accused of implicit 
racism,

3109
02:39:24,271 --> 02:39:25,590
let's say and say,
look,

3110
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:31,520
you can be anti radical left without 
falling all the way into the to the far 

3111
02:39:32,371 --> 02:39:37,371
right and here's how you might do it,
but that means I have to talk to them 

3112
02:39:37,371 --> 02:39:38,220
and then if I talk to them,
that means I risk association with them.

3113
02:39:38,220 --> 02:39:42,540
In that risks being tainted.
It's a very tricky line to walk,

3114
02:39:42,990 --> 02:39:44,590
but it's also one of the.
One of the

3115
02:39:44,590 --> 02:39:47,650
big problems with this hard stance of 
the,

3116
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:51,280
of the left of the hard left.
Like this pepe,

3117
02:39:51,281 --> 02:39:52,990
the frog thing like that,
anybody.

3118
02:39:52,991 --> 02:39:57,991
I mean,
one of the things that I tweeted with 

3119
02:39:57,991 --> 02:39:58,240
some guy that called me and you just 
admitted you're a Nazi because you.

3120
02:39:58,550 --> 02:40:03,550
I posted a meme that someone had created
of me as pepe the frog and apparently 

3121
02:40:03,550 --> 02:40:06,340
there's pepe the frog of everybody and 
so I put this guy was like,

3122
02:40:06,370 --> 02:40:07,810
well,
you just admitted you're a Nazi.

3123
02:40:07,811 --> 02:40:08,470
And I'm like,
see,

3124
02:40:08,710 --> 02:40:12,820
this is a part of the problem and this 
creates a massive blow back.

3125
02:40:12,990 --> 02:40:17,990
People are getting angry because that 
frog for the most part is used 

3126
02:40:17,990 --> 02:40:17,990
humorously and yeah,

3127
02:40:17,990 --> 02:40:22,830
actually you used the phrase defensive 
humor and it really is,

3128
02:40:22,861 --> 02:40:24,370
and I think,
I mean this is.

3129
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:26,900
I didn't mean to interrupt your job,
but don't please do.

3130
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:31,920
There's something about the idea that 
the effectiveness of this meme is that 

3131
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:37,500
it tangles people with no sense of humor
in knots and that's a huge part of why 

3132
02:40:38,351 --> 02:40:41,280
those things are generated.
That's exactly right.

3133
02:40:42,140 --> 02:40:43,100
Yeah,
yeah,

3134
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:44,300
yeah.
I mean,

3135
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:49,320
I'm,
I'm fearing that I'm saying something 

3136
02:40:49,320 --> 02:40:51,841
about this frog and that there's going 
to be something that's going to emerge 

3137
02:40:51,841 --> 02:40:52,390
that I should know about that somehow 
I'm admitting something,

3138
02:40:52,391 --> 02:40:56,620
but all I'm saying is what I see is a 
lot of people using it to taunt people.

3139
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:58,660
Yes.
Can't figure out.

3140
02:40:58,810 --> 02:41:01,630
I think that's the vast majority of it.
I do believe that.

3141
02:41:01,631 --> 02:41:03,660
And I think the same thing about the 
kick of standard

3142
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:06,790
is that that's almost all humor.
Yeah.

3143
02:41:06,791 --> 02:41:11,791
And there's some massive problem with 
pushing back against that and calling 

3144
02:41:11,791 --> 02:41:14,140
those people Nazis and racists and 
especially when they're just using humor

3145
02:41:14,141 --> 02:41:19,141
and especially when it's very clear,
if you look at all the memes online and 

3146
02:41:19,141 --> 02:41:20,410
I went thoroughly through Google to find
them.

3147
02:41:20,550 --> 02:41:21,310
There is some,
uh,

3148
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:23,260
born once.
There are some horrible ones.

3149
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:26,410
There are some ones that are with the 
Nazi uniforms.

3150
02:41:26,580 --> 02:41:28,900
There's some,
there's some anti jus ones.

3151
02:41:28,901 --> 02:41:32,070
There's some horrific ones.
Most of them are not that.

3152
02:41:32,140 --> 02:41:35,050
Most of them,
the vast majority of them are humorous.

3153
02:41:35,290 --> 02:41:37,030
And if the.
And again,

3154
02:41:37,031 --> 02:41:42,031
these people are not coordinating,
so if one person decides to make a 

3155
02:41:42,031 --> 02:41:46,170
Mickey Mouse Racist Meme,
which by the way a lot of the earliest 

3156
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:49,421
mickey mouse cartoons,
you could just take a screenshot and 

3157
02:41:49,421 --> 02:41:53,101
they're fucking tremendously racist 
because dealing with the side of the 

3158
02:41:53,101 --> 02:41:56,911
times,
I mean images of black people that were 

3159
02:41:56,911 --> 02:41:56,911
extremely cartoonish,
you know,

3160
02:41:56,911 --> 02:41:59,590
giant lips,
black faces the whole deal.

3161
02:42:00,010 --> 02:42:05,010
Horribly racist.
You could say Mickey Mouse is fucking 

3162
02:42:05,010 --> 02:42:05,010
racist,
don't go to Disneyland.

3163
02:42:05,010 --> 02:42:05,770
No one saying that.
Right?

3164
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:07,990
But they could.
And this is a slippery slope.

3165
02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:09,760
You start with the frog,
you know,

3166
02:42:10,450 --> 02:42:15,450
and you know,
first they came for pepe and I didn't 

3167
02:42:15,450 --> 02:42:15,450
say anything.
Yeah,

3168
02:42:15,450 --> 02:42:18,310
well if the frog is racist,
you start wondering what isn't racist 

3169
02:42:18,310 --> 02:42:21,820
because it's bloody cartoon frog.
But you can make a cartoon about 

3170
02:42:21,820 --> 02:42:24,070
everything that has ever existed and 
make that racist.

3171
02:42:24,460 --> 02:42:27,820
It doesn't mean that the frog is racist.
This is where it's crazy.

3172
02:42:27,821 --> 02:42:31,030
It's like what percentage of people are 
making the frog races?

3173
02:42:31,180 --> 02:42:36,180
And then for the southern poverty law 
center to say that this is a symbol of 

3174
02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:36,180
hate.
Now this frog.

3175
02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:37,120
Well,
well guess what,

3176
02:42:37,150 --> 02:42:42,150
you just back these fucking people up 
against the wall and you shared their 

3177
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:42,250
offense is because now they're 
realizing,

3178
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:46,090
oh well these people are mad.
They're not just mad like angry,

3179
02:42:46,091 --> 02:42:51,091
but mad like insane.
Like you're not looking at this thing 

3180
02:42:51,091 --> 02:42:54,601
rationally at all.
You're saying that a frog where 99 

3181
02:42:54,601 --> 02:42:55,570
percent of the memes or just humorous or
silly.

3182
02:42:55,900 --> 02:42:57,970
Now the frog is a hate symbol.

3183
02:42:58,440 --> 02:43:02,340
Not only a hate symbol,
but Nazi white supremacist.

3184
02:43:02,341 --> 02:43:07,341
I mean the.
You're just drawing up all of the space 

3185
02:43:07,440 --> 02:43:12,440
between their preposterous perspective 
and the nightmare at the other end of 

3186
02:43:12,440 --> 02:43:12,440
the spectrum.

3187
02:43:12,440 --> 02:43:16,060
And the point is almost all of us live 
in that intermediate space.

3188
02:43:16,550 --> 02:43:20,050
It's almost all thoughts live in that 
intermediate space.

3189
02:43:20,410 --> 02:43:23,640
There's a variability of all thoughts,
you know,

3190
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:28,660
and there's,
there's flexibility of all ideas and 

3191
02:43:28,660 --> 02:43:30,670
when you're talking about something that
we're extremely humorous,

3192
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:35,700
you're talking about a humorous frog.
I mean God damn to crawl that all hate 

3193
02:43:35,800 --> 02:43:40,800
when sometimes it's hate and by who,
by whatever the fucking people are that 

3194
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:44,350
did that hateful thing.
Those are the people that are hateful,

3195
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:47,320
not the other ones that are using that 
frog for humor.

3196
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:49,700
I mean,
this is the fact that this is a.

3197
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:54,840
An argument at all.
Just shows how lost we are in these 

3198
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:56,230
ideological arguments is left versus 
right.

3199
02:43:56,231 --> 02:44:01,231
Extreme end of the spectrum on one end 
of the field throwing rocks at the far 

3200
02:44:01,421 --> 02:44:04,450
end of the field.
Most of us are in the middle somewhere.

3201
02:44:04,510 --> 02:44:06,160
It's hopeless.
If we,

3202
02:44:06,161 --> 02:44:10,120
if we cannot have discussions about a 
frog cartoon,

3203
02:44:10,860 --> 02:44:13,870
cartoon frog.
I mean Jesus Christ.

3204
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:15,070
Well,
that's so weird.

3205
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:16,990
It's a nice conclusion.
Yeah,

3206
02:44:16,991 --> 02:44:18,670
it might be.
It might be.

3207
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,050
Listen,
this was a lot of fun.

3208
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:25,240
It was always this and I'm glad you guys
came up with this idea and I'm glad we 

3209
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:28,600
had the time to do it.
It was fantastic to meet you.

3210
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:32,290
I'm Jordan Peterson.
What is your twitter handle again?

3211
02:44:32,610 --> 02:44:37,610
Jordan Peterson and Bret Weinstein.
Weinstein on twitter.

3212
02:44:38,050 --> 02:44:40,180
Weinstein saying Weinstein.
It doesn't make.

3213
02:44:40,181 --> 02:44:41,980
You're not changeable.
Sorry.

3214
02:44:42,010 --> 02:44:43,340
SORTA,
sorta.

3215
02:44:43,510 --> 02:44:45,520
Alright,
but thank you guys.

3216
02:44:45,521 --> 02:44:46,630
Really appreciate it.
A lot of fun.

3217
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:47,710
Yep.
Good to see you again.

3218
02:44:47,830 --> 02:44:48,490
Bye.
Everybody.
