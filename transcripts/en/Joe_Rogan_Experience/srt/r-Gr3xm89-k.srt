1
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,850
Boom,
and we're live.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,260
Dude.
You survive.

3
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:13,140
What's up buddy?
Jorge.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,060
He survived the Joey Diaz experience.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,780
You know,
I got,

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,810
I got a um,
I got uh,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,460
uh,
uh,

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,900
attacks from Tom.
Tom.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,810
Tom,
right?

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,640
Yeah.
I said because he asked me,

11
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:27,940
we were backstage about to go onstage at
the main room and he's like,

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,220
I want you to do my podcast,
blah blah blah.

13
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:31,180
And I'm like,
awesome.

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,010
And then we were texting just about my 
schedule with him and then he's.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,970
And then I'm like,
okay,

16
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm going to go see Joey Diaz de da.
And he's like,

17
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:40,960
dude,
fucking gummy bears.

18
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:42,520
Watch out.
And I'm like,

19
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:43,810
what are you talking about?
I didn't like,

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,550
I didn't understand what he was talking 
about.

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,200
Like I didn't,
you know what I mean?

22
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:48,850
I didn't,
I honestly didn't like,

23
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:49,570
I was like,
whatever,

24
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:52,030
I don't what you're talking about.
And then once I got there,

25
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,040
you know,
I smoke weed sometimes,

26
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,590
you know,
I don't smoke all the time but I like to

27
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:57,940
smoke weed sometimes,
but the,

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,200
but as far as the edibles,
I like Dean Gelber is like given me some

29
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,390
pot stuff.
But like cookies and shit,

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,170
but then like he was eating these gummy 
bears and they're in,

31
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,730
in a bag and I was like,
going,

32
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:10,630
fuck,
okay.

33
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:12,000
And he gave me just like,
uh,

34
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,780
he gave me just like an ear or some shit
and that was it.

35
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:21,781
And then I was just like talking to him 
and then like literally I couldn't talk 

36
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,441
anymore.
I couldn't talk part of it right at a 

37
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:26,920
half a one I had to leave.

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,390
He's got some that are like 500 
milligrams,

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,860
which is just insane.
So you probably had half of that,

40
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,590
which is like 250,
which is fucking insane.

41
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,720
That's an insane amount of weed.
But

42
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,050
Gee,
I had.

43
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,100
But I had done mushrooms once before 
when I was younger and it felt like 

44
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,100
that.

45
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,450
Yeah,
well that's the risk of repeating myself

46
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:51,980
over and over again,
which I do all the time.

47
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:56,981
But when you eat marijuana,
it's processed by your liver and it 

48
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:59,420
produces something called 11 hydroxy 
metabolite.

49
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,940
It's a totally different psychoactive 
substance sets,

50
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,090
four to five times more psychoactive 
than thc.

51
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,420
So that's why it hits you like that.
And that's why people think they got 

52
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,060
dosed because when you smoke pot that 
the,

53
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,440
it's not psychoactive,
but when you eat it,

54
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:18,260
it's processed by your liver.
It's something called a one pass.

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,180
And that's how it produces that.

56
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Yeah.
And I can't believe he let me drive 

57
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:25,220
home.
Like,

58
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:25,290
seriously.
I mean I could like.

59
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,120
Because when I was driving home I was 
like,

60
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:28,020
dude,
I got to go.

61
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:30,300
Like I stopped that guy,
can't answer your questions.

62
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,130
And then I said let's,
I have to go.

63
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,280
And I left and I drove out and he like,
he let me drive.

64
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:35,610
Like

65
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,010
you got to understand Joey Diaz found 
his mother dead on the kitchen floor 

66
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,341
when he was on acid when he was 13.
He would let you fly a fucking plane on 

67
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,220
those things.
He doesn't give a shit.

68
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,900
He's just like,
you'll figure it out.

69
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:51,000
Cock sucker.
Anyways.

70
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,590
So when did it hit you?
Like he did a podcast,

71
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,320
like how,
how different do I have?

72
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:58,900
Fifteen minutes into it and I couldn't 
speak.

73
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,700
I had to stop.

74
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,970
I couldn't speak.
Just released the podcast.

75
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,740
I don't know.
I think he did the audio but not the 

76
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:09,740
video.
Oh,

77
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:09,740
I told them not to do it.

78
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,710
Video.
I couldn't answer any questions,

79
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,330
but wouldn't that be funny?
Yeah,

80
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,310
I guess.
I don't know.

81
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,160
I would like to see myself that fucked 
up where I can't even talk.

82
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,040
Those,
uh,

83
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,320
those edibles are fucking terrifying.
Terrifying.

84
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:26,140
I'm like,
they were like,

85
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,210
you know,
skittles or some shit.

86
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,880
He's a different type of human.
Well,

87
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,890
there's a lot of those people now 
because edibles and marijuana has been 

88
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,671
legal for so long.
There's so many medical patients in 

89
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:41,401
California that you get these people 
that have insane tolerances and they're 

90
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:44,750
just doing dabs and eaten cookies and 
just like Jesus,

91
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,580
just like they go down

92
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,380
unit the whole marijuana movement and 
that whole thing is so much different.

93
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:52,940
Different when,
when I was growing up,

94
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,840
you know,
when I grew up,

95
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,470
we still like smoke it too.
We'd go to the beach and we put a towel 

96
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,950
over us.
We'd hide it now.

97
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:02,550
Like,
like last night I was at the,

98
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:04,870
uh,
the funny or die party and it was a,

99
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,520
it was the 10th anniversary and I was 
just walking around,

100
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:10,730
just smells like weed everywhere.
It's just very normal now.

101
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:11,390
Like,
you know,

102
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:11,660
that,

103
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,020
I don't know,
that's just the way I think it's good 

104
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,240
because it's just like drinking is 
normally by the bar,

105
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:23,270
the comedy store,
you see a bunch of people having a 

106
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,270
couple of drinks is wrong with that.
It's all good,

107
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,720
but thanks for having me.
My pleasure.

108
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,620
Yeah.
I'll tell you this,

109
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:28,360
this,
uh,

110
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,410
impression.
You're dealing with this White House 

111
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:33,410
character.
What's his name again?

112
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:33,410
Uh,
Steven Miller.

113
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:33,410
Yeah.
That's,

114
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,710
first of all,
everyone's doing Sean Spicer.

115
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,870
They weren't until he got fired or they 
did go is,

116
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:43,520
it's a scaramucci and Sean's.
Yeah.

117
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,960
Melissa Mccarthy Doing Sean Spicer 
killed it.

118
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:47,010
Yeah.
It's hilarious.

119
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,300
It's funny.
Trump thought that it made him look weak

120
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,320
that a woman was doing an impression of 
would,

121
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,260
should go and do an impression and trump
now because of that.

122
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:58,740
Yeah,
yeah,

123
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,420
yeah,
yeah.

124
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,190
No,
I mean,

125
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:01,970
I don't know.
I mean,

126
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:03,160
I think that,
you know,

127
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,130
I did a special,
what was it like,

128
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,850
I think it was like 2012 for showtime 
called politics where I went to DC and I

129
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:14,000
did stand up in DC and I interviewed all
Paul.

130
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,090
I love politicians.
Like that's all I watch when I come home

131
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,920
at night.
All I watch is CNN,

132
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:21,350
msn,
and Fox just because that's it.

133
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,990
Because I'm in shock and I can't believe
it.

134
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,330
No,
I just go back and forth that there's so

135
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:28,160
many fucked up things that are going on 
the world.

136
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,830
The whole North Korea thing is insane.
It's scary.

137
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,800
It's fucking insane.
But what's

138
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,860
Gary is that Donald trump is saying shit
like fire and fury that the world has 

139
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,430
never known.
Like Jesus Dude,

140
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,350
like this isn't a movie.
This is real life.

141
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Yeah,
but I mean this North Korean guys 

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,650
fucking nuts.
Fucking nuts.

143
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:47,880
It's like,
it's like,

144
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:52,881
dude,
stop shooting fucking missiles in the 

145
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:52,881
fucking.
This isn't like a playpen thing.

146
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,930
He just kept shooting missiles in the 
ocean all the time.

147
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:58,130
Like it's like he's like a kid or some 
shit and kid.

148
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,570
It's just,
I don't know,

149
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,600
it's just a,
well I think Guam is only like 2000 

150
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,520
miles away from North Korea or something
like real close.

151
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,720
So they're talking about him possibly 
bombing Guam and that's what they're 

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,290
saying now.
And I know I've been watching,

153
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,720
but it isn't a death sentence.
I mean if,

154
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,800
if we decided to attack North Korea,
it would be a death sentence to them.

155
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,960
And then also I heard,
because I know,

156
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,350
I know Dennis Rodman.
Dennis,

157
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,890
do you,
did you talk to him when he went over 

158
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:31,890
there?
I know like,

159
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,540
I don't want to get too too into it,
but I know that he goes over there a 

160
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:34,850
lot.

161
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah,
he meets with Kim Jones,

162
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,050
Aau basketball or something.
They just fucking get drunk and I don't 

163
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,980
know,
they go on jet skis or some shit.

164
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,060
Like he,
like,

165
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,250
he like,
uh,

166
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,260
um,
he likes Dennis Rodman so it brings them

167
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:53,261
out.
But from what I heard is that Kim Jong 

168
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:53,261
Goon really loves Donald Trump.
Like,

169
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,620
you know what I mean?
Like his American,

170
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,800
he loves America,
but he's kind of acting like he doesn't 

171
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,140
love America.
Like he loves the American way.

172
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,260
Look at that picture.
Yeah.

173
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,840
So my point is,
is I think I really think that if Donald

174
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,840
Trump went over there to meet with the 
guy,

175
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,470
I think that would appease him and show 
him the fuck out.

176
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,510
I think that's just my opinion.
Maybe you should be like a liaison.

177
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,190
Yeah.
See,

178
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,430
there you go.
But he gets,

179
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,070
he gets uh,
you know,

180
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,780
he goes over there and hangs out with 
them because they.

181
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,740
Kim Jong Un kid loves,
loves,

182
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,670
loves American.
Yeah.

183
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:38,000
He loves America.
And that's Kinda like a weird,

184
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,440
you know,
there's,

185
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,670
there's no,
um,

186
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,890
what's the word?
There's no,

187
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:45,620
uh,
no kind of modification.

188
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,960
Communication.
They're not communicating right.

189
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,510
You know.
Well there's language barrier obviously,

190
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,620
but it's neat.
Young.

191
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,450
Isn't Kim Jong Goon?
Like in his thirties.

192
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,710
How old is he?
Yeah,

193
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,490
he's pretty young.
It's mean.

194
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,690
Imagine running a military dictatorship 
in your thirties and he's already 

195
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,390
murdered.
A gang of people are already in.

196
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,480
The thing that's so crazy about the 
whole thing is that like you think of 

197
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,770
Isis and you think of that whole,
you know how those people like,

198
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,010
they don't care to die and they don't 
care if they're going to die and I think

199
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:15,090
that he's trained his people.
All the CBC,

200
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,390
all it's on CNN.
You this marching soldiers.

201
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,160
I think those guys are ready to die.

202
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,670
Well,
if you lived in a shit hole like North 

203
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,670
Korea where everyday you're under the 
oppressive of a military dictatorship,

204
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:30,671
maybe you'd be ready to die to you.
Like it's either escape to South Korea 

205
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:30,671
or die.
Yeah.

206
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:35,480
I,
I think what had happened is I think 

207
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,511
trump should hire Dennis Rodman and like
put like a tracking device on them and 

208
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,470
their jet skiing out in fucking the 
ocean drinking and shit.

209
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,680
And the seal team six comes in and 
fucking takes Kim Jong Buen flies into 

210
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:49,811
America,
gives all the North Korean internet and 

211
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:50,750
like sets them free.
No,

212
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,470
this is like a movie dude.
Don't you get it?

213
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,630
Was Stephen Baldwin?
No,

214
00:08:56,631 --> 00:08:59,990
but I that.
I just think that there's probably a way

215
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:00,430
to,
to,

216
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,260
to,
to,

217
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,290
to chill everything.

218
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,290
The probably is a,
which everything out.

219
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,440
This is not the way like launching test 
missiles and saying fire and fury and 

220
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,870
all that shit.
It's not,

221
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,970
not chilling anything out,
but you know,

222
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't understand what the conflict is 
about in the first place.

223
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,770
I'm not exactly sure what everybody's 
angry.

224
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,800
I think because they think that we're 
going to bomb them and we're going to 

225
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,070
bomb them like that.
We did years ago,

226
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:24,480
right.
They.

227
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,260
Well,
North Korea.

228
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,780
No,
Hiroshima was Japan.

229
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,890
The Asians,
I think.

230
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,620
I don't know the details,
so it's part of the world,

231
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:35,980
but that's cool.
That'll be super psyched.

232
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,160
Conflate the two of them.
Yeah.

233
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,300
No,
it's um,

234
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:44,920
I mean we did horrible things during the
Korean War to the North Koreans.

235
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,680
I mean that's literally the cause of all
of this.

236
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,870
All the anger and all the,
you know,

237
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,140
but that's when North Korea and South 
Korea were split and North Korea went 

238
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:57,610
communists and you know,
it's a,

239
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,650
it's all a byproduct of that.
You know,

240
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:04,651
there's,
you could read about it and actually 

241
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:04,930
there's a really good book called dear 
reader from Michael Malice.

242
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:09,931
He's a guy who was on my podcast and the
history of that part of the world is 

243
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:13,741
really fucked up,
but it's interesting because you have 

244
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:14,140
North Korea and then below you have 
South Korea,

245
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,750
South Korea,
you have a thriving economy,

246
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,770
amazing electronic Samsung.
They make all kinds of great shit over 

247
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,130
there.
And his boss,

248
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,270
probably plastic surgery,
Medica,

249
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,390
Eh,
and then North Korea is just right next 

250
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,390
door to them.
Terrible dictatorship.

251
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,170
That's fucked up man.
Well no president has been able to deal 

252
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,030
with it,
so yeah,

253
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,730
probably won't be able to mean.
How do you resolve that?

254
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,600
One of the things that my mouse was 
telling me that makes it so fucked up is

255
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,090
that everybody has to rat on everybody 
else.

256
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,040
Like say if you and I were working 
together,

257
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,280
we would have to go somewhere and tell 
someone what each one of us did wrong 

258
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,410
during the day.
Like maybe you didn't try hard enough 

259
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,490
when somebody died or maybe you weren't 
excited enough,

260
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,780
but something good happened.
He didn't cheer loud enough and they'll,

261
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:04,780
they'll rat you out for that and then 
you know,

262
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:08,700
you have to be accountable and then so 
they have like a culture of rats.

263
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,080
Everybody's ratting everybody out.
That

264
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,430
sounds fun.
We don't realize how lucky we are,

265
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,950
you know,
to live in America would do.

266
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,080
It's one of the reasons why people 
complained so much about stuff because 

267
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,220
we're so soft.
Any slight little thing that's wrong.

268
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,100
You ever been to prison before?
No,

269
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,090
never.
Well,

270
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,750
I went to Alcatraz,
but just to visit as a uh,

271
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,120
never been arrested.
I always think like spending time in 

272
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,361
prison would make you appreciate just 
the simple things because you always 

273
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:39,660
see,
you always see like,

274
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,110
you know,
people that are incarcerated,

275
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,630
they get out and they like see the 
sunlight and they're like,

276
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:45,310
oh my God,
this is fucking awesome.

277
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,330
And part of me is like,
I think everyone should go to prison for

278
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:54,040
like a month just to kind of get that,

279
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,560
get their normal freedoms taken away 
from them.

280
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,040
You know,
I'm actually doing a benefit and I was 

281
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,051
going to ask you if you want to do.
I don't know if you're in town at the 

282
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:04,390
comedy store for the innocence project.
Are you familiar with them?

283
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,380
Yeah,
I am.

284
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,760
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it on August 27th.

285
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,440
At least people that are incarcerated.
Innocent.

286
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

287
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:13,200
So if you want to do it,
I got it.

288
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,350
Everyone's doing it already.
That's August 27th and it's for,

289
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:22,351
you know,
Barry Scheck and that whole team of 

290
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:22,351
people that,
that exonerate,

291
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,340
you know,
people that go to prison for crimes they

292
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,810
didn't commit,
you know,

293
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,790
that whole thing,
right?

294
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,320
Yeah.
Well I'm flying in from DC.

295
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh,
that's on Sunday.

296
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,040
Yeah,
yeah,

297
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,100
yeah,
I could do that.

298
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,410
That'd be great.
Yeah,

299
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,230
I'll do it.
Yeah,

300
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,760
that'd be great.
I got a great lineup.

301
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,410
I got um,
everyone's on it already,

302
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:40,810
but I was going to ask you.
I'm sure he'd be into that.

303
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,210
That'd be seen the night before.
Oh,

304
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,040
cool.
I'm flying in trouble yet,

305
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,010
so I want to raise money for them.
Yeah,

306
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,100
because I want to give.
I want to give money back to these guys 

307
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,960
because when they got into jail they 
don't have anything and they're not 

308
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,710
given anything given like a dollar,
you know what I mean?

309
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,960
I know.
And then they have to somehow or another

310
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:03,961
figure out how to sue to get some 
compensation for the fact they were 

311
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:07,411
wrongly in prison.
But how'd you like to be in prison for 

312
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,631
20 years knowing you had nothing to do 
with it and there's people that are in 

313
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:10,300
prison for killing your mom and stuff 
like that.

314
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,760
Imagine someone kills your mom.
It's not you.

315
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,620
And then you get arrested and go to jail
for it.

316
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,690
Yeah.
No,

317
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,700
it's terrible.
But the fruit person at the end of the 

318
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,100
bar is pretty cool.
You gonna eat here just for a year.

319
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,820
Okay.
Did you see blood sugar's so low.

320
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:26,410
You're like,
I can't,

321
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,330
I can't wait 15 minutes.
No.

322
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,490
But did you see the fruit man at the 
corner?

323
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,540
No,
I did not.

324
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,700
There's a fruit snack,
a little Mexican fruit.

325
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:34,900
Guys,
chop the fruit.

326
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,210
Don't tell ice.
Sorry.

327
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,700
Yeah,
we'll pull that guy across the border.

328
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,890
Bring them back.
Yeah.

329
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,030
So,
um,

330
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,120
how did you,
what was the thought process behind 

331
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,090
doing an impression of this dude?
It's gone viral.

332
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,170
It's over a million hits now,
right?

333
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

334
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,060
It's like at a million seven around 
that.

335
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:56,170
Yeah.
And it's,

336
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:57,670
uh,
it's caught on.

337
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,070
It's just,
I don't know.

338
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:03,480
You've been doing this,
you've been doing this a long time.

339
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,010
We did the makeup for you.
How did they do it?

340
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,040
A Guy,
uh,

341
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,650
um,
you know,

342
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,870
the business statue of Liberty facts.
Yeah.

343
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:14,080
You just do these things and certain 
things catch on.

344
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:17,440
Certain things don't get John and in 
this thing caught on.

345
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,450
So I don't know,
I was pretty stoked.

346
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,100
Is that him back in the day?
That's him now.

347
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,810
He doesn't look like that now though.
He's way more bold than that.

348
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,890
No.
Yeah,

349
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,050
he's um,
um,

350
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,880
but yeah,
no,

351
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,080
it was cool.
It was a,

352
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,920
I,
I've done stuff with them before.

353
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,440
I actually did a,
an anthony wiener sketch to,

354
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,540
I don't know if you saw that one.
Yeah,

355
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,670
it's pretty cool.
I did that when I play Anthony Wiener.

356
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:48,160
I did that about four or five,
six months ago.

357
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,950
And then this thing came up,
they just hit me up,

358
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,980
then,
you know,

359
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,070
I do stuff for funny or die sometimes 
and in this thing caught on and it went 

360
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,020
everywhere and I was on CNN and in,
in,

361
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,370
uh,
you know,

362
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:02,090
every,
you know,

363
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,330
even political,
a political,

364
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:10,331
um,
sites picked it up the hill and all 

365
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:10,331
these different places picked it up.

366
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:10,970
So I don't know,
I just did it.

367
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,850
And they know what I mean.
Yeah.

368
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,190
Just do shit.
And like,

369
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,900
you don't know what the fuck.
So it was.

370
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,380
Yeah,
it was funny.

371
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:21,800
I saw the weird thing too.
Wiener I think is a comic.

372
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,230
He's hilarious.
I think he's a comic.

373
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,700
He just doesn't.
He doesn't know it.

374
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,950
I mean,
he's still committed to being the.

375
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,160
I mean,
he tried to be the mayor and he can't 

376
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,160
eat.
If it wasn't the latest scandal,

377
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,910
he would've come close a hundred 
percent.

378
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,410
Yeah.
And did you see his,

379
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:37,610
uh,
his documentary?

380
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,830
Yes.
Grazing spoke.

381
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,630
It's amazing.
It's so fucked up.

382
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,700
So you see I'm lasting.
OKC didn't give him any eating given any

383
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,710
edible.
I'm not going to give at this point in 

384
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,710
the Joe Diaz.
I was like,

385
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,710
dude,
I got to go.

386
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,790
He kept asking me questions.
I couldn't answer anything.

387
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No,
I wasn't going to do is to imagine if 

388
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,220
everybody that I know do that too.
Every time cigarette to the two I did 

389
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,310
two red bed.
Doesn't tell anyone,

390
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,350
but I've heard everyone kind of can't 
handle it.

391
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,150
Most people.
Well,

392
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:08,630
the numbers of Joey puts up.
No very few humans can handle it,

393
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,730
you know?
But don't you think back to Anthony 

394
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,120
Wiener?
I think that guy should have been a 

395
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,561
comic.
Like he's got this idea about what's 

396
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,871
good and what's bad,
but he's also a pervert under like the 

397
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:19,970
guise of comic Yo.
He's a great speaker.

398
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,010
He's hilarious.
He's hilarious.

399
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,210
He obviously loves posting.
Honestly was supposed to.

400
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,560
I mean he's,
he's a fucking character.

401
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,830
I mean,
I just think that he's trapped in that 

402
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,310
suppressed world of being a politician 
where he obviously doesn't fit those 

403
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:41,621
standards,
those standards of behavior that they 

404
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:41,900
demand of you that are all bullshit 
anyway,

405
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,490
but he's too fucked up.

406
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,490
He's too crazy.
I think the more fucked up things that 

407
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,240
people find out about the politicians,
the more popular they become.

408
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,040
Some of them I mean,
right?

409
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,170
Yeah,
I mean in a way clean about it.

410
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:57,130
If he could come clean about all of it 
until like the,

411
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,640
but still in the day of trump things way
different.

412
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Right?
Because trump got elected a month after 

413
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,521
that,
grabbed them by the pussy thing came 

414
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:09,521
out.
Everybody thought that was gonna sink as

415
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:09,800
both like that's it.
And he still wins.

416
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,400
So I think the world is different,
but I don't think wiener has the 

417
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,330
constitution that trump has trump say 
what you want about them,

418
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:20,790
but the motherfucker as teflon for skin 
things just saying bounce right off.

419
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,270
Doesn't give a shit.
Just like.

420
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,700
Yeah.
Insane.

421
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

422
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,280
I,
I,

423
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:28,220
um,
I know him from back in the day.

424
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

425
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,040
I mean you have to understand I've been 
doing this.

426
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,480
How long have you been doing it?
Thirty years.

427
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,380
Twenty nine?
Yeah.

428
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:36,150
So I've been doing it 30 years.
When did you come to the store with ir?

429
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,030
Ninety four.
Ninety four?

430
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,190
Yeah.
So you were there.

431
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,660
Is that when he came to the store?
Yeah,

432
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,980
94.
Ninety four.

433
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:44,510
I became a paid regular.
Wow.

434
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,030
Yeah.
So I was um,

435
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,130
I was doing spring break for

436
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,840
MTV.
When was it?

437
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,970
It was like 89,
90,

438
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:55,410
91,
92.

439
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,970
And it was,
you know,

440
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,660
obviously the biggest thing in the world
because it was live and there's hundreds

441
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:04,420
of thousands of jobs.
I did spring break in $2,000

442
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:05,830
for an MTV.
Okay.

443
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,980
Right.
When it was sort of like,

444
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,970
oh,
well,

445
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,660
yeah.
And um,

446
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,730
and we did it and it was,
I'm Hawaiian tropics or the biggest 

447
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:21,771
thing in the world.
All the girls and Fabio was there and 

448
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,020
Jon Lovitz was there.
Vince Neil was there,

449
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:30,021
Kennison was there.
Rodney Dangerfield was there and Donald 

450
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:33,321
trump was there.
And because Donald trump used to go to 

451
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,801
the Hawaiian Hawaiian tropic parties 
that Ron Rice used to throw after the 

452
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:39,510
spring break things.
And Donald Trump was,

453
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,820
I knew him back then.
So.

454
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:45,600
And then I saw him probably about a 
couple times at the playboy mansion.

455
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,770
The last time I saw him at the playboy 
mansion I think was about four years ago

456
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,400
and he was just there just hanging out,
just hanging like Bill Maher,

457
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,000
you know what I mean?

458
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,380
Just fucking,
just fucking hanging.

459
00:18:57,381 --> 00:19:02,381
It was,
it was actually in the afternoon and I 

460
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,671
think it was like a Sunday fun day thing
or it was like some like Easter egg 

461
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,860
night day or some shit.
And he was just buzzing around and in 

462
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,990
this suit and just talking to girls and,
and um,

463
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,220
yeah,
him and Oj,

464
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,560
you know.
Oh,

465
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,520
LJ,
Lj will be out to.

466
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
I know it was bizarre.
So what,

467
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,050
what does Donald Trump like when you're 
hanging around with them?

468
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,130
He just likes vagina,
you know what I mean?

469
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,720
Like he just like us,
you know,

470
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:28,260
like,
you know,

471
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:29,820
he's looking at those babies are,
you know,

472
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:34,821
it was always like that.
I mean that's why anyone go to the 

473
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:36,180
playboy mansion because they liked 
vagina and we were lucky to get into the

474
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,280
playboy mansion.
We were very fortunate,

475
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,990
you know what I mean,
to get in there.

476
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,600
And um,
but it was so,

477
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,660
you know,
and I was actually talking to Kellyanne 

478
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,821
conway about um,
right before trump got elected on email 

479
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,170
and I was supposed to have dinner with 
her and some of her friends,

480
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,750
but I had to go do some shows in west 
palm at the Improv,

481
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,780
so I had to cancel out to talk to 
Kellyanne Conway about,

482
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,530
just to be there.
Of course,

483
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,170
have a weird.
We've been a hilarious.

484
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,520
I wanted to,
you know what I mean?

485
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,230
For sure.
But she was cool.

486
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:12,231
We run it.
I have her email ever information that 

487
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:12,231
stuff.
Yeah.

488
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:12,880
You should get her on your show.
You put her on your show.

489
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,980
Oh yeah,
I would definitely talk to her.

490
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,680
Does it feel weird though to be 
connected to them now?

491
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,020
What happened?
Eventually ends.

492
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:19,620
Yeah,
once,

493
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:20,730
yeah.
Once she got.

494
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,080
Once they got in and I started to see 
all that stuff that was going on,

495
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:26,730
I kind of like backed off and I was 
like,

496
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,050
hmm.
You know what I mean?

497
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,580
Yeah.
I didn't want to really be,

498
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:34,581
you know,
but I want to be the vagina coordinator 

499
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:35,460
for him.
That was like hooks it up.

500
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,720
Yeah.
That gets some vaginal.

501
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,640
Can't be public about that.
Can't talk about it.

502
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,500
So if we talk about you gonna fuck it up
for him.

503
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,880
Oh,
that's true right now.

504
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:44,640
You're fucking it up for them just a bit
folks.

505
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,140
Yeah,
we're just nail Polish.

506
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,790
But how great would that be?
The idea is that he's got the trump 

507
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:53,790
plane,
you know the trump plane.

508
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,800
It's sitting there.
It was.

509
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,570
Where is it sitting somewhere,
right?

510
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,590
Where is that?
It's got to be sitting in like on a 

511
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,791
tarmac somewhere.
So I want him to let me borrow it so I 

512
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,480
can pick up vagina from in the Midwest.
The Midwest is the move.

513
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,220
Well you had the people that voted for 
him.

514
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,650
They're happy for him.
Yeah.

515
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:13,280
That have the flyover states bring some,
you know,

516
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,710
one tooth wanders,
bringing,

517
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,840
bringing them to the da because dude,
he hasn't gotten anything.

518
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,390
Think about it,
but he's been like cutoff.

519
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,030
Strange hundred percent.
Do you think?

520
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:29,200
So there's like a basement that they 
have in the White House.

521
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,860
There's no way he's getting vagina,
but.

522
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,470
So none of them do you think?
None of the presidents with modern 

523
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,550
presidents like I guess like Bush on,
right Bush,

524
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,170
Obama,
now trump.

525
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,750
There's no way they can write.
I don't think so.

526
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,360
Clinton kind of fucked it up for 
everybody.

527
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,320
Know who is it?
Linda TRIPP said the lady who ran it,

528
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,870
that Monica Lewinsky girl out of poor 
girl,

529
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,750
I feel more bad for her than anybody.
Like she,

530
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,940
she.
There was some article about her where 

531
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:00,940
she said the shame sticks to you,
like tar.

532
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,050
Imagine poor girl,
which is 20 years old at this point.

533
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,090
I guess she's got it right.
You know what I mean?

534
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,260
Yeah.
But so what does trump like those,

535
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,690
you a good guy to talk to?
Like what is he like?

536
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,550
Obviously he hadn't,
he didn't want to run for president 

537
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:20,550
back.
Yeah.

538
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,180
I think he had been wanting to.
I mean if you look at clips now you see 

539
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,851
a lot of clips where he was,
where they interview them and now about 

540
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:27,880
like you find clips in the nineties 
where they always say,

541
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,800
who is it?

542
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,090
The guy from?
Um,

543
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,610
I forgot that one.
Sean Msn,

544
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,000
but tim something.
I Dunno,

545
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,980
he died.
But um,

546
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:36,700
he says,
well,

547
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:38,440
if you were president that uh,
oh yeah,

548
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,570
meet the press.
Yeah,

549
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,680
yeah,
yeah,

550
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:42,880
yeah.
Actually I was watching that today where

551
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:47,881
he was talking about North Korea.
It was a little clip where he's talking 

552
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:48,010
about North Korea for your 19,
99.

553
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,730
And I never really engaged in like heavy
conversation with him.

554
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:53,420
It was always kind of just,
you know,

555
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,540
we smiled at each other.
It was just that,

556
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,230
you know,
so I never like went out to dinner with 

557
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,230
them or anything.
But yeah,

558
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,990
I was supposed to do celebrity 
apprentice.

559
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:07,170
They asked me to do celebrity apprentice
when they had the second integration of 

560
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,730
fear factor when fear factor came back 
and like,

561
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,650
what is it,
2011 or 12 or whatever it was.

562
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,860
And um,
I just was like,

563
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:15,670
I don't want to do it.

564
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,770
I just want,
I don't want to be in New York for three

565
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,600
months.
I don't want to work on this show.

566
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,610
It just seems kind of gross.
And now that I think about it,

567
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,910
Mike is probably a good move because 
like,

568
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:27,420
what if I did it and I'm like got in an 
argument with,

569
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,230
with him,
like,

570
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,240
what if he hated me?
Right now I have this fucking feud like 

571
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,801
rosie does because Rosie O'donnell,
it seems like it consumes her like her 

572
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:40,120
fucking twitter feed.
Is it still?

573
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,910
Oh my God,
that's all.

574
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,490
She's always tweeting about trump being 
piece of shit and a loser.

575
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,950
And He tweets about her.
That's hilarious.

576
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,180
They're grown people.
Yeah.

577
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,510
More right there.
Look at that.

578
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,300
Oh Donald looking bad honey.
Wow.

579
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,020
Take time to take care of you.
It's only Wednesday golf sweetie.

580
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,040
Golf.
That's hilarious.

581
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,330
Oh my God.
How can she say anything about anybody 

582
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,930
looking bad?
That's what's even more dumb.

583
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,680
Shit.
She's crazy.

584
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,700
I don't know.
It's just like feuds like that.

585
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,770
They're not healthy.
They consume you.

586
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,720
Not Good.
Not Good.

587
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,020
I'm not good at all.
So you're going to continue doing this 

588
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,020
dude,
what's his name again?

589
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,690
Steven Miller.
Um,

590
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,280
I guess if he keeps messing up and they 
want me to do it.

591
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:37,270
Yeah.
You could do a whole bunch of things 

592
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:37,270
with Tim.
Right.

593
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:37,270
And him explaining things to different 
people.

594
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,740
I think it's more if he messes up.
Yeah.

595
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,710
You know what I mean?
I think it's more if he goes on,

596
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:46,970
you know,
I just wanted them to get back on that 

597
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:46,970
press stage because once he's on there,
then they start,

598
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,410
you know what I mean?
And that's when he,

599
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,320
that's when he becomes,
you know,

600
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,730
was weird as is.
When George Bush was president,

601
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,480
you know,
uh,

602
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:57,380
I was doing some shows in DC and me and 
Dean Gilbert,

603
00:24:57,381 --> 00:25:02,381
we went to a,
we went to the White House and we 

604
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:05,051
actually went into that room,
the pressroom and it's actually like 

605
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:05,051
fucking small.

606
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,740
It's pretty little.
Have you been in it?

607
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,360
No,
but I've seen it on TV when they show up

608
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:09,220
from the back of the room.
Yeah.

609
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,450
But it's,
it's almost like this big.

610
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:13,160
It's pretty small.
I was like,

611
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:14,780
whoa.
You know what I mean?

612
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,090
It's weird.
It was to be grand.

613
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

614
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,600
But the,
the White House,

615
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,050
did he,
have you been to the White House before?

616
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,820
No,
just the tourists walk there.

617
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,080
I know.
It's fucking weird.

618
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,050
I'm sure it's so weird.
You know what's weird is how close it is

619
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,740
to this street.
It goes by it,

620
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,380
uh,
drove by.

621
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:35,390
But,
but that was back when people had 

622
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:35,390
muskets,
you know,

623
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,310
like they really couldn't.
When they built that stupid fucking 

624
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,540
thing,
they didn't give them enough space.

625
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,150
If somebody just pulled up at a high 
powered rifle,

626
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,540
it's right there.
It's just weird that people like you 

627
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,510
watch house of cards.
It's a great show,

628
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,990
but it's so,
it's weird because they're engaging in 

629
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,290
all sorts of illicit activity and 
there's windows everywhere.

630
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,590
It's probably unrealistic but,
but um,

631
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,470
how many people have lived in that 
fucking house?

632
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,640
That's what's even weirder.
You know,

633
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,220
45 different presidents all live in this
one spot.

634
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,020
I know,
it's crazy.

635
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,360
I mean they have to be saying that shit 
to each other.

636
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:17,020
I mean,
Bill Clinton or trump's got to be 

637
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,020
saying,
there it is.

638
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,840
Trump started saying like,
this is the place that Bill Clinton got 

639
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,200
blown.
This is the area.

640
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,470
Look how close it is.
Let go look in the left side.

641
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:26,780
And the right side,
look how close it is to the street.

642
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,870
I guarantee you I can hit that with a,
with an arrow.

643
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,330
You're going to DC,
right?

644
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,530
Yeah.
And you've done there August 27th.

645
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,680
Do you like dc?
I like working there.

646
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,020
Yeah,
because they feel like they need to blow

647
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:40,490
some steam off.
Like they're,

648
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,290
they're kind of wild.
The kind of fun,

649
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,500
you know.
Hey,

650
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,010
as far as

651
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,010
your standup and stuff like you know,
obviously you know where peers you 

652
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,361
don't.
And I see you and watch you and stuff 

653
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:53,361
like that.
At what point did,

654
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,890
did your stuff like just really start to
blow up?

655
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,250
Do you know what I mean?
Like really go from clubs because you're

656
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,120
working in clubs,
like I'm working clubs and then all of a

657
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:02,580
sudden you now you're working like 
bigger places.

658
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,710
Like at what point was it about five 
years ago?

659
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:05,640
Four years ago?

660
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,130
Well,
was it the Netflix specials?

661
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,310
Did,
uh,

662
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,750
did theaters in some places.
But um,

663
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:17,720
it's probably,
mine is all started changing in 2009.

664
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,390
That's when I did a comedy central 
special on Spike TV first.

665
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,150
And then the TV and then comedy central.
Yeah.

666
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,300
I started doing bigger places.
Then I started selling out theaters.

667
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:32,590
Have like 2000 seats in some markets,
but you know,

668
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:35,520
take me like a few months.
And then um,

669
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,720
then there was the next comedy central 
special.

670
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:42,721
That was another big bump.
Then I was selling out places like the 

671
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:43,460
Belko in Denver,
which is like 5,000.

672
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,560
Wow.
But it takes,

673
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,600
it would take a little longer to sell 
out.

674
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,990
But now with the Netflix special changed
everything that Netflix is just a 

675
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,400
completely different thing.
Wow.

676
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,540
There's so many people have Netflix,
man I know.

677
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,210
And if you're special,
you know,

678
00:27:58,211 --> 00:28:00,340
and then you,
you really put together something good,

679
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,340
they can say,
oh,

680
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:02,320
you know,
this guy,

681
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,140
he actually is a real comic.
Really asked actually it's funny,

682
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,630
you know.
And then they want to come see you and 

683
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,630
then it's your responsibility to not 
fuck them.

684
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,890
Make sure you do a good job and keep 
writing new shit.

685
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,290
Constantly keep producing new shit.
Right.

686
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,530
But what does it feel like to be out of 
the clubs?

687
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,910
I still do clubs though.
I know that you're in,

688
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,850
you're playing bigger things bigger.
What does that feel like to,

689
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:25,740
you said Dope.
It's

690
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,850
great.
I mean it's fun and everything.

691
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:29,220
Like it's a different kind of show 
though.

692
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:34,480
It's like there's more pausing and yes,
it's more theatrical year.

693
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,580
It's a bigger stage moving around more.
There's really good to it.

694
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,330
But um,
I wouldn't say it's better,

695
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,820
it's just different.
It's better financially.

696
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,080
Yeah.
But it's a,

697
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,970
it's just different,
you know,

698
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,210
that must make you feel good.
It feels good.

699
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

700
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,820
That's awesome.
Because I played,

701
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,040
I played big places and I've also played
clubs,

702
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:57,350
but now I'm mostly playing.
I played clubs.

703
00:28:57,351 --> 00:28:58,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

704
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,840
So,
you know,

705
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,310
play all the same clubs.
Yeah.

706
00:29:01,311 --> 00:29:03,170
Like client playing clubs though.
Yes.

707
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,690
It's connected to the people.
It's intimate,

708
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:06,590
you know?
Yeah.

709
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,680
How often do you turn?
Mm,

710
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,680
I don't know.
I kind of go in spurts,

711
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,360
you know,
I'm working a lot.

712
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,420
I mean I don't work a lot at the store 
during the week because I'm like so 

713
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,520
exhausted from editing and I edit and 
edit all day long and editing.

714
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,920
I'm editing,
I'm well,

715
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:27,410
I finished the show and crackle that 
was,

716
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
took a long time,
that show that's on now,

717
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:33,620
that's on crackle and editing that and 
that,

718
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,650
you know,
I spent a lot of time on those videos 

719
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:38,650
and then from there,
um,

720
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,670
I did the documentary Polisher,
stands alone,

721
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,150
which was on showtime and now it's on 
Amazon.

722
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,640
That's just the straight doc that came 
out a couple of years ago.

723
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,450
I had such a good time filming that,
that I kept shooting in.

724
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:52,210
The whole thing is about me moving my 
mom out of the house,

725
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,770
you know,
out of the big house because when I did 

726
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,481
the original docket was just kinda like 
kind of skimming the concept of that.

727
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:01,690
And then I go,
fuck,

728
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:04,630
I got to start doing that.
So I cut into it.

729
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,650
It's a six part series,
almost like my version of making the 

730
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:09,670
murder,
but I don't kill anyone obviously,

731
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,000
you know,
but it's a six part series based off the

732
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:18,001
original doc.
So we've been putting that together and 

733
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:19,000
that's fucking dope.
Dude might not know.

734
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,920
So I think we posted second dope.

735
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,160
Your mom's probably one of the most 
important,

736
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,670
if not the most important characters 
ever in the history of standup comedy,

737
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,830
like her running and owning the comedy 
store in the glory days of Kinison and 

738
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,670
prior and now today even,
you know,

739
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:38,910
like she,
she set the stage,

740
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:44,510
you know,
I mean at all the people that helped me 

741
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,600
and like were important to me and my 
career.

742
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,080
Your mom was pretty uniquely 
significant,

743
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,040
you know,
she,

744
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,870
she,
um,

745
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,020
she created,
you know,

746
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,810
my dad and mom started the place in 
[inaudible] 72.

747
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,160
I was four and then it's so crazy.
Yeah.

748
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:04,520
And then they got divorced.
She won the comedy store in the divorce.

749
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:06,320
He says he gave it to her,
you know,

750
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:08,720
there's still like a friction there with
that concept.

751
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:09,470
I wasn't,
you know,

752
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:14,471
I don't remember.
I was a fucking four years old and then 

753
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:16,370
my mom became who she really was.
You know,

754
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:17,630
you're a comic.
I'm a comedy.

755
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:22,631
That's who we are.
She became a creative kind of force and 

756
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,980
she came in at the limelight at a time 
where everyone needed someone like that.

757
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,250
You know what I mean?
Like instead of just like a club owner,

758
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,990
you know,
she was creative,

759
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,320
you know,
that's why I think part of the reason 

760
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,851
why she's sick now is because she's not,
she was never like a real business 

761
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:37,010
business person,
you know,

762
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:39,500
she's,
she was a woman so it was really hard.

763
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,800
So.
But she was so good at fucking like 

764
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,320
Roseanne wear suspenders,
you know,

765
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,470
Gary Shanley put a sweater on,
you know what I mean?

766
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:51,290
Just different things that she would 
help develop.

767
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,570
And that to me is what the store is 
missing now.

768
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,800
Do you understand?
There's no mixing.

769
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,780
There's no Mitzi shore there to really 
garnish these comments.

770
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:02,270
I Love Adam to death.
It just fucking doing an awesome job,

771
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,310
but it's not Mitzi shore.
And that to me is something that I think

772
00:32:07,311 --> 00:32:10,110
we have to do.
I think it's our responsibility,

773
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:12,830
you know,
to kind of give back to younger guys and

774
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:17,831
maybe spend a little more time there on 
a Monday night or something and really 

775
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:21,131
kind of help these kids out and give 
them some direction because there is no 

776
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:21,320
direction.
There's no Mitzi shore there.

777
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,100
Um,
so that's who she is,

778
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,150
that's who she was,
that's who she is.

779
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:31,150
And,
and that to me is what her best quality 

780
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:31,220
quality was when,
when she first met my dad,

781
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:35,050
it was in the fifties and my dad was a 
touring comic and uh,

782
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,090
my dad did a show and a or a summer in a
place called Outcart Lake Wisconsin and 

783
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,900
he was doing all summer.
It's like,

784
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,550
that's what you did in the fifties,
you would play there.

785
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:48,551
The whole,
it was a camp and my mom worked for the 

786
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:53,531
boss of the camp and my mom used to type
my dad's jokes in the back.

787
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,750
Yeah,
she would type the jokes in the back.

788
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,800
No,
this is good,

789
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,150
that's good.
You know.

790
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,800
And she would write it down.
Wow.

791
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,450
And then she would say,
this stunk,

792
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:03,950
this was good,
that was good.

793
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:08,951
That's not good.
And then she just developed my help del 

794
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:08,951
Valle,
my dad's act,

795
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:13,180
they started dating,
they had sex and then my dad took off 

796
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,410
and then he was in Toledo,
Ohio and then got a call from my mom 

797
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,080
saying I'm pregnant with Scott.

798
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,430
And Scott's just turned 64,
65 years old.

799
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,840
So,
um,

800
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,130
so back then you have a kid whether you 
want to or you don't,

801
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,830
you know what I mean?
The abortion thing didn't really exist.

802
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,120
I mean it did,
I'm sure.

803
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:36,140
But he didn't never wanted a kid and he 
never wanted to get married and he never

804
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,870
wanted all of his kids.
He didn't want us.

805
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:40,850
He just wanted to do what I was doing 
what I do,

806
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,730
which was just bang vagina on the road,
have a good time,

807
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,470
you know,
which is which,

808
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,570
which was when my mom,
when I first started,

809
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,790
you know what I mean?
And that got taken from him.

810
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:55,030
So in his day,
do you ever talk to them about what it 

811
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,361
was like to tour back then?
Because it wasn't really comedy clubs 

812
00:33:58,361 --> 00:33:58,361
back then,
right?

813
00:33:58,361 --> 00:33:59,540
No,
it was more like a strip club.

814
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

815
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,100
Was bars,
bowling alleys,

816
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,870
you know,
places that I play now.

817
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,980
But I had to be a real trip to,
uh,

818
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:13,370
go from that to being a part of the 
original comedy club.

819
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,580
I mean,
other than like the Ice House right now 

820
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:18,580
is the oldest comedy club in the 
country.

821
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,530
Um,
but because that's because it started in

822
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:26,080
like 1960,
but the store was it 72.

823
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:29,960
So would you say it's incredible.
Really stop and think about that.

824
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:32,030
How long ago that was?
Before that,

825
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:33,020
there wasn't really.
Well,

826
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:38,021
the New York at the Improv in New York,
there was catch a rising star in New 

827
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:38,120
York.
One was that,

828
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,820
that was sort of around that time.
Yeah,

829
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,040
it was a new thing.
Yeah.

830
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,050
So like your mom and your dad?
Well,

831
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:46,850
my,
my dad,

832
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,060
the way it,
the way it happened was frank 

833
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,550
[inaudible] who owns the building,
who owned the building,

834
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,170
said to my dad and his friend Rudy 
Deluca said,

835
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:00,200
Hey Sammy,
you want to start a comedy room?

836
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,910
Because he owned the building where 
Ciro's is.

837
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,940
And that whole,
that whole,

838
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,290
that whole building there with the room 
right there.

839
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,300
The original room actually,
which was,

840
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,090
which was it?
Which was what it was originally.

841
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,920
And my dad said,
okay,

842
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:14,450
and then Rudy,
my dad's,

843
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,010
my dad's a writing partner.
Rudy Deluca said,

844
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,340
well,
what do we call it?

845
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,420
You know,
let's do it.

846
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,670
And then my dad was like,
let's call it the Sammy shore room.

847
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,060
Right?
And then he's like,

848
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:27,590
that's fucking stupid,
you know what I mean,

849
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:32,591
we're not going to do that.
And then they asked my mom and my mom's 

850
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:33,260
the one that said,
let's call it the comedy store.

851
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,540
So she's the one who came up with the 
name.

852
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,050
So they started the comedy store.
My Dad was like the Alcoholic Mc,

853
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,370
you know,
when he was partying,

854
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:43,320
it was a fucking alcoholic dude.
Big Time.

855
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,740
Like he loved Jmb was his favorite drink
and he would go on stage and um,

856
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,470
he'd bring up Red Fox,
Pat Mccormick,

857
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,940
you know,
um,

858
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,830
you know,
Lynn Marie Langston,

859
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,240
you know,
all these guys.

860
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:59,330
Yeah.
And my mom would work the cover booth,

861
00:35:59,331 --> 00:35:59,610
you know,
we're,

862
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,250
Tommy used to work in that little area 
right there.

863
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:04,500
And she used to give out like,
um,

864
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,030
like little,
um,

865
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,830
peppermints and stuff,
you know,

866
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:11,520
to the guests that would come in.
And then my dad would go on the road and

867
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:16,521
open for Elvis and open for um,
Inglebert Humperdink and Sammy Davis and

868
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,700
Sinatra and all these people.
And my mom's always started to take over

869
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:22,920
the club while he was gone,
like her heart,

870
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,610
you know what I mean?

871
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,450
She,
her,

872
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,840
she put her heart into the club and 
that's Kinda where it started.

873
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:31,620
And they were never happy to begin with.
They were never happy.

874
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,880
So it was time for the divorce.
And then my dad just gave her the club,

875
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,020
gave her the house and took off.
So he wanted to be back on the road yet.

876
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:45,021
But he's to this day,
he's fucking pissed about it because he 

877
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:47,220
never got a piece of the comedy store.
He never got a piece of the commentator.

878
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,760
And I think that's terrible because he's
the one that fucking started it.

879
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,070
If it wasn't for him,
there would be no comedy story.

880
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,880
If he never had sex with my mom in 
Elkhart Lake,

881
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Wisconsin,
there would never be no comedy store 

882
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:01,880
period.
Deep period.

883
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,320
So that's why my dad needs to get more,
in my opinion,

884
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,670
needs to get more credit.
He's,

885
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,150
he doesn't eat,
never gets any credit.

886
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,530
So always or never met him.
I've never met.

887
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:14,370
Who Does fucking man is the man,
I believe you just fucking awesome.

888
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,300
I'm 90 years old.
Did when you were,

889
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:21,660
when you were growing up,
did Kennison really babysit you?

890
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:27,350
That ever really happened?
Because that was always like tell you 

891
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:27,540
who the babysitters were.
Kennison never babysat me.

892
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:31,500
The babysitters were like lowest 
Bromfield Jack Purdue like binder.

893
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:33,490
August Hamilton,
Mitchell Walters.

894
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:39,060
I'm ally finder from vsr like binder was
fucking awesome.

895
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:40,950
Good.
He was awesome.

896
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:46,050
He used to take me to little league at 
the Beverly Hills Park.

897
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:46,860
Yeah.
And uh,

898
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,620
but Mike Binder,
Mike binders,

899
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:54,621
fucking.
He was like the one of him and Alan 

900
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:54,621
Bursky were like the youngest guys that 
came on the scene.

901
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:56,000
But Mike Binder,
um,

902
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,040
he used to take me to skate parks and 
all that shit because my mom was busy at

903
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:02,310
the club so she always gave me the 
comedians as far as Kennison.

904
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,760
I was a short order cook at the comedy 
store in Westwood.

905
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,090
I used to cook for everyone.
There's 200 people there because I was a

906
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:13,230
good cook because my parents divorced 
and I took care of the whole.

907
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:14,100
I make,
not I,

908
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,500
there's like a menu in my mom's office.
Polly's menu,

909
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,690
not chose hamburgers.
Everything.

910
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:22,770
I would cook really good and that's 
where I first met Sam was 14.

911
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:28,690
He was like the doorman there.
You were working there as a cook at 14 

912
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,030
because I wanted to save up for a 
saltwater fish tank because my mom 

913
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,900
wouldn't buy me a saltwater fish tank.
Wow.

914
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:37,780
I wanted to get 100 gallon fish tank 
when I came around in [inaudible] 94.

915
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:39,910
I don't think the Westwood Club was 
around now.

916
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,950
When did it?
Does I think 84?

917
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,750
Uh.
Wow.

918
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,160
Yeah,
that's too bad.

919
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:48,010
I heard that place was wild.
It was like the bastard club.

920
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,200
It was like where everyone,
you know,

921
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:52,600
like,
I mean our sineal powered regus,

922
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:57,601
Andrew dice clay.
They would go there and it was like off 

923
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:57,601
the beat.
Yeah.

924
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:01,911
And then work out there.
And then like the Howie Mendel is would 

925
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:01,911
be in the main room at the store and all
that stuff.

926
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:02,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

927
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,660
Even back then.
Isn't that crazy?

928
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:06,320
He was fucking awesome.
It was huge.

929
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,730
Huge.
It's weird seeing him on all these game 

930
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,211
shows and stuff like that.
He went up on a comedy store the other 

931
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:15,670
night and I heard someone say,
he does comedy.

932
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:16,900
I was like,
wow,

933
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:18,280
that's so weird.
Like people,

934
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:23,810
they don't even think about it.
You see them on television as a host of 

935
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,190
a game show.
You kind of forget that he was this huge

936
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,380
standards before ever.
You did it?

937
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,460
Yeah.
Huge.

938
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:31,930
Before he used to put a glove or was 
hadn't blow it up with his nose.

939
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,700
He would play that little kid that bobby
about.

940
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:36,360
It was great.
Yeah,

941
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,080
he did.
He actually did a cartoon.

942
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,030
Bobby's world,
right?

943
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,980
Yeah.
I know.

944
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:43,240
It's a weird.
It's a weird,

945
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:46,990
like I was at the funny or die thing 
last night and I was with will ferrell,

946
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:49,080
not to drop names,
but I'm a huge fan of him and,

947
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,700
and he owns the site and we were talking
and,

948
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,920
and he just gave it up to me.
He's like,

949
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:54,970
dude,
you started at all,

950
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,910
you know and see because I used to watch
you on MTV and it seen Amanda.

951
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,170
This generation doesn't know what I did.
Most of the kits,

952
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,240
the 25 and younger,
they don't know that I started at MTV.

953
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:05,610
They don't know all the films.
They don't know.

954
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,800
They think Sandler,
they think the other guys,

955
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,080
but they don't know that I was the 
first.

956
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,940
I was,
you know,

957
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,940
at the time because MTV was so big.
Yeah.

958
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:18,340
You were the first celebrity you and 
like Denis Leary,

959
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:23,370
like Denis leary became a big celebrity 
off mtv two and then like remote control

960
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,530
some movies.
But I was starting in a lot of movies 

961
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,620
and I always do albums.
Saw that seven.

962
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,660
I was in my twenties and I was having an
awesome time.

963
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,100
That had to be weird.
It was awesome,

964
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,640
but it's so much growing up like in the 
store,

965
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,940
like from the time you were as old as 
you could remember being a part of the 

966
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,531
comedy store and then all of a sudden 
being 20 and being famous on MTV and MTV

967
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:51,970
was gigantic and I had my own billboard.
It was sick,

968
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,820
it was a kid.
And look,

969
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:59,821
I had,
I had sold out all the shows at the 

970
00:40:59,821 --> 00:40:59,821
roxy,
you know,

971
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:01,570
I had an album and I was doing all of it
at once.

972
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,950
Was it weird?
It was so much fun.

973
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,460
It was so much fun.
That's why now when I look back on my 

974
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,460
films,
I get kind of sad.

975
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,230
Why?
Because that time of my life was my 

976
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,170
happiest time.
Why does it make you sad?

977
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:23,220
Um,
because it was really amazing and now 

978
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,451
life is still good,
but it's not like it was so well.

979
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,370
I think for a lot of people in their 
twenties,

980
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:33,890
at least my opinion when you're in your 
twenties,

981
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,110
if you fuck up,
it doesn't really matter.

982
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,380
And it's in life is like one big,
like whatever.

983
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,830
And that's kind of what I miss now,
like when you get older,

984
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:46,130
like things are like your mom sick or 
this or you know,

985
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,410
there's all these things,
life things,

986
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:51,170
you know,
or like I'm going to be 50 next year.

987
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,680
You know what I mean?
Just like things like when you're 

988
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:56,680
younger,
dude,

989
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,441
I used to have like me and my friends,
we used to go to the beach and smoke 

990
00:41:59,441 --> 00:41:59,441
pot,
you know,

991
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:01,310
we used to go to the roxy,
we used to go to the rainbow.

992
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:06,310
It was like,
it was still do that because they don't 

993
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,771
feel like it.
We're the ones that make you sad that 

994
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:09,260
you don't feel like doing those things.
What do you feel like doing?

995
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,470
Going to the Korean bath house and 
watching the news and chilling and 

996
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,470
drinking juice.
We'll just do it.

997
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,890
That's what I do.
So why is that sad?

998
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,910
That's what's confusing.
I wouldn't say it's sad.

999
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,210
I know I talk.
No,

1000
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,850
not the movies that watching the movies 
make me sad because I missed starring in

1001
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:27,830
films.
So what happened?

1002
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,420
Like,
why did that dry up?

1003
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,090
Um,
I think it's several reasons.

1004
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,420
Number one,
I was so big and I think the bigger you 

1005
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:40,760
are and the fast you make it,
the harder you fall.

1006
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,180
I think that's just like normal because 
it was like you can only,

1007
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,600
you know what I mean?
That was one thing and also I think the 

1008
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,601
whole weasel thing was like,
it was cool for awhile and then like 

1009
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:55,751
after a while it's not cool just like a 
lot of things and I also think I didn't 

1010
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:58,160
listen to my age and some managers they 
told me not to do.

1011
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,960
I'm in the army now remember I did it.
It was a good movie.

1012
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:03,530
No,
I know,

1013
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,470
but here's the story behind it.
What happened was,

1014
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:08,930
is I had a three album deal at Disney.
I hadn't seen,

1015
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:09,760
Oh man,
son in law.

1016
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,770
These big hits for me did really well 
and then it came time to do my third 

1017
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,980
movie and it was in the army now and my 
managers and the agents were like,

1018
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,050
we don't know.
You know,

1019
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:24,230
you have to cut all your hair off and 
all that shit in the scripts.

1020
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:25,370
Kind of like,
okay.

1021
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,510
And new line approached us with this 
other film called totally London,

1022
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:34,690
which is me being an AU pair in London,
which I thought was actually really 

1023
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,561
funny idea.
And Jeffrey Katzenberg who used to run 

1024
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:39,680
Disney wouldn't let me do that movie at 
New Line,

1025
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,330
you know,
being an AU pair in London.

1026
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:46,150
So he bought the script and shelved it.
So I did in the army now in the army now

1027
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:51,190
didn't do as good as the other films.
And then after that Disney didn't sign 

1028
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,020
me up to do more movies.
And then after that I did jury duty and 

1029
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,650
jury duty didn't do so good.
You know what I mean?

1030
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:02,790
So it was financially,
it was when the movies started to draw 

1031
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,830
maybe poor choices,
like not listening to my agents and 

1032
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,120
managers and stuff at the time.
But I didn't come at it like,

1033
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,190
fuck you.
I came at it like I want to work,

1034
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:11,990
I love acting,
I love going to the set.

1035
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,230
That's another thing is like,
I did an Adam Sandler film,

1036
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,990
I don't know the,
the,

1037
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,470
the uh,
the last one he did the,

1038
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:21,470
I'm Sandy Wexler and you know,
you go up on the set,

1039
00:44:21,471 --> 00:44:26,471
you know,
an Adam starring in this film and I'm 

1040
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:26,471
not,
you know what I mean?

1041
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:26,610
And I used to star in films and it's,
it's,

1042
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,010
it's a weird feeling for me.
I'm like,

1043
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,520
I'm happy to be on the set and I love 
Adam and he's an old dear friend and I'm

1044
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,820
super happy for them,
but I was starring in films,

1045
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,100
you know what I mean?
Everywhere I go,

1046
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,290
people say,
why aren't you starring in films?

1047
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:41,070
Like,
what?

1048
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,650
What's up?
And I can't answer it,

1049
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,930
you know what I mean?
Poor choices.

1050
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:48,200
The weasel shit dried up.
Um,

1051
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,550
you know,
the movies didn't perform as well.

1052
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:53,490
I didn't listen to my agents.
I wasn't like doing drugs.

1053
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,170
It wasn't like I got all fucked up.

1054
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,690
I just,
just one movie didn't do so good and the

1055
00:44:58,691 --> 00:45:02,770
next one that we didn't do so good and 
then they eventually just stopped coming

1056
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,040
because he think about it.

1057
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,840
Biodome didn't do as good as jury duty 
even know now,

1058
00:45:08,841 --> 00:45:11,180
like it's a big head,
it's a cold call from me,

1059
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,880
but at the time,
you know what I mean.

1060
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:19,050
And Yeah.
And then I got a sitcom on Fox and that 

1061
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,590
didn't go so things were like in and I 
was also turning 30 and I was,

1062
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,080
my 30th birthday was very emotional for 
me.

1063
00:45:24,081 --> 00:45:29,081
I cried a lot my 30th birthday because I
was going from like a boy to a man and I

1064
00:45:29,841 --> 00:45:32,300
didn't know how to do it,
you know what I mean?

1065
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,950
I was just like,
I didn't know,

1066
00:45:33,951 --> 00:45:38,951
like I didn't know how to.
I didn't know how to deal in my 40th 

1067
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:39,860
birthday was awesome.
It was great,

1068
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:40,550
you know,
I was happy,

1069
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,560
you know what I mean?
My 50th birthday,

1070
00:45:42,561 --> 00:45:47,561
I'll probably cry again every 20 years.
Exactly.

1071
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,510
But um,
so I missed starring in films,

1072
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:51,650
you know,
I miss it,

1073
00:45:51,651 --> 00:45:53,030
I miss it.
I love acting.

1074
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,130
That's my first love.
I think,

1075
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,830
you know,
I mean you are on fucking TV.

1076
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,410
Do you like acting?
Really know.

1077
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,740
Yeah,
I mean it's okay.

1078
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:04,170
Can,
you were great on that show.

1079
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,300
Yeah,
well I love that show.

1080
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,390
I love working with those people,
but I've done some other acting.

1081
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,140
I was like,
Eh,

1082
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,380
it's okay.
It's not my thing like standup comedy to

1083
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:15,420
me is more fun.
And then hosting you love hosting.

1084
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,270
I don't.
I mean I like doing the UFC,

1085
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:23,330
like working for the UFC and doing 
standup comedy and doing a commentary 

1086
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,360
for the UFC.
Those things are fun.

1087
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,820
Doing this is fun,
but I'm acting.

1088
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:31,821
To me it was like long hours waiting 
around and then also a lot of actors are

1089
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:37,380
cool but there's like 10 percent or just
fake.

1090
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,520
They're just weird associate paths they 
care about themselves,

1091
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:44,340
their complete narcissists.
They don't have,

1092
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,290
I just can't,
I can't connect with them,

1093
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,700
you know?
So there was a lot of that because I 

1094
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:51,700
think you're a good actor and I think 
that

1095
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,240
if he maybe developed a show or a film,
you know,

1096
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,550
for you,
you know,

1097
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:54,800
I think.

1098
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:57,560
Awesome.
That sounds like torture really.

1099
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:00,700
Yeah.
You're saying that I'm like really stuck

1100
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:01,510
on a set.
Yeah.

1101
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:06,540
So you know,
you just don't enjoy it and you just 

1102
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,441
don't enjoy acting.
One of the things that was appealing 

1103
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:08,810
about fear factor was no actors and so 
it was like,

1104
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,860
oh,
I don't have to act,

1105
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,570
but it could still be on TV.
It makes them money.

1106
00:47:11,571 --> 00:47:12,560
Okay,
let's do it.

1107
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:17,820
Know,
and I felt like it was going to get 

1108
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:17,820
canceled.
I was like,

1109
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,711
this is just to be some horrible 
disaster and then I'll go have some 

1110
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:24,461
jokes about it and I'm like,
I'll definitely get like at least 10 

1111
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:24,461
minutes of material at this fucking 
show.

1112
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:29,620
Huge hit,
and I ended up doing a hundred and 54 or

1113
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:30,250
something.

1114
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,610
You can get,
like,

1115
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,690
what is it something you don't get the 
same residuals that you would get for a 

1116
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,870
sitcom though,
but is it called,

1117
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,720
what's it called when there's over 100 
episodes?

1118
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,190
Syndication,
syndication,

1119
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,350
syndication,
syndication,

1120
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:45,700
money,
syndication.

1121
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:49,060
Money's not what everybody thinks it is.
Syndication might like news radio,

1122
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:52,180
one syndication.
So I got syndication money from that,

1123
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:54,930
but it's not like Jerry Seinfeld 
syndication money.

1124
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:58,300
See he owns a piece of the show.
Then you get the real money,

1125
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,250
but you get me.
You can't complain.

1126
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,220
It's a lot of money.
My friend Peter Lang cough,

1127
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,160
he owns Hawaii if I have.
Oh well.

1128
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,810
Which is on CBS original one,
but he went over.

1129
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:13,280
He went over 100 episodes.
That's the big payday.

1130
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,880
He's fucking,
he's got like a fucking $7,000,000

1131
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:20,881
house in Malibu and he is having a big 
old party.

1132
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,330
I would imagine as soon as it goes over 
100.

1133
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:26,800
You just go.
Yes.

1134
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,280
Oh my God.
Right?

1135
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,380
Yeah,
yeah.

1136
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:30,600
Well,
you know Kevin James,

1137
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,860
a buddy of mine,
he came to Queens,

1138
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:34,720
went over 100.
Oh Wow.

1139
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,210
I want it goes over 100.
You long as you don't fuck up.

1140
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:39,610
You're pretty much set long.
You don't go crazy.

1141
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,260
You don't start doing math and find 
yacht.

1142
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:50,530
Yeah.
So maybe stuff like this will bring you 

1143
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:50,530
back to films,
you know,

1144
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,400
I miss it,
you know what I mean?

1145
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:52,280
Is it,
you know,

1146
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,550
and that side that I was happy that the 
Steven Miller thing,

1147
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,320
you know,
worked out for me.

1148
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,520
You know,
I wonder how,

1149
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,320
what would be the strategy to get back 
to it?

1150
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:02,770
I guess to kick ass at a comedy special,
be a good way to do it,

1151
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:07,830
to put together a really good comedy,
special loco if you thought about doing 

1152
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:08,710
that.
Yeah.

1153
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:13,770
You know what I mean?
They have Robbie at Netflix has to hit 

1154
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:13,770
me up,
you know,

1155
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:13,790
he's like the guy.
Yeah.

1156
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,520
So I mean,
you know,

1157
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,230
we're still doing a lot of standup.
Yeah,

1158
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:20,560
I still do a lot of standup or it's 
talking about editing earlier.

1159
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:23,860
So another thing that I'm editing,
I'm editing that documentary series,

1160
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,560
which I'm happy about it,
but I'm also editing a documentary in my

1161
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:28,630
life and I've been doing that for three 
years.

1162
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:30,130
Really?
It's fucking sick.

1163
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,050
60 seventies,
eighties,

1164
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:34,690
nineties.
And I've got over 50 interviews.

1165
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:37,330
I got like Jeffrey Katzenberg and oh 
wow.

1166
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,720
Rotenberg and Doug Herzogg and Chris 
Rock.

1167
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,190
Mark Marin.
I mean everyone.

1168
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,010
Sagat.
Everyone has done it from too,

1169
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:48,370
you know,
comics from the seventies.

1170
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:51,100
Lenny shoultz did it.
Crazy lending,

1171
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:56,130
crazy learning.
So I saw Lenny Shoultz in Montreal in 

1172
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,900
1992.
Like way back in the day.

1173
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:02,110
I saw him at the comedy works,
the Montreal Comedy Festival.

1174
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,250
Yeah,
he's hilarious.

1175
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,080
Yeah,
he was great.

1176
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:08,040
He was the original gallagher and a lot 
of ways he was,

1177
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,670
it was one of the original guys.

1178
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,950
He's still around.
Yeah,

1179
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,100
lives in Florida.
What does he do these days?

1180
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,700
I think he's just retired,
so doesn't have to work the main room he

1181
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:22,870
was as a comic growing up.
He was billy braver when we got,

1182
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,430
um,
uh,

1183
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,190
as a comic or that he is the one right 
above billy.

1184
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,010
Click on the

1185
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,520
one Arrow right there.
That's one.

1186
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:30,620
Yeah.
So He's,

1187
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,160
you know,
his,

1188
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,180
his joke,
right?

1189
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:34,070
Which one where he used to do the,
um,

1190
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,280
he used to do the lenny shoultz diet.
No,

1191
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:42,310
do you know about that?
Where he would take all his clothes off 

1192
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:42,310
and he,
he would do this in the main room.

1193
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,840
He would take,
he would take all his clothes off and he

1194
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:45,610
would,
um,

1195
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:50,830
stripped down to a Speedo,
right to a speedo and he would say a 

1196
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:55,301
lot.
There's a lot of diets out there and 

1197
00:50:55,301 --> 00:50:55,301
people don't eat the food they're 
supposed to eat or Dah,

1198
00:50:55,301 --> 00:50:55,301
Dah,
Dah.

1199
00:50:55,301 --> 00:50:59,830
He goes on the Lenny Shoultz Diet.
I put the food on my body of the places 

1200
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:00,530
that I want to lose weight.
Right.

1201
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,520
So He'd have these fucking pigs in these
ducks behind him and he played the music

1202
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:09,670
and he would have all this food over 
there and you have spaghetti and you 

1203
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,700
know,
and it was just like turned into this 

1204
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,630
fucking crazy thing and you poor 
fucking.

1205
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:19,900
He had poor a cottage cheese in his 
balls and then he'd have like great 

1206
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,030
fruits.
He goes,

1207
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:21,800
if you want to lose some weight in your 
elbow,

1208
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:27,020
that motherfucking quite fruits and the 
throw the grapefruits you people have 

1209
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:27,360
like,
you're not getting.

1210
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,540
You have to utilize to see how manic and
like psycho he was on stage.

1211
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:34,260
He got into it,
you know,

1212
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:34,710
I mean,
I'm in,

1213
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,430
I would hate to be that type of comment,
especially traveling,

1214
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:42,870
you know,
that's the carrot top is stoked because 

1215
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:42,870
he's just stuck in Vegas.
I mean,

1216
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,260
imagine if you had to bring a case of 
stuff around,

1217
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:45,830
uh,
you know,

1218
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:50,990
we were,
I was just talking to somebody about 

1219
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:50,990
that recently.
Those guys don't exist anymore.

1220
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,850
Like he used to be a genre,
used to be prompt comics,

1221
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,490
but like character there is.
There's letting you guys know.

1222
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,540
Yeah,
he was,

1223
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,480
he was my favorite comic growing up as a
kid.

1224
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,020
Well,
he was.

1225
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,100
Yeah,
huge and long island.

1226
00:52:05,101 --> 00:52:08,310
All the guys from Long Island loved him.
Yeah.

1227
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,520
They loved him.
Yeah.

1228
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,130
He was like,
when I first moved there,

1229
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:12,390
I was like,
who's Lenny Shoultz now?

1230
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:13,860
Like you've never seen crazy.
Lenny.

1231
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,020
Like he would hold up a bear,
you know,

1232
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:19,500
that uh,
only you the fucking smokey the bear.

1233
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,070
And he would,
he would hold it up and go,

1234
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:27,290
only you can prevent forest fires.
Go fuck you punch.

1235
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,680
It.
Didn't make any sense,

1236
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,050
but you would laugh your ass off.
He'd be like,

1237
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,700
why am I laughing at this?
I'm not sure why,

1238
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,260
but he was so funny.

1239
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:42,410
There's a,
there's a lot of comics out there that 

1240
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:42,410
have it,
that never made it,

1241
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:42,690
that are really funny.
And she ever.

1242
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,730
I'm sure you heard of Ali Jo Prater.
Yeah,

1243
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:49,731
sure.
Oh no one knows who he is the best to 

1244
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:49,731
me.
He had the best,

1245
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:51,030
strongest,
45 minutes I've ever seen.

1246
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,890
Wow.
But he never changed it.

1247
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,490
Oh,
you know what I mean?

1248
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,880
That happened with a lot of those guys 
that never really got mainstream 

1249
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,100
exposure.
Like know.

1250
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:05,180
Like I remember I went to see Kennison 
after his hbo special and he hadn't 

1251
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,500
quite figured out that you had to have 
all new material because the HBO special

1252
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:14,980
had come out and people were yelling out
bits like while he was doing the bits,

1253
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,150
you know,
and it's like,

1254
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:20,560
it was that transitionary period because
when the guys would do hbo specials,

1255
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:26,550
there was nothing like that before.
Then where someone had did in the hour 

1256
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,760
on,
you usually would do it tonight show 

1257
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:29,760
you'd be like seven minutes and then you
would go perform.

1258
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,080
People actually probably wanted to hear 
those seven minutes again.

1259
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,660
You know,
who is the most,

1260
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:38,170
to me,
the most prolific comic that always 

1261
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:38,170
changed it up with George Carlin.
Sure.

1262
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:39,580
Every year on a new hour.
Every year.

1263
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,840
Every year he,
I think at 14,

1264
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:43,430
right?
14 hbo specials.

1265
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,980
That's fucking insane.

1266
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,910
Saying,
you know,

1267
00:53:46,911 --> 00:53:48,260
who else did it?
Richard.

1268
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:49,220
Jeni,
Richard,

1269
00:53:49,221 --> 00:53:54,221
Jenny worked at East side comedy club in
Long Island and he did a different show 

1270
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,360
Friday,
8:00

1271
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:58,250
show different show Friday,
10:00

1272
00:53:58,251 --> 00:54:00,350
show different show.
Saturday 8:00

1273
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:02,720
show and a different show.
Saturday 10:00

1274
00:54:02,721 --> 00:54:07,721
show.
All the conflicts were sitting around 

1275
00:54:07,721 --> 00:54:07,721
scratching their head.
I remember I was backstage with.

1276
00:54:07,721 --> 00:54:08,780
Okay.
I was an opener back then.

1277
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:13,890
I was just starting out,
but I was backstage with all these guys 

1278
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:13,890
who were like local headliners and they 
were just like,

1279
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:14,690
fuck,
we're terrible.

1280
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:19,790
It will.
It was just confronted by how good he 

1281
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:19,790
was.
Yeah,

1282
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:23,170
he was a fucking G.
I still to this day think that he's one 

1283
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:23,430
of the most underrated comedians

1284
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,220
ever.
Ever.

1285
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:30,730
Did you ever thing that?
I noticed because we had the same 

1286
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:30,730
manager.
Michael Rosenberg was,

1287
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:33,080
was my manager and Jenny's manager at 
the time.

1288
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,400
The one thing that I noticed about him 
though,

1289
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:38,900
if I don't know if you experienced this 
with him,

1290
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:42,710
is that his standup in the clubs was 
fucking insane,

1291
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,350
but for some reason when he was on tv 
doing it,

1292
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,320
it didn't translate as much for some 
reason.

1293
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,310
I think the,
uh,

1294
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:51,080
you know how sometimes the camera just 
doesn't,

1295
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:56,650
doesn't fit for you.
It doesn't pick up you as funny as you 

1296
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,671
are.
That was kind of my experience with him 

1297
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:00,860
because he was,
you know,

1298
00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:05,861
he killed himself and I don't know if 
that was part of the reason because he 

1299
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:06,830
was frustrated,
you know what I mean?

1300
00:55:06,831 --> 00:55:11,831
A lot of people,
I guess they kill themselves if things 

1301
00:55:11,831 --> 00:55:11,831
don't work out for them.
Right?

1302
00:55:11,831 --> 00:55:13,670
Yeah.
I mean like in their career,

1303
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,900
I guess.
I don't know.

1304
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,430
Well,
he,

1305
00:55:16,431 --> 00:55:16,780
um,

1306
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,910
he always wanted to be Jim Carrey.
That was his thing,

1307
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,680
you know,
he wanted to be Jim Carrey.

1308
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,790
He wanted to be the comic that 
transitioned from doing standup to these

1309
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:29,850
doing these gigantic movies and he had a
show for awhile and you planted the 

1310
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:33,850
platypus.
And he did actually did the mask with 

1311
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:34,820
Jim Carrey in that movie.
It was great.

1312
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,220
Yeah.
It just didn't get a lot of roles,

1313
00:55:37,221 --> 00:55:42,221
didn't get a lot of parts,
but I still maintained that a steaming 

1314
00:55:42,221 --> 00:55:45,491
pile of me.
If you're listening to this and you 

1315
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:45,491
think in like when we watch them,
that you can get it on itunes.

1316
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,860
A steaming pile of me is one of my all 
time favorite standup specials.

1317
00:55:48,861 --> 00:55:53,861
It's fucking great.
It's a lot of it's relevant today 

1318
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:57,700
because it's 2007,
but he does this thing about the 

1319
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,131
difference between people on the left 
and people on the right and people in 

1320
00:56:00,131 --> 00:56:00,380
the middle and it's fucking brilliant.

1321
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:03,710
It's brilliant.
I got to hear that and he was like a guy

1322
00:56:03,711 --> 00:56:06,950
that I saw when I was starting out where
I really realized,

1323
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:11,951
uh,
watching him how important it is to 

1324
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:15,110
really go in depth on a subject because 
he didn't just scratch the surface.

1325
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,740
Like when I was an open mic.
Are you.

1326
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,250
One of the things you see about open 
micros is they'll,

1327
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,250
they'll touch a subject and then they 
move onto the next subject.

1328
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,340
But they basically scratched the surface
of it.

1329
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:30,450
Jenny would dig a trench.
He would go deep and he would like get 

1330
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,830
everything there was to get out of that 
bin.

1331
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,870
And then he would move on to another 
subject.

1332
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:39,871
And by the time he did,
you were fucking howling and laughter 

1333
00:56:39,871 --> 00:56:40,480
and holding your sides.
And he was,

1334
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,560
it was amazing.
Yeah,

1335
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:42,490
he was,
he was,

1336
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:43,750
he was so good.

1337
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,920
He was.
Yeah.

1338
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,230
He and I agree with you though,
when you see them in the clubs,

1339
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:48,910
you really got to see what it's really 
all about.

1340
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,130
That's really the problem with like 
specials,

1341
00:56:51,131 --> 00:56:56,131
right?
It's like trying to figure out how to 

1342
00:56:56,131 --> 00:56:58,210
translate what you do when it's a Friday
night and the o are,

1343
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:03,450
how do you get someone to experience 
that magic of like a perfect club set 

1344
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,430
and you know,
a special.

1345
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:11,550
I think it's people's faces.
I think it's comedians faces some just 

1346
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,930
pop off of screen and some don't.
That's my opinion.

1347
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,340
There's a little bit of that because 
Richard had a weird face and he did it.

1348
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,870
He had plastic surgery and there's a 
bunch of shit going on.

1349
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,140
Yeah.
I don't know.

1350
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:27,630
I'd like clubs too in terms of like 
filming because I felt that connection 

1351
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:34,330
because when you do your stuff,
you're here in the audience is back 

1352
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:34,330
there.

1353
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:34,330
It's a little disconnect if you're in a 
big theater.

1354
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,460
Yeah,
there's good things about a big theater.

1355
00:57:36,461 --> 00:57:39,910
It's like you hear a huge roar,
you get to see the place and everybody's

1356
00:57:39,911 --> 00:57:40,540
like,
wow,

1357
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:45,750
pauly shore must be gigantic.
Look at all these fucking people in the 

1358
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,631
audience,
but when you're at home you're on a 

1359
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,471
couch or in front of the TV.
It's very intimate so you don't feel 

1360
00:57:52,471 --> 00:57:55,921
connected to this big giant place.
So that's why my comedy central special 

1361
00:57:55,921 --> 00:58:00,481
from 2014,
Rocky Mountain High I did in Denver at 

1362
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:01,690
the comedy works and the reason why I 
did it there,

1363
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:04,030
I was like,
this is an intimate room.

1364
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:09,031
I want to have an intimate show and if 
I'm here like this is the place to do 

1365
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:09,031
it.
It's like it's nice,

1366
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,510
tight.
Let me ask you something.

1367
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:14,620
At what point as a stand up did you feel
that you got really funny?

1368
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,570
Like you,
like you felt like,

1369
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:17,290
oh shit.
Like I,

1370
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,810
I feel like I'm really funny.
Like you know,

1371
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:23,080
I'd say at the beginning it was more 
than 10 years.

1372
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:25,630
In probably 10 years in I felt like I 
was competent.

1373
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,150
That would feel like I'm better now than
I've ever been before,

1374
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,210
but it's just work.
It's just constantly working at it.

1375
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:35,560
Like I feel like standup is one of the 
unique things that require.

1376
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:40,980
It requires like rigorous attention and 
detail and you have to be paying and you

1377
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:45,880
have to be enthusiastic and you have to 
be disciplined.

1378
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:51,260
Like,
and it's almost contrary to what a lot 

1379
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,791
of us are,
like a lot of us aren't disciplined 

1380
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:56,071
people,
which is why we're funding in the first 

1381
00:58:56,071 --> 00:58:56,071
place because we were silly and then 
we're impulsive.

1382
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,810
We laugh about things,
joke around about things and think about

1383
00:58:58,811 --> 00:59:01,570
things in a fucked up way that's outside
the box of normal thinking,

1384
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:06,810
you know.
So I think that's a lot of times that 

1385
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:10,111
sort of mindset is contrary to the 
mindset that's required to be 

1386
00:59:10,111 --> 00:59:10,920
disciplined to right.
But,

1387
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,360
but as a kid,
as a kid growing up,

1388
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:14,530
tell me about yours now.
Funny.

1389
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:15,730
Yeah,
that's what I was going to say.

1390
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:18,010
So do you have brothers and sisters?
Sister,

1391
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:20,860
and how old is she compared to you?
She's a year younger.

1392
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,220
And then your parents,

1393
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,950
you grew up in the house altogether?
Yeah.

1394
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,760
Like not divorced.
No.

1395
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:27,650
No,
we were divorced.

1396
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,080
My mom got divorced when I was like 
five.

1397
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,880
Okay.
So that was like me.

1398
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:33,000
Right.
That's good.

1399
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:35,030
Did you have,
did she have a lot of boyfriends?

1400
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:36,050
No.
No.

1401
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,300
She hooked up with my Stepdad and 
they've been together ever since.

1402
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,730
My mom had a lot of boyfriends.
Yeah,

1403
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:41,450
that's different.
Yeah.

1404
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,110
Yeah.
But,

1405
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:44,770
but anyways,
you would walk in a room,

1406
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,840
a Joe,
Joe Rogan would walk into a room and 

1407
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,270
you'd say something where they laugh.
Nobody thought it was funny,

1408
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,670
but oh,
so no one's a funny person.

1409
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,780
Say you weren't funny.
Right.

1410
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:59,090
You know how I got into college and 
making people laugh when we were doing 

1411
00:59:59,090 --> 00:59:59,090
martial arts,
um,

1412
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:03,910
because we're going to fight and 
tournament's so we'd all be nervous and 

1413
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:05,840
it was like I would be the one that made
everybody laugh,

1414
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:08,150
like when we be on a bus to go to a 
tournament.

1415
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:10,250
That's like,
for real.

1416
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,290
You talk about this?
Not really.

1417
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,170
I mean,
maybe I've brought it up before,

1418
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,830
but it's funny.
It's funny,

1419
01:00:15,831 --> 01:00:20,831
but it's funny,
just the scene of you on a bus with a 

1420
01:00:20,831 --> 01:00:21,890
bunch of kids fucking shooting the shit.
Well,

1421
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:26,891
one of them to this day,
I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to 

1422
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,640
my friend Steve Graham and my other 
friend Ed shorter.

1423
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:29,140
They're,
they're the,

1424
01:00:29,141 --> 01:00:31,490
they're the guys who talked me into it.
If it wasn't for them.

1425
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,730
And Steve Graham is still a dear friend 
to this day.

1426
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:36,440
So you were on the bus,
you're going to your,

1427
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:39,800
you're wrestling tournaments in Boston?
It was kickboxing or talking window back

1428
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:40,370
then,
but yeah,

1429
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:43,010
it would be.
But you grew up right in Boston.

1430
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,360
I grew up in Newton,
Newton,

1431
01:00:44,361 --> 01:00:46,220
upper falls,
which is like a suburb of Boston.

1432
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,050
Is that like by Springfield,
mass?

1433
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,880
No,
Newton is like,

1434
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:53,000
um,
it's right off of route nine,

1435
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:56,960
so it's like a natick need in that area.

1436
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,820
So it's pretty close to Boston,
you know,

1437
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,620
it's like not a,
not a far drive at all.

1438
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:05,621
And I would drive into town to train my 
taekwondo schools in Boston and um,

1439
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:10,310
we would travel around the country,
we'd fly to places compete,

1440
01:01:10,311 --> 01:01:11,930
you know,
it was like a giant part of my life,

1441
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:14,910
like karate chop shit,
like fucking no tournaments.

1442
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,570
So we were always nervous because,
you know,

1443
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,450
guys get knocked out,
guys get kicked in.

1444
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:21,620
The face is terrible.
Salary.

1445
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:23,540
You.
I started when I was 15.

1446
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,220
That's when I started this as in high 
school.

1447
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,870
Yeah.
So yeah.

1448
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:28,700
So you're driving to the things.
Yeah.

1449
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:33,701
So by the time I was 21,
like I was like very successful at it.

1450
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:37,850
I was a four time state champion and I 
was competing constantly.

1451
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:40,130
I won the US Open.
I won a bunch of these,

1452
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,810
like big tournaments,
like the bay state games.

1453
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:44,760
Did you ever go against black guys?
Yeah,

1454
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,670
stuff I did.
I was nervous.

1455
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:48,050
I know,
that's what I'm saying.

1456
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:51,530
Fuck right.
Did you be the first black I fought.

1457
01:01:51,531 --> 01:01:56,531
I knocked out for that.
That was a huge alleviation of my 

1458
01:01:56,531 --> 01:01:59,561
worries.
I assume right after I won the UFC stuff

1459
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,130
and I watch you out there to like when 
you first were doing it,

1460
01:02:04,131 --> 01:02:06,380
there was no black guys,
you know what I mean?

1461
01:02:06,381 --> 01:02:08,150
I'm thinking I'm just a guy watching it 
and I'm like,

1462
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:11,540
where's the fucking black guys?
Because they would kill everyone and now

1463
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,550
the son is black guys and they're like,
oh shit.

1464
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:18,580
You know what I mean?
But what's interesting in boxing that 

1465
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:18,580
was always the case,
right?

1466
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,470
But now you're seeing Russians like 
Gennady Golovkin,

1467
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:20,040
you know,
and

1468
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,040
like it's,
I mean it's really just a matter of the 

1469
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,941
economic situation because in the early 
days of the 19 hundreds,

1470
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:34,580
it was a lot of Jews because a slapsie 
Maxie Rosenbaum and there was a bunch of

1471
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:40,310
Jewish fighters because you know,
there were Jewish immigrants and they 

1472
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:41,460
faced a lot of hostility and poverty and
this was a way out.

1473
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:44,640
And then it became Italians like rocky 
Marciano,

1474
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:49,641
rocky Graziano.
There was a lot of Italian boxers and 

1475
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:52,200
then it became like Puerto Ricans and 
blacks and it's mostly,

1476
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,200
it's a lot of it is disenfranchised 
people that are looking for some sort of

1477
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:01,430
an escape from the south.
So financial keynotes like Kevin Durant 

1478
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,940
in a way.
I mean playing coop and like,

1479
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:04,520
you know.
Right.

1480
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,910
Yeah.
I mean that's their way out.

1481
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,680
It's their ticket out of poverty,
you know?

1482
01:03:07,681 --> 01:03:10,170
So with Russians now a lot,
you know,

1483
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,090
so you're on the bus,
you're with your friends,

1484
01:03:12,091 --> 01:03:17,091
you're joking around and expressions of 
people do impressions of our friends 

1485
01:03:17,091 --> 01:03:17,270
having sex,
you know,

1486
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,540
that's different things.

1487
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:23,690
So then said,
then one day they said you go to 

1488
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:23,690
connect,
go to comedy connection in Boston.

1489
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,870
My friend Steve said,
you know,

1490
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:27,300
you're funny,
you're really funny.

1491
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,740
And I was like,
look,

1492
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,750
I make you laugh because you're my 
friend.

1493
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:35,900
I'm like,
other people are gonna think I'm an 

1494
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:35,900
asshole.
Because especially in Boston,

1495
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,610
which was like really conservative place
and my sense of humor was very fucked up

1496
01:03:38,611 --> 01:03:41,910
because these people or a fighters,
you know,

1497
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:46,911
so there was all these black belts who 
are competing on a national level 

1498
01:03:46,911 --> 01:03:50,181
traveling all around the country.
Like they were very intense people so 

1499
01:03:50,181 --> 01:03:50,910
you could say fucked up things to them 
to make them laugh.

1500
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,120
Like they,
their,

1501
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,400
their,
their borders there,

1502
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:59,401
their boundaries were very different 
than the average person because they 

1503
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:02,121
were experiencing such like,
I assumed cops would be a lot like that 

1504
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:02,121
too.
And maybe even soldiers,

1505
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:05,070
cops I talked to like a lot of cops that
I would train with two,

1506
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:07,470
they had the most fucked up sense of 
humor.

1507
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:12,470
Hilarious.
They would be seeing gunshot wounds all 

1508
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,470
the time and you know,
and there was,

1509
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:17,550
you know,
a lot of jokes they would tell like as 

1510
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:17,550
the guy was dead,
you know,

1511
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,680
they would be over the guy's body making
jokes when no one was around.

1512
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,140
And you know,
people would think it's disrespectful,

1513
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:27,141
but a lot of it is the human brain is 
not supposed to experience that kind of 

1514
01:04:27,141 --> 01:04:31,491
stress that a cop or soldier experiences
and gallows humor as it were,

1515
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:36,690
you know,
that's what a lot of them turn to for 

1516
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:39,681
some sort of a relief.
So what I did is I went to an open mic 

1517
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:42,510
night and I watched and one,
this is actually a Richard Jeni quote,

1518
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,800
it's a great quote.
And he's right.

1519
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,670
He said one of the great things about 
terrible comedians is they inspire other

1520
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:50,310
people to try it because you watch them,
they go,

1521
01:04:50,311 --> 01:04:51,590
well,
this guy is fucking terrible.

1522
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,430
We'll lose it.
At least if I suck,

1523
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:58,580
I won't suck that bad.
So my idea of standup is I would go to 

1524
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,750
someplace and I would see like Robin 
Williams and Richard Pryor and all these

1525
01:05:00,751 --> 01:05:03,150
people that were just like gods.
And I'd be like,

1526
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,750
there's no way I'm going to be able to 
go up there and do that.

1527
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,800
But when I went to an open mic night,
I realize like,

1528
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:08,630
oh no,
these people,

1529
01:05:08,631 --> 01:05:10,980
it's just like being a white belt in 
martial arts,

1530
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:16,220
like they're starting from the beginning
and so that's why in this setup for 

1531
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,030
which club was ditches?
Stitches in Boston and

1532
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:18,700
the eighties,
right?

1533
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,070
Eighty eight.
August 27th,

1534
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:22,630
1988.
That's funny.

1535
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:26,170
I started.
My first one was September 25th.

1536
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:30,130
Nineteen 85.
That was my first time.

1537
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:33,460
And the crazy,
just think back all the time.

1538
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:36,940
Just keeps moving on poly.
It's not cool.

1539
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,870
It's definitely weird.
Yeah.

1540
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,880
Yeah.
It never ends.

1541
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:46,390
It's not going to keep going when you 
have a family now.

1542
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,920
Yeah.
How many kids?

1543
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,510
Three.
Wow.

1544
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:50,770
I know.
It's nuts.

1545
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:54,520
How come here you'd have no desire?
None whatsoever.

1546
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,530
Um,
yes,

1547
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:57,730
yes,
yes.

1548
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,950
But you got to find the right Gal or 
guy.

1549
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:01,790
Guy.
You never know.

1550
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,970
Right to that.
In this day and age,

1551
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:09,290
you saw an article the other day.
It said a transgender man gave birth to 

1552
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:10,420
baby.
And then.

1553
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:13,960
And then Ben Shapiro retweet it.
Woman gave birth,

1554
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,450
right?
Yeah.

1555
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:21,670
Just I'm feeling it more now that I'm 
getting older because at the bottom line

1556
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:23,420
is,
you know,

1557
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:24,040
I don't want to.

1558
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,630
Well,
you know,

1559
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,370
Larry King,
Michael Douglas,

1560
01:06:27,371 --> 01:06:29,230
Laderman,
these guys have their kids were in their

1561
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:31,350
late sixties way lake.
Well,

1562
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,650
yeah.
You know what I mean?

1563
01:06:32,651 --> 01:06:37,651
So if you get in like right now,
anyone listening just tweaked their 

1564
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,720
tweet,
their photos at Joe Rogan and 

1565
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:45,720
researches,
it's time to start freezing.

1566
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,710
Exactly right.
I should get Whitney cummings pregnant.

1567
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:52,711
What do you think about that?
I'm just talk to her and see if that's 

1568
01:06:52,711 --> 01:06:54,610
something she'd be interested in.
I would imagine she would not be and she

1569
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:55,820
wouldn't.
Yeah,

1570
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,720
I wouldn't want my semen.
I,

1571
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:02,940
you'd have to talk to her to be clear.
I wouldn't want to decide for her or it 

1572
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,770
could be Eliza.
I think she's getting married yet,

1573
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,790
but before.
Ooh,

1574
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,400
I dunno.
Why would you want to get the.

1575
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,510
But why would you want to get married 
now?

1576
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,510
Yeah.
I don't know man.

1577
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:18,490
It's like there's pros and cons,
you know,

1578
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:23,491
like a [inaudible],
one of my best friends and he travels 

1579
01:07:23,491 --> 01:07:25,510
the world and he experiences a life 
that's very.

1580
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,950
I mean he didn't know what already just 
did.

1581
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:30,820
We took three months off actually four 
months and just vanished.

1582
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,460
Didn't talk to anybody.
Didn't bring a laptop.

1583
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:38,490
Yeah,
he did the Chappelle thing more than 

1584
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:40,471
that.
He went to Vietnam and Cambodia and 

1585
01:07:40,471 --> 01:07:41,410
Cambodia,
Thailand.

1586
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:45,670
We went all over the place,
but he did it by himself with no one and

1587
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:49,210
just met people experience things and 
just no one knew who he was.

1588
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,360
No,
me and a few people recognized him and 

1589
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,001
he took pictures with them and put them 
on facebook and that's how we found out 

1590
01:07:56,001 --> 01:07:56,001
he was still alive,
but it was weird,

1591
01:07:56,001 --> 01:07:57,250
but he just decided like,
Hey,

1592
01:07:57,251 --> 01:07:59,290
I'm just willing to just have an 
adventure.

1593
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:02,530
That's something obviously is out of the
question when you have children,

1594
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:04,300
you can't do that.
So there's,

1595
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,950
there's,
there's pros.

1596
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,360
Not,
I wouldn't want to.

1597
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:12,390
That's not me.
I wouldn't want to disappear for four 

1598
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:12,390
months.
No kids or kids.

1599
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:14,680
It's just like I don't have that desire,
but for him,

1600
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:16,520
you know,
the desire to do an adventure,

1601
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,070
to go someplace for a couple of weeks is
cool,

1602
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,860
but when you have kids,
especially if you have little girls that

1603
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:23,430
wait for you and then they,
you know,

1604
01:08:23,431 --> 01:08:25,610
you talked to them on the phone and 
can't wait to see you.

1605
01:08:25,611 --> 01:08:27,080
It's,
it's a different world,

1606
01:08:27,081 --> 01:08:28,940
you know.
How are you now?

1607
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:34,000
I'm almost 50 50 tomorrow.
Oh my God.

1608
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,530
Happy Birthday.
Thank you.

1609
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,220
That's amazing.
Thank you very much.

1610
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:43,190
Are You doing a big 50th birthday?
Parties are bullshit,

1611
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:48,700
but it's like me.
I went to a friend of mine's birthday 

1612
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:48,700
party.
It was his 50th birthday party.

1613
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,590
It was so annoying.
They played a video.

1614
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,630
We had a watch,
a video and it was like 20 minutes and I

1615
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,740
was like,
Jesus Christ.

1616
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:55,370
When is it?
Over?

1617
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,350
And then when it was over,
oh,

1618
01:08:57,351 --> 01:09:02,351
his fucking family members and his 
friends got up and told stories with a 

1619
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:06,671
microphone and they held.
Everybody kept up with their shitty 

1620
01:09:06,671 --> 01:09:06,671
stories.
It was death,

1621
01:09:06,671 --> 01:09:07,760
it was death.
I couldn't wait to get out of there,

1622
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:12,800
you know?
It was funny as and play this video I 

1623
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:12,800
have here,

1624
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,260
you know,
it was weird,

1625
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:18,280
you know.
Did you ever like sometimes like dream 

1626
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:18,570
about things like when you think things 
like you have dreams.

1627
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:23,910
Yeah,
I knew I was coming in here today and I 

1628
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:23,910
had a dream about you.
Yeah.

1629
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,460
And it was interesting.
I had a dream that we,

1630
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:31,461
you know,
we were doing our thing and it was cool 

1631
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:31,461
and I said congratulations on your new 
show.

1632
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:33,090
Your show has been on the air and it was
like,

1633
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,750
it was called the Rogan's and it was you
and a camper with your,

1634
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,210
your wife and your kids going across 
America.

1635
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:40,930
It was like a family,
like almost like,

1636
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:46,190
you know,
almost like the griswolds but the 

1637
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:46,370
Rogan's like,
like,

1638
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,600
but I know that that's something you 
would never do.

1639
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,190
But it was funny.
It was hilarious.

1640
01:09:50,191 --> 01:09:54,720
It was like on the travel channel and it
was like you guys fishing and eating and

1641
01:09:54,721 --> 01:09:55,990
just how hilarious.

1642
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,470
It would be.
Kind of hilarious.

1643
01:09:58,471 --> 01:10:00,970
But it's kind of gross to because like 
whenever I see people that are,

1644
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:05,980
have their kids on these reality shows 
like you're not even letting that kid 

1645
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:05,980
choose,
right?

1646
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,360
You don't even give that kid a choice to
be famous like honey booboo or,

1647
01:10:09,361 --> 01:10:14,361
and those fucking people you,
you're just putting your kid on tv 

1648
01:10:14,361 --> 01:10:15,630
before your kid even understands the 
consequences of it.

1649
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,340
I mean at least when you got on 
television,

1650
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:20,670
you were in your twenties,
like you kind of were an adult.

1651
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:25,671
You kinda got it.
I mean it was young and I'm sure it was 

1652
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:27,600
weird to grow up in the spotlight like 
that.

1653
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,960
But at least you were a grown up.
When you see people that have their 

1654
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,390
babies on TV and children on TV,
like what the fuck are you doing?

1655
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:41,660
Do you not know as a person's on tv that
this could be like devastating?

1656
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:48,660
Just if they read the comments is if 
they went to instagram or youtube and 

1657
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,060
read the comments like Jesus Christ,
you know,

1658
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:55,290
yeah,
we'll look at child actors do all this.

1659
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,860
Do you know what I did recently is a 
comicon.

1660
01:10:58,861 --> 01:11:02,100
You know what that is,
but you know that like you sign things.

1661
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:08,020
It's hilarious.
It was just sat down one of those 

1662
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:08,020
booths.
Yeah.

1663
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:09,120
It was like I'd never done it in a 
friend of mine.

1664
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:13,380
My friend of mine in San Antonio hooked 
me up with this agent and just,

1665
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:14,040
you know,
they give,

1666
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:14,820
you know,
they,

1667
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:20,060
they pay you obviously any fly in and,
and there's basically comicons as you 

1668
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,340
know,
it's all like,

1669
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:25,341
you know,
people are dressed as superman and 

1670
01:11:25,341 --> 01:11:27,591
Batman and all these,
but then there's the section with 

1671
01:11:27,591 --> 01:11:27,720
celebrities.
So there's a lot of like,

1672
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:32,900
people from breaking bad.
There was a lot of people from walking 

1673
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,901
dead.
But then there was like Rob Schneider 

1674
01:11:35,901 --> 01:11:35,901
was in a booth,
you know what I mean?

1675
01:11:35,901 --> 01:11:38,700
Val kilmer was in a booth and he's got 
like throat cancer.

1676
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,710
Val kilmer has throat cancer.
Dude,

1677
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:43,320
it's fucking,
it's not cool.

1678
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:45,680
And then you got like Dolph lundgren 
there.

1679
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:49,190
I had know Val kilmer throat cancer.
That's.

1680
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:51,240
Oh yeah,
if he's not old,

1681
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:55,650
he's like 45 or something like that or 
fuck man.

1682
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,130
So it was just,
it was a weird kind of experience.

1683
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,770
It was awesome and it was also not 
awesome,

1684
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:04,920
dude.
Val kilmer is shit in tombstone.

1685
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:08,910
Was it say spotted with a breathing aid?
Oh,

1686
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:11,100
wow.
Yeah,

1687
01:12:11,101 --> 01:12:12,840
it's terrible.
Fuck man.

1688
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,910
Yeah,
it's a fucking.

1689
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,060
It's terrible.
Well,

1690
01:12:15,061 --> 01:12:20,061
he's had some crazy ups and downs with 
his weight to the point where you gotta 

1691
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:21,010
go like,
Oh,

1692
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,160
like look at those pictures of him on 
the far right.

1693
01:12:23,161 --> 01:12:24,870
Let's look at those pictures.
Wow.

1694
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:29,370
That was in the massive alcoholic days.
I mean,

1695
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:34,400
there's nothing that does that to you 
like that other than massive eating and 

1696
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,200
alcoholism.
That's so sad.

1697
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,170
It's weird,
man.

1698
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,200
People just abuse the shit out of their 
body like that.

1699
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:47,070
What about size road cancer?
What happened to him?

1700
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,180
He was,
you know,

1701
01:12:48,181 --> 01:12:49,230
look,
let's look at him.

1702
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,520
Where's he at?
He was,

1703
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,190
he's a friend of mine in the.
I don't know.

1704
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,110
He's.
He has used rugged,

1705
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:57,570
some serious drug issues.
Yeah.

1706
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,100
He was like,
he's a great actor.

1707
01:12:59,101 --> 01:13:00,220
Right?
Fuck off.

1708
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,320
I'll tune amazing holiday movies.
He's a savage.

1709
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,550
Yeah,
but I saw Michael Madsen there too.

1710
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,670
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

1711
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,150
I know.
It was like.

1712
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:14,430
Oh,
bummer.

1713
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:15,500
Well you have a good sense

1714
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:19,300
humor about the demise of your film 
career.

1715
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:24,320
Yeah,
I've seen you joke around about it on 

1716
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:24,320
stage about like,
you know,

1717
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:24,410
trying to get TMZ,
like,

1718
01:13:24,411 --> 01:13:24,830
hey

1719
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:26,730
to me man,
I'm over here.

1720
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:29,040
Yeah,
you have to.

1721
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:29,790
Yes.
Yeah,

1722
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:34,791
I think you have to.
And the fact is I still have all my 

1723
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:34,791
money.
Yeah.

1724
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:36,900
So I didn't like you didn't go crazy.
No,

1725
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:38,910
no,
it's still in my house.

1726
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:40,710
I don't live in it.
I live in silver lake.

1727
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:43,420
I have an apartment out there which I 
enjoy.

1728
01:13:43,421 --> 01:13:44,190
I like silver,
like,

1729
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,490
but um,
what I like to live in my big mansion up

1730
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:49,560
in the hill.
I to rent it out.

1731
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,460
Yeah,
I leased it out.

1732
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:51,570
That's smart.
Yeah.

1733
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:53,040
At least it had to do it.
Yeah.

1734
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,750
And I'm,
I'm one person.

1735
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:55,950
Right.
So,

1736
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,170
um,
yeah,

1737
01:13:58,171 --> 01:14:00,300
that was silver lake.
I like it.

1738
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,970
It's pretty cool.
I've never understood silver.

1739
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:07,140
Like it's um,
it's no one bugs you there,

1740
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:09,240
there no tour buses,
there's no billboards,

1741
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:11,500
there's just no starbucks.
There's none of stuff.

1742
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:12,730
It's different than the valley.

1743
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:16,060
It's like all like really cool 
restaurants.

1744
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:21,061
Really cool bars.
A really nice people are very quiet,

1745
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:22,150
you know,
you sit,

1746
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:23,770
you can write,
it's very creative.

1747
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:26,920
It reminds the East village in New York.
That's the vibe.

1748
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,660
Yeah.
So if you ever go out to the east,

1749
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:30,280
so it's like low speed.
I know bill,

1750
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:33,160
Bill Burr lives in Los Felis and like 
that whole area.

1751
01:14:33,161 --> 01:14:38,161
It's pretty cool.
And the thing that I really like about 

1752
01:14:38,161 --> 01:14:38,980
it is the architecture there is still 
old Hollywood.

1753
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:44,670
I love the old buildings.
The building that I live in is like in 

1754
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:47,521
the 19 twenties.
So it's got that history and I love 

1755
01:14:47,521 --> 01:14:47,521
that,
you know,

1756
01:14:47,521 --> 01:14:50,080
I love that kind of that history.
Like I don't like sunset now.

1757
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,330
I drive by sunset.
I kind of like,

1758
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,630
you know what I mean?
Like the store and what the Roxy and the

1759
01:14:55,631 --> 01:14:57,400
rainbow.
The only places left.

1760
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,330
I know,
right?

1761
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,060
Isn't aware of when they like when they 
chopped down the house of Blues.

1762
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,130
It's weird.
The cool thing is the view now,

1763
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,970
the view from the stores sick.
Yeah.

1764
01:15:04,971 --> 01:15:07,300
But what they're probably going to do is
build something bigger though.

1765
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:09,970
They're going to go to hotel,
they're going to build a high rise.

1766
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:12,220
What do you think about the store in the
future of the store?

1767
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,480
You're.
I mean,

1768
01:15:13,481 --> 01:15:14,710
you're talking about it.

1769
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:17,140
It's never been doing better than it is 
now.

1770
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:20,770
It's amazing how packed it is.
I mean it's sold out every night.

1771
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:21,640
It's constant.

1772
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:23,940
What do you think about the building 
itself?

1773
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:29,690
In what way?
Keeping it or not keeping it to 

1774
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:29,690
building.
What else would you do?

1775
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:31,530
Well,
I mean I wouldn't do it,

1776
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:36,531
but I'm just saying if someone came in 
and offered a whole bunch of money to 

1777
01:15:36,531 --> 01:15:37,620
knock it down and build a hotel,
dude,

1778
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:38,730
I mean,
what would you think?

1779
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:41,360
Well,
it would suck for comedy for sure,

1780
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,150
but the laugh factory is probably not 
doing so hot.

1781
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,830
Your probably take that motherfucker 
over.

1782
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:49,620
Take the laugh factory.
I just moved down the street,

1783
01:15:49,621 --> 01:15:51,020
but the room's not that.
That

1784
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:52,050
great.
Have a room.

1785
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,510
No,
but you might do something else.

1786
01:15:55,110 --> 01:16:00,110
Well,
the thing is the comedy store is 

1787
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:00,110
perfect.
That's part of the problem had been.

1788
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:02,580
It literally is perfect for me.
You have three different,

1789
01:16:02,581 --> 01:16:04,410
like Wednesday night.
I did the hat trick,

1790
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:07,590
I started out in the belly room.
I'd go Tuesday night.

1791
01:16:07,591 --> 01:16:10,270
I started on the belly room,
I did a set in the main room and I did a

1792
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:10,840
set in the.
Oh,

1793
01:16:10,841 --> 01:16:11,760
are,
you know,

1794
01:16:11,761 --> 01:16:14,520
there's not a place in the country where
you could do that.

1795
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:17,190
Well,
you can perform in front of 90 people,

1796
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:21,020
400 people and 150 people.
I mean,

1797
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:24,520
and every show was sold out to a fucking
Tuesday night man,

1798
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,690
Tuesday night,
three sold out shows in Hollywood,

1799
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:32,810
you know,
and for me to work out my material like 

1800
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:34,050
it's so invaluable.
You know,

1801
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,780
I like to do the Ice House.
I go to the ice house last night,

1802
01:16:36,781 --> 01:16:41,781
did like 35 minutes and I did it with 
Andrew Santino and Tom Segura and Tom 

1803
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:48,050
Papa and frank Castillo and you know,
it's just these killer lineups and you 

1804
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,980
get awesome shows that people get to 
have a great time.

1805
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:53,040
You get to work out and fuck around and 
like these,

1806
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,710
these clubs around here.
So critical.

1807
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,000
There's,
they're so important.

1808
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,420
Someone came along and bought the comedy
store.

1809
01:17:00,421 --> 01:17:02,660
I mean,
it would be the end of a giant Arrow.

1810
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:03,840
It would be devastating.

1811
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:10,440
What do you think about it?
I think what my mom thinks is leave 

1812
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:10,440
alone.

1813
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,290
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't knock it down.

1814
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:13,910
Well,
who would be responsible?

1815
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:14,490
Who,
who,

1816
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:15,290
who,
uh,

1817
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,820
is in charge now.
Well,

1818
01:17:16,821 --> 01:17:19,610
I'm not in charge.
So it was it Peter.

1819
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:20,750
Peter.
Yeah.

1820
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:21,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

1821
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,350
Well,
the good thing is that the common starts

1822
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:27,770
making money now and a lot of money.
It's doing really well.

1823
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,910
Hopefully that's coming around for sure.
My pleasure.

1824
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:34,180
I hope it keeps,
keeps coming and I keep hoping,

1825
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,000
I mean,
look,

1826
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:37,280
it's the most iconic comedy club in the 
history of that.

1827
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,120
I agree.
You know,

1828
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,640
it's my heart,
you know what I mean?

1829
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:43,460
It's where I've been my whole life.
I walk into that place every day.

1830
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:45,680
It feel like I'm walking inside of my 
mom,

1831
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,450
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1832
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:50,750
You know what I mean?
Like I really feel like I'm there.

1833
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:52,580
I feel her,
don't you?

1834
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,320
Oh yeah.
And it's like,

1835
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:55,670
you know,
the bar in the,

1836
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,370
uh,
in the back of the back room,

1837
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:00,800
that bar,
I took it from the Doe Haney House.

1838
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:02,870
Oh,
that's right.

1839
01:18:02,871 --> 01:18:03,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

1840
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,050
Because that bar was,
was uh,

1841
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:11,740
it was in my mom's house and that's the 
bar that can ascend in prior and 

1842
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:15,521
everyone got fucked up on.
We sold the house and I was cleaning it 

1843
01:18:15,711 --> 01:18:16,500
out,
you know,

1844
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,010
that's one of the things in the doc 
series is I'm like,

1845
01:18:19,011 --> 01:18:23,660
keep this bar because it's great.
And then I had one Carlos pick it up and

1846
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:25,080
we brought it over to,
you know,

1847
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,290
to Eric in the back,
back room.

1848
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:30,320
And we saved it for you guys are 
amazing.

1849
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,200
I did that,
you know,

1850
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,030
so the comics can have that feeling of 
like,

1851
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,730
because that bar,
the door Haney house was,

1852
01:18:37,731 --> 01:18:40,440
is as iconic as the comedy store.
Yeah.

1853
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:45,760
You know,
because that's the house that was like 

1854
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:45,760
the comedy mansion.
But you.

1855
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,620
No,
no,

1856
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:47,750
no.
The Doj Haney House.

1857
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:50,900
Which mom said I never went to that,
but I almost bought crust hill.

1858
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:56,200
Okay.
When Chris tells for sale for years 

1859
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:56,200
back,
that would've been perfect for you.

1860
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:57,860
That would have a.
The vibe.

1861
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:01,850
It was just I lived there for a while to
living right there.

1862
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,560
Yeah.
It was like,

1863
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:07,570
this is just too derelict.
Like I've always been the guy who likes 

1864
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:11,411
to live away from stuff and then like 
come in and then get some quiet and 

1865
01:19:11,411 --> 01:19:15,620
peace or like this might be too much to 
be like right above the comedy store and

1866
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:18,410
just Lord it might be look at my 
burnout,

1867
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:22,310
you know what I mean,
what I'm saying.

1868
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,560
But like that room,
it's interesting because that,

1869
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:28,510
that back bar is a new place but it 
doesn't feel like a new place.

1870
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:33,230
It feels like probably because of that 
bar and also because it's in the store.

1871
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:35,150
Right.
But it's also the old video room.

1872
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:36,590
Right.
That's where my mom,

1873
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,870
it was like the comedy channel.
That's where she kept all her old video.

1874
01:19:39,871 --> 01:19:42,410
So it feels like,
you know that that bar is amazing.

1875
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:43,180
That vibe.
Yeah.

1876
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:47,830
The coolest place you go back then ron 
was on his hair around.

1877
01:19:47,831 --> 01:19:50,450
It doesn't work for me Bro.
You know what I mean?

1878
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:51,950
That's not cool.
Bro.

1879
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,980
Was hilarious.
What's going on in several areas.

1880
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:59,500
He is,
I mean,

1881
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:02,470
it's a great crew there now.
I mean there's so many funny comments.

1882
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,950
It's really an amazing time.
It's also like a lot of people like for,

1883
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,580
because I've seen the decades

1884
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:13,580
of it,
there's still nothing like the Kennison 

1885
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:13,580
and the prior days,
you know,

1886
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,930
like I watch everyone in the back and 
I'm like they're killing,

1887
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:19,390
but for some reason it just doesn't feel
like I felt

1888
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:24,460
when I was say reasons why?
Because back then they never been 

1889
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:24,760
anything like that.
You know,

1890
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,500
when you think about prior,
before prior came around,

1891
01:20:27,501 --> 01:20:29,570
who the fuck was like prior?
No one,

1892
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:34,780
you know,
and chemists in Kennison was a 

1893
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:36,581
completely unique kind of talent.
There's never been anybody like him 

1894
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:37,880
before and so now you've seen so much 
since then.

1895
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:42,440
They'll never be that uniquely innocent 
time where people are like Jesus,

1896
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:44,510
but,
but you know,

1897
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,620
to respond to the,
the prior thing when he would,

1898
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:53,650
because I saw him for years,
develop this show there at the store 

1899
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:55,130
when he would walk on stage and they 
would say,

1900
01:20:55,131 --> 01:20:56,840
ladies and gentleman,
Richard Pryor,

1901
01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:02,110
it was like fucking Jesus.
It was like people like literally like 

1902
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:02,170
with stand up,

1903
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:03,700
no way.
Fuck.

1904
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:06,760
It was like that type of shit.
Like Elvis.

1905
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:07,990
Yeah,
like that type of shit.

1906
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:09,690
So I.
So I saw that in

1907
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:12,760
and there was something.
So obviously he was just so funny.

1908
01:21:12,761 --> 01:21:13,990
Dude.
You know what I mean?

1909
01:21:13,991 --> 01:21:17,500
Like even if his material wasn't funny 
that night,

1910
01:21:17,501 --> 01:21:18,460
he was just funny.

1911
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:23,640
There is a genius,
I think a real comedy genius and 

1912
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,590
probably one of the most influential 
standup comedians ever.

1913
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:30,620
Him and Kennison can think kinison.
I mean I think obviously prior was 

1914
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,080
before my Kennison learned a lot from 
prior,

1915
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,620
but Kennison was very groundbreaking in 
a lot of way.

1916
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:35,940
Like there's never been anybody like 
him.

1917
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:40,970
Well yeah.
And it's also before Sam got into too 

1918
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:41,190
much of the drugs that he had,
that five year run,

1919
01:21:41,191 --> 01:21:46,191
which was fucking insane.
I didn't know I was on that run to with 

1920
01:21:46,191 --> 01:21:49,600
him,
was opening for him for a while on the 

1921
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:49,950
road and then like he started getting,
you know what I mean?

1922
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:51,240
He started going off the.

1923
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:52,820
Yeah,
nobody can sustain that.

1924
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:53,480
Especially.
I mean,

1925
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:57,230
did you ever read his brother's book?
I didn't read.

1926
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:58,370
No,
I didn't scrape book.

1927
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:03,820
And his brother sort of talks about how 
Sam just kind of start stop writing 

1928
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:07,811
because he was partying all the time and
this material suffered and you could 

1929
01:22:07,811 --> 01:22:10,310
really feel the difference and nobody 
could live that rock and roll crazy drug

1930
