1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,810
Boom, Corey Anderson, ladies
and gentlemen, what's up?
How are you man going on?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,920
Joe Joey's,
they finally did it,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,670
finally did it and got
some techno Huntin as well.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,880
I told you about that game. That game is
very addictive, isn't it? I worry, right?

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,070
Trying to get back out there, do some more
when it's over. So itchy, right? Yeah.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,930
Yeah. No, it's amazing man
that, that game. Incredible.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,450
How long have you been bow hunting for?

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,080
I've been bow hunting since I was 16
or 17 I've been hunting my whole life.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,730
Wow. What switched you over
to bow hunting? I'm a high
school teammate, actually.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,090
I used to go rabbit hunting stuff with
a shotgun and I've been shooting a bow

11
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:40,660
since I was like 12 or 11 just 3d
shooting a year. Bowhunter weirdly,

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,260
you can hunt with this. He's like,
yeah, like we go hunt all the time.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,830
So one day before school he picked me up
and like went over to my buddy's house

14
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,601
and got up in the stand.

15
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,690
When he got in the stand I couldn't
climb cause he know what I was doing.

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,210
I got stuck at the bottom of the tree,
you know, I'm a bowl on my lap so,

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,840
but that was my first time and after
that I just kept going every now and then

18
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,280
in between practices and whatnot.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,630
But now when I got time between fighting
or whatnot, I'm all hunting. That's it.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,020
Oh, I could tell by your Instagram.
I follow your Instagram, all your,

21
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,420
you're constantly shooting and hunting,

22
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:13,860
practicing and it gets in your blood.
Let me just like fighting. Like I said,

23
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:14,900
we're doing,
taking the hunters,

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
I do it so much just muscle
memory and like everybody thinks,

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,830
oh you spend too much time hunting, you're
not training. When I go win a fight,

26
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,030
they're like, oh that was impressive. Like
I still train two or three times a day,

27
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:27,180
but I get home from the gym and
I always have a bowl on my truck.

28
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,940
I have three bowls on one is
always on my truck. So I pulled up,

29
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:32,880
popped the doors open, grab my
speaker and the target is right there.

30
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,080
Get like 30 to 60 shots and then go in
and spend time with the family, eat,

31
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:37,914
go back to the gym,

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,460
go to the range and shoot indoors and
it's dark and I'm always shooting.

33
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:45,930
I just enjoy it. Wow. So is it like a
part of meditation for you, do you think?

34
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,850
100% coming off the OSP fight.

35
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:50,310
That was actually the first
time I find it in Jersey.

36
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:54,790
I've been in Jersey since 2014 when the
show came out and I have to Osp fight

37
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,090
and all that stuff and everybody told
him like don't pay it to you was winning

38
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,990
that fight you got caught.

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,540
Don't let the people getting your
head and tell you you're not there.

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,450
So actually the next day I went home and
went and bought my hunting license and

41
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,840
bought a Standing Hunting Jersey for
the first time and that helped me.

42
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,440
I didn't think about it all from November
to February 1st I was in the tree

43
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,750
saying every day,
and I went back to training,

44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,070
like full camp with everything and my
mind, I forgot all about that OSP fight.

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,590
And that's when I told my wife,
I found my balance. You know,

46
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:23,430
the thing was I was always in the gym
and that's why the name 25 eight came

47
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:27,000
because Corey never at the time I didn't
do anything else with train. You know,

48
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,700
we're trained to go to the
gym and train to go therapy,

49
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:33,750
go back to the gym and train, go home,
ruin, go to the garage at the heavy bat,

50
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,820
go to Mark Harris hip
pads and go train again.

51
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,840
So like I was telling the wheel on the
way here, my first one in UFC and I say,

52
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:42,690
oh, Cory's grew. He's gotten bigger,
they haul. It's been a big guy.

53
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,550
I was 300 pounds one time, but when I
got down to two oh five I was so myself.

54
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,220
I don't want to get heavier than like
two 10 to 12 so every day I had like a

55
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,740
goal. I wanted to end the day off, no.

56
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:56,970
Hebard and to 12 so I was like two 15
from eating too much and it's 10 o'clock

57
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:59,890
at night. I got to lace up and
go for a run. So I was all,

58
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:03,970
every morning I'll wake up at two 10 so
that's why I took the fight like young

59
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,560
black boy was on two three weeks notice,

60
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,830
five Maldonado in Brazil on a week notice
because I didn't have to cut weight.

61
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,300
It was like, okay, just go.

62
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,570
But when I got to Jimmy Manual and he
told me at the bar, he's like, Bro,

63
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:15,250
you're a good fighter.
He just too small.

64
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,870
Like I weighed in Friday and Saturday I
slept in the cage looking at exact same.

65
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:24,010
I gained like six pounds and he told me,
you gotta eat, you gotta feed yourself.

66
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,151
And after I did that,

67
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,730
that was probably the best advice I ever
got from a fighter because now I walk

68
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,310
around like two 35 and I
feel great like the last,

69
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,080
well fight with Glover on two weeks.

70
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:35,980
Notice I was two 36 I got the weight
off and hydrated right back up and felt

71
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:39,060
fine. Fantastic. And we're not there
and did my thing because I teach,

72
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:40,030
treat my body right now.

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,160
So your two 36 up until like how far out
of the fights and I'll try to stay at

74
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:50,161
least 230230230 one until like two weeks
out and I started tapering down to 25

75
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,350
area and just get 20 pounds
of water off a lot of water,

76
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:57,300
drinking the Waterloo and
then Tuesday is the first.

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,500
I hit it hard and just
start trimming down.

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,760
So you feel like the extra
pounds helps you in what way?

79
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,460
At recovery as we are
getting rocked as well.

80
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,700
Like that was the thing in college my
coach was always trained and rest and

81
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:12,520
we're going to go a whole practice.
Nobody go get a water.

82
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,920
If I see anybody go to the waterfowl,
we doing sprints,

83
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,150
whatever that mean you weak,
you know.

84
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:20,590
And it was great cause we train and in
the map you see guys gasping for water in

85
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:22,570
third period we all
standing tall ready to go.

86
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,690
And I had that same mentality when it
came to fighting cause you gotta think now

87
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:28,090
he's taking blows to the head.
So I got to keep water,

88
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,170
keep that brain hydrated because if I'm
dehydrated that one shot is lights out.

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,810
You don't have anything to help
take it. So it's like, like I said,

90
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:36,370
after LSP fight and the
hunting and everything,

91
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:40,420
I just went back and did a lot of figuring
things out before that Pat Cummings

92
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:44,650
fight. And I just knew what I had to do
to be the best me. And uh, like I said,

93
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,860
getting bigger, stronger, not
wearing about keeping my weight low,

94
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,990
the weight going to come off.
It's going to be hard sometimes,

95
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,080
but it's gonna come off, you know?
But that's when I will not miss.

96
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:56,620
What if I got to kill myself. I'm ended
up in the hospital before I miss. Wait.

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,430
So putting all that together and
I feel like I have the recipe.

98
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,150
So the recipe was, um, did
you start weightlifting?

99
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:07,900
Like what did you do to pack on the extra
weight? Weight lifting was a big thing.

100
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,810
Big Key to my brother first before I had
the strength and conditioning coaches

101
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,500
that was on board. My coach before
it was great for cargo, same guy,

102
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:18,130
frank Yeager hat and we had conduct
cardio and we were getting strong but it

103
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,630
wasn't like size building shrunk.

104
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,540
It was like mobility strength
to punch and keep the cardio up.

105
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,591
And then my brother,

106
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:27,460
he had a contract to play pro ball
back in like 2000 or whatever.

107
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,180
So he knew like all the combine list and
whatever. He hit me up and said, Bro,

108
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:34,240
we got to get bigger. Like we
got you, you, your dominant.

109
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,400
Like you look at these guys who fight,
they say you're going to lose.

110
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,110
You go out there and you
dominant in your small.

111
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,680
So imagine if you put the size on
it, you've got the power, you will,

112
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,650
you can dominate these guys for real.
So he flew out like I fly off a week,

113
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:48,310
you put me on the right diet and how
y'all lifted in the NFL camps or whatnot

114
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,170
and we get stronger. So she literally had
me on compound lifts every day eating.

115
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,910
Like I said, I got the freezer
full of deer. Me, he's like,

116
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:57,010
you got all the stuff you need.
You got protein right here.

117
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,100
Have the Jenny go grab my wife, go grab
rice and potatoes and you just eat meat,

118
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:05,240
potatoes, rice, eat eggs
for meat, potatoes and rice.
Everything you eat, put meat,

119
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,060
potatoes and rice and everything
and you're going to get that aside.

120
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,300
I promise you in the strength and
everything would come and sure enough,

121
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,390
I just saw it. I want it from like
after. This was after the Jimmy fight,

122
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:18,260
he showed up and it worked out as well.
I met my supplement sponsor,

123
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:22,460
but we went out to the buffet. Like I had
a good workout. We don't eat the buffet,

124
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,880
eat as much with carb up. And actually
while I was there, a pile of nutrition,

125
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:28,350
the owner of myself going to come
and he's like [inaudible], right?

126
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,960
Like I'm a huge fan.
I would love to work with you,

127
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,750
my brother that's made it happen.
Protein right there.

128
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,520
Get a bottle of protein from him.

129
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,960
We're going to start mixing
this sandwich once your meat,

130
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,920
potatoes or rice protein shake instantly
and he's put me on a whole plan and

131
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,430
when he left he left me a whole little
list on the frigerator and I still got it

132
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:46,910
there and I don't need it any more.
But that's the thing. Each and meat,

133
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:50,420
potatoes and rice. Four or five days
in the morning, it's got a cup of rice.

134
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,330
Put some venison or hard,

135
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:55,250
whatever meat I'm eating that day and it
put some vegetables and a little bit of

136
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,970
potatoes or so I can get a big old meal,
carve it up and then go hit the gym.

137
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,600
Then when you're done, kill your protein
shake, come on, meat, potatoes, rice.

138
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,380
How much difference is your diet
doing this than it was before? I mean,

139
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:06,741
it's crazy.

140
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:09,910
You ask my teammates now and they say
we seen a difference or how big you got.

141
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,790
Even Mark Henry,

142
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,840
I'll say miss the other day for the
first time with him and probably like a

143
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,350
couple of weeks, whatever in his basement.
And I was still moving. Fascinating.

144
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,070
I'm like Bro, you got huge like I
lifted the e coach. Yeah. You know,

145
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:25,300
so I used to work miss holding
yourself back before. Yeah,

146
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,370
100% and then probably
draining yourself too much.

147
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:30,590
But you all that weight cutting
and all that, uh, you know,

148
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,320
getting it down before
the actual fight itself.

149
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:36,080
All the extra running and everything.
Like even on the show,

150
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,540
like we were finished eating and that's
when I find out you can cut weight in

151
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,720
the hot tub. I didn't notice cough fall
headway before the ultimate fighter.

152
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,910
The Guy said, well, you can lose
weight and high tail. I was like, what?

153
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,700
And everybody was sitting the hots
off like 40 50 minutes and I get out,

154
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,400
I lost all my weight. I'm at
two oh six. Oh this is great.

155
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,110
So we eat a bunch like even one day.

156
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:54,240
Frankie and the coaches brought
in and out burgers over, you know,

157
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:57,200
we ate and watched the fights and I just
sat in his hot tub for like 40 minutes

158
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:00,080
and got all the weight off down the two
teeth they got and where I wanted to be.

159
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,960
I was like, Bro, you can get up.
So I'm like Nah, cause we fight.

160
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:05,660
We never know when we're going to fight.
He wins tomorrow on Tuesday.

161
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,850
I might be fighting Thursday.
I don't want to have to worry about that.

162
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,800
I was always scared of the weight cut.

163
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,710
If you getting in the sauna and or
getting a hot tub, losing all the weight,

164
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,140
that's just water weight though.
Right?

165
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,510
Even if you're down like
where you want to be,

166
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:19,620
you're still going to have
to cut more water. Yeah.

167
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,180
To get to where you need to be to do a
five. Yeah. But you could ask my wife,

168
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:25,640
I have the worst,
not now,

169
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,310
but before I didn't know anything about
nutrition because I wrestled heavy

170
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,540
weight from freshman year in high school,

171
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,780
my senior year in college and I fought
heavyweight until the ultimate fighter.

172
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,080
So I never had to worry about the Diet.
You know? I used to eat ramen noodles.

173
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,680
I remember moving in my first time
fighting Ben Asher and took me up to Rufus

174
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,830
Sport and I moved in the firehouse and
everybody eating like chicken filets and

175
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,920
salmon. I came in with a big old box
around it and thinking chunky new suit.

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,340
I was like, what are you doing?
Like this? Is this how he like, Bro,

177
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,200
that's not going to work.
What do you mean?

178
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,150
Like I train everyday
and I eat the same stuff.

179
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,440
Eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast
and they all cooking like Yo, that's,

180
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,710
that's not healthy.
Like it works for me.

181
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,110
But then when it came time to go to
two oh five the first time it's like,

182
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:05,070
oh this, this is a working from
me. I have to figure something out.

183
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,280
What do you feel the difference
between like eating nonsense,

184
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:12,420
like ramen and then eating healthy food?
Like what was the big shift?

185
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,870
You just have more energy really?
Because in wrestling that's how we ate.

186
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,940
You know? Definitely in
college you ain't got no money.

187
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,230
We go to Walmart long Saturday,
Sunday, get a big old box of rhyming.

188
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,500
I used to get spaghetti sauce and it's
cooked nude and put spaghetti sauce on it,

189
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:29,970
you know, uh, Canada's soup brought out
the can you eating, stuff like that.

190
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,000
But you train all day so it doesn't
really get to stick in your body and you

191
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:36,540
don't really feel the difference in
energy because you never really ate clean

192
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,550
eating.
Cafeteria food is packed with grease.

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,090
But now it's like we got
meal prep companies and stuff
out and you try all that

194
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,130
different stuff.
And then my wife fights too,

195
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:46,590
so she fought like one 20
so she was always dieting.

196
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,760
So when she's cutting weight,

197
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,490
I eat clean and I would notice
a difference in my energy.

198
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:51,690
Like I wake up a lot earlier,

199
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,750
I can go longer that day and
the night I'm not crashing.

200
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,060
I'm like peacefully put myself in bed,

201
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,930
watch TV and fall asleep when we got all
that sugar and all this stuff and you

202
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:03,490
feel like crap my end of the day you
kind of like, you just fighting you,

203
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:07,390
you don't have control anymore. We also
have the advantage of the best protein.

204
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,300
The fact that you have, how many did
you say shot 13. A lot of protein,

205
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:13,980
lots of protein,
clean,

206
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:18,000
wild protein and I got half
that meets still in Texas.

207
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,250
That never got actually just engage.
You got it.

208
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:23,670
And I heard they went hunting together
one time he gave me his coach,

209
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:26,690
Lou colonial, whatever.
And we put the meal,

210
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,090
I say his last name but they put the meat
in the same place and we said some of

211
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:33,660
this goes to Corey and the other part
go to Justin where they sent all of it

212
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:36,780
down to Justin and his camp. But
aside, I had a freezer full anyway.

213
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:40,920
I had no space. Yeah, he's another one.
Ray Borg. He's another he bow hunts.

214
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,130
Chad Mendez, bow hunts, Tj
Dillashaw bow hunts. Uh, when we,

215
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,650
we could probably keep
going down the line.

216
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,170
There's a lot of profilers who bow hunt.

217
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,040
Well let's put it out there before we get
too far. Justin. But he can't bow hunt.

218
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:53,730
He can,

219
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,440
we had with a crossbow on her ranch and
we pushed like everybody had got him and

220
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,710
he kept missing.
We put him in a corner guy,

221
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,410
we're gonna all like drive him
to be ready Bro. Just shoot

222
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,370
some out.
All these big old deer come,

223
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:12,660
but he's still miss like they was probably
10 yards to the 50 or he mills like

224
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,100
crossbow, the crossbow, like, Bro, how the
hell did you miss? Like you can't shoot.

225
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,260
Then they went to another ranch
and the guy gave him a gun.

226
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,040
Like he won't do a gun instead he
killed him with a gun. But he has a,

227
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,780
his vision is not the best right now.

228
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,130
What is wrong with his vision and
his energy? You know, he's kind of,

229
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,810
I mean he's a great guy. He's his
energy, bad energy. Kind of like focus.

230
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:34,644
That's what I mean.

231
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,710
Like it's hard him to like sit still
like we in the trees or in this loft and

232
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:42,660
he's like shadow boxer. So
like Bro, you gotta chill,

233
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,920
calm down when you're hunting.
Some people can't hang out in the stands,

234
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,530
they can't stand.
It's hard for them.

235
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:52,380
It's harder for them than
just a spot in stock.

236
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,370
Just walking in the mountains for all day.

237
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:58,100
It's easier for them than to just
stay put and do nothing. Yeah,

238
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,920
it's just sitting there quiet.
Um, I went with a buddy,

239
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,140
we went and Turkey and this is my first
week Turkey hunting this year and he's

240
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,890
never heard it before.
He's actually my Archie pardon?

241
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,360
I taught him how to shoot bow like 15
weeks ago and he's actually got pretty

242
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,890
good. He was hitting like all bulls
eyes and league and he's like,

243
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,680
I want to go hunting with you.
So he sat in the blind,

244
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,770
not telling me was going out there like,
Bro, we get out here, you got to do,

245
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,540
you can't move like we in the blind,

246
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,480
but that one window to turkeys can see
us if you move and they're going to see

247
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:25,460
you and they got good hearing excuses.
You got to chill out. So I'm like,

248
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,850
I'm going to put the decoys up.
Just sit down. I turned around,

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,310
he's like walk around like, what are
you doing? I'm covering the blind.

250
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:34,810
If you got like a little bitty Twiggs he
like, Bro, we don't have time to blind.

251
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:38,890
He's like, I seen it on youtube. It's
like getting the blind. I was like,

252
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,510
pro getting the block,
does it work? Does it work?

253
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,390
We're not going not kill anything. And you
know, talking to like call, call, call,

254
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,100
call was like, do it, can't do it. I was,
they get bored. It was like, exactly.

255
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,980
He just attention span. Some
people don't, they can't sit there.

256
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,810
I could sit there for a whole day from
sunup to sundown. I'm fine with that.

257
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,870
I'm fine pieces,
listen to the birds and watch the animals.

258
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,810
I have my phone checking my phone every
once in a while. But some people they,

259
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,590
they don't have that piece.
They need to be talking to doing things.

260
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:13,360
That's real add, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's
uh, it's, it's a weird mental exercise.

261
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,900
Just sit there and do nothing and just
wait for an animal to come to you.

262
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:18,220
And it seems like it would be easy,

263
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:22,680
but after a while it starts fucking with
your head. You know, it's, it's, um,

264
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,650
it's a mental exercise. The thing that's
crazy. I can do that in a tree stand.

265
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,520
But in college I couldn't focus a shit
and that's cool. Yeah. If I'm, even now,

266
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:33,340
if I go to like a meeting or something
and people are talking and I was like,

267
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:36,540
those, no, it's the, I can't sit
there, but that treats, I could sit.

268
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,580
Why wait for hours though?

269
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:41,650
You're waiting for something
that's very specific.

270
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,480
If you're doing something
you don't want to do.

271
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,120
A guy like you who burns off
so much energy in the day,

272
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,660
your body is probably like, this is
boring as fuck. Let's just not out. Yeah.

273
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,610
Well let's just train in six hours a day.
It's the same way at home.

274
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,550
I mean, my wife said you, you never
stop moving. Just hang out. You know,

275
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,210
Willis and I'd be baby to have my baby
and I'm doing something with the camera,

276
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,890
editing my youtube channel, so I can't
just sit down until I fall asleep.

277
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,010
How to do something. But like when it's
time just relaxed, like it's Sunday,

278
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:12,040
we're just gonna sit here and watch TV,
sit down five minutes and I'm out.

279
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,630
What'd you think wouldn't move like,
Huh? My bad babe. I fell asleep.

280
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,230
Yeah. Well, if you're a guy
who trains as much as you,

281
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:23,260
I mean every chance your
body gets to actually rest,

282
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,820
your body's probably like right about now.
It's a good time. It doesn't take much.

283
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:31,360
We're getting the car.
Probiotics are hours driving am

284
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,740
Oh, have to drive. Well yeah, my bad bay.

285
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,660
Well a guy who works as hard as you do
because one of the things that you are

286
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,290
known for man is your cardio.

287
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:45,400
You have crazy fucking cardio and you
notice it and fights where around the

288
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:49,240
second and the third round I start seeing
your opponents start to slow down a

289
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:52,100
little bit and then you ramp it.
[inaudible] face.

290
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,120
A perfect example.

291
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,930
That was a great five for you
because that guy's a tank is a tank.

292
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,590
Very scary dude. Hits really
fucking hard, strong as shit.

293
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,060
But he's a, he's a guy that
relies on that explosive power.

294
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:09,170
He's like a sprinter and a lot of ways
and you can only do that for so long and

295
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:14,090
you could say like somewhere around the
second round it was real obvious that

296
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:17,690
you weren't slowing down at all and he
was taking some big deep breaths and it's

297
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:20,510
just, it's harder for him. Have
you always had that kind of cardio?

298
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,830
I mean, I got it in the restaurant. I
guess I was big, you know, and I was,

299
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,800
especially when I got to 300 pounds
and I was still working cardio,

300
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,800
trying to get down as a
heavyweight to wrestle and B,

301
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,260
I always studied little guys film,
you know,

302
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,960
like the Hendrix udo film to shit
like that when I was in college.

303
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:38,020
That's just what I'll wash. My clothes
are like wash heavyweights. Nobody. Nah,

304
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,230
I wanna move. I won't footwork. I
want to fake, I want to take shots.

305
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,980
Like I lead my team and take downs as
a heavyweight because I moved around.

306
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:47,830
He's a big guy and the same
thing I've had matched one match.

307
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,260
The guy was beating me.
What?

308
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,990
15 one if you need one more point
to text me going to the third point,

309
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,900
but he in third round but he
gas and I was still going.

310
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,140
I came back and beat them in overtime
because I can just keep going.

311
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:02,110
I was the mindset guys is
going to break eventually.

312
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,990
My coach always says act fresh.
Even if you're tired, his dog,

313
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:07,480
she stand up and act
fresh like no matter what,

314
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,560
look fresh and you'll be surprised how
your mind take over your realized later

315
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:14,860
on you're not really tired and when
you're tired keep pushing because the next

316
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:18,160
time you usually get tired around that
three minute mark it and make it to about

317
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:19,150
the seven,
eight minutes.

318
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,240
There's like 15 and you start doing those
grime managers and you'd go 30 minutes

319
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,510
lie and when it's done I'm able to walk,
shake,

320
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:27,630
code your hand and go grab another
partner or we'll get on the treadmill is

321
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:29,500
because we always push as a big guy.

322
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,580
So you've got to imagine when I came
down to two oh five it was like, yeah,

323
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,540
it was crazy. Like this is, this is
like magic. I can do this all day.

324
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,550
Coach fired rounds at first.
Jim,

325
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,190
my five round fight with Jimmy when
they called my boss the main event.

326
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:46,180
Now you got to train six rounds like okay,
like it was moving the cage.

327
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,970
We did three rounds mark like you know
you're doing six a day. That's fine.

328
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,480
Gave me three new partners went and
they was tired and I'll still good like,

329
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:54,970
dude, your cardio was a
crazy, it's just a mentor.

330
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,980
Even when I'm tired I'll never show it.
He's like,

331
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:59,350
I just got to act fresh and get
through it. It can only last so long.

332
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,580
My father told me I forever.

333
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,860
It is a weird thing, isn't it? That
your mind can give you more energy.

334
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:07,170
Like you know that feeling that sometimes
you're on a treadmill or something

335
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:10,620
like that and you're running and a
great song comes on and all of a sudden

336
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:13,380
you're like, Woo. You like feel it.

337
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:16,440
Like you got like all of a sudden extra
like where's it every time it's coming

338
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:20,410
from your mind, your mind. I
wouldn't beat the uptown pumping.

339
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,030
Are you to start dancing while you're
running in like three to five minutes.

340
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,040
I have a loan.
That song gets you like on a sprint.

341
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,810
Then once that song and then you really
feel it, the tone change. Ah, Shit.

342
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:33,300
I'm tired of it. Crazy
isn't it? That that's some,

343
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:37,620
there's a switch in your mind that you
almost like you have to figure out where

344
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:40,740
it is. You gotta go find it
and a song can find it for you.

345
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,030
But like for you just to be able to pull
it out like especially in a fight or

346
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,900
something like that when you battle and
doubt and this and that and you know,

347
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,400
you're how he's doing,

348
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,870
you know, is he okay? Is he tired?
Am I on who's tired or me or him,

349
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,481
you know?

350
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:59,610
And there's that switch in your mind that
if you could just access that all the

351
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,130
time and keep it on.
One of the things,

352
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,680
I think one of the guys I looked up
to when I was in college, you know,

353
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:07,920
he was past Steve Prefontaine as well.
I just store all the time.

354
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,240
It's quotes to do anything. Anything
listening at best is a waste of a gift.

355
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:15,870
You know he ran, he didn't, it
was cross country, but Gosh Trot,

356
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,830
they pacing and everyday
he said I'm running to like
I'm sprinting. You're like,

357
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,950
I watched all his movies, the
movies on him. Cause mindset.

358
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,590
Even at one race when he was
philosopher and they say it's hard,

359
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:27,570
it's going to give.
He gave out right before the finish line.

360
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,130
Like I'd rather go out that way.

361
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,050
Then pacing my whole the whole time it
didn't try to sprint in and fail because

362
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:37,260
I wasn't ready so that's like in
my fight I started off so fast.

363
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,830
That's just I'm going all out.
There's no fill out period.

364
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,770
We're going to touch gloves.

365
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,520
I'm ready to move and I already
know like if I'm getting tired,

366
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,930
I know this guy is getting tired.

367
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,960
He's not trained like I'm training
and if he is training I'm training.

368
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,550
He might not be type of my mind.

369
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:52,950
I'm thinking he's getting tired and just
keep pushing because eventually he's

370
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,900
going to break.
He's going to break before me.

371
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,060
Now do you have a system in terms of
like your strength and conditioning

372
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:03,450
program? Do you, do you have
a schedule that you follow?

373
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:07,830
Like Lex verse specifically for however
many weeks you have before your fight?

374
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,040
When I get in a fight camp, everything
get really specific. Like I said,

375
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,420
Eric on aerial show him, um,
calculating which camp sign.

376
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:20,190
Like don't mess my order. I like, I'll be
early, I had my bags packed night before.

377
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,940
I have three, four training bags packed
at the right at the little edge x way.

378
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,520
So when I come home and I'm sure we're
running short on time, running late,

379
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,650
grab something, eat, grab the
next bag and locked the door.

380
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,960
And I know where I got to go. I hate
when people have to cancer. Like,

381
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,690
oh I can't make it today.
Or if something came up or I show up,

382
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:36,750
my partner don't show up. You're not on
time. I'm like, I'm on. The guy's like,

383
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,580
I'm kind of like the
leader of the big guys.

384
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:41,190
Like we're going to be here earlier this
week so we can start at 10 30 cause I

385
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:43,890
want to do drills after we're going
to do this. You need to work on that.

386
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,940
I'm very punctual. I hate it when
it's camp time of you showing up late.

387
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:51,390
I hate it. It Kinda, it
runs me ragged and I just,

388
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,030
when we spar I kind of take
it out on people. I just,

389
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:58,140
I'm very calculated when it comes to
camp because this is my career. You know,

390
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm serious about this. I'm not showing up
late. Like I go to boxing gyms, we guys,

391
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:06,210
and we've always sparring at six o'clock
so I show up at five 45 or six 45 they

392
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:08,370
still not there when he put
walking like nothing's wrong.

393
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,770
Talking and dance was like,
Yo, you said six o'clock right?

394
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,290
Like you're a professional ain't,
you will quit acting like an amateur.

395
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,810
Get here on time. Let's go. This
is your camp. I'm here to help you.

396
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,630
Even that makes me mad. But
when it's my camp, you show up.

397
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,620
It's not fun because I know I'm not going
to get tired so I'm just going to beat

398
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,300
on me. Who writes out? You're scared.

399
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:26,060
Do you write it out or did
you just know what it is?

400
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,510
Do you have it in your hand or
write it out? You write it down?

401
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,330
Well I put like a notepad and I put how
many weeks now pull it out and I try to

402
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,560
early into it. Like when I first start, I
give it like an ideal what I want to do.

403
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:40,110
So Tuesday, Thursdays during
the conditioning on Monday,

404
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,200
Friday string the conditioning before
Jujitsu, what? Ricardo. And then Tuesday,

405
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,700
Thursday I'm doing one
on ones with Ricardo.

406
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,310
And Wednesday I'm gonna do my one on
one with Nica tone. And then, excuse me,

407
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:50,290
Tuesday night or Monday night,
I'm going to admit some mark.

408
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,030
And then Saturday I have to spar,
I do another Mitt,

409
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,660
tried to two of everything and I go up
to Rutgers and wrestle because in Jersey

410
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:58,630
everything has such a commute. So you
have the time, everything's perfect.

411
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:02,650
Cause if practice goes 15 minutes
pass or whatever or somebody is late,

412
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,070
that's messing me up cause I got to
drive an hour to 45 minutes to get to the

413
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,650
next place and I'm running
late for that practice.

414
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:12,430
Or if it's three practice in the row and
I get there just a little bit right on

415
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:15,640
time. I don't have time to get ready to
do my full warm up to make sure my body's

416
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,820
warm, then get to the next spot under
the same thing. Now I'm rushing.

417
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,280
Nah It's not stopped and I gotta get
home and grab something to eat quick.

418
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,930
I've got to keep my food with me and
it's getting cold and this is like I,

419
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,710
I'm very punctual in specific
when it comes to stuff like that.

420
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,190
Do you meal prep? Do you have like a
little Tupperware containers with food?

421
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,960
Just grab one and I used to use, why
not use, I still use eat clean bro.

422
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,930
When you get into camp, let's use them
all the time. But now like I said,

423
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:44,020
I got to call, I eat clean
bro Clean Bro. It's a Jamie,

424
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:46,930
I can't remember his last name, but Jamie
and New Jersey named, he's killing it,

425
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:51,440
man. He Dj Khaled. Uh,
c'mon. Camella, Anthony La.

426
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,730
All all the famous people use them.
He just opened up another one in Atlanta.

427
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,050
He's killing the game with the meal
prep and he's, it's good. It's accurate.

428
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,370
It wasn't as accurate before they teamed
up with this company revolutionized

429
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,350
which the nutrition coming.

430
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,580
They do the calculation of all the
meals for fighters and different people.

431
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,320
Bodybuilders and it's perfect, but it
has all your nutrients, all your protein.

432
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:16,030
It has it set up like this is 40 grams
of protein and then you can also go in

433
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:17,380
there and just ordered a raw stuff.

434
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,550
They give it dead and they delivered
to your door and then you just cook it.

435
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:23,080
Yeah, you can get it raw and
they'll put it in the freezer bag.

436
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,340
You get it and just put it
in. I know people that do it
that way. Like I said, not.

437
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:29,680
I have my wife who fights and she or he
used to fight and she knows what's going

438
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,820
on. Most of the time she does that for
me. You know, if you bring them venison,

439
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:34,660
will they cook that?

440
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,630
And I know he told me if I get a
Turkey he would cook it up for me.

441
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,080
So I'm sure he'd give me some venison
if I cooked me best and if I took it to

442
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:44,800
him. Now when you say you have
everything set up, um, uh,

443
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:47,110
you monitoring your heart rate,
like what do you,

444
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:50,950
what are you doing to make sure that
you're not overtrained or that's saying

445
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,930
that's one of the thing. I'm still not,
I'm not really dancing with it and my mom,

446
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:57,880
I'm fine with it because growing up my
coach is telling all the time those such

447
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,500
thing over training is a mental state.
You know, as long as you train, eat,

448
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,580
rest, you're giving your body
time to rest and recover,

449
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,380
get to bed by a certain time so you get
at least seven, eight hours of sleep.

450
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,000
It's Kinda hard to overtrain.

451
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,790
But those days where you feel you hurting
like shoulders, like when my injuries,

452
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,670
it's okay to dial back when we go to
the gym. You don't have to hit it hard,

453
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,620
just go through the
motions sometimes like,

454
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:18,850
oh don't be here to go
through the motions.

455
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:22,650
But sometimes it ain't bad to go through
the motions as long as you're focused

456
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,990
on one thing to master,
just take down a master,

457
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,030
this sweep of mass that you just
submission on a sweep or whatever it is,

458
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,360
focus on it and going nice and slow,
calculate.

459
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,150
You don't have to get a sweat every
time cause you learn muscle memory,

460
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,280
do it a thousand times. And now it's Kinda
like it's in there. I got it. But um,

461
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,260
with the overtraining and heart reminder,

462
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,290
I only heart monitor further the last
five to six weeks because that's when I

463
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:49,070
hit cardio heart. Not so much strength
anymore, but pushing the pace,

464
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,490
everything I'm doing blowing out and try
to keep my heart rate above a certain

465
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:55,820
thing. So if the last day before
I go into that, it's pace,

466
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,820
I put the heart rate monitor
on and see wherever I got you.

467
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,390
I don't take much of a break
between my trainers, my stations,

468
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,780
see what my heart rate got. So the high
was one 72 today or whatever. All right.

469
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:09,230
So that's the high on a slow day and
it's hard for me to get my heart rate up.

470
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,520
So it's like when we do doing Carter,

471
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:13,700
I'm shooting for like one eighties after
everything I need to be above that.

472
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,900
So I take time for it to come down.
So in between that 30 to a minute break,

473
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,600
if I'm still right there at one
81 70 so I'm, I hit the next one.

474
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,440
I know my heart is still racing so I'm
stretching my lungs out and take the

475
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:27,290
little short break and I never do
a full minute break even in spawn.

476
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,400
So in fighting,

477
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,340
that's why and that minute you see me
talking to Mark Henry and everything is

478
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:35,150
there like, Oh of course
having a conversation in
between around mark Costes.

479
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:37,850
I'm like, Yep, Yep. Okay, I'm going to
Jujitsu marks and I said, I'm trying,

480
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:42,260
I hear you because that's how we train
and practice on that short clock.

481
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,870
A longer time, work, shorter time,

482
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:48,050
recover am tired and
practice at the beginning.

483
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,860
But at the end is kind of like going
into the fight that last week we talk and

484
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,890
we smile and we chill. It go
round this and this is, you
got to do this. All right,

485
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:57,360
well we got to do better this time
did I had to sweep right there.

486
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:57,881
That's the mission.

487
00:24:57,881 --> 00:25:00,920
What was wrong with my hands and the
next one I work on this again and to be

488
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:04,730
able to communicate and not be tired.
It makes a world of difference.

489
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,310
Do you give yourself 30 seconds
and training? It depends.

490
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,060
Depends on who we fighting.
It depends on my mentality.

491
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,720
You know half I feel like there's going
to be a hard day if we ain't got the

492
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,430
clock.
Sometimes I have it on my phone.

493
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,970
If the coach is not there and my wife
doing it and I stand up and I feel like

494
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:23,500
I'm recovering like 20 minutes or
20 seconds start go. And I was just,

495
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:24,620
we got to keep rotating my partner.

496
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:28,280
So cause I know they can't recover
all the time, but it's just like I'm,

497
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm a little different, you know? It's
like always thinking outside the box. I'm,

498
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,190
I'm trying to do with
the other people aren't,

499
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,360
I mean you know everybody going off like
a dolce diet or the Keto diet or such

500
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:40,760
and such training or west
side barbell or this and that.

501
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,580
That's kind of like I take the different
stuff I learned from this guy and I saw

502
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:44,910
from this guy I learned in wrestling,

503
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,200
I seen on youtube and I heard somebody
say it is like I wonder if I can just

504
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:49,580
take away and take a little bit of this,

505
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,800
put it a little bit with
the west side Barbell,

506
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,220
put it with the Keto Diet along with
my own business and die and this,

507
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,500
this and this and just try it out.
And if it works it works.

508
00:25:57,501 --> 00:26:00,260
And if I don't feel good, I feel low
energy. He's a guy that doesn't work,

509
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,340
I'm going to try something different.

510
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,160
It seems like a lot of people
would want to listen to you though.

511
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:09,170
I was imagining if I was in camp with
a guy like you and I saw the kind of

512
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:12,470
cardio that you have for a big guy and
the amount of effort that you put in.

513
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,950
I would imagine there's other dudes that
are following you now. No, my teammates.

514
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:19,280
Yeah, they know like I'm one of
the guys, my like a brother to me,

515
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:21,120
his car Roverson you seen,
he stepped,

516
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,260
he stepped up on the glorify and that's
something we talked about when he was an

517
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:27,050
amateur. I've been working with us,
they're like amateur and I told his coach,

518
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:30,050
they're like, this kid is good,
he's got the right stuff. He go pro.

519
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,380
He being UFC and no time. You suddenly,
cause he was, I watched him, me,

520
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:35,560
him and Chris Weidman.
He came in with us when I was helping.

521
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,460
Why more to Rockhold fight and I've cut,

522
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,470
I'm not sure if he was
an amateur or pro yet,

523
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,440
but he was hanging his Jujitsu and
her husband, he didn't have that.

524
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,500
But striking was, he was
giving us problems. It was
like this is, this kid is good.

525
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,240
He's a glory kickboxing. Huh. That
makes sense. He kicks hard. I'm like,

526
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:54,900
I haven't seen him put many people just
sleep with his head kick in practice

527
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,510
like Yo pull it. He's like, Bro, that
wasn't even hard. Like what's your mean?

528
00:26:57,511 --> 00:26:58,261
I wasn't hung.
He's like,

529
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:01,860
I just flicked it up there but he's
just so explosive and athletic.

530
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,960
He hit me with a need what?

531
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,990
Last Saturday and my chest steal hurt
cause I got shot and he caught me coming

532
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:11,580
down and shot and I was like, Oh shit.
But I was in deep but he just so quick.

533
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,430
It's just, but like he's one, he hits me
up all the time. Come to camp like Yo,

534
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,130
he has died down because of
bow and clip out of the Pie.

535
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,250
You ended up going to come back to work
and stuff. Should we keep doing this?

536
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:26,340
Should we do this? I'm going to run today.
So when I want to work on my Jujitsu,

537
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,970
what should I do? This I just drill.
Should we go hard? Should I go here?

538
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,210
Sometimes the performance
institute in Vegas.

539
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,070
Well, every time we
get a camp, me and him,

540
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:36,610
we got to think of one of us getting
can't we already know I'm a contact him.

541
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,890
You got to fight when we going to Vegas.
So I go,

542
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,440
we go out there for a week or two weeks,
meet him and Rex Harris,

543
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:45,790
he goes in the pff because other bass
pros, only three dudes at USC and Jersey.

544
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,160
We didn't have traveled around.
We'd been to Vegas.

545
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:52,650
We've been to Arizona or wherever we go
and we go hard and that's why we call it

546
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:56,530
basketball. There's no, oh we going to
light today Bro, don't hit me every time.

547
00:27:56,531 --> 00:27:59,380
It's like, well you ready? You
Ready? Rex actually texted me.

548
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:00,780
We was going to take them
off. He was like, yeah,

549
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,730
I'll be there tomorrow because I'm
flying here and I get back in time for

550
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:06,910
training. So Bass Bros meet
up and we go at it. That's it.

551
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,630
Are you,
are you always sparring hard?

552
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,700
Well, we, we got certain days, like
if we don't want to spoil heart,

553
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:17,080
we know not to go with each other because
it's kind of like if one week I get

554
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:18,090
the best of wrecks,

555
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,090
like there's been times like I had car
off or we're OSP cause he's south and

556
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:24,190
he's super good.
I won't recall three rounds heart.

557
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,710
So his main focus was takedown.
No let them up.

558
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,930
So I take him down and beat him
on the ground, feet on the ground,

559
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,040
take him down and beat him on the ground
cause he didn't have wrestling at the

560
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,700
time. And then he would go
with like somebody else,

561
00:28:33,701 --> 00:28:37,030
like I need one more around
and he'd be mad. I know that,

562
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,390
but that's why I'm not
going home on the fourth,

563
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,380
fourth round cause he's mad and he'd go
out there with somebody else and just,

564
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:44,740
you just eat him up and she's like,
I'm sorry, I have to apologize.

565
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,680
The other guy like, I'm sorry if I'm
beating him up because the hostility.

566
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:50,470
So we go hard, but there's times we
pulled other guys and you're like,

567
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:54,310
I'm gonna call this amateur guy in pretty
good amateur or a low level pro pro.

568
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,920
Some guys that Eddie Alvarez
knows whenever I got this kid,

569
00:28:56,921 --> 00:29:00,490
he's pro two oh five he's the beginner.
Whatever you want to work with him,

570
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,550
that's the guy. I bring them up today.
I'm gonna do a technical move day,

571
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,120
kind of like wall work,
drilling, we sparring.

572
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,350
We have had your own just in
case cause accidents happen.

573
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:11,050
But nothing is strong with
intention to hurt anybody.

574
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,520
What'd you have a fantastic camp too,
man.

575
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,540
It was one of the most unheralded camps.

576
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:19,410
If you want to talk about who's training
out there that beat you guys have

577
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,000
Marlin,
you know,

578
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,960
of course Frankie Edgar means so
many guys come from that area.

579
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,220
Eddie Alvarez,

580
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,280
you and I mean it's just mark Henry's
one of the most underappreciated guys in

581
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:36,690
MMA I think because he's so quiet and
unassuming. Doesn't toot his own horn.

582
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,990
But when you talk to that guy, you see
the wheel spin and you're like, wow,

583
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,090
he something serious.
And everybody I know that's worked

584
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,020
with them and said he's like one of
the best coaches I've ever, ever seen.

585
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,800
Nothing like it. I remember the
first time I went, he broke it down.

586
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,780
I remember he was telling
me movement on his show.

587
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:52,750
He broke me down a little bit like we're
going to work like they'll punch slide

588
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:56,860
out, slide back, slide clinch, different
stuff, staying out of punching range.

589
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,550
He brought me down very lightly for six
weeks and like I fell in love with it

590
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,730
there. Is that the first time you worked
as far as you asked him to this day when

591
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:07,230
wisdom the back, the first fight to get
in the house and I was the last fight.

592
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,020
I told my coach I like to warm early
isn't so I want to start warming up before

593
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:12,430
the first fight just
to get my heart going.

594
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:15,490
It was the rest of the thing go heart
and he just chilled so time and I,

595
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:18,510
when I was going here like have you ever
done this before? I had no background,

596
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,770
anything, just a restaurant. I could
throw a one tooth. That was it.

597
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,360
And he was like,
I'm going to show you this.

598
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,310
And he kept telling me to do it
and I was listening like, Bro,

599
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:26,830
you're listen so well. Like one of
the wrestling, you have to listen.

600
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:28,840
And that's when me and
Mark Click from that day,

601
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,050
and I remember when they flipped
a coin and it came off Freaky,

602
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:34,760
seen Frankie get the first pick.
I remember hearing marketing back court,

603
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,680
we won't core, he listens.
He's a writer and be a mark,

604
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:39,970
have been like this since
and we have that bond.

605
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,270
But I remember coming the first day
of the House I got the Jersey is,

606
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,940
that's how I got there. Mark was the
one, it takes me Frankie route say,

607
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:48,220
oh come on Ricardo.
I met everybody together.

608
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,280
But mark was the one that was more hands
on texting me while I was back home

609
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:53,170
with the family work.
This work that work,

610
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:54,940
this work that go to roof for
sport and work your kicks.

611
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:56,710
We need to have the kicks.
Good. By the time we get here.

612
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,080
And it was in the basement.
It's like, all right,

613
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:03,220
so you see like this whole piece of
paper, like all the way down, like coats,

614
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,710
everybody's Co's wrote on that
paper and what does that, he's like,

615
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:09,190
oh that's the combos. Like that's like a
hundred combos. Like oh hey we got co's.

616
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,940
Like nobody ever knows this.
It only changes the code
for each fight, right? Yeah.

617
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,000
And I'm like, what is that? And you
see my papers just blink cause the guy,

618
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,460
so this is just schedule. He had me
on the first code, it's just schedule.

619
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,780
And that was pat like 13 weeks
of nonstop going. It's like,

620
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,090
and this is what we're going
to work for your coast.

621
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,110
So today we're going
to start with the Jab,

622
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:30,160
cross ski to codes for that and movement
about three rounds. And I was like, Yo,

623
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,820
like I'm flat footed. I couldn't
move. Like I can't do this. He's like,

624
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:35,680
you could do it.
It's like a tandem dance.

625
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,380
And we joined a dance team and the
first day we learned this new routine.

626
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:40,240
We're going to be all over with
tripping each other every day.

627
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,250
And the next day we get a
little better in a week.

628
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,770
We got to kind of like the first,
the first course we got it.

629
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,710
By the end of the time it was time to
perform. We're going to look beautiful,

630
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,500
I promise you. And sure enough he, he uh,

631
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,930
I found he had a piece of your
like I want to slice a pizza.

632
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:55,420
It's like I want you to learn how to
move. He's like, you learn how to move.

633
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,270
I'll give you a slice of my pieces.
He said, when you can move out,

634
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:01,150
bring you a slice of pizza. I heard
he's got some killer ps pretty good.

635
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:05,480
I think like it was a week 10 before
the fight I had 13 we can't like you,

636
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,900
you actually moved a little bit.
I told my wife to bring you on slides.

637
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,060
It was slides like I got his approval
and ever since then like it's just been a

638
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:17,890
thing that movement his, his scientific
ways. Yeah. Like I've seen Chris,

639
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:19,720
why I'm and do it.
Rashad Evans,

640
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:23,860
we got Lance Palmer and
Claudia now different people
like watching and trying to

641
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:27,430
learn. You can just see, oh, last is out
there too now. He just came out recently.

642
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,910
He was last week when I, before I
left, he showed us out there. Who Will?

643
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,340
Claudia [inaudible].

644
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,860
She had a gym out there and she's been
at our gym working and when mark was like

645
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:39,110
helping him after sparring last Thursday
and he called me in the case like Corey,

646
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,010
he's really good to

647
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,350
show them how we do the the one,
two blah blah blah.

648
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,560
And like when I look back and they both
had that look at each other like, uh,

649
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,500
that was a lot of shit. But you
figure it out in time when it's new.

650
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,840
Anything new you,
it's going to be uncomfortable.

651
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,320
But after you figure it out and you
do it for so much, it's muscle memory.

652
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,310
So when you were fighting as
a heavyweight, you weren't
a mover. I mean what?

653
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:02,960
I thought it was moving,
I wasn't moving,

654
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:05,810
but for heavyweight it was just kind of
like a little bounce bounce my knees.

655
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:07,370
If they go to step forward,
when I go to a punch,

656
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,020
hop out and then come back
with a jab to a AA. Right.

657
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,370
That's what I had to meander chair.
That was movement. I was the man,

658
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:16,970
I'm moving my ass off.
No, that was nothing.

659
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:20,020
You get the mark and it's kind of
like feet on your toe spot a spot.

660
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,400
Don't ever stop when you stop me. He be
like 10 times like that's what happened.

661
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:23,030
We stopped.

662
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,640
It's really interesting when you watch
the difference between the way people

663
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:28,610
utilize footwork. I think probably
the best example and combat,

664
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,560
well there's two great
examples in combat sports.

665
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:35,240
Lama Chanko who has got some of the
most incredible footwork of all time and

666
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:39,380
Sanchez who, who's a toy town,
who's got crazy foot work,

667
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,260
constantly switching stances,
light on his toes,

668
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:46,250
fights different than any other tie
fighter and widely considered the best of

669
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,290
all time, you know, and Loma Chanko.

670
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,950
Like when you watch guys who
have good footwork fight him.

671
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,510
They like what in the fuck?

672
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:57,280
Like you throw a punch and he's over
here and he's hitting you here and upper

673
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:58,820
cuts coming under your armies.

674
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,480
He's back this way and he's like
the matrix constantly moving.

675
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:06,170
And that guy started out as a dancer.
His Dad when he was,

676
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,880
his dad was training him out of box.

677
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,060
He made him do Russian folk dancing I
think I want to say for like four years.

678
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:19,190
He made him do this, this kind of
Russian style of dancing. He was like,

679
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:19,620
you got to,

680
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,560
you're going to have to learn how to
move your feet and now you see him.

681
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,870
He fights.
It's effortless.

682
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,100
It's just a part of who he is and guys
who are like more plotting and they're

683
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,260
used to that normal stationary target.

684
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,300
He's so much more complex and you see
any obviously fantastic punch or two,

685
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,870
but the footwork is off the charts.
It's just such a different thing.

686
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,730
There's levels to everything.

687
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,410
And you I guess realize that when you
went from heavyweight to train with mark

688
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:50,290
mark yet, but like when we
said the footwork thing,
one thing I seen uh, an MMA,

689
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,140
the Holloway or Tigger fight.
Yeah,

690
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,760
I feel like it in my mind I felt like
I was watching and lemon, chicken, MMA,

691
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,800
how Holloway was like hidden angles
because Brian isn't like a mover type.

692
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,780
He just, he's biting down, he's gritty,

693
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:05,690
he's ready to go and it seemed
like as the round like third,

694
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:07,610
fourth and fifth or
third and fourth round.

695
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,290
Like when he would go to punch
macro switched South Paul. Yup.

696
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:14,210
I'll hop out and when he go to Kauai and
go back with the hook this way and it

697
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:16,760
was just like, Yo, his
footwork right now is like,

698
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:19,460
I watched probably like seven times.
It's studying his feet. Like how was,

699
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:23,750
he ain't never lost balance. One time
it was like this is just incredible.

700
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:25,860
I love watching it.
Like it's a dance.

701
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,140
It's beauty now max is very good
at distinct distance control.

702
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,500
He's one of the very best at just
moving slightly out of range.

703
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:36,740
Then right back in and he puts a lot
of pressure on you because of the two.

704
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:37,980
There's no,
if he catches you

705
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,790
breathing heavy and he kept his,
if he sees any slowing down in you,

706
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:45,750
he starts pouring it on like you started
to try and get you to wilt. He sees it.

707
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,350
It's very, very interesting how he
does it too because he does it with,

708
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,150
he overloads you not just with his attack
but also with all the variables that

709
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:56,220
you see.
The combinations of switching,

710
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,940
the putting pressure on
you just as there's so much
going on that you're always

711
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:03,270
thinking about it and it's does that
on top of it makes you more tired.

712
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,200
He's good at smelling the
blood. Yeah, he's good. He
knows a lot of people. I know.

713
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:10,390
That's one thing I'm not good at.
I'm working on,

714
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,800
mark was telling me other day like I want
to start finish people with the hands.

715
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,340
Like you had so many
places where you couldn't,

716
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,700
but you hit a guy with a common or
you take a shot like the Gavi. Right.

717
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,640
You just don't see it and instead
of key punching him, you as shoot,

718
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,170
he stopped punching your chute on him.

719
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,350
It's like I hit guy the combos and like
when I go to the boss and you're like,

720
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,010
Bro,

721
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,420
you box like you a boxer but you're going
to be a fight and you box just to get

722
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,740
you your take downs. But
that's because I'm a wrestler.
I can box. I don't have to,

723
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:35,574
but I will.

724
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,780
Do you think there's a worry though when
you're trying to finish fights versus

725
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,310
just trying to fight your best?

726
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,140
I think guys should just fight their
best and if the finished comes, it comes.

727
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,300
I'm of the opinion that I'm of the opinion
that when people make big mistakes,

728
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:55,140
and I wouldn't discourage anybody from
going crazy if someone likes to go crazy,

729
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:58,140
they like to fight wild. Hey man,
that's you. That's your style.

730
00:36:58,141 --> 00:36:59,940
That's how you express yourself.
Nothing wrong with it.

731
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,790
But if I was going to give some advice
and they said, what should I do?

732
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,540
I want to have a long career as a
professional. Let's say fight your best.

733
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,150
Don't worry about the outcome.
Just fight your best.

734
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,480
And if you fight your
best and if you connected,

735
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:15,060
someone gets hurt and you put them
away, that's great. But if you just win,

736
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,150
that's great to just fight your best.
The more,

737
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,180
the more you can do what you can
technically and take as little damage as

738
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:27,120
possible. That's a good fight. And this,

739
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,420
that's almost the OSP fight.
Mark said it like you just got to,

740
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,720
has got whole camp.

741
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,930
He's got that good kit and then the Osp
Fi and Gian volante the two fights and

742
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,650
mark called the only thing that I can
get knocked out way. He said, well Gee,

743
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,380
I'm blind to it. The only thing that's
gonna knock you out, what is overhead,

744
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,350
right?
He says,

745
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:48,590
you got to bring that jab right back
after he got a good job of bringing your

746
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:50,450
hands back. Cause he's
times that overhand. Right?

747
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,660
So smooth and even in between rounds
like you, you know where I am, right?

748
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,750
I know it's not hurting you but only takes
one. It takes one. Keep that hand up.

749
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:59,540
Keep that hand up.
And sure enough till this day he say,

750
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,630
remember I told you overhand,
right? And then with Osp is like,

751
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,410
only thing I can get you is that, hey,
that left kick. If you stay close to him,

752
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,260
keep the pressure, keep them on
occasion when he's down, he stand up,

753
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:11,030
bring them back down.
Don't listen to the fans.

754
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:13,400
People are going to get to your
head and make you want to strike.

755
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:15,440
Trying to get in that fight.
That's what they want to see.

756
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,460
But we just try and get the win.
Don't go right and keep pressure,

757
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,090
not go right and keep pressure.
If you watched that fight,

758
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:26,180
the whole two rounds pressure
and not going right, going left,

759
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,760
put them to the case, taking him down,
keep them down in the KT, stand up,

760
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,770
bring them back. Third round, I took him
down, he Pato and I was against the case.

761
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,100
I can remember her if he was say,
oh,

762
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,330
they'll stand up and and stand up and
fight and I backed away for a second,

763
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,520
started moving like, God, I'm going
to play from the outside a little bit.

764
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,710
And I went right. Trying to the
Hickey and I was like, when I came,

765
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:48,550
first thing mark said in the bay, I bro,
you look phenomenal. You just went right,

766
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,140
like you look great. You just went
right. Everything was beautiful. A fight.

767
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:56,070
That was your breakthrough
fight. You, you just went right,

768
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:58,090
but we're going to go back. You
going to do better. I know you will.

769
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,600
And now it's just like after that I
guess I went to John boy was like,

770
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,370
fuck what the fans say we've went in.
But like you said, when you and Shabazz,

771
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,250
when I listened to before and you
say I'd be little chief, I beat this,

772
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,070
but you don't hear my name is because
I'm not trying to do this stuff that's

773
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:15,280
exciting anymore. I'm just winning
and my style and exciting to them.

774
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:17,260
But that's because you're
not a mixed martial arts fan.

775
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,200
You're a fan of a knockout or
you're a fan of some fancy stuff.

776
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,120
They talk in Johnny Walker up.
This isn't this.

777
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,430
Johnny Walker hasn't shown
mixed martial arts shit.

778
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:28,300
He's shown it fancy stuff that not
people out. It looks great. Yes,

779
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,400
but just like Anthony
Smith and all those guys,

780
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,520
when they get in front of somebody like
John Jones and you can't hit him with

781
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:37,540
that one punch, what are you
going to do? You know what I mean?

782
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,810
So that's thing I'll say right
now. I'm not fighting. He said,

783
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,730
when are you going to fight?
I don't know,

784
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,590
but I'll be ready cause
I can do everything.

785
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,420
Yeah, we were just talking about Johnnie
Walker. He's in surgery now. Who are,

786
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,760
he had to go through surgery for show.
Showed that that celebration,

787
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,130
that celebration was just so crazy.
He wins.

788
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:56,220
He beat beat circa runoff
with a beautiful time knee.

789
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,320
Perfect flying knee looks fantastic and
then drops to the ground just playing

790
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:04,650
around and blows his fucking shoulder out.
It's crazy.

791
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,670
That's the game or anything can happen.
And then when it was 10 injury,

792
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,770
what happens like that? It's like God
damn man, you're so promising. Um, he's a,

793
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,760
he's a mean. What, what gets people
excited when people finish fights, right?

794
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,100
People Kao People. And so a lot of
times people try to lean towards that.

795
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,650
But if that's not your style,
you know you should,

796
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,170
you should fight the way your
f if I was in your corner,

797
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,320
first of all I'd say listen to Mark Henry,
Mark Henry knows everything.

798
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,990
And then second of all,
I would say don't change shit man.

799
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:37,110
What you're doing is perfect.
Just just fight the way you're fighting,

800
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,760
the way you're fighting is just you
winning. You know you're, you're,

801
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,400
I just think that it should be what it
should be emphasized always to fight the

802
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:49,351
best.

803
00:40:49,351 --> 00:40:53,820
You can fight intelligently and you got
to decide and everybody has to decide

804
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:56,910
when is it time to take a risk,
when is it time to close the distance?

805
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,210
When is it time to put
pressure on someone and,

806
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,680
and throw yourself into the
fire to try to get a finish.

807
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,800
And if you just think you should
just fight technically, look man,

808
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:07,590
fucking Floyd Mayweather has
done that most of his career,

809
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,950
especially like later on when he was
pretty boy Floyd earlier on his career.

810
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:12,330
He's trying to knock a lot of guys out.

811
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:17,070
But later on in his career and most of
his big fights like with Pacquiao and a

812
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:19,470
lot of the guys,
he just wins.

813
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,530
He just wins and it makes more
money than anybody just wins.

814
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,080
Interesting. Um, and my mind,
I know exactly, I'll tell
you when I get in this bar,

815
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,570
no spelling is not want to work on things.
You know every,

816
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,500
every Saturday going to spot me and my
wife's Josh like what are you on today

817
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,730
we're going to try to work on,

818
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:37,790
put a little more emphasis on the punches
and not shoot right away and blah blah

819
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,880
blah on the ground.
More ground and pound on.

820
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,930
Worry about did just Jujitsu submission.
Just hit this, this and this.

821
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,190
When it's come time to fight,

822
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,490
when the lights come on Saturday night
and Joe are Bruce buffer in there and you

823
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:49,310
sit down the side, it's a whole different
game plan. I know what I can do.

824
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:52,920
I know what's right and that's why I get
into those spots and like I tell myself,

825
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,010
take a shot. It's muscle
memory. When I hit him,

826
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:57,430
he put his hands up and he stopped
the legs wide open course. Oh,

827
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:02,120
the NCAA all American, uh, NCAA finalist.
Why we're not, shoot, I'd take them down.

828
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,550
Exactly. And if he's looking
at my last three fights,

829
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,010
I feel like going back and watching them,
those,

830
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:10,910
you can't say I'm one side because
at lear everybody will know way.

831
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:13,370
He can rest with lear. Lear is way
more powerful and better. Russell,

832
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,180
he works with photo. Uh, whatever
worries from Albanian world team.

833
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,320
He couldn't take me down
and I'll struggle. You know,
you went to glove like, oh,

834
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,820
glow over to finish. You've just,
who got core goes to ground him.

835
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,790
It's over and he can not Cory out.
I was struggling.

836
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,170
I'll rest of them and got them in mount
and had him Seigel. I had him, his head,

837
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:33,290
his back. I had every position on him.
So you can't say I don't have Jujitsu,

838
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:36,320
I don't have restaurant,
don't have striking cause
near and impact comes there.

839
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,750
But like, oh, he was an
Ncaa d one. All American.

840
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:43,670
This isness he beat DC at OTC. He had
beaks on a kill Korean restaurant. Stop.

841
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:47,180
Just take down and set the record with
13 takedowns on him who had the record at

842
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:51,140
11 it's like I don't understand the fans.
Everybody got something to say,

843
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:55,430
but if you listen to people too much,
Cari, my wife said all the time,

844
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:59,470
like every morning like no
negativity today. Fuck off line.

845
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,740
That's what you should do.

846
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,160
Cause I'm doing a hunting
stuff and I'll pose this stuff.

847
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,220
It's like as I'm going to put
it, it pops on my pop up. Yeah.

848
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,100
Or at the top of the screen it had dropped
down or pop up in the notification or

849
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:16,820
I get an email notification. Somebody
say, hey, you see half of it.

850
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,860
I like the open door that
I drive and I want her.

851
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,730
The rest of us say it
could be a good thing.

852
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,500
It might be bad and actually open it up
later on if somebody saying something bad

853
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,030
like my wife just said, she's like, I see
it. Just don't pay no attention to it.

854
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:32,850
Yeah,

855
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:36,770
you're, you're allowing negativity
into life that you don't need. I mean,

856
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:39,410
you think about your camp,
you got all these positive people,

857
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:43,130
all these motivated people, all
these professionals, you know,

858
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:44,690
exceptional human beings,
right?

859
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:48,050
Everybody training and grind together
and then you got schmoes that are

860
00:43:48,051 --> 00:43:52,310
contacting you on Twitter or Instagram
or whatever and just saying a bunch of

861
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:55,010
nonsense and that could fuck
with your head. You know?

862
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,220
And these are not people that would ever
say that if they were in front of your

863
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:02,720
face. It's a gross way to communicate.
It's just, it's not a hell. It's like,

864
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,880
it's like passing by a shitty fast food
restaurant being drawn in to eat and

865
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:10,550
then you eat and you're like,
God, why did he take the garbage?

866
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:14,540
It's the same thing. It's
like you're eating, it's like
fast food for your brain.

867
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,870
It's, it's so tempting because you
just want to read those comments.

868
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:22,790
And most of the people are probably
good people who are fans, most of them.

869
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,160
But all it takes is 10% assholes.

870
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,140
And you never want to look
at your comments again.

871
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:31,980
One out of 10 and this is not hard to
get 10% and 10% assholes. It's like

872
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,900
pretty damn good in the real world.
You know,

873
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:38,220
if you only run into one out of 10
that's an asshole or one out of a hundred

874
00:44:38,221 --> 00:44:40,470
even if it was one out of a hundred
and your comments have shitty,

875
00:44:40,471 --> 00:44:43,500
you don't want to read those comments.
It's just for a fighter man.

876
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,680
It's so much of it is about mindset and
just being focused and not having any

877
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:52,800
distractions. And I think those comments
are a giant distraction. You know,

878
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:55,650
you don't need anybody telling you what
to teach you how to mark fucking Henry

879
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,730
you. You've got Ricardo Elmeda, you've
got all these world champions around you,

880
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:02,370
like you don't need any,
any other information.

881
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:05,430
You're getting plenty of information,
you know, fuck all that shit.

882
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:08,820
You shouldn't even look at it.
You should post and just run away.

883
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,620
Just post something and don't even
look out. Keep going. Just keep going.

884
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,180
Just you got to work it.

885
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,970
I know I've got to work on it
because what you're saying right now,

886
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:22,010
all of the things you were saying about
beating Glover about beating a clearly

887
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,800
TFA yet, but you're saying it
like you're arguing with somebody.

888
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,080
You're saying like,
someone told you you can't do it,

889
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:30,720
but who gives a fuck what
they said you did do it.

890
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,110
So why argue with someone who clearly
doesn't know what the fuck they're talking

891
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:37,080
about anyway, right. But in
your head and you're like,

892
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:40,950
they said I couldn't do this. They
like, see you still have that. It's,

893
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:44,910
he know what I'm talking about.
That battle hundred percent good mark.

894
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,800
And they tell me all the time
like, Bro, quick feed, like
don't, don't even read it.

895
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,730
I come from smart,
me and my brother,

896
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:52,890
we always had that mentality like people
were like, we're talking to, isn't this?

897
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,440
Yeah, we weren't as active. We ain't going
to sit there and talk back and forth.

898
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:58,940
It was like my first responding to
anybody. He's talking shit like, Hey,

899
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:03,450
put your hands up. I'm ready to
fight. I'm gonna prove you wrong.

900
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,150
That's all my time. Like they always
say it, Corey couldn't do this.

901
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,800
You will do that. You when did this my
whole life like in college, like court,

902
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,150
you're not going to go to Midlands.

903
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,730
We only take five guys on the teen and
young guarantee coaching going to take

904
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:17,460
you where the two years I was there I was
the guy that went to the middle of the

905
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:20,370
first pick every time like I'm always
shooting to prove somebody wrong.

906
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,060
Do you feel like that's a
part of your motivation? Yes.
It's always been that way.

907
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,990
But you're also,

908
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:28,140
your motivation is obviously excellent
so there's no way it could just be to

909
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:31,620
prove someone wrong as hard as you
work. No, but that's just, let's put it,

910
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,100
that's how I got to the mentality
and the work ethic I guess.

911
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,210
Cause in high school I wasn't like this.
I sucked in high school I lost way.

912
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,150
I didn't win a match.
I was sophomore in high school.

913
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,620
I'm a wrestler since third grade.

914
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,900
Like I was asked tastic and
horrible like why got beat one time?

915
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:50,820
And the coach left me out.
They left,

916
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,450
they load the bus and left
me sitting there because you
got beat the way. Upbeat.

917
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,370
Yes. They didn't want to bring you
home. It wasn't, I got beat through.

918
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:01,710
I got dropped off. So a girl, Joe.
Ooh, you lost to a girl. Dead Ass.

919
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:04,320
I didn't have the mental,
I logged up when I got out the Mat,

920
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,290
the team was gone when outside the bus
was going on. The reason I got home,

921
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,570
because the varsity came for it,
do it at night. And he was like,

922
00:47:09,571 --> 00:47:13,080
why are you still here?
Wow. That's fucked up. Yeah.

923
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,770
That's something ruthless
coach. But that's the thing.
I wasn't, I was that boy,

924
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,410
like he got the little boy
that cried wolf. You know,

925
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,860
I was always trying to get
out of workouts. I was fat.
I was lazy at the time.

926
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:26,510
Growing up, I loved outdoors. I love video
games and I love eating junk. You know,

927
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,250
I didn't always have this mindset. So when
it came to a point I wanted to do good

928
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,900
and I was trying and took my first injury.

929
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,110
I very first injury sophomore year in
high school before Congress I snapped my

930
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:38,590
ankle cleanser and I remember
everybody when I was in a hurt,

931
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,260
first time I was actually hurting,
but I have fixed so many injuries.

932
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,440
Even a coach came up with
like, cool, y'all was faking.

933
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:45,550
Everybody's wearing run sprints.

934
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:49,600
You get up because they all thought I
was faking but I was actually hurt and my

935
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:50,330
buddy stopped by,

936
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,540
he grabbed me and took me to his trainer
in to train is like when I was probably

937
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,700
a spring here, be fine. Once the dog,

938
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:56,290
my dad came and got me and
winter he did an x Ray,

939
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,960
I'm up there was like this much
bone holding my foot from Pharma.

940
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,370
They like ain't cool is like pretty
much I why know nobody bring you in.

941
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:04,880
Like they kept saying it was nothing
wrong and I went back to the x.

942
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,310
It was all like, oh bro, I'm so sorry.

943
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:10,480
Like you have been like for so
long and residents third grade,

944
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:13,240
you know I did it because my brother
did it and I went do everything he did,

945
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:15,790
but I didn't, I didn't have the
drive he had. But after that scene,

946
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:17,280
the way everybody kind of like dog me out,

947
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:20,920
I remember coming back from recovery
from that and the first time I ran after

948
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,800
injury and even in my mind like I
can't run this, I can't really get,

949
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,260
and I did and I was limping.
I was scared it was gonna break again.

950
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,380
But I made it to where I was going.
Like Brock and dude, this is just,

951
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,280
it's all here now. That's my
real, everything goes mentality.

952
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,040
Like I never had any problems. I was
just lazy. I didn't want to work.

953
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,910
So I was finding a way out. Now that
the next year you can ask the coaches,

954
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:42,260
they told my parents I got moved up
to the varsity tournament the first or

955
00:48:42,261 --> 00:48:45,350
second match and I catch the second and
third and the varsity tournament after

956
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,060
wrestling Jv for the year before. And
I lost the guy that, one of the things,

957
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,120
there's a difference between core now is
night and day is because I realized if

958
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:55,300
I put my mind to it and just work,
quit wearing my dad said it too.

959
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:57,880
That's the thing my dad puts it on.
So you're at such a young age.

960
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,100
My brother got it.
He was a star athlete,

961
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,270
but he didn't get the openings in
the opportunities I had. You know,

962
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:06,610
cause he's always working for my
father and working here, working there.

963
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,580
He didn't have the time to do camps
and all that. Me being the youngest,

964
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:12,460
it was a little easier for me.
I seen when he did what he told me,

965
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,181
when my brothers,

966
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:15,850
my sisters and teammates and all the
different different people around me had

967
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:20,770
done. I knew the way I needed to go to
get somewhere. But being a star athlete,

968
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,980
a professional athlete, it was never a
goal of mine. I wanted to be engineered.

969
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,340
I love building club houses and Shit
like that. That was what I wanted to do.

970
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,520
But all of that open doors. I wanted to
go to school to University of Wisconsin,

971
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,260
Platteville for an engineer program,
but just like sports, my grazers ass,

972
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:35,990
I didn't see,

973
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:38,860
I didn't try and so I went there to
hang out with my friends and be cool.

974
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:41,680
You know what I mean? When I applied,
they messaged me back saying,

975
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:43,780
your GPA isn't good enough.
The restaurant culture on the media.

976
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,480
Because by then I was good at wrestling.
My last few years I killed it.

977
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,210
I never made the state,
but I killed in the regional and sections.

978
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:51,430
I will all of the sections and
lost in the finals. He had to go,

979
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,330
you have to when they're a third whatever.
But um, and it says you can't get here,

980
00:49:55,331 --> 00:49:59,230
but you got to go to junior college. You
get your GPA up, we can get you in again.

981
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:02,170
I went there. I didn't plan on
wrestling anymore. I loved wrestling.

982
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,490
I cry when it was over. But then, um, the
Guy Dave Clem, man, he uses old coach.

983
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:09,760
That's how I met Matt Hughes to Lincoln
College. He reached out to me. I was like,

984
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:13,270
I heard about you. You got the mentality
of a like you work hard, your workhorse.

985
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,340
I need somebody like you to
come here and work for me.

986
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,070
I can't get a scholarship because you
didn't do much. I don't have money left.

987
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,060
I gave you 1800 bucks. It was 27,000 I
thought it was like a full ride. I'm like,

988
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,130
Oh Sean, get money. And
I went, they're excited,

989
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,990
determined to get there and
everybody like, Oh yeah,

990
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,150
you know we made a state not going to
do good. This isn't this. So again,

991
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,700
that was motivation from right there going
to school like they don't think I can

992
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:33,350
do this date on.
My grades aren't good enough.

993
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,810
They don't think I can get education.
I'm not good enough for sports.

994
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:36,830
I don't think I'm all American.

995
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:40,310
I think I'm gonna go down and just be
another member of the team. I went there,

996
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,610
I cut up but row for a season
snapped my leg in three.

997
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,510
I thought it was over again.
And that coaches,

998
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,900
like I saw you fire a different
leg injury at the same,

999
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:50,690
the same leg with different
injury for like three years later.

1000
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,500
You're back to the first one that
injuries. What changed you? Well,

1001
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:56,090
I got tired of people was
thinking I was faking.

1002
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,250
So because you were injured for real
in people thought you were faking it,

1003
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,510
you realize something was wrong.

1004
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:06,110
I feel that I realized I have been
lazy and my father and my whole life.

1005
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,900
You go to my old house right now in
the garage. It's steel carved in there.

1006
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,230
I never get day. It was probably like
eight o'clock nine o'clock school night.

1007
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:15,680
My Dad woke me and my brother to help
him do some stuff on a boat. We tired,

1008
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,720
you know, we want to go back and we out
there complaining the whole time. He says,

1009
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,520
my dad, if you've met my dad is
the most motivating person ever.

1010
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,060
Don't have an education. None. But he,

1011
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:26,570
he started his own business
from the ground up and he's
living the dream hunting

1012
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:29,240
properties for everyone. He can do
it and that's where I got it from.

1013
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,320
But it took me forever to realize this
and I'll never forget the day says it

1014
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:34,490
comes to me all the time.
I think about,

1015
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,070
he stood up on the boat and was up
against the garage door, brand new garage.

1016
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:40,610
So he just put up, you know, one
thing I hate, I cannot stand is lazy.

1017
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:43,280
And he took his drill,
he cut l a Z,

1018
00:51:43,281 --> 00:51:46,880
y and the back of his brand new garage
and it's still there till this day I go

1019
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:47,661
home and I visited.

1020
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:51,500
I go there and you'll see it cut in
and do it lazy and he cannot stand it.

1021
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:53,210
And if you know him the way he works,

1022
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,500
he's just turned 59 Tuesday and I could
and his voice and I said, you had a job.

1023
00:51:57,501 --> 00:52:01,070
So I don't know. Oh He's, they
are working. He got a bunch
of 20 year olds, 30 year.

1024
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,860
He outworks everybody 59
years of up and down a ladder.

1025
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,800
Brian Crane driving the truck
to the shot and that's it.

1026
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,260
He always said when I was a kid saying,
can only last so long.

1027
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:12,080
I never understood what he said. He used
to come up to me on the football field.

1028
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:15,980
I'd be crying and moping around. It can
only last so long so can keep going.

1029
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:19,280
I can only last so long. I said like,
what do you mean? Why you always say that?

1030
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,770
And then later on it started getting hard.

1031
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,990
I started thinking like practice
going and looking at the clock.

1032
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,680
It's like 45 minutes but can only last
so long and it clicked like, oh shit.

1033
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:32,810
That's what my dad meant all these years
it can only last so long line. Just go,

1034
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:37,430
just go. Just put your nose. I get to,
so you have this injury sophomore year,

1035
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,930
your ankle snaps and you realize
that you've been lazy. So what?

1036
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,400
What shifted in your mind? What
did, how did you change it?

1037
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:50,040
Just stop worrying about excuses to get
out of practice and the first graduate

1038
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,780
as I was healing,
I was on bedrest for awhile.

1039
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,580
It was so bad and people come in out and
my brother used to come over at a time

1040
00:52:58,581 --> 00:53:01,340
he was playing football and
whatever and watching his games.

1041
00:53:01,341 --> 00:53:04,220
It's just like sitting there for so long
away from all the sports and all your

1042
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:08,530
friends and just sitting there just
yourself. And I just realized like I can,

1043
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,720
I've been doing it since third grade.
I've seen this stuff a million times.

1044
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,170
I know the moves, I just don't
apply. I think when I get back,

1045
00:53:15,171 --> 00:53:19,230
if I actually start trying and drilling
and actually practicing and getting that

1046
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:24,200
extra workout in, I could cut it up
and sure enough, that's what happened.

1047
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:27,860
So what was the first step?
When I came back, it was weird.

1048
00:53:27,861 --> 00:53:29,430
At first run I was living at,

1049
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:32,970
my dad's shop is probably 200 yards from
my house and it was raining and that's

1050
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:35,790
all I, that's one reason why
I ran, because I didn't want
to get away. I was like,

1051
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:38,310
I'm about to run through the house. And
I'm thinking like, but here's the thing,

1052
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,040
I don't know if I can make, and they're
right in that doubt in my mind, like,

1053
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:44,560
why are you telling some of you? Can
you make it? How many from the injuries?

1054
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:48,930
What broke it in what January or December.

1055
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,950
And this was summertime, so it was a lot
like I had the cast on for like five,

1056
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:57,110
six months. So yeah, I went to Arab. Ooh.
It was like, it was five, six months.

1057
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,150
It was bad. And then I, right now I've
got the plate and the screws in the end,

1058
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:03,180
but I broke some of the screws because
I was like trying to move in a wrestling

1059
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:05,280
stance in my boot and I slipped.

1060
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,240
My Dad had to tile or just submit and
he had a little gloss over it and I was

1061
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:12,570
washing the cars one day and then I was
like, oh, just going to and my shadows to,

1062
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:15,330
I don't know what, I slipped on a
wet spot and I slipped. I felt it.

1063
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,120
And the two are the pins that
go across my ankle, his snap.

1064
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,960
So I had to wait for all that
to heal again. Jesus Christ.
It was a whole process.

1065
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:23,880
So I was late snap the two.

1066
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:26,730
I still got the two long screw that they
take out the leave to seven and go up

1067
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:30,270
the femur or the Tibia. But the too
long was it supposed to pull out,

1068
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,950
but the middle and I slit,

1069
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,050
they've broken half of my bones so that
made the bone heal slower cause now it

1070
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,470
was just a little spot
they drilled through.

1071
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,900
It opened up like that
much that much more.

1072
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,210
So he had to wait for all that to
heal before I could actually walk.

1073
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:44,190
They take the screws out and
putting new ones in there.

1074
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,890
So you got broken screws in your,

1075
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:48,240
and if you look at like when I work
out I got my barrio ankles fat as hell.

1076
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,150
That's because of the plate, the plate
and the screws. The screws are so long.

1077
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,610
The ankle bone, the swelling and
there's different, exactly the angle.

1078
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,390
Which ankle?
That's a fat ankle

1079
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,270
and that's the normal was pretty fat too.
Oh,

1080
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,520
oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
That's a big difference. Yeah.

1081
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,050
I get done this one.
It's like this big cause all the blood,

1082
00:55:16,051 --> 00:55:20,550
everything's swollen around the screw.
Wow. So does it fuck with you anymore?

1083
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,580
Like when it gets cold out or
anything like, yeah, mental,

1084
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,790
everything has mentioned to
me now everything in life,

1085
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,300
even when she hates it because I tell
her all the time she had a negative uh,

1086
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,550
Nigga insight on something.
Like find the positive in it.

1087
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,610
Like it's all in your mind.
You can make the best of anything.

1088
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,500
And I mean this isn't this happening.
Like what are,

1089
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:42,850
you could be dead or
you good with no legs.

1090
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,010
Like she got her car smashed that work.
Somebody hit the side of a tour,

1091
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,590
it all up and had to go in
the shot and he was like, Hey,

1092
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,710
the windows didn't break.

1093
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:51,930
Those like thinking about it
drives and your windows ain't Bro.

1094
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:56,880
It's the middle of winter. They ain't
gotta be cold. It can get hurt. Yeah.

1095
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,660
It's like a million different
things you can find to be sad,

1096
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,730
but find the good thing
is to find the positive.

1097
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,940
It's going to get fixed eventually.
So this ankle fucks with you still,

1098
00:56:05,941 --> 00:56:08,940
but not enough to stop you.
I'm nothing to stop me and you,

1099
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,990
but does it affect you at all when
you kick things? Depends. Yeah,

1100
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,750
they digging like if I can,
if they go to do the elbow,

1101
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,470
like I go to kick the liver and you go
to sit on it and like the elbow kind of

1102
00:56:19,471 --> 00:56:23,320
catch it. I feel it. But again,
it doesn't stop me. Right. Lasts

1103
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,550
15 minutes. That's nothing last. So
my last so long I'm a bouncer sound.

1104
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:31,960
Keep going. Yeah. So you
get out of the injury,

1105
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,910
you have the cast on you
for five or six months,

1106
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:37,600
you realize how blessed you were to be
able to move around and that feeling once

1107
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:40,450
you get your your leg back under
you and start moving again,

1108
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,460
what is the changes you make?

1109
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,880
How do you start to move your
life in this positive way? Well,

1110
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:50,220
after I made that first job and I
realized I'm, I'm good like at first,

1111
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:54,340
not of myself, but I made it because I
told myself I can do it. I made it here.

1112
00:56:54,341 --> 00:56:57,340
There's no injuries. I'm fine. I
thought it was just slow and steady.

1113
00:56:57,341 --> 00:57:00,760
Just start hand fighting like good the
little you've got to take down dummies a

1114
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:03,950
hang on the wall, there's go down and
move, you know, not nothing fashion.

1115
00:57:03,951 --> 00:57:06,160
It's work hand fighting.
Just kinda grabbed her leg,

1116
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:07,510
working on my shots in and out,

1117
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:10,920
in and out in the morning before practice
and I used to go wash the gospel off

1118
00:57:10,921 --> 00:57:14,380
season, practice study and then
when I came back it was just,

1119
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,200
Oh I have to heavyweight coach
that coached and we drill today.

1120
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,910
You asked me to Julie. Yeah, coach
could see it. I just want to work for,

1121
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,620
I'm going to do a little bit extra
stuff. Natural practice, work with me,

1122
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,180
then the other coach or come work with me.

1123
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:30,490
It got to the point where like in the
morning I was in there before school and I

1124
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:33,790
was there after school for practice.
Now stay afterward, coaching drills,

1125
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:34,270
different stuff.

1126
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,480
They must have been so confused and they
didn't like the coach says night and

1127
00:57:37,481 --> 00:57:39,670
day like they weren't doing.
Now is night and day.

1128
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,850
Tell us what's so strange.

1129
00:57:40,851 --> 00:57:43,620
You got this lazy kid and all
of a sudden he becomes a savage.

1130
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,670
They haven't, when I go back
to the school and I'm visit,

1131
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,370
they always asked me to come talk to these
people. They call me a success story.

1132
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,690
Not only was this, but I grew up in
an area where there was no black.

1133
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,140
I was the only black family there,
so we had racism my whole life.

1134
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,150
You know what I mean? Dealing
with that. So that's another man.

1135
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:00,600
That was the mental, the mental,
the mental fucks of it all.

1136
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,730
Like no matter what I did,
you're going to be wrong.

1137
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,810
Like I was another core Anderson to that
was even worse and he was actually a

1138
00:58:06,811 --> 00:58:08,700
troublemaker.
So when he would get in trouble,

1139
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:11,360
they would always come get me out of the
classroom like it was Cory and I will

1140
00:58:11,361 --> 00:58:14,250
get put on it. I ain't even did it. I
was a good kid, never did nothing wrong.

1141
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,580
But I'm not an officer principal
walking like wrong core. I'm like,

1142
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:20,430
of course it's the wrong course.
Every time I remember Corey,

1143
00:58:20,431 --> 00:58:23,640
Richard Anderson and Corey see Anderson,
I'm Corey. See he's Cory Richard,

1144
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,550
but they always pulled me in
there and it was just cause I was,

1145
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:30,450
it was only a few of us in my high school
in the fact that I never did drugs.

1146
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,021
She was like,

1147
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:33,030
when we was on the ring I said I don't
wanna I wanna come in and show him shoot

1148
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:35,280
with you. I don't want to smoke weed. I
never did drugs. I don't do none of that.

1149
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,510
I've been a good kid but to deal with
that stuff I used to get pulled over for

1150
00:58:39,511 --> 00:58:43,230
no reason. I had a nice truck. Stn
drops the ground rims and speakers.

1151
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,930
I used to get pulled over and then my
friends get put in cuffs and sit on the

1152
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:48,600
curb when they searched the car looking
for something when I went to college is

1153
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:49,434
the same thing.

1154
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,740
Get pulled over all the time and teach
you and be like every time you late for

1155
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:54,960
class you said you got to put off.
Like I was telling him on the way here,

1156
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,960
like I'm serious. I have classmates that
saw, I'm like no, he's telling the truth.

1157
00:58:57,961 --> 00:58:59,940
Miss Starks,
we saw them on the side of the road,

1158
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,320
like he always gets pulled over cause
it's nice vehicle black and they always

1159
00:59:03,321 --> 00:59:05,460
thinking of some,
I know that's just where I'm from.

1160
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:10,290
So dealing with that and the mentality,
I finally figured out, like I said,

1161
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:13,320
that's why when people doubt me,
I think trying to prove wrong,

1162
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,530
because I had coaches in high school,
I won't put names on air,

1163
00:59:16,531 --> 00:59:19,440
but I remember even when I was doing good,

1164
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,960
I knew I was doing good because I had led

1165
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,770
team a sex. I didn't start,
you know what I mean?

1166
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,210
I lay the the starting lineman out or
beat this guy and this and that and this

1167
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:32,600
and that and I never got the
position or something was around it.

1168
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:36,170
And then when I came back after I made
you a sickle, he, oh, I remember this.

1169
00:59:36,171 --> 00:59:38,750
Like I ain't trying to hear that and
I'm only coaching at high school.

1170
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:41,420
I will say that that believed him.
It was a wrestling coach, Marty,

1171
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:44,510
because Marty Causa made
everything possible to make,

1172
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,470
let me meet Dave Clem, who was my
junior college coach who led me to Russ.

1173
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:50,780
Dave Grimm led me to been asked her who?

1174
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:53,570
Tim fader and everything and I've been
blessed with the people in my life to

1175
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:57,140
bring me to Frankie and mark and Ricardo
and I got like the awesome and people

1176
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:58,310
around me like my mom says,

1177
00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:01,460
you've always been blessed to have a
good circle of people and the one year I

1178
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:04,880
had a bad coach in college and it's like
my mom said we didn't have so much good.

1179
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,660
Don't let this one coach to Fiji now
I'll never forget him. Jason Valley,

1180
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,740
I'll put his name on air.

1181
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,660
That guy at that made me the toughest
man I could because no matter what I did,

1182
01:00:14,661 --> 01:00:16,790
he wanted to make sure he could break him.
He had control over me.

1183
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:21,170
I was 16 I was away from home and
South Carolina, no family, no money.

1184
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:25,190
He having it on a full ride and he
was just used that I got you here.

1185
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,640
You here because of me. You do this or
I'm going to cut you cut meat in. Fuck it.

1186
01:00:29,641 --> 01:00:32,960
Come, hi. Y'All seen I go get recruited
and he put him back on the scene.

1187
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,960
You still an ally, you can't do that.
This is new. So it's kind of like,

1188
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:39,380
I think that's where I got the mentality
where I want to prove people wrong

1189
01:00:39,381 --> 01:00:43,130
because I beat the starter
and I beat him bad.

1190
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:46,360
1301 toilet and every rests are beating
them. But you still not started.

1191
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:49,130
What the fuck you make them run them off
for? Like I didn't beat him every time.

1192
01:00:49,131 --> 01:00:52,580
When you lost on the first dual in a
match by riding time the first week of

1193
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:55,650
school, not beat him every time. But
you're not gonna let me start. Nope.

1194
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:59,300
Cause he pins people and you only get
points kind of like finally he knocks

1195
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:03,520
people out and you only win by decision
and that's kind of like, all right.

1196
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,850
So I left, went to Whitewater where
I met Ben and everything else again.

1197
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,180
Went there,
they coach knew who I was.

1198
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:13,610
Nobody else knew who I was cause I didn't
get the rest of the year before I was

1199
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:17,480
a bench warmer. The kid on the team but
never wrestled. That's so crazy. Killed.

1200
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:17,901
Never asked.

1201
01:01:17,901 --> 01:01:20,660
My parents would drive 16 hours of watch
me duel and he'd make me sit in the

1202
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:22,760
bench the whole term. It'd be
a tournament. He'll be like,

1203
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:25,310
you're not rustling today. My parents
were here like, you're not wrestling.

1204
01:01:25,311 --> 01:01:26,320
They're like,
my friends drove six.

1205
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:30,140
You're not wrestling like you got
me eight hours from the school.

1206
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,740
My parents drove all yet this
guy's problem. We don't know.

1207
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,670
But I got teammates now and God is still
that fighting everything and they're

1208
01:01:37,671 --> 01:01:40,730
like, Bro, you got out of there and
like a lot of guys, he had them.

1209
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,080
They're academically,

1210
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,750
he like all we're going to short term
short credits you blisters and that you're

1211
01:01:44,751 --> 01:01:46,160
gonna do half credits.
You're going to be at a restaurant.

1212
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,940
So he was just sitting at the heck to
a loss of dis. He just wanted to win.

1213
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,710
That was it. So like guys are
finished wrestling career.

1214
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:55,130
They didn't have the courtesy.
Gradually like, coach, I need help.

1215
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:58,220
Like what can I do? You don't wrestle
for me no more. I was like, Bro,

1216
01:01:58,221 --> 01:02:01,100
I'm only here because of you.
But I left and he was our,

1217
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,350
he kept hitting me up like, oh,
you keep coming back next year.

1218
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:06,200
I let you start next year. If you
beat him again, fuck. And I was like,

1219
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:09,410
exactly what? I said, I want you to Aad
office. Told them what was going on.

1220
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:12,230
They gave me my letters and trends.
Let me transfer out,

1221
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,900
but I couldn't go division two like you
can leave but you can't go division two

1222
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,900
he can't hold you back. And
we're like, that's fine. I'm out.

1223
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,130
I left like a before school and he

1224
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,950
showed up at my house one day. You're
like, where are you? I'm at your house.

1225
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:26,730
Like I'm gone bro. And what do you mean
I'm going like I'm done. I'm transferring.

1226
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:29,070
Like you can't ask them the papers.
How did you get that?

1227
01:02:29,071 --> 01:02:31,080
Like I went behind your back.
I got it done.

1228
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:34,320
I'm out of here and then Tim
Fader to coach a whitewater.

1229
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,400
I remember he put them at my house.

1230
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:37,890
I almost didn't go back to school cause
he kinda got in my head like I don't

1231
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:40,740
want to go nowhere else and waste my
last year of school doing the same shit.

1232
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:45,150
I can't trust anybody there. I took
what, 60 years before an injury,

1233
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,950
but I was beating everybody,
you know,

1234
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:51,330
I mean lots of d one d two guys and so
it was like I don't want to go anywhere

1235
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:53,310
else and somebody's gonna
screw me over for ride.

1236
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,730
But then this guy pulled up my driveway
when I was working one day. He's like,

1237
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,010
I'm looking for Corey Anderson.
I've seen him before,

1238
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,190
but I didn't really know much about
him and we went to lunch or whatever.

1239
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,810
He was like,
I know your story,

1240
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,980
but thing is I can't give you a full
ride because the d three we can't give

1241
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:11,250
money. I want you to wrestle for me,
this, this and this. And like I said,

1242
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:14,280
when I went d three, nobody knew who
I was because I didn't get to wrestle,

1243
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,710
but he knew like, we're not even
gonna let you rest for a while.

1244
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:19,200
So I thought the right off the get go.
Like what was the same shit?

1245
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:19,921
Like what the fuck?
He's like,

1246
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,410
no it ain't that cause I don't
want people to know what we got.

1247
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:26,430
We're going to wait till the first home
duel and I'm going to let you loose in

1248
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:28,170
the first home, drive the number
three dude in the country.

1249
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,540
And I never forget that way cause
it's you ready? Like what's your mean?

1250
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,110
Like it's the time you get to come out.
Gave him my thing,

1251
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,330
like you ready to show out?
Like you know, I'm ready dog,

1252
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:38,760
the number three guy out by
like 12 points and he's like,

1253
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:42,330
who the fuck is this kid? I was
like, yes. I'm finally home.

1254
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,160
And then shortly after I met Russ Davey,

1255
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,290
a guy who came from Colorado
who coached in Wisconsin.

1256
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,110
He was my heavyweight coach, Olympic
guy. And then uh, he brought in,

1257
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:54,210
been asking is how I got in a fight in
the bin. It was just like, like I said,

1258
01:03:54,211 --> 01:03:55,080
the people around you,

1259
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:58,260
he's just Mosey like I'm
blessed I'm saying or thinking
about it and it makes me

1260
01:03:58,261 --> 01:04:00,540
feel good cause all the things I've
been through and everything and it all

1261
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:04,140
worked out. Yeah. The reason I haven't
lesson Dick Coach probably it helped,

1262
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,930
it helped me. It wasn't about, and
my coach told me when I signed,

1263
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,011
when I signed like,

1264
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,990
cause it gave me a it as the one that
kept saying they give me a full ride.

1265
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:11,400
He kept saying court,
it ain't all about the money.

1266
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,020
Like it's the most of the Sydney and live.

1267
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:16,830
It's not about the money coach Clem and
Steven Rally and they both said like

1268
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:18,490
it's not about the money corp remember,

1269
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:21,930
remembers most of the most
important decision of your
life. Don't let the money.

1270
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:25,440
Few. But that was, that's what
it was for me. I'm a, you know,

1271
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:28,350
I went to the school as a walk home pretty
much now I'm getting full offers from

1272
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:30,480
everywhere and I'm going
to a number one school,

1273
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:32,280
division two and they give me a full ride.

1274
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,700
Like I thought that was something when
I got there I figured out what he meant

1275
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:39,330
and I'll never forget calling both coach
like you guys are right and I'm back

1276
01:04:39,331 --> 01:04:41,820
home now let's try to figure
out what's now we can go in AI.

1277
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,620
I know a few schools that
won't get as good coaches,

1278
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:46,140
Blah Blah Blah and I'm just going
to chill and think about it.

1279
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:50,520
When that coach Kane in the fact that
he came to my house, reached out to him,

1280
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:54,000
he told me, I can't give you money but
I want you for you and as a leader.

1281
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,090
And I first got there even though he
told me he wasn't gonna let me wrestle.

1282
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:00,000
He let me run practices for like the
first month because he couldn't teach it

1283
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,370
before season. Got Things like I
want you to like run practice this,

1284
01:05:02,371 --> 01:05:05,390
this and this. Cause you
got that mentality. You can
help these guys show us.

1285
01:05:05,391 --> 01:05:08,990
You did in d two number one school.
You can show us stuff here. You know,

1286
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,250
I ended up being the first NCAA all
American or instead of like finals the

1287
01:05:12,251 --> 01:05:13,950
school had in 22 years,
you know,

1288
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:17,470
I lead a team and take downs all the way
up until like the regional tournament.

1289
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,320
My roommate,
when we had a competition going on,

1290
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:22,540
I did a lot of things that most
people didn't see heavyweights do.

1291
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,780
The way I shot, the way our wrestling,
my mentality, I was always working.

1292
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,330
I was going to do a strength
and conditioning before
practice and before the

1293
01:05:29,331 --> 01:05:29,650
morning,

1294
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:32,560
like six o'clock we asked you in the
conditioning and I've got a class at one

1295
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:33,640
and I'd be in the gym lifting.

1296
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:37,330
I don't start the training till three
and it went from just me to me and my

1297
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:38,151
teammate.
Oh,

1298
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:41,200
me and my roommate to other teammates
and like is that people will see how

1299
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:43,180
you're doing it. And they were
jumping in and before you know,

1300
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:46,960
it was like six or seven
of us working out. Yeah.

1301
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:51,250
And we just motivate each other.
And the bond. We had her as a team,

1302
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,550
like I remember getting it and everybody's
like, oh what's our goal on the,

1303
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:55,560
I thought about was national,

1304
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:59,980
we want to win nationals or win conference
look like what the Fuck Y'all talking

1305
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:00,570
about conference?

1306
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:03,670
I was like the first step you got
conference regionals all is national.

1307
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:06,430
What about the big picture? Like oh
we would never one conference before.

1308
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:11,560
Like we should still want to get
nationals and like by the end of the year

1309
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,690
everybody was feeding off each other.
We had,

1310
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:18,490
we had three guys from the same high
school meet a 97 89 or 87 or 84 pounds,

1311
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:19,324
excuse me.

1312
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,060
And they call it as a high nigga death
row cause I was at school and like death

1313
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,110
row sugar night and all of that.

1314
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:26,740
So one got prayed up shirts and
it was us three and it was like,

1315
01:06:26,741 --> 01:06:29,590
it was so cool to have three guys
that was from the same school.

1316
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:32,680
We grew up right down the street from
each other but we all went separate ways.

1317
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,340
One went here, one went there, we
ended up in junior college together.

1318
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,220
We and the one guy at our very last year,

1319
01:06:39,221 --> 01:06:42,250
we all ended up together as a
team captains, senior years.

1320
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:44,200
I last time to do it together to Hoo Rah.

1321
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,860
We brought like our whole high school
would come to all our matches and there's

1322
01:06:47,861 --> 01:06:50,470
only like an hour from home.
It was just cool man.

1323
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:54,700
And I was like I said when I met Ben there
and he brought me to this thing and I

1324
01:06:54,701 --> 01:06:57,250
didn't want to fight again. I
was, I had a doubt in my mind

1325
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:00,480
go to that, but I want to go back
to your high, your high school days.

1326
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:03,760
When you made that big shift, did
you slip at all like you, you,

1327
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,710
you went from being a guy who was kind
of lazy and unmotivated to a guy who is

1328
01:07:07,711 --> 01:07:09,960
very disciplined that it
was like night and day,

1329
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,170
but was there ever a time where
you fell back to your old ways?

1330
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,350
I mean it was,

1331
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:19,351
sounds like it took a lot of motivation
in pep talk to myself to get out and do

1332
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:22,570
something every time like I
wanted to instead of go work out,

1333
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,510
go play video games.

1334
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:26,590
All was big in a dirt bike and a four
wheeler and like when I get off the bus,

1335
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,060
you can hear the dirt
bikes coming to my house.

1336
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:30,010
I had the motocross track and my bag up.
Me and the neighbor,

1337
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:30,940
he had a freestyle track,

1338
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:33,490
got dirt bike track and I'd get off
the bus and be thinking like, God,

1339
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:36,100
I'm about to go do my homework and
had to go do a little workout lift or

1340
01:07:36,101 --> 01:07:40,120
something and you hear him come and it's
like, oh, I want to go ride and stay.

1341
01:07:40,121 --> 01:07:43,290
I want to go ride. But at the same time
like you're a restaurant, you're arrested.

1342
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,070
I forgot the two. Which
one is first? You know,

1343
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:48,520
I let the guys go ride and my track
and I do pushups or whatever and do my

1344
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:50,680
homework, whatever it was had
to do just a little something.

1345
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:53,080
I'm almost like get something am I did
a little bit something that's more than

1346
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:54,540
the next person.
You know,

1347
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:59,000
by the time my senior year came around
and it was Kinda like I still wasn't

1348
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,760
all of them,
but I was a little more,

1349
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:03,580
I didn't get it all in until after
that second injury in college.

1350
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:08,610
I just drink college was the same injury,
same, less same leg, different engines.

1351
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,930
What? What'd you do this time?
I snapped my leg and through.

1352
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:16,210
How'd he got this? Til this
day I, I just remember hearing,

1353
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:21,050
was it wrestling, wrestling? Me and my
coach drilling very slow, very slow.

1354
01:08:21,051 --> 01:08:22,190
June,
but we had brand new.

1355
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:25,520
Max said it was super sticky and I
have a brand new wrestling shoes,

1356
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:28,590
which were super sticky and I remember
that you're a coach Morgan high.

1357
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:31,250
So we're going to work to the chain
restaurant. I shoot a single day.

1358
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,100
You get the single back when I shoot
a doe. But you bumped with the hip.

1359
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:38,330
She snapped to your shot. He grabbed
a single day. I snapped the foot down.

1360
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:41,180
He shot dope. When I hit him with my
hips, I fell backwards and hear a pop,

1361
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:45,660
but I didn't feel it and he stood over.
I remember him standing on a few of us,

1362
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:48,830
both sides like, don't
look down. Don't look down.

1363
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:52,460
Now of course I'm gonna tell you, don't
look, you're going to look. I look at my,

1364
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:56,120
what was like point like
this and it was down. Ah,

1365
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,360
I turn it off as an armored car.

1366
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:01,930
We got a pool on the other side of the
door and I'm trying to get to doing this,

1367
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:06,030
John Myself and paint out a painkiller.
I can't have tool and DP.

1368
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:08,570
I'm trying to draw, but like it
hurt. Like I was like, I want to die.

1369
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,381
So I'm just going.

1370
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:13,390
I remember him pulling me over and try
to go through your mind when shock.

1371
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:18,210
It was shock. You don't think that's a
crazy thing. If you don't want to go drag,

1372
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:22,020
it hurts you snapchat. No, no, no.

1373
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,880
Not One spot.
Three spots.

1374
01:09:25,881 --> 01:09:28,490
So it was like shooting up your whole
legs and your back. It was like, oh,

1375
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,210
I just wanted just, oh. It's like I'm
just going go jump in the water. Wow.

1376
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,100
First thing my mind goes,
bear called falling water.

1377
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:41,060
I wasn't the most sane kid but that was
the most certain first they on my mind

1378
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,000
go find the water.

1379
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,060
Just just ended in and they flipped me
over and I remember they threw it up on a

1380
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:48,830
punching bag to do with the old injury.
Nothing good though.

1381
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,470
It's completed are totally different.

1382
01:09:50,471 --> 01:09:54,270
I like four or five inches up from no
injuries. Snapped freak accidents. What?

1383
01:09:54,271 --> 01:09:56,890
I kept saying hospital, it's a freak
accident. What did they do then?

1384
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:00,840
Go to the hospital that day and they
snap him to guide us, snatches it back,

1385
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,580
pulls her in,
smashing lines,

1386
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:05,280
all the bones up and they put like
we're putting the cast from now,

1387
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:09,040
but you got to get plates and
pins to sit the street and that.

1388
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,040
When I was out for,
again,

1389
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:15,041
I was October 27 and I came back after
at least back January 13 to 14 it was

1390
01:10:17,911 --> 01:10:20,970
like a little bit before regional and
we didn't have a heavyweight all year

1391
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:23,370
because I got hurt and you know the
guys got kicked out of school, whatever.

1392
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:26,330
So three months ish. Yeah, he'll fat.

1393
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:29,890
I wasn't back but I was cleared to start
drilling and we're begging the coach

1394
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:30,990
like coach,
just let me come back.

1395
01:10:30,991 --> 01:10:33,690
I can say it was six points because every
time when went got on the rest of this

1396
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:37,720
automatic six did they have to put plates
in your Shin on on side of my late,

1397
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:40,110
you're gonna play it.
You can feel it if you bring your hand up.

1398
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:44,340
Donald's like all bent up and from now
all the wars and shit kicks in. Wrestling.

1399
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:49,670
It's like all wobbly holds all
kinds of stuff from getting kicked,

1400
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:52,530
getting kicked in it from wrestling.
People do foot sweeps.

1401
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,780
You ever get to look at an x ray
of it to see what it looks like?

1402
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:58,500
I have an extra forever. I should see
what it looks like pretty bad by now.

1403
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,190
I remember my first term it when
somebody's foot swept me. Oh my goodness.

1404
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:06,870
That feeling like God having an under
hook and he kicked that plate and I just

1405
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:08,100
felt like it didn't kick my feet.

1406
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:11,220
I just fail because it's the first
time you feel it in that pain ship up.

1407
01:11:11,221 --> 01:11:13,530
You've never felt it right.
Your nerves run up down there.

1408
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,910
So when it hit and everything just shut
and I fell and he pay me. I was like,

1409
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:19,320
it was like, what's wrong? I'm like, Yo,
my leg gave him, I'm still on the mat.

1410
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:21,760
Like I don't know what the fuck
happened there. Like your nerves.

1411
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:25,260
It try and sound like you got nerves on
the side of the leg. You're at the plate.

1412
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,520
We did probably kicked it.

1413
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,520
He hit the plate and another
thing you had to get in my mind,

1414
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:30,870
I said like this is going to happen often.

1415
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:34,260
You just got a bit of a tough ended up
and just go through. Yeah. You have a,

1416
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:36,930
an extra vulnerable spot now. Yeah. Yeah.

1417
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:39,520
And have you been low leg
kick there a lot. Yeah,

1418
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:44,310
he did it like four times low Lakey.
It's just like I said,

1419
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:45,780
I got to a point now I just deal with it.

1420
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:50,160
That was in 2007 this is 2019
it's 12 years of dealing with it.

1421
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:52,380
You get to a point where it's kind of
like, it's not really a pain anymore.

1422
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:54,900
It's just a just a pesky injury.
You can feel it,

1423
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:58,380
but some of those injuries they'll go in
after it's healed up and take the plate

1424
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:01,530
out. They say they can
do that, but to do that,

1425
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,430
because I got the broken pins
cause those pens are broke.

1426
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,290
They got cut like a whole section
on my leg. What do you mean?

1427
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:11,430
I'd be out of commission for a long
time and I was like, I'm used to it now.

1428
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,650
Is there any benefit if they do that?
I get my whole leg back.

1429
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:19,680
I grabbed my leg, but that's the only
benefit. Like I said, I said I can train,

1430
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:23,410
right? Yeah. Like this is going to bother.
He's like, I deal with it when I retired,

1431
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:26,580
we do all of that, but right
now there's no problem. Wow.

1432
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,330
So you have this shift in high school,
you,

1433
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:34,080
you'll make it to senior year and
you're a different person night and day,

1434
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:38,040
but you're still not the Corey Anderson
of today. So the second injury,

1435
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,910
what is the second injury do for you when
you snapped it and the second injury?

1436
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:42,810
That was just,

1437
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:47,790
I mean that just because I
didn't get to show what I can do.

1438
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,810
It motivated me that much more that
when I come back I gotta be undeniable.

1439
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,420
I got to show,

1440
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:57,360
I got to do like nobody knows what I can
do because I didn't make it to state my

1441
01:12:57,361 --> 01:13:00,380
senior year in high school. But then
we went to team state and I pinned it,

1442
01:13:00,381 --> 01:13:01,560
got it took fourth in state.

1443
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:04,230
So I knew I could do it by
just saying make it there.

1444
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:06,780
So when I got hurt my freshman
freshman year, I was gone.

1445
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:10,140
That was the year I was going to show
people Koreans and which are used to know

1446
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:11,430
what you think this,
this and this.

1447
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,450
Then I got hurt and it kind of set me
back and I was just in my mind I was very,

1448
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:19,650
I was sad. Like I remember being
at home. I was emotionally sad,

1449
01:13:19,651 --> 01:13:21,960
but when I went to go back and
I couldn't focus on wrestling,

1450
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:25,110
I just put my mind on schoolwork and
that's when I figured out I can do

1451
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:29,870
schoolwork. I finished my freshman year
with a 3.25 GPA. After missing like three,

1452
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,710
four months, I had to make up everything
and take tests and that's not real.

1453
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:35,220
I was like, I can do that
too, so that was more thing.

1454
01:13:35,221 --> 01:13:38,340
I got the thing I got out of that injury.
Not so much the athletic part.

1455
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,680
I was more motivated to
work even harder next year,

1456
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:45,150
but I found the fact that I can do
schoolwork if I want you. Again,

1457
01:13:45,151 --> 01:13:49,110
it's just a mental thing. I have to
take the time to study. I've never,

1458
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:52,590
I had never studied before
that ever then do any homework.

1459
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:55,560
It was our boss on by his homework or
take somebody knows and trying to fill in

1460
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:57,870
answers just to get something to say.
It was a completion credit,

1461
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:02,640
but when I had had nothing to do, I
couldn't wrestle. I couldn't, you know,

1462
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:06,000
I couldn't run, I couldn't
go play basketball in the
back, but everybody else,

1463
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:10,650
it was the only back and focus on
our school at the time I came back,

1464
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,130
my GPA like two point

1465
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,960
something because I hadn't
been in class for so long,

1466
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,700
so I had to get audit up a it before the
end of the year and finished with a 3.0

1467
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:21,590
at least not finished with
a 3.25 for that was my,

1468
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,630
to make academic all American was my,
that was my highlight in my freshman year.

1469
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:29,140
I didn't get the rest of all American,
but I had the academic, all American.

1470
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,890
That's something I can work on
because as a kid, my parents,

1471
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:37,891
she's my mom and eighth grade bet me $100
I wouldn't graduate my own mother and

1472
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:42,010
she's my mom. My biggest motivation
for myself before my son came here,

1473
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:44,470
my mother was the hand that
pushed me over everything.

1474
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:47,110
She's always my dad
comes to the work ethic.

1475
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:50,830
My mom was always make sure you do things
right, you can do this, this and this.

1476
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:52,750
I always helped me.
I struggle with reading.

1477
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:54,810
She's helped me learn how to read faster,

1478
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:59,050
read better and do things to the best
of my ability and academic roar because

1479
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,150
sports and hard work is going to beat her.

1480
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:05,380
But education some you can always fall
back on so but how has your so bad?

1481
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:06,550
I used to and I lived next door,

1482
01:15:06,551 --> 01:15:09,880
so the middle school selves back to eighth
grade year they opened a new high or

1483
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:12,920
middle school up the street from my house.
So I would mess up from school.

1484
01:15:12,921 --> 01:15:15,430
I don't do homework. I don't know
why. I think I would get away with it.

1485
01:15:15,431 --> 01:15:16,091
I'm getting to class.

1486
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:18,580
My mom sit in the principal's office
because it was going for a walk for it.

1487
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:21,070
They call it according to his
homework again cause she was on it.

1488
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:23,470
She would call like of course
messed up in school, call me.

1489
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,250
She had me in summer camp.

1490
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:29,560
I had to go to summer school one year
when I pass all my classes because she

1491
01:15:29,561 --> 01:15:33,610
wanted me to get that fact like just
cause you pass, they let you pass.

1492
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:36,750
I mean you did good, you passed, but you
got to learn how to work. You're going to.

1493
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,380
But that was another thing.

1494
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:41,320
I didn't have the mentality that my
mom wanted me to have when it come to

1495
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:44,590
working for academics and stuff.
So what made you do that? What,

1496
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:47,860
what was the shift that caused that
from the, the injury? The second set,

1497
01:15:47,861 --> 01:15:49,300
one second I had that us to focus on,

1498
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:52,460
it was either that or become a
bum at the school of cinema room,

1499
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,710
skipping class and fell out.

1500
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:56,380
So I had to get my grades up if I
wanted the rest of the next year.

1501
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:59,020
So it probably been something
that was bothering you already.

1502
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:00,280
They didn't bother me.

1503
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:04,720
I didn't care about my grades because I
was athletic doing athletics and the way,

1504
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,890
it's kind of like the movies have you
competing and they know you're good,

1505
01:16:08,891 --> 01:16:12,760
your assets to a team, the teachers help
you. They tried it, they don't give you,

1506
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,280
but they'll help you out take
you got questions, ask questions.

1507
01:16:15,281 --> 01:16:16,114
They won't fail you.

1508
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,000
You know if I they can do everything
they can to make sure I learn.

1509
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:23,200
So when you realizing because the
injury that maybe your athletic career

1510
01:16:23,201 --> 01:16:26,120
wouldn't be there and you needed,
you needed to get this education,

1511
01:16:26,121 --> 01:16:29,560
fight it cause not, didn't have the help
I had in class when I was an athlete.

1512
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:31,780
They help you a little bit more but not,
I'm not wrestling.

1513
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:35,920
It's kind of like my GPA doesn't matter
for the team anymore and I haven't

1514
01:16:35,921 --> 01:16:37,750
missed it from school for so long.
When I came back,

1515
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,660
it's kind of like now I got a lot to
make up for has got to do it on my own.

1516
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:41,591
I was studying,

1517
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:45,730
that's all I had class and my dorm room
class or Dorma from that point on from

1518
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:50,560
that injury then you would you get your
academic work in order and you start

1519
01:16:50,561 --> 01:16:54,430
being disciplined in all our areas of
your life and you feel like that carried

1520
01:16:54,431 --> 01:16:57,190
over every Catholics as where
everything works together.

1521
01:16:57,710 --> 01:17:00,670
Everything works for one thing
that's come out of that. Okay.

1522
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:03,860
Like first thing we learned orientation,
the college coach comes to,

1523
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:04,720
we going around room like guys,

1524
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:08,830
we got your athletic scholarship but
you're here as a student athlete and I

1525
01:17:08,831 --> 01:17:10,010
remember back and coaching at the

1526
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,110
same college and him giving the same
speech and the right on the board.

1527
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,860
Student athlete, we gonna make it
in two parts. First part student,

1528
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:19,520
second part athlete so that we don't write
it on the board. What does this mean?

1529
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:24,110
So first priority school
after that next priority,

1530
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:27,650
athletics to me.
After that you got your family,

1531
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:31,400
then it's making sure you stay out
of trouble and that the last thing,

1532
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:34,340
the very most important thing and to
come to college, it's just social life.

1533
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:35,503
The rest of that.

1534
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:38,930
Everything else comes first and at the
end then you were a bunch of friends and

1535
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:41,300
trying to be cool and all the extra stuff.
You know,

1536
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,140
I'm 17 when I went to college, I
graduated high school at 17. So I'm young,

1537
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:48,440
I'm not even an adult, but in my mind, I'm
on my own, I'm doing what I want, blah,

1538
01:17:48,441 --> 01:17:51,590
blah, blah. I'm showing I'm
being an ass, you know? Right.

1539
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,010
Not like getting in trouble but not
paying attention in school and not worry

1540
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:58,140
about chorus doing part. I'm just
an athlete. They're not gonna find,

1541
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:01,460
ask questions, act like I'm struggling
and they tried to help me out, you know.

1542
01:18:01,461 --> 01:18:04,250
But I know they're not going to give
me an f because, um, I'm trying,

1543
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,500
but I really wasn't.
I'm asking questions.

1544
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:08,840
I'm sitting in front of class so
you're not going to give me an f,

1545
01:18:08,841 --> 01:18:11,730
but they're going to make sure I
don't, I'm eligible. The rest of it,

1546
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,940
I'm not going to fail. Right.
So when you get Angela,

1547
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:18,320
you realize that ain't there no more
cause she ain't got none the rest of for

1548
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:20,350
you all school now.
So now you got to you,

1549
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:22,190
you can't say I got practice so I can't,

1550
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:24,440
I can't stay was not a
big eye opener for you.

1551
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,620
When you realize that you
can do good at school too.

1552
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,750
That's 100% because in your
whole life when you didn't try,

1553
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:33,740
you didn't care and it had that no child
left behind pretty much before they

1554
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:35,900
made the official thing.
It was always there.

1555
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:39,200
Cause I know I didn't do enough in school
but somehow I graduated every year.

1556
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,840
Somehow I graduated.
Cause there's always one teacher,

1557
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,730
one person I looked out for me,

1558
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:46,150
I guess I've been blessed to
have that in middle school.

1559
01:18:46,151 --> 01:18:49,970
Was Ms for met to this day. We still
talk, I go home, we have lunch, breakfast,

1560
01:18:49,971 --> 01:18:51,170
whatever will.
Yes.

1561
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,450
If it wasn't for her I probably would
have dropped out of high school.

1562
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:55,760
That's cool. Yeah. That's very cool.

1563
01:18:55,790 --> 01:19:00,470
So so in college now you're athletic
careers in order, you're, you're,

1564
01:19:00,471 --> 01:19:02,600
you're getting your schoolwork in.

1565
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:07,700
What was it that made you even
consider being an MMA fighter?

1566
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:13,090
Been asked her funky ban on Cuban and
I didn't even consider he tricked me

1567
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,280
because I went,
you're kidding me all through.

1568
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:17,980
Cause I had teammates that date MMA,

1569
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,140
they all rest but when it's over they
all the amateur MMA fights of course he

1570
01:19:21,141 --> 01:19:22,610
should try it like your
movement and stuff.

1571
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:25,760
You're so light on your feet and
fast as your weight. You can kill it.

1572
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,470
I got a metal plate in my leg bro.

1573
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,840
I had tore my shoulder and I got
some areas I wouldn't be good.

1574
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:34,460
I'd be laid up too much. I didn't like
what you think this isn't. This denied,

1575
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:38,720
denied. Denied. My senior year,
fifth year senior being comes up,

1576
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:41,330
he started working with me and Ben was
like one of my main restaurant partners

1577
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:44,420
and kind of like you said Lemon Chieko
like you got somebody you go to punch.

1578
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:47,660
He's not there because the same way on
wrestling and I used to try to pick his

1579
01:19:47,661 --> 01:19:50,570
brain and how do you do this?
Like I'd be dead to right on a double leg.

1580
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:51,770
Pick you up in the air.

1581
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:54,590
I go to take you on and I land on my
face and you're nowhere to be found.

1582
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:57,570
You on my back. And how does that happen?
That's why they call me the fuck man.

1583
01:19:57,571 --> 01:20:01,100
I'm the king of the funk. I same here.
Come and praxis Sanders, kick it off,

1584
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:04,670
put his shoes on.
He just looked like a floppy guy.

1585
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:07,810
Like how his guy dinner thing about him.
He doesn't look physically person.

1586
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:11,090
This is being like, no, I'm
about to blow through this.

1587
01:20:11,091 --> 01:20:14,960
Do hidden where Aa gone every time.
High Christ gone. I took him down,

1588
01:20:14,961 --> 01:20:19,500
I think one time my college career clean
take down and then it's just like what

1589
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:23,160
the, and after college I was like,
I want to do the Olympics Bro.

1590
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:25,640
And you've been there, but I don't
know any freestyle rules. Oh,

1591
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,341
we can work together.

1592
01:20:26,341 --> 01:20:30,930
Whenever him and my coach both wrestle
at the Olympic level working together and

1593
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:32,820
then one day send me, I just like,
oh, I'm not making it here today,

1594
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:36,780
but meet me here at this address. And we
will work, blah blah, blah. Bring a year.

1595
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,810
I get up there and Rufus sport,
but outside of a bank it's still like,

1596
01:20:40,811 --> 01:20:43,290
is there any for bank downstairs?
Yeah, because I'm looking like,

1597
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:45,210
what don't fuck is, where
am I going? I texted like,

1598
01:20:45,211 --> 01:20:47,490
oh it goes to the science down and says
you're going to see a sign roof for

1599
01:20:47,491 --> 01:20:50,070
sport, this and this. And I walked
down the stairs like what is,

1600
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:54,120
he must have Matt senior's home
and I go in there and you got UFC,

1601
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:56,750
they're doing a Anthony pay
this doing a jump off kicked,

1602
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,490
making some photo for
the magazine or whatever.

1603
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,140
And he got like Pascal [inaudible] and
Sergio page. You've got Ben Asheron.

1604
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,920
It was a few other Eric Koch, other
UFC guys. And I'm looking like,

1605
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:08,401
what is going on?

1606
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:11,770
He always asked hidden pads and when
my practice and being around the Kate,

1607
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:13,200
Oh hey, cool, I'm glad
you could make this.

1608
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:16,620
Isn't this I say no wrestling gym
when he says, he's like, oh yeah,

1609
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:21,450
well I want to talk to you about
that. We're to a new sport. What,

1610
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:26,040
what? Yes. Like, I mean, I know I heard
you say you didn't want to fight whatever,

1611
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,770
bro. I think you could be good. I
just want you to try. If you don't,

1612
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,950
if you don't like it after you try it,
we'd go back to wrestling, blah blah blah,

1613
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:34,470
this and this. I'm like, alright.

1614
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:37,110
And I go to the front desk and
the lady I met at the front desk,

1615
01:21:37,111 --> 01:21:40,630
they introduced me. It was my wife. Now
they didn't know Jamie. She's in my desk.

1616
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:45,090
So I get the gear to give me some gloves
and whatever and I was like, you know,

1617
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:48,160
I really don't want to do the training,
the ice on the side and watch.

1618
01:21:48,161 --> 01:21:51,630
I hit the bag a little bit.
I'm just watching and at the time,

1619
01:21:51,631 --> 01:21:54,270
this is where my mind was already set.
You got an opportunity, you got to try it.

1620
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:57,270
But I didn't try it the day I remember
driving home. It's hour and a half dry.

1621
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,970
Hold your, I'm at myself like you a bitch
talking about selling you a bitch. Boy.

1622
01:22:00,971 --> 01:22:03,810
You didn't do that yet. Arbitrary.
You ain't even take it. You a bitch.

1623
01:22:03,811 --> 01:22:05,970
I can't believe you didn't do that.
So I get home, I tell Ben like,

1624
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:08,310
I'm sorry I didn't try but I
like to do it again. Like whoa,

1625
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:10,770
it was good cause tomorrow
morning 9:00 AM we up there.

1626
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,750
I get up early seven 35 and motorcycle
up shoot all the way up to Milwaukee.

1627
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:19,510
I get their roof, Duke roof
element. Oh Cory, nice to
meet you. I heard about this,

1628
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,320
this, this like I can't, yes sir. I
didn't do it but I want to try it today.

1629
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:25,030
I just was like, well that's good.
I'm glad you came. Like why is that?

1630
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:26,070
Like Sticks Barn Day

1631
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:33,780
testing. I did amateur boxing.
They got when I broke my leg,

1632
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,200
yeah I did like boxing in the gym for
Rehab because my brother in law was

1633
01:22:37,201 --> 01:22:40,800
oppression of box at the time and
I had two amateur fights and uh,

1634
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,990
so I had that and I came home,

1635
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:47,680
my gloves and everything but old ratty
title gloves falling apart and like all I

1636
01:22:47,681 --> 01:22:50,310
got is my gloves and my shorts. I go,
well we got gear would get you stuff.

1637
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:52,200
Hey gear and Shin pads.
This isn't this.

1638
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:55,780
They gave me too obviously combat
corner Shim pass almost like a youth and

1639
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:57,390
wasn't extra loss on one coach,

1640
01:22:57,391 --> 01:23:01,160
my knee and one cover like half machine
and like there's old raggedy headgear

1641
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,530
and they got them all. He's like,
yeah man, it's all you need.

1642
01:23:03,531 --> 01:23:06,550
And so we're going to spa. So my time
I go with being so being, you know,

1643
01:23:06,551 --> 01:23:11,380
taking it easy on me. Boom, boom. He shoot
on me. I defended in MMA is different.

1644
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:14,200
I can sprawl out hard.
I well there you go.

1645
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,750
Now I'm gonna put you or somebody else.
Of course Anthony Pettis,

1646
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:21,860
he's too small like, well you need to do
and feel like to get kicked. What bow?

1647
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,600
I just kept kicking my leg
and I, Greg, what do you do?

1648
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:29,710
Like I'm arrested is I take them down.
I took him no lie. You do big family.

1649
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,480
You're going to hurt him. And they
put me with a heavyweight. He said,

1650
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:32,720
now I want just to take
everything you did.

1651
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:34,890
You was punching being
and you took him down.

1652
01:23:34,891 --> 01:23:36,370
It took nine Anthony to do everything.

1653
01:23:36,371 --> 01:23:40,030
We just got your size and I fucking just
hit him with a bunch of Jab crosses,

1654
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:42,380
blast double on a punch.
It's like just got,

1655
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:45,760
they ain't no grind but just hitting
like dog and stand up and do it again.

1656
01:23:45,761 --> 01:23:49,020
I did get us kept doing it, doing it,
doing it and it was over here like I act.

1657
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:50,860
There you go.
Your first process is not the way,

1658
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,070
and I hate to tell the court heard you
kept saying you're not a fighter but you

1659
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:57,190
are an MMA fighter and I can tell you
right now, but working with a lot of guys,

1660
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,850
you could be in the UFC in three
fights. Yeah, right. Whatever.

1661
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:03,070
I don't think like I'm dead
serious and three fights.

1662
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,800
So what you got and your mentality
from what I've seen in wrestling,

1663
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:10,060
if you put into this, you could be
in UFC in three fights, whatever,

1664
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,100
but I liked that. I liked the training
and I kept coming back and I never rested.

1665
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:16,600
This was 2012 right after college.

1666
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,140
That's not that long ago,
man.

1667
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:23,260
Oh my first day of 2013 top level MMA
fighter in one of the most talent rich

1668
01:24:24,591 --> 01:24:26,450
divisions in the light
heavyweight division.

1669
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:28,190
And you've only been
doing it for seven years.

1670
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:31,190
I was in the UFC was seven
months after my first bike,

1671
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:34,310
seven months and I was in
the top team within a year.

1672
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,720
So I'm learning. I didn't have an
amateur career. I had three fights,

1673
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:43,430
ultimate fighter one that top 10 and
I was at a year of all MMA training.

1674
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:45,880
That's it.
Saw people keep talking to shit,

1675
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:48,840
but I'm like, they don't understand.
I did this like most of these guys,

1676
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:50,730
I look at pictures of guys
I've been training with.

1677
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:54,570
I got guys at the gym now that's still
amateurs. They pose a throwback Thursday,

1678
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,030
my senior year in college,
I have a throwback picture.

1679
01:24:57,031 --> 01:25:00,420
It'd be me and college in 2007 it'd be
different like the third or fourth MMA

1680
01:25:00,421 --> 01:25:01,180
fight.

1681
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,730
It's like, and he's got to still
amateur. And how old are you now?

1682
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,890
I'm 29 did you still not even
really in your prime. You know what?

1683
01:25:06,891 --> 01:25:10,900
It was like 31 32 back. I said,
I'm coming in. I'm learning now.

1684
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,770
You are learning now,

1685
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:15,280
but that's crazy that you were in a
top 10 a year in the MMA training.

1686
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,590
They'll just,
cause we always cite Francis in Ghana,

1687
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,540
the Francis and gone was one
of the craziest stories ever.

1688
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:23,740
That guy goes from no MMA training at
all to five years later fighting for the

1689
01:25:23,741 --> 01:25:27,570
title you know at like,
but he's,

1690
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:32,910
what you did is as impressive the fact
that you hit top 10 with a year of MMA

1691
01:25:32,921 --> 01:25:35,680
training and that's bananas man.
Even in the tough house,

1692
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:36,401
I remember the guy was like,

1693
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:37,990
you could hear him in the
kitchen with all talking about,

1694
01:25:37,991 --> 01:25:40,320
oh what's your background in business?
I went on a tough with with

1695
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,350
four or five months experience,

1696
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:45,170
have my three fights back to back to the
bay and I remember my coach is pushing

1697
01:25:45,171 --> 01:25:48,020
it. That third fight we can get just
terrified. Why are you pushing so hard?

1698
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,400
And then when it was over and was like,
oh hi,

1699
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:52,490
this is why we had to get that
last fight off my fighter trials.

1700
01:25:52,491 --> 01:25:55,940
The next Tuesday in Indiana.
You're going fuck outta here.

1701
01:25:55,941 --> 01:25:59,950
I gotta work this and I'm going over and
they called me Monday night like, Yo,

1702
01:25:59,951 --> 01:26:01,730
you're doing like I'm at work.
I work night shift,

1703
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,130
hung off to one and when
he'd off Mimi and Maha

1704
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:06,260
site, what? We're going to Indiana like,

1705
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:09,630
I'm not going to get to USC and I'm going
to do it. I'm going to go to Holloway.

1706
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:13,280
Oh, all right. I see your mouse hung up
the phone. I get off, I go and I was like,

1707
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:15,800
Bro, what the fuck you talking about?
He jumped in drivers. He's like, Gideon,

1708
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:18,650
like what are you talking about? So you
were saying you want, if you get in,

1709
01:26:18,651 --> 01:26:22,460
you want to go the hard like
getting earned from doing
the ultimate fight. Yeah.

1710
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:24,790
I wanted to like get enough fights
and then somebody see me, he's like,

1711
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,900
oh here's your take a short
notice fight or whatever.

1712
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:30,540
It was a fantastic opportunity
for exposure and exactly.

1713
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:34,340
But in my mind I had just started three,
four months.

1714
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,440
I'm thinking like I'm just beating up
cans. I don't think I'm ready yet. Right.

1715
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:39,710
But they say like court,
we see you man like you,

1716
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,770
you have the opportunity to beat
these guys. Like you beating this guy.

1717
01:26:42,771 --> 01:26:45,410
He's been training forever. He's
been pro, he's been dilatory doesn't.

1718
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:47,660
Jacoby was my first sparring
partner and I went to Illinois.

1719
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:52,880
He had been in the UFC now and that was
one of my first and I was taking him

1720
01:26:52,881 --> 01:26:55,280
down and ground and pound but striking.
I didn't have that.

1721
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:57,140
But if I can do is use your takedowns man,

1722
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:01,250
you taking everybody out and you're
doing good. Use that. And when I left,

1723
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:04,430
when I went there and whatever, my
coach was like, just go do what you do.

1724
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,320
I have no doubt they're going to pick you.

1725
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:09,040
But the reason they picked
me wasn't the same. You know,

1726
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,480
they picked me thinking it was going
to be an easy fight for whoever,

1727
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:15,520
but it's backfired on me because my
work ethic, they didn't know me. Right.

1728
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:15,861
You know,

1729
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:18,440
I was cracking jokes like I can beat
anybody you having and they was laughing.

1730
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,590
I'm going to be laughing at my jokes. Come
to find out, they told him at the end,

1731
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:24,530
one guy told me like, you know, when we
picture, we didn't think you could win.

1732
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,170
I go after [inaudible] we
picked her because we thought
she was going to lose it.

1733
01:27:27,171 --> 01:27:30,560
Kelly and nuts and get him an easy fight
in and I'll look. It kind of backfired.

1734
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:32,900
And it was like,
cause they didn't know who I was.

1735
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:35,420
They didn't know him as a person.
And I name drop man, he used.

1736
01:27:35,421 --> 01:27:37,010
And I think that was the
only reason why I got there.

1737
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,370
Like I trained with Matt Hughes here and
there, Blah Blah. You know Maddie, Oh man,

1738
01:27:40,371 --> 01:27:42,320
he's our guy.
Oh can you make it to Vegas next week?

1739
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,400
I think I can make it yesterday.

1740
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:46,950
If he would have told me and I go
pack your bags, you're going wow.

1741
01:27:46,951 --> 01:27:49,040
And that was it. But you, the thing is,

1742
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:52,760
even though you were a year and you
were so many years into wrestling,

1743
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,080
and I think to this day that wrestling
is the most important skill in MMA

1744
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:57,980
because you get to dictate
where the fight takes place.

1745
01:27:58,130 --> 01:27:59,990
The superior wrestler gets to dis,

1746
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:02,510
every fight starts standing up and
you have to know how to strike.

1747
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,960
But a superior wrestler gets to
dictate where the fights take place.

1748
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:07,910
And you see that with guys like Khabib,

1749
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:12,620
he see that with so many
superior grapplers when
they get ahold of a guy it's

1750
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:16,010
their dominance is one of the most
important aspects of fighting.

1751
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:20,240
So you did have all that but that's,
I have the strike,

1752
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:24,320
the basic striking and wrestling. But like
I said, when I came to meet Mark Henry,

1753
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:25,783
Ricardo,
Amada,

1754
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:30,770
like that's what took me until two years
into your chat with him in two years.

1755
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:35,270
I was a year in like three months and I
guess that's why I didn't have anything.

1756
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,610
And Mark Tell people all the time,
like when you hear him say it,

1757
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:40,310
I am telling people all the time when
you guys want to see like hard working

1758
01:28:40,311 --> 01:28:44,240
with habit core, my core,
it is a purifier of what I,

1759
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:47,300
what I'm coaching because he came here
with nothing and like you get guys that

1760
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:49,460
come in and like Lance Palmer,
now he's been fight him.

1761
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:52,370
So he's wanting to Pfl you've got all
these guys have been fighting 10 12 years

1762
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:55,580
before they meet mark.
So it's kind of like they just tuning up.

1763
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:59,090
So anything when you got a guy like
me to has nothing. The Gym I was at,

1764
01:28:59,091 --> 01:29:01,290
we literally like,
I'll that roof for sport for a little bit,

1765
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,250
but I got to college coaching

1766
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,520
job and had the, so I met a group of
guys to mark [inaudible] at the time,

1767
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:10,140
but he ended up leaving to go to overseas
and it was probably six of us and we

1768
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:12,120
had a fight.
A guy who owned the warehouse like,

1769
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:14,910
Oh you can put Madison here and just
in the corner. You guys can just train.

1770
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,520
We didn't have to just be practice
whenever has striking practice,

1771
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:21,630
no tie practice. We really showed up
ground and pound. It would make gloves.

1772
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:25,050
We Punch each other in the face.
Why I get out sparring? No,

1773
01:29:25,051 --> 01:29:27,630
Bridget hasn't spawned. I mean you
got injured. We don't want to hear it.

1774
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,300
Just beat the shit out of each
other until it's over. There was,

1775
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:33,960
it was a horrible one at a time.
No heat.

1776
01:29:33,961 --> 01:29:38,400
We had a little bit about this big on
the corner mat and we, we in Illinois,

1777
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,580
central Illinois,
it's freezing negative twin.

1778
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:45,630
We end up fucking dudes bring
and hit the hand, hit the back,

1779
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:48,360
freeze and break their hand.
We don't have any insurance,

1780
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:51,990
US beating the shit out of each other,
but we got the opportunity for one of us,

1781
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,670
it was three 12 hours,

1782
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:55,770
but I was the only one that they was
gonna let to go shut off from a fighter.

1783
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:57,720
I had the least amount of fights,

1784
01:29:57,721 --> 01:30:01,170
but there you're the only one that could
actually work and make us look good on

1785
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:04,320
there. So you get on the ultimate
fighter and you meet Mark Henry.

1786
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:09,230
You want to win and then you go from
there. You Go and move to New Jersey.

1787
01:30:09,231 --> 01:30:12,120
Is that what you do? I went home. I had
met Ali on the show. You know what I mean?

1788
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,450
Ali was there every day.
He even said like pro wrestling this car.

1789
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:17,070
Like how are you good at wrestling?
Hanzo came on,

1790
01:30:17,071 --> 01:30:20,010
he said like you're wrestling
is key. That's when everybody
letting me know, mark,

1791
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,310
first thing he says, you're wrestling.
They made it known like rustling,

1792
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,740
it's going to run this and uh, and then
at least they're right. Then he was like,

1793
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,230
I'll work with you and the union had
to me as a manager, but I help you,

1794
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,180
like I help lead you in the
right way what you need.

1795
01:30:30,181 --> 01:30:31,830
Because I didn't have
anybody to direct me.

1796
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,530
I knew nothing been asking us the only
thing I had, but he was in Wisconsin,

1797
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:37,620
you know, I'm about out here on my
own. And Holly, I remember saying like,

1798
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:40,410
if you want to, when they're showing
the be the best you can, brother,

1799
01:30:40,411 --> 01:30:42,990
you need to go to Jersey and
mark and Matt already text me.

1800
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,660
You're more than welcome to come out and
train whenever you want. At the time,

1801
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:49,560
I had a girl who had a kid and my family
and the coaching was my dream job,

1802
01:30:49,561 --> 01:30:52,080
still my dream job. And
I loved that. You know,

1803
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:53,460
I didn't want to leave that for anything.

1804
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:58,860
You coaching wrestling at the junior
college level. And I remember, uh,

1805
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,080
that was the only made 220 bucks a week,

1806
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:03,750
but I worked other jobs to
make my dream a reality.

1807
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:07,920
That's why I want to do and fight and
I'm Holly's like if you want to be the

1808
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:10,050
best, you want to win the show,
the best opportunity you got man,

1809
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:11,280
you need to go to Jersey.

1810
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:15,150
Like I know you got guys there but even
of my guys told me after the show you

1811
01:31:15,151 --> 01:31:17,430
need to leave cause we can't do
anything for you. But I didn't want to,

1812
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:21,720
I was so grounded today. I didn't want to
leave that. That's what I knew. And uh,

1813
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:23,400
when all he said, Bro, you got to go,

1814
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,830
but I could never live in Jersey is
too fast paced. I'm a country boy.

1815
01:31:25,831 --> 01:31:28,500
I like outdoors and this
hunting and stuff like that.

1816
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:31,020
Like you need to get the Jersey
brother if you want to be the best,

1817
01:31:31,021 --> 01:31:33,870
if you don't want to be the best, stay
where you are. I remember telling my mom,

1818
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:35,010
like I said,
I need to go to Jersey.

1819
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:38,150
I'm mom said when I was in high
school my senior year, she said,

1820
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:42,360
you get the opportunity ever to leave.
I want you to go far away.

1821
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:43,830
Did you think about going anywhere else?

1822
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:47,060
Like go on the roof of sport permanently
or, and that was a thought? Yeah,

1823
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,500
I thought, but he didn't
have the rest have been, but
that was about it. You know,

1824
01:31:49,501 --> 01:31:52,260
I'm a wrestling base and I fell in love
with the way Frankie and I'm trained.

1825
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:56,070
I loved that I was looking for something
like that. Mark Fiori had that,

1826
01:31:56,071 --> 01:32:00,260
but when he left, had nowhere else to
go. I was thinking and my mom said,

1827
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,490
that's what the best is. You need to go
be the best. And all my brother was like,

1828
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:04,180
Yo,

1829
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:08,410
let's go Mark Henry such unique guy that
when when people start training with

1830
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:11,820
him and realizing like what he is and
then comparing them to other people,

1831
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:16,960
it makes them think like, wow, this
guy's got something very unique.

1832
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:21,150
Like all of what you're talking
about is systems and all this.

1833
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,100
The stuff that he writes in the notes
and like Brendan Schaub was telling me

1834
01:32:24,101 --> 01:32:26,920
that he trained with him for one fight
and he said when he went down there,

1835
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:30,220
he said like, it looks like, oh
look, an eye opening experience.

1836
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,800
Like he didn't know that a
coach could be that good.

1837
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:36,290
Yeah. And you know, it's crazy part, the
reason why mark isn't known the most.

1838
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:37,590
Cause you're like Freddie Roach.

1839
01:32:37,591 --> 01:32:41,860
She got Duke Roufus all these big
game named guys. Um, what's, uh,

1840
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:46,400
the guy hard knocks three 65 or Kamora
who? Smith, what's the coach's name?

1841
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:51,090
Uh, Henri Hooft. Hendry
who if they always got it,

1842
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:53,720
but that's all they do throughout the day.

1843
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:57,890
So you see them because they work with
so many fighters and it's like that's all

1844
01:32:57,891 --> 01:33:00,920
they do is coach them. And May,
you know, mark has a pizza man.

1845
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:03,930
When I first got it and they said that
I didn't know he had them own a pizzeria

1846
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:05,850
and he's just say after respond,

1847
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:08,570
like I ain't got time to go make the
dough five minutes to go to a job,

1848
01:33:08,571 --> 01:33:12,620
make money. Right. Yeah. And then his
older pieces of pizzeria and that's his,

1849
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:15,460
that's his passion. Like when
practice is over, it needs to,

1850
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:19,250
we just start at nine 30 I need to be
out of my shot by 11 and then I got to

1851
01:33:19,251 --> 01:33:22,910
work with this guy at four 30 or
five so he just missed twice a day.

1852
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:26,750
You got seven o'clock in the morning
or four o'clock in the afternoon,

1853
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:29,840
but through today he's at the pizzeria.
That's his baby.

1854
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:32,120
His father in law gave that to him.
He's passionate about,

1855
01:33:32,121 --> 01:33:34,490
he loves it that his
whole families and he,

1856
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:36,140
you go there and you'll
see the family bond.

1857
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,730
He treats all his employees like family.

1858
01:33:37,731 --> 01:33:42,290
That's his dream is you got to respect
that because he doesn't miss work because

1859
01:33:42,291 --> 01:33:45,350
of this. Even with my fights,
whatever, he'd come out Thursday,

1860
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:46,520
like I gotta be at the pizzeria all week,

1861
01:33:46,521 --> 01:33:48,410
but I'll be there Thursday
night or Friday morning.

1862
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,500
Sometimes they show up Saturday
fight that I got a catering job.

1863
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:52,321
I can't make your bro,

1864
01:33:52,321 --> 01:33:54,920
but I'm a video chats you and
tell you what we need to work on,

1865
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,590
videotape this workout with such and
such and I'll tell you what we need to

1866
01:33:57,591 --> 01:33:58,190
tighten up.

1867
01:33:58,190 --> 01:34:00,770
And I beat her Saturday morning or Friday
night and we were working as much as

1868
01:34:00,771 --> 01:34:03,390
we can before the fight. I was like
a character in a movie. Exactly.

1869
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:07,220
And the fact that he's that passionate
about that and the MMA and I remember

1870
01:34:07,221 --> 01:34:11,030
driving with him to one of our amateur
guys fights. He's driving Washington.

1871
01:34:11,031 --> 01:34:13,130
Felt like coach you watching
the road or you watch it?

1872
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:16,520
Like I got to wash this girl's fight
cause uh, we got Katelyn Juke Kagan,

1873
01:34:16,521 --> 01:34:19,940
one of her my fights while
he fights while driving,

1874
01:34:19,941 --> 01:34:24,320
he gave him a piece of paper and a pen
and take this down. Like what? He's like,

1875
01:34:24,321 --> 01:34:27,230
I need you to write this down for me.
This is what I need. So He's driving,

1876
01:34:27,231 --> 01:34:30,080
watching film and he started calling out
stuff. I'm writing it down. He's like,

1877
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:31,790
God, that's the stuff I need
to remember for a fight.

1878
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:35,240
But he doesn't have the time. Most guys
have to sit and do that through the day.

1879
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:39,560
He picked me up from the piece of
real change and we hit the road.

1880
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:43,910
So he's like breaking film and you see
somebody so passionate that can do the

1881
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:47,420
things he does and he got so many
fighters. Like you say what the codes.

1882
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:51,380
We got the Russians, we got the
resilience and you got us and everybody,

1883
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,180
the Russians,
their stuff is in Russian.

1884
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:55,880
That mean this guy is taking time to
learn rush. You're going to the basement.

1885
01:34:55,881 --> 01:34:59,900
He has like translation watts. Yes,
that he understands Russia now.

1886
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:02,360
So he write down what does he learned?
Russian,

1887
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,610
he learns Russian just to
help these guys with stuff.

1888
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:07,790
Jesus here likes to hear responding about
how that show over there some how to

1889
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:10,340
chose what's that and here
like what I mean very good.

1890
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:14,840
Like what the why the resilience hauling
the and that was he using like Rosetta

1891
01:35:14,841 --> 01:35:18,620
stone and he just have, like I said,
they write it down what this mean,

1892
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:22,610
like basic stuff and they write down
how you say it in Russian. Oh Wow.

1893
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:27,470
Mark is up. He's a mad scientist.
He got so many things going on.

1894
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:31,100
He can't remember the direction you're
going in and you'd be driving. He's like,

1895
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:34,190
ah, what am I going? But
when it comes to colts,

1896
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:37,050
he knows all 10 to 12 fighters.

1897
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:40,200
Every co in everybody has a different
language in different names.

1898
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,530
Is named after our family or your dog
or something happened. We was a kid.

1899
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:47,400
Everything revolves around
something that happened and he,

1900
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:51,330
every fighter has different coats.
He knows everybody's,

1901
01:35:51,690 --> 01:35:55,880
we line up for rounds at the Nica
tones in the cage. He's in occasion.

1902
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:59,970
Frankie Marlin come in now I saw a
Portuguese, then Caitlin come in.

1903
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:04,950
Then it's all stuff related to her. Then
I come in how to speak Portuguese. Yes,

1904
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:09,660
he has Eric codes in
Portuguese, everything and
mark is a wizard. Like I said,

1905
01:36:09,661 --> 01:36:11,040
when I say he's a mad scientist,

1906
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,920
you don't know any other coaches that
take the time to learn and stuff that he

1907
01:36:13,921 --> 01:36:18,000
does to make his fighters the best.
He ain't worried about that.

1908
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:21,570
He wants to win and all that,
but he wanted to make sure we are in sync.

1909
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:24,420
We indicates we talking,
it's a foreign language.

1910
01:36:24,421 --> 01:36:27,450
Like that's why I'm the global
fight you here. Uh, Dan Hardy,

1911
01:36:27,451 --> 01:36:29,490
one of them say like there's no point
in turning the corners corner cause we

1912
01:36:29,491 --> 01:36:33,690
don't know where to saying everything.
And like three fights later,

1913
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:36,060
I won't even know what he said cause
we didn't have been to so many coats.

1914
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:38,070
I got to go back and think
like what was that again?

1915
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:41,130
Did you ever get to a point where he's
yelling something out and you don't know

1916
01:36:41,131 --> 01:36:43,680
what the code is? No,
no cause muscle memory.

1917
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:48,740
Because when we hit pads is never a one
two across like what would you say it's

1918
01:36:49,691 --> 01:36:53,100
not one to like what would it be if
it's some important cause like uh,

1919
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:56,910
like for you one would be like,
I'm trying to think of only an old one.

1920
01:36:57,090 --> 01:37:00,870
So I'm trying to think, uh, sync, sync.

1921
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:03,360
That's,
I can't read what language it was,

1922
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:07,250
but I think that was a hooker or whatever.
I can think and not us thing.

1923
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:11,780
But that was how you say it
in their language. Oh, but
what about for you? Like,

1924
01:37:11,781 --> 01:37:12,620
what's that weird like?

1925
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:15,470
He would give you like posting different
language Friday and went through

1926
01:37:15,471 --> 01:37:20,420
everything in English. Now we're gonna
switch it up. Still working on Russia now.

1927
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:23,360
Last time I was working in a rush and
stuff so it's Kinda like he was giving you

1928
01:37:23,361 --> 01:37:26,030
Russian coach. I was like, I'm
learning too. You know what I'm saying?

1929
01:37:26,031 --> 01:37:27,170
Like I said pretty how to show.

1930
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:30,080
I know that me and very good now it
certain things you say to them and you

1931
01:37:30,081 --> 01:37:33,800
figure it out. That's so crazy. So
what, what is this logic behind that?

1932
01:37:33,801 --> 01:37:36,890
He doesn't want anybody learning the
codes. Just keep you on your toes,

1933
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:40,050
keep you on your toes, keep your
all. He never skin comfortable.

1934
01:37:40,051 --> 01:37:43,430
One thing cause you get into a habit,
one habit.

1935
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:45,970
How are you going to get condoms or
God knows what the eyes close, right?

1936
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:49,350
You always gotta learn something new.
It keeps you hungry. Like my friend,

1937
01:37:49,351 --> 01:37:50,440
he used to make me come over ice,

1938
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:53,400
do mitts on Friday night and
then we'd go to the movies.

1939
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:56,400
But we do mix from four to five
30 when I first was learning,

1940
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,640
he would make me sit a table. He showered,
I showered, whatever. He goes shot.

1941
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:03,000
I had to study my coats and when it
come down he'd be watching TV, whatever.

1942
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:06,300
He'd be in the kitchen. He take
the paper from me, he says I'm out,

1943
01:38:06,301 --> 01:38:10,080
and I had to tell him what it meant. Like
one, two, once you left, kick, whatever.

1944
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:13,290
So he would say whatever the code was
and I had to know it. I messed it up.

1945
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:15,920
He bring notepad back.
I keep studying and I was like,

1946
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:19,130
like he take you in like that now.
He took me in like a son.

1947
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:22,560
I'm 12 hours from home. He could dog
me out. I could have just been there.

1948
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:26,640
What does this, Jamie, is that corner
transcript from Eddie's fight. Okay,

1949
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:30,990
let us some codes. Yes. 73
on the knees. 73 on the knee.

1950
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:35,760
73 on the knee. You're too much
in the front. You too much. Yeah.

1951
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:41,130
Chain chain, chain chain.
Hands Up, Chin down.

1952
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:44,370
What could be changed? Take downs
together. It could be anything.

1953
01:38:44,371 --> 01:38:48,060
It could be anything. Yeah. No, no.
Is Change. Change, change and down.

1954
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:51,570
They ain't take her. He told him something
for standing as the stand in code.

1955
01:38:51,571 --> 01:38:55,560
Like you can send out three with the
fucking 73 he keeps saying 73 what does

1956
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:59,520
that mean? I couldn't 73 that could be
anything for Eddie because Eddie don't,

1957
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:00,470
let's see.
Some people,

1958
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:05,480
only six to 26 73 like I said,

1959
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:10,330
weird. He's so he's got numbers for
him. I mean we all got numbers. Yeah,

1960
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:14,910
we all have numbers. But if you do want
a coat once a combo, he makes it a comb.

1961
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:18,480
It was a single thing he would say,
but it's not the number normal one,

1962
01:39:18,481 --> 01:39:22,140
two or it might be sink or if it's a,
what's another?

1963
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:26,580
He said he gave me Croatian
once. Correlation. Yeah,

1964
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:30,810
that took me forever. I don't know this,
but just like Russia. It's tech and now,

1965
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:33,960
but it's like you don't know it but
she learned that. Let me ask you this.

1966
01:39:33,961 --> 01:39:35,970
So say if you got a fight scheduled now,

1967
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:39,810
so someone UFC calls you up and they say,
hey Corey, we got another one for you.

1968
01:39:39,811 --> 01:39:40,950
It's an eight weeks with this guy.

1969
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:43,970
So that's when you'll start
learning the newest codes.

1970
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,620
We've worked codes right away off
the last fight. He said we can,

1971
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:48,300
we sit down and watch
the fight and we hear it.

1972
01:39:48,301 --> 01:39:51,810
We call so and we see how we're
reacting to it. After that fight,

1973
01:39:51,811 --> 01:39:54,450
then you go to a new code.
We worked in new stuff right away.

1974
01:39:54,451 --> 01:39:57,300
As soon as you start tracking
new code already changed it up.

1975
01:39:57,301 --> 01:39:58,890
So when it's time to get in the camp,
that's the thing.

1976
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:00,810
It's like people that don't
stay in the gym after a fight,

1977
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:03,540
when they first get in, can't we spend
the first half of camp getting in shape?

1978
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,450
Right? Same thing. So if
we don't have the codes,

1979
01:40:06,451 --> 01:40:09,570
then we have to first spend the first
four or five weeks just trying to

1980
01:40:09,571 --> 01:40:12,690
understand each other.
I'm not really hitting past comments up.

1981
01:40:12,691 --> 01:40:15,930
He'll say something and I throw a cross
when he made a hook or I throw a kick,

1982
01:40:15,931 --> 01:40:16,620
you know,
what are you doing?

1983
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:20,580
I was a jail like I don't know what we
spend that first time just shadowboxing

1984
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:22,980
cost, figuring out, figuring
it out for a few weeks.

1985
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:25,770
We watched him film together and we go
back like you see how you did it when you

1986
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:27,720
did this one when it was this language.
That's it.

1987
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:31,530
This is in that language so it's
just like study hall in College.

1988
01:40:31,531 --> 01:40:35,220
You figuring it out and he has codes for
football, footwork as well. Everything.

1989
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:39,240
Everything. Every, you would never hear
him. You will never hear him say shot.

1990
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:40,830
You're in every home.
Say Jack,

1991
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:45,930
you're an airy him say head movement and
so it's all in different languages and

1992
01:40:45,931 --> 01:40:48,990
where did he learn all this from?
His own system than the camera ass.

1993
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:53,320
I never asked. That's why I
don't ask questions. I just
do it. That's smart. Smart.

1994
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,010
If you talked

1995
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,470
to Brennan Shop,
shop shop was blown away by it.

1996
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:57,910
It's like I've never
seen anything like it.

1997
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:01,390
Rashad Evans said the same thing
came down when he fought Sam Alvey.

1998
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:04,870
I remember that can't, and we linked
up and trained after he hit like Bro,

1999
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:07,790
he said, I don't even know if
I've been, if I even did there,

2000
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,900
I won the world championship.
But mark make it feel like I'm a rookie.

2001
01:41:10,901 --> 01:41:12,560
Like I don't know what I'm
doing. Well, you're talking to,

2002
01:41:12,561 --> 01:41:15,220
he said he was saying codes and I
was like doing everything wrong.

2003
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:18,550
And in my mind it's kind of like you
start doubting yourself because you can't

2004
01:41:18,551 --> 01:41:21,280
get it right. But by the end of
it, you do it so much. Like I said,

2005
01:41:21,281 --> 01:41:22,800
it's tandem dance.
Well,

2006
01:41:22,801 --> 01:41:26,920
there's something about guys who take
things to a totally new level and that's

2007
01:41:26,921 --> 01:41:31,510
what he seems to do, you know, with his
coaching, he loves it. And he can tell,

2008
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:34,360
you could tell, you could tell the
way he treats fighters, the way he,

2009
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:37,240
the way it corners
fighters. And you know, man,

2010
01:41:37,241 --> 01:41:39,690
you guys got a fucking incredible
camp right now. I mean,

2011
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:44,490
everybody saying we've got a team, we've
got a family, and for the July when the,

2012
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,750
you know everyone's going to
be on four July Mark's house.

2013
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:49,210
Everybody's in fighting.
If you've been there and train with us,

2014
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:52,090
you get an invite. Hey Bro,
if you had that weekend,

2015
01:41:52,091 --> 01:41:54,880
the week before next week four is your
lie. We're doing a big party in my house.

2016
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:58,200
Come on, Bro. I got to go back to such
and such. Well, you can make it back, bro.

2017
01:41:58,270 --> 01:41:59,950
Open fight.
You're more than welcome to come hang out.

2018
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:03,010
We'd love to have you there. You know,
I remember when I was in Wisconsin,

2019
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:07,870
like we hung out with Anthony Pettis and
Duke Roufus and all those Ufc guys that

2020
01:42:07,871 --> 01:42:10,360
in the gym, but I don't ever
remember seeing them outside.

2021
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,490
Like we say in the fight I was,
I'd never seen him outside of the gym.

2022
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,170
It's not that way in a house.

2023
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,970
Like I was talking to Frankie last weekend
was all eating or something or when

2024
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:20,900
it was finished training, stretching. He
said something about a party. I'm like,

2025
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:22,960
I still ain't never been invited
here. New Year's parties. Like, Bro,

2026
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:26,500
it's always open and like everybody's
invited to my house. You just never came.

2027
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:28,210
I was like, oh. He's like,
you know where I live?

2028
01:42:28,211 --> 01:42:31,180
Your wife over my house all the time.
You just never came. It's always open.

2029
01:42:31,181 --> 01:42:34,780
It was like you like, we know
where each other live. You know,

2030
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:37,360
I had my weight and invite everybody over.
Everybody show up.

2031
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:39,070
So how did he get in
touch with the Russians?

2032
01:42:39,071 --> 01:42:43,450
Like how does the beat get over there?
I think what Ali. Ah, that makes sense.

2033
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:45,700
I mean most of our guys
come from a highly,

2034
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:49,330
I think everybody on the team is managed
by Eileen now set for a blind fighter.

2035
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:52,990
But like I say, except for who?
Caitlin's you Kagan. I'm a fighter.

2036
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:55,320
But you call her blind father. That's
her name. That's her mom fighter.

2037
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:58,540
Casey killer. Casey. I call
him cause he's ruthless.

2038
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,950
She has received little pretty good.

2039
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:04,600
Then I've seen it like not guys out at
times in the gym really multiple times.

2040
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:10,600
I'm very interested in Marlin, Marlin
Mariah's versus Henry the birthday boy.

2041
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:14,200
Happy Birthday Marlin. Today's
birthdays, birthday. Happy Birthday. Mom.

2042
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:15,880
Even though it's on speaker night.

2043
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:18,280
He was one of those guys when he was
fighting for world series of fighting.

2044
01:43:18,281 --> 01:43:21,460
I was very interested in him
coming over to the UFC. I was like,

2045
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:25,120
this guy's got legit skills,
something special. And he would,

2046
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:29,950
he was smashing people, but it wasn't,
it wasn't, he wasn't crushing cans.

2047
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:33,760
He was beating real good guys and the
way he was moving and the things he was

2048
01:43:33,761 --> 01:43:36,190
doing, I was like, this
guy's world class. Yeah.

2049
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:39,520
I took Tamale and on the shelf he was
the one that helped me understand the way

2050
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:44,150
the pro with the manager and the
payments. And I didn't, I had nice,

2051
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:48,170
I knew nothing. Like I said, I was in the
gym. He taught me to hide stuff, work.

2052
01:43:48,171 --> 01:43:51,100
We sit in a sauna and he was telling
him about Ali. It's like, oh bro,

2053
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,390
he's a good guy. Cause I
wasn't, I didn't know this guy.

2054
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:55,790
Well I'll help you out this and this.
And I asked them like,

2055
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:57,800
what'd you think about Eileen? So
he's my man, he's great brother.

2056
01:43:57,810 --> 01:43:58,760
This isness you know,

2057
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,340
here's the way it works cause you get
your purse and you break a certain

2058
01:44:01,341 --> 01:44:04,790
percentage off. These people take the
percentage and then we've got the camp.

2059
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:04,941
This,

2060
01:44:04,941 --> 01:44:08,270
he was bringing me to how their camp work
before I was coming out there so I had

2061
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:11,070
an understanding like how
to get paid like you, you,

2062
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:14,540
they going to offer you is if you get
to UFC at first sight off 10 and 10 or

2063
01:44:14,541 --> 01:44:16,840
this organization is this and this.
Here's time.

2064
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:19,660
Like you just can't let people take
advantage of things I didn't know. Right.

2065
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:24,710
You know, cause Marlin was just a super
friendly, he's a nice guy, family guy.

2066
01:44:24,711 --> 01:44:25,501
Like now I,

2067
01:44:25,501 --> 01:44:28,100
if I went home right now I'm sure him and
his wife might be able to with my wife

2068
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:30,050
and the baby just hanging out
with the puppy. They just,

2069
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:33,650
we just a tight knit family like that.
He just looks awesome bro.

2070
01:44:33,651 --> 01:44:36,230
What's going on with you in a fight? Like
I heard this, I heard that, I saw this,

2071
01:44:36,231 --> 01:44:38,510
I saw that. Don't let people
get to you. This isn't this.

2072
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:40,010
Don't let them talk you into doing this.

2073
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:42,910
Don't let somebody get to you where you
react like this. Keep your head brother.

2074
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,830
They're like, you're good. You're going
to be the champ. But I've seen you train.

2075
01:44:45,831 --> 01:44:48,910
I know what you do. I know what you're
capable of. You're, you're the good,

2076
01:44:48,911 --> 01:44:52,520
you're translating so well from
what you were to where you are now.

2077
01:44:52,890 --> 01:44:56,190
So having to, like I said that he's
one of my, him and Frankie Eggo,

2078
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:59,960
Frankie Edgar and my two mentors
in the fight game, you know,

2079
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:03,110
couldn't get two better mentor. I need a
question from Amy. Got, I've messaged him.

2080
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,570
And then you got Eddie Alvarez as well.

2081
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:08,870
I don't see Eddie as much as heat mat
comes up like three, four times a week.

2082
01:45:08,871 --> 01:45:12,670
But I see Frankie and Marlin every day.
How does any like being over at one FC?

2083
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:15,650
I think they treat, I never
asked him about, you know,

2084
01:45:15,651 --> 01:45:18,050
I'm not the type to ask questions. I don't
like being in other people's business.

2085
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:20,360
So I don't ask, what do you think
about this way? You think about that?

2086
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:24,040
He told me when he came back, uh, from his
first trip, he's like, bro, it's crazy.

2087
01:45:24,041 --> 01:45:27,950
They treated me like king it. What do you
mean? He was like, uh, me and Jamie flood.

2088
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:30,110
They're like, yeah, that plane I
was on look nice. Like Yeah Bro,

2089
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:34,040
32,000 something for a ticket. And I
was like, what? Damn, that's crazy.

2090
01:45:34,041 --> 01:45:38,310
Like that's each 82,000.
I'm like that for,

2091
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:41,140
it was like some Asian airline
first class and he like,

2092
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:44,480
and they gave us like steaks and how it
was amazing. It was great. It was good.

2093
01:45:44,481 --> 01:45:47,430
And that's all I ever heard.
All I hear is good things. Yeah.

2094
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:49,790
All here's good things about
the way they treat the fighters,

2095
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:53,930
the mentality the shot tree has and
the way he runs the organization. Very,

2096
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:57,080
very impressed. Like I said, it's an up
and coming. I'm glad it's doing well.

2097
01:45:57,081 --> 01:45:59,540
When it first started to say,
oh, it's not going to be around,

2098
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:00,800
they're not going to have backers.

2099
01:46:00,801 --> 01:46:02,870
They throwing too much money
right in the get go in the way.

2100
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:08,260
But now here we are six years later when
they started doing or bigger worldwide,

2101
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:12,430
I mean, they're gigantic and
people making money like, Hey,

2102
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:17,050
I know he was telling one of our teammates
that wasn't a PFL turning at 85 but

2103
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:19,820
not doing 85 this year. He's like, what
am I gonna do now? I heard Eddie say,

2104
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:22,940
I mean, I can have my guy I talked to
you, we can try and get you a new one.

2105
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,860
And I heard him saying like, Bro, he told
me I can make some good money over it.

2106
01:46:25,861 --> 01:46:29,060
I'm trying to do that. Hey gotta
worry about you and your family, Bro.

2107
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:32,300
Do what's best for you and
yours. So well, I mean worldwide,

2108
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:37,010
I think they're on a collision course
with the UFC in terms of like notoriety

2109
01:46:37,011 --> 01:46:41,480
and popularity in Asia. It's already
bigger. You know, it's, it's something,

2110
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,070
it's something special.
And you know,

2111
01:46:43,071 --> 01:46:46,730
you see what the guy that that knots
you can God that uh, Eddie fought,

2112
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:50,070
they have world class fighters and
those are, that's a world. I mean

2113
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:54,030
you knock on Eddie Alvarez, you're a world
class fighter and a first round. Yeah,

2114
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:56,940
yeah. Very impressive. And the, even
the guy that mighty mouse fought,

2115
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:00,810
he gave him trouble guys good. You
know, they got good fighters over there.

2116
01:47:00,811 --> 01:47:04,480
Real world class fighters. There's
so many good fighters now. You know.

2117
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,400
And then also they have, you know,
yachts and Clive's fighting over there.

2118
01:47:08,401 --> 01:47:13,260
Nicky hold skin, they got
worldclass kickboxers envoy,
tie fighters fighting in.

2119
01:47:13,261 --> 01:47:15,330
And then even there,
even doing grappling matches.

2120
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:18,170
I mean I love what they're doing together.

2121
01:47:18,410 --> 01:47:21,420
Well that's all I did the kickboxing,
MMA but now,

2122
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:26,100
and it had two different rings for but
wanting to do it all in one on one night

2123
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:29,130
as I knew I made a now's the kickbox and
I ain't got grappling and going back,

2124
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:31,560
it's cool to keep you on your toes.
The only thing I don't like,

2125
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:33,270
cause I was the earliest
fucking tomorrow morning,

2126
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:36,140
right? Like two, three o'clock. I
set an alarm to get up to see it.

2127
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:41,780
You gotta take the good with Singapore
or wherever they are in different

2128
01:47:41,781 --> 01:47:43,610
countries, whatever they,
they hold their events.

2129
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:46,730
I just think it's so important for
fighters to have options to have so many

2130
01:47:46,731 --> 01:47:48,230
different places to have Bella tour.

2131
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:52,040
And you know now that like Rory
McDonald been over the bell at tour and

2132
01:47:52,041 --> 01:47:53,700
kindergarten was saucy and you know,

2133
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,580
world class guys and Ryan Bader
as a heavyweights, a beast.

2134
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:02,180
Crazy. See, knock out fade or that
first round you're like, what the fuck?

2135
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:05,990
Amazing doing his thing.
I'm happy formal Davis.

2136
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:10,350
I'm just happy to see that
fighters have options. UFC yeah,

2137
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:12,680
it's good for the UFC.
It's good for everybody.

2138
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:14,360
For Mine, people say, I say,

2139
01:48:14,361 --> 01:48:18,340
Oh did you ever think about going below
two oh one and my mind is great fighters

2140
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:23,030
everywhere right now. I still think the
number one and all of his in the UFC,

2141
01:48:23,210 --> 01:48:28,010
number one martial arts in USC and right
now that's my goal. That's all great.

2142
01:48:28,011 --> 01:48:30,290
But I'm here to be the best.
I can go to one and make a killing.

2143
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:32,270
I can go to belch and
get my sponsors back.

2144
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:35,840
But I'm in no rush to leave here
because I want to be the best.

2145
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:39,050
Like after I proved that there was
nothing else, and then it's like, okay,

2146
01:48:39,051 --> 01:48:41,090
now I'm ready for the money,
then that's maybe an option.

2147
01:48:41,091 --> 01:48:44,960
But there's no confidence in terms
of prestige. There's no context.

2148
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:48,980
If you get the UFC title, you're the best.
That's it. There's no question like, oh,

2149
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:52,040
what about the ability for this, this
and this? Because the Bella to a chimp,

2150
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,950
Wellesley, Jon Jones,
and especially on one

2151
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:56,210
and your division,

2152
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:59,120
you know in your division you have
one of the best guys of all time,

2153
01:48:59,150 --> 01:49:03,470
if not the best guy of all time champion.
So when you see a guy like John

2154
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:07,070
at the top of the heap,
is that,

2155
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:12,270
is that motivating to you to just ramp
up and even harder because you realize

2156
01:49:12,271 --> 01:49:15,860
that the guy who is a champion of your
division is not just the best light

2157
01:49:15,861 --> 01:49:18,950
heavyweight of all time.
Maybe the best martial artist of all time.

2158
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:23,130
There ramps up so much like I,
well I'm riding the bike in my basement.

2159
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,520
I got the airdyne bike and a stationary
bike and I got the project and I'm down

2160
01:49:26,521 --> 01:49:29,190
there. The only thing on fight
pass and I'm watching a fight pass.

2161
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:30,600
I'm usually watching Jon Jones,

2162
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:33,360
you know to see him dominate other
guys and that you just hear that bite.

2163
01:49:33,361 --> 01:49:34,194
You can hear the,

2164
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:37,170
the pedals are pretty old head getting
until I can give them raw some crazy and

2165
01:49:37,171 --> 01:49:40,050
like I don't even be looking down the
clock where I can just hear her, the air,

2166
01:49:40,060 --> 01:49:41,230
the fan picking up right now.

2167
01:49:41,231 --> 01:49:44,760
I didn't realize it till like it goes
a break and I slow it down and a heart

2168
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:48,100
race and I was just watching
them just like, like

2169
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:50,890
if I want to get to, I got to, I
got to beat him to be the best.

2170
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,950
I need to work hard.
What's your take on him?

2171
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:56,380
You can't take away what
he does in the sport.

2172
01:49:56,710 --> 01:50:00,670
What does his outside his personal
life, that's all he say. She say,

2173
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:03,190
I have my words after
the California stuff,

2174
01:50:03,191 --> 01:50:04,910
we went to two 26 or whatever it fight.

2175
01:50:04,911 --> 01:50:09,390
It was in Vegas and got moved here because
his lifestyle and drug tests and all

2176
01:50:09,391 --> 01:50:12,640
the extra stuff, however you want
to code it up, his past, you know,

2177
01:50:12,641 --> 01:50:14,860
I'm done with it.
I had my words there,

2178
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:17,590
the fact he kept using
God and Jesus and this,

2179
01:50:17,591 --> 01:50:20,830
this and this and I'm a god fearing guy
who read my Bible every morning and I

2180
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:23,750
don't like the fact that you can,
that he would do that. And I'm like,

2181
01:50:23,751 --> 01:50:24,490
I said I want it now.

2182
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:28,240
But at the time my words was the fact
that he did that and then at the same time

2183
01:50:28,241 --> 01:50:30,170
I want to interview and so I
want to thank God and it's,

2184
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:31,420
that kind of rubbed me wrong.

2185
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:33,790
And then we flew on a plane
together and like I said,

2186
01:50:33,791 --> 01:50:36,280
I saw the way he was acting
when he came on a plane.

2187
01:50:36,281 --> 01:50:37,540
Like we not doing this because of him,

2188
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:41,010
like all that at a time bothering me
and I was a pent up anyone else on mills

2189
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:42,040
going into that fight?

2190
01:50:42,041 --> 01:50:45,940
That was something on my shoulders because
I had posted something cause when a

2191
01:50:45,941 --> 01:50:48,070
UFC called me right before I got
on the flight, they were like, oh,

2192
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:52,120
don't come all the way to Vegas now I
got my wife, she's eight months pregnant,

2193
01:50:52,121 --> 01:50:55,600
like she's 30 weeks, whatever. She can't
travel after this. She's struggling.

2194
01:50:55,601 --> 01:50:58,870
We all them bags and y'all call me and
I'll say, don't come this and this.

2195
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:01,300
Go back home. We're gonna fly you out
again. Like I'm not doing this again.

2196
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:04,270
And then when they get to the, well we
can get you here but we get you to Cali,

2197
01:51:04,271 --> 01:51:06,850
but we can't take your wife.
Like what? Like, well you,

2198
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:08,800
we pay your ticket and
coach ticket like no,

2199
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:12,770
fuck that all because Jon Jones is that,
that's what got me mad though.

2200
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:16,030
So they were trying to save money,
not flying people because we was,

2201
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:20,080
we was literally walking down the runway
to the plane when they call him the

2202
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:22,390
cheese, can I turn around? But
then when we got like, okay,

2203
01:51:22,391 --> 01:51:25,000
you come here but we can get you to Cali,
but we couldn't get your,

2204
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:28,120
your wife to Cali.
Like my wife is 30 weeks pregnant.

2205
01:51:28,121 --> 01:51:29,620
She's here when she's coming like,

2206
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:32,440
well we don't know what to do because
you bought her ticket, isn't it?

2207
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,720
Like what do you mean you don't know
what to do? Get her nose ticket.

2208
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:37,420
Like I pay with my family. What about
the people that's on the way right now?

2209
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:42,010
Like all they gotta find their own way
and that made me weak fight week of the

2210
01:51:42,011 --> 01:51:44,200
fight. The thing of the things
that you have to think about,

2211
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:45,190
you know fucking with,

2212
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:49,210
that's the last thing I was worried
about and then I get there and they said,

2213
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,650
when you get, make sure you got your
workout if you don't have your work.

2214
01:51:51,651 --> 01:51:55,300
I scheduled the pie set already.
As soon as you get there, go do it.

2215
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:59,230
I did mine like a month and a half
ahead of time. I'm all, I'm like I said,

2216
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:03,120
I'm puncturing. Like I like having stuff
done. I'm getting ready to go to Pei.

2217
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:07,360
I'm packing my bags and I get a call.
Oh, you can't come to the pie. Why?

2218
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:10,270
John just came in and said he went to
work out so we closed the gym down.

2219
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:13,120
You're not allowed.
Y'all called me two months ago,

2220
01:52:13,121 --> 01:52:15,490
told me to set my schedule
to come ahead of time.

2221
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:19,270
I'm really getting ready to walk to my
Uber that's outside and you say I can't

2222
01:52:19,271 --> 01:52:21,490
come now like a, sorry.
Nothing we can do as John.

2223
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:25,960
Why can't you work out at the same place
with John's work and did the same thing

2224
01:52:25,961 --> 01:52:28,330
when kindness there and I'm there
in the summer and kind of show up.

2225
01:52:28,331 --> 01:52:31,690
They come into there but you got to
leave like what? Just wrote really?

2226
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:34,890
You're all getting condoms. Have his car
parked up on the sidewalk. Come on. Yeah,

2227
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:37,330
they have security guards block
the stairs off and everything.

2228
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:42,860
Tello. Yes, exactly.

2229
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,070
You walk out and like it hurts
somebody saying big place. Yeah.

2230
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,620
But you can go to the
cardio room and the waste,

2231
01:52:48,621 --> 01:52:51,380
but you can't use the upstairs with
the cage in the bag and stuff is,

2232
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:55,820
you can't use them if he's in the
cafeteria there. So you can't go up there.

2233
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:59,720
Oh fuck. Is that about acid jazz
to people? I don't know my piece.

2234
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:04,250
I'm an independent contractor
sir. But yeah, like that stuff,

2235
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:08,330
it kind of rubbed me wrong and
that's when it was kinda like,

2236
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:10,340
if I was a champ I wouldn't want that.

2237
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:15,880
I want people to be at to see what I'm
doing in security. I don't know. You know,

2238
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:18,740
you got to think about how much
death threats that guy must get,

2239
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:23,480
how much shit he must take. You know, he's
as popular as he is, as famous as he is.

2240
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:26,870
Maybe just has overzealous security maybe.
And they just want to tighten it down.

2241
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:28,700
So they didn't want anybody up there.
They kept,

2242
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:31,940
I was so that was the first time
I've ever cursed at a UFC employee.

2243
01:53:33,410 --> 01:53:37,010
I was Kurt like going off like y'all been
bugging me to change my whole workout

2244
01:53:37,011 --> 01:53:40,160
schedule. Fight Week. I'm cutting weight
too. You know, like it's not just John.

2245
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,830
Yeah, like we understand of it. I don't
give a fuck about of I don't care.

2246
01:53:42,831 --> 01:53:44,230
What are you doing?
I need to go up there and get a workout.

2247
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:47,060
My coaches meeting me there from the
airport but we can't do anything about it.

2248
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,890
Korea and the guy kept hanging
up because I was going on.

2249
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:51,040
That is when they called
her back and I was like, Yo,

2250
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:53,480
and then people would hit me up like
I'm glad you actually voicing yourself.

2251
01:53:53,570 --> 01:53:54,990
I'm hearing around the PR now,

2252
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:57,260
everybody talking about how you're
mad and somebody texted like,

2253
01:53:57,261 --> 01:53:59,540
I'm glad you were actually speaking out
because everybody else kind of like,

2254
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:03,380
okay, like no. Like, okay. Then if
it wasn't for my wife being there,

2255
01:54:03,381 --> 01:54:04,420
I probably went checked.
You're saying,

2256
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:08,180
but I see the way she's struggling and
carry this belly around and she's hurt

2257
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:13,400
eight months. She just give birth
at any time. So the stresses,

2258
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:15,840
I'm sure it's like all
that and my baby's milk,

2259
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:20,560
it was revved me up and my wife can't
like Cory, just stop, calm down.

2260
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:21,141
It'll be okay.

2261
01:54:21,141 --> 01:54:24,260
This isn't this like the fact of being
okay as the fact that they led in one

2262
01:54:24,261 --> 01:54:29,090
person dictate at all. Like we're all
equal and I treated it like a number.

2263
01:54:29,091 --> 01:54:33,560
He's Jon Jones but we're number
4,722 right. You know what I mean?

2264
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:36,950
I don't like that he's John. I'm
core. Like I was telling them,

2265
01:54:36,951 --> 01:54:37,700
we all know right here reason.

2266
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:41,150
I love rose number units cause I've never
seen her that from her. She's a champ.

2267
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:45,040
But you would see her and she act just
like rose before when she was in Invictus

2268
01:54:45,041 --> 01:54:46,070
did.
She hasn't changed.

2269
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:50,180
I don't want no special treatment from
her or from anybody. If I was a champ,

2270
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:54,470
treat me the same. You know what I mean
is some people are different. Like I said,

2271
01:54:54,471 --> 01:54:58,310
I don't know if it's John or his camp
that was doing that or UFC is doing or

2272
01:54:58,600 --> 01:54:59,433
purity or what,

2273
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:04,220
but it rubbed me wrong that
we aren't equal anymore.

2274
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:07,340
No, that's understandable. But that's
also got to give you some motivation.

2275
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:09,780
Exactly.
Told him in the area of the wine,

2276
01:55:09,790 --> 01:55:13,100
I'll sit on the plane and I was really
directly behind Jon Jones and I see a

2277
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:14,630
head Bob and I was just looking,

2278
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:17,510
I looked at my wife and she's like
struggling like falling asleep but a shrug

2279
01:55:17,511 --> 01:55:19,690
and fall asleep. I looked at the top
of his head, the back of his head.

2280
01:55:19,690 --> 01:55:22,040
I was just like,
it's time for a change of the torch.

2281
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:23,720
I think my brother always said like,

2282
01:55:23,721 --> 01:55:25,560
you're good and you know
you can beat everybody.

2283
01:55:25,561 --> 01:55:28,220
But I feel like when I come to those
top guys like John Johnson guts,

2284
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:31,990
you doubt yourself just a little bit.
You ain't sure that you can get to me.

2285
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:33,110
You know you're good.

2286
01:55:33,111 --> 01:55:36,060
But you feel like this was before
like before they leave fight,

2287
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:39,350
you get there and you, you feel like
you don't think you're ready for that.

2288
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:42,200
But I'm checking her. Watch you bro. I
know that you made it. You can do it.

2289
01:55:42,590 --> 01:55:44,040
And when I down I saw him Baba

2290
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,640
and all the frustration going through
my mind. Six o'clock in the morning.

2291
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:49,720
We had to get up and catch a plane
cause this guys, isn't this, it's,

2292
01:55:49,721 --> 01:55:53,550
they show up on time. He still was
late to that and it was just like I,

2293
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:55,840
if I'm the champ, I don't want this. Yeah.

2294
01:55:55,870 --> 01:55:57,150
I mean I don't want no special treatment.

2295
01:55:57,390 --> 01:56:01,020
If you tell me what sign up ahead
of time and keep your schedule,

2296
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:05,340
I expect that if we get down
to scale first, come first,
first come, first serve.

2297
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:07,620
If I show up late,
put me in the order I am,

2298
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:11,640
don't put me up front because I'm the
champ because I was the first and second

2299
01:56:11,641 --> 01:56:14,820
person there. I'm always just scale
and John was walking down the stairs,

2300
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:15,451
fully dressed.

2301
01:56:15,451 --> 01:56:18,510
We went back to commission room and I
remember people in the blue shirt came and

2302
01:56:18,511 --> 01:56:20,760
said, hold up, hold up. And
all of sudden John come in,

2303
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:23,010
he could do all the paperwork.
He went on a scale and he was out.

2304
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:27,180
He was last present. Donna, how's it? He's
first like it wasn't that big of a deal,

2305
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:30,510
but the fact that I don't like that. Well
it's because he's headline in the card,

2306
01:56:30,511 --> 01:56:33,030
right? Yeah. Giving them
special treat, everything.

2307
01:56:33,031 --> 01:56:34,590
That's what he kept saying
is John Jones there.

2308
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:38,880
How I got the phone with this John Jones.
They hang up like, I don't like that.

2309
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:41,010
It's still, he's still a person. Well,

2310
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:44,430
he's the greatest person
to be Corey Anderson.

2311
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:48,960
Hundred percent change the tide. There's
Corey Anderson, but treat me. Know Him.

2312
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:52,270
Don't get me treatment. Beautiful.
That you have that attitude. What?

2313
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:54,510
When you look at John and
you look at John's skills,

2314
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:59,570
like what do you think you need to do
if anything different in your life or in

2315
01:56:59,881 --> 01:57:02,940
your training or where do you need to get
to where you think you could beat him?

2316
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,540
Just keep getting better.
Like does Leo,

2317
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:09,690
the Tfa fight must've been a
big boost for 100% every fight.

2318
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:11,580
Every fight.
Even the ones I lost,

2319
01:57:11,581 --> 01:57:13,220
it all been the boost
because you go back and see,

2320
01:57:13,290 --> 01:57:15,320
tell me a fight that I've been
getting beat up, Joe. Right?

2321
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:18,510
I've never been a fight where somebody,
they're all core, you're too smart,

2322
01:57:18,511 --> 01:57:19,020
you're not good.

2323
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:21,930
There's never been one fight in my career
where somebody straight manhandled me

2324
01:57:21,931 --> 01:57:26,010
and push me around. You know what I mean?
They talk about this, this and this. Uh,

2325
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:27,211
he's the greatest sense.

2326
01:57:27,211 --> 01:57:30,360
He's greatest that I was watching the
UFC main event last night in hotel.

2327
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:32,970
They had the Glover or shy fight and
that's how I'm going is this and this and

2328
01:57:32,971 --> 01:57:35,700
this and up and gloves. This
clover that Clovis, Clovis at,

2329
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:38,410
I think I beat that guy.
You know,

2330
01:57:38,411 --> 01:57:40,560
and just like you're talking about hope
they don't give it a little t or Johnny

2331
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,180
Walker a little TV. He's
super good. This isn't this,

2332
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,880
but at the same time I was thinking,
and you said it, but what about Korea?

2333
01:57:44,881 --> 01:57:48,200
And I was like, there we go. Finally
somebody like, all these guys are talking,

2334
01:57:48,201 --> 01:57:50,820
they talk about how good these guys
not in beat them all. You're like,

2335
01:57:50,821 --> 01:57:52,110
I'm not gonna come onto the radar.

2336
01:57:52,111 --> 01:57:54,520
And they don't expect me to do
nothing because I lost the Gi bill.

2337
01:57:54,521 --> 01:57:57,930
I would say my third or fourth
fight in UFC two years of my career.

2338
01:57:58,150 --> 01:58:00,920
You know what I mean? Uh,
Jimmy man with Jimmy met,

2339
01:58:00,921 --> 01:58:03,390
I was told we on the way here
to Jimmy man was the only fight.

2340
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:07,590
I would say the guy beat me.
He didn't man handle me,

2341
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:11,310
but in my head from his highlights and
it's all like you said on Instagram,

2342
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:15,800
reading comments and I let what people
were saying and reading and seeing him

2343
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:19,800
get in my head to think if this got
touches me, he's going to put me out.

2344
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:24,180
And when you're going into
a fight thinking that I
literally got touched and my

2345
01:58:24,181 --> 01:58:26,520
mind was already set. Like
if I get hit, I'm going out.

2346
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:29,400
And like I think subconsciously,

2347
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:32,720
like I had myself so
doubted that when he hit me,

2348
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:37,170
my mind just like in panic kind of shut
down because I remember when I hit the

2349
01:58:37,171 --> 01:58:40,470
mat, like I wasn't Algebra,
I don't remember I was out.

2350
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,100
But I remember seeing his feet walk away.

2351
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:45,430
And I remember when I came through
clearly and I thought to myself like it

2352
01:58:45,431 --> 01:58:48,250
happened. Is that what I'll
put them on my, if I got hit,

2353
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:51,880
it happened and after that, that
was it. It was like I can take,

2354
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:53,080
I can take it to anybody.

2355
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:57,340
And I think Osp was more dangerous
than Jimmy because he can kick,

2356
01:58:57,341 --> 01:59:00,520
he was explosive and this isn't the amp
punch now did everything right and just

2357
01:59:00,521 --> 01:59:03,820
slipped into the punch the wrong way. But
I was, man, Halan don't put three rounds.

2358
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:07,090
And I mean it's simple mistakes because
I didn't have the discipline yet.

2359
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:11,050
In three years of my career I hadn't
learned the discipline and focus that it's

2360
01:59:11,051 --> 01:59:14,200
a 15 minute fight.
I can win 12 minutes of it all.

2361
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:15,700
But one mistake and it's all gone.

2362
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:20,200
Well, the experience of making those
mistakes and realizing what they are and,

2363
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:24,680
and then when those moments come up again
and you deviate from the game plan and

2364
01:59:24,681 --> 01:59:28,220
you do go to your right and you do move
the wrong direction, you know, you'll,

2365
01:59:28,221 --> 01:59:31,190
you'll catch yourself.
You'll realize it's

2366
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:37,100
the experience of competition
for a fighter is there's
nothing that substitutes

2367
01:59:37,101 --> 01:59:40,100
it. He could have great talent.
You can have a great mindset.

2368
01:59:40,101 --> 01:59:43,130
But the experience of
competition is like nothing else.

2369
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:47,690
And one thing that I've seen from you
is that every time you have had losses,

2370
01:59:47,691 --> 01:59:49,640
you've gone back to work
and come back better.

2371
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:52,100
Like you made significant
jumps in between each fight.

2372
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:54,350
That's why you like when we're
talking about fighters and I said,

2373
01:59:54,351 --> 01:59:55,580
well what about Corey Anderson?

2374
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:59,360
Because people do leave you out of the
discussion but they don't leave you out

2375
01:59:59,361 --> 02:00:02,330
of discussion because you're not good.
They for whatever reason,

2376
02:00:02,331 --> 02:00:04,580
leave you out of discussion because
maybe because you're a polite,

2377
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:08,820
soft spoken guy and you, you haven't
been knocking people out like that's the,

2378
02:00:08,821 --> 02:00:12,410
the the knock on you.
If there is a nine but you're winning,

2379
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:16,010
winning is with fighting.
The key is winning.

2380
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:20,450
It's not knocking people out or some many
people. The key is winning. I can you,

2381
02:00:20,451 --> 02:00:22,550
when can you beat worldclass guys?

2382
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:26,490
You shown you could beat worldclass guys
and the fact that you've done this with

2383
02:00:26,491 --> 02:00:29,960
just seven years total training
is pretty fucking incredible.

2384
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:33,390
Pretty amazing man.
You read your voice down the air.

2385
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:37,840
I can say it all day and nobody is.
You shouldn't even say it at all.

2386
02:00:37,850 --> 02:00:40,250
Let me say it for you,
is I got to get off of me.

2387
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:44,780
Didn't realize I'll fuck off social
media post and run. Just Post and run.

2388
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:47,150
Because it's like we were saying before,

2389
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:51,890
it's just not a healthy way to consume
things. So they're just the random cause.

2390
02:00:51,891 --> 02:00:56,660
P two is too many people out there that
are bored or maybe they're not healthy

2391
02:00:56,661 --> 02:00:59,780
mentally and they're just,
they would like to fuck with your head.

2392
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:01,160
And they see a guy like you,

2393
02:01:01,161 --> 02:01:05,060
especially at guy who is on that
elite athlete fighting in the UFC.

2394
02:01:05,061 --> 02:01:09,320
There's so much jealousy and pettiness
and spit in sports fans are weird like

2395
02:01:09,321 --> 02:01:13,190
that. They'll call some guy who was making
$20 million a year of fucking loser,

2396
02:01:13,690 --> 02:01:17,390
but it's crazy. But you sit at
home on food stamps watching crazy,

2397
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:20,750
but their words,
although they mean nothing,

2398
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:25,690
if you see them in print and it's about
you, it can get you to go, hey, hmm.

2399
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:29,180
And that might fuck with you while
you're running. Fuck that guy. You know?

2400
02:01:29,181 --> 02:01:33,530
And there might be 30 of those guys.
And if you, you go downhill spiral.

2401
02:01:33,740 --> 02:01:37,760
If you have a weak mind and you don't
understand how to compartmentalize and how

2402
02:01:37,761 --> 02:01:40,220
to,
how to look things objectively,

2403
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:44,690
if you don't see what that is and you
start I five I was saw him, I'd say this,

2404
02:01:44,691 --> 02:01:48,430
so come see that shit to my face. And you
started getting involved in that stuff.

2405
02:01:48,450 --> 02:01:52,580
This just a giant waste of resources,
a giant waste of energy.

2406
02:01:52,581 --> 02:01:53,990
It doesn't do you any good at all.

2407
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:58,040
Especially when look at what
you're surrounded with, man.

2408
02:01:58,041 --> 02:02:01,130
You telling me it's all
family elite fighters,

2409
02:02:01,131 --> 02:02:02,540
some of the best guys in the world.

2410
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:06,370
You have one of the best coaches on the
planet earth. Many of Ricardo Almeida,

2411
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,240
one of the best Jujitsu
coaches on the planet earth.

2412
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:12,350
You're with some elite world class
fighters. You're all tied together.

2413
02:02:12,590 --> 02:02:16,340
That should be all of your mental diet,

2414
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:20,660
all of your communication, camaraderie,
all your interaction with people.

2415
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:24,260
It should be that cause you got
top of the food chain. Like,

2416
02:02:24,261 --> 02:02:29,120
why fuck with all these scavengers online
and cannibals and fucking zombies and

2417
02:02:29,121 --> 02:02:31,970
that's what you're dealing with when
you get into those comments sections,

2418
02:02:31,971 --> 02:02:35,540
you don't know who these people are. You
know what I mean? It could be anybody.

2419
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:39,080
True story just for a fighter.
You the mentality,

2420
02:02:39,081 --> 02:02:40,670
and this is another thing that
I wanted to ask you about.

2421
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:45,170
Your mentality is so fucking important.
Do you use a mental coach and you,

2422
02:02:45,171 --> 02:02:48,380
have you ever been hypnotized? If you
ever worked with a mental coach at all?

2423
02:02:48,690 --> 02:02:53,040
Only thing I did different this year
was the BrainTap a brain call him a

2424
02:02:53,430 --> 02:02:55,860
physical therapist thing and you
put the sound on this kind of,

2425
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:58,920
it's like Kinda like hypnosis and they
got like flashing lights that you can go

2426
02:02:58,921 --> 02:03:00,750
take a nap, whatever.
And it's kind of like,

2427
02:03:00,751 --> 02:03:02,730
well this isn't like they say you listen
to Rosetta stone or something before

2428
02:03:02,731 --> 02:03:03,780
you go to bed.
When you wake up,

2429
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,880
it's in your mind as you
heard it at the same thing.

2430
02:03:05,881 --> 02:03:07,980
So I take a nap and I put it in.
It's always positive thoughts.

2431
02:03:07,981 --> 02:03:10,650
It's like take a deep breath.
Just, and this and it slowly,

2432
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:14,550
it's just you hear it talking,
he's speaking and he's slowly stops,

2433
02:03:14,551 --> 02:03:17,130
but you see the light's still going
off but is there and you push it and

2434
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:17,400
forwards.

2435
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:20,500
You can hear him like very lightly talking
in the background and I take like an

2436
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:23,460
APP like 30 minutes. So what are
the like the Buddha is the lights.

2437
02:03:23,461 --> 02:03:26,400
How does it work? I think it's like,
just got to hear Jamie's got it.

2438
02:03:26,430 --> 02:03:27,241
Because you want to pull one over.
Yeah,

2439
02:03:27,241 --> 02:03:30,540
I think it's like pulling a BrainTap
headset. Yeah, there you go.

2440
02:03:30,541 --> 02:03:33,360
And I think the lights and stuff is
just keep your focus to your body isn't

2441
02:03:33,361 --> 02:03:35,160
completely sleep or song.
Let me see this.

2442
02:03:35,161 --> 02:03:40,161
It says uses unique frequencies of light
and sound for brainwave entrainment in

2443
02:03:40,521 --> 02:03:44,520
just 22 minutes of deep relaxation.
Your brain will be guided to relax,

2444
02:03:44,730 --> 02:03:49,650
proven scientific techniques allow your
brain to rest and allows your brain the

2445
02:03:49,651 --> 02:03:53,820
rest and recovery that it needs by
reaching various states of consciousness,

2446
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:54,713
reboot,

2447
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:59,720
clean the slate of unimportant and of
the unimportant and reinforced the most

2448
02:04:00,061 --> 02:04:04,650
valuable information for better
memory and brainpower. And revitalize.

2449
02:04:04,651 --> 02:04:07,290
Our sessions are designed
to build resilient,

2450
02:04:07,650 --> 02:04:11,780
build a resilient mind and fit
body from life. Huh. Anyway,

2451
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:12,990
that and float tank.

2452
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:18,330
That was another thing I I relax cause
the only thing I had a problem with,

2453
02:04:18,810 --> 02:04:22,020
I used to, you're always going to have
dreams. You know, if I have a bad spine,

2454
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:24,300
whatever, I'm thinking negative. So when
I go to bed or have a negative dream,

2455
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:27,180
have a dream, I got to take
down 10 times. I had a dream,

2456
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:28,610
I got hit hard in practice.
I had a dream,

2457
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:31,740
I got hit hard and I put it out nice
to feel like and going into fights.

2458
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:36,090
If I had one of them dreams,
like I remember just before
the Gian volante files.

2459
02:04:36,091 --> 02:04:38,910
After I Fall Justin,
I went home at first and I went to sleep.

2460
02:04:38,911 --> 02:04:42,270
I woke up and had the dream.
I fought Gian Volante next not floss,

2461
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:43,710
a split decision.

2462
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:47,670
And in my mind I remember going into that
fight in that stave vivid in my head,

2463
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,270
I'll lose, he's got split
decision somehow. My dream. No,

2464
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:51,570
I was fighting Jabil onto the next,

2465
02:04:51,890 --> 02:04:54,720
it had lost split decision and I
think that's why in the third round,

2466
02:04:54,930 --> 02:04:56,280
even though everybody was
saying like you were saying,

2467
02:04:56,281 --> 02:04:59,120
the leg kicks and everything and when
it came up they showed a scorecard.

2468
02:04:59,121 --> 02:05:01,080
There's like,
I guess I was winning on the scorecards,

2469
02:05:01,081 --> 02:05:04,500
but in my mind I thought I was getting
defeated and I had to go harder and go

2470
02:05:04,501 --> 02:05:08,340
hard and I was getting beat up because
in my dream is so vivid in my mind.

2471
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:12,630
So I got greedy and coaches just
kept saying like just oof. Oof.

2472
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,850
I was just doing the most trying
to hit him as much as I could.

2473
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:16,830
And you kept saying it
and I watched the video.

2474
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:18,930
You said the best offense
is the best defense.

2475
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:22,830
If Cory can get hit Gian can't throw
anything back. So that was my mind.

2476
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:24,870
If I get it this round ten
eight there's no way I lose.

2477
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:26,940
So I ain't hit him as much as
I can as many times as I can.

2478
02:05:26,941 --> 02:05:29,580
Maybe I'll put them out and I
got overzealous and got caught.

2479
02:05:29,850 --> 02:05:31,980
And then when the scorecards came on
and said I was winning and there was no

2480
02:05:31,981 --> 02:05:35,430
reason for me to do all that in
my mind going into that fight,

2481
02:05:35,431 --> 02:05:37,230
I remember all fight with
bad dream kept popping up,

2482
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:38,580
never had another dream losing again.

2483
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:43,310
But that was from December of the year
before and he was stuck in my head for

2484
02:05:43,311 --> 02:05:46,780
some, I couldn't let go of it
and then I can't or whatever.

2485
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:51,510
If I had another one that it didn't
show the, uh, the finish of the fight,

2486
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:54,830
but I woke up with direct eight and two
at the time I was a one or [inaudible]

2487
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:56,190
71 [inaudible] 81.

2488
02:05:56,580 --> 02:06:01,580
And this was before going into the Tom
Lawler fight and I was nothing like,

2489
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:02,880
fuck,
do I lose this?

2490
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,880
And I remember in Vegas he rocked me
in the beginning and I thought for sure

2491
02:06:05,881 --> 02:06:08,070
that has given them scroll, kind of like,
here you go, here come that dream again.

2492
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:11,450
Her Andrea again. When I say core answer,
now I've ever gone to a hotel room.

2493
02:06:11,470 --> 02:06:14,490
Somebody put a sign on, it said
nine and one now. Congratulations.

2494
02:06:14,491 --> 02:06:16,920
And that's been stuck in my head
like, oh gosh, that's what he means.

2495
02:06:16,921 --> 02:06:19,230
Nothing and that's my
dreams are just dreams.

2496
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:22,440
I got to get the float
tank helps you float tank,

2497
02:06:22,441 --> 02:06:24,600
hit my getting there and relax
like the negative thoughts.

2498
02:06:24,601 --> 02:06:29,220
I always do it the week, the last week,
Sunday I do massage. I go to church,

2499
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:32,220
massage,
float tank and there's nothing on my mind,

2500
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:34,650
but the Bible and the Gospel,

2501
02:06:34,651 --> 02:06:37,350
I heard that morning I go to
the massage and I fall asleep.

2502
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:38,730
Am I going to that float tank?

2503
02:06:38,730 --> 02:06:42,630
I think about what I need to do and the
don't mind songs stop and I'm thinking

2504
02:06:42,631 --> 02:06:46,320
about is that fight with victory, winning,
getting my hand raise, whichever way,

2505
02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:50,010
dominate, dominate, dominate.
When I wake up that whole week,

2506
02:06:50,011 --> 02:06:53,310
I don't have any negative thoughts
because that's what I visually that lasts

2507
02:06:53,311 --> 02:06:58,290
three times or work at home and was all
positive thinking and with the brain tap

2508
02:06:58,291 --> 02:07:01,770
like my doc, let me take it to the fight
with me so I'm resting between training,

2509
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:06,340
put it on. He gave me his little travel
iPhone where they put it on the brain,

2510
02:07:06,350 --> 02:07:10,620
the brain tap and just wake up. Like I say
relax like Avi, I get down on practice,

2511
02:07:10,621 --> 02:07:13,860
I'm tired, I'm exhausted. But that
little 15 20 million that which I want,

2512
02:07:13,861 --> 02:07:16,890
I use one of my brain
come back to is like,

2513
02:07:16,891 --> 02:07:21,410
I feel like I just slept for hours
so much for you.

2514
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:24,480
I been the type, I never believe
any of that stuff like hypnosis,

2515
02:07:24,550 --> 02:07:26,160
I never believed it.
But after he let me try it,

2516
02:07:26,161 --> 02:07:30,990
like just try once and I tried it and I
actually like it was that my body relax.

2517
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:36,250
I noticed the next day and train like Dang
like this a juicy like I always sugar.

2518
02:07:36,251 --> 02:07:38,600
Did you choose to I hate,
it's just my phone. I went to,

2519
02:07:38,610 --> 02:07:39,850
I finally realize things I was doing.

2520
02:07:39,851 --> 02:07:43,650
I was at lax parents who
Ricardo was saying washing
the small details and he was

2521
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:45,580
like, Bro, you look good
today. And I was thinking like,

2522
02:07:45,581 --> 02:07:48,490
I think maybe that BrainTap actually
kind of how I kept doing it.

2523
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:52,420
Put your mind in a good place to learn
things. So you kind of open mind,

2524
02:07:52,450 --> 02:07:56,290
you relaxed, you wake up and it's like
the air frill smells a lot fresher.

2525
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:58,990
You hear a bird, it's like, it's
just like I said like hypnosis,

2526
02:07:58,991 --> 02:08:01,510
they say it works and I guess that's not,

2527
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:05,680
it's not putting me to sleep a putting
out hip knows hematites but the way it

2528
02:08:05,681 --> 02:08:09,750
made me feel like I ain't want to say,
oh I work hypnosis was like I hypnotized.

2529
02:08:09,810 --> 02:08:12,700
But subliminal messages,
you don't hear it.

2530
02:08:12,701 --> 02:08:14,830
Like if you listen to music and some
in the background, it's in there.

2531
02:08:15,010 --> 02:08:17,500
How often are you doing that brain tap?
Well now I haven't done,

2532
02:08:17,501 --> 02:08:20,410
I'm about to buy one of those from my uh,
physical therapist.

2533
02:08:20,411 --> 02:08:22,690
He got some extra ones he said he'd
get rid of so I can do it more.

2534
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:25,870
But I usually do it when I get in the
camp and I'm old physical therapist place.

2535
02:08:25,871 --> 02:08:29,920
They relocated and closed down here so
that's why I haven't done it that much.

2536
02:08:29,921 --> 02:08:33,490
But he said, I've got some us, I still
have one at home and you use it everyday.

2537
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:36,160
Not Everyday. I don't want to
get too sucked into it. But yeah,

2538
02:08:36,161 --> 02:08:39,640
at least twice a week. Twice a week. I
do it when I go to therapy twice a week.

2539
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:44,320
I got through at once,
once just that last day before I leave.

2540
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:48,240
Just kind of like Whoa, I want to over
water. Look you drink too much water.

2541
02:08:48,290 --> 02:08:50,200
It backfire.
So I don't want to do the same thing.

2542
02:08:50,201 --> 02:08:53,200
A float tank cause float tank is also
great for the injuries in the body.

2543
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,760
You know,
that's how I found it at first.

2544
02:08:54,761 --> 02:08:57,730
My shoulders real messed up once a pet
comes to fight and I kept getting Stinger

2545
02:08:57,990 --> 02:09:00,700
and I couldn't figure it out. My
physical therapist, she was like,

2546
02:09:00,701 --> 02:09:03,250
you need to go try float tank.
I think it'd be really good.

2547
02:09:03,251 --> 02:09:06,220
Help you with your other bumps and bruises
and pull off a couple ounces at the

2548
02:09:06,221 --> 02:09:08,190
same time cause I'll Epson salt.
Just sit there and try it.

2549
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:12,790
I reached out to the guy and brick in a,
he gave me a little, do I hook you up?

2550
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:14,990
You know you advertise for me
and I'll let you float. Yeah.

2551
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:17,260
So I did it and I liked it.
Like I said,

2552
02:09:17,261 --> 02:09:20,050
the Nigga thoughts going into the fact
comes fight. That's where I got the dream.

2553
02:09:20,051 --> 02:09:23,410
I got takedown, took down like 10 times
because I had a guy come on, he's like,

2554
02:09:23,411 --> 02:09:24,900
I've trained with pay is
really good in wrestling.

2555
02:09:24,910 --> 02:09:26,830
This guy was national
champ and he's really good.

2556
02:09:26,831 --> 02:09:28,540
He might take her down a couple of times,
but he came out,

2557
02:09:28,541 --> 02:09:31,810
Carter Carter Cardio and my mom's like,
I don't wanna get taken down at all.

2558
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:33,040
So I started having dreams.

2559
02:09:33,041 --> 02:09:37,330
I was getting taken down like 10 12
times over about pet and that couldn't

2560
02:09:37,331 --> 02:09:41,270
happen. And as you see, I end up taking
him down. I didn't want to shoot that.

2561
02:09:41,330 --> 02:09:42,610
I just wanted to kill him on the feet.

2562
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:45,260
I ended up taking it down 12
times and I was struck the shit.

2563
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:47,350
Think you were taking them
down because of your dream.

2564
02:09:47,470 --> 02:09:49,060
Like you wanted to prove your dream wrong,

2565
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:52,960
like maybe you had that took him down
when it was so easy. I was just like,

2566
02:09:52,961 --> 02:09:55,350
I'm just gonna keep doing this.
Hit Him with a couple of punches.

2567
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:56,111
When Gary Did Punch,

2568
02:09:56,111 --> 02:09:59,530
take them down cause I'm thinking in my
mind it's got stressed at the Olympic

2569
02:09:59,531 --> 02:10:02,620
level. Do you want all American Penn
state, the best school out there?

2570
02:10:02,621 --> 02:10:05,110
I'm thinking there's no way he's going
to be easy to take this guy down.

2571
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:07,270
It had to wait till he get
tired and chain wrestle.

2572
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I just like one of my
weakest blessed though,

2573
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:12,730
whatever and just blew him off
his feet and I was like, that was,

2574
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,720
that was kind of easy.

2575
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:16,330
But it's different when you got a guy
that's used to taking people down,

2576
02:10:16,331 --> 02:10:17,470
but nobody shoots on him.

2577
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:22,780
He wasn't used to that young person
that shot him was a Yom blocker, which,

2578
02:10:22,781 --> 02:10:24,580
and that's when he was tired.
He finally got to take down.

2579
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,100
Everybody else couldn't get it. So
it was like, I'm just gonna try it.

2580
02:10:28,101 --> 02:10:31,270
And I went through him. It was
like, Oh man, that was too easy.

2581
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:34,010
I told mark in the corner like
when had my leg in the corner,

2582
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:35,450
you got to defend it.
You got to defend it.

2583
02:10:35,690 --> 02:10:39,190
I can feel it feel and we hit the cage
and my wizard was so tightly he had the

2584
02:10:39,191 --> 02:10:41,700
leg. I looked at her was like,
and he asked me to come on.

2585
02:10:41,701 --> 02:10:43,670
What was your shaking your head like?
He wasn't taking me down.

2586
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:46,130
He's not going to take me down.
I can tell from the way he answered.

2587
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:48,800
I trained with Nica tone
and he was another UFC vet.

2588
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:51,560
He's a fucking monster when it comes
to wrestling. Him and Chris Weidman,

2589
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:56,360
two tubs dudes I've ever arrested and
they haven't made game and I knew when he

2590
02:10:56,361 --> 02:10:58,280
answered him he was nothing
compared to those guys.

2591
02:10:58,281 --> 02:11:01,450
I just looked at nick or Ricardo shook
my head and nick knew cause he was in the

2592
02:11:01,451 --> 02:11:04,310
corner too. He knew he could tell
him my conference. I wasn't worried.

2593
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:06,860
He's not giving me down.
And after that it was over.

2594
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:12,020
So this brain tap thing,
a float tank one week before the fight,

2595
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:13,940
the last week.
What other,

2596
02:11:13,970 --> 02:11:17,360
do you have any other rituals that you
do that you make sure you keep your head

2597
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:19,490
and your body in check?
I mean, like I said,

2598
02:11:19,491 --> 02:11:22,160
I'm always on physical therapy cause
like I said, my body so beat up,

2599
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:25,910
I haven't competed span ice baths
every Sunday night after I do all that,

2600
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:29,350
I go home and relax. And that night
before I go to bed, 20 minutes in,

2601
02:11:29,630 --> 02:11:33,380
fill the tub up. What? I sit there,
I do cryo therapy twice a week,

2602
02:11:33,381 --> 02:11:36,200
once or twice a week,
all training camp, um,

2603
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:39,440
therapy twice a week I do a
massage every Sunday. You know,

2604
02:11:39,441 --> 02:11:42,160
I got a lady that used to train
at our gym. Amazing. Right.

2605
02:11:42,161 --> 02:11:44,930
And everybody's like with Yoga. Yeah,
I do that too. Every once in a while,

2606
02:11:44,931 --> 02:11:46,760
like closer to get that flexibility.

2607
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:49,580
Hot Yoga helped me get some pounds off
a little easier so I can wreak Heidrick

2608
02:11:49,581 --> 02:11:53,180
more before a spar. I did that
Friday night with Saturday response.

2609
02:11:53,181 --> 02:11:56,390
I'm more limber to throw kicks and stuff
on my final spar throughout the week.

2610
02:11:56,930 --> 02:11:58,370
So, you know, I got different,

2611
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:01,730
different places and companies I reached
out to and they helped me, I helped him.

2612
02:12:01,940 --> 02:12:05,750
That's awesome. So where are you at
right now? They are first of all,

2613
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:08,030
what is going on with the knuckle?
Holy Shit.

2614
02:12:08,050 --> 02:12:11,660
That would just glow over his
forehead. I hit him with, here you go.

2615
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:17,330
Put your hand up. This one right in front
of you. Look at that. Knock off folks

2616
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:22,490
or the upper cut on a glow
over in the third round.

2617
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:27,190
Now I remember when mark was calling a
combo, he said, I can't remember. He said,

2618
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:29,310
and I hit him with him with
the right hand, like, oh,

2619
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:31,960
and my brother and I looked down at my
hand up and this finger like stuck out

2620
02:12:31,961 --> 02:12:34,740
like that. I remember shaking my
head demark like, nope, we were us.

2621
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:39,070
After he shot shaking hands, slapped
my hand, his hand, his hands mess.

2622
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:42,200
I think I dislocated my finger. He
went in the back. Oh, just this. Okay.

2623
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:45,620
We probably back and I couldn't get it
and we kept trying to just keep them

2624
02:12:45,621 --> 02:12:47,960
taped together and keep it straight
and get better and everything.

2625
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:51,080
I remember holding my wife was
like, don't move it. Don't move it.

2626
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:53,390
You got to quit me. I was doing it.
It's like don't exercise mentally.

2627
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:56,000
Like it might hurt now if I get
used to it. It never heard again.

2628
02:12:56,090 --> 02:12:57,800
Did you ever go to a
doctor? Yeah, I went in,

2629
02:12:57,801 --> 02:13:01,120
I ruptured a tendon and the tendon from
here road all the way up and that study

2630
02:13:01,121 --> 02:13:04,310
is, it rolled up and it was already fat
cause I broke this finger and Col. Dot.

2631
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:07,310
So all of this, that's why I was
like curve like when I go down.

2632
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:09,900
So was there anything they
could do for it? Making it,

2633
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:12,800
they said we can straighten out and put
a pin to attach it, but it will take,

2634
02:13:12,830 --> 02:13:17,330
I be able to bend my hand like this,
but a decided it'd be kind of like,

2635
02:13:17,331 --> 02:13:19,970
it wouldn't bend all the way anymore
if I did that. That's what he said.

2636
02:13:19,971 --> 02:13:21,700
Like if you do that, you're going
to be at the fight. You know,

2637
02:13:21,701 --> 02:13:24,890
it's Kinda hard cause I guess
the pen is kind of long.

2638
02:13:24,891 --> 02:13:29,180
So that makes that joint not bend all the
way. But uh, when I went to the doctor,

2639
02:13:29,181 --> 02:13:32,370
they did that. They was like, hold on.
They did an ray and an MRI was like,

2640
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:36,330
that makes no sense. Like this
tendon is how you move this finger.

2641
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:40,130
So how the hell you move your finger and
you know, 10. And I was like, I don't,

2642
02:13:40,150 --> 02:13:40,891
when it was taped together,

2643
02:13:40,891 --> 02:13:43,200
just kept doing it in Germany
while I was on my vacation.

2644
02:13:43,201 --> 02:13:45,160
My wife just kept doing
it extra side and say,

2645
02:13:45,161 --> 02:13:46,440
well I guess it's a
good thing you did that.

2646
02:13:46,441 --> 02:13:49,530
Cause if he wouldn't have it would've
hired harden up in here and this joint

2647
02:13:49,550 --> 02:13:51,840
would have been immobilized.
I won't be able to use it.

2648
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:55,020
But the fact that I kept doing it
while it was fresh, I'm still able

2649
02:13:55,740 --> 02:13:59,260
to move it. That's the craziest Logan
Finger I've ever seen in my life.

2650
02:13:59,261 --> 02:14:02,840
That's like a triple finger.
That's nuts, man. That is,

2651
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:06,940
that's a wild looking joint. Does that
fuck with you grappling or anything?

2652
02:14:07,110 --> 02:14:10,480
Nothing was hard as a rock man.
It doesn't bother me at all. Wow.

2653
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:15,010
It's crazy looking, man. I think it's
a weapon. Now, the glove right here,

2654
02:14:15,011 --> 02:14:18,820
if I throw a hook my right hand, right?
Yeah, I suck. Right. It's all calcified,

2655
02:14:18,821 --> 02:14:21,350
right? Yeah. Yeah. So, um,

2656
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:25,210
where are you at right now in terms of
like when does the UFC usually come to

2657
02:14:25,211 --> 02:14:27,450
you with a, an idea of what, who
are you going to fight next time?

2658
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:30,790
Obviously you beat Latifa.
He was top five. Yeah.

2659
02:14:30,791 --> 02:14:33,010
So you're three and five.
What did they,

2660
02:14:33,220 --> 02:14:36,740
what did he got you ranked now eighth or
ninth. How's that work? Did you tell him?

2661
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:40,840
Ask him how's, how does Koreans
and night and the top five,

2662
02:14:40,841 --> 02:14:44,260
I'm beat the number three and the five.
When I was three, they put me at six.

2663
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:45,273
I don't know,

2664
02:14:45,470 --> 02:14:49,570
they put me at six like I
beat Glover and I went to six.

2665
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:52,690
By the time I fought I
was 10 that night in Cali.

2666
02:14:52,691 --> 02:14:54,460
I was ranked 10th in and how
the Hell does that happen?

2667
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:59,410
Then I'd be the leader who was six
and I went, or fifth or fourth one.

2668
02:14:59,630 --> 02:15:02,470
I went to six and then a
week later I was at seven.

2669
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:06,920
The next week it came out of
that, hey, this makes no sense.

2670
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:12,550
There's no fights happen. Don't even
care what you're clearly top 10.

2671
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:16,290
You know, and whatever number that is. I
mean, it's a, you got a murderer's row.

2672
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:20,380
People in that division,
you know, they, when,

2673
02:15:20,381 --> 02:15:23,780
when do you think they'll come to
you with a, an offer for, I mean if

2674
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:26,940
I Gus at a time, like I said,
after filing the microphone,

2675
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:29,880
I don't want to fight anything
else until my babies here.

2676
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:31,430
When the baby's here and
everything's checked out,

2677
02:15:31,431 --> 02:15:34,550
I don't have to be in camp and stress
this and this. Once that's all done,

2678
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:35,413
we can talk.

2679
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:39,660
And they called him a couple weeks later
about Gus because he tweeted me and had

2680
02:15:39,661 --> 02:15:42,650
them ask me area and I said the same
thing. Like I'm waiting til my baby's Jen.

2681
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:47,280
That was March 15th the due date and
my baby was March 12th it's too close,

2682
02:15:47,281 --> 02:15:49,530
not risking it, you know?
Then there's like, all right,

2683
02:15:49,531 --> 02:15:52,650
what about June 1st and I was just ain't
letting me kind of finish with my baby

2684
02:15:52,651 --> 02:15:54,570
and stuff. I'm not really even
training my home. My wife,

2685
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:56,700
I'm doing a little bit here and there,
but I'm worried about hurting now.

2686
02:15:56,730 --> 02:16:00,240
She's been with me ride down this whole
time. That was my time to focus on her,

2687
02:16:00,330 --> 02:16:01,950
what she needs.
She didn't want me to away,

2688
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:07,050
so I'm here and they kept calling and kept
calling and I just kept saying, no, no,

2689
02:16:07,410 --> 02:16:10,140
no. And they kept asking me. I was like,
oh. And Allie, it was like, I mean,

2690
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:12,330
what are we getting more money if
they give him? My wife was like,

2691
02:16:12,331 --> 02:16:15,000
if we can get more, we'll take it
back it. If they give you more,

2692
02:16:15,001 --> 02:16:18,210
I'll let you go whenever we can start
camp or whatever. I had to give me more,

2693
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:20,780
we'd do it and they say, oh no, we
were not doing nothing. The right,

2694
02:16:20,781 --> 02:16:22,650
we didn't wait.
Let me finish this.

2695
02:16:23,430 --> 02:16:28,410
Literally my baby came out and I felt
that. I asked the doctors everything fine.

2696
02:16:28,411 --> 02:16:30,020
They did the test.
Everything came back

2697
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:32,290
clear like there's no problems. Don't have
to go to doctors, nothing. She's like,

2698
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:34,960
you're fine. You've got a healthy
baby boy. Congratulations.

2699
02:16:35,290 --> 02:16:38,380
Literally pick my phone
up. Tweeted Gus. Gus,

2700
02:16:38,410 --> 02:16:41,770
you still want to go June 1st. You want
to do it? I'm going to huckleberry.

2701
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:45,550
Let's go. London. I'll come. Yes, Cory.
You know I wanted to fight. Let's do it.

2702
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:49,270
Ali Call me. It's on his managers call
me. We want to fight. Let's do it.

2703
02:16:49,271 --> 02:16:53,890
June 1st same, same pay. No raise, no
nothing. Whatever I was getting, let's go.

2704
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:56,200
It takes Dana.
They literally,

2705
02:16:56,201 --> 02:16:59,020
they call me the day before on the way to
the hospital. I get a cough. My leader,

2706
02:16:59,021 --> 02:17:00,780
you want to know if you want
to fight, bro. I'm going, wait,

2707
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:04,210
I call you after we figure it out.
I say yes. Less than 24 hours later.

2708
02:17:04,211 --> 02:17:05,530
They say no.
We gave him to Anthony Smith.

2709
02:17:05,531 --> 02:17:09,630
Now what the fuck y'all call me for
yesterday harassing me all his camp now I

2710
02:17:09,631 --> 02:17:13,540
say yes and you're taking it away like
why y'all? What's going on and that.

2711
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:17,140
That made me mad. Then they call me
for Luke Rockhold like I'm not, no,

2712
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:20,230
not taking a step back like I want to
be here for the title. I'll be Luke.

2713
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:23,650
What are they going to say? Cause I
guess if they told Ali, if I beat Glover,

2714
02:17:23,651 --> 02:17:26,290
since he was going to fight earlier, that
peer media contingent for title fight,

2715
02:17:26,291 --> 02:17:29,510
they gave me a new contract and
everything with all that in it signed it.

2716
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:30,041
Then I let it go.

2717
02:17:30,041 --> 02:17:33,880
He need one more fight and it was a guy
make him an Alere fight in at least they

2718
02:17:33,881 --> 02:17:35,080
know cause he managed both of us.

2719
02:17:35,220 --> 02:17:38,120
Don't you see to Luke Rockhold is a good
fight for you and he's a former dupont,

2720
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:42,340
but it wouldn't do nothing but it would
definitely elevate you in the public

2721
02:17:42,341 --> 02:17:43,950
side.
The Guy,

2722
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:49,100
you don't think it would help if no is
what now you would think Galicia chief

2723
02:17:49,181 --> 02:17:50,710
would have helped me in
rank and dangle over.

2724
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:54,940
I don't buy that because I think they'd
like rankings. Look, even if it's not one,

2725
02:17:55,030 --> 02:17:58,180
one through ten eight in any one of
those guys get fight for the title.

2726
02:17:58,210 --> 02:18:02,210
If they get, look, Tiago Thiago
Santos, right? I mean, uh,

2727
02:18:02,550 --> 02:18:05,840
he lost the David Branch one
a year ago. Right? Came out.

2728
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:09,920
I beat Pat Cummings or
April 13th or 18th whatever.

2729
02:18:10,010 --> 02:18:13,880
Now he's fighting for the title. I mean,
it was a quick ascension from, you know,

2730
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:17,860
devastating knockouts and fighting like
a wild maniac like he does and he's a

2731
02:18:17,861 --> 02:18:21,430
wild fighter to watch. Very, very
entertaining guy. That's all it took.

2732
02:18:21,970 --> 02:18:24,280
But who was in that?
He didn't have to be the big name guy.

2733
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:25,810
That's thing he'd be on black with you.

2734
02:18:25,811 --> 02:18:30,190
I killed on my fourth fight in UFC
beat Jimmy beat Jimmy Mattawan. Um,

2735
02:18:30,310 --> 02:18:33,970
stopped him and the other guy,
we're both 85 hours. She didn't,

2736
02:18:33,971 --> 02:18:36,820
so he had two fights is because he
had knockoffs and that's the thing.

2737
02:18:36,820 --> 02:18:38,980
Like I said, I told him, I know. He
was like, Bro, it's a good fight.

2738
02:18:38,981 --> 02:18:41,110
He's the same thing you said.
It's a good fight. Like Ali,

2739
02:18:41,111 --> 02:18:43,150
let's look at who I fought.
I beat Glover who was third.

2740
02:18:43,330 --> 02:18:44,440
They still didn't put minutes.
How fight?

2741
02:18:44,470 --> 02:18:46,960
I'll be a little TV when they say
it's next to beat the champ, whatever.

2742
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:49,360
When I beat him, they still don't give
me the credibility. It's like, oh,

2743
02:18:49,361 --> 02:18:52,050
he's washed up now. I was,
I pop her a tweeter. I like,

2744
02:18:52,051 --> 02:18:53,400
I apologize to anybody that would be,

2745
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:55,870
because once you lose to me it's
kind of like you're a nobody.

2746
02:18:56,670 --> 02:18:59,680
I'm sorry for that time. All their
posts, the thing of the day saying,

2747
02:18:59,710 --> 02:19:02,470
oh these guys all failed. They get
six months. I fell for the same thing.

2748
02:19:02,471 --> 02:19:05,940
I get two years. I said I'm sorry
Tom Cause you lost to me. I think did

2749
02:19:07,870 --> 02:19:09,040
you get the short end of the stick?

2750
02:19:09,041 --> 02:19:13,540
I'm sorry though the same thing is half
of that asshole coach when you were in

2751
02:19:13,541 --> 02:19:18,310
college is it is in the same way and
that's why motivation back to tweets and

2752
02:19:18,311 --> 02:19:21,130
shit cause in my head things
like that that I've been through,

2753
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:23,320
you know what I should learn
but now it doesn't matter.

2754
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:26,770
But in my mind I've voiced my opinion
set coach and when I proved her wrong I

2755
02:19:26,771 --> 02:19:28,040
ran his assistant coach later

2756
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,900
on in life and he said he's,

2757
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:32,030
he doesn't really like you anymore cause
the guy actually I fall in the ultimate

2758
02:19:32,031 --> 02:19:34,880
fighter was his best friend, Kelly
and us, one of his all Americans.

2759
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:37,610
He used to call him back when I was
in college trying to discipline me.

2760
02:19:37,611 --> 02:19:39,500
If I like do some shit to piss him off,

2761
02:19:39,550 --> 02:19:43,540
he would have Kelly come in and try to
beat me up. Never happened. I'm like,

2762
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:46,280
he couldn't beat me up like that.
He used to get pissed at that.

2763
02:19:46,580 --> 02:19:49,640
So the fact that he thought he had like
a hold on me with this transcript and I

2764
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:53,210
got out and then I ended up fighting
Kelly on the show and he said that to him

2765
02:19:53,211 --> 02:19:55,970
probably once I, he kill you and him and
May, he could kill you and then we may,

2766
02:19:56,420 --> 02:19:59,650
well the opportunity came and I beat
him and somebody told him he like,

2767
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:02,810
he wasn't happy about that. He didn't
like the fact that you beat Kelly.

2768
02:20:02,811 --> 02:20:05,170
Like I'm sorry I don't do things for him.

2769
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:07,190
This,
this thing,

2770
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:09,770
what you don't feel like you get
in the respect that you deserve.

2771
02:20:09,890 --> 02:20:11,160
It does motivate your dog.

2772
02:20:11,170 --> 02:20:13,400
It does give you a little bit
of extra juice in the gym.

2773
02:20:14,070 --> 02:20:18,310
I mean, I'm a motivated guy anyway. Highly
motivated. Morning, wake up, open my eyes.

2774
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:19,590
Is it sounding?
Get to work.

2775
02:20:19,690 --> 02:20:23,710
So your son's born, the Anthony
Smith common. He had a, you know,

2776
02:20:23,711 --> 02:20:26,080
Anthony spent survive against
Jon Jones and you know,

2777
02:20:26,081 --> 02:20:29,350
especially early on he looked good,
you know, showed good technique,

2778
02:20:29,380 --> 02:20:30,040
showed that he's,

2779
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:33,070
he's really a world class fighter and
I think that they just think that that

2780
02:20:33,071 --> 02:20:36,250
would be, he probably said yes when you
said no and they gave it to him, you know,

2781
02:20:36,251 --> 02:20:38,050
while you were waiting and
your son was being born.

2782
02:20:38,410 --> 02:20:41,080
So now you're just
waiting for another call.

2783
02:20:41,590 --> 02:20:44,600
Yeah. But the thing is like, go back to
that real fast. They say yes and he said,

2784
02:20:44,601 --> 02:20:47,990
no. I watched his interview,
excuse me, what area? Hawaii.

2785
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:50,630
And they said the day after
he followed Jon Jones,

2786
02:20:50,631 --> 02:20:53,450
they called him about
Anthony Smith or about Gus.

2787
02:20:53,660 --> 02:20:55,700
So that was about the same
time he was calling me.

2788
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:58,850
So it's kind of like they was just
throwing it out there and Holly said, uh,

2789
02:20:59,390 --> 02:21:00,710
I guess they offered it to Johnnie Walker.

2790
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:04,280
Johnnie Walker's manager made a
post I seen that offered us Gus.

2791
02:21:04,330 --> 02:21:06,500
Like they was just the only out there for
whoever's gonna be the first person to

2792
02:21:06,501 --> 02:21:07,334
say yes,

2793
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:11,300
we have a bunch of people say yes and
then they sit down and they go over it.

2794
02:21:11,301 --> 02:21:14,160
Like what looks best for us?
Like what do we have? You know,

2795
02:21:14,690 --> 02:21:17,900
I'm not a matchmaker obviously.
What goes on the wrong thing?

2796
02:21:17,901 --> 02:21:20,210
Just sort of barely do,
man. I'm telling you,

2797
02:21:20,211 --> 02:21:22,910
I know as little as anybody
should in my position,

2798
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:28,310
it's like an independent contractor.
I have no fucking say, look,

2799
02:21:28,311 --> 02:21:29,690
if they listened to me,
first of all,

2800
02:21:29,691 --> 02:21:33,020
there'll be no more weight cutting and
there'd be a way classes every 10 pounds.

2801
02:21:33,350 --> 02:21:35,960
That's what I would, I would fix
that would fix that right away.

2802
02:21:35,990 --> 02:21:40,520
I would do the same sort of hydration
testing that one fc does let people fight

2803
02:21:40,521 --> 02:21:44,390
it, their natural weight.
So you don't have these
ridiculous 40 pound weight cuts.

2804
02:21:44,391 --> 02:21:47,850
Like did you see Brandon Davis
and his last fight? He's a,

2805
02:21:47,930 --> 02:21:51,350
he fought at one 35 I didn't
see the weight cut. Fantastic,

2806
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:54,440
but would freeze skinny.
He was a 45 or whatever.

2807
02:21:54,470 --> 02:21:58,700
She's giant at one 30 if I'm standing
next to him, like, how the fuck are you?

2808
02:21:58,701 --> 02:22:00,530
A 135 pounds?
He does not.

2809
02:22:00,531 --> 02:22:04,580
It looks like he's won 70 he's like
Montel Jackson to bring about the same

2810
02:22:04,581 --> 02:22:06,700
height as me. It's was like
crazy. Like how a, Hey,

2811
02:22:06,701 --> 02:22:10,260
you make one 35 giant hands
like you're a grownup.

2812
02:22:10,350 --> 02:22:14,330
Intel's got basketball palm and hand
hands bigger enough. For instance,

2813
02:22:14,331 --> 02:22:19,040
the guys he does, they're huge and a
35 pounder man in knitting. Any fights.

2814
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:21,940
Smart too. Smart and
technical. I watched, I'm on

2815
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:24,260
the regional circuit.
He fought in my hometown a few times.

2816
02:22:24,261 --> 02:22:25,710
I would go to their
special guests and watch

2817
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,740
and I saw him, his financial and I
told Jean like, this kid can be good.

2818
02:22:28,770 --> 02:22:32,760
He trained up on the walkie but not Rufus
support. Right. Shaffer's at the time.

2819
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:33,880
Yeah,
and I saw him.

2820
02:22:33,890 --> 02:22:36,900
I used to go down and train with her
now watching him a hidden pads and doing

2821
02:22:36,901 --> 02:22:38,880
something. He's funky. He
could me the want to go pro.

2822
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:41,760
He can be a champion and they should
have his first fight went the way it did.

2823
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:44,310
And then Kelly, I remember seeing
him in a hotel like Montel.

2824
02:22:44,311 --> 02:22:47,230
Let me highlights your fast like you know,
I know you got an sr,

2825
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:50,640
you fight bro Quadro and do what
you do. You're, you're fucking good.

2826
02:22:50,641 --> 02:22:52,950
Like hit this dude as much as you can.
When he fired the shot,

2827
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,230
get as a mission and you can't
fish with ground and pound.

2828
02:22:55,231 --> 02:22:57,590
You could finish this dude
like I got you bro. Thank you.

2829
02:22:57,650 --> 02:23:00,360
You are not doing it in the back. I was
like, man, I was surprised. Like I'm not,

2830
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:04,590
I knew that. I seen what he's done in the
gym. I know what he can do. He's special.

2831
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:05,521
He really is.
He's,

2832
02:23:05,521 --> 02:23:09,240
he's got real potential but he
doesn't freak me out as much as his,

2833
02:23:09,450 --> 02:23:12,960
as Brandon Davis turns away, looks healthy
at his way. Yeah. Brandon, David's like,

2834
02:23:12,961 --> 02:23:17,490
I couldn't believe that he ever weighed
one 35 when I'm looking at him like,

2835
02:23:17,491 --> 02:23:21,840
do you so big for that weight? And he was
45 before that and apparently they pie.

2836
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:23,370
Do you have seed performance institute?

2837
02:23:23,610 --> 02:23:26,190
They're the ones who talked him
into going to 35 they'll look,

2838
02:23:26,191 --> 02:23:27,024
you could make the cut.

2839
02:23:27,570 --> 02:23:31,470
He was more than one 60 when he weighed
in when he was in the octagon and that

2840
02:23:31,471 --> 02:23:33,120
means, yeah, I heard him
say I'm about one six now.

2841
02:23:33,220 --> 02:23:35,940
Then the pis that he can make it.
That's good because when I went there,

2842
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:38,520
because at one point coming
off the Osp or Jimmy,

2843
02:23:38,521 --> 02:23:41,850
I can't remember mark and then was like,
oh he always thinking about 85

2844
02:23:43,410 --> 02:23:46,600
that's how close your mouth. 300 pounds.
Like, well maybe like I tried to test cut,

2845
02:23:46,601 --> 02:23:48,210
didn't go well but not a is here.

2846
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:51,990
So I emailed them and went out there
and we did a test and Clinton both said,

2847
02:23:52,050 --> 02:23:54,930
well Clinton,
both of them just get stronger cleaner.

2848
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:57,180
Like I don't tell you right now. Crossing
and numbers compare to other numbers.

2849
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:01,140
You walk around smaller, but when you put
your on a system, your numbers is like,

2850
02:24:01,410 --> 02:24:04,770
you're like gleaner the most of these
guys. I mean you can make 80 bucks,

2851
02:24:04,771 --> 02:24:07,380
you're probably like die. Like it
wouldn't be healthy at all. You,

2852
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:10,860
it wouldn't be worth it. Well, so
many guys like Dustin poor, Yay.

2853
02:24:11,070 --> 02:24:13,060
So many guys going up in weight class,

2854
02:24:13,061 --> 02:24:15,280
but in the best thing that's
ever happened to them. So, um,

2855
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:18,660
Jorge Mas fuddled so many guys that
go up to 70, they just look better.

2856
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:22,980
Robert Whitaker Whitaker is
perfect. Champ champ. Yeah, I mean,

2857
02:24:22,981 --> 02:24:24,370
I think that it's a,

2858
02:24:24,990 --> 02:24:29,400
it's a bad environment when there's 20
pound weight gaps between like 85 and two

2859
02:24:29,401 --> 02:24:32,760
oh five or even 15 between 55 and 70.

2860
02:24:32,761 --> 02:24:34,500
These are giant wake gaps.

2861
02:24:35,590 --> 02:24:38,850
You've got the name from two
oh five to 85 that's 20 pounds.

2862
02:24:39,330 --> 02:24:42,600
You can make it like you did you see
me when I'm on a scale of 12 five now?

2863
02:24:42,670 --> 02:24:46,670
It ain't like I'm still flat. Like my
dad's was popping like my cheekbones.

2864
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:51,030
I'm looking at a 20 zero pounds. Oh,
you'd be a dead man. Dead Man. I mean,

2865
02:24:51,031 --> 02:24:53,910
you'd have to literally like
do something to your body.

2866
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:57,730
Like you'd have to run around
the streets is bring people.

2867
02:24:57,731 --> 02:25:01,020
It's finding like 20 miles a day.
Brandon Davis before that fight.

2868
02:25:01,050 --> 02:25:04,050
That's car person cause
he was a big 85 or yeah,

2869
02:25:04,060 --> 02:25:05,520
he fought two oh five I'm contingent,

2870
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:10,110
but he wasn't like solid at 25 two or
five you can see he's still had more body

2871
02:25:10,111 --> 02:25:13,500
fat so it can get all, I remember
when I was a pianist, so I'm like,

2872
02:25:13,501 --> 02:25:16,680
you're going to become like a marathon
runner. Just can't, what do you mean?

2873
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:19,590
And they gave him his meal plan.
It's like very small meals,

2874
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:24,070
which you got around like five to
three to six miles a day. And then bike

2875
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:27,820
after that another 10 15 at night.
So that's what we was doing.

2876
02:25:27,850 --> 02:25:30,100
Like Sunday hit me up like you're ready,
go to the park.

2877
02:25:30,310 --> 02:25:32,170
I would go bike 15 miles and I leave.

2878
02:25:32,171 --> 02:25:35,020
He go run the thing in the five
mile lubricant. They briars fucker.

2879
02:25:35,021 --> 02:25:37,990
He's our hatch if I want to make weight.
But now he's got it down pat.

2880
02:25:37,991 --> 02:25:39,130
So he doesn't have do to anymore.

2881
02:25:39,150 --> 02:25:42,110
We had to get his body to where he's
supposed to be walking around like two oh

2882
02:25:42,111 --> 02:25:46,840
five to 10 Max lean. So when you came
to camp, a good two three mile run,

2883
02:25:46,910 --> 02:25:48,620
get them down to a one night.

2884
02:25:48,621 --> 02:25:52,340
It's just like eat right and train and
then suck the last few pounds. Yes,

2885
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:53,200
certain people like that,

2886
02:25:53,201 --> 02:25:56,740
but like when you see me I got to see
like next to glow rest my really pay

2887
02:25:56,741 --> 02:25:57,280
attention to it.

2888
02:25:57,280 --> 02:26:01,300
When I came in at two 36 on two weeks
notice we look about the same and we got

2889
02:26:01,310 --> 02:26:04,050
on a scale or when we did the face,
I know we turned side with it.

2890
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:06,750
You kind of see like he's thinner,
but I got home,

2891
02:26:06,780 --> 02:26:11,410
my torso and everything is thick because
that was 300 pounds at one point.

2892
02:26:11,770 --> 02:26:15,520
I don't lose that for everything about
heavyweight in the UFC mark and said it

2893
02:26:15,521 --> 02:26:17,230
before.
Even say like Bro,

2894
02:26:17,380 --> 02:26:22,380
the way 85 two oh five and heavyweight
85 it's like two oh five hours.

2895
02:26:22,691 --> 02:26:24,160
That's a little smaller faster,

2896
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:27,370
but they don't hit as far as hard as
they do in two oh five and heavyweight.

2897
02:26:27,371 --> 02:26:28,150
They hit hard,

2898
02:26:28,150 --> 02:26:31,570
but they're a lot slower and faster
than two oh five so you can go up and I

2899
02:26:31,571 --> 02:26:33,670
think you'll still do great.
And if you go down,

2900
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,150
I think if you rehydrate it right back up,
you just go through everybody.

2901
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:39,970
But I like to have five.
Like I said,

2902
02:26:39,971 --> 02:26:42,670
I haven't been dominated until somebody
showed me. I don't need to be here.

2903
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:44,280
I'm not going anywhere.
Well,

2904
02:26:44,290 --> 02:26:46,900
especially when you're walking around
at two 35 that's really the weight class

2905
02:26:46,901 --> 02:26:51,430
for it. Yeah. Like I said, feel
great. Oh, I'm healthy weight. Yeah.

2906
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:55,360
My fuck around at the heavyweight division
is so strange too because it's got a

2907
02:26:55,361 --> 02:26:59,350
weight limit, like two 65 always weirded
me out. Like why is there a weight limit?

2908
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:04,030
Like there should probably be a two 25
and then there should be an unlimited,

2909
02:27:05,570 --> 02:27:07,180
you fucking get,
you know,

2910
02:27:07,181 --> 02:27:12,181
like a bunch of butterballs is rolling
around and tells him be born or giant

2911
02:27:12,461 --> 02:27:15,220
dudes like in Ghana that don't
even have to cut weight. You know?

2912
02:27:15,630 --> 02:27:18,940
You know like Curtis blaze. I know he
was a big one where he came in. Yeah.

2913
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,020
I recruited him in college and I seen
him in high school. He was big. Then, uh,

2914
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:25,870
who's another one? Um, won something.

2915
02:27:25,871 --> 02:27:29,750
He just came in from the contender light
skinned dude with the Afro. Real crazy.

2916
02:27:29,780 --> 02:27:32,710
He fought in Milwaukee,
the Milwaukee car heavyweight.

2917
02:27:32,711 --> 02:27:34,690
He fought my buddy and the contender,

2918
02:27:34,930 --> 02:27:38,400
they went out there three weeks before
and he was like two 90, something,

2919
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:40,960
three or four.
My teammate was like two 50 already.

2920
02:27:41,410 --> 02:27:44,050
Not something my brothers ain't
gonna be no regional fight.

2921
02:27:44,051 --> 02:27:47,380
You need to come ready. This
dude is huge. When he hit you,

2922
02:27:47,381 --> 02:27:49,960
he's hitting you and if he gets you
to the ground, he's donkey Kong.

2923
02:27:49,961 --> 02:27:52,300
He has seen film on him in Kurdish blades.

2924
02:27:52,310 --> 02:27:56,390
Hit me up about him when he first started
fighting pro and it has seen film,

2925
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:58,790
not sound like I seen film,
but looking at how big this kit is,

2926
02:27:58,791 --> 02:28:01,360
it's not going to be a fight you used to.
And sure enough,

2927
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:04,870
I think my God took it like
he was like, oh, he's big,

2928
02:28:04,871 --> 02:28:08,260
but he's not going to be as fast
as me. Shit. He rehydrating up,

2929
02:28:08,261 --> 02:28:11,860
but he would athletic. It's, Oh
that was not a fight to watch.

2930
02:28:12,130 --> 02:28:15,880
But lessons learned.
Yeah. Now if you could,

2931
02:28:15,940 --> 02:28:18,910
if you were running shit of Corie
Anderson's president of the UFC,

2932
02:28:18,911 --> 02:28:23,270
what would you change? The rankings.
The rankings go back to where it was.

2933
02:28:23,271 --> 02:28:26,330
If you beat this guy, you move
up. Why did they do it now?

2934
02:28:26,331 --> 02:28:29,630
They do it based on like having no journal
runs it. Yeah, something like that.

2935
02:28:29,631 --> 02:28:32,760
Something like that. A bunch of Jews
vote for it. That's what they say. Yeah.

2936
02:28:32,890 --> 02:28:33,980
And in my mind I feel like,

2937
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:36,410
I think somebody in the UFC still
has something to do with it,

2938
02:28:36,411 --> 02:28:38,900
but they swear up and down and every
time I say something I'll be like,

2939
02:28:38,901 --> 02:28:40,370
it's not them bro.
Somebody else.

2940
02:28:40,371 --> 02:28:44,450
But I don't know cause even mc after
the glow or fight, he told me like, Bro,

2941
02:28:44,700 --> 02:28:47,120
hello fight. Thank you for stepping in.
And you'd definitely be in the top five.

2942
02:28:47,310 --> 02:28:49,460
And I said in the interview
like I should be top five,

2943
02:28:49,461 --> 02:28:50,510
I got to feel it and I won't be.

2944
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:52,880
And everybody an interview
like that sounds crazy. You
just be the number three,

2945
02:28:52,881 --> 02:28:56,370
your death would be top five. Wednesday
came out, number six. If it was really,

2946
02:28:56,510 --> 02:28:58,130
how does that make sense then
not be a leader. It's like,

2947
02:28:58,131 --> 02:28:59,600
oh there's no question you'll be top files

2948
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:02,830
I think starts going great for
you and growing the right way.

2949
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:05,680
Do you think you'd be like, well what
the fuck am I fighting against now?

2950
02:29:05,870 --> 02:29:08,870
No, that's why I made a tweet
that somebody posted before.

2951
02:29:08,871 --> 02:29:11,870
Like I'm just saying how Cory steady
dropping down the rankings when you got

2952
02:29:11,871 --> 02:29:13,020
guys like dominant wrist,

2953
02:29:13,021 --> 02:29:16,270
he beat Volcom who was four and everybody
saying he lost that fight but he's

2954
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:18,230
Volcom was six actually
or something like that.

2955
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:21,980
He lost that fight but he's jumped up
to four like how has he he off decision

2956
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:23,780
like oh it's cause you
lose or win on decision.

2957
02:29:23,781 --> 02:29:26,480
They don't move rankings up for decision.
Then he went off decision.

2958
02:29:26,481 --> 02:29:29,270
He went up to number four and somebody
said how did that even possible?

2959
02:29:29,271 --> 02:29:32,240
I said it's to the point now I can't
worry about fighting hoopers and charges

2960
02:29:32,241 --> 02:29:35,060
the rankings and my opponent.
Cause if I worry about both of them,

2961
02:29:35,061 --> 02:29:36,110
I'm not focused on something.

2962
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:38,600
So I'm just worried about the opponent
and I'm going to keep beating whoever

2963
02:29:38,601 --> 02:29:39,434
they put in front of me.

2964
02:29:39,590 --> 02:29:43,160
And eventually they keep trying to put
these guys up to fight John like off

2965
02:29:43,161 --> 02:29:46,490
knock outs. Like I said, Andrew
Smith, he knocked out Rashad, uh,

2966
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:50,720
shogun and then choked out Vulcan.
He went up there to USC, John,

2967
02:29:50,780 --> 02:29:52,550
it didn't have nothing to ground.
All that extra stuff.

2968
02:29:52,820 --> 02:29:54,850
It's good when you're knocking guys out.
And I think somebody,

2969
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:57,950
same thing with Santo, he known for
knocking guys out, but his losses,

2970
02:29:58,630 --> 02:30:02,120
I'm an 85 other than branch.
He also Eric Spicy on the ground.

2971
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:04,340
John's good on the garage.
I was going to take them down.

2972
02:30:04,350 --> 02:30:06,340
Soon as you come running to me,
you hit him one shot,

2973
02:30:06,341 --> 02:30:08,060
I'm going to take you down and
he ain't gonna have no answer.

2974
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:09,050
You know what I mean?

2975
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:12,850
If you don't have everything tested by
the time when it's time to go to the

2976
02:30:12,860 --> 02:30:15,950
championship fight, if you ain't
do nothing, striking is over.

2977
02:30:16,130 --> 02:30:19,580
Tiago to me seems like,
I mean he's a very dangerous guy,

2978
02:30:19,970 --> 02:30:24,200
but almost like so aggressive that
he's almost like a kamikaze guy.

2979
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,930
Like he's do or die
like kill or be killed.

2980
02:30:26,931 --> 02:30:30,920
He comes in just swinging and
throwing hammers and if he connects,

2981
02:30:30,921 --> 02:30:34,670
it's dangerous. If you can ask is bad
for everybody, but he might not connect.

2982
02:30:34,700 --> 02:30:38,630
You know? I mean it's, it's, that's
kind of how he is. He's, he's a,

2983
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:41,630
he's a a wild card.
That's the best way to put it.

2984
02:30:41,631 --> 02:30:46,631
Like he could connect on John if John
fucks around and I don't think you will.

2985
02:30:46,790 --> 02:30:50,210
I think, I mean he hasn't ever before
except for the Gustafson fight.

2986
02:30:50,211 --> 02:30:51,980
I don't think he was prepared
as much as he should have.

2987
02:30:52,190 --> 02:30:54,740
And we saw that in the second
fight where he just dominated him.

2988
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:57,560
But I think that if he makes a mistake,

2989
02:30:57,710 --> 02:31:01,280
Tiago could shut the lights out
on anybody. That guy has swings,

2990
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:03,430
he throws like it's less sledgehammer.

2991
02:31:03,470 --> 02:31:05,720
Even rose is not trying to
make it to the final round.

2992
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:10,100
Like he's not pacing themselves, does none
of that. That dude, he comes out hard.

2993
02:31:10,390 --> 02:31:10,920
But it's like

2994
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:14,250
I think about him as my fight. We are a
little bit Chiefy going into that fight.

2995
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:17,820
We, I knew 100% I live, he's going to try
rest of me, but if it can't take me now,

2996
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:20,670
everything is going to be haymakers cause
he seen me get touched in the Chan and

2997
02:31:20,671 --> 02:31:24,660
go down a robble. So as long as I
keep moving, if I make him miss,

2998
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:27,900
he's going to get tired and he's going
to stop throwing those big haymakers.

2999
02:31:28,140 --> 02:31:29,490
And sometimes when he's swinging,
he missed,

3000
02:31:29,491 --> 02:31:32,940
he almost falls over and it gives you
like the counter or to take down this

3001
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:34,800
thing and our division,
there's so many people,

3002
02:31:35,310 --> 02:31:38,340
not more like rock 'em sock 'em robots I
think cause they got their hands up and

3003
02:31:38,341 --> 02:31:41,460
they blocking and it's like, oh he's not
hitting me. But with four ounce gloves,

3004
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,630
I guess I'll put it like I was case half
a Ryan Bader and John's Anthony Johnson

3005
02:31:46,170 --> 02:31:48,690
Bader had his hands up.
Borama was hit his hand so hard.

3006
02:31:48,890 --> 02:31:50,850
Also you see his hands
just drop and he was out.

3007
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:55,620
It doesn't matter if you let them hit
you is a chance to still getting wobbled.

3008
02:31:55,621 --> 02:31:56,460
And I think with John,

3009
02:31:56,461 --> 02:32:01,300
John's good at Aveda and punches most
guys in our block and counter back or try

3010
02:32:01,301 --> 02:32:03,870
to take a punch and hit you back.
Like take a punch to give a punch.

3011
02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:06,960
John's not that car. He's
going to move, move, move.

3012
02:32:06,970 --> 02:32:10,590
You swing he so long he can put his hands
out and keep your distance and hit you

3013
02:32:10,591 --> 02:32:14,970
with those quick fast long kicks and
stuff. And I just, like you said,

3014
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,970
I don't see John Messing around.
He knows his dangerous. He's smart.

3015
02:32:18,110 --> 02:32:21,990
I will say John's not only the best
fighter if he's in mentally as a mixed

3016
02:32:21,991 --> 02:32:26,040
martial artist, he sees what's going
on really well. He knows how to debt.

3017
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:29,730
He can go out there and try tricky stuff
at times when he know I can try some

3018
02:32:29,731 --> 02:32:32,820
stuff right here and get away with it
cause I'm long like with shogun fight.

3019
02:32:32,821 --> 02:32:34,470
And he went out there and
showed out jumping knees,

3020
02:32:34,471 --> 02:32:37,800
jumping to kicks because Shogun
was so short. He knew. He said,

3021
02:32:37,890 --> 02:32:41,370
I'm a different breed. I'm longer on fast
and trickier, but I think it would come.

3022
02:32:41,371 --> 02:32:43,050
A guy like Gus,
he didn't do all that stuff,

3023
02:32:43,051 --> 02:32:46,500
but he knew he had to stay long in the
vape punches and get the take down and

3024
02:32:46,501 --> 02:32:50,060
hit them where you can. Yeah. And the
Gus fight, he showed his metal, right.

3025
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:53,070
It showed that he could take it and then
winning the championship rounds even in

3026
02:32:53,071 --> 02:32:55,320
the fight that it wasn't even
really properly prepared for.

3027
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:57,740
He showed that in the Vito Belfort
fight too when he got caught.

3028
02:32:57,741 --> 02:33:01,290
But that arm bar, he overcomes
adversity. He's not just the hammer.

3029
02:33:01,291 --> 02:33:05,820
He knows how to be the nail. He knows
how to do it. Uh, well listen Corey,

3030
02:33:06,270 --> 02:33:09,590
you're a bad mother fucker. I appreciate
you coming here. It's just fun. It's fun.

3031
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:13,530
You want to talk on more? We did
three hours, man, but we talk all MMA.

3032
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:18,560
Let's get 30 minutes. 30 minutes.
Let's do it. I was like, Huh,

3033
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:20,670
okay, let's talk. It's
fine if I'm a hunter.

3034
02:33:21,650 --> 02:33:24,350
But who you told me you're going on your
first elk hunting trip this year. Yep.

3035
02:33:24,690 --> 02:33:27,990
Getting out to Montana. We're part.
Is it around? I can't remember.

3036
02:33:29,510 --> 02:33:32,610
He gave me the codes to put into the,
the DNR site.

3037
02:33:32,710 --> 02:33:35,740
Are you using a different sectors? You
use it. A light set up out there for it,

3038
02:33:35,750 --> 02:33:39,860
but that's for target right here.
I got 60 pounds,

3039
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:44,610
just like 62 or 63 and how many greens
arrows you still have like to 60 yeah,

3040
02:33:44,611 --> 02:33:48,430
that's a really light Arrow I'll use when
I go out there for Elka and I use you

3041
02:33:48,431 --> 02:33:53,430
to 300 so I got the grizzly stick weighted
tips, whatever, 300 grains, that's it.

3042
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:54,600
That's what usually what I shoot.

3043
02:33:55,830 --> 02:34:00,750
I shoot five 25 525 grains.
I should pull 84 pounds.

3044
02:34:01,440 --> 02:34:05,160
I like uh, the tip and everything
and I don't know what it is,

3045
02:34:05,161 --> 02:34:07,260
but the answer is 300 wait,

3046
02:34:07,590 --> 02:34:10,350
wouldn't have with everything
I have to get to scale.

3047
02:34:10,350 --> 02:34:12,540
I'll make my own arrows and the
basement and all that, but I just,

3048
02:34:12,820 --> 02:34:16,080
I don't have a scale to see how much
your way at the end are you trying to do

3049
02:34:16,081 --> 02:34:20,560
that for speed is why you have the light
grains. That's just what the guy, my guy,

3050
02:34:20,561 --> 02:34:23,140
aces and arrows,
the hat I'm wearing actually in Vegas.

3051
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:24,990
I'm going to connect you to John Dudley.
I mean,

3052
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,260
I know you've already talked to him,

3053
02:34:26,261 --> 02:34:29,860
but I want to get you guys together next
time you anywhere near here and he's in,

3054
02:34:29,990 --> 02:34:31,780
or if you're in Vegas and he's in Vegas,

3055
02:34:31,781 --> 02:34:34,060
I'm going to get you guys together
and have them coach you and help you.

3056
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:37,270
Cause I already,
I already see that you're very accurate.

3057
02:34:37,570 --> 02:34:41,560
You know when we're playing techno haunt
you or your scoring in the vitals every

3058
02:34:41,561 --> 02:34:46,300
single time, you know, except for one,
one little window by one body shop.

3059
02:34:46,300 --> 02:34:48,730
But even that's a dead elk where he,
where he hit it.

3060
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,850
But John can help you
tremendously. He, he'll,

3061
02:34:51,970 --> 02:34:55,360
he'll tighten up your shit and I'll
show it that. I see his videos.

3062
02:34:55,361 --> 02:34:59,350
I studied that stuff all the
time. But again, he's like
the Mark Henry of archery.

3063
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:00,660
I see it.
Yeah.

3064
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:04,450
And hundred yard shot through
the Kettlebell and I'll
tell a friend all the time,

3065
02:35:04,451 --> 02:35:07,210
like I was the most amazing thing I've
ever seen. That whole, this big yard.

3066
02:35:07,450 --> 02:35:09,870
He went through an error only book.
Yup.

3067
02:35:10,090 --> 02:35:13,060
It's like you don't see people
shooting like cam is good too,

3068
02:35:13,061 --> 02:35:15,960
but I'm not saying he couldn't do it,
but I don't camp could do it too.

3069
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:19,310
They have a Canada post videos
shooting through kettlebells lessons,

3070
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:20,800
like some crazy videos too.

3071
02:35:20,801 --> 02:35:24,610
But I mean it's just that level of
commitment where they're just constantly

3072
02:35:24,611 --> 02:35:29,140
training, constantly doing. And John
is also just such a fantastic coach,

3073
02:35:29,470 --> 02:35:29,711
you know,

3074
02:35:29,711 --> 02:35:34,410
he's so good at understanding our true
fundamentals and explaining it to you.

3075
02:35:34,670 --> 02:35:38,980
The positioning and it's very much like
martial arts and that we would make a

3076
02:35:38,981 --> 02:35:43,870
few little changes and it does the world
of difference. I'm willing to learn.

3077
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:47,200
Yeah. Most of the time I'm learning
on the fly. Like on my dad,

3078
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:50,090
we learned how to shoot together and
I was like 12 when it was buddies,

3079
02:35:50,150 --> 02:35:52,510
like all you ever did
archery took him to the rain.

3080
02:35:52,530 --> 02:35:56,830
She got me a browning and I was a
kid, you know, shooting it at three,

3081
02:35:56,831 --> 02:35:59,650
shooting with him. It's kind of like
what I learned was from what he learned.

3082
02:36:00,130 --> 02:36:02,530
But if you know my dad,
everything other than work,

3083
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:05,620
everything is Kinda like ghetto
guys are calling the ghetto Cabo.

3084
02:36:05,621 --> 02:36:08,800
We had horses and everything
and it was just like, do I,

3085
02:36:08,801 --> 02:36:12,370
you see people do it on TV when I was
not the way my dad learned how to ranch

3086
02:36:12,371 --> 02:36:12,781
horses,

3087
02:36:12,781 --> 02:36:16,810
it grabbed voices and saddle him up and
everything was kind of ghetto be ghetto

3088
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:21,310
cowboy, you know. So now when I go back
from the things I learned and I tell him,

3089
02:36:21,670 --> 02:36:23,440
cause like you say, you see
my answer, I'm all hunting,

3090
02:36:23,770 --> 02:36:25,660
thank fight and I'm hunting constantly.
He was like,

3091
02:36:25,661 --> 02:36:28,510
where did you learn is it's just watching
videos and I go hunting with somebody

3092
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:32,440
else's instead of talking like I talk
about what I know but most honest and I

3093
02:36:32,441 --> 02:36:34,950
listened to guys talk and
I ask a question like yeah,

3094
02:36:35,080 --> 02:36:37,210
like I don't know what it is but
I make it seem like I do. But yes.

3095
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:38,800
What are you thinking about that?
And they break it down.

3096
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:41,830
I had no clue about that.
Learn how to feel.

3097
02:36:41,831 --> 02:36:45,130
Address my first deer in Texas
with these guys, Harold Sports,

3098
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:48,010
a bunch of veterans would go out.
They asked me and Justin Gates you,

3099
02:36:48,011 --> 02:36:50,440
that's how I got close with
Gigi hunting with those guys.

3100
02:36:50,830 --> 02:36:53,590
Well with veterans with amputate your leg,
so mental problems,

3101
02:36:53,591 --> 02:36:56,020
whatever is this and say
store and we kill a deer.

3102
02:36:56,050 --> 02:36:57,310
Like they've been hunting they whole life.

3103
02:36:57,340 --> 02:37:02,180
They grew up as kids so feel addressing
and how to call and like you shooting

3104
02:37:02,181 --> 02:37:02,711
the rifle.
I'm like,

3105
02:37:02,711 --> 02:37:06,940
oh you go to this website and
if you got 110 granted a bullet,

3106
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:10,670
it shows you here at 300 yards.
Aim on this cross here and didn't like,

3107
02:37:10,671 --> 02:37:12,490
and I learned different
stuff from those guys.

3108
02:37:12,491 --> 02:37:13,920
Veterans that do this stuff for a living.

3109
02:37:13,921 --> 02:37:17,540
They ain't had been to war and
how to shoot a gun then God,

3110
02:37:17,541 --> 02:37:20,690
these are like John does.
I see his videos and his uh,

3111
02:37:20,691 --> 02:37:24,170
not school and Knox and would not
watch stuff like that. Like you said,

3112
02:37:24,171 --> 02:37:25,040
you haven't had any coaching.

3113
02:37:25,041 --> 02:37:30,041
Like what I'd do is just practice over
and over and over and I'm at the range,

3114
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:32,680
the owner Mike of a. And. M,
he'll come out and be like, oh,

3115
02:37:32,690 --> 02:37:35,480
kind of tried to turn your head a little
bit more. I didn't have a kisser button.

3116
02:37:35,481 --> 02:37:36,314
Put a kiss with button though,

3117
02:37:36,340 --> 02:37:39,250
that have forced you to turn your head
and you need to be strict with the law.

3118
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:43,550
Straight down and think about pushing
his lifeline through stuff like that.

3119
02:37:43,551 --> 02:37:44,990
I just practice,
I guess I'm shooting.

3120
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:47,090
I used to shoot at least
a hundred barrels a day.

3121
02:37:47,570 --> 02:37:50,870
I guess I'll pop that chuck bit down,
put the radio on your sat there and shoot.

3122
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:55,610
I shot one time so long I couldn't move
my neck back the next morning and I woke

3123
02:37:55,611 --> 02:37:56,420
up.
I could not.

3124
02:37:56,420 --> 02:38:00,230
I was stuck like I didn't even train
because I was stuck in my head turned like

3125
02:38:00,231 --> 02:38:03,530
this cause my Kay got tight because I
was crunching up here and doing this like

3126
02:38:03,531 --> 02:38:07,020
I wasn't supposed to, but it all
tightened up. Yeah, I mean, you know,

3127
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:10,820
so I'm learning the hard way. She was
like, I went Turkey hunting this year,

3128
02:38:11,180 --> 02:38:15,140
this last week. Archery Turkey.
Never Been Turkey hunting before.

3129
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:17,910
I've only seen on youtube or hurt
somebody telling me at the trade show the

3130
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:20,390
great American outdoors.
And it just sounds so interesting.

3131
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:22,130
And I started youtube in
an ordered all this stuff.

3132
02:38:22,131 --> 02:38:25,790
I need decoys and I was teaching myself
watching videos. Knock the first day,

3133
02:38:25,791 --> 02:38:28,430
I slayed, call him boss
call. I don't know.

3134
02:38:28,431 --> 02:38:31,730
That's not right now I can do that now.

3135
02:38:31,731 --> 02:38:34,440
I'll put it on the slate and it
sounded like an actual Turkey call.

3136
02:38:34,441 --> 02:38:37,710
And like I'm good in a week.
I just study in Sra. Right?

3137
02:38:37,820 --> 02:38:40,790
So stuff like that.
So I just look forward,

3138
02:38:41,180 --> 02:38:45,860
fuck with those heck suits. The who
heck suit. You know what it is? Agcs,

3139
02:38:46,470 --> 02:38:49,770
it's a, especially with
birds, birds, you know,

3140
02:38:49,771 --> 02:38:53,550
birds can navigate using
magnetics. They, they use,

3141
02:38:53,610 --> 02:38:57,510
they use like the magnetic pole
to and electromagnetic fields.

3142
02:38:57,511 --> 02:39:01,980
It's been proven that birds can
register and they see electric sense

3143
02:39:02,010 --> 02:39:06,300
electromagnetic fields. And they
think that birds in particular and,

3144
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:10,440
and sea creatures too,
like they use it with a scuba divers and,

3145
02:39:10,740 --> 02:39:12,660
and a spear fisherman
and people like that.

3146
02:39:13,050 --> 02:39:18,050
There's a suit that blocks
the electromagnetic signal
that your body gives off.

3147
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:24,000
And uh, it's put supposedly particularly
effective with Turkeys who, you know,

3148
02:39:24,001 --> 02:39:25,110
are very,

3149
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:29,070
they see very well and they see
things movement and they're very,

3150
02:39:29,071 --> 02:39:32,730
very skiddish and they see any weird shit.
They just get the fuck out of there.

3151
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:37,110
But, um, this guy, Mike's linkerd, who's
one of the guys who created the heck suit,

3152
02:39:37,380 --> 02:39:39,690
he hunts turkeys with no blind.

3153
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:43,830
He just sits out in the field with
this heck suit on that blocks the

3154
02:39:43,831 --> 02:39:45,510
electromagnet magnetic signal.

3155
02:39:45,511 --> 02:39:48,900
And then he puts cammo on over the heck
suit and has videos of him doing this.

3156
02:39:48,901 --> 02:39:52,460
Man, it's Kinda crazy. You
know, this is a check. Yeah,

3157
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:53,910
this is him sitting there.

3158
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:58,710
So he's sitting with his heck suit on
right in front of these turkeys. Now,

3159
02:39:58,711 --> 02:40:03,030
you know as well as I know that most of
the time if you are right in front of a

3160
02:40:03,031 --> 02:40:03,781
Turkey like that,

3161
02:40:03,781 --> 02:40:08,480
they would get the fuck out
of Dodge Dakota put over.

3162
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:12,380
But he's not, he doesn't have that.
They don't got the coin is hey, yeah,

3163
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:16,860
I mean he's got somebody behind the giant
body behind them and he's, he's moving.

3164
02:40:17,370 --> 02:40:21,830
But the idea is that it can't see the
electromagnetic signal that you're giving

3165
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:24,960
off. There's a lot of videos on
it. It's super controversial,

3166
02:40:25,410 --> 02:40:29,010
but a Dudley swears by it.
John Dudley swears by,

3167
02:40:29,011 --> 02:40:33,630
and a lot of other folks do too. Um,
Shane Dorian. Yeah, I think it does.

3168
02:40:33,631 --> 02:40:37,740
I think it works for everything. I think
animals can sense something. I mean,

3169
02:40:37,741 --> 02:40:40,110
it's not everything, right? I mean,

3170
02:40:40,111 --> 02:40:44,220
you still can't be downwind or
upwind, you know, if, if you,

3171
02:40:44,430 --> 02:40:46,770
if your wind comes and catches them,

3172
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:49,140
they're going to smell you and they're
going to get the fuck out of there.

3173
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:54,120
But it's a, what is that
another? Just Jesus Christ.

3174
02:40:54,840 --> 02:40:58,980
That's a great picture. Like there's
a perfect example of how camera works,

3175
02:40:59,490 --> 02:41:00,600
right?
That picture.

3176
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:04,110
It's true. But you gotta if you to like
that picture of me, you tried that,

3177
02:41:04,140 --> 02:41:04,973
you're going to see me.

3178
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:10,560
Perfect angle. And the filters, I
mean it's the perfect type of leaves,

3179
02:41:10,561 --> 02:41:13,500
the perfect gang goal, the
perfect lighting, you know,

3180
02:41:13,510 --> 02:41:15,840
it's probably fucked with a
little, but you know, the,

3181
02:41:15,841 --> 02:41:17,850
the heck suit is a very
controversial thing,

3182
02:41:17,851 --> 02:41:20,430
but people smarter than me say it works.

3183
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:24,950
It really works with sea
creatures for some reason with um,

3184
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:27,660
a things in the water because you know,
animals,

3185
02:41:27,661 --> 02:41:32,410
they have that lateral line or fish
rather have that lateral line and they,

3186
02:41:32,420 --> 02:41:37,320
they sense electrical signals that are
coming off of creatures that are in the

3187
02:41:37,321 --> 02:41:41,670
water. And so scuba divers
swear by this fucking the suit.

3188
02:41:42,750 --> 02:41:46,410
It's interesting stuff. Yeah, heard
it. Never heard. I'm like, wait,

3189
02:41:46,470 --> 02:41:50,250
I'll get them to send you some.
Yeah, for sure. Well, like I said,

3190
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:53,010
I listened to Dudley when it comes to
every, I'm, you know, I'm like you,

3191
02:41:53,011 --> 02:41:57,420
when it comes to martial arts,
if someone's teaching me something,

3192
02:41:57,421 --> 02:41:59,370
I just listen. I don't,
I don't second gas.

3193
02:41:59,371 --> 02:42:03,600
And when a guy is wise is him says
that it works. I'm curious about it

3194
02:42:03,700 --> 02:42:06,200
and at least try it before I
knock. We don't work for me. Not,

3195
02:42:06,340 --> 02:42:09,820
maybe it's just I'm doing something wrong
and they come and show me and it still

3196
02:42:09,821 --> 02:42:11,740
don't work. It's Kinda like a,
I don't believe it. If it works,

3197
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:16,710
I'm going to have a particular, uh,
Cammo company. CIC is the best. Yeah.

3198
02:42:16,711 --> 02:42:20,230
I love it there. The best. I mean, I got,
they gave me a little pro deal 50% off,

3199
02:42:21,450 --> 02:42:25,210
so I worked out. Yeah, I love it. It's
still expensive, but it's worth it. Yeah.

3200
02:42:25,330 --> 02:42:25,610
They,

3201
02:42:25,610 --> 02:42:29,410
they just have so much engineering and
their shit and guys like John Barklow,

3202
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:33,650
the guy who was the designer that does
all the protesting and cold weather and

3203
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:37,370
you ever see the cold water immersion
test they've done with their shit.

3204
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:42,410
He's got a rewarming drill that he put
online explaining to people what you do

3205
02:42:42,411 --> 02:42:45,290
if you're in cold conditions
and you fall into the water,

3206
02:42:45,291 --> 02:42:47,900
like how to rewarm yourselves
got ahold video where he did it,

3207
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:51,620
they jumped into this icy
river and then yet, nope.

3208
02:42:52,520 --> 02:42:55,050
And then climbed out. And you know, the,

3209
02:42:55,051 --> 02:42:59,180
the suits are designed in a lot of the
clothing is designed to allow you to

3210
02:42:59,181 --> 02:43:01,610
survive and that sort of a situation.
But you know,

3211
02:43:01,611 --> 02:43:03,440
you have to know how to do
it and how to go about it.

3212
02:43:03,441 --> 02:43:08,120
So he hears there's John and uh, this
guy that he's with and they just dumped,

3213
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:11,920
there's John on the right and they'd dump
themselves in this freezing water and

3214
02:43:11,921 --> 02:43:16,330
then get out. And then they
put on sleeping bags and
gotten into the tent. And

3215
02:43:17,210 --> 02:43:21,000
I'm tell you right now that's been WPS to,
ah,

3216
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:25,970
you're not going to see no black
man. Don't beat yourself. No.

3217
02:43:26,060 --> 02:43:28,060
All waters is the proof

3218
02:43:33,750 --> 02:43:34,300
point.

3219
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:38,320
Um, well he's educating people. That was
actually when he was in the military.

3220
02:43:38,321 --> 02:43:42,130
That's what he did. He taught
cold weather survival. He's,

3221
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:44,350
he's so thorough too.
And you know,

3222
02:43:44,351 --> 02:43:48,550
and he's one of the reasons why sit cause
gears so well engineered and designed

3223
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:52,660
because they've got a guy like him that's
a telling them how to design things.

3224
02:43:52,661 --> 02:43:56,800
And he's a hunter too. He hunted with me
the, uh, last year I hunted elk with him.

3225
02:43:56,801 --> 02:43:58,720
And, uh, in Utah,

3226
02:43:59,090 --> 02:44:01,730
I'm actually going to get the test out.
Like my buddy told me before, like,

3227
02:44:01,731 --> 02:44:05,420
I promise you thicker, you get the
warm and stuff, no matter how cold,

3228
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:07,520
you're not going to get cold,
like the best shit.

3229
02:44:07,580 --> 02:44:11,900
So I'm going to a Saskatchewan
can't if a white tail in November,

3230
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,880
he told me if he say it case, he's like,
it's not that bad. It's kind of car.

3231
02:44:15,881 --> 02:44:18,950
It wasn't not bad. He was like
sometimes like negative fucking back.

3232
02:44:19,380 --> 02:44:19,851
You come right.

3233
02:44:19,851 --> 02:44:22,160
Well I've got an extra body suit
for you so I'm going to get there,

3234
02:44:22,161 --> 02:44:24,940
super warm gear and try it out.
And he said, if it don't worry,

3235
02:44:24,970 --> 02:44:27,170
I'll let you use the body suit.
But yeah,

3236
02:44:27,260 --> 02:44:30,360
you might need the body suit
and Saskatchewan is fucking,

3237
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:34,190
I will test and see if it really works. I
might see your boys video, check it out.

3238
02:44:34,230 --> 02:44:38,450
That Canada, Cole's a different cold, you
know those people are hardy folks. Yeah.

3239
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:39,740
You went out there and uh,

3240
02:44:39,770 --> 02:44:43,880
June for the bear hunt and actually me
and my dad in the mornings it was cold.

3241
02:44:43,990 --> 02:44:44,930
Yeah.
And at that time,

3242
02:44:44,931 --> 02:44:48,740
day the sun come out and then we go to
the top of the mountain to the sea glass

3243
02:44:48,741 --> 02:44:52,910
and you know man fast, like instantly
hands froze. I'm in the truck in the heat.

3244
02:44:52,950 --> 02:44:57,710
He just out there chilling in his t shirt
like this is hey dude is he's doing it.

3245
02:44:57,711 --> 02:45:01,500
Yeah. Now will you, when you were up there
was that spot and stalk or yeah. Yeah.

3246
02:45:01,670 --> 02:45:05,270
So you catching them when they were coming
out of the dens and heat and we have

3247
02:45:05,271 --> 02:45:09,500
to go up to the top of the viewing point.
That's how my mouth and we look me,

3248
02:45:09,501 --> 02:45:10,011
him and my dad,

3249
02:45:10,011 --> 02:45:13,070
he had the spotting scope and we both
from Manaca cause I just look for a black

3250
02:45:13,071 --> 02:45:16,670
guy. You see some of you tell me and I
put the spine Scott scope on it and see if

3251
02:45:16,671 --> 02:45:19,340
it's a,
a style or a bear.

3252
02:45:19,341 --> 02:45:23,150
We can get half something like office
hours cut her cubs. We're not shooting us.

3253
02:45:23,151 --> 02:45:27,110
We only won't old males and it's crazy
cause it's a 30 minute drive to the top

3254
02:45:27,111 --> 02:45:30,560
of the mountain. So after we seal
it might look like it's right there.

3255
02:45:30,590 --> 02:45:33,470
It's like like an hour to get down there
and we've got a park and then we still

3256
02:45:33,471 --> 02:45:37,160
got walk 2030 minutes and hope he's
still in that area. You know what I mean?

3257
02:45:37,161 --> 02:45:40,430
And like I said, we came across elk, we
came across cougars, all kinds of stuff.

3258
02:45:40,431 --> 02:45:43,790
But you get an that bear
was gone and we hopped in,

3259
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:48,230
I back to the truck back to time and we
did it all day to like it got dark and

3260
02:45:48,231 --> 02:45:49,310
take us till midnight,

3261
02:45:49,311 --> 02:45:52,670
whatever to get home cause it was so
far into the mountains and it was great

3262
02:45:52,750 --> 02:45:57,170
like I said, but it will walk in and I
had the wrong boots. I like work boots,

3263
02:45:57,990 --> 02:46:02,170
my cat and stuff with burning the first
day. But, and I'm with the head guy is,

3264
02:46:02,180 --> 02:46:05,630
I don't like driving. I was like walking
a lot. So we did a whole lot of walk.

3265
02:46:05,900 --> 02:46:08,580
He's like, I figured you'd be a
UFC fighter, I could test you.

3266
02:46:08,620 --> 02:46:09,980
I never a guys athletic

3267
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:13,670
as you that's able to walk. Most people
are overweight or not that athletic.

3268
02:46:13,671 --> 02:46:16,040
So you want to go a little bit. It's
time to go to the trip. Like you,

3269
02:46:16,041 --> 02:46:20,740
I can test you out a lot of cardio men,
man.

3270
02:46:21,170 --> 02:46:25,360
I never been so scared in my life. This is
my mom said like Mr Overtime, 25, eight,

3271
02:46:25,370 --> 02:46:27,800
like you ain't did it mom.
It's different.

3272
02:46:27,830 --> 02:46:30,590
It's different walking up those hills
and those guys that get used to it,

3273
02:46:30,591 --> 02:46:33,890
those very specific muscles that you use
when you're constantly hiking up hills

3274
02:46:34,720 --> 02:46:39,720
that you said you did it black per home
before I did a few bow or rifle in uh,

3275
02:46:40,730 --> 02:46:45,320
north of Alberta with my friends
John and Jen, the rivets up there.

3276
02:46:45,321 --> 02:46:46,580
They got a great camp up there.

3277
02:46:46,820 --> 02:46:51,670
I just don't have the time to get
away for that many camps, you know?

3278
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:55,070
And I prefer elk hunting.
Can you do a year?

3279
02:46:56,660 --> 02:47:01,300
I'm going to do for this year,
for this year or two elk. Um, uh,

3280
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:06,300
one axis deer and one mule deer.
Now what about Saskatchewan and whitetail?

3281
02:47:06,350 --> 02:47:10,660
You seen those? Fuck, what'd you do it?
Yeah, I would do it. Yeah, we'll do it.

3282
02:47:11,380 --> 02:47:12,213
He'd do whatever.

3283
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:16,150
I can't because I do have something
scheduled in November already. Well,

3284
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:20,930
you tell me what in more than 100 a month,
I'll get divorced.

3285
02:47:21,620 --> 02:47:24,020
My kids will beat me up.
I'm on the verge of that already.

3286
02:47:25,010 --> 02:47:28,430
I'm on every morning I get up four o'clock
she just put the baby back to sleep.

3287
02:47:28,431 --> 02:47:32,420
I'm up making noise. I wish me
luck. I see you when I get back.

3288
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:36,270
I know they don't like it, man.
It's funny, but I get it. But it's,

3289
02:47:36,271 --> 02:47:38,480
it's one of those things that
just takes a lot of time.

3290
02:47:38,481 --> 02:47:40,910
Like if you're going to go on a
hunting trip, it's seven days away.

3291
02:47:41,210 --> 02:47:43,020
You know you have seven days and you're,

3292
02:47:43,021 --> 02:47:45,680
you're going to be probably somewhere
where there's no cell phone signal.

3293
02:47:46,310 --> 02:47:50,020
But for me, man, it's very
valuable for my head. I, I've,

3294
02:47:50,120 --> 02:47:52,490
I recenter out there. I get it, man.

3295
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:57,020
There's fucking animals chasing deer
and things are trying to survive and it

3296
02:47:57,021 --> 02:47:58,760
just puts everything
into perspective for me.

3297
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:04,180
When I'm sneaking up on an elk and I'm
tip toeing through the grass and I'm just

3298
02:48:05,481 --> 02:48:09,260
trying to get inside of like 60 70 yards
just to get a good shot off and I'm

3299
02:48:09,261 --> 02:48:13,430
trying to make sure the wind is ride
and I'm not thinking about anything else

3300
02:48:13,431 --> 02:48:17,630
man, nothing and why draw back and
I sent her my pin and you know,

3301
02:48:17,631 --> 02:48:18,600
and I put,

3302
02:48:18,650 --> 02:48:23,420
I'm looking through the peep site and
everything's right and the housing's level

3303
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:27,410
and I've got my anchor point and I'm
pulling up my back muscles and I'm just

3304
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:31,340
concentrating on that spot.
Aim Small, Ms. Small it all.

3305
02:48:31,341 --> 02:48:32,600
The whole world goes away.

3306
02:48:32,660 --> 02:48:37,660
The world goes away and when that
Arrow finds that crease and sinks right

3307
02:48:37,821 --> 02:48:41,590
through the, and you see those
fledglings disappear and you're like, ah,

3308
02:48:41,630 --> 02:48:42,463
we fucking did.

3309
02:48:42,660 --> 02:48:45,680
Cause some people will never understand
like why would you be happy you killed

3310
02:48:45,681 --> 02:48:50,090
an animal because it's so hard to do. It's
not that you're happy, the animals die,

3311
02:48:50,091 --> 02:48:53,720
you happy you did it. It's a
relief. It's so hard to do.

3312
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:59,000
It's like people don't understand like
to maintain calmness and stillness when

3313
02:48:59,001 --> 02:49:01,340
you're drawing on an animal.
It's not like a rifle.

3314
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:03,740
I've shot things of the
rifle and it's not easy.

3315
02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:07,600
It's more hard than people think it is,
but it's way easier than using a bow.

3316
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:10,750
It's not even close because you've got
to draw it back without being spotted.

3317
02:49:10,820 --> 02:49:14,510
Yeah. Then you've got a hose steady.
The rife was how you got sticks.

3318
02:49:15,080 --> 02:49:17,600
Stick put his shoulder.
Like I said, it ain't easy,

3319
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:22,720
but you find the crosshair once
you get it set up on a pull,

3320
02:49:22,730 --> 02:49:25,310
I pulled down so they don't see me.
So right now I'm starting to shake.

3321
02:49:25,311 --> 02:49:26,600
I've been helping.
Like the one I helped,

3322
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:29,590
three minutes and 41 seconds I
had a record and eye health is,

3323
02:49:29,680 --> 02:49:31,070
but he kept stopping

3324
02:49:31,990 --> 02:49:32,823
bags.

3325
02:49:34,180 --> 02:49:38,580
No putting on like wobbly and I posted
a video after that killed like people

3326
02:49:38,581 --> 02:49:40,800
wonder why I'm so proud of my kids.
Like do you know what?

3327
02:49:40,801 --> 02:49:44,250
It's like being 235 pounds,
six three in a tree,

3328
02:49:44,430 --> 02:49:49,430
not being spotted hold and you got to
control your breathing and one role moving

3329
02:49:49,951 --> 02:49:53,460
my hand if I go to is something he seemed
my hat, mood or silhouette, he's gone.

3330
02:49:53,490 --> 02:49:56,280
It's like really like I post a
video and it looked like a picture,

3331
02:49:56,580 --> 02:49:58,110
like just me holding it
looked like a picture.

3332
02:49:58,111 --> 02:50:02,160
God never moved like I don't think anyone
would understand how hard it is to be

3333
02:50:02,161 --> 02:50:05,100
as big as I am all up in
the tree with a climber.

3334
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:08,580
I'm using the cloud so that's hard
too and get up and just sit still.

3335
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:12,780
The wind blow and everything. You can't
sway you sent. Everything has to be right.

3336
02:50:12,810 --> 02:50:13,740
It's an art to it.

3337
02:50:13,850 --> 02:50:17,210
People never know. They'll never
know. No unless they do it.

3338
02:50:17,240 --> 02:50:20,900
It's one of those things and many people
that get mad at people that do it are

3339
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:23,840
meat eaters,
which drives me crazy.

3340
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:27,160
They think there's something wrong
with killing wild animals like that.

3341
02:50:27,230 --> 02:50:30,380
That's the best way to do it
because these animals, first of all,

3342
02:50:30,381 --> 02:50:34,220
they're going to, you're going
to get organic, real wild
meat. It's better for you.

3343
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:37,040
Second of all,
like these animals lived a real life.

3344
02:50:37,250 --> 02:50:40,040
They're not like came butcher shop

3345
02:50:41,310 --> 02:50:45,720
after I got the bed, me and my dad got
and we posted a picture and a lady,

3346
02:50:45,721 --> 02:50:47,640
she's in the same stuff in
the company and I know she's,

3347
02:50:48,090 --> 02:50:49,170
I've seen her at a barbecue,

3348
02:50:49,171 --> 02:50:53,520
her and her husband like pound and
burgers and I posted the picture, shit,

3349
02:50:53,640 --> 02:50:55,920
I can't believe you.
I will no longer follow you.

3350
02:50:56,100 --> 02:50:59,630
How could you dare go in a
while and kill a bear to eat it?

3351
02:51:00,470 --> 02:51:02,290
Don't chew,
eat burgers out.

3352
02:51:02,420 --> 02:51:07,220
You went and got a on somebody took and
chained up and slaughter you rather that

3353
02:51:07,221 --> 02:51:10,550
then me going out and getting them in
most natural way ever. Not only that,

3354
02:51:10,910 --> 02:51:14,030
if you love animals, you got to kill
bears because they eat everything.

3355
02:51:14,480 --> 02:51:19,480
They eat 50% of all the
deer fawns and El Calves,

3356
02:51:20,390 --> 02:51:22,550
they get killed by bears.
50% of them.

3357
02:51:22,750 --> 02:51:25,370
Like I post a picture of killing and
coyote wants and everybody like, oh,

3358
02:51:25,390 --> 02:51:28,030
did you get to coyote? Didn't do anything
to you. But the thing they didn't see,

3359
02:51:28,031 --> 02:51:32,650
I posted a video a week later I killed
the coyote as he was chasing down a dope.

3360
02:51:33,100 --> 02:51:35,510
He was like trying to
get them and I saw it.

3361
02:51:35,511 --> 02:51:38,140
I swung good and right when he came out,
POW flipped and it was over.

3362
02:51:38,590 --> 02:51:42,280
I saved the deer's life. Boy y'all saw
was the picture of the county. What?

3363
02:51:42,281 --> 02:51:45,250
You can't eat them. Yeah, but
I saved the other wildlife.

3364
02:51:45,310 --> 02:51:46,750
It's just you never make everybody happy.

3365
02:51:46,850 --> 02:51:50,270
You can't make anybody happy that doesn't
understand hunting, that's for sure.

3366
02:51:50,271 --> 02:51:54,900
They, they have this perception of it from
movies and from a lot of those redneck

3367
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:58,310
stupid TV shows where,
you know, they just don't,

3368
02:51:58,340 --> 02:52:00,770
they don't portray
hunting in a positive way.

3369
02:52:01,190 --> 02:52:04,070
And so people get this
negative impression about it.

3370
02:52:04,071 --> 02:52:08,700
But I think with people like you, elite
athletes that are getting into a boat,

3371
02:52:08,701 --> 02:52:13,360
Jackson is a big bow hunter. You know,
there's a lot of boners now that are,

3372
02:52:13,420 --> 02:52:16,480
you know that we're just athletes
and they realize like, wow,

3373
02:52:16,481 --> 02:52:20,860
this is thrilling and exciting and
then it's the best meat in the world.

3374
02:52:20,861 --> 02:52:23,140
So you have so many
pros and it's the most,

3375
02:52:23,260 --> 02:52:26,320
I think it's the most ethical way to
eat meat because you're going out and

3376
02:52:26,321 --> 02:52:29,590
getting it yourself.
You're not hiring some supermarket hitman.

3377
02:52:29,830 --> 02:52:30,850
You're doing it yourself.

3378
02:52:31,050 --> 02:52:33,140
All right. That's the thing. Well
my youtube has the main point.

3379
02:52:33,141 --> 02:52:34,130
Ain't no ho about hunting.

3380
02:52:34,430 --> 02:52:38,340
It's more like one a black
guy on community to show him.

3381
02:52:38,341 --> 02:52:42,340
It was more than just killing. Like I so
far the one I'm at now is a Turkey hunt.

3382
02:52:42,350 --> 02:52:44,540
This whole week I'm out there
but I didn't kill anything.

3383
02:52:44,541 --> 02:52:45,400
But it's more showing you that.

3384
02:52:45,401 --> 02:52:49,260
It's more like you see the deer walk up
to view the sun coming up to sign going.

3385
02:52:49,261 --> 02:52:49,670
Right.

3386
02:52:49,670 --> 02:52:52,920
You, she said all this in editing
it. I'm doing it all myself now.

3387
02:52:52,921 --> 02:52:55,540
Do you think you'll have a career in
that after you get done with fiberglass?

3388
02:52:56,260 --> 02:52:59,710
Like I told when I meet people at the
shows that work with and work with me like

3389
02:52:59,711 --> 02:53:01,660
I don't know, what do you want? Like
I don't want no money or anything.

3390
02:53:01,690 --> 02:53:04,150
I just want to try to help.
If you can let me use one of your gear.

3391
02:53:04,180 --> 02:53:05,470
One of the thing and I advertise it,

3392
02:53:05,530 --> 02:53:09,430
I put you a little link at the beginning
tack the Cam Bolt Cream lift people I

3393
02:53:09,431 --> 02:53:13,210
use just put a thing on there cause I
don't want money but cause I'm just a

3394
02:53:13,211 --> 02:53:17,650
fight. I'm not a hunter. I love the
sport. I love hunting and you share,

3395
02:53:17,651 --> 02:53:18,850
you help advertise whatever.

3396
02:53:19,150 --> 02:53:22,750
I'm just wanting to get as well
as well known as I am in fighting.

3397
02:53:22,810 --> 02:53:25,960
I want the same thing and
hunting and without a dude's
as you bring other people,

3398
02:53:25,961 --> 02:53:28,940
cause I see like when I go to the boat
shop people were asked all the time like

3399
02:53:28,941 --> 02:53:29,890
I'm in today.

3400
02:53:29,891 --> 02:53:32,220
I was in a hotel on my been like oh
you got to get some of that a guitar.

3401
02:53:32,230 --> 02:53:35,280
Like no it's a bow and arrow. You see a
guy say, boy there he looked at it. Yeah.

3402
02:53:35,320 --> 02:53:38,170
Huh? I love hunting. Especially when
you see me. Like I told my wife,

3403
02:53:38,440 --> 02:53:41,950
I'm going to first person on Joe Rogan
shooting techno thing with Jordan's a do

3404
02:53:41,951 --> 02:53:42,620
rag.

3405
02:53:42,620 --> 02:53:45,320
What would a ball,
they don't work that way.

3406
02:53:46,490 --> 02:53:48,670
Nobody wearing [inaudible] and Jordan.

3407
02:53:48,930 --> 02:53:50,840
You see that guy on the
streets with sounds,

3408
02:53:50,841 --> 02:53:52,550
but then you see me with a boat or a gun.

3409
02:53:52,580 --> 02:53:55,100
I wonder if you're the first
guy to ever shoot tech dot.

3410
02:53:55,101 --> 02:53:59,090
Wearing a do rag and a bow.
You mark and Jordan's.

3411
02:54:00,170 --> 02:54:02,210
Someone's done that
before I went to do rec.

3412
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:06,740
You might get somebody to do at the
Joe rags. Jordan's about to do. Right?

3413
02:54:06,800 --> 02:54:09,830
It's true. I got them both. You've
got the Combo, you know what I mean?

3414
02:54:09,831 --> 02:54:12,680
So that's the, I want people to see
what the show, not about hunting, just,

3415
02:54:13,280 --> 02:54:16,910
you don't have to be the
typical what people see.

3416
02:54:16,911 --> 02:54:19,970
You see country guys,
cowboy has cowboy boots,

3417
02:54:20,420 --> 02:54:23,540
kick shit kickers and the trucks and
that's the guy you expect to be a hunter,

3418
02:54:23,690 --> 02:54:24,920
right?
You got to walk around and came up.

3419
02:54:24,921 --> 02:54:27,950
But I want somebody to see because people
find out how like you, Huh? I love it.

3420
02:54:28,070 --> 02:54:29,810
That's it. I don't know. People

3421
02:54:29,810 --> 02:54:33,710
see a top level UFC fight or doing
it and they're like, whoa. Really?

3422
02:54:33,711 --> 02:54:37,880
Like this is life. Yeah, that's, I
love that. You love it man. It's, it's,

3423
02:54:37,910 --> 02:54:39,410
it means a lot to me, man. I,

3424
02:54:39,411 --> 02:54:43,490
I think that positive role models like
you or what the sport needs to change

3425
02:54:43,491 --> 02:54:46,460
people's boom. I don't want to say sport
cause I don't think hunting is a sport,

3426
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:50,300
let's call it a disclosure. A culture
to change people's perceptions of it.

3427
02:54:50,330 --> 02:54:54,530
The positive people like you that are
elite athletes and just for people to get

3428
02:54:54,531 --> 02:54:56,480
a chance to see like, hey, this is the,

3429
02:54:56,481 --> 02:54:58,580
I mean I'm not encouraging
everyone to do it,

3430
02:54:58,581 --> 02:55:00,170
but I think there's a lot of
people that would love that.

3431
02:55:00,171 --> 02:55:04,040
I've never tried it because they may be,
don't have an an of what it actually

3432
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:08,280
is. So if they see you or they see the
videos of you doing like Chad Mendez,

3433
02:55:08,281 --> 02:55:12,410
we'll deep, he's deepened. But that's
all he does. I love it. He loves it.

3434
02:55:12,411 --> 02:55:14,130
That's all he wants to do.
I mean he,

3435
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:19,090
he basically is fighting to pay for
his hunting career, you know. Oh,

3436
02:55:19,660 --> 02:55:22,190
it, this is just scouting and stuff. Yeah.

3437
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:25,610
But like right now I've got
this in Jersey. Yeah. This
is like behind my house.

3438
02:55:26,210 --> 02:55:30,650
You got Mavens, Huh? It's all a lie.
I, I see everybody think everything.

3439
02:55:30,651 --> 02:55:32,390
I post this stuff.
I got hooked,

3440
02:55:32,391 --> 02:55:37,160
know a lot of stuff I got I purchased
because I'll have maybe even hook you up

3441
02:55:37,520 --> 02:55:40,200
Brandon Weaver way yet. I actually
met him, I met him at the great,

3442
02:55:40,480 --> 02:55:44,060
that's not Baltimore. Great. Like I try
to understand like I'm a purchase this.

3443
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:46,340
Oh that's good man. Good for
you. They make great shit.

3444
02:55:46,370 --> 02:55:48,460
I mean there's a lot of great
companies out there. The Guy Filming,

3445
02:55:48,520 --> 02:55:51,860
he was a teammate of mine. I hunts but
wanting to guy. I talked to Frankie Edgar.

3446
02:55:52,130 --> 02:55:54,550
He said he wouldn't do it. Somebody gave
him a bow. It's like, give me a ball.

3447
02:55:54,551 --> 02:55:58,310
I set it up. I show you how to get, I got
all my guys tell him I'll send the link.

3448
02:55:58,610 --> 02:55:59,443
Um,

3449
02:56:00,050 --> 02:56:03,380
do you hunter safety car and I take your
eye off film it and I'll show you how

3450
02:56:03,381 --> 02:56:07,220
to do it real. Like my buddies in Jersey,
he's a Jersey Shore Guido type guy,

3451
02:56:07,560 --> 02:56:09,830
but like I taught him how to
shoot it both 15 weeks ago.

3452
02:56:10,460 --> 02:56:14,840
Couldn't be kept mixing up the difference
between uh, is this your shop? Yeah,

3453
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:17,690
this is a little pro shop in
the basement. Oh Wow. Nice.

3454
02:56:17,720 --> 02:56:19,700
So you set up your own
bows and everything.

3455
02:56:19,940 --> 02:56:24,110
You level your third access to all this
stuff. No kidding. That's great man.

3456
02:56:24,380 --> 02:56:26,120
I love it.
So the thing is just getting people,

3457
02:56:26,121 --> 02:56:29,360
I won't average Joes you get together with
Jim Miller, he's out there too, right?

3458
02:56:29,390 --> 02:56:32,170
He's up in a summit. I haven't
hunted with him, but we talked,

3459
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:35,180
he's another one full balls deep.

3460
02:56:35,240 --> 02:56:39,020
I'm working with his guys at a and w
labs right now for like attracting and

3461
02:56:39,021 --> 02:56:43,550
whatnot. Then in Bocc creek are
the two I use NW labs and w last

3462
02:56:45,100 --> 02:56:48,680
and attract oh popcorn or whatever.
So like getting them on camera.

3463
02:56:49,010 --> 02:56:51,560
So like I use this stuff like
the killer queue. Like I said,

3464
02:56:51,561 --> 02:56:54,410
it's not just getting people in it,
but like getting these local shops.

3465
02:56:54,411 --> 02:56:57,020
Like he told him like we don't sell in
the stores. We tried to get a few here,

3466
02:56:57,021 --> 02:57:00,800
a few there, but like we don't have to
the network to get our name out there.

3467
02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:03,680
So those people like that, right.
Supporting those. I support me.

3468
02:57:03,920 --> 02:57:06,980
You helped me support me fighting
and how post your stuff, you know,

3469
02:57:06,981 --> 02:57:08,330
cause I got more followers than you.

3470
02:57:08,331 --> 02:57:10,820
So maybe somebody will click the
link for sure there and that.

3471
02:57:10,821 --> 02:57:14,630
Give it a try for sure. That's awesome
man. Do you have a perfect attitude?

3472
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:16,880
I would. I would think, you know,

3473
02:57:17,960 --> 02:57:21,470
there's a lot of careers right
now in the hunting world.

3474
02:57:21,471 --> 02:57:23,540
Like a lot of guys make videos,

3475
02:57:23,541 --> 02:57:27,860
they post videos and they basically
make a great living just making hunting

3476
02:57:27,861 --> 02:57:30,860
videos. I mean, you can, you
can do that now, honey podcast.

3477
02:57:30,861 --> 02:57:32,360
Now you know Steve Rinella,

3478
02:57:32,361 --> 02:57:35,570
who's the guy who got me into
hunting in 2012 for that show?

3479
02:57:35,571 --> 02:57:38,330
You've seen him show me. Um, they,

3480
02:57:38,360 --> 02:57:42,890
they make tremendous money now touring.
They do these podcasts,

3481
02:57:42,891 --> 02:57:46,880
these bow hunting podcasts and then
they do them live. They don't live.

3482
02:57:46,881 --> 02:57:48,770
It's sold out theaters.
I mean it's crazy.

3483
02:57:48,980 --> 02:57:51,890
I mean I tried to get them involved in
podcasting years ago because he would be

3484
02:57:51,891 --> 02:57:55,070
on mine and he was so good at it.
I'm like, you're such a great talker.

3485
02:57:55,370 --> 02:57:58,910
You'd be perfect for this. And now
it's just one of the biggest things,

3486
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:04,000
but it's one more way where guys can
make a living and also spread a really

3487
02:58:04,621 --> 02:58:09,450
positive message and be a great
ambassador for, for hunting,

3488
02:58:09,480 --> 02:58:13,060
for the hunting community. I guess
that's how posted on Frankie he did. Um,

3489
02:58:13,080 --> 02:58:14,440
the butcher box is that the new thing?

3490
02:58:15,450 --> 02:58:17,730
Not telling him like I've been trying
to tell him, go out to woods and Mac,

3491
02:58:17,731 --> 02:58:20,470
we can get you some meat. I got
hammered Ricardo meet if they want it.

3492
02:58:20,471 --> 02:58:23,760
I'm a freezer and somebody says
something about my comment. I was like,

3493
02:58:24,030 --> 02:58:27,240
I can give a man a fish and he had food
for days with, I teach a man to fish.

3494
02:58:27,240 --> 02:58:31,260
You have food for life. Like, yeah, he
can get this box right, like it'd be cool.

3495
02:58:31,410 --> 02:58:33,910
He was like, oh no, everybody got hunting
like you, but I can teach them. Yeah.

3496
02:58:33,930 --> 02:58:36,300
Anybody. That's what you can hit
me up anytime you willing to hunt.

3497
02:58:36,301 --> 02:58:38,040
If you can make it to me,
I will take you out.

3498
02:58:38,190 --> 02:58:41,440
And New Jersey is infested
with deer everywhere. Like, Oh,

3499
02:58:41,570 --> 02:58:45,750
you're a murderer prompt, but when it
hits your car, you mad. I'm saving.

3500
02:58:45,751 --> 02:58:50,310
You would have probably some guy in my
friend campaigns neighborhood last year

3501
02:58:50,311 --> 02:58:53,490
died guy in front of them hit a deer.

3502
02:58:53,580 --> 02:58:56,850
The deer went up in the air and came
through his windshield. Killed him.

3503
02:58:57,210 --> 02:58:59,040
That was a freak store.
Yeah, but if I killed him,

3504
02:58:59,041 --> 02:59:01,110
I shot the deer before he got to the
rope. Right. That wouldn't happen.

3505
02:59:01,210 --> 02:59:02,043
You saving lives.

3506
02:59:02,070 --> 02:59:05,420
I'm saving lives and getting Lyme
disease and ticks and everything.

3507
02:59:05,430 --> 02:59:08,300
I know you get on. Not yet. Oh,

3508
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:12,690
I say all the time you're like obsessed
with ticks now you should. Exactly.

3509
02:59:12,730 --> 02:59:14,890
I was like, I feel like it's ticking on
me or something and maybe I got ticks.

3510
02:59:14,910 --> 02:59:19,050
I put the soy zone. I use lethal now
putting on my skin, everything good,

3511
02:59:19,051 --> 02:59:24,051
but have you in the woods not feel
something and sure enough fucking tick on.

3512
02:59:24,480 --> 02:59:26,640
I get home,
I got socks over my pants,

3513
02:59:26,670 --> 02:59:29,910
gloves over my sleeves and everything
tucked in and I take everything off.

3514
02:59:29,911 --> 02:59:32,400
I'll look in the mirror straight up,
be one of them. My back like dead ass.

3515
02:59:32,401 --> 02:59:35,460
I was at the Philly fights and me and my
buddies from heroes sports or something

3516
02:59:35,461 --> 02:59:38,040
like real flex. I'm on my back, my
version. What are you talking about?

3517
02:59:38,080 --> 02:59:42,000
We ain't on the back and I reached in my
shirt and sure now put fucking tick on

3518
02:59:42,001 --> 02:59:45,870
my back. Like fucking are we affiliated
to fights? Wow. Fucking ticket on.

3519
02:59:45,871 --> 02:59:48,030
They're everywhere.
Everywhere. They're everywhere.

3520
02:59:48,031 --> 02:59:50,460
In some giant percentage
of them have Lyme disease.

3521
02:59:50,461 --> 02:59:55,461
They say New Jersey is a highest and
festive place or it ticks and line.

3522
02:59:55,930 --> 02:59:59,990
I mean, you see what happened with Jim
Miller, I mean up for years. Yeah. Yeah.

3523
03:00:00,050 --> 03:00:03,000
I mean fuck my friend's son up.
He got bell's Palsy.

3524
03:00:03,001 --> 03:00:07,050
Where's his face went numb on the
sun. Yeah, it's fucking bad, man.

3525
03:00:07,140 --> 03:00:09,300
I think frank was a friend, Garrick
and one of the guys, the Jim,

3526
03:00:09,301 --> 03:00:12,930
his wife had lines. It's got bit a while
ago and she was messed up for awhile.

3527
03:00:12,990 --> 03:00:13,890
Marcus Davis,

3528
03:00:13,891 --> 03:00:17,520
you know Marcus Davis wound up using
all of his money he earned in the UFC to

3529
03:00:17,521 --> 03:00:21,060
help his wife because his wife got
real bad Lyme disease where she was

3530
03:00:21,061 --> 03:00:24,630
hospitalized for a long time.
Man, people don't understand that.

3531
03:00:24,630 --> 03:00:27,660
That shit can devastate you.
That is a dirty disease.

3532
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:31,730
Those little stinking fucking text,
man, they can really mess your life.

3533
03:00:31,750 --> 03:00:34,860
I'm surprised cam don't get as much as
he carried a deer. Every time I see that,

3534
03:00:34,861 --> 03:00:37,470
and I'll be thinking of how do you
carry the deer on your neck? If he did,

3535
03:00:37,471 --> 03:00:42,280
he'd never tell anybody he would have
Lyme disease and just run 150 miles and so

3536
03:00:42,290 --> 03:00:46,020
a lot of disease dry it out.
He's a psycho II.

3537
03:00:46,380 --> 03:00:50,400
There's discipline and then this would,
that guy has, and this guy too though,

3538
03:00:50,410 --> 03:00:53,190
ya'll Goggins. He's another
one man. He's another one.

3539
03:00:53,270 --> 03:00:55,080
It's like these guys that like they,

3540
03:00:55,081 --> 03:00:59,680
they exhibit this next level toughness
to makes you reexamine what you're doing.

3541
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:01,060
Like you think you're tough.

3542
03:01:01,240 --> 03:01:04,240
And then he found out what Goggins
what we say he'd ran like 28,

3543
03:01:04,300 --> 03:01:08,380
100 fucking mile runs in a row.
Something insane like that.

3544
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:12,680
Why northern ones? A lot. Why?
Because when you run over two miles,

3545
03:01:12,681 --> 03:01:17,360
I look like why I get a text message
from Goggins say stay hard motherfucker.

3546
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:22,150
This is, I'm checking in on you right
now. You hear him yelling at a tech.

3547
03:01:22,880 --> 03:01:27,050
Have you seen the um, document,
uh, Netflix losers? No,

3548
03:01:27,051 --> 03:01:30,830
I haven't looked it up. It's one on,
uh, the guy called lost in the desert.

3549
03:01:31,070 --> 03:01:34,100
It's the guy who runs, it's a desert
ruin. They do Karen what country?

3550
03:01:34,101 --> 03:01:37,610
But you go out there and he was just so
men, so obsessed with winning, I guess.

3551
03:01:37,900 --> 03:01:39,690
Thousands thousand people
running through this desert base.

3552
03:01:39,691 --> 03:01:42,920
Of course they had to follow when the
wind get bad, they got checkins away,

3553
03:01:42,930 --> 03:01:45,380
whatnot they supposed to follow.
And this guy, he was so obsessed,

3554
03:01:45,460 --> 03:01:46,151
he wasn't checking it.

3555
03:01:46,151 --> 03:01:49,040
He was like trying to take shortcuts and
like if I go to this way, I'll find it.

3556
03:01:49,460 --> 03:01:53,060
He had to go off the course and when
to clear it up. He was way off course,

3557
03:01:53,300 --> 03:01:55,250
but he was so obsessed.
I still got to finish.

3558
03:01:55,430 --> 03:01:58,340
He was out there for like five or
something. Five or six days. Yeah,

3559
03:01:58,610 --> 03:02:01,280
and that's talking about
how they announced to his
family. He told his family,

3560
03:02:01,281 --> 03:02:03,710
your husband's dead. We
can't find you. Find them.

3561
03:02:03,711 --> 03:02:05,390
They had helicopters
going all over the place.

3562
03:02:05,630 --> 03:02:07,520
He went to a point where he's
like drinking his own pissed.

3563
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:10,340
He found this cave was full of bags
and start ripping the heads off,

3564
03:02:10,341 --> 03:02:13,750
mixing them up, drink it to survive,
drinking the bat, choose strategies,

3565
03:02:13,770 --> 03:02:16,550
mixing it up. And he like, at one point
I heard the helicopter coming over.

3566
03:02:16,880 --> 03:02:18,590
He took all his clothes,
all his gear,

3567
03:02:18,620 --> 03:02:22,190
dug a hole and set it on fire hoping
they would see him at the fire one up.

3568
03:02:22,190 --> 03:02:25,610
The wind blew it out so he didn't get
sick. So he out there with no gear,

3569
03:02:25,611 --> 03:02:29,030
no nothing in the middle of nowhere.
He's a vile. He ended up getting back.

3570
03:02:29,480 --> 03:02:32,060
His mind was like, I have to
finish. He's a, everybody left.

3571
03:02:32,061 --> 03:02:33,590
He said when he got there to check.
Point was gone,

3572
03:02:33,591 --> 03:02:37,160
but his friend had flew back to find them
and sure enough he from his friend was

3573
03:02:37,161 --> 03:02:38,390
there,
found them in a desert.

3574
03:02:39,430 --> 03:02:42,290
It's called the document's
called losers here.

3575
03:02:42,710 --> 03:02:46,250
Losers in the episode is lost in the desk.
The whole show is good.

3576
03:02:46,550 --> 03:02:49,330
All the little things on it was good,
but that lost in the desert one.

3577
03:02:49,550 --> 03:02:50,720
He ended up divorcing.

3578
03:02:50,721 --> 03:02:54,710
His wife was his wife left him
because after that he still went back.

3579
03:02:55,250 --> 03:02:57,980
He came home and she was like, you're not
going back to like I'm doing it again.

3580
03:02:58,040 --> 03:03:01,460
I have to finish and now he still does it.
He divorced his wife.

3581
03:03:01,700 --> 03:03:04,610
His wife left him when his wife left
him because you've got a family.

3582
03:03:04,700 --> 03:03:06,920
When she left, when he left, she was
mad like, what about your family?

3583
03:03:06,950 --> 03:03:09,650
People die on this. What? It happened. He
was like, don't worry. This isn't this.

3584
03:03:09,680 --> 03:03:12,260
I love this. I have to do it. When
he came back and his wife was like,

3585
03:03:12,261 --> 03:03:15,500
we're not doing it again. He was like,
yes, I am like, you just don't like,

3586
03:03:15,501 --> 03:03:17,510
he was pretty much dead.
They put him in the hospital.

3587
03:03:17,511 --> 03:03:21,830
They found them and everything. He ended
up doing it again. Mauro prosperity.

3588
03:03:23,120 --> 03:03:23,670
Wow.

3589
03:03:23,670 --> 03:03:28,650
The survival story of moral Prospera
disoriented after a sands torn so hard

3590
03:03:28,651 --> 03:03:29,431
desert does.

3591
03:03:29,431 --> 03:03:33,990
Italian ultra marathon runner
walked nearly 200 miles to safety.

3592
03:03:34,340 --> 03:03:39,050
Uh, but he's Italian. He's probably
going to get divorced to anyone.

3593
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:44,990
Hey, what? I know those fucking guys
are animals. You know, you see it.

3594
03:03:44,991 --> 03:03:46,520
You're going to be like,
I have to.

3595
03:03:46,521 --> 03:03:51,420
I want you to direct DME after you watched
and I will see it when he ate the bad

3596
03:03:51,421 --> 03:03:53,840
Jews. I like that. I was just
killing myself there. I'm not,

3597
03:03:54,220 --> 03:03:57,620
was really biting their heads off.
Just any Cape Dark. No, but he could.

3598
03:03:57,800 --> 03:03:59,420
He was feeling for him.
He can see the eyes he grabbed.

3599
03:04:01,610 --> 03:04:05,930
That's how you would survive a k.
What kind of diarrhea? That guy have

3600
03:04:08,040 --> 03:04:11,420
even killed it. He tried to kill this
stuff actually, but he was so dehydrated.

3601
03:04:11,421 --> 03:04:13,510
He cut his wrist because they
had the last surfing here.

3602
03:04:13,520 --> 03:04:15,860
He cut his wrists with and went
to bed hoping he's going to wait,

3603
03:04:15,890 --> 03:04:19,160
like not wake up and you woke up. He,
he's like, what in the world? He said,

3604
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:20,780
that was my sign that I
wasn't supposed to die.

3605
03:04:21,050 --> 03:04:25,780
He said when he got [inaudible] they said
you were to die dehydrated, complete.

3606
03:04:25,820 --> 03:04:28,730
So he didn't have anything. He
couldn't believe he's healed. He's,

3607
03:04:29,250 --> 03:04:31,790
he said that was it and he was pointing.
I felt myself faint.

3608
03:04:31,850 --> 03:04:33,950
I just kept telling myself,
I'm here. I have to make it.

3609
03:04:34,100 --> 03:04:35,570
I have to make it and have to make it.

3610
03:04:35,690 --> 03:04:38,860
And he said he find like he see like
some girl walking out in the desert.

3611
03:04:38,930 --> 03:04:42,340
He's like walking away. She was
going then the army, whatever arm,

3612
03:04:42,350 --> 03:04:43,070
wherever they was at,

3613
03:04:43,070 --> 03:04:46,280
the army had to come get them and they
got guns and she thinks he's going to die.

3614
03:04:46,410 --> 03:04:47,690
They ended up taking him to the house.
When he woke up,

3615
03:04:47,691 --> 03:04:50,480
he had ivs and everything and they
recovered. It took him back to his family.

3616
03:04:51,170 --> 03:04:53,330
It's a crazy story.
Like all of them was good,

3617
03:04:53,331 --> 03:04:55,850
but that was my brother calling me like,
wash that Bro.

3618
03:04:56,200 --> 03:04:59,600
You got a mentality like that.
You are fucking man washed

3619
03:04:59,690 --> 03:05:01,090
that two days any,

3620
03:05:01,091 --> 03:05:06,091
he stumbled into an abandoned Muslim
shrine where he noticed some bats huddled

3621
03:05:06,201 --> 03:05:09,080
together. Prosperity,
grabbed a handful of them,

3622
03:05:09,081 --> 03:05:12,530
cut off their heads with a knife and
then sucked out their insides to drink

3623
03:05:12,531 --> 03:05:13,970
their blood and quenches thirst.

3624
03:05:14,270 --> 03:05:19,040
Eventually he did his Vampire Act on 20
bats when another three days pass with

3625
03:05:19,041 --> 03:05:22,280
no signs of rescue.
He slit his wrists and waited to die,

3626
03:05:22,281 --> 03:05:26,180
but his blood and thickened due to
dehydration so it wouldn't drain out.

3627
03:05:27,020 --> 03:05:28,370
Fuck man.

3628
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:29,640
Like that.

3629
03:05:29,640 --> 03:05:33,160
Some goggles and candidate to get together
and do a podcast and talking about

3630
03:05:33,161 --> 03:05:35,160
that like that was,
they wouldn't

3631
03:05:35,240 --> 03:05:38,070
cut the wrist.
They

3632
03:05:40,250 --> 03:05:44,060
killed themselves. They would have
just kept going. I think that those,

3633
03:05:44,061 --> 03:05:46,640
those kinds of people is ultra
marathon people. It's a different,

3634
03:05:46,670 --> 03:05:51,530
there's different breed of human, you
know, they, it's like everything has,

3635
03:05:51,920 --> 03:05:55,640
there's levels right to everything.
There's levels you, you've,

3636
03:05:55,641 --> 03:05:58,300
you've experienced it in your
own life where you tough it up,

3637
03:05:58,310 --> 03:06:02,030
you became a stronger person, a harder
person. And then there's levels past that.

3638
03:06:02,031 --> 03:06:02,990
And then there's levels past that.

3639
03:06:02,991 --> 03:06:05,660
And especially for people
that have one solitary thing,

3640
03:06:05,661 --> 03:06:10,250
they do like ultra marathons, they're
all skinny dudes who can just keep going,

3641
03:06:10,720 --> 03:06:15,620
just keep going. It's just, it's,
it's the, the pulling it off the,

3642
03:06:15,621 --> 03:06:19,670
crossing the line and knowing that
you did something that seemed almost

3643
03:06:19,671 --> 03:06:22,790
impossible. So, so titanic, Lee,

3644
03:06:23,390 --> 03:06:27,880
epically difficult to do that. So few
people can ever do it. When they do,

3645
03:06:27,930 --> 03:06:31,910
they're talking about running a 500 mile
race now because they did the Moab to

3646
03:06:31,911 --> 03:06:34,570
30 and they had the big foot 200 they'll,

3647
03:06:34,590 --> 03:06:36,650
all these people that are putting
on these races, they be like, okay,

3648
03:06:36,651 --> 03:06:40,910
we could do to 40 let's see if we could
do 500 so now talking about doing a 500

3649
03:06:40,911 --> 03:06:44,450
mile race,
it's next level.

3650
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:48,190
It's hard for me to run a five K I
hearing what? You're a big fellow too.

3651
03:06:48,250 --> 03:06:49,090
I mean I could do it,

3652
03:06:49,091 --> 03:06:52,600
but I did in college and I've never been
like a nothing calculated like you had

3653
03:06:52,601 --> 03:06:55,830
to pay do again. It was like a charity
we have to do for college. Nope.

3654
03:06:55,920 --> 03:06:58,020
Never again. Have you ever thought
about doing something like that?

3655
03:06:58,021 --> 03:07:00,630
Like I'm going to go around and
around five K I ain't Finna pay.

3656
03:07:02,690 --> 03:07:03,660
It's like going Scott, I, well,

3657
03:07:03,661 --> 03:07:07,800
I'm going to jump out of perfectly good
plane to go into ground pay to run a

3658
03:07:07,801 --> 03:07:10,340
five k like what are they?
Is it organizing it again?

3659
03:07:10,810 --> 03:07:12,960
Most of them I go to
foundations and stuff like that,

3660
03:07:13,290 --> 03:07:15,930
but even then like you heard about
the foundation that take money.

3661
03:07:16,110 --> 03:07:19,290
I don't trust do you do here, but I
was like, I'm not paying no punting.

3662
03:07:19,330 --> 03:07:23,220
Some books to go run 13.1
miles. Right. Cool people.

3663
03:07:23,860 --> 03:07:27,030
It's more the fact that I can say I
did it. I can say I did it on my own.

3664
03:07:27,540 --> 03:07:32,200
I run 13.1 miles, my phone,
13 miles. We're good.

3665
03:07:33,710 --> 03:07:35,790
Tracked my mind, track my ruin. Boom.

3666
03:07:35,791 --> 03:07:38,430
Tell me how far I go and hit
13 I'm done calling a taxi.

3667
03:07:39,430 --> 03:07:42,600
But you like when you're a big
guy like you, you probably,

3668
03:07:42,690 --> 03:07:46,020
it's probably not good to run a lot of
miles. Right. And a lot of pounding,

3669
03:07:46,070 --> 03:07:48,360
especially on flat foot shit.
I'm so flat.

3670
03:07:48,361 --> 03:07:51,700
Like my ankle was like touching the
inside of the ankle says I'm so flat foot

3671
03:07:51,750 --> 03:07:54,750
and then five plus zero zero arch at all.

3672
03:07:55,050 --> 03:07:58,720
It's like I get a new pair of shoes every
can't we have to campus over cause by

3673
03:07:58,721 --> 03:08:00,810
all the movement at random dude,
I use the same shoes.

3674
03:08:01,320 --> 03:08:03,990
Athletic shoes for hitting Mitts
and shadow boxing and running.

3675
03:08:04,290 --> 03:08:06,840
So we're all at a flat foot
is pushing down, pushing down.

3676
03:08:06,870 --> 03:08:08,700
My time is time to fight.
It's going like,

3677
03:08:08,701 --> 03:08:11,940
I feel that my feet are hurting and my
cats hurt. I know it's time for new shoes.

3678
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:17,040
Minimalist shoes like those toe
shoes or a minimalist shoes.

3679
03:08:17,330 --> 03:08:22,080
They make them in my size. What size? 14
I bet they do. I guarantee you they do.

3680
03:08:22,200 --> 03:08:24,690
They make them in 11 I'm 11 now.
Yeah. That's the big difference.

3681
03:08:24,691 --> 03:08:29,691
They make everything in 11 and
13 I had to sweating 14 yes,

3682
03:08:30,580 --> 03:08:33,330
roommates and I was big.

3683
03:08:33,331 --> 03:08:35,880
I was six foot tall or
freshman year in high school.

3684
03:08:35,881 --> 03:08:38,300
At 13 years old I was six foot. Wow. Yeah.

3685
03:08:41,450 --> 03:08:43,470
I like that. Was a heavyweight
from freshman year high school.

3686
03:08:43,471 --> 03:08:44,260
A senior in college.

3687
03:08:44,260 --> 03:08:48,590
That's two 15 to 85 what motive
you to go down to motivated?

3688
03:08:48,600 --> 03:08:50,510
You go down to two oh five well I went,

3689
03:08:50,550 --> 03:08:54,060
I did a catch weight fight at like two
20 the fight before I went to ultimate

3690
03:08:54,061 --> 03:08:57,270
fighter. When I went there I had to
go to a five of course as you made it,

3691
03:08:57,271 --> 03:08:59,340
you wanted to build here.
You might as well try it,

3692
03:08:59,370 --> 03:09:02,940
go to a five like you can do it. I know
you can do it. Once I got, it's like,

3693
03:09:02,941 --> 03:09:06,630
all right, I can do this. There was
like 85 like I can't, I'm not doing it.

3694
03:09:06,631 --> 03:09:09,540
I could do it but I'm not doing it.
I remember what it took to get here.

3695
03:09:09,750 --> 03:09:12,330
It Ain't worth, it's not worth
it. It's you're, you're too big.

3696
03:09:12,830 --> 03:09:16,220
If you look at you like I think a
lot of guys have fucked a career.

3697
03:09:16,221 --> 03:09:18,750
So by doing that,
dropping too much weight,

3698
03:09:18,790 --> 03:09:22,860
you guys think you really get rocked off
a punch, then you're very dehydrated.

3699
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:24,300
That one little touch,
like I said,

3700
03:09:24,301 --> 03:09:26,670
I think that was a part of the reason
why I got knocked out against Jimmy.

3701
03:09:26,671 --> 03:09:27,900
So I was so light.

3702
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:31,920
I weighed in at two oh five and next day
I weighed in at two 12 going into the

3703
03:09:31,921 --> 03:09:35,430
green. He was two 29 checking in
and he weighed in at two 27 before,

3704
03:09:35,470 --> 03:09:39,540
during and he said like you choose small
and I feel like my mind, like I said,

3705
03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:41,790
I used to keep myself so low.

3706
03:09:42,180 --> 03:09:44,460
Like when I wake up and when I get
up so fast so have to sit back down.

3707
03:09:44,710 --> 03:09:47,070
Like I could tell I was getting
lightheaded so easy you I what?

3708
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:47,880
I was doing too much.

3709
03:09:47,880 --> 03:09:50,030
I didn't get lightheaded and I
have to sit there for awhile.

3710
03:09:50,100 --> 03:09:51,630
Let's drink some water and stand up slow.

3711
03:09:51,820 --> 03:09:54,070
That's the feeling you get when
you couldn't. That's so crazy.

3712
03:09:54,100 --> 03:09:55,870
But I was feeling that all the time.

3713
03:09:56,110 --> 03:09:58,380
Do something too fast and training and
it had to sit down in a matter about,

3714
03:09:58,500 --> 03:10:01,860
yeah, give me a second and I'll
stand up. I got terrible. Yeah.

3715
03:10:01,870 --> 03:10:04,410
But in my mind is like, if I stay here,
I'm always ready for a fight. Okay.

3716
03:10:04,420 --> 03:10:05,110
It wasn't good

3717
03:10:05,110 --> 03:10:09,940
at all. No, no. You cutting back on your
performance in a big way, but listen,

3718
03:10:09,941 --> 03:10:14,050
man, now we did a half hour
more, so that's good. Let's
get the fuck out of here.

3719
03:10:14,110 --> 03:10:17,530
And uh, it's good to go on a hunt,
man. Let's you and me doing it. Okay.

3720
03:10:17,531 --> 03:10:20,530
We'll figure something out. This,
I'm, I'm all booked up for this fall,

3721
03:10:20,531 --> 03:10:24,250
but maybe next year we'll start planning.
Right. I'd like to take you out to Utah.

3722
03:10:24,360 --> 03:10:27,250
I was, especially after this year's elk
hunt and I'm, you're going to love it.

3723
03:10:27,420 --> 03:10:31,030
All right. Do it Corey Anderson.
Thanks sir. Bye everybody.

3724
03:10:32,990 --> 03:10:33,823
That was great.

3725
03:10:41,260 --> 03:10:42,093
Okay.

3726
03:10:46,620 --> 03:10:46,710
Okay.
