1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,600
Pi,
Tony and cliff.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,470
Hello.
I'm smelling this weed in 12 hours.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,840
I'll be free.
I'm excited for you.

4
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:12,210
Did.
I didn't do shit for sober October.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,450
You stay drunk.
I didn't stay drunk.

6
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,090
I just had a drink or two pretty much 
every night.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,790
Would you ever consider doing something 
like sober October?

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,200
I mean like if,
you know,

9
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:23,034
if I was a part of it and like I got all
that promotional push that everybody's 

10
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,490
giving themselves.
Hell yeah.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,280
For the business point,
for this.

12
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,410
The only reason why you do it.
That's the only reason I would do it.

13
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:33,000
I have no reason I'm in.
I'm in,

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,880
you know,
I'm in perfect shape.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,890
Feel good about life.
Every day is good.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,240
You know,
I,

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,073
I've been cutting back on things 
naturally like I'm done with my college 

18
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,200
years of,
you know,

19
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,010
getting wasted at the store and things 
like that.

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,470
It's like when you were also not smoking
cigarettes anymore.

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,730
Right?
I'm off cigarettes,

22
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,770
which helps a lot by the way.
You know,

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,620
I got to say for anybody out there that 
drinks and smokes,

24
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:58,380
the two correlate,
you quit one.

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,050
It's gonna help with the other big tie 
split.

26
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:00,884
I mean I'm just saying like cutting back
on smoking because the two go so good 

27
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:05,330
together.
Yeah.

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,970
You were finding that those pens weren't
really helping you that much?

29
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,560
Huh?
The nicotine pendants.

30
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,161
Oh yeah.
No,

31
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:12,000
I love them.
Yeah.

32
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,970
They're there to help you quit.
You were still,

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,490
you were saying that it's not the same.
It's not the same.

34
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,503
I mean when you're a,
when you love cigarettes and both of my 

35
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:21,144
parents smoked.
My mom quit when she got pregnant with 

36
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:24,474
me and then started again like a year 
later and she would smoke like in the 

37
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,800
little,
you know,

38
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:32,250
the little house that I grew up in and 
it was just always like,

39
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,130
my whole life was,
I was built to be a cigarette smoker.

40
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,220
Those two were probably smoking ciggies 
while banging,

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,810
making me like,
it was like,

42
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,703
I just love cigarettes.
I even still love the nice gust of 

43
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,350
secondhand smoke and now that I'm a 
nonsmoker,

44
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:49,110
it blows my mind.
Hearing people those years say,

45
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,430
oh,
cigarettes stank.

46
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:50,821
Like,
it's like,

47
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:53,470
I fucking love it.
Oh,

48
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,490
I just love it.
It just makes me feel good.

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,280
It's a weird and I know because it's 
pure poison,

50
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,740
it just goes to show like what a dark 
Lord I am.

51
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,650
Is that you or is that just cigarettes 
in general?

52
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,484
Have a grip on people to dark grip.
It really is so crazy because what else 

53
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,860
gives you nothing and takes everything 
and still it's just.

54
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:17,790
This is my favorite part of the day.
Favorite part of the night after sex.

55
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,640
During coffee,
they said that Johnny Carson,

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,920
when he was on his deathbed was just 
rotting out from the inside.

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
He was just falling apart and he was 
like those goddamn cigarette.

58
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,010
Yeah.
It's one of the main reasons why a,

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,520
I actually quit was reading about Johnny
and yeah,

60
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,800
because it's sort of correlated.
I still,

61
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,683
you know,
go on runs every day pretty much every 

62
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,294
day,
short jogs and this and that to wake up 

63
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,530
and get the day started and there was 
awhile there where I was,

64
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,920
had a lot of like confidence,
like coming up.

65
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:47,754
Not really coughing up shit,
but it was sorta just like it was there 

66
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,023
and I'd have to clear my throat before 
going on stage and it started to get 

67
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,840
like,
it wasn't onstage,

68
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,470
but it started to creep up during work 
hours.

69
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:00,260
Like it's like,
well,

70
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,103
like Joey Diaz just murked a room and 
I'm next and he's break you guys ready 

71
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:05,860
for your next to me.
I'm like,

72
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,620
oh,
I gotta get my shit together.

73
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,000
Cough up anything black.
No,

74
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,883
I've,
I've talked to people that have hocked 

75
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:18,740
up shit and it was black and they spit 
it on the ground and they saw a black,

76
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,470
like a black luggy yeah.
I was like,

77
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,800
why did you quit immediately?
Like,

78
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:25,880
no,
six more years.

79
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,383
Yeah.
But I read about Johnny and he was 

80
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:30,240
talking about like,
not only was that a major thing,

81
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:31,970
like those damn cigarettes,
like that's,

82
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,620
he just kept repeating that on his 
deathbed,

83
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,860
but they also talk about like how he was
like swimming,

84
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:40,770
which he loved to do and he just 
couldn't do it anymore.

85
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:43,290
So it was like almost drowning all the 
time and stuff.

86
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,660
Like it was just like he was out,
he was gone.

87
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:46,680
He just couldn't breathe.

88
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,120
That guy went through a rough patch.
Like not just that.

89
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,973
Do you ever read the divorce settlements
that Johnny Carson had to go through 

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,113
now?
He was one of the most famous like 

91
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,260
divorce rapings where you just go,
oh my God.

92
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,450
Like you find out how much he had to pay
his ex wife.

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:03,901
Like,
oh,

94
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:05,400
Jesus.
No,

95
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,240
he,
he,

96
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,270
he got taken.

97
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,050
Oh Man.

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,113
Murphy had a bit about it.
Eddie Murphy had a bit about Johnny 

99
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,733
Carson's divorce in his act.
I think it was in Ra did it on one of 

100
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,330
his specials?
Yes.

101
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,373
Wow.
It was that bad gi on the national 

102
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:23,514
enquirer,
but it says 220 grand a month was not 

103
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:26,980
enough.
Wow.

104
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:31,981
Carson's wife rejects settlement and 
asks $220,000

105
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,650
a month and living expenses.
17 million is not enough.

106
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,670
She said that's still.
What year does that say at the top left?

107
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,410
80.
80 three or [inaudible] 93.

108
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,240
What did she look like?
She looks Kinda hot.

109
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,110
They're not like that dirty 40 that 
dirty 40 year old.

110
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:48,460
Look,
I like that.

111
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,730
Good.
Back then.

112
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:54,640
That's like a million a month closing on
her.

113
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,250
That was the one he split up with.
He.

114
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,480
He gives up fast life and is secretly 
seeing wife again.

115
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,550
Oh,
well that's the inquirer.

116
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,560
You know what I mean?
That's what I was getting.

117
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,970
So that's,
that's the Gal who was married to that.

118
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:11,320
He had to give up 17 million bucks.
Oh.

119
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:13,770
So he's married to her for a long time.
Well,

120
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,510
how many times did he get married?
That seems like the same gal there.

121
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,753
World's most expensive.
World's most expensive divorce 

122
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:23,560
settlements.
Johnny Carson and Joanna Holland.

123
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,100
20 million.
That ain't shit now.

124
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,963
We were going over some last night or 
yesterday on the podcast a Steve Wynn 

125
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,490
gave up a billion.

126
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,490
Oh.
Oh.

127
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,300
What could she have possibly have done 
to earn that?

128
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,990
Nothing.
There's nothing she could have done.

129
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,913
She had the Voodoo postseason unless she
had all the ideas and he's just not 

130
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,940
admitting it unless she started casino 
casino.

131
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,000
You should have craft crafts

132
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,010
table even then.
Even then,

133
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,490
how much is a consultation fee worth?
A billion.

134
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,300
Oh wait.
Yeah.

135
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,610
Well,
that miss sort of looked at him,

136
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,930
by the way.
He looks like he's wearing a mask.

137
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,550
He looks like it's 24 slash seven.
Yeah.

138
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,950
Third divorce.
Unlikely for Steve Wynn.

139
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,390
Wow.
Poor guy.

140
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,390
Good Lord.
You think guys just keep going in.

141
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,830
That's what's crazy.
They're like,

142
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:25,280
no,
no.

143
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,830
She's the one.
Oh No,

144
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:27,800
no.
It's never going to change.

145
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,270
Yeah,
he's got it all figured out.

146
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:29,781
No,
no,

147
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,150
she's the one.
Oh yeah.

148
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,790
It's a strange thing.
You know,

149
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,570
it becomes,
it comes humorous like Elizabeth Taylor,

150
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,720
who was stunningly beautiful when she 
was young.

151
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,230
Did you ever see who's afraid of 
Virginia Wolf [inaudible]?

152
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,710
It's a must.
See,

153
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,480
it's a great,
great old movie.

154
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,643
But uh,
Elizabeth Taylor was probably in her 

155
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,930
twenties I guess when she did that and 
she was just so beautiful.

156
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,210
But as she got older,
like shoes,

157
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,260
see if he could see that.
That's a pretty good picture of her.

158
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:02,360
But if you see like her whole body and 
everything,

159
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:06,860
I mean she was just a bombshell and she 
was a bombshell and you know,

160
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,870
what was it?
The fifties or something like that.

161
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:09,704
Like that picture of her black and white
on the second level where you see your 

162
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,330
body.
Yeah.

163
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,470
That's a real body to dude.
Ain't no gym time there.

164
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,870
That's just straight up genetics and 
whiskey.

165
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,210
Look at them going on legs and 10 high.
That's just just as biology.

166
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,343
But then towards the end,
I mean she had been married and 

167
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:34,640
divorced.
Don't show the old pictures.

168
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:37,400
Don't show the old pictures.
You stop at Jamie.

169
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,610
Google.
Uh,

170
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,340
Elizabeth Taylor.
Amount of times married because uh,

171
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,630
I believe she was married.
Uh,

172
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,360
yeah I want to say like seven or eight 
times.

173
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,370
No fewer than eight times.
Yeah.

174
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,360
Married a couple of guys twice.
Eight marriage is only seven husbands.

175
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:02,840
She married Richard Burton twice.
She married a bunch of gay guys too.

176
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,450
Huh?
Allegedly gay guys.

177
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,630
Her first marriage.
One of the heirs of the hotelier.

178
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,700
That's a weird word.
Hotelier.

179
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,110
Hotel.
Hotel.

180
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:12,944
He airs.
Said Conrad Hilton and didn't divorce 

181
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,670
after less than a year.
Yeah.

182
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:18,950
She was a wild woman.
Wild.

183
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,470
She got paid for all this.
That's it's own business,

184
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:22,850
right?
With rich as fuck.

185
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,220
You know,
she was really successful as an actress.

186
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,760
So she probably had the money and a lot 
of them because she was dating some guys

187
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,980
that looked suspiciously homosexual,
you know,

188
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,800
like liberace,
homosexual,

189
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,540
like wait what?
Like,

190
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,153
yeah,
hit a million dollars to play Cleopatra 

191
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:41,220
in 1963.
Yeah.

192
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,283
A million bucks in 1963.
He's probably like 20 million bucks a 

193
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,030
day.
What does it mean?

194
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,073
Google that.
What is a million dollars in 1963 worth 

195
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,260
today?
That's crazy.

196
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:55,610
They paid her that much money.
Damn.

197
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,190
Who?

198
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,023
Whoever her agent is,
dig that motherfucker up this dollar 

199
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,570
times.com
says it's worth a point.

200
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,160
One billion eight.
Yeah,

201
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,510
that's it.
So yeah.

202
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,493
Wow.
I thought it wouldn't be like 20 annual 

203
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,850
inflation over this period was three 
point eight.

204
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,820
Eight percent.
That's um,

205
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:16,720
and when you think of like,
like who's the top paid female today?

206
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:18,060
Is it Jennifer Lawrence?
Maybe?

207
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:18,894
Probably.
Yeah.

208
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,970
Yeah.
What does she get?

209
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,200
She probably gets like 20,
right?

210
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:23,890
Somewhere in that 15 to 20 range 
probably.

211
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:24,724
Yeah.
So she shits on Elizabeth Taylor 

212
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,660
[inaudible] fucking hunger games pitch.
Yeah,

213
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,990
yeah.
Yeah.

214
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,040
But anyway,
um,

215
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,993
she married a bunch of gay guys I think.
See if you find out Elizabeth Taylor 

216
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,910
married gay guys,
because that was like always the standup

217
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,900
comedy joke that,
uh,

218
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,063
when I was first starting out,
I remember a bunch of guys had jokes 

219
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:47,850
about Elizabeth Taylor and merge chick 
had a joke about it too.

220
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,700
But Elizabeth Taylor always married gay 
guys,

221
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,420
like not knowing like she's so old and 
fucked up on pills.

222
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:55,930
She doesn't know the guy she's married 
or gay.

223
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,880
That's crazy.
I wonder why she would do that.

224
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,850
That was probably one companionship.
You know,

225
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,590
she was,
I think in the end there was a rumors of

226
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,110
substance abuse.
I mean,

227
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,730
I,
I'm,

228
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,950
I'm prolife perilla proliferate per 
peripherally,

229
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,750
peripherally associated with these new 
stores.

230
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,320
I don't really know him that well.
You know,

231
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,580
I just remember reading something about 
substance abuse and drinking and yeah.

232
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,280
Then there's always rough man ends rough
for a lot of people,

233
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,091
bro.
Yeah.

234
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,130
There's those pain pills and everything.
Kitchen.

235
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,523
The roughest of the rough man.
People who go out with those pain pill 

236
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:37,974
addictions we think about.
We were talking about a Joey Diaz and I 

237
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,680
were talking yesterday about Prince.
Um,

238
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,291
you know,
he was,

239
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,124
uh,
he called me up and he was singing to 

240
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:48,060
me.
He was singing that song.

241
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Do you bought him a do he won't be Jew.
He's like Purple Brain Cock sucker.

242
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,403
Joe Rogan.
What was the last time you listened to 

243
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:58,420
purple rain?
He goes,

244
00:10:58,421 --> 00:11:01,210
I'm stone as a motherfucker right now 
listening to purple rain.

245
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,133
God Damn prints was good.
And I was thinking about it like prince 

246
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:08,890
was just one of the many greats that we 
lost a pain pills just real recently.

247
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,950
Tom Petit Prince.
Who else?

248
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,480
We will last several,
several big name,

249
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,730
powerful celebrities to pain pills.
Michael Jackson now he was propafol.

250
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,040
He was um,
he was in pain pills.

251
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,860
He was that shit that they use to put 
people under.

252
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,590
Yeah.
But he was in like a lot of pain,

253
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,120
right?
Wasn't that one of his things?

254
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,153
I think so.
I think he was just so fucked up in the 

255
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:37,560
head.
So he had so much anxiety and he,

256
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,400
uh,
he just,

257
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,980
he couldn't sleep.
It was just a mess,

258
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:41,814
man.
Huh?

259
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,610
What those rumors have that he was 
addicted to pain pills.

260
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,833
Michael Jackson.
Yeah.

261
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,050
Shit did.
Yeah,

262
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,530
and he was,
he was working to make that big comeback

263
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:52,364
thing at the time too.
So they had him out there dancing and 

264
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,050
shit.
Looking like a bag of bones.

265
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,360
Yeah,

266
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,193
pretty sure.
They said that the pro pro pro fall is 

267
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,970
what killed him because he couldn't 
sleep also.

268
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,740
Yeah.
You need to sleep.

269
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,843
And what that,
what he was doing is just getting 

270
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:05,884
sedated every night.
I mean that's the reason why as Dr went 

271
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,250
to jail.
He called it milk,

272
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,590
right?
Playing smaller than milk.

273
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,460
Oh God.
Can I have,

274
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,010
I'm having a little trouble keeping the.
Oh,

275
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,300
it sparked from that accident he got in 
when he got on fire.

276
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,380
Oh,
that's right.

277
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:22,810
He caught his hair on fire for the pain 
from that.

278
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,250
Yeah.
Well that's,

279
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,680
that's what happened to this guy that I 
know.

280
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,703
He,
he hurt himself doing construction and 

281
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:31,690
then gone on some pills,
you know,

282
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:35,800
because he had a back injury and they 
put them on pills and then life is over.

283
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,053
It takes us one accident.
I've only taken a half of one pain pill 

284
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:40,654
one time and I know the exact day that 
it happened because it was the day that 

285
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:49,711
the wwe network came out.
I had my wisdom teeth pulled and they're

286
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:51,250
like,
take,

287
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,020
take all of these that you want.
I'm like,

288
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:53,920
ah,
I don't really,

289
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,400
uh,
you know,

290
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,070
I'm very reactive to pills,
blah,

291
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:56,311
blah,
blah,

292
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:57,240
blah.
But I saw,

293
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,750
but I was in a lot of pain,
so I'm like,

294
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,240
fuck it.
I'll take a half of one and man,

295
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:04,360
if I didn't go through that whole 
network's library that day,

296
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:07,600
just with a smile on my face and 
drooling on myself,

297
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,434
loving life,
just watching all the old stuff that I 

298
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,820
watched as a kid.
Wow.

299
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,650
So fun.
Let's see.

300
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,450
It was the day the network came out.

301
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,130
It would be nice if pain pills didn't do
anything bad to you.

302
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,870
They just fucked you up.
But no physical harm,

303
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,050
no addiction.
That would be part.

304
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,330
No addiction,
no physical harm.

305
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:28,790
I mean,
people are always going to be.

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,560
People are addicted to washing their 
hands.

307
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:31,394
I mean,
people are addicted to really weird 

308
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,864
shit,
but there's always going to be people 

309
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:37,250
that are addicted to things in that they
can't quit doing them,

310
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,820
but addiction,
like in your bones,

311
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,040
those pain pills.

312
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,000
So they,
they feel.

313
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,120
It felt so good.
I remember the feeling of just like,

314
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,043
oh,
this is the greatest feeling that I 

315
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,720
could do this all the time.
This is incredible.

316
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,840
It's just such a,
it's in comparable to even like,

317
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,600
you know,
drink or pot or anything like that.

318
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:02,560
It's just sit there and smile.
Just waves of heat

319
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,120
real sick once and I got ahold of that 
real nyquil in the nineties was the last

320
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:10,370
time I took it.
The real Nyquil,

321
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,930
that stuff.
I guess it was coding.

322
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,380
Was it coding that was in there?
Yeah,

323
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,270
something like that.
Right.

324
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,880
It's the CICERO.
It was wonderful.

325
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,800
It was wonderful.
I was just,

326
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,693
I was just the my pillow and my blanket 
would just cuddling me with love and I 

327
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:26,900
was just lying in bed with a stupid 
smile on my face watching TV,

328
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:28,400
just like,
uh,

329
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm so happy.
Yeah.

330
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,500
They don't make that Nyquil like they 
used to.

331
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,853
You got to get it from a doctor.
Shady dot ephedrine is what it was 

332
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:37,790
called.
That's what it is.

333
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,040
Yeah.
Nasal congestion,

334
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,660
I think.
I mean says what was taken out of it.

335
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,500
So why don't I think it is it.
Light coating is a coating.

336
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,660
We've done this before,
right?

337
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,810
We talked about this before.
I saw there's a thc liquid,

338
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:53,300
something other being sold in 1200 
milligram,

339
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,170
but it's sold in like a bottle that 
looks just like the.

340
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,803
Somebody tried to visit or something.
Somebody tried to give me some 

341
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,410
marijuana.
Beer.

342
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,770
Yeah.
THC infused beer.

343
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,600
Like you get that shit the fuck away 
from me.

344
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,780
They're making cbd infused beer soon.
Like I think budweiser,

345
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,643
coors or budweiser.
Someone invested a Shitload of money 

346
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:14,510
into in Canada or mgd.
Wow.

347
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,610
Wow.
That's interesting.

348
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,013
Well,
it would counteract the effects of 

349
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:22,520
alcohol and somewhat because one of the 
things about alcohol right,

350
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,354
is that it causes inflammation.
CBD perhaps could counteract the 

351
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:28,030
inflammation.
Yeah.

352
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,990
Putting my scientist,
I don't mess around with

353
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,080
any of that.
THC infused stuff.

354
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:33,550
I liked it.
I liked the CBD.

355
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,653
THC,
when it comes to anything other than 

356
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:37,990
smoking it,
I do not play.

357
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,990
No.
What I like pal,

358
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,000
I like these joints that are wrapped in 
tobacco.

359
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,710
These backwoods,
Jeremy's.

360
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,550
These are my favorite because they give 
you like a little bit of elevation.

361
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,490
You get a little bit from the,
from the cigarette,

362
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,580
the nicotine that tobacco,
and then you get the weed.

363
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,900
Whoa.
Combo Corona and Modelo Corona.

364
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,753
Modelo was the first to take the plunge.
Investing hundreds of millions of 

365
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:03,974
dollars into a Canadian outfit,
nor to bring thc infused bruise to 

366
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:12,200
market in northern nation.
Now molson coors,

367
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,530
the second largest brewer in the world 
is reportedly getting into the game.

368
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,090
The game.
Yeah.

369
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:17,924
That's what's going to be interesting is
when like smirnoff starts investing in 

370
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:21,644
marijuana because they're going to.
It's a hundred percent legal in Canada 

371
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,560
now.
Canada is just.

372
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:31,130
It's just like buying a beer.
It's thank God Canada.

373
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,620
Any bad motherfuckers up there

374
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,800
and you can travel in Canada and fly 
with it.

375
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,763
Yeah.
Well I love you could fly into lax with 

376
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,180
wheat now.
Heck yeah.

377
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,063
Yeah.
They say whatever happens when you get 

378
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,320
there as on you,
right?

379
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,603
Yeah.
Did you see the thing that they have in 

380
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:45,284
Vegas?
They have dispensary like or dispensers 

381
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,333
for marijuana like at the airport and 
then people were breaking into them and 

382
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:55,100
they're stealing weed out of them.
Keeping that we.

383
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,280
And they said they're not free weed 
boxes.

384
00:16:58,281 --> 00:16:59,114
You assholes.
Was it crossing international borders 

385
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:03,530
with cannabis is illegal.
It's at the airport there.

386
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,573
Yeah.
But does that mean going back or 

387
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:10,400
landing?
You can bring it in or take it out,

388
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:12,290
but just saying like if you're at the 
airport,

389
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,600
just make sure you're standing here.
Isn't that interesting?

390
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,240
Like you can't even bring it in even 
though it's legal there.

391
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,670
Yeah,
it's weird.

392
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,390
There's the box.
Yeah.

393
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:24,650
There's the box disposal for 
prescription and recreational drug.

394
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,180
Is that in Canada?
One's in Canada,

395
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,770
but yet they haven't been denver.
Also.

396
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,180
I have the exact.
I have photo.

397
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,073
The exact same thing from Vegas.
I took a picture of a company that's 

398
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:33,404
supposed to come around and pick the 
shit up and for those of it you get you 

399
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:38,010
a little skinny arms in there.
Oh

400
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,380
God,
that is so funny.

401
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:42,470
It's a disposal all the times.
That last second.

402
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:44,900
I'm just throwing joint tubes into the.
Into the,

403
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,543
into the trashcan.
Like who would actually go up to that 

404
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,850
thing and throw it in there?
No one.

405
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:51,570
Let me.
Let me.

406
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,320
Let me tell you.

407
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,850
Yeah,
super fucked up.

408
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,800
Pot.
Old Toronto area cannabis.

409
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,830
Anna's amnesty cans.
That's hilarious.

410
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,663
This is just some guy laying on the 
ground with his mouth open and the 

411
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:05,754
bottom of that.

412
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,220
Tell me a story about a girl who was a.
She went into a Porta potty and she.

413
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,850
She thought she saw something like when 
she's sitting down and then she realized

414
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,570
she heard like groans.
She realized there was some guy in there

415
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
inside the Porta Potty,
just laying there,

416
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,434
watching the shit come out and hitting 
him in the head with his mouth open 

417
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,110
while she's shitting and pissing on him.
Oh my God.

418
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,940
Climbed in to this shit and Piss.

419
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,550
That is so disgusting and hot at the 
same time.

420
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,733
For some reason,
the fact that a monster would lay there 

421
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:41,824
like that,

422
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,560
he's probably got a fucking snorkel,
a Porta potty.

423
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:49,561
Pieper Luke Christo Suing Boulder for 
$99,999

424
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,960
or equal amount of gold coinage from 
Boulder,

425
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:02,220
Colorado.
He's suing boulder or so.

426
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,760
It happened in.
In Boulder.

427
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,670
Yeah.
Boulder's attribute placement.

428
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,563
People been getting really high in 
boulder for a long time and there's no 

429
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:13,210
air up there.
So if you get super baked in boulder,

430
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,220
like you could blow a fuse.

431
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,550
Look at that potty.
It's like built for that.

432
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:20,780
It looks like it's like a float tank 
top.

433
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,900
It's like a little.
You know what it's like.

434
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:27,490
It's like one of those first class seats
you get when you fly to Australia.

435
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,930
Oh yeah.
Little pod.

436
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,910
A pod.
It says what's just getting weird?

437
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,720
I don't know.
Oh,

438
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,553
hold on.
Chris Ko has made his mark on the 

439
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,444
internet under a variety of monikers,
including Omni Rainbow and Sky Oregon 

440
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,550
who youtube channel features,
clips,

441
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:47,384
including this one in which he 
demonstrates his thigh rubbing 

442
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:51,990
technique.
Videos,

443
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,190
not there for some reason.
Yeah.

444
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,640
I wonder why it's been pulled from the 
Internet.

445
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,450
So this is the guy.
So he was.

446
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,610
He climbed in there to have people shit 
on him.

447
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,040
And how did he know that there was a 
girl?

448
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,240
His reward for such patients was a site 
of a slender,

449
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,540
black haired white man.
What?

450
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,940
Wait a minute.
Don't scroll.

451
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,650
What are you going to know?
What the hell they're talking about?

452
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:19,140
But I'm reading that grow back a slender
sweat,

453
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,480
black haired white man standing between 
six point five and six foot eight inches

454
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:26,720
tall with cuts on his back and arms 
wearing only a pair of sweatpants.

455
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,640
What is this about?
Oh,

456
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:31,730
so this is the security guard realized 
that he was doing something.

457
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,050
Scroll back up to that.
Figure out what the other one.

458
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,083
Imagine like waiting there under the 
toilet in the Porta potty for a hot 

459
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:40,014
chick to come in.
And just like Joey Diaz comes in like 

460
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,413
I'm excited.

461
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,190
Sandwiches all week.
June 2011.

462
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:51,190
We noted that a woman attended the 
Hammond Festival,

463
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,670
stepped into a portable laboratory in 
which he lifted totes lid.

464
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,190
She saw something moving in the deep 
dark depths below q shock,

465
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,033
horror and quick escape.
Was She fetched a man and asked him to 

466
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,054
look inside?
He too saw some movement beneath a tarp 

467
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,760
inside the tank,
and after exiting the chamber,

468
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:14,380
he heard the door locked behind them.
At that point he summoned his security.

469
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,820
Okay.
That's what happened.

470
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:16,654
And then they caught that guy.
So he's in there with a tarp hiding 

471
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,150
under a tarp.
While people were shitting on him.

472
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,130
Look at his face.
Is that the mugshot?

473
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,910
Is their shit all over him?
Oh God.

474
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,953
Son of a bitch.
It's like the clown meets the shit 

475
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:33,311
clown.
Oh,

476
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:34,144
look at this.
He sat down with Fox 31 for a jailhouse 

477
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:41,020
interview in which you referred to 
spying on urinating or defecating.

478
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:44,920
Women in quotes,
the highest creature in the universe.

479
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:50,070
He maintained as in quotes,
praising God and said in quotes,

480
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,573
it sounds kind of weird,
but I would just find my peace and go 

481
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:56,644
away.
Say thank you goddess and go about my 

482
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:00,604
night.

483
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,100
Wow.
Isn't that the scariest part?

484
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:03,934
When you.
When you drop a deuce on the toilet and 

485
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,100
you hear the words,
thank you.

486
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:06,934
God is coming from the toilet.
You got us through your offerings just 

487
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,850
to other peoples and other places around
boulder.

488
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:15,390
Also just serve restaurants.
Just to know that

489
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,253
someone like that as a real person like 
do you have to realize sometimes you 

490
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:21,750
have to see someone like that to go,
oh,

491
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,820
okay.
I don't know everybody.

492
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,201
There's,
there's a,

493
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:26,034
there's a

494
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,790
long

495
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,200
range,
you know,

496
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,320
if there's a chart of like fucked up to 
like totally normal.

497
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,873
There's a lot of variables in there and 
there's a lot of people that just don't 

498
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:39,140
fit into your ideal.

499
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,163
Who knows?
We may know people that are into that 

500
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:44,460
type of thing.
We should set up like a tractor.

501
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,540
Skakel what?
What'd you say?

502
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,030
No,
I said we might know people.

503
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,100
Would you say earl?
Jeff.

504
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:57,010
Ross.
You say Jeff Ross,

505
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,240
you son of a bitch.
You should put.

506
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,093
Listen in.
Don't do that off camera and expect me 

507
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:06,030
to keep secrets.
We should put one of those watkins.

508
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,220
Just kidding folks.
Just we like,

509
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,090
we love those guys.
Just jokes.

510
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,510
Just jokes.
Oh yeah.

511
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,670
Do you think we do anything?
We know.

512
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:23,830
Anybody looks at your shit on Jim 
Norton.

513
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,830
Yeah,
maybe.

514
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,663
No worries.
It'll tell you we should put one behind 

515
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:27,424
the comedy store and see if anyone 
starts to like look it up and down and 

516
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,230
lay down in it.
You know,

517
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,610
they had this test they did with,
uh,

518
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,620
with men where they took men that were.
Now before we get any further,

519
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,930
I don't know who conducted these tests.
Jamie could probably find it.

520
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:44,810
Well,
they,

521
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,400
um,
they conducted

522
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,263
tests where they put devices on penises 
who talked about this was Christopher 

523
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,930
Ryan may have talked about this and 
maybe our friend Chris Ryan talked about

524
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:54,764
this.
They put sensors on penises and they 

525
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:58,544
showed homophobic men,
erotica and homosexual erotica in 

526
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:05,324
particular,
like guys getting their Dick sucked by 

527
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:11,330
guys and they got aroused by it.
They put these things on it.

528
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,360
So that's what we would need to do.
We need to like,

529
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,980
ah,
that'd be phobic.

530
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:18,440
Men are aroused by gay male porn.
Here it is.

531
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,270
Homophobia is associated with sexual 
excitement by male on male sex.

532
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,693
That's one study.
This is the greatest reality show ever 

533
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:29,820
in the making right now.

534
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,703
All right.
One study asked heterosexual men how 

535
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:37,060
comfortable and anxious they are around 
gay men based on these scores,

536
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,840
they then divided these into two groups,
men that are homophobic,

537
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:44,110
amended or not.
These men were then shown three,

538
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:46,500
four minute videos.
That's a long time.

539
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:48,310
You're sitting there watching to dude 
suck a dick.

540
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,170
One video depicted straight sex,
one,

541
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:52,004
two,
big depicted lesbian sex and one 

542
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:56,920
depicted gay male sex.
While this was happening,

543
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,950
a device that was attached to each 
participant's penis.

544
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,910
This device has been found to be 
triggered by sexual arousal,

545
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,080
but not by other types of arousal,
such as nervousness or fear.

546
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,910
Arousal often has a very different 
meaning in psychology.

547
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,530
Then improper usage.

548
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,880
Hmm.
Wonder what the device looks like.

549
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:17,923
It's just some dude's mouth to mouth.
Pretty sure this was a Japanese game 

550
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,144
show.
Experimental was they had a guy get 

551
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:28,160
blown by another dude and he had to last
a certain amount of time.

552
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,300
Oh,
I did hear that.

553
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,270
Kept them under a weight.
He had the last without coming.

554
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,113
He had to go four or five minutes or 
something without blowing a little kid 

555
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:36,740
when a bunch of money

556
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,573
and if a guy was sucking his dick is 
people don't realize that Japanese 

557
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:46,030
before fear factor Japanese game shows 
were on another level.

558
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,110
They were doing some fucking insane shit
on Japanese TV.

559
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,123
That was one of the.
Some of the early youtube clips we used 

560
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:56,180
to watch was Japanese game shows.

561
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,990
Those guys are way.
They're always ahead of it.

562
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,960
Ninja warrior.
Yeah.

563
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,841
Yeah.
Right.

564
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:04,300
Was that a Japanese show first?
I think so.

565
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,660
Yeah.
Should be when it first started,

566
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:11,580
like that's how it got onto the way it 
is because g four had a contest for like

567
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,423
the first American to go over and do it 
and it just sort of snowballed from 

568
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:16,354
there

569
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,243
and then they had that show that was 
kind of a version of it for America 

570
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:21,700
called wipe out.
Right.

571
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,553
Remember that because that was the same 
people that produced fear factor 

572
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,184
produced,
wipe out

573
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,403
MFC where they would like auto dm or did
the voice dubs and it would seem a 

574
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,770
little funny,
but they'd be like the waiters,

575
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,680
the service staff,
and it'd be almost a big joke.

576
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,140
Remember I'm talking about.
No,

577
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,610
it was called Mx.
see like I don't remember the full name.

578
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,370
I'll pull up a video and see.
So anyway,

579
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,033
we put these sensors on Earl's kcals 
Dick and have someone take a shit in 

580
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,260
front of.
I was like,

581
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,420
what the fuck?
What am I doing guys?

582
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,200
Nothing,
girl.

583
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,280
We're sorry.
We're just joking around.

584
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,650
Oh,
that girl got hit in the head kick.

585
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,573
Now here's the thing,
I can't help but thinking that ladies 

586
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,270
running through shit now after we talked
about,

587
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:09,900
I don't think I don't see that as mud.
It's just a silly Japanese show.

588
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:12,420
But here's the uh,
the other one I was telling you about,

589
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,460
this is the only,
I can only find it on live leak,

590
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:17,370
but it is a gay versus straight blow job
challenge.

591
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,920
Oh my God.
So who's the Gay Guy?

592
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,163
This big guy,
I believe the big guy's gay and the 

593
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:26,580
straight guy.
Wow.

594
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,930
This gay guy says those pants are hot,
and so this guy has to stand there,

595
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,940
see if we can get Takuya.
Oh my God.

596
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,220
Of course,
if he doesn't get hard,

597
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,950
see,
he might not get hard like this.

598
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,410
What does the expression mean?
Oh my God,

599
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,520
welcome to another episode of high speed
vacuum.

600
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,820
Puts his hand in his mouth.
His expression has changed dramatically.

601
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,000
Like,
wow,

602
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,120
it's always those fat guys that really 
sucked the best dicks.

603
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:03,270
I bet.
I love that.

604
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,170
At the end of that comment,
I don't have to say.

605
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,710
I bet I would imagine because it's like 
a comment.

606
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,040
This guy took his shirt off.
What happened there?

607
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,533
Shot.

608
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,920
Thank you.
I enjoyed that.

609
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,630
He says,
oh my God,

610
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,700
so that poor guy.
We have a winner.

611
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,100
Oh,
that poor guy.

612
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,770
Just not in that dude's mouth.
He says,

613
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,780
that's frustrating.
A lot came out,

614
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:28,740
didn't it?
He says,

615
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,810
it's so frustrating.
No.

616
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:31,980
Yeah,
but a lot came out.

617
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,780
Tell them.
The guy's like,

618
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:35,760
dude,
you enjoyed that.

619
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:36,780
You came really hard.
He was.

620
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,670
It was very frustrating because like,
yeah,

621
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:41,010
but a lot came out.
You came hard,

622
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,390
Yay.
But frustrating,

623
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,643
dumb like no,
but you liked it at the time because a 

624
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:47,730
lot came out.
I can only comes out if it feels good.

625
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,340
That is there evil that's fucking with 
the person's mind.

626
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,803
You know,
you guys to think about that shit for 

627
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,650
the rest of his life.
He's probably gay now.

628
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:01,830
He's probably on the other side of the 
game show second.

629
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,753
The reason why I would imagine fat guys 
suck Dick Betters because it involves 

630
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:07,860
food and and gay sex at the same time.

631
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,723
It's a combination of things like fat 
people probably like things in their 

632
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,910
mouth.
And then on top of that,

633
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,270
gay sex and Asian as well.
Kobiashi is the hot dog eating champion.

634
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,520
I thought you were going to go with a 
little Dick.

635
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,063
Uh,
we'll get the whole thing that you're 

636
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:27,480
not choking.
You could promote it.

637
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,300
You can really go to town and it might 
not even make it to your throat.

638
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:34,310
Just deep now flip it.
I don't know,

639
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,473
that's a terrible stereotype,
but I'm really embarrassed you brought 

640
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:38,400
that up on the show.
Yeah.

641
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,930
How dare you.
Indeed,

642
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,610
and if anybody knows things about 
stereotypes,

643
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:47,611
it's Asians and Megan Kelly.
That was an Asian Stereo.

644
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,953
Oh yeah.
Oh,

645
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,670
okay.
I get it.

646
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,780
Like Samsung.
Yeah,

647
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:53,650
exactly.
I get it.

648
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,633
Yeah.
Yeah.

649
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,520
Megan Kelly.
That's a crazy one.

650
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,980
That's a crazy one because she said dad 
did.

651
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,750
I never really got it all the way.

652
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,620
She said that back in her day,
people used to be black for Halloween.

653
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,023
She said,
why can't you dress up as like Diana 

654
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,240
Ross?
Yeah.

655
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,360
I guess she essentially said,
what's wrong with wearing blackface?

656
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,950
She's like,
why is it bad for she?

657
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,410
She threw one in.
That's not even really bad as it like.

658
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,373
She started with,
why is it bad for a black person to 

659
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:26,020
dress up as a white person or white 
person dress up as a black person?

660
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,033
Well,
it's not.

661
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,220
Nobody says it's bad for a black person 
who dressed up as a white person.

662
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:32,230
Dave Chappelle did it on his TV show 
forever.

663
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,530
Remember that we do that.
Nobody cared.

664
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,680
It's bad because these two have minstrel
shows,

665
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,430
like if she knew the history of it,
like you go to back and watch Al Jolson.

666
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,620
Have you ever watched some of that 
stuff?

667
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,590
A little bit,
but I mean we should watch some of that.

668
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,610
Okay.
The Al Jolson stuff.

669
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,660
Really what would happen?
We go to jail.

670
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,900
Just pc police,
youtube.

671
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,453
What about white chicks?
Remember white chicks when the Wayans 

672
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:00,940
brothers.
Uh Oh yeah.

673
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,710
They hit that whole movie where there 
were white face.

674
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:04,240
Huge movie.
Nobody cares.

675
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:06,190
Heavily promoted movie.
Funny movie.

676
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,210
Yeah,
you could.

677
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,760
You could be white.
Nobody cares.

678
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,310
So her saying that was very 
disingenuous.

679
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:14,770
It was just to cover our ass.
So that's Al Jolson.

680
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,680
So what does the jazz singer.
Al Jolson.

681
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,313
Yeah.
And look at what he used to do with his 

682
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:23,074
lips.
He used to make his lips cartoonishly 

683
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:30,781
exaggerated any would sing,
but he was like an obviously a white man

684
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,900
singing in black face as a black man.
It's,

685
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,080
it's really weird to watch.
And he would wear white gloves on,

686
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,750
is it wrong that I feel weird or 
watching this.

687
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:43,780
Then reading about the guy that was 
getting shit and pissed on,

688
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,510
is it wrong that you came quicker than 
the guy?

689
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,810
Man,
man,

690
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,480
that's crazy.
Pretty sure.

691
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:59,890
That was the first movie with sound also
was the first movie was sound,

692
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:00,724
was racist as fuck.
When you got to realize the first movie 

693
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:08,194
was sound.
Was that probably 19 one slash seven 

694
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,370
slash 27.
Okay.

695
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,520
So that is,
what is that 60 years after slavery?

696
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,303
That's after it was abolished,
but it wasn't even really done when it 

697
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:24,530
was abolished.
So yeah.

698
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,910
But when was it done?

699
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,680
Okay.

700
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,513
Arguably it isn't with jails,
but I mean there was still Jesus teach 

701
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,303
Jamie with deep were still.
They weren't all slaves weren't 

702
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,840
immediately twitter.
You got to them like

703
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,903
slaves weren't immediately released and 
when the law passed didn't just say 

704
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,620
you're free because that's a good point.
But what I meant was when I just like,

705
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,640
I don't know,
I don't know the date you're looking for

706
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,170
like it happened gradually over time.
So yeah,

707
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,850
because of civil war,
civil war ended in 18,

708
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:58,850
$75.
I wouldn't have did it ended at 65.

709
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:04,070
But the resolution to abolish slavery 
was passed proclamation that was 65,

710
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,963
64,
and then the civil war ended just a 

711
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:10,700
couple years later.
Right.

712
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,280
Space Proclamation,
January first 18,

713
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:14,720
63,
63,

714
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:19,310
and then the war ended 1865.
So that's not that long.

715
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,720
Like 60 years later they're doing.

716
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,230
You ever heard it?
It's so weird.

717
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,360
It's,
it's weird watching old movies.

718
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:30,370
Period.
Yeah,

719
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,890
they'd go like the 19 twenties and shit.
It's like it's.

720
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:34,711
So I,
I,

721
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:35,544
I've watched King Kong with my kids.
I had them watch the original King Kong 

722
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,290
and there were we going to be scared.
This was a few years back,

723
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:47,320
like when one was six and one was for,
look,

724
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,141
we're nervous.
Worse.

725
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:49,590
Can I go?
Don't be scared to.

726
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,500
It's not scary.
Just trust me.

727
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:54,020
You're gonna think it's funny.
They were laughing.

728
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,620
They thought it was so funny.
It looks so bad.

729
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,200
It looks so Corny,
right?

730
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,950
We're just cuddled up on the couch 
watching King Kong looks so corny.

731
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:04,784
Like the claymation or law.
It's just weird that back then that was 

732
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:10,814
a horror movie.
Like people would go to the movie like 

733
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,840
that was terrifying.
Yes,

734
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,010
it was.
I'm going to go get a sandwich.

735
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,100
My goodness.
I'm going to order coffee for a penny.

736
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,310
I saw the new Halloween movie the other 
day that it was awesome.

737
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,330
They actually did it.
They made a great movie.

738
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,910
Great reboot.
It was really awesome.

739
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:30,744
If you've ever enjoyed any moment or 
know anything about Michael Myers at 

740
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:35,580
all,
it's unbelievable.

741
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,500
Wow.
Really Great.

742
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,980
It's like modern day.
They make Jamie Lee curtis a bad ass.

743
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:42,900
Like she's like,
she's her age.

744
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:45,060
It's bothered her her whole life.
Every.

745
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:47,160
All anyone wants to talk with her about 
is that.

746
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:48,990
So she like lifted weights and shit.
She holds,

747
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:49,883
she holds herself up and this big.
She builds a compound with fences and 

748
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:54,504
everything in case he ever fucking comes
back and she teaches herself how to 

749
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:02,220
shoot.
Like it's like real awesome dude.

750
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,073
You fucking love it.
I couldn't believe it the rest of the 

751
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:07,620
night.
I was saying that my wife just just,

752
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:10,350
I can't believe how great that movie was
and she loved it too.

753
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,150
So it's like all around wow.
Honest,

754
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,620
rotten tomato say about it.
Those people are crazy.

755
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,220
I don't listen to any but any of these 
people's opinions.

756
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,810
I went to a yelp review the other day 
because,

757
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,673
uh,
there's this restaurant that I really 

758
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:29,450
liked this near my house and I said,
I wonder how it gets reviewed on Yelp.

759
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,790
And it was like all five stars except 
one,

760
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,500
one,
one star,

761
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,890
and it was like a crazy review or some 
woman was,

762
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,450
she was yelling,
she was complaining.

763
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:40,284
That tips that if you tip on a credit 
card that they don't get it until the 

764
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,560
end of the week and then it gets taxed.
Like,

765
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,630
is that how it always works or do you 
get it at night?

766
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,490
They cash you out?
It depends on the restaurant.

767
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,810
It depends on the restaurant,
but I felt like that was probably common

768
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,213
that some restaurants will give you with
your weekly check all your tips for 

769
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:03,534
that.
Typical.

770
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,673
Yeah,
that would be if like they're pulling 

771
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:07,094
perhaps all the tips of the week 
together and splitting it amongst 

772
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,200
everybody,
which only a really,

773
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,420
really,
really good restaurant with deal.

774
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,673
Oh,
that seems.

775
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,920
That seems like it doesn't encourage 
performance though,

776
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:22,400
right?
Well that at that level of restaurants,

777
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,260
the performances,
like a given,

778
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:25,094
like they're probably splitting vast 
sums of money because it's a full blown 

779
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:29,810
machine,
like a five star.

780
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,673
Exactly.
I worked at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse 

781
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,733
coming out of high school and I learned 
pretty much everything there is to know 

782
00:36:38,181 --> 00:36:41,180
that they make you memorize a stack of 
cards.

783
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:43,730
You have to know everything and the 
whole thing's a well oiled machine.

784
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:46,670
I was a food runner,
which basically means that I had to make

785
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:50,330
sure that everything going to the tables
was perfectly set up.

786
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:51,164
Like [inaudible].
There's no fixing it once it leaves the 

787
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:53,330
door.
Right.

788
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,163
So you're basically the final approver 
of everything and the servers just 

789
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:00,290
waiting at the table or follows behind 
you.

790
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,213
You set the tray down and they do it and
you get 10 percent of all the servers 

791
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:09,050
tips on the floor.
So sometimes some nights if there's,

792
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,360
you know,
uh,

793
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,080
say more than 10 to one food runner or a
servers to food runners,

794
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,780
you could make more than even a server 
at a ruth's Chris Steakhouse.

795
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,600
But each restaurant does it differently 
and splits tips.

796
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:21,434
Maybe they pull them that night.
Pulling the tips actually usually means 

797
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:26,720
that the service is going to be 
unbelievable.

798
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,583
Unless it's just a Janky restaurant.
Then they then they probably just do it 

799
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:31,030
normally.

800
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,530
Well this restaurant's very nice 
restaurant.

801
00:37:32,531 --> 00:37:33,221
Yeah.
So anyway,

802
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:35,620
I looked at this lady's a one star 
review,

803
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,670
like one star to five stars and I always
have a big smile on my face when I see a

804
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:40,504
one star review because that means this 
bitch going to have a lot of one star 

805
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,510
reviews.
If you go to her page to page,

806
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,650
it was all one star reviews.
This fucking malcontent,

807
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,663
this monster.
It was just going everywhere and 

808
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:56,800
complaining about everything from 
fucking nail salons to movie theaters.

809
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:57,634
Like everything.

810
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,503
It's crazy.
I don't think trolls and know that 

811
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:00,964
anybody is just one click away from 
knowing from them being completely 

812
00:38:04,901 --> 00:38:06,820
exposed.
I think it's the same thing,

813
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:08,920
you know,
on twitter or really anything,

814
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:11,260
right?
You see someone say something crazy,

815
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:14,650
you just click on their profile and it's
all crazy.

816
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,740
All crazy all the time to everybody.
Yeah.

817
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,870
They're complaining about everything.
I think

818
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:20,803
after Roseanne was on,
I got a bunch of people that tweeted at 

819
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:29,681
me with these wacky conspiracies like 
wacky mind control conspiracies and what

820
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:34,940
would it seemed to me to be.
I'm not a professional,

821
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,010
but if I had

822
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:41,010
to guess a wave of mentally ill people 
were contacting me and I was,

823
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,400
I was reading this.
I'm like,

824
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:43,234
Jesus Christ.
How many people are out there that 

825
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:46,234
believe like the most nuttiest,
CIA based mind control experiments and 

826
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,620
NSA,
you know,

827
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,723
tapping into everything in your home and
listening to your conversations by 

828
00:38:57,941 --> 00:39:00,940
listening to the vibrations off of your 
window panes,

829
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,220
like,
here's what people don't know.

830
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,490
Who's got time for that?
Here's the thing.

831
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,563
Do you really think there's enough 
people in the world to be paying 

832
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,550
attention to all the people in the 
world?

833
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,130
Does that make any sense to you?
It shouldn't.

834
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,200
There's no way.
Everybody's watching everybody.

835
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,473
There's not enough people.
See like if you do something like say 

836
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,790
Tony Hinchcliffe runs for President,
oh,

837
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:26,740
they're going to fucking watch you.
For sure.

838
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,633
They're going to find out what?
Why is Tony Hinchcliffe friend for 

839
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:32,470
president who's backing him?
Is it George Soros who's looking out for

840
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,990
Tony Hinchcliffe?
You know who's trying,

841
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,020
who's fourth?
Yeah,

842
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,770
they'll check you out,
but the average person is like,

843
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,440
remembered that Mel Gibson movie 
conspiracy theory,

844
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,453
remember that he played a mentally ill 
person who fell in love with Julia 

845
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,003
Roberts.
He was like a hot mentally ill person 

846
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,193
and uh,
he just believed everything was a 

847
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,570
conspiracy theory.
I'm watching the other day,

848
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,933
like out of nowhere,
it was on tv and I saw watched us for a 

849
00:39:58,601 --> 00:39:59,800
little bit and I was like,
wow,

850
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,210
fucking wacky.
This movie,

851
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,900
people that have schizophrenia don't 
realize that their schizophrenia,

852
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,003
exact people with bipolar notice,
they might be aware that they're having 

853
00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:12,590
an episode.
People OCD,

854
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:17,270
they're ocd add add schizophrenia.
It's game set.

855
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:18,104
Match.
You start hearing the voices become a 

856
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:20,834
normal thing.
Like you think everybody can hear them 

857
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,970
and you're not really acknowledging them
because they become so natural.

858
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:31,350
The schizophrenia person can be in a 
psych ward and say to their doctor,

859
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,520
why am I here?
And that's a breakthrough.

860
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

861
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,003
Do you know Matt Mark Marin?
Heard voices in his head for over a 

862
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,510
year.
Oh my goodness.

863
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,120
After partying with kinison.
Wow.

864
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,620
That's a hard Kennison.
Pardon?

865
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,540
Yeah.
Were pussies,

866
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,660
man.
We really are.

867
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:54,661
I was talking to artist the other day at
the back door and it's just like,

868
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,610
my God,
I literally said the words.

869
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,470
I'm like,
I wish I was.

870
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,260
I wish I had started back when you 
started,

871
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:03,990
man.
Really?

872
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,970
Because he was talking about.
We ended up getting off on this whole.

873
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:09,880
I don't know how we got there,
but we started off on this whole tangent

874
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:10,714
about,
uh,

875
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,250
about just,
you know,

876
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:14,230
sobriety and stuff.
And he's like,

877
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:15,700
man,
you know,

878
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,070
back in my day.
And he was,

879
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,890
I can't remember the exact dialogue,
but it was just.

880
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,960
Yeah,
I mean those guys were all.

881
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,520
It was all just a blur.

882
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,613
I learned something from Argus.
Argus runs like insane numbers of miles 

883
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:31,710
every day,
like 12 miles,

884
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:34,310
15 miles a day.
The addict in him,

885
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:37,670
the guy that loved getting wasted,
that's his high now.

886
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:39,680
He talks about it all the time is 
runner's high.

887
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,660
It's real good.
It's real.

888
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,320
I know now because of this month,
this month is sober.

889
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:46,280
October month,
dude,

890
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:49,730
I've worked out no less than at least 
two hours.

891
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:52,280
That's a small workout,
a small workout with.

892
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:55,490
That's all I could get in was two hours 
the longest I did.

893
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:57,980
I did six hours one day.
Good Lord.

894
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:01,580
Six hours of insane cardio.
It's like both kill bills.

895
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,443
I did seven.
I did seven hours of cardio in the last 

896
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:06,740
two days between yesterday and the day 
before.

897
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,560
Seven hours of hard cardio,
different stuff,

898
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,543
running the hills with the dog 
elliptical machine or meeting with fat 

899
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:16,250
people.
Right now I'm competing with myself.

900
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,403
First of all,
my main competition is already should 

901
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:22,490
fear and whether you realize it or not 
are should fear,

902
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:26,240
even though he doesn't exercise.
Ari has a strong mind.

903
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,470
He's a very strong mind.
Already ran 15 miles the other day.

904
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,513
Fifteen miles.
He rode five kilometers and then after 

905
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:36,770
he wrote five kilometers,
he um,

906
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,840
he did something else.
He rode his bike.

907
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,460
He rode a bike for a certain amount of 
miles,

908
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,310
15 miles.
The whole thing.

909
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,350
His whole workout was,
I think four hours.

910
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,240
My goodness.
He's got that power Giugiaro.

911
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,750
He's got that escape from concentration 
camp.

912
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,820
Gene Dude,
he's,

913
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,690
he's,
you saw a fucking heart.

914
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:56,150
He was going on the rowing machine.
He goes hard dude.

915
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,000
He stayed in the 80 percent on the 
rowing machine for an hour.

916
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,550
I mean he really did.
I saw him.

917
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,230
I was out there with them.
I filmed it.

918
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,093
I put it up on instagram at that point 
when burt was making fun of him for 

919
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,930
being at 75 for just walking.

920
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,763
Isn't that him being out of shape?
It's not because when Burton him went 

921
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:15,080
walking,
he was in way better shape than bird see

922
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,943
our.
He rides his bike in New York and he 

923
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:20,420
walks a lot in New York and even though 
he's not in great shape,

924
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,720
like in terms of like a guy who runs in 
comparison to Bert,

925
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,450
he's in fantastic shape.
When they went hiking together,

926
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:27,284
bird had a stop like a bunch of times,
but we were still up and I was pissed 

927
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:31,490
off.
He's like,

928
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,960
why do I have to stop?
Because you're fat.

929
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,500
Like.
Yeah.

930
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:35,803
So like he wanted to see what would 
happen if the two of them went out 

931
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:40,770
together and did the exact same hiking,
who's,

932
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,100
because Bert was saying,
oh,

933
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,440
it's because you're not insured,
so your heart is always at 80 percent.

934
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,373
No red in a week is in way better shape 
that bird is in this whole life of 

935
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:53,300
working out and drinking vodka every 
night compared to bird.

936
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,553
But compared to burt.
But my point is he was my real 

937
00:43:57,111 --> 00:43:58,600
competition.
I was very,

938
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,880
very much worried about him.
So up until,

939
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,710
uh,
two days ago,

940
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,700
everything seemed to be going good.
I was working out really hard and uh,

941
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:08,930
I was,
it was hard.

942
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,900
It's hard to do three hours a day.
It's three and a half hours a day.

943
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,570
Two days in a row is three and a half 
hours a day.

944
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,153
Um,
but I started paying and he started 

945
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:20,030
coming out dark.
Oh No,

946
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,010
like iced tea.
Oh Shit.

947
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:23,840
This sounds like a guy at a Porta 
potties.

948
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:27,730
Dream.
Sweet tea.

949
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,243
Sweet tea.

950
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,690
What is it?
What does he say at the end?

951
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,910
Oh bless you.
God bless you.

952
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:36,250
Got It.

953
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,600
For your sweet tea,
I was famished.

954
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,140
Yeah.
It didn't look good today.

955
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,590
I had to go to something in my kid's 
school list,

956
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,440
some Halloween thing and I had to go up 
three flights of stairs,

957
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,230
free long flights of stairs.
I got to talk.

958
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,970
First of all,
I barely made it upstairs.

959
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,280
I got to the top.
I was out of breath.

960
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,620
My legs were shaking.
Whoa.

961
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,870
Three flights of stairs.
And I was like,

962
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,800
okay,
I might have fucked up.

963
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,290
Oh man,
that was today.

964
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,680
Today.
What does it mean?

965
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,200
Um,
I think my body's breaking down.

966
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,190
I think I've got like serious muscle 
breakdown to the point.

967
00:45:18,191 --> 00:45:21,010
Like my muscles are so sore that I,
I've,

968
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,190
I'm ignoring that they're sore and even 
though they're really,

969
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:25,024
really sore,
I'm still doing like three hours of 

970
00:45:26,441 --> 00:45:29,020
cardio.
Like I limped up to the,

971
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:29,854
uh,
to the trail when I ran with my dog 

972
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:32,494
yesterday.
And then I ran two miles and then after 

973
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:35,284
I ran two miles,
I did an hour and a half on the 

974
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:37,924
elliptical machine.
And then after I did an hour and a half 

975
00:45:39,581 --> 00:45:42,880
on the elliptical machine,
I did 45 minutes of kicking the bag,

976
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,863
punching and kicking me.

977
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,210
I took two naps yesterday,
two separate maps.

978
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,323
My point is argus taught me something by
telling me about this high that you get 

979
00:45:54,521 --> 00:45:55,354
from all this cardio and also kind of 
fucking nonsense that I knew that there 

980
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,340
was like an endorphin high,
but I didn't.

981
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,193
I didn't think it was a really specific.
But there's a very specific high that 

982
00:46:04,271 --> 00:46:05,104
you get and it's like if you could take 
a pill that puts you in the state of 

983
00:46:09,461 --> 00:46:11,770
mind that I am when I work out this 
much,

984
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:12,903
everybody would take it in the world 
would be a better place because you 

985
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:15,730
don't give a fuck,
right?

986
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,303
You don't give a fuck about anything.
I mean not they don't care about people 

987
00:46:19,481 --> 00:46:21,250
and friends and loved ones,
but there's no.

988
00:46:21,251 --> 00:46:23,950
Anxiety is no.
All the chatter,

989
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,370
all the negative chatter that you get,
any brand that you have to like push off

990
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:29,890
and ignore,
let's shuts off.

991
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,773
Right.
Gone.

992
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,633
Nonexistent.
And I wonder how much of that is there 

993
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,373
because your brain is almost trying to 
create problems and conflict because 

994
00:46:40,271 --> 00:46:41,104
you're not getting enough exercise 
because your body supposed to get a 

995
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:45,040
specific amount of exercise.

996
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,193
My dog is a,
I think like eight months old or 

997
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:52,020
something now and I've learned a lot 
from having this dog this time.

998
00:46:52,021 --> 00:46:52,854
Like I didn't notice a lot of stuff with
the other dogs that I've raised in the 

999
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:56,334
past because in the past,
because with this one it's very clear 

1000
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,383
and I mean they're all that way,
but if you don't work it out you don't 

1001
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,960
take it and exercise it.
She's crazy.

1002
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:07,933
She,
she can be a nut and she shows you by 

1003
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,920
being weird.
Not necessarily destroying stuff,

1004
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,413
but you know,
just the being weird little things by 

1005
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,540
nibbling at your finger different way 
with just her little front teeth.

1006
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:23,670
Like sorta like telling you something 
like,

1007
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:24,504
hey dude,
I need to fuck and get some exercise in 

1008
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:29,380
and we're all that.
We're where we are that same way.

1009
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:34,381
So our brain is going to make more 
complex ways for us to be freaked out.

1010
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,940
Basically run for our lives,
right?

1011
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,070
Like if I don't just,
I mean again,

1012
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:44,071
I barely do cardio but I do do it pretty
consistently,

1013
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:46,150
but it's short.
It's like a mile or two.

1014
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,090
That's all you need.
Real.

1015
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:47,924
Yeah.
But.

1016
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:48,763
And it cleanses the palate.
It's like ginger between Sushi slices 

1017
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:54,790
and,
and if I go without it,

1018
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:55,923
absolutely it compiles.
I'll wake up bitter and angry about 

1019
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:01,360
something.
I'll see something on you know somewhere

1020
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:05,650
something or you're workwise and stress 
out about it and like why?

1021
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:07,770
Oh well this and that and stuff

1022
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,680
doesn't make any sense at all.
Yeah.

1023
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:11,400
And if you were in a good state of mind,
you'd be like,

1024
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,440
Eh,
who gives a fuck?

1025
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,180
Exactly.
But instead you dwell on it.

1026
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,073
Yeah.
So your brain's like trying to come up 

1027
00:48:15,981 --> 00:48:17,150
with problems.
Yeah,

1028
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,513
because he wants us to do something.
My Dog Marshall's like that hardcore 

1029
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:22,483
because Marshall's and shape,
because he runs miles with me all the 

1030
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:28,580
time so that dog's ready to go.
And so it's like we're running,

1031
00:48:28,581 --> 00:48:29,630
right?
We're running today.

1032
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,111
I'm like,
no,

1033
00:48:30,111 --> 00:48:31,050
not today dude.
I got to work.

1034
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,570
Fuck am I gonna do with myself,
right.

1035
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,730
I'll just start chewing socks and you 
know,

1036
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:37,520
doing things that he's not supposed to 
do.

1037
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,010
He just,
you know,

1038
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,660
he's just a ball of energy,
but a lease he doesn't have like anxiety

1039
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:45,494
and negative chatter.
The complex human mind when it doesn't 

1040
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:48,374
have enough energy output,
I always think of the brain is almost 

1041
00:48:50,331 --> 00:48:51,164
like a battery that has a lid on it and 
it's like energy is flowing out of the 

1042
00:48:54,861 --> 00:48:55,694
battery and spilling over the sides and 
causing a mess because you gotta expand 

1043
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:03,290
or expand a certain amount of energy 
every day in order to keep it clean,

1044
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,400
just to keep everything going.

1045
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,180
Well,
yeah,

1046
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,500
dude,
I feel fucking great other than the fact

1047
00:49:07,501 --> 00:49:08,360
that I can't walk.
Good.

1048
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,670
Yeah,
but it's just.

1049
00:49:10,671 --> 00:49:12,770
I went too hard.
It's just too hard,

1050
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,933
but I wanted to get so far ahead.
My goal was to get so far ahead that no 

1051
00:49:18,111 --> 00:49:22,010
one could catch up was like I just,
they could do these big days.

1052
00:49:22,011 --> 00:49:22,844
Every now and then I go,
but it's hard to do a big day and then 

1053
00:49:25,641 --> 00:49:27,590
do another big day and then do another 
big day.

1054
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:30,370
That's what's hard and that's where I'll
get them.

1055
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,450
I'll get them in the like the like when 
you wake up you're like,

1056
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,980
not today.
That's the day you got to go.

1057
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,150
That's like I'd wanted to put some 
distance between them.

1058
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,240
So what I did was I did one day where I 
did six hours.

1059
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:46,840
I did five hours in the morning and then
I actually five and a half.

1060
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:49,720
Then I did another hour at night,
so it was basically six and a half hours

1061
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,600
and I got a thousand points for the day 
and they were like,

1062
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:55,570
what the thousand,
35 actually

1063
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,633
guarantee you that when Marin was 
hearing those voices during that 

1064
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,690
Kennison time that he wasn't working 
out.

1065
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,553
No,
he doesn't work it out now and I think 

1066
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,473
it's easy for a comedian and not work 
out and then when you factor that in 

1067
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:14,280
that it's not a normal job and you can 
go from your bed to your car,

1068
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,190
to the venue to sit down.
At a table to wait till you go onstage,

1069
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,630
then you do that.
You stand up.

1070
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,140
I don't think that had anything to do 
with it.

1071
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,990
I think it was cocaine.
They did so much cocaine.

1072
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:27,980
They were up for days.
That's what it was.

1073
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,070
He broke his brain and physically not 
doing anything right.

1074
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:31,963
That too.
But I mean I think the big factor was 

1075
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:37,690
the cocaine doing cocaine with Kennison.
I think he just popped a fuse.

1076
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,250
You imagine fucking up for days and days
and kinases like where's the blood?

1077
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,990
Where's the blood?
And you're like,

1078
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,120
I'm only 22,
man.

1079
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:49,040
I gotta get Outta here.
I have a future.

1080
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:51,000
I have a life.
Oh Man.

1081
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,190
You know,
he,

1082
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,023
he.
Do you know that he kennison and 

1083
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,380
Roseanne have something really serious 
in common.

1084
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,513
They were both hit by cars when they're 
very young and their personality 

1085
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,770
radically changed.
Wow.

1086
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

1087
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:08,450
And that was one of the things that I 
really wanted to cover with Rosanne when

1088
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:09,284
I had her on the podcast because all 
these people were calling her a racist 

1089
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:12,134
and all right,
and this and that and all these 

1090
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:14,000
different things.

1091
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,833
I'm like,
listen,

1092
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,480
you don't understand this woman,
first of all,

1093
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,190
one of the greatest standup comics of 
all time.

1094
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,150
Yup.
Second,

1095
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:22,303
mentally ill and talks about it openly 
and is very honest about her troubles 

1096
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:27,194
and what happened.
She was committed to a mental 

1097
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:30,470
institution for nine months after this 
car accident.

1098
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,830
I mean she was hitting the fucking head 
by a car.

1099
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,980
The car was driving,
the sunlight was in her face.

1100
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:39,240
She couldn't see clip during the 
intersection,

1101
00:51:39,241 --> 00:51:40,074
sent her flying.
She was in intensive care for a long 

1102
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:44,954
fucking time in a coma for a long 
fucking time payment out of it was 

1103
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:50,420
fucked up,
couldn't concentrate in school,

1104
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,510
and then he committed her to a mental 
institution for nine months.

1105
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,930
Could lead name.
That is a long time.

1106
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,823
Yeah,
the hood ornament spiked her fucking 

1107
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:01,070
head.
Yeah.

1108
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,413
So when people are talking about her,
like this is all something that she 

1109
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:06,860
planned out because she's an evil 
person.

1110
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,850
That's like saying to a person who has a
broken leg,

1111
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,500
why you limping?
Yeah.

1112
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,423
It's really like that.
Like one of the reasons why she was so 

1113
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:17,534
brilliant as a comedian other than she 
worked hard and she writes and she just 

1114
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:22,903
got a great mind for it.
One of the reasons was she truly was 

1115
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:28,383
like incredibly impulsive and insane and
this is what allowed her to say things 

1116
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,340
that other people wouldn't say.
Especially back then.

1117
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:38,174
Like people have to realize when 
Roseanne Barr was huge and she was huge 

1118
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,930
before I ever did comedy.
She was huge.

1119
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,480
When she was huge,
there was no women like her.

1120
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,090
No one.
She was fat.

1121
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,980
She didn't give a fuck.
She would go onstage.

1122
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,970
You should talk mad shit would be 
hilarious.

1123
00:52:55,971 --> 00:52:58,550
She would kill.
She would kill dude.

1124
00:52:58,970 --> 00:52:59,803
I remember watching her kill like on Hbo
when I was like probably like 18 or 

1125
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:04,874
something like that.

1126
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,850
He's want to Mitsis true like success 
stories.

1127
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:10,350
Right.
Did you guys talk about that?

1128
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,333
Her being on in the main room and then 
being on like Carson weeks later she 

1129
00:53:14,971 --> 00:53:18,960
booked Carson and one of her posts about
that the first time we might not have.

1130
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,410
Yeah.
It's hard to remember these.

1131
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,263
A comedy store,
like for comedy store fans and 

1132
00:53:24,211 --> 00:53:27,210
historians,
she's like an anomaly because I'm pretty

1133
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:31,770
sure her first ever spot as a paid 
regular was in the main room,

1134
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,633
which was a big deal at the time and 
from that spot she got the tonight show 

1135
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,333
like a week or two later,
like she got booked from her first paid 

1136
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:44,580
regular spot to the tonight show from 
the tonight show.

1137
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,970
Goddess sitcoms like was a huge 
overnight success.

1138
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,920
So it all went like bing,
bing.

1139
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,993
Burl.

1140
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,980
Yeah.
That one thing that you talked about the

1141
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,190
first time she did the POC,
Jasper,

1142
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:55,860
that she lost her mind when all that was
going on.

1143
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,160
She was like,
oh,

1144
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,130
I went crazy.
I lost my mind.

1145
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:05,250
That kind of pressure to go from being a
housewife and Denver until like a couple

1146
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,030
of years later being one of the biggest 
stars in the world like that.

1147
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,493
Yeah.

1148
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,020
There's no the APP it takes,
it takes.

1149
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,960
Oh yeah.
That would drive anybody crazy.

1150
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,033
The whole thing's crazy because also 
waiting for it's crazy and working 

1151
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:23,680
towards it's crazy and the whole thing's
crazy,

1152
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:26,410
so to get it all at once,
that seems crazier than anything because

1153
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:27,370
then you're like,
oh my God,

1154
00:54:27,371 --> 00:54:29,470
I'm not ready for this.
What am I going to do?

1155
00:54:29,471 --> 00:54:31,450
At least most of the time in show 
business,

1156
00:54:31,451 --> 00:54:32,560
right?
It takes 10,

1157
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:33,610
15,
20,

1158
00:54:33,611 --> 00:54:35,710
25 years,
sit in.

1159
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:36,610
You're usually like,
um,

1160
00:54:36,611 --> 00:54:38,320
I've been ready for this.

1161
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,590
Or you do all those years and then 
you're an oversight overnight.

1162
00:54:41,591 --> 00:54:43,060
Success like Tiffany Haddish,
right?

1163
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,223
Tiffany haddish did a bunch of years and
then out of nowhere she becomes this 

1164
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:48,560
giant success.
Yeah.

1165
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:49,503
You know,
but she prepared by doing all those 

1166
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:54,220
years for Roseanne.
Barr was like instantaneous.

1167
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,833
You know,
the thing that bothered me most about 

1168
00:54:56,891 --> 00:55:01,060
all that stuff was how quickly everyone 
wanted to just cancel her,

1169
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,630
get rid of her,
like stop her from working ever again.

1170
00:55:04,631 --> 00:55:08,800
Do I don't want to hear her side of it.
There's no room for explanation.

1171
00:55:08,801 --> 00:55:12,280
There's no room for discussion.
There's no room for this.

1172
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,240
Just get rid of her.

1173
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,740
We went from wanting to see people 
become stars.

1174
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:17,574
American idol.
America's got talent to watching 

1175
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:23,220
people's dreams get destroyed.
That's the new obsession.

1176
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,000
The new thing is we've seen people make 
it.

1177
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,980
Let's watch the dream.
Get crushed.

1178
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:30,930
You are already rich.
Get outta here.

1179
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:32,940
Get outta here.
Get outta here.

1180
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:34,020
Roseanne,
get outta here.

1181
00:55:34,021 --> 00:55:36,150
Kanye.
It's like these people.

1182
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:37,620
I mean,
except for trump.

1183
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,910
I mean trump's,
its own thing,

1184
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:43,911
but like trying to like destroy people 
that are artists is,

1185
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,600
it's the weirdest thing.
Well,

1186
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:47,050
it's

1187
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:47,883
hold that are on the outside that are 
watching these people live these 

1188
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:54,490
spectacular lives and if,
if something goes wrong,

1189
00:55:54,491 --> 00:55:57,700
they're happy because then that person 
has to be a regular person again or even

1190
00:55:57,701 --> 00:55:58,780
worse.
They have to be a.

1191
00:55:58,781 --> 00:56:00,700
has been.
Which people love.

1192
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,110
People love a hospital.
Yeah.

1193
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,393
I can remember one guy was shitting on 
Gary Coleman because Gary Coleman was 

1194
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,654
the security guard.
I was having this conversation with 

1195
00:56:08,891 --> 00:56:10,880
them.
He's like laughing that uh,

1196
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,733
Gary Coleman from different strokes.
That was the show was a security guard 

1197
00:56:15,731 --> 00:56:16,680
and he's like,
that fucking guy,

1198
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,120
a security guard now man.
And I was like,

1199
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:19,983
okay,
but if you saw like a regular security 

1200
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:22,090
guard,
would you go,

1201
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,870
ha fucking guys security guard,
you wouldn't do that,

1202
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:26,980
right?
You'd go,

1203
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:28,270
oh,
there's a security guard.

1204
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,141
Hey,
what's up man?

1205
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:30,310
Yeah,
I'm going to building three.

1206
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,870
Here's my id.
It'd be normal.

1207
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,040
Right?
But because he was famous being security

1208
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:36,874
cards a joke and he's a loser.
Like there was joy in glee and this guy 

1209
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:42,544
describing how Gary Coleman,
who is born with the disease mean these 

1210
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:47,823
deformed,
these tiny person with a fucked up body 

1211
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,240
has his whole body's a mess.
I mean,

1212
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:54,060
he's a,
he's physically a,

1213
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,083
his health is fucked up.
And this guy was taking joy out of the 

1214
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:01,720
fact that he was a security guard now.
I was like,

1215
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:02,554
wow,
this is.

1216
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,473
There's a weird tendency that people 
have to wait to watch people that they 

1217
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:09,880
think had it better than them fall.
Yeah.

1218
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,870
The guy that,
uh,

1219
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,610
was bagging groceries from 
whatchamacallits.

1220
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,453
What does that.

1221
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,580
The cosby show?
Yeah.

1222
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,830
Yeah,
yeah.

1223
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,473
Yeah.
Apparently Tyler Perry gave that guy a 

1224
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,570
job.
Oh,

1225
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,310
shout out to Tyler Perry.
Okay.

1226
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,090
Yeah,

1227
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:27,120
he said was the guy is a grocery bag

1228
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,290
double the money?
Yeah,

1229
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,133
no,
he said,

1230
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,690
I love the fact that guys hustling.
He's out there working.

1231
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,310
There's no shame in working.
Right.

1232
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,430
The fact that people are so obsessed 
with that,

1233
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,293
that there is a.
there's a shame in it is a shame and 

1234
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,670
just having a job and working.
It's very strange.

1235
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,820
It's very strange how people are 
attached to that.

1236
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,360
You know,
that they,

1237
00:57:50,361 --> 00:57:51,194
they,
they,

1238
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:55,030
they immediately think that this is 
something to mock and make fun of.

1239
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:55,990
You know?
I mean,

1240
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,823
it was almost universal.
So many people were doing stories on 

1241
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:01,180
that guy bagging groceries.
Yeah.

1242
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,070
It's the age we live in,
man.

1243
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,610
People want to see people break.
If anybody's doing anything,

1244
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,980
there's a chance.
They're just waiting.

1245
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,950
May people are so mad.
Look if,

1246
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,370
if Megan Kelly,
if we didn't know what her contract was,

1247
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:17,720
right?
If it was just some,

1248
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,583
in fact,
let's say we did know and let's say she 

1249
00:58:19,881 --> 00:58:22,970
was getting paid barely what we would 
ever guess,

1250
00:58:22,971 --> 00:58:24,350
right?
Let's say she's getting paid,

1251
00:58:24,351 --> 00:58:25,880
I don't know,
100,000

1252
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:30,410
dollars a year at her new job at NBC.
She'd probably still have the jobs.

1253
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,870
Right?
I mean it's the whole crazy part is that

1254
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:37,640
we all know she got paid $68,000,000
for three years.

1255
00:58:37,641 --> 00:58:39,500
For what?
Right.

1256
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,950
That's the whole take.
So it's like analyze and get.

1257
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,790
You know what people are watching.
Like what'd she just say about Halloween

1258
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,870
costume.
That's it.

1259
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,550
We got it.
We got her.

1260
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,250
Yeah.
Did you ever hear it?

1261
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,460
Play it Meghan.
Kelly Shit.

1262
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,700
Which you guys have bundle.
Which comment?

1263
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,690
Like the apology or the original?
No,

1264
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,050
apologies.
It was hilarious.

1265
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,093
This woman said that some woman from 
Australia said that it seems like a 

1266
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:05,874
hostage video.
The only thing that's missing is her 

1267
00:59:06,991 --> 00:59:08,700
holding up a newspaper with a date on 
it.

1268
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:15,950
I retweeted La is soda and then somebody
else said if there's one of the.

1269
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,920
One of the things about it that's so 
strange is how insincere seems like

1270
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,060
forced,
like some of forrester.

1271
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,460
Tara apology.
Yeah.

1272
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:27,110
Oh yeah.
He apologized for it.

1273
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,320
Now I haven't seen that,
but the Brits forget the apology.

1274
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:32,060
Let's play the actual video.
Actually I remember,

1275
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:33,500
if I remember correctly,
it's two comments.

1276
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:35,650
She makes one and then they come back.
Oh really?

1277
00:59:35,651 --> 00:59:38,000
I think the second comment I think was 
the real issue.

1278
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:39,140
Yeah.
What was the first comment?

1279
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,080
I don't remember.
I don't remember.

1280
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,600
So there was a controversy on the real 
housewives of New York with Luanne.

1281
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,300
If she dresses Diana Ross and she made 
her skin look darker than it really is,

1282
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:53,120
and people said that that was racist and
I don't know.

1283
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:55,280
I felt like.
Who doesn't love Diana Ross?

1284
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:56,114
She wants to look like Diana Ross for 
one day and I don't know how that got 

1285
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:00,350
racist on Halloween.

1286
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:05,630
It appeared to be.
See that's the first one is it?

1287
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,980
But it's weird when you watch it now,
like you know,

1288
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,083
this is her demise,
like you're watching the stumble when 

1289
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:17,390
she trips off the rock and falls off the
cliff.

1290
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,720
This is the stumble,
like I don't get it.

1291
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,590
How is that racist to want to be Diana 
Ross then play it again?

1292
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,503
Yeah.
Halloween,

1293
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,960
like I was a kid.
That was okay.

1294
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:30,810
As long as you were dressing up as 
characters

1295
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,730
and that was just some guys commentary 
from Wall Street Journal that was a wrap

1296
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:40,200
and also have my favorite one of hers 
that she ever said.

1297
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,770
No.
My favorite one of hers that she.

1298
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,243
We're good.
Yeah.

1299
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:45,263
My favorite one of her she ever said was
they were doing this thing on Fox News 

1300
01:00:48,661 --> 01:00:52,020
about Santa Claus and someone had 
something about Santa Claus being black.

1301
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:56,040
They did something about Santa Claus 
being black and she just went,

1302
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:00,720
oh well Santa Claus is definitely white,
and she was like,

1303
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:03,870
I think she sent it to kids like kids.
Santa Claus is definitely right.

1304
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,063
Or kids.
Santa Claus is real and he's definitely 

1305
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,470
white.
I forget what the exact terminology was,

1306
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:11,723
but she basically said Santa clauses.
Definitely white like Santa Claus in 

1307
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:15,940
fucking real.
Okay.

1308
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:17,640
That's like saying Spiderman is 
definitely white.

1309
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,220
She didn't get fired from Fox for saying
that.

1310
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:22,970
She probably got a raise for saying that
they licked her toes.

1311
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,840
Whole different thing at Fox.
Well,

1312
01:01:24,841 --> 01:01:26,520
it was.
Then they don't want to know.

1313
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,080
Yeah.
She wanted to go back.

1314
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:28,770
No,
no,

1315
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,570
we're good.
Yeah,

1316
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:31,404
they want him to take her back.
The thing is you can't go from being an 

1317
01:01:34,051 --> 01:01:39,051
ice princess and the conservative right 
wing channel to being like Oprah would.

1318
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:41,910
She's trying to be like Oprah.
I don't.

1319
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:42,803
I.
I'll never really get what MBC was 

1320
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:46,370
thinking.
They're thinking Shewchuk.

1321
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,470
He was just going to come over.
That's exactly what they thought.

1322
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:56,880
They thought she has a giant fan base,
but she had a fan base for sure.

1323
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,650
Some came over,
but she,

1324
01:01:58,651 --> 01:02:03,010
a lot of her fan base was because she 
was the beautiful conservative woman who

1325
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,340
was a very tough,
very articulate,

1326
01:02:05,341 --> 01:02:07,350
very smart,
you know,

1327
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:08,243
and they liked that she was an ice 
princess and she would shut people down 

1328
01:02:11,441 --> 01:02:14,250
if they're incorrect and she wouldn't 
let people talk over her.

1329
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:16,890
She was powerful.
Kind of frightening in a hot way.

1330
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,520
Yeah.
Fox News

1331
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,590
has a bunch of those checks just 
waiting,

1332
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,940
waiting in the helm

1333
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:28,020
like that closet x market.
Now when the dude opens it up and sees,

1334
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:30,690
saw these robots with different skin and
faces,

1335
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:36,990
they have so many of them.
Just teleprompters ready to roll.

1336
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,873
Big,
big letters that they can read it 

1337
01:02:39,141 --> 01:02:39,740
clearly.

1338
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,300
We'll tell you what you like.
Yeah.

1339
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,550
They're making a movie and these three 
are the,

1340
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,860
uh,
the anchors on Fox News,

1341
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:48,080
Robbie,
Nicole Kidman,

1342
01:02:48,081 --> 01:02:50,150
and uh,
and Megan Kelly on.

1343
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,120
Yeah.

1344
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,370
Might be on the other end of the Porta 
potty.

1345
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,270
Dare you see.
You could get fired for that.

1346
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:00,343
Imagine if you were on a show and you 
said that that would be the end like 

1347
01:03:03,141 --> 01:03:05,390
that.
This is a beautiful thing about podcast.

1348
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:10,040
Nobody gives a fuck that you said that 
it has zero consequences.

1349
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,970
But like,
let's,

1350
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:11,803
let's pretend that you were on the 
tonight show and you were a guest and 

1351
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,200
you'll be in the end of that port.
A potty people.

1352
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:20,160
Oh,
did he really?

1353
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,123
Really?
That one was just trying to go to the 

1354
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:28,630
restroom.
You think that's funny?

1355
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:30,500
It's crazy.
What's happening.

1356
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,423
It's crazy.
I've noticed it a little bit and stand 

1357
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:34,574
up lately.
There's been a couple of these road 

1358
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:36,884
trips.
I did something that you told me not to 

1359
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:39,170
do.
Joe Rogan.

1360
01:03:39,171 --> 01:03:40,004
You ready for this?
You told me not to do it years ago when 

1361
01:03:42,021 --> 01:03:42,854
I did it and it was rough and I 
performed stand up comedy in 

1362
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:48,344
Connecticut.

1363
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:51,990
Is that right?

1364
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,300
You were right,
dude.

1365
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:58,390
I told you you your place of despair.
It's really crazy.

1366
01:03:58,850 --> 01:03:59,683
So one of the things that happened was,
is I noticed this really cool old guy 

1367
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:06,860
stood out in the front,
middle of the audience.

1368
01:04:06,861 --> 01:04:07,670
Right?
And I'm like,

1369
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,960
you seem like at a place and cool as 
hell and oldest.

1370
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,230
Fuck,
what's your story,

1371
01:04:12,231 --> 01:04:13,100
dude?
Right.

1372
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,353
And I noticed that there's this angry 
older lady almost like almost like Dana 

1373
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:18,944
carvey church lady character sitting 
next to him and I go and who's this 

1374
01:04:23,301 --> 01:04:28,301
angry lady that you're sitting next to?
She doesn't want to be here at all.

1375
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:30,470
And he goes,
that's my wife.

1376
01:04:30,471 --> 01:04:35,120
And they were the most different seeming
couple you could ever imagine.

1377
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,610
This happy,
smiling,

1378
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,870
laughing and everything guy in just 
this.

1379
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,310
I mean she was looking at me with hate,
not just not having fun.

1380
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:44,240
She hated me.

1381
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,420
It could have been something that I 
talked about early on.

1382
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:49,850
Maybe it was like a.
something about your Amy Schumer,

1383
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:52,520
Joe could have been,
that could have been my me to Joe,

1384
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,020
could have been my,
uh,

1385
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:58,010
trump misdirect joke that people,
you know what I mean anyway.

1386
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,713
And,
but I noticed next to them there's this 

1387
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:07,390
girl who seems even angrier than the mom
and they're the only two angry people in

1388
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,404
the room and it's a Gig at a casino in 
Connecticut and give me a face just 

1389
01:05:13,131 --> 01:05:16,400
literally like literally like a modern 
day,

1390
01:05:16,401 --> 01:05:19,940
like if said to a bad actress,
like play angry,

1391
01:05:19,941 --> 01:05:20,774
play angry,
angrier and angrier to a horrible 

1392
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:27,580
actress like that.
And uh,

1393
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,340
and,
and I go and I go,

1394
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:31,650
what's the problem?
And you know,

1395
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:36,740
there's like the,
I ignore it for like 45 minutes,

1396
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:38,560
right?
And I'm going on and on.

1397
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:39,640
But the mom's angry.

1398
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,110
It turns out that the chick next to 
them's the daughter and the.

1399
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,220
And they're basically mad because of 
whatever,

1400
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:46,054
whatever material or whatever.
And I ended up towards the end of my 

1401
01:05:49,141 --> 01:05:51,430
[inaudible] going off on the girl.
I go,

1402
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:55,050
Hey,
I go take this scowl on your face.

1403
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:58,990
What are you doing?
Do you think that's going to affect me,

1404
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,780
lady,
I'm getting paid the same amount whether

1405
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:06,520
you laugh or not and I'm back.
Dell lay back to the dream tomorrow.

1406
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:08,230
You know what I mean?
Like at this point I'm just,

1407
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,333
my fans are loving it and they're the 
ones that stumbled into the wrong scene 

1408
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:14,163
over the wrong show at the wrong time.
If they were looking for Christian 

1409
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:19,960
puppet comedy or whatever,
and I said to her,

1410
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,040
I go,
you seem like A.

1411
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:25,180
I go,
I go,

1412
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:30,480
you seem like an Internet troll that 
just stumbled in here like you seem like

1413
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:32,110
you're gonna write about this.

1414
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:32,943
You seem like the type of angry where 
you think you're gonna change something 

1415
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,580
or you're going to do something to my 
career.

1416
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,340
That's what I.
that's the Vibe I get from you.

1417
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,860
I literally made the jokes,
the crowds loving it by the way.

1418
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,083
You know what I mean?
Because they can tell like it's not 

1419
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,700
anything to you or is she just.
There was wondering.

1420
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,400
There was one part where I go,
I go Mike,

1421
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,250
because my goal,
the thing that,

1422
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,940
the reason why I ignored them for a 
while was because I go,

1423
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,090
you seem like a tough lady to the mom.
Right?

1424
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,260
I go,
you seem tough,

1425
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:05,860
but I'm going to break you at some point
during this set and when I do,

1426
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,810
I'm going to make sure this whole room 
knows.

1427
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:08,644
I'm going to say I gotcha.
And I'm not going to tell you when it's 

1428
01:07:11,021 --> 01:07:14,080
gonna happen,
but I'm going to make you laugh anyway.

1429
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:14,943
Forty five minutes later I get to the 
point to where I had in my mind set up 

1430
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:20,374
that there's no way she's not going to 
laugh at this and sure enough I got a 

1431
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:24,910
big smile out of her.
Right?

1432
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,670
I'm not,
I won't say what the joke is.

1433
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:28,504
I don't want to give anything away,
but I got the smile and I'm literally 

1434
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:31,714
like.
And the whole crowd's already laughing 

1435
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:34,204
and they can tell that I'm looking to 
watch to see if the lady breaks and she 

1436
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:39,220
doesn't.
And I go,

1437
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:42,120
how in the.
I thought I was gonna get ya.

1438
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:44,830
I thought I was gonna get shot.
That one.

1439
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:47,770
How is it possible that you don't laugh 
at that?

1440
01:07:47,771 --> 01:07:52,750
Like what do you do for Fun Lady?
Like at this point I'm just all amped up

1441
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,990
and I go,
what would I have to do to possibly make

1442
01:07:55,991 --> 01:07:56,770
you laugh?

1443
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,080
And that's finally when the angry 
daughter goes,

1444
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,570
be funny.
I go,

1445
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:06,630
oh no,
I've been killing for 52 minutes now.

1446
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:08,950
You know what I mean?
Like at this point,

1447
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:10,770
whatever.
There's everybody else,

1448
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,210
the 99 point nine percent of the other 
audiences,

1449
01:08:13,211 --> 01:08:16,310
the witness at this point in there 
against this chick,

1450
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:17,144
right?
Because this chick's now just mad 

1451
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:21,290
because whatever,
and,

1452
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:22,723
and I go,
you seem like the type of girl that 

1453
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:28,190
thinks that you can even affect an 
artist.

1454
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,053
You know what I mean?
This is this little millennial nerdy 

1455
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:34,400
girl and sure enough,
sure enough,

1456
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:38,250
I go on twitter later that night,
they're the at,

1457
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,273
at Mohegan Sun.
You should not be promoting this 

1458
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,780
comedian,
Barbara,

1459
01:08:42,781 --> 01:08:43,614
Barbara.
Two days later my manager gets an email 

1460
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:47,901
and he's like,
dude,

1461
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:51,640
we got this email from some lady in 
Connecticut,

1462
01:08:51,641 --> 01:08:54,680
so meaner on stage.
I'm like,

1463
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,650
she wrote you a letter was like,
it's three paragraphs long.

1464
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,780
I'm like,
what is happening?

1465
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,263
Like I mean,
what is happening in this world where 

1466
01:09:03,171 --> 01:09:08,150
someone's taking the time to write a 
letter to my manager of all people.

1467
01:09:08,151 --> 01:09:10,700
Who by the way is the laughing at the 
whole thing.

1468
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:14,520
If you manage it,
dumped you for that like enough,

1469
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,533
right?
One audience member in Connecticut and 

1470
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,253
then hold the crowd.
Ninety nine percent thought you were 

1471
01:09:19,741 --> 01:09:20,940
funny,
but that's not good enough.

1472
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,140
Yeah.
I need 100 percent,

1473
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:26,430
but man,
you were right in Connecticut is weird.

1474
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,323
It's a weird place.
You could run into a person like that 

1475
01:09:29,971 --> 01:09:30,860
anywhere.
Yeah.

1476
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,760
I mean I've run into people like that at
the store.

1477
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:34,560
They sit in the front row with her,
arms crossed.

1478
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,720
You're going to run into people like 
that everywhere,

1479
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,080
but there's something about Connecticut 
where it's no real cities.

1480
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,513
You've got Hartford,
which is a land of despair and you've 

1481
01:09:43,431 --> 01:09:44,264
got new haven which is worse and it's 
just a highway between Boston and New 

1482
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,520
York,
so all it is the Boston's great.

1483
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,770
New York's great.
Connecticut's like,

1484
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,780
what the fuck are you doing here?
What's going on here?

1485
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:57,960
It's become such a running joke that lex
Friedman,

1486
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:58,823
the scientists from Mit who's on here 
the other day to talk about artificial 

1487
01:10:01,051 --> 01:10:03,180
intelligence.
He brought it up as a joke.

1488
01:10:03,181 --> 01:10:04,014
What did he say?
You remember what he said something 

1489
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:08,160
about like he just wanted you to shit on
it.

1490
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,020
I don't remember exactly what I did.
I did so many gigs in Connecticut,

1491
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:17,190
so many,
so many because I lived in Boston and it

1492
01:10:17,191 --> 01:10:19,800
was like an hour and a half drive to our
drive.

1493
01:10:19,801 --> 01:10:22,340
You're in Connecticut.
We did a lot of gigs there.

1494
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,183
Greg Fitzsimmons and I,
we did a shit ton of gigs in 

1495
01:10:24,901 --> 01:10:26,550
Connecticut.
We'd always leave going.

1496
01:10:26,551 --> 01:10:29,310
What the fuck was that?

1497
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,750
It was felt.
It felt dirty.

1498
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,180
It's a Gig I did purely for the money.

1499
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:37,470
Some of them are good and my good friend
Tommy Junior lives in Connecticut.

1500
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:41,520
There's good people in Connecticut.
Sun All bad,

1501
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,760
but it's disproportionately bad.
That's the problem.

1502
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:47,550
It's not that everyone in Connecticut is
full of despair.

1503
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:52,050
No means a lot of people that live in 
Hartford and not Hartford,

1504
01:10:52,051 --> 01:10:56,250
but what's that area outside of New York
City where all the rich people live?

1505
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,590
Greenwich.
That's where Vince Mcmahon Lips.

1506
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,510
Super Rich.
Like estates?

1507
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:01,363
Yeah.
Like David Letterman has a spot out 

1508
01:11:03,391 --> 01:11:05,820
there.
I mean like you got to drive like a mile

1509
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:08,070
to get to the property down their 
driveway.

1510
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,950
The driveway was like a mile of like 
manicured lawns.

1511
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,590
They have those great gatsby type 
residence there.

1512
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,660
Hell yeah.
A lot of pills.

1513
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,730
A lot of people pilled up.
Yeah.

1514
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,200
Look at these joints is the average 
house.

1515
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,990
Wow.
Look at these joints.

1516
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,790
That's not real,
but it's being built.

1517
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:26,320
Dam.
Those are the apartment buildings,

1518
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,950
but it's a house.
Let me see a house.

1519
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:29,970
See,
that's a house.

1520
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:35,240
That's a Connecticut House dude.
There's insane amounts of finance money.

1521
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,270
Like that's great.
Gatsby type shit.

1522
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,600
Did you ever read the Great Gatsby?
I uh,

1523
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:42,434
I watched the movie.
I was supposed to read the book as a 

1524
01:11:44,751 --> 01:11:47,540
student.
The dicaprio movies actually.

1525
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:48,650
Pretty fucking good.
Yeah.

1526
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,210
Really good.
Great Soundtrack.

1527
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,220
Yeah.
And it was weird too,

1528
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:53,054
because it's like they took artistic 
license with like the way the 

1529
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:56,354
automobiles worked and moved and there 
was like a lot of flair to it that made 

1530
01:11:59,571 --> 01:12:01,340
it exciting.
Beautiful movie.

1531
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,530
One of those ones where you got to turn 
out the lights,

1532
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:06,320
make sure your color on your tvs right 
and turn up the sound.

1533
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

1534
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:08,503
But that's that area.
That area of Connecticut is just 

1535
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:15,080
unbelievably wealthy.
That area of Connecticut.

1536
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:18,320
And there's another area that's similar 
to that in Long Island.

1537
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,453
Like that's the Hamptons.
The hamptons in Long Island is all just 

1538
01:12:22,101 --> 01:12:22,934
insane wealth.
Just like Matt Lauer has a house out 

1539
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:31,040
there that's like $16,000,000
on the today show money.

1540
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:33,600
Holla,
man.

1541
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:35,780
He's doing it.
He's not.

1542
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,470
What is he going to do?
We think they're good.

1543
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:40,320
I can make a comeback.
Ah,

1544
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,530
I think.
No,

1545
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:42,790
I think.
No,

1546
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:46,210
I think he's gonna be like selling 
things any day now.

1547
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,253
Like how like Larry King now like sells 
things like on late night tv ever see 

1548
01:12:51,221 --> 01:12:52,054
that?
Was he selling Larry King's like sling 

1549
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:58,300
and like fake products and stuff.
They're Kingston's a show,

1550
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,333
sort of a mixture of an advertisement.
Is a show on television or is it on the 

1551
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:04,974
Internet?
I think it's on the Internet and it was 

1552
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:08,960
just on it.

1553
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:10,580
Really?
Yeah.

1554
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,710
I'm talking about they know what you're 
talking about.

1555
01:13:13,711 --> 01:13:17,400
The TV that looks like a TV show,
but it's for them not a TV show.

1556
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:18,234
It's really just a.
he's like asking questions like he used 

1557
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:22,470
to do,
but it's just some guy like.

1558
01:13:22,471 --> 01:13:23,304
Yes.
And another thing might prostate 

1559
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:25,620
medicine can do.
Oh,

1560
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,401
right,
right,

1561
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,540
right.
It's on the same set.

1562
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:28,530
That's why I'm saying that.
I guess.

1563
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:30,750
Here's the set of his show.
It's on aura tv,

1564
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:34,980
but he shoots those commercials on that 
wooden background said,

1565
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,450
oh,
okay.

1566
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:37,284
So they just have a similar setup.
Who's that girl in the upper right hand 

1567
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:42,810
corner?
What is that?

1568
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,220
What is that trick?
Seem to.

1569
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,900
What in the hell am I?
Watch drag queen.

1570
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,930
What?
Go go full screen please.

1571
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,940
Oh,
look at her eyes.

1572
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:59,840
That's insane.
Oh Shit.

1573
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:02,580
What's going on there with the eyes?
I'm confused.

1574
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,420
Lots of tents.
Makeup and.

1575
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:08,040
But wait a minute,
I don't know where her actual eyes.

1576
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,030
Somewhere in there.
Whoa.

1577
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,360
That's a drag queen.
It's like,

1578
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:13,403
oh,
it's Kinda like she's like a true on 

1579
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,513
extra lashes or something.
But she also drew white underneath the 

1580
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:19,390
eyes.
There you go.

1581
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,490
And then black.
Oh my God.

1582
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:22,324
That's insanity.
Those the craziest eyes have ever seen 

1583
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:27,280
in my life.
Eyebrows going away.

1584
01:14:27,281 --> 01:14:27,971
Up.
Yeah.

1585
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:28,804
Well the,
the black triangles in the corners of 

1586
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:35,270
the eyes to that is the nuttiest makeup 
and look at the cheekbones,

1587
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,153
like how sculpted it is,
where it's like it has an abrupt line 

1588
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:39,783
before the lower jaw.
Like a spray painted with the same 

1589
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:43,570
person.
That's crazy.

1590
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:45,280
Larry King's was trying to play it.
Cool.

1591
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,173
He can't even tell he's blind.
He doesn't even know he's looking at 

1592
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,460
yellow.
Great makeup.

1593
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,790
Lovely.
So how long have you been at man?

1594
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:55,683
I'm a woman.

1595
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:59,590
I've always been a woman.
Oh Yeah?

1596
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,910
Yeah.
I forgot.

1597
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,470
He's born in the 19 hundreds.
Men who didn't know shit back then.

1598
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:07,840
Larry King's washed it all happened,
man.

1599
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,590
Dude.
Larry King went to the pokey pokey.

1600
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:14,170
The jail.
Larry King went to jail.

1601
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:15,670
Yeah,
there she is.

1602
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,530
Slow.
Whoa,

1603
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:19,480
look at that makeup man.
God,

1604
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,370
she looks like a pink floyd album 
covers.

1605
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,240
How is that even real?
But she's got a signature look though.

1606
01:15:25,241 --> 01:15:26,320
I'll tell you that.
That's her.

1607
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:28,210
Look,
she wears all these pictures.

1608
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:31,150
Have that triangle thing.
I'm scared to have her in here.

1609
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,250
What does she look like without makeup?
Right there?

1610
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:35,220
What does she live?
What do you think she looks like?

1611
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:39,010
Probably like me.
Probably better looking than you.

1612
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,830
Maybe look into the camera.
Tony.

1613
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,063
I'm sorry.

1614
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,380
Yeah,
maybe a picture me with cat eyes.

1615
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,170
Not Cat eyes.
That was a cat.

1616
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:54,020
I'd shoot it right in the fucking head.
Has An evil cat.

1617
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,280
Um,
what did Larry King go to jail for?

1618
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,960
Went to jail for something that's crazy.
Uh,

1619
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,640
like it looks like he's all coked up in 
his mugshot photo.

1620
01:16:04,641 --> 01:16:06,620
It looks like a wild man.
Grand Larceny.

1621
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:08,030
Oh Damn.
Yeah.

1622
01:16:08,031 --> 01:16:10,670
Look at him.
What is the grand larceny bad?

1623
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:12,373
I like money laundering.
Larry King was into some ozone shit 

1624
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:21,980
cooked out of his mind.
Look at my fucking Miami whores whores.

1625
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:27,020
They had a common sideburns.
It looks fucking amazing.

1626
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:29,450
Nineteen 71.
Wow.

1627
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,760
Yeah,
Dude.

1628
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,950
I was four years old.
Larry King's getting arrested.

1629
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,520
Damn.
Find out what he got arrested for.

1630
01:16:37,521 --> 01:16:40,120
What did he do on able to pay back money
he owns?

1631
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,170
Oh,
that's it.

1632
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,330
Oh,
he owed a finance here.

1633
01:16:44,331 --> 01:16:47,660
He was doing some work for the judge to 
route the larceny charge because statute

1634
01:16:47,661 --> 01:16:48,494
of limitation run out.
King pled no contest to one count of 

1635
01:16:50,901 --> 01:16:54,410
passing bad checks.
It's not that bad.

1636
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,180
Dade County,
Florida,

1637
01:16:56,181 --> 01:16:58,100
that shirt is by the way like they 
don't.

1638
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:00,080
They just don't make shirts like that.
Look,

1639
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:03,320
that's just white circles on a black 
collared shirt.

1640
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:05,180
You can get those from me.
Undies.

1641
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:10,090
Your Polo shirts like that does

1642
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,260
me?
Andy's do shirts.

1643
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,410
They do.
Wow.

1644
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,970
Yeah.
Damn.

1645
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,240
Yeah.
They have lounge pants now and let's.

1646
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:21,290
What's the Promo Code?
I wrote me undies.com.

1647
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:23,760
Forward Slash rogen.
Love it.

1648
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,240
Everybody was doing coke back then.
I got assumed Larry King was on coke.

1649
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,950
You've seen cocaine cowboys,
right?

1650
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,620
Yeah.
Fucking amazing.

1651
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,060
Amazing.
Amazing.

1652
01:17:35,061 --> 01:17:40,061
Document one into amazing.
When you just realize what you could be,

1653
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:41,203
especially if you're living in Ohio,
like you were or out here in Los 

1654
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,793
Angeles,
you might not know the history of 

1655
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,224
cocaine in Miami.
He might not know how fucking insane it 

1656
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:54,260
was until you watch that documentary and
you just go,

1657
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:55,420
what?
Yeah,

1658
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,940
or Narcos or really,
you know,

1659
01:17:58,970 --> 01:17:59,803
narcos is good,
but it's a lot of it is about another 

1660
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:02,234
country.
Yeah.

1661
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,510
Like cocaine.
Cowboys is almost all about America.

1662
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,340
Yeah.
There's one,

1663
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,430
one part of cooking cowboys that I'll 
never forget what they said,

1664
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,264
that the entire graduating class of the 
police academy was either murdered or 

1665
01:18:16,131 --> 01:18:17,030
went to jail.

1666
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:20,683
Wow.

1667
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,740
They were all corrupt.
Everybody was doing coke.

1668
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,820
There's more banks per capita in Miami 
at least at the time,

1669
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:32,070
than anywhere else in the country,
and it was all money laundering saw.

1670
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:32,943
It was fucking hell.
My friend Steve Graham was going to 

1671
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:41,060
school in Miami back then.
He was doing his residency in Miami.

1672
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:46,300
He's an ophthalmologist and he was there
during the cocaine violence hears.

1673
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,150
So he was doing his residency.
You do emergency room work.

1674
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:51,403
So he was there,
people bullet holes and fucking brain's 

1675
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,360
exploded.
He said it was crazy.

1676
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:57,194
The amount of violence.
He would say just every night people 

1677
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,433
would bullet holes and gunshot wounds 
and knife wounds and fucking attacked 

1678
01:19:03,971 --> 01:19:08,971
with barb wire and chaos and a lot of 
people with things up their ass.

1679
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,990
Railey oh yeah.
All kinds of things.

1680
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:15,720
Light Bulbs.
You know those twisty light bulbs like a

1681
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:18,470
pine cone up the ass.
Can't get it out.

1682
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:22,250
Why would a,
why wouldn't they?

1683
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:26,390
Why light bulbs warm a little bit up.
Shove it in there.

1684
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,283
Start beating off.
Can't get it out there to get to the 

1685
01:19:29,871 --> 01:19:32,480
doctor.
How do you drive slow.

1686
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:33,314
I'll put my ass out.

1687
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,303
No,

1688
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,553
I don't know.
But he told me that that was one of the 

1689
01:19:38,461 --> 01:19:39,870
things.
They pulled out a guy's ass.

1690
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:42,660
A light bulb.
One of them twisty light bulbs.

1691
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:43,780
That's,
that's the thing too.

1692
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,510
Like Gi Joe Dolls.
She liked that.

1693
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:47,220
That's what happens when you have a bad 
idea.

1694
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,113
A light bulb appears

1695
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:51,540
in your ass instead of over your head.

1696
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:00,090
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1697
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:04,320
That would be actually really fun.
A really fun thing in a movie,

1698
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:07,260
you know,
like a cartoon.

1699
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:13,030
I've got a great idea.
I know.

1700
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,930
Oh my God,
thank God we're not Dr.

1701
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,730
so yeah,
seriously,

1702
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:24,703
you know,
how morose you would get your everyday 

1703
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:30,450
you're dealing with people dying.
They just get too comfortable with it

1704
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,160
and you have to save them no matter 
what.

1705
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,990
I was reading last night about the,
uh,

1706
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:34,824
about the uh,
Jewish doctor who had the shooter of 

1707
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:41,490
the,
of the temple in Pittsburgh.

1708
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:45,720
He had to save his life.
He had to like make sure that he's okay.

1709
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:46,703
You know what I mean?
Sometimes you're just helping horrible 

1710
01:20:48,841 --> 01:20:52,620
human beings that just slaughtered some 
of your own people.

1711
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:55,890
Now you're a Jewish doctor.
Happened to fix the guy.

1712
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:59,550
Now in our World Tarantino world,
we like to think that,

1713
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,050
oh,
oh,

1714
01:21:01,051 --> 01:21:03,060
so sorry to accidentally,
oh,

1715
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:05,850
it appears as if though I haven't given 
you the right medicine.

1716
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:06,684
You know what I mean?
But in real life they have to just 

1717
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:09,960
stitch them up and

1718
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,680
you know,
well,

1719
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:12,593
it also mean that guy probably has a 
record is in terms of what is success 

1720
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:17,634
ratio.
He doesn't want to fuck it up for some 

1721
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:19,560
asshole.
Right?

1722
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:22,963
Oh yeah.
It seems like being a doctor would be 

1723
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:27,180
very,
very hard.

1724
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:28,103
Like as a mentally it seems like racking
up those losses and such a lack of 

1725
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:34,860
control.
The human body,

1726
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,670
emt workers to.
Yeah,

1727
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,940
same kind of deal.
A buddy of mine told me,

1728
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,790
I'm never date a female emt worker.
I go,

1729
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:43,050
why?
And he goes,

1730
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:44,970
they're crazy.
He goes,

1731
01:21:44,971 --> 01:21:47,130
they've seen so much violence.
They just fuck everyone.

1732
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,050
I go,
what?

1733
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:48,571
And he goes,
yeah,

1734
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:51,750
this is a bunch of female emt workers 
that they work with.

1735
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:52,853
They're just bang everybody.
Obviously it's not every emt female 

1736
01:21:55,621 --> 01:22:00,621
worker because he's just my asshole 
friend telling me this based on his very

1737
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:01,794
limited polling,
but my thought on it is to you imagine 

1738
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:09,210
how fleeting you would feel that life 
is.

1739
01:22:09,211 --> 01:22:10,044
If every day you're seeing people die 
everyday you're dealing with car 

1740
01:22:12,211 --> 01:22:13,100
accidents,
you're showing up.

1741
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,880
People's brains are splattered all over 
the highway.

1742
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:15,923
Their legs are ripped off.
They've been run over by trucks every 

1743
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:19,050
day,
all day long.

1744
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:20,790
And this was what he.
He said,

1745
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,650
he goes,
he goes,

1746
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,513
first of all,
no one's supposed to see that much 

1747
01:22:25,171 --> 01:22:25,860
death.

1748
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:27,180
He goes,
if you see that much death,

1749
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,730
it rewires the way your brain works.
He goes,

1750
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:33,210
you're supposed to see that.
Supposed to see that.

1751
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:35,310
Very rarely,
very rarely in life.

1752
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:38,370
We see it every day.
It's like something goes wrong,

1753
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:39,503
and he goes,
it's been my experience that some of 

1754
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:44,150
these women with that goes wrong.
They just,

1755
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,960
they're just wild.
That is,

1756
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,880
fuck everybody,
God.

1757
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:48,810
I go,
Whoa,

1758
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:49,643
but why do you think they're doing it?
And he's like too distracting 

1759
01:22:51,121 --> 01:22:51,954
themselves,
trying to distract themselves from the 

1760
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:55,020
violence.
Again,

1761
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,780
this is one asshole friend if you're 
listening to like,

1762
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,410
Fuck Tony Hinchcliffe and Joe Rogan.
I can't believe you brought that up.

1763
01:23:01,411 --> 01:23:02,880
I'm an emt worker.
I'm a mom.

1764
01:23:02,881 --> 01:23:04,620
I'm a great person.
I'm sure you are ma'am.

1765
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,300
I'm talking about the east

1766
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:10,090
to fuck like an animal and you know it.
That's how those babies were made.

1767
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,660
Wow.
How dare you hit that.

1768
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:18,680
It seems to make sense to me that female
emt would be a pretty horned up cops to.

1769
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:21,730
Oh,
for sure.

1770
01:23:21,731 --> 01:23:22,880
Cops.
Yeah.

1771
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:25,060
Yeah.
I watched a porno the other day,

1772
01:23:25,061 --> 01:23:27,820
two female cops getting banged by the 
black guy.

1773
01:23:27,821 --> 01:23:30,150
They were supposed to arrest.
Of course that happens.

1774
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:34,690
It must happen.
Happens with guards in jail.

1775
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,900
Female guards.
Remember those guys that escaped?

1776
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,240
One of them was banging the guard and 
upstate New York.

1777
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,480
They flew to fleet to Canada.
Some fugly looking female guard dude was

1778
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:50,080
throwing dicker way.
The guard left with the prisoner.

1779
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:54,460
Didn't she bring him the stuff to help 
them break out?

1780
01:23:54,461 --> 01:23:57,040
Right and saw or something,
and then she turned herself in.

1781
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:58,740
She couldn't handle it anymore.

1782
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:01,820
Fucking ramp.
The alarms are going off in.

1783
01:24:01,821 --> 01:24:03,740
The manhunt was underway like,
how did he get out?

1784
01:24:03,741 --> 01:24:06,150
She's like,
oh wow.

1785
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,780
Imagine that you're a prisoner.
It is.

1786
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:13,363
Look at her.
Joyce Mitchell denied parole after 

1787
01:24:17,211 --> 01:24:20,180
helping killer inmates escaped New York 
prison.

1788
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:21,740
Going to jail herself.

1789
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:25,150
That's the look of a lady that messed up
after getting good Dick.

1790
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:26,680
There was a guy I used to spar with

1791
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:31,030
who was a security guard at jail and 
that was fucking with his head too.

1792
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:34,990
He was just telling me about what the 
experience was like.

1793
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:35,824
Like every day you're just always 
dealing with these fucking people that 

1794
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:41,663
they're never getting out of there.
Like he was in a maximum security 

1795
01:24:43,961 --> 01:24:44,794
penitentiary,
so like they're never getting out of 

1796
01:24:45,911 --> 01:24:46,744
there every day.
Every day you're just dealing with 

1797
01:24:48,731 --> 01:24:52,570
horrible people in terrible 
circumstances and they know that you get

1798
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:54,550
to leave.
They know you get to leave,

1799
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:57,910
but you're living with them.
Most of the day goes,

1800
01:24:57,911 --> 01:24:59,020
yeah,
I'm not a prisoner.

1801
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:00,363
He goes,
but my environment is surrounded by 

1802
01:25:03,491 --> 01:25:05,040
these people.
He's like,

1803
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,730
that affects you.
It's like,

1804
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:09,190
I never thought about it that way.
I always thought the guards have it.

1805
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:10,660
Okay.
It's just a job.

1806
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:11,733
Whereas the inmates,
you know well those poor bastards are 

1807
01:25:13,421 --> 01:25:16,180
stuck in there while you're in there 
with them for eight hours a day.

1808
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,720
Most of the time you're not controlling 
them most of the time.

1809
01:25:19,721 --> 01:25:20,950
You just coexisting.

1810
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:23,940
Yeah.
Who's behind the bars?

1811
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,710
Which,
which way is behind?

1812
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:26,583
Right?
Right there in a cell with a hallway 

1813
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:30,390
filled with bars.
People,

1814
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:32,070
one person on the other side of each 
bar.

1815
01:25:32,071 --> 01:25:32,904
So are they the same exact thing and 
then they're wearing body armor and 

1816
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:37,164
fucking they have clubs and they always 
terrified that a riot is going to break 

1817
01:25:39,391 --> 01:25:41,580
out.
You saw Whitey bulger got killed.

1818
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:42,720
He did,
yeah.

1819
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:45,770
When?
Yesterday in prison sentence for them.

1820
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:49,170
And like first day,
first day hold that guy,

1821
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:54,320
that guy that hates rats killed him in 
Italian guy or like a gangster guy.

1822
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:57,720
Really?
That guy I read,

1823
01:25:57,721 --> 01:25:58,554
the guy,
uh,

1824
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:03,000
is obsessed with hating rats and hating 
people that beat.

1825
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,800
And I guess Whitey killed women.
This guy,

1826
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:08,600
the first chance he got

1827
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:09,903
Whitey Bulger,
met a violent end after a lifetime of 

1828
01:26:12,671 --> 01:26:14,180
brutality.
They,

1829
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:17,360
they tried to pull his eyes out of his 
skull.

1830
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,433
Whoa.
I don't know if they were successful or 

1831
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:20,890
not.
The thing I read

1832
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,170
didn't make it larger so I could read 
that.

1833
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,680
And what does it say in a three foot 
grave near a river,

1834
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:28,740
not far from Boston,
Pat mcgonigal's body laid,

1835
01:26:28,741 --> 01:26:31,500
decaying,
undisturbed until his remains were found

1836
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:33,870
20 years later,
part of his pelvic bone,

1837
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,430
fractured skull and decompose brain 
matter or bringing,

1838
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,101
oh,
okay.

1839
01:26:38,101 --> 01:26:40,830
This is all the different things that 
he's done.

1840
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:42,420
Yeah,
yeah.

1841
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,990
Now he was a horrible fucking killer.
West Virginia.

1842
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:47,370
After he transferred,
you know,

1843
01:26:47,371 --> 01:26:51,770
I used to train a guy that was one of 
his fucking mom,

1844
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:54,510
henchmen guy said to me once,
he goes,

1845
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:58,560
if you're going to kill somebody,
how would you kill him as a with my bare

1846
01:26:58,561 --> 01:26:59,281
hands?
He goes,

1847
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:00,114
yeah,
I go,

1848
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,740
I probably hit him in the neck.
Was like,

1849
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:04,770
yeah.
I was like,

1850
01:27:04,771 --> 01:27:05,570
okay.

1851
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:10,340
That was scary until you find out that's
the end of the conversation.

1852
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:14,940
I was 19 at the time when I was teaching
taekwondo,

1853
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:17,470
when I was teaching this guy who,
um,

1854
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:18,563
he was friends with a friend of mine who
absolutely worked for Whitey Bulger who 

1855
01:27:24,991 --> 01:27:26,190
wound up going to jail.

1856
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:31,430
And they told me that this guy used to 
whack people.

1857
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:33,920
I was like,
oh Jesus Christ.

1858
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:38,480
And I was teaching him type window.
He was very serious,

1859
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,273
like a WHO's very intense.
And I was very aware that there was 

1860
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:46,940
something different about him and it 
goes very aware,

1861
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:47,783
like he wasn't just a guy that was 
learning for exercise or self defense 

1862
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,170
want to take a little class,
is learn a little martial arts.

1863
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:59,360
He was gonna use it like he was a guy 
that was in case he needed to use it.

1864
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:01,190
You know what I'm saying?
Like there's,

1865
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:04,880
there's a mindset of someone who just 
wants to get better at a martial art and

1866
01:28:04,881 --> 01:28:06,440
there's a mindset of someone who's 
thinking about,

1867
01:28:06,441 --> 01:28:07,820
okay,
it's going to come down.

1868
01:28:07,821 --> 01:28:09,590
I'm going to fuck him right there.
Okay.

1869
01:28:09,591 --> 01:28:12,260
And I'm going to kill that guy.
Was like,

1870
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:13,730
when he would practice,
there was a,

1871
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:17,990
there was a certain amount of focus and 
intensity that he had.

1872
01:28:17,991 --> 01:28:20,600
That was palpable.
Yeah.

1873
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:23,280
Mobsters need to get better at,
uh,

1874
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:25,000
at that type of stuff.
Do you ever see,

1875
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:27,550
remember Deniros kicks in?
Goodfellas.

1876
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:30,860
Those just sloppy this straight down the
middle.

1877
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:34,580
What's this?
Why do you boulders fader that did it?

1878
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:37,140
Yeah.
He was unrecognizable less ago.

1879
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,020
Did it?
Bam.

1880
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,120
Right.
Mr.

1881
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:43,400
Bulges eyes appeared to have been 
dislodged from his head.

1882
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:44,643
Although it was unclear whether his 
attackers gouged them out or they were 

1883
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:49,880
knocked out because he was beaten so 
severely in the attack.

1884
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,433
This information was relayed by senior 
law enforcement official who oversees 

1885
01:28:55,251 --> 01:28:56,690
organized crime cases.

1886
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:58,630
Oh,
that's what it was.

1887
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,950
It was a padlock stuffed.
A sock.

1888
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:03,810
Oh,
that's what they beat them with.

1889
01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:06,600
Yup.
And they also pulled his eyes out of his

1890
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:09,060
head,
at least in part with a padlock that was

1891
01:29:09,061 --> 01:29:09,894
stuffed inside of us suck.
At least two inmates were quickly sent 

1892
01:29:12,631 --> 01:29:13,464
to solitary confinement after Mr Bolger 
was found according to three employees 

1893
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:20,160
of the Federal Bureau of prisons.
Wow.

1894
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,253
Damn.
Yeah.

1895
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:24,420
Well,
couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

1896
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:30,120
Whitey bulger.
Do you know he won the lottery twice?

1897
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:31,610
Really?
Yup.

1898
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:36,260
Not really a scam.
I mean,

1899
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:37,560
that was,
that was how he,

1900
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:41,460
um,
he would show his income so someone else

1901
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:42,294
would win the lottery and they would 
come to him and he would like give them 

1902
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:46,860
the money and they would give them a 
lottery ticket and he'd be like,

1903
01:29:46,861 --> 01:29:48,150
look,
I won the lottery.

1904
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,610
That's how I'm rich.
Yeah.

1905
01:29:53,450 --> 01:29:54,283
Yeah.
It dark like they probably would find 

1906
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:57,900
the person who won the lottery,
you know,

1907
01:29:57,901 --> 01:29:59,370
they chase Dana white out of town.

1908
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,040
Do you know that?
No.

1909
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:02,280
Yeah,
yeah,

1910
01:30:02,281 --> 01:30:03,180
they,
they wanted money.

1911
01:30:03,181 --> 01:30:05,760
They wanted payment from Dan and white 
and uh,

1912
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:06,893
Dana White got beaten up by them so 
severely that he had tinnitus in his 

1913
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:11,690
ears.
Fuck yeah.

1914
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:13,740
He had a fucking.
He had a jet out of town.

1915
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:16,080
He moved to Vegas.
Wow.

1916
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,600
Yeah,
because they want her to cut of the UFC.

1917
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,010
No,
it wasn't the UFC.

1918
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,740
There was no ufc back then.
He was like a boxing trainer.

1919
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:25,050
Oh,
I forget what he was doing,

1920
01:30:25,051 --> 01:30:25,884
whether he's running a gym,
but he had to leave town because the 

1921
01:30:29,491 --> 01:30:31,140
mom.
That's why he left Boston.

1922
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,270
Yeah,
it was real man.

1923
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,480
I mean this was all when I was a kid.
I mean I got seriously into taekwondo in

1924
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:46,551
1982.
That's when it became like 81,

1925
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:47,634
82.
That's when it really became like my 

1926
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:49,254
whole life.
And that's right around the time where 

1927
01:30:51,721 --> 01:30:53,070
all that shit was going on.

1928
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,640
And then when in 1988,
I became friends with a comedian who was

1929
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:05,970
his brother went to jail for being a 
part of Whitey bulger's mom.

1930
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,030
Yeah.
Crazy.

1931
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:10,223
Yeah.
It was like everybody knew somebody who 

1932
01:31:11,851 --> 01:31:14,940
was in some way connected to the mob in 
some way.

1933
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,640
You know,
I just.

1934
01:31:16,641 --> 01:31:17,430
One Dude,
one here,

1935
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:20,460
crazy story.
There's one guy,

1936
01:31:20,461 --> 01:31:21,680
he's dead now.
I could talk about him.

1937
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,490
His name is richie and he went to jail.
Um,

1938
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,513
while I knew him,
he was arrested for a murder that I 

1939
01:31:30,241 --> 01:31:31,074
don't think they ever got him on.
But this person who was killed wasn't 

1940
01:31:35,401 --> 01:31:39,600
just killed.
They broke every bone in his body with a

1941
01:31:39,601 --> 01:31:44,601
hammer and kept injecting him with 
cocaine to keep them awake.

1942
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:47,243
Yeah.
So he would black out from the pain and 

1943
01:31:49,861 --> 01:31:53,070
they would inject him with cocaine to 
wake them back up again.

1944
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,660
And then they would break another bone.

1945
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,670
They're breaking all of his bones with a
hammer.

1946
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:59,320
They cut his hands off,
cut his head off,

1947
01:31:59,321 --> 01:32:02,500
they cut everything off.
And then when they found,

1948
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:05,980
you know,
is broken heap of a body.

1949
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:06,963
He was somehow connected to this guy 
that I knew sold coke and this guy had 

1950
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:15,820
gone to jail and uh,
I knew him before he went to jail.

1951
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:19,540
He was another guy from taekwondo.
I knew him before he went to jail.

1952
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:21,730
He was one person.
He was a young guy.

1953
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:23,163
I was,
I think when he went to jail I was 16 

1954
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:30,510
and I think he was 20 and then when he 
got out of jail it was,

1955
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:36,450
I was 20 and he was 24 and he had scars 
all over his body where he tried to,

1956
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:40,390
uh,
like sand off his,

1957
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,553
his tattoos.
He had tattoos all over his arms and I 

1958
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:45,304
don't know what the tattoos were,
whether they were racist or whether he 

1959
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:48,783
just didn't want him anymore,
but he had like either acid burns or 

1960
01:32:51,521 --> 01:32:52,760
scars,
like what are,

1961
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:53,470
how are the fuck?

1962
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:55,630
He tried to get the tattoos all over his
arms.

1963
01:32:55,690 --> 01:33:00,690
His arms are covered in scars and he 
wasn't good.

1964
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,720
He wasn't like a,
a talented martial artists,

1965
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:05,823
but he was insanely tough,
like insanely aggressive and insanely 

1966
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:11,890
tough.
And when you sparred him,

1967
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,310
you were fighting for your life,
for your life.

1968
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,780
He would come at me and try to fucking 
kill me.

1969
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:20,643
I mean fucking kill you,
throwing looping punches with every 

1970
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:28,330
fucking ounce of his being.
And I'm moving around and I'm like,

1971
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,860
oh,
we're fighting to the death here.

1972
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:31,330
We're fighting.
This is not,

1973
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:34,720
this is not sparring.
We only spotted a couple of times before

1974
01:33:34,721 --> 01:33:37,600
this.
But one time he had me cornered.

1975
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:38,493
He trapped me in a corner and hit me 
with a fucking bomb on the top of my 

1976
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:44,160
head.
Just boom,

1977
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:44,994
like as hard as he could.
But he was a strong guy who's quite a 

1978
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:47,890
bit bigger than me to Irish guy.

1979
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:51,310
I think he was Italian.
Um,

1980
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:54,220
and uh,
I kicked him in the head so hard.

1981
01:33:54,221 --> 01:33:59,221
It broke his cheek,
like his cheek shifted over his face.

1982
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:00,634
I will kicked him.
So I hit him with my heel and his face 

1983
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:07,300
and he dropped down.
He collapsed,

1984
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:11,920
went down to is like,
like went down face first,

1985
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:14,920
got up on his all fours,
got back up again,

1986
01:34:14,921 --> 01:34:16,500
wanting to keep going.
And I said,

1987
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:17,380
I go,
Richie,

1988
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,940
I go,
you got to look in the mirror.

1989
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,320
I go,
come look in the mirror.

1990
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:22,540
And he's like,
oh fuck.

1991
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:23,201
I go,
yeah,

1992
01:34:23,201 --> 01:34:24,340
you can't spar anymore,
dude.

1993
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:26,260
He wanted to kill me.
He wanted to keep going.

1994
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:27,573
You want to keep going.
After I basically kicked his face in 

1995
01:34:29,591 --> 01:34:30,910
half.
Jesus,

1996
01:34:30,911 --> 01:34:33,640
I hit him so hard.
It wasn't a sparring session.

1997
01:34:33,641 --> 01:34:36,220
It was an I'm trying to kill you.
You're trying to kill me session.

1998
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:39,060
And I remember setting them upset and 
I'm upset and I'm up.

1999
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,190
And I hit him with that thing and he 
face planted.

2000
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:45,940
Most people would have just went out,
but he was so angry and so mean.

2001
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:48,520
He was trying to get up.
It's fucking scary.

2002
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:50,190
That was,
I was the last time I sparred with him,

2003
01:34:50,191 --> 01:34:51,160
I'm like,
we're not sparring anymore,

2004
01:34:51,161 --> 01:34:53,620
dude.
I'm not not fighting the death with some

2005
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,020
guy who I'm kind of friendly with.
I was friendly with them.

2006
01:34:56,021 --> 01:34:58,430
Other than that,
like what was you would never guess.

2007
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:00,163
Remember one time we went out,
it was me and him and these two girls 

2008
01:35:03,381 --> 01:35:04,700
and they were like real weird,
right?

2009
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:06,680
And uh,
you know,

2010
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:08,780
this one girl was like a,
you know,

2011
01:35:08,781 --> 01:35:10,700
like Richie,
when are we going to get that stuff?

2012
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,610
I go,
what stuff you're going to get in.

2013
01:35:12,611 --> 01:35:13,910
He's like a.
and she's like,

2014
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:15,920
he's going to get us some coke or you 
don't want a coke?

2015
01:35:15,921 --> 01:35:17,180
She goes,
fuck you.

2016
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,490
Trying to tell her she doesn't want 
coke.

2017
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,880
She's like,
that's why I'm here.

2018
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,950
That's why I'm hanging out with this 
guy.

2019
01:35:27,951 --> 01:35:29,840
Stupid.
That's so funny.

2020
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:30,973
Yeah,
it was one of the rare times I hung out 

2021
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:32,684
with them outside of the gym.
He told me a story about how he had a 

2022
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,064
fight off these guys with a broomstick 
in jail and now he's beaten these guys 

2023
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:45,980
to death with a broomstick.
Just this horrible story about him being

2024
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:46,814
forced to mop up something in a bathroom
and these guys cornered them and he's 

2025
01:35:50,241 --> 01:35:51,074
just fucking attacking them with this 
broomstick and about how you got extra 

2026
01:35:54,051 --> 01:35:54,890
time for that.

2027
01:35:57,580 --> 01:36:00,880
I forget what he went to jail for.
I assume it's probably drug related.

2028
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,553
I don't remember what it was,
but I remember just being so nervous 

2029
01:36:05,231 --> 01:36:07,810
about being connected to people like 
that,

2030
01:36:07,811 --> 01:36:11,620
like knowing people like that from the 
gym because there's people like that.

2031
01:36:11,621 --> 01:36:13,960
There were always there always wanted to
learn how to fight.

2032
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,300
So because you knew,
you know,

2033
01:36:16,301 --> 01:36:17,950
you're teaching martial arts,
you training,

2034
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:21,520
there's always those.
Those guys would always come in whenever

2035
01:36:21,521 --> 01:36:23,060
it was time to spar.
Oh,

2036
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:26,800
scary times.
There was no pulling back.

2037
01:36:26,801 --> 01:36:29,770
There was no,
like if you respond with some friends,

2038
01:36:29,771 --> 01:36:32,550
like I was sparring with like my friend 
Leroy Rodriguez,

2039
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:33,403
a good friend of mine who was fast as 
lightning is Puerto Rican guy was bad 

2040
01:36:35,681 --> 01:36:36,514
motherfucker.
But he would not hurt me when we would 

2041
01:36:38,341 --> 01:36:39,940
spar,
we would go hard,

2042
01:36:39,941 --> 01:36:42,920
but he would hold back from hurting you.
You know,

2043
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:46,180
you could trust certain people where you
were sparring.

2044
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:48,670
You knew that it was just sparring.
There was other people.

2045
01:36:48,671 --> 01:36:52,420
It was to the death.
It's terrible.

2046
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:54,280
Crazy.
Not only that,

2047
01:36:54,281 --> 01:36:56,650
we did it over a fucking thin,
uh,

2048
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,513
office carpet on top of concrete.
It was just office carpet on top of 

2049
01:37:02,741 --> 01:37:04,300
concrete,
so when people would fall,

2050
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:08,710
a kid would bounce off the concrete.
Oh fuck.

2051
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,930
Yeah.
It was horrible.

2052
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:12,850
Good Lord.
That's the eighties,

2053
01:37:12,851 --> 01:37:14,140
Bro.
She was different.

2054
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:18,460
No good.
So terrible.

2055
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,750
So terrible back then,
man.

2056
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:25,500
People like people couldn't get 
concussions back then or something.

2057
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,390
Oh,
they got him.

2058
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:28,420
They got a lot of them.
Yeah.

2059
01:37:28,421 --> 01:37:29,254
I remember people getting them when they
were just fucked up for months and 

2060
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:34,810
months at a time.
He'd get mean.

2061
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:35,703
You get that kind of a concussion when 
you bounce your head off the ground and 

2062
01:37:40,451 --> 01:37:41,860
then,
you know,

2063
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:46,360
just the impact of something like that.
It's just,

2064
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:47,980
it's so devastating,
man.

2065
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:52,360
That's just so bad for you.
There's a great video.

2066
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:55,680
Not Great,
but kind of crazy.

2067
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:01,370
If you go to Saxon Moitai,
I'm on instagram.

2068
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:05,630
There's a video of these two guys 
fighting in the parking lot and uh,

2069
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:10,500
one guy's obviously a trained fighter 
and he's fighting these gang bangers and

2070
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:11,334
uh,
he leg kicks one of them and then 

2071
01:38:12,331 --> 01:38:14,460
punches him in the face.
And so the guys going,

2072
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,200
Oh,
you think you're going to kick?

2073
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,970
Boy,
you think you're going to kick homeboy,

2074
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:18,901
and he goes,
come on,

2075
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:19,800
kick me,
motherfucker,

2076
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:23,430
and he takes a puff of the cigarette and
he takes his shirt off.

2077
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:24,323
He's going to fight.
He has no idea how to fight and he's 

2078
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:26,934
decided he's going to fight this guy who
knows how to fight and this guy leg 

2079
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:32,250
kicks him,
drops him to the ground,

2080
01:38:32,251 --> 01:38:33,084
he gets up.
The guy shoots a double lift's his legs 

2081
01:38:34,801 --> 01:38:37,440
up in the air and dropped him on his 
head and he just goes out.

2082
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:40,380
Yeah,
it's so watching.

2083
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,520
There's something about watching 
someone's head bounce off concrete.

2084
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:46,500
That is so fucking disturbing

2085
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:48,990
for sure.
It's just,

2086
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:51,390
it's.
It's sad or you find it.

2087
01:38:51,391 --> 01:38:52,230
Anything else?

2088
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:54,100
Saxxon Moy.
Tai,

2089
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,850
you didn't see it.
Maybe somebody pulled it.

2090
01:38:57,710 --> 01:38:58,980
Must pull it up.
Let me see it.

2091
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,860
I once had a concussion in asc.
The page.

2092
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,170
Let me scroll down a little bit.
Hold on.

2093
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:06,760
We'll go to the top again.
Yep,

2094
01:39:06,761 --> 01:39:08,410
that's it.
Go scroll down a little bit.

2095
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:11,670
Yeah.
Somebody wants to pull it.

2096
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:15,580
I got an a in a wrestling match.
One time.

2097
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:17,280
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it wasn't sex on,

2098
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:22,170
I threw up Rice Krispie treats 
everywhere I was out,

2099
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,093
I was unconscious and I was throwing up 
rice krispie treats because I loaded up 

2100
01:39:27,151 --> 01:39:31,170
on those after weigh ins were like an 
hour before the match.

2101
01:39:31,171 --> 01:39:35,670
I had a peanut butter and jelly and like
the back then they had just debuted,

2102
01:39:35,671 --> 01:39:39,720
it was like a new thing,
the premade super processed rice krispie

2103
01:39:39,721 --> 01:39:40,554
treats like that.
We're just coming individual packages 

2104
01:39:43,351 --> 01:39:45,620
and after cutting,
you know,

2105
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:48,480
my weight cuts were horrible,
horrible,

2106
01:39:48,481 --> 01:39:49,740
horrible.
And uh,

2107
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:53,760
so like I would just be eyeballing all 
this food all week,

2108
01:39:53,761 --> 01:39:56,700
you know what I mean.
And I remember I'd be so excited.

2109
01:39:56,701 --> 01:39:59,430
Whatever you had,
you'd be so excited for.

2110
01:39:59,431 --> 01:40:00,264
And I was way too excited about this 
whole box of rice krispie treats that I 

2111
01:40:03,151 --> 01:40:08,151
had and I probably had like four or five
right before the match and just boom out

2112
01:40:09,001 --> 01:40:09,630
like a light.

2113
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:10,920
Some dubious my head.
Yeah,

2114
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:15,060
some dude got my head wrapped up in his 
legs like it was,

2115
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:16,440
um,
it was like a,

2116
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:19,350
like almost like a double chicken wing.
Like he had.

2117
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,670
He was,
I,

2118
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:21,533
my chest was on the mat,
I think he got me in double chicken 

2119
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:26,550
wings and started to walk around my 
head,

2120
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,010
hit year.
I rolled over and then.

2121
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:30,630
But,
but I was really,

2122
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:34,830
I'm really Bridgie and agile and have a 
long neck that I can bridge up on,

2123
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:39,090
so when I bridged up on my neck and he's
just now there's nothing he can do.

2124
01:40:39,091 --> 01:40:43,530
He took his leg and swooped it and 
figure Ford my head.

2125
01:40:43,531 --> 01:40:46,530
So now I'm in a figure four with my head
and double chicken wings.

2126
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:48,310
But then when,
once he did that,

2127
01:40:48,311 --> 01:40:51,270
I bridged up again the crowd.
I remember sort of being like,

2128
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:53,070
Ooh,
you know what I mean?

2129
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:53,913
Like it's like you're not pin in May.
And then he did this thing where you 

2130
01:40:56,291 --> 01:41:01,150
just bucked back like a bull in my head 
right into the mat,

2131
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:02,043
out like out like a light.
I was taken off on a stretcher to the 

2132
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:07,420
hospital that wrestling match.
It's the only time that ever happened.

2133
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,850
How quick after that did you go back to 
wrestling?

2134
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:11,673
Oh,
probably probably a week or two or 

2135
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:16,180
assistant coaches.
Son had just died,

2136
01:41:16,181 --> 01:41:17,014
so like that,
that night was like dedicated to him 

2137
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,510
because he showed up.
We weren't expecting him to be there.

2138
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:24,643
How's The sun was like leukemia or 
something like that and we weren't 

2139
01:41:27,941 --> 01:41:28,774
expecting him to be there in like our 
head coach gave us one of those pep 

2140
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:37,711
talks like coach Burton's common tonight
and he's coming after his son dies.

2141
01:41:37,821 --> 01:41:40,240
Then you motherfuckers better not give 
up.

2142
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:42,520
Like it was one of those like super 
crazy,

2143
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:47,410
like beyond all of our human potential,
which is probably why I ended up in that

2144
01:41:47,411 --> 01:41:50,500
position in the first place because I'm 
just bridging for everything,

2145
01:41:50,501 --> 01:41:53,740
including my assistant coaches,
son spirit and all of this.

2146
01:41:53,741 --> 01:41:55,870
You know what I mean?
Better not give up.

2147
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:56,570
Right?

2148
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:57,321
Oh,
this is it.

2149
01:41:57,321 --> 01:41:58,840
This is the video sent to me on.
Oh,

2150
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:00,960
here it is on Worldstar.
Watch this.

2151
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:03,320
He kept some with the leg kick.
The guy gets up.

2152
01:42:03,321 --> 01:42:05,330
Now watch this.
Watch this.

2153
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:10,240
Boom.
Strong leg.

2154
01:42:10,241 --> 01:42:12,400
Perfectly timed.
Watch this.

2155
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:15,490
Watch this.
Ah,

2156
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:21,800
out.
Go from the beginning though.

2157
01:42:21,801 --> 01:42:23,930
In the beginning you see long.
It's two minutes long.

2158
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:24,813
Yeah.
But at the beginning you see how the 

2159
01:42:25,911 --> 01:42:30,020
fight starts to this guy,
the guys a come on motherfucker,

2160
01:42:30,021 --> 01:42:33,290
you want some of got a shirt off.
And the guys like trying.

2161
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,500
He's by himself and he's like,
no,

2162
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:36,920
we'll do one on one.
One on one,

2163
01:42:36,921 --> 01:42:39,920
one on one.
He fought another dude first diddy.

2164
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:40,671
Yeah.
Yeah.

2165
01:42:40,671 --> 01:42:41,750
This guy,
this guy,

2166
01:42:41,751 --> 01:42:44,930
this is the guy legs kicks.
And after he laid kicks,

2167
01:42:44,931 --> 01:42:46,880
this dude,
the other guy says,

2168
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:48,380
come on,
keep it over here.

2169
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,473
Who doesn't have a wife beater on me?
Some volume on this just isn't going to 

2170
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:58,080
get taken down from youtube.
I'm trying to keep.

2171
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:58,791
Oh,
okay.

2172
01:42:58,791 --> 01:42:59,241
Okay.
Too.

2173
01:42:59,241 --> 01:43:00,950
You can turn it down.
So the guy's like,

2174
01:43:00,951 --> 01:43:02,070
come on man.
So like this,

2175
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:04,850
just one dude by himself with a bunch of
other dudes.

2176
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:06,910
But he steps in.
This guy knows how to fight.

2177
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:08,240
Look at it as throwing a jab in the 
wash.

2178
01:43:08,241 --> 01:43:10,010
This leg kick.

2179
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:13,183
Oh.
So there's quite a bit first whole 

2180
01:43:15,051 --> 01:43:16,250
different guy.
No,

2181
01:43:16,251 --> 01:43:16,700
no,
no.

2182
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:17,930
Yeah,
but that's it right there.

2183
01:43:17,931 --> 01:43:18,890
Leg kick.
Boom.

2184
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:19,753
Then he cracked some.
And so then the guy's like realizing 

2185
01:43:21,681 --> 01:43:22,514
he's in trouble.
And so he starts backing away and the 

2186
01:43:23,511 --> 01:43:24,350
guys coming forward,
he's like,

2187
01:43:24,351 --> 01:43:25,184
come on bitch.
And so then the other guy afterwards 

2188
01:43:27,561 --> 01:43:28,041
goes,
oh,

2189
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:29,690
you think you're going to load,
kick in the leg kick.

2190
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:31,460
So he comes back,
he's like,

2191
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:33,980
tired of this dude walking away from him
and he's like,

2192
01:43:33,981 --> 01:43:37,370
I fucked this dude up with one punch and
he wants it back up and this.

2193
01:43:37,371 --> 01:43:38,980
And this guy goes,
you want to Luke kick?

2194
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,360
You want to luke kick here right here.

2195
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:50,200
You want to kick them out?
This.

2196
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:54,253
He's like,
I'm going to try.

2197
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:57,650
Takes a drag of a cigarette first and 
then takes his shirt off.

2198
01:43:58,230 --> 01:44:01,580
Guy has no idea how to fight,
which is hilarious.

2199
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,650
Fat,
not in shape kick guys.

2200
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:05,703
But people are so ridiculous with this 
idea that they think they know how to 

2201
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:09,330
fight.
Yeah,

2202
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:14,270
Bang out cold.
But that's dark man.

2203
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:17,360
The banging the head,
the back of the head off the concrete is

2204
01:44:17,361 --> 01:44:17,980
dark.
Yeah,

2205
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:20,110
that's.
Memory's gone that fast.

2206
01:44:20,111 --> 01:44:21,610
It's a lot.
A lot gone.

2207
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:22,603
A lot gone with your head.
That's why I used to always getting mad 

2208
01:44:24,291 --> 01:44:28,010
at those movies where people get pistol 
whipped and nothing would happen to wake

2209
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:28,844
up.
Somebody who liked you had pistol whip 

2210
01:44:32,841 --> 01:44:34,310
you because they needed to shut your 
mouth.

2211
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:41,790
You could fucking die or like they're 
trying to get information out of them.

2212
01:44:41,791 --> 01:44:43,680
Like where's the money hidden?
It's like,

2213
01:44:43,681 --> 01:44:45,180
well now I don't remember.

2214
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:47,220
And then when they would wake up they'd 
have no problem.

2215
01:44:47,221 --> 01:44:50,940
So just be fighting.
No problems,

2216
01:44:50,941 --> 01:44:51,774
no coordination issues.
Meanwhile your equilibrium would be so 

2217
01:44:54,661 --> 01:44:56,040
fucked.
Your legs wouldn't work.

2218
01:44:56,041 --> 01:44:56,874
Right.
Have you ever been knocked out like 

2219
01:44:58,710 --> 01:44:59,543
other than that?

2220
01:45:00,690 --> 01:45:02,540
Not really,
no.

2221
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:05,840
I've been in a lot of fights,
but I've never been knocked out.

2222
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:09,050
Only that wrestling match a did it.

2223
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:11,720
When you find out how vulnerable you 
are,

2224
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:16,310
like the human brain,
the way it's positioned in the head that

2225
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:19,400
all has to do is get hit and yanked 
around.

2226
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:19,580
Okay.

2227
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:20,940
Pretty deep.
I think I have a pro.

2228
01:45:20,941 --> 01:45:21,774
Well,
I think I have what they would call a 

2229
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:25,640
good chin.
He thinks so I've taken some fucking.

2230
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:28,820
I've taken some real pain and but at 
least when I was younger,

2231
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:33,560
it's been a long time actually.
I took a good fucking solid head,

2232
01:45:33,561 --> 01:45:38,561
but about 10 years ago from my,
from one of my drunk comedian buddies.

2233
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,550
Oh God,
yeah,

2234
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:44,720
there's a great video of this girl had 
buttons go unconscious outside of a bar.

2235
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,020
You probably won't be able to find it,
but some,

2236
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:49,250
some guys fucking with her and she's not
big.

2237
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,113
She's pretty small and she grabs this 
guy by the collar and just playing and 

2238
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:58,550
the dude just crumbles and drops to the 
ground to fucking awesome.

2239
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:01,700
So it's a real movement.
This part right here,

2240
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:05,780
this is where people break their hands.
They break their hands on the top of the

2241
01:46:05,781 --> 01:46:06,614
forehead all the time.
It's not super hard spot and if you 

2242
01:46:09,171 --> 01:46:10,004
smash someone on the jaw with that are 
on the move that it chick actually can 

2243
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:14,930
pull off.
If she really knows how to do it,

2244
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:18,040
grab someone's shirt and bang.
Yeah.

2245
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:22,330
Hell yeah.
I've had a buddy people have you?

2246
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:23,263
Yeah.
I've never had anybody in my life I've 

2247
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:27,460
been.
I've had to because you know,

2248
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:31,060
I mean where I grew up,
it was just fights,

2249
01:46:31,061 --> 01:46:31,770
fights,
fights.

2250
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:33,550
That was just the whole thing.
Youngstown,

2251
01:46:33,551 --> 01:46:34,690
Ohio.
Damn right.

2252
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:35,733
Everybody was a boxer.
That's why all the boxers with me with 

2253
01:46:37,810 --> 01:46:39,040
when Kelly.
Patty showed up.

2254
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,090
Yeah,
it was awesome.

2255
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:41,080
Right.
We all went out to dinner.

2256
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:43,750
Yeah.
Matt Brown to a bunch of Ohio is hanging

2257
01:46:43,751 --> 01:46:46,630
out with Kelly pablet dude for someone 
from youngstown.

2258
01:46:46,631 --> 01:46:48,940
That's as cool as it gets.
I've hung out with.

2259
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:50,063
Boom.
I had to knock out Kelly for the 

2260
01:46:50,941 --> 01:46:53,490
trifecta and that was amazing.
We had a.

2261
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:57,720
We had a spread the size of this table.
I wasn't just any meal.

2262
01:46:57,721 --> 01:46:59,980
That was everything.
What do you want?

2263
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,920
Because everything's on the table right 
now.

2264
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,560
Yeah.
We ate a lot of good food.

2265
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,680
That was fun.
That was after the shot and steam.

2266
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:06,900
Right.
Wow.

2267
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:09,050
Schottenstein Center it,
right.

2268
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:10,063
Schottenstein.
Yeah.

2269
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:11,113
That was fun,
man.

2270
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,320
That was a fun call.
Yeah.

2271
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:14,510
Only show I've ever worn a football 
jersey.

2272
01:47:14,690 --> 01:47:18,530
That was.
That was so cool.

2273
01:47:18,531 --> 01:47:20,750
I fucking Love Ohio.
I love Columbus.

2274
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:22,430
Columbus is the Anti Connecticut.

2275
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:26,580
Absolutely.
One hundred percent fun.

2276
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:28,420
They're mad,
the opposite of Connecticut.

2277
01:47:28,750 --> 01:47:29,440
It's,
I mean,

2278
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,490
people from Connecticut,
like,

2279
01:47:30,491 --> 01:47:32,440
what would I move to Columbus?
Just trust me.

2280
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:36,220
Like if I would've done that same show 
that I did in Connecticut in Columbus,

2281
01:47:36,221 --> 01:47:37,054
and there was an angry,
a lady that looked that angry in the 

2282
01:47:39,431 --> 01:47:41,470
audience one face looking at me and I 
said,

2283
01:47:41,471 --> 01:47:44,290
what are you so angry about?
She would answer the question.

2284
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,153
Yeah,
yeah.

2285
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,240
She would tell you,
yeah,

2286
01:47:46,241 --> 01:47:48,150
you shouldn't have said that about the 
meeting.

2287
01:47:49,850 --> 01:47:50,683
And then at least I'd be able to really 
go back and forth than I'd win winter 

2288
01:47:54,431 --> 01:47:55,264
over.
But in Connecticut they just stay 

2289
01:47:56,111 --> 01:47:56,944
staunch.

2290
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:57,631
Oh,
that's young.

2291
01:47:57,631 --> 01:47:59,220
Jamie's photograph.
Yeah.

2292
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:00,750
Young Jamie.
Photographer.

2293
01:48:00,751 --> 01:48:01,584
Extraordinary

2294
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:04,210
number 18 for the Ohio state buckeyes.

2295
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:06,590
We.
So,

2296
01:48:06,591 --> 01:48:07,424
uh,
what's going on with young Tony 

2297
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:10,580
Hinchcliffe career?
What's the latest?

2298
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:12,980
I know you've been killing it with kill 
Tony.

2299
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:16,610
Tony is on a whole nother level.
We're having a lot of fun.

2300
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:19,340
It's a blast.
We're taking them all over the road.

2301
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:22,580
The road shows are insane.
Toronto was insane.

2302
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:25,610
Absolutely insane.
Absolutely insane.

2303
01:48:25,611 --> 01:48:28,400
We just did two shows in one night in 
San Francisco.

2304
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:30,260
Killed Tony Mania.
Where'd you guys go?

2305
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:32,310
Chaos.
COBB's Ah,

2306
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:35,390
two shows in one night on a Friday night
and Saturday.

2307
01:48:35,391 --> 01:48:38,360
The shows at home are crazy.
We have Whitney Cummings on Monday.

2308
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:41,480
We have this new cool thing called the 
apollo 13,

2309
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:44,150
which is a,
which is this group of black people that

2310
01:48:44,151 --> 01:48:44,984
come every Monday,
like really basically like if any open 

2311
01:48:48,531 --> 01:48:53,360
miker ever does like to racist of a joke
or if it's on the line or whatever,

2312
01:48:53,361 --> 01:48:56,240
they're like the judges like I'll like 
point to them and it's like,

2313
01:48:56,241 --> 01:48:58,110
ah,
it's hilarious.

2314
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:58,963
So funny.
We call them the apollo 13 because I 

2315
01:49:00,381 --> 01:49:01,214
said that.
They're like,

2316
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,950
yeah,
it's like David,

2317
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,480
I'm shirts made three of the members 
right there.

2318
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:06,480
But it's like,
hi,

2319
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:09,890
you're always adding new elements and 
always mixing it up.

2320
01:49:09,891 --> 01:49:14,891
But it is one of the best live podcast 
format ever will because it's so crazy.

2321
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:16,873
It's so chaotic and you're guaranteed to
either get good comedy or terrible 

2322
01:49:20,721 --> 01:49:22,460
comedy,
which equals great comedy.

2323
01:49:22,461 --> 01:49:23,294
Yeah.

2324
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:25,540
Just to show you a span this past 
Monday,

2325
01:49:25,541 --> 01:49:29,860
we started the show off with a former 
reality star that,

2326
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,840
uh,
that was horrible,

2327
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:32,950
right?
He wasn't funny.

2328
01:49:32,951 --> 01:49:36,400
He's been doing it 14 years,
but he doesn't put any work into it,

2329
01:49:36,401 --> 01:49:38,500
no work ethic,
you know what I mean?

2330
01:49:38,501 --> 01:49:40,780
So it's like we roasted him in the 
crowd,

2331
01:49:40,781 --> 01:49:43,150
loves it because he's such an easily 
hateable guy.

2332
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:44,313
The last guy we pull out of the bucket 
comes out of the audience area a with 

2333
01:49:47,710 --> 01:49:51,970
wearing shorts and one of his legs is a,
is amputated.

2334
01:49:51,971 --> 01:49:52,804
He has uh,
he has like a prosthetic leg and he 

2335
01:49:55,931 --> 01:49:56,764
talks about how he nearly died six 
months ago in a motorcycle accident and 

2336
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:03,580
he's a huge kill Tony Fan and this is 
his first time doing standup.

2337
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:04,443
This will,
we find this out after he has a decent 

2338
01:50:05,891 --> 01:50:09,020
set for a minute.
It's his first time ever doing stand up.

2339
01:50:09,050 --> 01:50:12,070
The show keeps him from being depressed 
and all that,

2340
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:12,913
you know what I mean?
Like so this wide span is what helps 

2341
01:50:16,481 --> 01:50:19,220
make it refillable like what you were 
saying and you know,

2342
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:24,300
it's just so cool because we're 
basically when it comes to that pc stuff

2343
01:50:24,821 --> 01:50:28,870
that we were talking about earlier,
like I don't know if there's many places

2344
01:50:28,871 --> 01:50:29,704
where the vent for that where,
where you can get a real barometer 

2345
01:50:31,721 --> 01:50:33,580
because look,
we have the apollo 13,

2346
01:50:33,581 --> 01:50:34,414
which they're called the apollo 13 
because it's like showtime at the 

2347
01:50:36,401 --> 01:50:37,990
Apollo,
but there's 13 of them.

2348
01:50:37,991 --> 01:50:41,740
So I call them the apollo 13.
This group of black people.

2349
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:43,480
So like for example,
a few weeks ago,

2350
01:50:43,481 --> 01:50:44,314
this one kid,
like it doesn't even seem like he's 21 

2351
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:48,393
closes on this horrible joke about Kanye
was somebody needs to throw Kanye up 

2352
01:50:52,051 --> 01:50:57,051
banana or something like that in the way
it's the whole place is in chaos.

2353
01:50:57,551 --> 01:51:00,910
Groaning in the apollo 13 standing up 
like ah ha.

2354
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:07,720
And it's like know since it's such a 
live show that's sort of like,

2355
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:09,040
you know,
if you,

2356
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:11,620
if you make a racist joke,
that's not funny,

2357
01:51:11,621 --> 01:51:14,110
you're going to die dude.
You know what I mean?

2358
01:51:14,111 --> 01:51:16,630
Like that's the worst type of,
you know,

2359
01:51:16,631 --> 01:51:19,660
so since there's a real live comedy 
crowd,

2360
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,333
you get a real good barometer for what's
going on and it makes it more exciting 

2361
01:51:24,731 --> 01:51:28,240
and it's just so,
so fun what we're doing.

2362
01:51:28,270 --> 01:51:30,310
Keeping it refillable,
like what you said,

2363
01:51:30,311 --> 01:51:32,860
finding new ways to tweak it here and 
there.

2364
01:51:32,861 --> 01:51:33,700
And you know,
every time I go

2365
01:51:33,730 --> 01:51:34,563
go,
I do it like once every six months or 

2366
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:36,580
something like that.
Yeah,

2367
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:38,950
it's always a new element is always 
something new.

2368
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:39,813
Something.
And the fact that the background guys 

2369
01:51:41,741 --> 01:51:42,574
like Jeremiah and all those guys like 
change outfits all the time and it 

2370
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:48,580
constantly doing new things.
It's just so ridiculous show.

2371
01:51:48,581 --> 01:51:51,010
And that's the king.
[inaudible] is the fucking king.

2372
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,230
Yup.
He is so good at that shit.

2373
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,110
Oh my God.
What a smile.

2374
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:55,953
But red band.
Look at him.

2375
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,833
Feel sad,

2376
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,100
so serious.

2377
01:51:58,110 --> 01:51:59,950
Stole Dog.
Fuck.

2378
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:02,340
[inaudible] the king of that shit 
though.

2379
01:52:02,341 --> 01:52:03,930
He really is.
He's so good at it.

2380
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:05,420
He really is.
He said,

2381
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,340
you know,
if he did it,

2382
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:10,400
he did this thing a couple of weeks ago 
where he said to a guy like,

2383
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:11,263
he's like,
I like how you don't try to do that 

2384
01:52:12,471 --> 01:52:14,290
whole funny thing.
You know,

2385
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:17,810
everybody else tries these punchlines,
these comedy things,

2386
01:52:17,811 --> 01:52:20,150
not you.
Different Path all together.

2387
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,220
Like he's so great at that.
He just says it like,

2388
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:24,770
it's like he's giving a big compliment.
The new thing.

2389
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:27,320
What's the Hannah Gadsby Path?
Oh

2390
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,910
yeah.
Of people are doing anti comedy.

2391
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:30,860
Catch up,
Tony.

2392
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:31,783
Yeah.
I guess I will fucking cis gendered 

2393
01:52:33,201 --> 01:52:34,940
white male piece of Shit.

2394
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:36,860
I'm the bad guy.
Yup.

2395
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:38,310
But yeah,
just uh,

2396
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:39,193
doing a lot of standup,
ramping up to hopefully make another 

2397
01:52:40,941 --> 01:52:44,240
special soon and uh,
I feel good about things.

2398
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:46,580
So we'll see happens.
Life is good.

2399
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,080
I'm pumped.
Beautiful.

2400
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:49,250
Yeah.
Good to hear.

2401
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,660
It's gonna be.
It's gonna be.

2402
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:51,583
It's gonna.
Be a naughty special when and if it 

2403
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:54,890
happens,
not going to be like Nanette.

2404
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:56,330
You're going to be naughty.
Yeah.

2405
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:58,730
Hm.
We're going to talk about some things.

2406
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:00,920
Are you.
I'm planning on being naughty or he just

2407
01:53:00,921 --> 01:53:01,754
naughty all the time.
It's modern day naughtiness and late 

2408
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:09,170
night naughtiness built in the darkness.
You comedy stores.

2409
01:53:09,171 --> 01:53:09,320
Yeah.

2410
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:10,153
Good time for comedy.
Like a lot of people are complaining 

2411
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:13,640
about comedy right now and they think is
somehow or another,

2412
01:53:13,641 --> 01:53:16,700
this is a bad time for comedy,
but ours should fear said it best.

2413
01:53:16,701 --> 01:53:17,534
He said,
you know what's good about comedy right 

2414
01:53:17,931 --> 01:53:19,220
now?
Comedy is dangerous.

2415
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:20,093
Yeah.
There's real consequences to saying 

2416
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:22,670
fucked up things.

2417
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:27,870
I agree 100 percent and in it makes us.
Some comedians are leaning towards it,

2418
01:53:29,081 --> 01:53:29,651
right?
Like,

2419
01:53:29,651 --> 01:53:31,000
ah,
I want that one.

2420
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:32,890
I don't want to talk about that.
I don't want to talk about that.

2421
01:53:32,891 --> 01:53:35,080
I don't want to talk about that,
and they're.

2422
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:39,010
They're losing the losing the fun 
because all of a sudden I get up there.

2423
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:41,680
You know what I mean?
You have the whole.

2424
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:44,080
All of a sudden you're touching the 
untouchable.

2425
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:45,580
It's exactly right.

2426
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:46,503
It's also there's fun in explaining 
yourself this fun and navigating the 

2427
01:53:50,471 --> 01:53:52,920
waters like this.
One of the things that I.

2428
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:53,773
I made sure that I did.
I thought very thought out very 

2429
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:01,720
thoroughly when I did strange times that
my last special,

2430
01:54:01,721 --> 01:54:02,554
I wanted to make sure I really thought 
out how I can pull these bits off and 

2431
01:54:06,071 --> 01:54:11,071
how I can make them like you,
Doug Stan Hope said it best.

2432
01:54:11,171 --> 01:54:13,960
He said he looks at his material like a 
defense attorney,

2433
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:15,533
like as if he's defending his,
his material like that's a great way to 

2434
01:54:18,221 --> 01:54:20,560
look at it.
I look at my material like I'm a hater.

2435
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:21,583
Like if I was a hater,
how would I poke fun at that file is 

2436
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:27,130
someone who is looking to be offended,
how would I so get that out of the way.

2437
01:54:27,131 --> 01:54:32,131
Like there was some bits that I did in 
the last one in triggered that I changed

2438
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:33,993
a lot of what they were from the 
beginning to when I put them on film 

2439
01:54:37,391 --> 01:54:40,270
because of the way audience members were
reacting.

2440
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:40,721
I was like,
well,

2441
01:54:40,721 --> 01:54:44,510
clearly I'm having a problem with this 
where they're not I,

2442
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:48,640
I'm not even getting to the switch.
I'm not getting to the misdirect because

2443
01:54:48,641 --> 01:54:51,130
they're upset before I get to the 
misdirect.

2444
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:52,770
I'm not.
It's in.

2445
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:55,300
It'll be fine if they let me get to the 
end,

2446
01:54:55,301 --> 01:54:57,580
but sometimes they would heckle or they 
would get upset.

2447
01:54:57,581 --> 01:55:00,640
Like One lady at the comedy store,
I had explained to her twice.

2448
01:55:00,641 --> 01:55:01,510
I go,
listen,

2449
01:55:01,570 --> 01:55:04,270
I'm saying it like this because I'm 
going to shit on myself afterwards.

2450
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:06,820
This is what I'm saying.
And this is what it was a bit about.

2451
01:55:06,821 --> 01:55:08,170
You remember that bit I used to do 
about,

2452
01:55:08,171 --> 01:55:09,004
um,
a women can do anything men can do or 

2453
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:15,160
that's not true because men can't do 
everything.

2454
01:55:15,310 --> 01:55:18,220
Some men can do.
That's why we have the Olympics.

2455
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:20,020
Like the idea that everybody can do 
everything.

2456
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:20,853
That's ridiculous.
I go because it was the woman who 

2457
01:55:22,631 --> 01:55:24,290
guarded the White House.
Oh yeah,

2458
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:24,940
yeah,
yeah.

2459
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:27,130
I was like,
I can't guard the White House.

2460
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:27,993
Do you know how I know?
Because I met Shaquille o'neal and his 

2461
01:55:29,801 --> 01:55:32,560
Dick is where my faces and I had 
explained to her like,

2462
01:55:32,561 --> 01:55:33,700
this is the,
see,

2463
01:55:33,701 --> 01:55:34,534
this is where I was going to go with it.
If the White House is experiencing a 

2464
01:55:36,561 --> 01:55:39,190
Shaq attack,
I'm the last guy to save the earth.

2465
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:41,020
Okay.
He's just too fucking big.

2466
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:43,500
You know,
and I would explode,

2467
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:46,150
I was trying to get to this,
but I was,

2468
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,390
this lady was getting upset at me before
I was,

2469
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:49,560
so I had to think,
I was like,

2470
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:51,690
okay,
if this was a drunk dummy,

2471
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:52,613
how do I keep the drunk dummy from 
popping off before I get to the 

2472
01:55:55,561 --> 01:55:56,394
misdirect?
Like,

2473
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:57,443
so I had to restructure things and I had
to figure out a way to make it so that 

2474
01:56:00,061 --> 01:56:02,880
it's clear and like you,
um,

2475
01:56:04,330 --> 01:56:05,163
you just have to,
you just have to navigate the waters 

2476
01:56:07,141 --> 01:56:07,974
more carefully,
but you could still get just as much 

2477
01:56:10,051 --> 01:56:10,884
juice out of it,
just as much comedy and just as much 

2478
01:56:13,621 --> 01:56:14,850
shit that's forbidden.

2479
01:56:15,610 --> 01:56:17,160
Taboo topics.
It's just,

2480
01:56:17,161 --> 01:56:20,650
you have to be really clear.
You have to be real,

2481
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:21,840
you have to have good writing.

2482
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:22,673
That's what's great about doing the 
clubs on the road before necessarily 

2483
01:56:26,611 --> 01:56:27,730
doing,
you know,

2484
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:30,750
bigger venues or whatever is because you
really can feel them,

2485
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:31,753
you know,
you feel where those moments are 

2486
01:56:33,211 --> 01:56:35,980
sometimes in a bigger venue,
uh,

2487
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:37,210
you,
you sort of,

2488
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:38,490
you,
you just,

2489
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:41,420
you're sort of taking a gamble.
You know what's going to.

2490
01:56:41,421 --> 01:56:43,620
We know what's going to get a laugh.
I'm not a laugh,

2491
01:56:43,621 --> 01:56:45,420
but you can't really feel.
They're like,

2492
01:56:46,130 --> 01:56:46,570
don't do it.

2493
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:48,340
Develop material in a big club.
Right.

2494
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:50,380
Well,
I'd like a 10,000

2495
01:56:50,381 --> 01:56:54,640
seat room.
You don't develop material at a like Air

2496
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:55,270
Canada center,
the,

2497
01:56:55,270 --> 01:56:57,400
you know,
the Scotia Bank arena that we went to,

2498
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,290
you know,
develop any material there.

2499
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:00,870
You better have that shit solid.

2500
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:03,660
Yeah.
You can't even have it memorized.

2501
01:57:03,661 --> 01:57:07,770
It has to be part of your flow.
You're better than anything.

2502
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:09,420
You have to know it better than you know
anything.

2503
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:10,430
But like,
what is it,

2504
01:57:10,431 --> 01:57:11,850
the funny bone in Columbus?
Yeah.

2505
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:15,350
That place you develop material there.
Comedy Works,

2506
01:57:15,351 --> 01:57:18,200
Denver developed material there.
Develop material and clubs.

2507
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:19,870
You have to have both.
I,

2508
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:24,260
I firmly believe that those guys who 
just do big places and they only play to

2509
01:57:24,261 --> 01:57:26,690
their audiences,
they're fucking themselves.

2510
01:57:26,691 --> 01:57:27,524
Totally.
It's like an athlete that doesn't 

2511
01:57:28,551 --> 01:57:30,650
strength train or it's like,
you know,

2512
01:57:30,651 --> 01:57:31,900
someone who doesn't,
uh,

2513
01:57:31,930 --> 01:57:32,580
they,
they,

2514
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:34,580
they work out,
but they don't watch their diet.

2515
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:37,220
It's like you got man,
you gotta if you want the best results,

2516
01:57:37,221 --> 01:57:38,210
you got to do the whole thing.

2517
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,330
They're out of touch.
I mean,

2518
01:57:39,331 --> 01:57:41,340
you gotTa,
you gotTa do the whole thing.

2519
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:43,110
They,
those people.

2520
01:57:43,550 --> 01:57:44,580
Let's just,
I mean,

2521
01:57:44,910 --> 01:57:45,743
I don't want to name any names,
but let's just say a guy that's super 

2522
01:57:50,221 --> 01:57:52,980
duper famous goes to a theater,
you know,

2523
01:57:52,981 --> 01:57:53,814
one of those big legends.
What they don't do is they don't 

2524
01:57:56,641 --> 01:58:00,100
experiment not being funny.
What they should do is they should hire,

2525
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:04,020
have a secret five minute experimental 
bit buried in their set.

2526
01:58:04,021 --> 01:58:07,470
That's purposely nothing funny about it.
And we're on it.

2527
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:11,100
And when they hear those laughs,
that's when they'll realize like,

2528
01:58:11,190 --> 01:58:14,040
oh shit.
Oh Shit.

2529
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:16,860
They're laughing no matter what because 
I have them trained.

2530
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:21,180
Is that true?
If it's their fans and their dumb comedy

2531
01:58:21,181 --> 01:58:22,014
fans,

2532
01:58:22,610 --> 01:58:23,443
I'll laugh at things that aren't funny,
but I think they're going to laugh 

2533
01:58:25,011 --> 01:58:27,920
harder at things that aren't as good.
I think they're gonna want,

2534
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:30,470
like I went to see a comic.
I'm not gonna name any names.

2535
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,210
Me and Joey Diaz went to Sam,
uh,

2536
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:35,000
because we were playing in the place the
next night.

2537
01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:36,890
Yeah.
And it was,

2538
01:58:37,550 --> 01:58:38,383
it was one of those situations where 
someone was doing their material for 

2539
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:43,780
audience and you could tell they hadn't 
been working out in the clubs.

2540
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:46,900
You could just see it and the people 
wanted to laugh.

2541
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:48,460
They want it to laugh.
There were,

2542
01:58:48,461 --> 01:58:50,440
there were,
there were fans and they were with it.

2543
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:54,700
That's the difference between that and 
say a set at the store when it's 11:00

2544
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:55,533
PM on a Tuesday night when they've 
already seen you and Joey Diaz and Ari 

2545
01:58:59,711 --> 01:59:03,490
and all these other killers like you 
gotta be funny.

2546
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:04,660
Actually.
Funny.

2547
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:07,300
It doesn't matter if you're,
you know,

2548
01:59:07,301 --> 01:59:10,460
some fill in the name whatever fucking 
superstar.

2549
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:11,343
You have to actually be funny.
They give you a minute or two to get 

2550
01:59:13,751 --> 01:59:18,220
settled in on stays the clap and they're
excited to see you come with the fucking

2551
01:59:18,221 --> 01:59:19,054
jokes.

2552
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:21,000
Barely.
Did they give you a minute?

2553
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:23,040
Really?
They started second.

2554
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:26,040
They really do.
It's really truly 30 seconds.

2555
01:59:26,041 --> 01:59:30,620
Especially in the or it really is.
It really is a he,

2556
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:31,523
it's so hard to recover from a spinout 
so much easier to start strong and take 

2557
01:59:36,091 --> 01:59:41,091
chances and fizzle out than it is to not
start off on the right foot and get them

2558
01:59:41,641 --> 01:59:43,380
going.
It's also because they're right on top,

2559
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:47,250
be on the or they're right there and 
then you could just high five them

2560
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:50,730
and they know that at that point they 
know what's going on.

2561
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:51,593
They know you better get to it.
They've already seen six of their 

2562
01:59:57,181 --> 01:59:58,014
favorite new comedians that they're 
already waiting to google the lineup 

2563
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:03,390
after they go home,
like they're like,

2564
02:00:03,391 --> 02:00:05,340
oh my God,
this is crazy,

2565
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,920
and they know what the blue light in the
corner means.

2566
02:00:07,921 --> 02:00:09,030
All of a sudden they're like,
oh,

2567
02:00:09,031 --> 02:00:09,864
this guy's got three more minutes.
You better fucking stick that landing 

2568
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:16,230
that they're not that dumb.
It takes what?

2569
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:18,660
Seeing two or three comedians in the 
original room,

2570
02:00:18,661 --> 02:00:19,494
which is only 45 minutes before your 
train and you know everything that's 

2571
02:00:22,591 --> 02:00:22,980
going,
woo.

2572
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:24,390
Here comes the piano guy.
Oop,

2573
02:00:24,391 --> 02:00:26,670
there goes the light.
You see the guy walking.

2574
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:29,760
Exactly,
exactly.

2575
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:31,590
The weirdest places,
the belly room.

2576
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:34,680
That's the weirdest rail.
I fucking love that room.

2577
02:00:34,690 --> 02:00:35,880
That room.
So weird.

2578
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:37,800
The birthplace of kill Tony.

2579
02:00:37,950 --> 02:00:40,020
That's another thing that makes kill 
Tony Bon is.

2580
02:00:40,021 --> 02:00:44,370
It's like it was totally just.
It was a belly room baby and now you see

2581
02:00:44,371 --> 02:00:48,390
this big man like having killed Tony 
Mania.

2582
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:49,253
I drove a van of 14 people up there,
saw a big giant picture up from 

2583
02:00:54,001 --> 02:00:55,860
instagram.
It was one of the coolest things.

2584
02:00:55,861 --> 02:00:58,130
I can't remember who was talking to last
night.

2585
02:00:58,240 --> 02:00:59,370
I says,
yeah,

2586
02:00:59,371 --> 02:01:03,120
and I said it was the coolest 24 hours 
of my life because I picked everybody up

2587
02:01:03,121 --> 02:01:05,550
at the comedy store.
I go be at the comedy store,

2588
02:01:05,551 --> 02:01:07,320
9:00
AM Friday morning.

2589
02:01:07,410 --> 02:01:10,080
I'm going to pick you up and I'm driving
everybody back that night.

2590
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:11,783
And I literally did.
I went and rented this big cool bad ass 

2591
02:01:14,821 --> 02:01:15,654
fucking luxury van.
So you did two shows in San Francisco 

2592
02:01:18,241 --> 02:01:20,250
and then you drove back that night?
Hell yeah.

2593
02:01:20,251 --> 02:01:22,160
What time did you get home?
Uh,

2594
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:23,850
I think it was a seven or eight.

2595
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:25,230
Actually it was like 8:00
AM.

2596
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:27,560
How'd you stay awake?
Um,

2597
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:29,370
first of all,
after a kill.

2598
02:01:29,371 --> 02:01:30,204
Tony,
I'm a freak for like three or four 

2599
02:01:31,831 --> 02:01:33,300
hours,
so I knew that,

2600
02:01:33,301 --> 02:01:35,010
so I'm like,
that's going to be easy.

2601
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:38,280
And I was like adrenaline,
like hosting adrenaline,

2602
02:01:38,281 --> 02:01:40,670
like I'm crazy about that show.
So it's like,

2603
02:01:40,671 --> 02:01:42,870
so much like I'm growing.
I'm looking at what we're,

2604
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:44,840
what we're red bands,
fingers are,

2605
02:01:44,841 --> 02:01:47,380
I'm trying to get the guests,
all the,

2606
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:48,580
the,
the bay,

2607
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:49,320
you know,
it's,

2608
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:50,153
I'm thinking moves ahead the whole time.
I'm super wired so I knew I really just 

2609
02:01:52,611 --> 02:01:56,060
needed to survive the last two hours and
it was awesome,

2610
02:01:56,061 --> 02:01:57,230
man.
Hot Coffee,

2611
02:01:57,231 --> 02:01:59,540
beef Jerky,
cold sugar free.

2612
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:02,900
Red Bull is enough for me.
My body was like,

2613
02:02:02,901 --> 02:02:06,680
what the fuck are you doing?
When I got home,

2614
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:08,390
did you do a set Saturday night 
anywhere?

2615
02:02:08,391 --> 02:02:12,110
Damn motherfucking right.
Main Room Baby.

2616
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,060
I slept from 11:00
AM to uh,

2617
02:02:15,090 --> 02:02:18,830
to say like 6:30.
It was so cool.

2618
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:19,723
That's awesome.
But the really cool thing is cheesy as 

2619
02:02:21,621 --> 02:02:26,621
this is gonna sound is like taking those
14 people all with different backstories

2620
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:31,460
all from different years and different 
amounts of appearances.

2621
02:02:32,010 --> 02:02:36,380
Sarah wine shank and Allie Makowski were
regulars over the different years,

2622
02:02:36,381 --> 02:02:37,214
at different times that all the fans 
know from seeing them each 100 times on 

2623
02:02:41,551 --> 02:02:42,384
100 different episodes and this guy and 
this guy and this guy and this guy in 

2624
02:02:44,871 --> 02:02:49,871
the band and everybody was just on fire.
We met some of the best and worst people

2625
02:02:50,781 --> 02:02:51,614
you can imagine in all of San Francisco 
in the history of the 303 episodes of 

2626
02:02:56,121 --> 02:02:56,954
this show.
There's only been one guy that ever 

2627
02:02:58,821 --> 02:02:59,654
walked off the stage angrily that 
couldn't handle the heat that happened 

2628
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:06,530
in San Francisco like two and a half 
years ago.

2629
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:07,663
The same guy we,
we didn't realize until he did it again 

2630
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:13,460
that it was the same guy.

2631
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:14,900
They walked off.
I go,

2632
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:15,973
you know,
the only other time that anyone's ever 

2633
02:03:18,921 --> 02:03:23,360
walked off and killed Tony History was 
here in San Francisco and the crowd goes

2634
02:03:23,361 --> 02:03:24,470
and like 10,
15,

2635
02:03:24,471 --> 02:03:28,550
20 people stand up and literally go.
That was the same guy.

2636
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:31,870
That was the second guy.
God,

2637
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:36,170
I mean the energy of the show and the 
fans and everything.

2638
02:03:36,171 --> 02:03:37,400
Man.
It's so cool.

2639
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:38,293
But yeah,
I can't remember what made me get on 

2640
02:03:39,501 --> 02:03:41,510
this,
but I drove everybody there and back and

2641
02:03:41,511 --> 02:03:42,770
it made it like such,
like a.

2642
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:45,470
I was like,
I was like the dad for a day,

2643
02:03:45,471 --> 02:03:46,304
you know what I mean?
Like I bought everybody in and out on 

2644
02:03:48,081 --> 02:03:49,970
the way up there.
Like it was so cool.

2645
02:03:49,971 --> 02:03:53,360
Everybody's just so happy.
Strawberry shakes.

2646
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:56,150
The van is hilarious.
That's the second row there.

2647
02:03:56,151 --> 02:03:57,020
So like,
uh,

2648
02:03:57,180 --> 02:04:02,180
it's me and Allie Makowski in the front 
and this was John Reap in the back.

2649
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:04,370
Oh,
that's William Montgomery.

2650
02:04:04,371 --> 02:04:07,700
And he's coming for everybody's jobs.
That's that guy.

2651
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:11,360
That guy is a genius.
He's like,

2652
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:14,690
Andy Kaufman meets a fucking Tennessee 
trucker.

2653
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,553
He's common forever.
Everybody's going to know who that guy 

2654
02:04:17,211 --> 02:04:17,871
is.
Eventually.

2655
02:04:17,871 --> 02:04:19,850
He's been doing it 11 years out of 
Memphis,

2656
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:20,684
Tennessee.
And he just got here a few months ago 

2657
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:26,930
and he's just an Improv Guru.
Like he just goes like,

2658
02:04:26,931 --> 02:04:29,630
you can,
he bullshits you can ask him anything.

2659
02:04:30,170 --> 02:04:32,690
And he's literally got like that,
uh,

2660
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:33,643
that comedy twitch muscle where he just 
riffs and it's the dumbest in the most 

2661
02:04:37,741 --> 02:04:39,270
glorious shit.
At the same time,

2662
02:04:39,271 --> 02:04:41,610
this is the second row,
so you're ahead in the front here.

2663
02:04:41,611 --> 02:04:42,570
Driving.
Well,

2664
02:04:42,571 --> 02:04:45,690
Watkins takes pictures.
You got to aphrodite taken a nap.

2665
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:48,450
Look at that fro second row from the 
back.

2666
02:04:48,850 --> 02:04:49,683
He built the house artists.
You Got Josh who decided to sit in the 

2667
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:53,940
middle.
The continuous grump.

2668
02:04:53,970 --> 02:04:56,900
He gets,
he gets motion sickness in the end.

2669
02:04:57,020 --> 02:04:59,400
He didn't sit next to a window for some 
reason.

2670
02:04:59,401 --> 02:05:04,401
So that's a genuine frown on his face.
Mikey mckernan in the back left.

2671
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:08,130
I mean all these people did amazing 
things.

2672
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:10,620
It was just so incredible.
George and Christian.

2673
02:05:10,621 --> 02:05:12,810
Sling and merge at the front.
Yes.

2674
02:05:12,890 --> 02:05:13,723
Love,
like grassroots created shows like that 

2675
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:19,950
where it just started out as nothing and
then it became what it is now.

2676
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:21,330
I just,
I love shit like that.

2677
02:05:21,331 --> 02:05:23,490
I love when people have an idea and they
stick with it.

2678
02:05:23,491 --> 02:05:26,880
And when you get to start doing the 
golden pony our again speaking of which,

2679
02:05:27,070 --> 02:05:28,850
uh,
probably uh,

2680
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:33,500
probably actually a really soon.
I just gotta I just gotTa do it.

2681
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:34,510
I have to,
um,

2682
02:05:34,910 --> 02:05:37,480
I have to figure out whether I want to 
do it at the comedy store.

2683
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:39,080
Not though.
Seems like,

2684
02:05:39,730 --> 02:05:40,563
I don't know why not.
You're really good with live audiences 

2685
02:05:43,451 --> 02:05:44,284
like that off the cuff.
Why not have a show like that and do it 

2686
02:05:46,251 --> 02:05:47,084
in the belly room.
Do It on an off night and the belly 

2687
02:05:48,611 --> 02:05:49,420
room.
Yeah.

2688
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:51,790
You did one Monday night.
You were doing Monday night.

2689
02:05:51,850 --> 02:05:53,950
Yeah.
Find another leg off time.

2690
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:56,440
Ten PM.
Especially if you do it late night,

2691
02:05:56,710 --> 02:05:59,080
like some weird late night show.
Yeah,

2692
02:05:59,081 --> 02:05:59,370
I think

2693
02:05:59,370 --> 02:06:00,290
you're right.
Actually.

2694
02:06:00,291 --> 02:06:01,124
That might be the of.
I think I need to do it in front of a 

2695
02:06:03,291 --> 02:06:04,160
live audience.

2696
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:05,430
It's your forte.
Yeah.

2697
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:06,870
I mean you're great at that kind of 
stuff.

2698
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:11,190
And to do it in a small intimate room 
like the belly room and to build it back

2699
02:06:11,191 --> 02:06:13,710
up,
you can get a logo and a big sign behind

2700
02:06:13,711 --> 02:06:14,550
you.
The Golden Pony,

2701
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:18,480
our maybe a gold suit.
Maybe you do every show with a gold suit

2702
02:06:18,481 --> 02:06:20,670
on.
I liked the way you're talking now.

2703
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:24,210
I'm telling you right.
I can fulfill the prophecy,

2704
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:25,170
the prophecy

2705
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:27,860
with the mastermind.
Remember the mastermind?

2706
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:32,260
No,
the guy that writes everything

2707
02:06:32,330 --> 02:06:35,580
and executes it.
You could do something like that.

2708
02:06:35,581 --> 02:06:37,560
Like have a cool backdrop.
You know,

2709
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:39,690
like some sort of a simple portable 
backdrop.

2710
02:06:39,691 --> 02:06:41,310
We'll get that.
Oh Elvis.

2711
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:42,990
Hell,
come on.

2712
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:47,250
$40 for the cutout.
Stand up like the suits.

2713
02:06:47,251 --> 02:06:49,410
Only $40.
What's it made at?

2714
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:52,800
See if you can find one of them.
Suits.

2715
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:54,510
Gold's law.
What does that word?

2716
02:06:54,530 --> 02:06:56,070
Lemay.
What does that word mean?

2717
02:06:56,430 --> 02:06:57,520
L A M,
e dot.

2718
02:06:58,110 --> 02:06:58,943
I've seen that word before and it's one 
of those words I never bothered to look 

2719
02:07:00,901 --> 02:07:01,734
up.
Lame.

2720
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:11,030
Hold on.
What does it mean?

2721
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:15,320
A Le May suit.
Just type in suit him.

2722
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:16,760
Unable to walk normally.
No,

2723
02:07:16,761 --> 02:07:18,200
that's lane bro.
Oh,

2724
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:23,180
fabric.
It's the type of fabric

2725
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:25,630
there it is.
It's a law.

2726
02:07:25,631 --> 02:07:30,631
May is the type of fabric woven or knit 
with thin ribbons of metallic fiber.

2727
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:34,290
Oh yeah.
That's your shit.

2728
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:36,060
A fucking gold

2729
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:37,600
will may suit.
Dude.

2730
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:39,250
That's what I'm going to get.
Hold on.

2731
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:41,740
Type in gold.
Lamay suit.

2732
02:07:44,050 --> 02:07:45,220
Here we go.
Baby.

2733
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:46,840
1,200
black jacket.

2734
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:47,910
Let me see.
Suits,

2735
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:50,860
now we need to get some custom made 
shirt.

2736
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:55,000
That's we need to do.
If I hired someone to build you a suit,

2737
02:07:55,370 --> 02:07:56,170
would you?
Yeah.

2738
02:07:56,170 --> 02:07:57,940
Wear the shit out of it.
Alright,

2739
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:00,320
you kidding me?
Here's someone out that shit.

2740
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:03,160
That's ridiculous.
That one's a little ridiculous,

2741
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:04,570
isn't it?
I don't know.

2742
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:10,080
Any old iron sequin suit.
I mean that's sequent silver in there.

2743
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:15,010
That shit's going to get in your fucking
clothes and stuff.

2744
02:08:15,011 --> 02:08:17,390
It'll get in the washing machine.
It looks like a tiny suit.

2745
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:19,750
I think you need to get someone to make 
you one of them.

2746
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:25,140
I think we need to hire.
What does it say?

2747
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:26,880
It's a Ninja suit.
That's.

2748
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:28,540
Yeah.
Oh,

2749
02:08:28,541 --> 02:08:31,400

Oh Geez.

2750
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:33,540
Yeah.
Um,

2751
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:35,020
we need to get something to make you 
want.

2752
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,930
Yeah.
It needs to be tailored properly.

2753
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:37,240
Yeah,
yeah.

2754
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:38,650
Yeah.
It's got to fit you.

2755
02:08:38,830 --> 02:08:41,670
We need to get David August.

2758
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:52,190
I can't wear regular suits and that.
I'm not built like a normal person.

2759
02:08:52,580 --> 02:08:54,740
So look at that.

2812
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:56,683
but I know you wouldn't do that.
That's why it was crazy to me because 

2813
02:10:59,181 --> 02:11:00,014
I'm like either the,
either the world is different over here 

2814
02:11:02,841 --> 02:11:05,120
on the other side of the world or

2815
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:08,580
they're fucking with me.
Two things to take into consideration.

2816
02:11:08,581 --> 02:11:11,070
One is their second language,
so it's basically,

2817
02:11:11,071 --> 02:11:13,170
it's a novelty.
They're going out to see comedy,

2818
02:11:13,171 --> 02:11:14,560
which is a novelty.
Um,

2819
02:11:14,650 --> 02:11:15,483
I'm sure there are Swedish Comedians,
but I'm sure the timing and the 

2820
02:11:19,110 --> 02:11:19,943
language,
it's just very different going from a 

2821
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:24,600
Swedish style comedy to American style 
comedy,

2822
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:27,630
but they're just really polite.
So they would,

2823
02:11:27,810 --> 02:11:28,643
they would laugh and then they would 
stop and they would listen and you'll 

2824
02:11:31,770 --> 02:11:32,603
like,
it just felt like dead in between the 

2825
02:11:33,421 --> 02:11:34,254
bits.
I'm like,

2826
02:11:34,770 --> 02:11:35,760
I'm telling you,
man,

2827
02:11:35,761 --> 02:11:38,580
you did great.
But then you saw it when they were doing

2828
02:11:38,581 --> 02:11:40,260
it for my set and you're like,
oh,

2829
02:11:40,261 --> 02:11:41,280
that's how they really are.
Go,

2830
02:11:41,281 --> 02:11:42,360
yeah,
I go,

2831
02:11:42,361 --> 02:11:43,980
but they had a great time.
But they,

2832
02:11:43,981 --> 02:11:45,570
they laugh,
but they don't.

2833
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:48,280
There's not like all this chatter 
inbetween the joke,

2834
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:49,133
right?
They wait and then they laugh and again 

2835
02:11:50,581 --> 02:11:53,100
they laughed again.
But then your second set,

2836
02:11:53,101 --> 02:11:54,990
we did two shows that night.
You came out.

2837
02:11:54,991 --> 02:11:56,070
You were comfortable.
Yeah,

2838
02:11:56,110 --> 02:11:56,560
you're fine.

2839
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:57,393
Because I embraced it.
I just stayed in the pocket instead of 

2840
02:11:59,711 --> 02:12:01,150
being like,
what's going on?

2841
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:02,293
Well,
they are that way in England as well in 

2842
02:12:03,531 --> 02:12:06,380
England.
They really appreciate the craft.

2843
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:09,050
They really appreciate standup comedy 
and they really,

2844
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:12,950
really appreciate it as a show.
They're extremely polite when they watch

2845
02:12:12,951 --> 02:12:14,930
shows.
I really enjoy performing there.

2846
02:12:14,931 --> 02:12:15,764
I like it a lot.
I haven't been there in awhile and I 

2847
02:12:17,391 --> 02:12:19,730
know I should go back and I will,
I promise.

2848
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,740
But um,
the last time I was in I was like,

2849
02:12:21,741 --> 02:12:22,574
man,
they're just,

2850
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:24,500
they're intelligent,
they're polite,

2851
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:28,130
like the way their watch a show,
like they go to see a show,

2852
02:12:28,250 --> 02:12:31,310
you know,
so that places great.

2853
02:12:31,311 --> 02:12:33,230
Manchester's great.
London's Great.

2854
02:12:33,670 --> 02:12:35,240
Um,
new castle did.

2855
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:37,280
I did a lot of places in England at a 
good time.

2856
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:39,320
You know,
what else is fucking great,

2857
02:12:39,321 --> 02:12:44,300
but in a different way while doubling.
You got to do Dublin Dublin's chaos.

2858
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:45,800
Yeah.
I want to go over there.

2859
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:47,090
She got to get drunk.

2860
02:12:48,310 --> 02:12:50,080
Have they done a UFC there?

2861
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:51,000
Yeah,
it was done.

2862
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:51,740
You know,
Caesar?

2863
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:53,070
Sure.
Yeah.

2864
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:57,080
And Connor fought there,
I'm sure.

2865
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:58,170
Uh,
um,

2866
02:12:58,310 --> 02:13:03,310
I don't know if there's been a ufc in 
Dublin while he was huge though.

2867
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:08,240
I don't know.
That's a good question because they were

2868
02:13:08,241 --> 02:13:10,340
going to do like a soccer stadium over 
there.

2869
02:13:10,580 --> 02:13:13,640
What was the last time connor fought in 
Dublin?

2870
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:16,203
I don't know,
man.

2871
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:19,790
It seems like that would make sense.
Yeah,

2872
02:13:19,791 --> 02:13:22,010
it was a cage wars fight.
One UFC,

2873
02:13:22,011 --> 02:13:24,340
UFC fight against Brandao.
Oh,

2874
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:27,320
Diego Brandao second fight.
Just technically.

2875
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:28,750
Yeah.
So I think is.

2876
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:30,650
Yeah.
Yeah,

2877
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:32,340
it's the first one was in Stockholm.

2878
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:33,173
Then Boston and Dublin.
And then really what makes sense except 

2879
02:13:36,171 --> 02:13:38,270
for.
Yeah,

2880
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:39,780
now though,
Jesus Christ,

2881
02:13:39,781 --> 02:13:42,000
that God can't even walk in Dublin.
Okay.

2882
02:13:42,001 --> 02:13:42,870
I can't go anywhere.

2883
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:44,033
Ooh,
that's something that we're about to do 

2884
02:13:45,401 --> 02:13:47,140
together.
We're going to go to Toronto.

2885
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,010
Oh yeah.
Girls fighting my girls.

2886
02:13:49,011 --> 02:13:49,844
Spiky guests.
Who's undefeated with me next to the 

2887
02:13:52,181 --> 02:13:54,730
octagon?
You'll want to inject you damn right.

2888
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:58,690
Guess who's about to be member when she 
got that strawweight championship?

2889
02:13:58,691 --> 02:14:00,700
What'd she do?
She ran out of the octagon,

2890
02:14:00,730 --> 02:14:03,400
came and took a picture with Tony issue.
That's right.

2891
02:14:03,730 --> 02:14:04,563
Yes.
Yeah.

2892
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:07,000
She reached into your pants and grabbed 
your Melaleuca stick.

2893
02:14:07,030 --> 02:14:07,863
Yeah,
and I believe that's what's going to 

2894
02:14:11,261 --> 02:14:12,370
happen again.
No,

2895
02:14:12,371 --> 02:14:14,440
she didn't do any of those things folks.
We're just joking.

2896
02:14:14,441 --> 02:14:15,071
Yeah,
we're kidding.

2897
02:14:15,071 --> 02:14:17,380
But she did jump out of the octagon and 
take a picture with.

2898
02:14:17,430 --> 02:14:17,791
Well,
no,

2899
02:14:17,791 --> 02:14:18,670
that's a different one.

2900
02:14:18,980 --> 02:14:19,813
Yeah.
Punch you in the face and you're doing 

2901
02:14:21,001 --> 02:14:21,834
nothing

2902
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,153
that.
That was that one bottom right there 

2903
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:27,510
again and again and again and again.
Bottom right.

2904
02:14:28,230 --> 02:14:31,710
Yep.
Oh yeah.

2905
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:35,240
She ran right out.
She came out and she pointed at me.

2906
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,011
Yeah.
I'm going goes,

2907
02:14:36,011 --> 02:14:38,610
come over here.
Look at that with a belt on.

2908
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:40,440
Yup.
That is hilarious.

2909
02:14:41,070 --> 02:14:42,090
Yeah,
it's a tough fight,

2910
02:14:42,091 --> 02:14:44,050
man.
She's fighting volunteership Chenko.

2911
02:14:44,051 --> 02:14:47,520
Valentina is a fucking murderer,
is a monster.

2912
02:14:47,550 --> 02:14:48,383
However,
I think not having to cut that extra 10 

2913
02:14:50,581 --> 02:14:51,414
pounds is going to give you on a lot of 
pop and a lot of extra energy and we're 

2914
02:14:54,481 --> 02:14:57,330
going to see the old deal on a.
You know what I mean?

2915
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:59,780
Rose had her number technically,
and.

2916
02:14:59,781 --> 02:15:02,610
But that's the only person we've ever 
seen have her number.

2917
02:15:02,670 --> 02:15:05,520
So she,
she absolutely struggles to make,

2918
02:15:05,521 --> 02:15:05,600
make

2919
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:07,370
115 pounds.
Absolutely.

2920
02:15:07,371 --> 02:15:10,760
Undeniably she,
she's an agonizing weight cut for her.

2921
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:11,923
I think it'd be better for.
They have fought before they fought two 

2922
02:15:15,081 --> 02:15:18,260
or three times in Moitai.
And Valentine is one.

2923
02:15:18,261 --> 02:15:20,070
All the fights.
Yeah.

2924
02:15:20,660 --> 02:15:21,950
Valentina is a beast man.
Yeah.

2925
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:23,300
Yeah.
And she's bigger.

2926
02:15:23,610 --> 02:15:26,630
Valentina is coming down from 35 to 
1:25,

2927
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:28,753
but I like it a lot.
It's probably one of the more technical 

2928
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:34,730
female mma fights you're ever going to 
see in terms of like,

2929
02:15:34,750 --> 02:15:35,583
you know,
you want to be in a world champion Moy 

2930
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:40,400
Thai fighter found Tina being at that 
same level.

2931
02:15:40,610 --> 02:15:42,890
They're just both super,
super technical.

2932
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:45,200
I'm pumped.
That's going to be fun.

2933
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:47,240
We're going to hang out in Toronto.
Hell yeah.

2934
02:15:47,650 --> 02:15:50,120
All right.
Let's wrap this thing up.

2935
02:15:50,450 --> 02:15:52,160
So rocktober,
it's been a good time.

2936
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:54,380
So over.
Let me see the standings.

2937
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:59,090
See if anybody made a wild push today to
try to.

2938
02:15:59,390 --> 02:16:00,223
Is it,
does it end at midnight east coast or 

2939
02:16:02,661 --> 02:16:03,980
west coast?
You guys have.

2940
02:16:03,981 --> 02:16:04,814
Have you said that east coast,
because six hours going on with my 

2941
02:16:07,641 --> 02:16:10,910
fucking phone six and a half ago.
It won't let me open the phone.

2942
02:16:12,470 --> 02:16:13,310
Oh,
great.

2943
02:16:13,311 --> 02:16:14,144
New Bug.
Apple stuck in another location and 

2944
02:16:15,531 --> 02:16:18,950
notifications stuck in.
It hasn't even shown up.

2945
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:20,300
Look at that.
Wonderful.

2946
02:16:20,330 --> 02:16:22,220
Close it.
And then try to get wonderful new bug.

2947
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:24,380
Yeah,
but what's up with that bug?

2948
02:16:24,410 --> 02:16:25,640
That's fucking terrible.
Oh,

2949
02:16:25,641 --> 02:16:26,990
it's doing it again at a button.
You can.

2950
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,030
Wonderful.
Wonderful new bug.

2951
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:30,070
That's crazy.
You

2952
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:35,070
fucking piece of shit.
Goodnight everybody.

2953
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:39,880
Better fucking stupid.
