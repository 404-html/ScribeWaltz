1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Dream in here.
We've got 6,000 people on this 

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:06,540
motherfucker.
30003000700 for really?

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,820
That's what I'm saying.
It takes a little while.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,760
Hey,
and we're lively's gentlemen,

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,783
we're live and we're live.
This is the first time we've ever been 

6
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:19,131
live while also being live on instagram 
live.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,300
I don't ever use this shit.
Do you ever use this?

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,540
I have.
I was for awhile and it was cool,

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,403
but it's one,
it's one way to get a lot of new 

10
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:30,990
followers because if you go to top live,
which I'm sure you are,

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,460
so who's ever live,
it'll have top live with the most people

12
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:38,350
who are tuning in and so that's where 
you are right now.

13
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:40,740
And so people who don't follow you,
we'll,

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,603
we'll see you on top live.
We have 760077007800 it's getting dark 

15
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,350
and crazy in here.
Cameron hanes fresh back from Australian

16
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:53,950
outback where he's out there wrestling 
crowd it.

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,850
See those reflexes.
Photo is good and he moves the table.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,370
Didn't even come close.
That's a years of Jujitsu,

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,740
years of trying to keep people from 
choking me,

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,870
my instincts.
I'll do a little too jumpy.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,080
That's the problem.
Right?

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,290
Too much quick movement.
There's got to calm that shit down.

23
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,730
So the bonding,
oh,

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,490
right.
Well,

25
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,323
and he's the opposite.
He needed the opposite and steady baby 

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,550
bow hunting is pretty much the opposite 
way of thinking than Jujitsu.

27
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,070
Cause Jujitsu,
you gotta fucking,

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,623
you gotta keep you gotta constantly.
You've got to constantly be protecting 

29
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:27,150
yourself and move in and trying to close
the deal.

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,590
Bowhunting is like steady.
Yeah.

31
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,603
Dude,
you're out there wrestling wallabies I 

32
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:34,074
heard.
Yeah,

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,360
something like that.
Jamie's ready to go.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,100
Jamie's he was saying that and he was 
like,

35
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,780
I want to wrestle a fucking wall would 
be,

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,310
I don't think you'll will be up.

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,880
We saw a dead one and it has caused 
about that long.

38
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,751
Do they're real.
Yeah,

39
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:46,584
I mean,
so you can imagine and their legs are 

40
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:50,640
just obviously balancing all the time,
their legs.

41
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:53,100
It just got to be jacked into those big 
claws.

42
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,070
I mean what I would try to relate it to 
is,

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,360
have you ever tried to hold down a cat,
a house cat that doesn't want to be half

44
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,520
a man.
Right.

45
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,563
So they have little tiny claws match.
Have a wall would be with those jack 

46
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:06,110
legs and big claws could do.
Plus it's wild.

47
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,310
Wouldn't be good.
I just have a wild cat.

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,380
I had a feral cat.
Is that window?

49
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,270
Wow.
Your cute little fellow.

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,133
Yeah.
No.

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,450
Whoa.
That's not real.

52
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,340
Is that real?
That's really his teeth.

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,780
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,633
I'll look at the clause on those things.
If I don't know if it'll show cause 

55
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:22,650
ever.

56
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,480
I can't believe they have teeth like 
that.

57
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
See those front?
Because what the hell is the wall beat?

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,190
I figured while B it was like eating 
nuts and shitty.

59
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,150
No,
I think they're murderers.

60
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,900
Babies,
so it looks like a little kangaroo.

61
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,801
Yeah.
Oh,

62
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,420
they have a kangaroo tail and the whole 
deal.

63
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,150
They're just,
they're very similar to Kangaroos.

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,240
It was not a real teeth though.
That wasn't photoshopped.

65
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,283
Google.
Well,

66
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,530
Google wallabies teeth because I just 
have a feeling that was bullshit.

67
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,723
I just looked like a vampire there.
I feel like they're like the ugly 

68
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:54,410
stepchild of Kangaroos because they're 
kind of more hunched over.

69
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,830
I'm like,
damn,

70
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:57,210
we're losing viewers.
What?

71
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,950
Crazy.
We're top live

72
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,230
though.
We're losing viewers like crazy.

73
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,700
We're down to 5,000,
900.

74
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,070
We're dropping.
Maybe I'll turn it towards me.

75
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,140
Maybe that's a problem.
Probably when it's turned towards Cam.

76
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,940
Oh,
jumping back up.

77
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,790
So now we're up to 6,500.
It is,

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,110
it is your page.
That's after I,

79
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,023
that can't be real.
That's the one we're looking at right 

80
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,080
now is like a vampire.
Be Deer.

81
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,050
I've seen those things before.
Those vampire deer.

82
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,130
That's a real thing.
Right?

83
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,410
But those deer with those crazy things.
I think so.

84
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,310
Yeah.
It's real.

85
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,930
But like,
why do they have things like that?

86
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,200
Like why does they're not predators.
Very strange.

87
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,570
Did you see that?
Uh,

88
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,600
they found for the first time ever a 
deer eating a human carcass at deer.

89
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,170
Yeah.
The scientist.

90
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,240
See if you pull that story up,
it was yesterday.

91
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,550
All alright folks is very distracting.
Uh,

92
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,440
go to,
uh,

93
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,590
Joe rogan.live.

94
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,630
And you could see this whole thing.
I would read this,

95
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,660
but here's the thing about getting older
folks.

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,553
Your fucking eyes start to go,
cameron hanes eyes are still excellent 

97
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,520
though.
I gotta tell you this motherfucker,

98
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,703
you know,
Shit.

99
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,700
He can see anything.
Conspiracy theory.

100
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,280
We're the same age.
We're the same age and his eyes,

101
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:12,100
I don't know why my sock,
but um,

102
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,900
it's just the way it goes,
but my dick is getting bigger.

103
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,070
I don't know what's going on with that 
either.

104
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,930
No.
Imagine tit for tat.

105
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,990
People would trade in glasses for bigger
deck for sure.

106
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,010
Um,
show feet.

107
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,900
What is that?
People are so weird.

108
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,323
Some of the people put,
they put weird comments just to get you 

109
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,540
to read them.
And he got me,

110
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,710
he got me this.
Fuck.

111
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,803
All right folks.
I'm going to shut this off and we're 

112
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,220
going to,
uh,

113
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,690
just have a podcast.

114
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,523
Joe rogan.live.
You can watch for streaming on youtube 

115
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,420
until we make this big deal with twitch.
So yeah,

116
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,900
Bam.
And live video.

117
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,210
Do I save it done?
Nope.

118
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,340
Didn't save it.
Fuck it.

119
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,010
You can save them as a little thing up 
in the upper right hand corner.

120
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,480
But I didn't,
I saw it right.

121
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:56,314
I was,
I was pressing and mid press sounding 

122
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,550
like what's the big deal?
You know?

123
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,340
Dunno.
I Dunno dude.

124
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,960
I'm so never before seen deer spotted 
eating human bones.

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,913
Makes sense though.
Like they would just think it's like 

126
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:10,960
calcium.
Same.

127
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,280
Yeah.
They don't know it's a bone.

128
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,900
It's not like they like fuck these 
people.

129
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,510
So he's like finally deers Eaton beeble 
now.

130
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,990
But we've showed videos before,
um,

131
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,050
of deer eating birds.
Like,

132
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:25,090
cause they eat birds all the time.
Oh they do?

133
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

134
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,320
Like literally actively going after 
birds.

135
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,153
Like the fallen out of nests dear.
It's like following it and the birds 

136
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,960
trying to chase the deer off and there's
like,

137
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:35,441
yeah,
whatever.

138
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:36,730
I'm eating that bird.
Look at this.

139
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,780
So this bar,
this deer is the other birds.

140
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,830
They're like,
get out of there,

141
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,090
get out of it.
It's a button buck.

142
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:48,091
He's got these little tiny nubs and he's
trying to get this ground nesting bird.

143
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,150
He's going to go through the past,
that tree and then the guy filming it.

144
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,283
See?
See the bird hopping around on the 

145
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,500
ground.
So it's a bird that fell out of a nest.

146
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,570
Oh,
they don't have like the eat that?

147
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,560
Oh yeah.
100%.

148
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,483
Yeah.
It's kind of,

149
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,810
well he's,
he's chasing it.

150
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,760
I mean,
he's going after a purpose.

151
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,770
What a Predator is.
Look at the speed,

152
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,323
the speed that deer shows.
But it just shows you how opportunistic 

153
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,710
live animals are.

154
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,620
Wild animals.
Like some,

155
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,590
something in that deer's body tells it 
to eat that thing.

156
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,543
Hey,
there's no compassion out there for 

157
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,100
animals.
No watch animal.

158
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,300
An animal.
He's eating it.

159
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,280
Oh,
it's dark.

160
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,410
Yeah.
That's what he goes.

161
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,431
Yeah.
Life.

162
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,264
It's life.
It's just weird to see a deer for some 

163
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,310
reason.
Eat a bird and do it on purpose.

164
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,360
Like he's all excited.
It's like,

165
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,740
Oh yeah,
this is great.

166
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,990
He's good.
There is a,

167
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,900
um,
some sort of wildlife thing.

168
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,720
Uh,
they,

169
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,280
they were doing some sort of a survey 
and the captured these birds with a net.

170
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,390
They had this net set up,
uh,

171
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,243
in this area where these birds fly just 
so they could capture these particular 

172
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:52,724
birds.
But the deer kept eating the birds and 

173
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,180
they,
they couldn't figure it out.

174
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,380
They're like,
what is going on here?

175
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,214
And then they watched,
they had a video of these deer walking 

176
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,304
up and picking them off the net and 
eating these birds while the birds like 

177
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:05,040
Jay's house.

178
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,820
I can't believe this is happening.
Getting eaten by a deer.

179
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,710
Yeah.
You don't see that every day?

180
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,270
No.
That I'm not surprised.

181
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,740
Yeah.
I'm not surprised either.

182
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:14,990
I've seen cows do it too.
This video is a cows doing it.

183
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:15,824
For the longest time,
people didn't think that they thought 

184
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:17,900
that,
you know,

185
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:20,230
those are just herbivores.
But no,

186
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,073
they just,
nature's just set them up to be super 

187
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,114
slow.
But if something really delicious is in 

188
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,800
front of them,
I thought it was an Eddie Bravo thing.

189
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,290
Oh,
this conspiracy.

190
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,500
Yeah.
He came up with it.

191
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,720
No,
it's not an Eddie Bravo conspiracy.

192
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,610
Eddie Brow believes a lot of 
conspiracies,

193
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:36,140
but he doesn't believe that.
What does this one,

194
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,160
oh,
what does that an Eagle Jack and a bunny

195
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:42,200
rabbit.
That's a deer.

196
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,340
Deer and eagles are so ruthless.
Oh look at that.

197
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,070
Bam.
We can do this all day folks.

198
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,490
You got back from the real wild man like
when you were the instagram stories.

199
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,323
So Cameron Hanes and our buddy Adam 
Green tree and a few other fellows were 

200
00:07:58,341 --> 00:07:59,174
up there in the north country of 
Australia and you guys took over the 

201
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:03,074
under armour hunt page and uh,
it was epic man that the underarmour 

202
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,440
hunt page.
Like the little instagram stories.

203
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,180
Yeah.
I don't like instagram stories.

204
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,043
You know why?
Cause they're only 15 seconds and the 

205
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,903
old teases.
I want you guys to be like live 

206
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,140
streaming from up there.
Yeah,

207
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,003
it would be nice.
Wouldn't it put up a super cool are you 

208
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:21,390
guys were at it was terrifying.
Yeah.

209
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,930
Kept showing these brown snakes these.
Yeah.

210
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,780
The second most deadly snake in the 
world.

211
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,740
Yeah,
that's what I'm told.

212
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,270
Yeah.
You sound like how many of them?

213
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,390
Uh,
four or five.

214
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,090
Yeah,
but it only takes one.

215
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,500
Yeah.
And you're dead,

216
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,334
right?
Like,

217
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,040
I'd already watched dead.
Well,

218
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,500
second most deadly.
Yes.

219
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,110
Doesn't sound good.
That's not good.

220
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,590
No,
no.

221
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,640
And then there's,
you know,

222
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,350
big old spiders and crocodiles.
Yeah.

223
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:49,930
You guys saw crocodiles.
Yeah.

224
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,570
You even filmed crocodiles.
They were right where we were,

225
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,130
you know,
super.

226
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,980
It was,

227
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,080
I mean,
this is still not even their summer,

228
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,060
but it's still very warm.
I mean,

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,590
where we were up,
uh,

230
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,750
hunting buffalo at the top man is what 
they call,

231
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,990
which is out of Darwin.
It was 90 to a hundred degrees.

232
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,670
So there's some film of a,
now this is a freshwater crocodile,

233
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:12,504
which is not as big,
not as big or as aggressive as a 

234
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,940
saltwater Croc,
but could still definitely do damage.

235
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,990
And this was,
you know,

236
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,290
a mere feet from where we were sleeping.
And this is the,

237
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,283
where we'd go and take baths and uh,
or just kind of cooled down during the 

238
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,570
heat of the day.
That's where he was right there.

239
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,320
And how big is that guy?
Oh,

240
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,910
I dunno.
Six,

241
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,350
eight,
seven,

242
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,730
eight feet,
something like that.

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,860
You know,
he wasn't huge,

244
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,920
but he definitely do some damage and get
a hold of Ya.

245
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,770
Did you guys see any of the salt water 
once while you're there?

246
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,641
No.
No.

247
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:48,960
So when you were telling me about this a
one pond that was near you guys,

248
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,120
where you saw eyes at night and you 
didn't think of that was,

249
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,530
that was,
it was right there.

250
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,810
So the,
the first night we saw the one,

251
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,870
just that one right there,
we went over there and videoed him and,

252
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,893
and checked him out.
And then the next night Adam went down 

253
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:04,650
there to the creek and it was only about
maybe 15,

254
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,180
20 feet across,
just small,

255
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,700
just very shallow.
And uh,

256
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,490
he looked down and said there was like 
six sets of eyes,

257
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,710
red eyes,
which is crocodile.

258
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,850
So,
and that was,

259
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,290
you know,
they'd moved in.

260
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,670
So have you ever seen a live salt water 
one in the wild?

261
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,603
Um,
I think we did the last time I hunted 

262
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,700
there,
but I'm trying to remember.

263
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,220
Or maybe it was,
I think when we were flying.

264
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,041
Yeah.
When,

265
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,350
when we were flying,
we saw him.

266
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,140
Oh,
we've,

267
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,270
cause so you have to take a flight from 
where Adam lives.

268
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,350
Adam lives near Melbourne,
right?

269
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,920
Sydney,
Sydney,

270
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,823
New South Wales.
You fly four and a half hours to Darwin 

271
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,800
toward these water buffalo are.
Yep.

272
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,340
And then w w last time we used a 
helicopter to get out of Darwin to,

273
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,340
and that was four hours in the 
helicopter.

274
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,720
Whoa.
And so this time we had a helicopter and

275
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:00,554
so we flew the country,
kind of look at it and we saw some 

276
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:07,140
pretty big crocs from there on the river
system.

277
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,330
So how do you know like,
where to stop?

278
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,020
Like when your buffalo hunting,
how do you know where to go?

279
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,663
Um,
well I mean basically it's however far 

280
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,500
you can walk,
you know,

281
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,020
I mean you kind of get,
we were walking,

282
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,800
I dunno,
I want to say at least 10 miles a day.

283
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,413
10 10 to I think Adam and his guys.
One time his camera guy walked 18 miles 

284
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:33,990
one day.
So we were just,

285
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,370
you know,
we're always,

286
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:36,061
you know,
10,

287
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:37,440
12,
13 miles a day.

288
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,700
So just covering country.

289
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,263
It was,
it was hard hunting up there right now 

290
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,870
because this is their wet season or the 
tail end of their wet season.

291
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,470
And so the foliage was,
was really grown up really thick.

292
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:52,080
So it was very hard to see the buffalo 
normally,

293
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,220
um,
later when we went,

294
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,333
Eh,
it's all burnt up because of summer and 

295
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:59,650
said there's no foliage.
And,

296
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:00,484
uh,
you can see the buffalo from miles 

297
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:03,670
basically.
But with this grass,

298
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,860
the grass is in some places,
eight,

299
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,750
eight feet tall.
I mean,

300
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:10,050
you'd have to be 50 yards away to see a 
buffalo and they're,

301
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:11,620
you know,
1800,

302
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,010
1800 to 2000 pounds.
So it's,

303
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,873
it's makes it hard to find them.
And then it also makes it dangerous to 

304
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,030
trail them,
you know,

305
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,020
if your blood trailing him or if you're,
even if you just surprise one,

306
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,280
um,
you know,

307
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,470
you,
you surprise an animal that close a wild

308
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:28,600
animal like that,
and who knows how they're gonna react.

309
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,510
Yeah.
That's a huge animal.

310
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,560
Yeah.
And,

311
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,270
and with that grass,
it just,

312
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,460
you know,
as you know,

313
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,323
Adam and I did a and the camera guys,
we did a podcast up there and we were 

314
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:43,390
kind of talking about the challenges of 
the hunt and uh,

315
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,253
that was a big part of it is um,
just not being able to see very much 

316
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,980
country.

317
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,520
And so people never hunt buffalo this 
time of year.

318
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,331
This is like,
people say,

319
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,670
why would you go,
you're not gonna,

320
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,523
you know,
nobody goes this time and we just want 

321
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,963
to do,
they go,

322
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,930
they go later in the year,
you know,

323
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:00,550
when the,
when there's not so much foliage.

324
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,600
So they go like in their fall there.
Yeah.

325
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,370
It would be,
you know what,

326
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,204
last time I went is December,
which is just before the West season 

327
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,084
starts.
This is the tail end of the wet season 

328
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,184
right now.
So we were thinking about when we want 

329
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:17,190
to take you up,
there would be around November,

330
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,860
October,
November.

331
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,870
Cause you don't want to get stuck in 
with the wet season,

332
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,390
hit big rains.
But uh,

333
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:23,290
you,
you want it.

334
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,313
And,
and also it makes it easier to find the 

335
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,780
animals because there's not water 
everywhere right now.

336
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:32,590
There's water everywhere so they don't 
have to be concentrated to get water.

337
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,753
But later in the year,
all those lot of the water sources have 

338
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,560
dried up.
So if you've got a good water hole,

339
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,380
you know,
every,

340
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,660
every animal is coming there.

341
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,340
Well,
so these are for people who don't know.

342
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,233
Um,
this is an invasive species of water 

343
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:49,310
buffalo and enormous Asian.
And what is it called?

344
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:52,360
It's just called Asian water buffalo.
Like what is the actual name of it?

345
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,390
Thank it.
Or yeah,

346
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,370
there might be an ah Ha,
I just call them Asian water buffaloes.

347
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,750
That seems like there's a c in there 
somewhere.

348
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,540
Asiatic or something.
I Dunno.

349
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,320
Maybe Jamie can look at Jamie.
We'll look it up.

350
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,100
But uh,
it's uh,

351
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,100
such a wild,
cool looking animal.

352
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:08,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

353
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,370
They're big.
They're big in,

354
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,120
uh,
my bowl,

355
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,680
um,
it was a big old bowl on a,

356
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,273
uh,
we called him in using like a wounded 

357
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,870
calf call.
Oh Wow.

358
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:22,070
Wow.

359
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,810
So this is,
this is what it looks like.

360
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,480
It's a female,
obviously stepped in Asian water buffalo

361
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:28,400
and yeah,
that's it.

362
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,690
That's what it looks like.
Yeah.

363
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,080
Um,
go to Cam's a instagram page and there's

364
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,390
a picture of the,
there's is there.

365
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,170
Yeah,
there it is.

366
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,340
Now that's Adams.
Oh,

367
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:38,480
that's how items,
yeah.

368
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,790
Then there's,
yours is in the upper right hand corner,

369
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,970
but you only see,
right?

370
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,720
Cisco the only see the skull.
Yeah.

371
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:47,720
And then that's a fucking head.
People don't want to see that.

372
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,450
What is he doing now,
folks?

373
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:51,890
That's how you make fine.

374
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,440
There's only one way.
There's another picture of it,

375
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:56,570
I think when it's coming in and when 
he's coming in right there.

376
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:57,710
Right above that,
Jamie.

377
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,330
Right.
Uh,

378
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,280
right now

379
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,080
the one with the far left.
Yeah.

380
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,830
Right.
Yeah.

381
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,663
Right there.
That's a him at full draw or would the 

382
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,330
that's looking through the riser of the 
bow.

383
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,130
Yeah.
So that's that bowl coming in.

384
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:10,180
Aggressive.
He was,

385
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,720
you can see his eyes.
He was just pissed off and that's,

386
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,823
he was coming,
that's at under 20 yards and he's not 

387
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:18,544
stopping.
And so I shot him there frontal through 

388
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,190
the chest and uh,
had to,

389
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,990
is uh,
almost like self defense.

390
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,163
Wow.
So these are animals that if hunters 

391
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,380
don't go up there and kill them,
they actually hire people to go up there

392
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:34,260
and killed him right there.

393
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,300
Yeah.
They,

394
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,540
I mean these things have,
has spread disease up there.

395
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,374
I mean they're,
uh,

396
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,253
a non native species and they,
any water source up there is ruined any 

397
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,720
natural habitat has been ruined because 
there's so many buffalo.

398
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,540
So they just want him killed basically.
They're like,

399
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,480
um,
it'd be like similar to coyotes here,

400
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,920
you know,
kind of 2000 pounds or yeah.

401
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,940
Yeah.
Predators either.

402
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,390
No,
there's nothing else to kill him.

403
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,990
And,
and maybe a CROC could kill a small one.

404
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:03,980
Right.
But,

405
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:05,690
uh,
they just need,

406
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,820
you know,
in Coyote's down here in North America,

407
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:08,654
don't ruin water sources and ruin 
habitat like these things do these 

408
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,590
things that are just wrecking machines 
and there's,

409
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,890
there's hundreds of thousands of them up
there.

410
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,220
So they ruined Walsh water sources for 
the native animals as well.

411
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,020
I call the free things.
Anything.

412
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,790
Yeah.
Cause they shit and Piss in the water.

413
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,893
Yeah.
Yeah.

414
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,973
Well it's an,
Australia is so strange and a as is New 

415
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,100
Zealand in that all these people 
imported animals,

416
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:35,000
they're in the 18 hundreds and a,
I guess even before was it,

417
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,510
when did they establish Australia and 
New Zealand?

418
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,553
I'm not sure.
I forget when they these to see if you 

419
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,624
could find out when they established,
we talked about this recently with Josh 

420
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,473
Zaps,
didn't we?

421
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,673
But they um,
they brought in all these animals with 

422
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:48,224
no game plan.
They just let them loose and then they 

423
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,290
let the crowd,
Jesus.

424
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,340
So in New Zealand they have these 
beautiful stags,

425
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,203
these incredible animals and at some 
places they have to shoot them at of 

426
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,950
helicopters just to control the 
population,

427
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,000
which we're it for people in America,
it's like unheard of.

428
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:06,910
Like how could you do that?
Like that's that's,

429
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,230
that's like an elk,
like a majestic animal.

430
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:10,064
You're going to shoot him out of 
helicopters to just leave them there to 

431
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:11,750
die.

432
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,950
It's way different.
It's a,

433
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:13,784
you know,
up there,

434
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,833
there's just not enough hunters because 
in all of Australia they say there's as 

435
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:23,300
many people as there are in la,
the La area here in the whole country,

436
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,620
Saint New Zealand says it was a,
okay.

437
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:30,070
The first European explored a sight New 
Zealand was able,

438
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Jan's Zune,
what name Jan Zune Tasmin on the 13th of

439
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,413
December in 1642 but that's obviously 
just a European people been there for a 

440
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:43,930
long fucking time.
Oh yeah.

441
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,943
And Australia was 1788 and shortly 
thereafter then they bringing in all 

442
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:50,100
these

443
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,640
animals and the idea was that they were 
going to make it like a European hunting

444
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,630
destination.
Right.

445
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,963
For,
for rich,

446
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,210
the rich,
uh,

447
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,843
w what Douche bags.
So they released all these animals but 

448
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:06,070
with no predators.
Yeah.

449
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,540
And so people were going to come over 
from Europe and they were going to go to

450
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,670
Australia and hot the rich people.
And so I think that,

451
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,543
and they told me that seems like it was 
in 1985 they're going to wipe out all 

452
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:22,800
the buffalo and they had some money 
funded for it and they were going to try

453
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,910
to get rid of them and they got halfway 
through and quit.

454
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,280
They killed like half of them.
Something like that.

455
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:30,114
Yeah.
Wow.

456
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,240
And then they quit.
And so now it was just as I was saying,

457
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,700
the whole country is about the size of 
the United States.

458
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:36,534
You were telling me this,
but I did know that the whole country 

459
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,000
has the same amount of people's live in 
la here.

460
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,770
So there's just not that many hunters.
You know,

461
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:44,604
a small percentage of them are hunters.
So there's nobody to control all these 

462
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:47,994
number of non native species.
And that's from a water buffalo to the 

463
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,530
fallow deer that I was hunting to 
stagger.

464
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,870
There's not as many stags is fallow 
deer,

465
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,850
but um,
all these species just,

466
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,150
there's no measure for control really.
Yeah.

467
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:06,000
And they brought in a bunch of other non
native species to,

468
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,433
it's a,
it's an exercise in conservation gone 

469
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,530
totally wrong because they brought in 
Katz to take care of certain animals and

470
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:14,364
they brought in Fox and then the Fox and
the cats are out of control and they 

471
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:18,084
kill all the ground nesting birds.
And now it's Kinda fucked up to us here 

472
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:25,530
in America.
But people in Australia hunt cats,

473
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,650
they,
them the way in the hold 'em up.

474
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:29,101
Like,
look,

475
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,050
I got one and yeah,
it's a cat.

476
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,080
Yeah,
it's weird.

477
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,170
It's like,
that's fluffy with the fuck.

478
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,881
Yeah,
no,

479
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:37,410
I,
we saw a guy and uh,

480
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,390
he had a rifle and he's walking on the 
road.

481
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,630
They're just to,
uh,

482
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,790
he lives there,
you know,

483
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:42,181
I mean,
that's,

484
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,070
his home has lived here his whole life,
I think.

485
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,250
And he was walking on the,
on the road.

486
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,670
I went down there,
I had my bowel and I,

487
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,501
you know,
I said,

488
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,490
hey,
what are you after?

489
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,360
And he's like,
aw,

490
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:51,841
man,
after,

491
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,970
uh,
a big black cat.

492
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,730
And I'm like,
uh,

493
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,630
like,
uh,

494
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,220
just a regular cat.
He's like,

495
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:00,054
yeah.
I said like,

496
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,500
just a feral,
you know,

497
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,730
wild cat.
He's like,

498
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:03,930
yeah,
it's a black one though.

499
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:04,764
He goes,
so there's a $10 bounty on it that the 

500
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,343
property owners around their head,
if he'd make kill this black cat is 10 

501
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:11,754
bucks,
but they don't think anything about it 

502
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:16,680
because there's just wild cats 
everywhere.

503
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,120
How weird is that?
Yeah.

504
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:21,360
It is bounty on a kitty cat.
Well,

505
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,380
people,
um,

506
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,620
that have researched it in America,
just in North America,

507
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,980
a cats kill somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 3 billion birds a year.

508
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,540
Yeah.
Billion.

509
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,420
Yeah.
That when they found that out,

510
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,880
like apparently like scientists were 
shocked.

511
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:43,881
The biologists were shocked is between 
1.5 and three point something billion.

512
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,190
And that's not even counting like mice 
and rabbits.

513
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,970
All the other shit.
They killed squirrels.

514
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,980
I'll never forget,
I had a cap.

515
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,330
They used to.
Um,

516
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,630
I used to live across street from this 
park and uh,

517
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,990
I had this one male cat and he was just 
a murderer.

518
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,273
And uh,
I'll never forget watching him walk 

519
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,040
across this a park with a squirrel 
between his legs.

520
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,350
So he was biting down the squirrels 
neck,

521
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,433
the squirrels dead,
and the squirrel was his size 

522
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:14,000
practically,
and it was in between his leg.

523
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,970
So He's straddling it and walking with 
it,

524
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:18,010
dragging it along so you could show it 
to me.

525
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,510
Oh,
he was super psyched.

526
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,740
That was awesome.
He was like,

527
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:21,820
Dude,
look what I got.

528
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,650
That's probably a large percentage of 
his weight right there.

529
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:29,460
He was.
It was probably no bullshit.

530
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,020
At least three quarters the size of him.
Yes.

531
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,570
It wasn't a big cat and it was a fat 
fucking squirrel.

532
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,763
Yeah.
That,

533
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,450
that probably would've been a nice 
battle.

534
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,993
It's just weird.
The adverse squirrel cats are the 

535
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:43,840
weirdest animals man,
because they're cool with us,

536
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:45,790
but they're straight killers.
I know.

537
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,100
But the only story I remember about a 
cat,

538
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,140
I can't remember where I heard it or who
told me,

539
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:52,090
but that,
oh,

540
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,310
maybe it was one of my cop friends.
But anyway,

541
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:55,630
if,
uh,

542
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,463
if,
uh,

543
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,710
like an old say it's an elderly person 
that has a dog,

544
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,610
they die.

545
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,180
The dog is that people come and find the
body that,

546
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,960
and the dog's laying there with them.
You know,

547
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:08,050
just like a loyal whatever.
And uh,

548
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,290
if a cat,
if they have a cat and they die,

549
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,780
the cat eats our eyelids and,
and lips.

550
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,830
Yeah.
Right away.

551
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,630
If you stop feeding that cat,
the cat's like,

552
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:19,600
look,
I'm eating it looked like knits owner.

553
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,380
Yup.
Yeah,

554
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,213
yeah.
So that's really all you need to know 

555
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:23,530
about a cat.
They eat each other too.

556
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,630
Um,
like crazy old people.

557
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,533
Uh,
there's this one lady who was a hoarder 

558
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,713
and she had a bunch of dead cats.
She had so many cats in our house and 

559
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,240
the cats had died and so she wasn't 
feeding the cats.

560
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,860
The cats were eating the dead cat and 
Whoa.

561
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,890
Yeah,
it's hard out there.

562
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,050
It's hard out there.
Cameron Hanes,

563
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,100
imagine be a cat living with a hoarder.

564
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,710
He liked his pitch.
Doesn't even let me go out,

565
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,570
let me out of it.
Kill some birds.

566
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,433
Oh yeah.
That animals just want to be out and 

567
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:51,670
live this.
That's what we need to,

568
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,620
we need to be out in live.
I mean that,

569
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,570
that two and a half weeks I was in 
Australia.

570
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:56,900
That was,
man,

571
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,883
I took two showers a whole time.
They'd be asleep bag and it must smell 

572
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,130
good.
What a hey,

573
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,143
that's just how it goes.
That's what people are supposed to 

574
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:08,620
smell.
I couldn't even tell.

575
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,030
We're just used to it.
Yeah.

576
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,000
So,
and I've just,

577
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,830
for the viewers,
I'm a clean pr.

578
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,673
I'd take a couple of hours a day.
But you know when you're hunting that's 

579
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:18,710
just the way it goes.
But yeah,

580
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,930
we'll you wearing wool?
No I was no,

581
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:23,470
he's warm.
Oh right.

582
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,723
But like a thin layer merino actually 
keeps it cool cause you sweating it and 

583
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:29,950
he regularly teat really well,
yeah it was,

584
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,530
you know where we are hunting deer in 
New South Wales,

585
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:36,370
which is outside of Sydney.
It was actually cold at night.

586
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,760
I mean you guys are walking on like 
frozen glass.

587
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:40,091
Yeah,
yeah,

588
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,950
yeah.
There is covered with Frost.

589
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,320
But I mean it was night.
It was freezing,

590
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,310
you know,
I mean it was like 32

591
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,050
degrees.
So we were used to,

592
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,780
we thought we were going to be hunting 
and 90 to a hundred degree weather.

593
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:51,411
So,
yeah,

594
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:52,520
I didn't,
you know,

595
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:53,354
when you're laying in a sleeping bag 
that's only rated to 40 degrees in his 

596
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:59,270
32 and sleeping on the ground,
it's rough.

597
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,403
It's rough.
As you're saying that those deer were 

598
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:05,390
like super turned on to where like there
were tuned in,

599
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:09,890
like they were very skinny edge.
They've been hunted and uh,

600
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,890
you know,
they don't have lions like we have here,

601
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,420
which keeps the deer on edge,
you know,

602
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:18,050
cause we have lions are just killers,
but uh,

603
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,840
um,
they don't have a Predator like that,

604
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:25,841
but man,
it's an antelope specie and or it's a,

605
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,740
they can see so well and so fast 
reacting.

606
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,050
It's just amazing.
What are they,

607
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,460
this is a fallow deer,
right?

608
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:35,990
Yeah.
And what do they relate it to?

609
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,600
Um,
for,

610
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,500
I just said it right there.
You said an antelope,

611
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:42,140
but I'm not sure if once I said it I'm 
like,

612
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:46,130
are they so don't,
don't quote me on that.

613
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:46,964
We might have to look that one up too.
But all I know is the reason why I said 

614
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:50,294
that is because they can see,
I mean antelope and a torres for having 

615
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,750
amazing vision,
you know,

616
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:56,690
10 times what,
what humans have apparently.

617
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,920
And that's how these were,
I mean,

618
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,710
I don't know if the deer antelope or 
whatever,

619
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:05,000
but they can see extremely well.
So they were seeing you from like a long

620
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,470
ways out.
Oh you couldn't,

621
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,333
I mean there was this one buck out of 
stock and I had a cameraman with me and 

622
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:16,310
that the key for stalking animals is 
always staying in the shade.

623
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:17,803
If,
if you stay in the shade and you got 

624
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,040
Cammo on,
especially if they're in the sun,

625
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,780
you know how it is looking,
looking into,

626
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:24,614
if you're in the sun,
he tried to look into a house you can't 

627
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,390
see.

628
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,950
Right.
So it's the same thing with shadow.

629
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:29,780
So you always have mitch out of the,
well,

630
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,320
we were 330 yards away from this buck.
I was stocking,

631
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:34,154
he was feeding in this creek and we had 
this small patch of sunlight to cross 

632
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,300
330 yards away.
It's a long way away.

633
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,260
And I told the camera,
man,

634
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:45,140
I'm like,
we just got to get across here.

635
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:47,780
Just stay low and get,
you know,

636
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,910
hustle through there.
So we hunched over and got in seconds.

637
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:54,890
We were through there,
got to the shade,

638
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,260
looked over at the buck.
He standing there staring.

639
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,910
I'm like,
are you kidding me?

640
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,420
How He's already,
so we're in the shade.

641
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:04,670
So then for sure we weren't moving.
I'm like,

642
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:06,440
don't move.
And he's just staring,

643
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,480
staring,
staring and staring.

644
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,770
And I'm like,
don't move.

645
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,633
He's like,
I'm not,

646
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,410
I go,
don't move.

647
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:13,244
He's,
he's on.

648
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,710
He's just looking.
Anything is going to spook them.

649
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,850
He's like,
I'm not moving.

650
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,880
And he was crouched down on his knees.
And so finally the buck like took a few,

651
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,280
uh,
um,

652
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,220
bites or grass and I'm like,
okay,

653
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:30,260
he's feeding.
Next thing gone.

654
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,320
So all he did is took a couple bites of 
grass for the road.

655
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,761
He's like,
no,

656
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:37,370
I already know about a year,
but I'm taking this with me.

657
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,020
And he was gone.
That was it.

658
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,783
Yeah,
they're smart.

659
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,040
That's long rifle range.
We had bows.

660
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,970
It's just a barely this.
So,

661
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,220
and we have to get close with a bow.
And so you can imagine it just if that,

662
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:53,040
that one example tells you what it was 
like basically.

663
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,710
So we were talking about um,
different,

664
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,150
both setups,
like you had brought to both setups.

665
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,560
He brought one for deer and you bought 
one for Buffalo.

666
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:07,540
So for people that don't understand,
there's two different ways that you were

667
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:08,374
going to approach this.
The buffalo is a giant heavy boned 

668
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,570
animals.
He had a real heavy Arrow,

669
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,980
which is going to go slower and those 
hours are just too slow for those deer.

670
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:20,640
And the deer would actually move out of 
the way before the Arab.

671
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

672
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,510
Like Matrix,
it,

673
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,660
it Wa it was,
you know,

674
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,020
the,
the thing with penetration with an Arrow

675
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,883
is weight.
The way to the Arrow equates to more 

676
00:27:32,471 --> 00:27:33,304
penetration with heavy bone.
And you know that we talked about the 

677
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:39,820
buffalo 1800 to 2000 pounds.
So you need something that hits hard.

678
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,670
Well,
when you have a heavier Arrow,

679
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,653
it's gonna fly slower.
So those were flying at 245 feet a 

680
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:49,420
second out of my high poundage.
Bo and I thought,

681
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,160
well,
good enough.

682
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,240
I mean,
I didn't,

683
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,910
these will be all right.
And I was shooting it so well.

684
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:56,170
I'm so accurate,
you know,

685
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:58,660
practicing not to 90 yards all the time.
She didn't really well.

686
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,310
So I thought,
you know what?

687
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,950
I know it's supposed to be for Buffalo,
I'm just going to use it for deer.

688
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:03,784
So the first week there I tried it for 
deer and it was just like these deer 

689
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,020
were seemingly 10 yards away,
but having the Arrow got two minutes.

690
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,880
I'm not talking a long shots.
And I'm like,

691
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,710
okay,
maybe it was just a fluke,

692
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,390
just a flu.
They would see it,

693
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,523
hear it,
they would hear it and they would duck 

694
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:21,280
out of the way or just be gone.
I mean,

695
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:24,400
just like be 10 yards away.
So they would move out of the way before

696
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:25,430
the area got to them.
Yeah.

697
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:26,920
Yeah.
And uh,

698
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,750
so the finally I thought,
well maybe it's just in a super calm.

699
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,460
They're so,
so quiet.

700
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,353
You know,
I don't know my bose or quiet a heavy 

701
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:37,330
arrow.
It makes a bow even quieter,

702
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,770
you know,
it absorbs that sound.

703
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,210
And the energy.
So your limbs aren't just like that.

704
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:44,044
There is more of like an,
but it still makes an always on a super 

705
00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:50,770
calm windless day,
especially when it's cold,

706
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,783
you know?
I mean it's just that sound's going to 

707
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:53,584
get across her.

708
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,630
So I thought,
well maybe it's just a fluke.

709
00:28:55,631 --> 00:28:59,440
Maybe the deer were pick something up,
pickup some movement.

710
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:02,890
So they were just on me and is whatever.
And I'm not worried about it,

711
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:04,300
you know,
I'm not used to missing,

712
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:05,134
I'm used to be very disciplined on my 
shots and taking high percentage shots 

713
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:13,450
that relaxed animals.
If I do do my stock right,

714
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,523
my,
my goal is always to shoot an animal 

715
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,330
that has no idea on there,
you know,

716
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:21,990
so it's relaxed.
And uh,

717
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,550
so that wasn't happening here and I 
thought,

718
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:26,890
well maybe,
maybe it's just because they're high,

719
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,510
strong and,
and they were on me.

720
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,910
So what would the,
the,

721
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,760
the time where I decided,
okay,

722
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,280
these arrows aren't going to work,
was a wild boar.

723
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:38,770
Was out there,
big boar,

724
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,960
45 yards.
Okay,

725
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,920
this should be

726
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,990
slam dunk money.
And I co camera over my shoulder.

727
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:48,850
He had no idea.
We were there.

728
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,260
Drawback,
shoot.

729
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,660
And he had,
he was facing,

730
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,533
uh,
his head to the left and he was heading 

731
00:29:55,661 --> 00:30:00,580
back to the right probably a few feet 
away by the time the Arrow got there.

732
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,140
Well,
I didn't even have to even,

733
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,870
I like shot and went,
Oh man,

734
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,590
are you kidding me?
Is that gone?

735
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:09,230
That fast spun and just gone.
And so then at that time I,

736
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,911
Mike,
okay,

737
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:11,500
these,
this is not going to work.

738
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,590
It's so crazy because although there's 
no predators,

739
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:18,790
they're the hunters that are there are 
out there all the time.

740
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:20,200
They don't have a season.
No,

741
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,063
there's no season sees.
Animals are just tuned in there hunting 

742
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,850
every day.
Wow.

743
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,280
Yeah.
And so it mostly rifle.

744
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,570
So I mean,
they're used to,

745
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,763
if they see somebody that's like a 
danger because they've been shot at 

746
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:34,660
from,
you know,

747
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:35,590
hundreds of yards.

748
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,200
So it's just,
yeah,

749
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:39,700
it was,
it was challenging.

750
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,541
Um,
but,

751
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,160
so I,
I changed from those,

752
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,610
uh,
245 grain arrows and I thought,

753
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:46,960
well,
I need to shoot my,

754
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:48,700
uh,
or not 245,

755
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:49,534
245 feet per second.
That's 687 green arrow to a lighter 

756
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:53,501
arrow.
And I thought,

757
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:55,660
well maybe this will do it.
And uh,

758
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,570
you know,
is it shooting 300 feet per second?

759
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:00,910
At that time did you change products?
Yup.

760
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,460
Did you go to the tow car?
No.

761
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,290
You step with the solids?
No,

762
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,250
I shot a with above flow.
And actually,

763
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,313
you know,
it's funny actually what I ended up 

764
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:14,980
killing the deer with two was uh,
um,

765
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,610
what were the magnus stingers and I also
the,

766
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,250
but they expand.
I had that expandable head.

767
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:22,930
Do you remember that one that I used on 
the bear?

768
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,770
It was a grave digger grave digger.
Yeah.

769
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,723
Yeah.

770
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,860
That'll ruthless name that head and 
that,

771
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,780
that had flies so good.
Oh,

772
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,630
is money.
So use that as well.

773
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,270
Yep.
So when you're out there man,

774
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,880
like,
so you're around Sydney,

775
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,430
which is where people are.
There's,

776
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,070
there's those animals are hunted pretty,
pretty regularly,

777
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,103
but then you're taking that flight for 
four and a half hours and then a 

778
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:49,564
helicopter.
And when you're in the area where the 

779
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:53,380
buffalo are,
there's nobody out there.

780
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,940
No,
it's remote.

781
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,310
That is a wild,
wild place.

782
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,640
When you think about the,
the size of Australia,

783
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:04,390
the size of North America with the same 
amount of people as Los Angeles,

784
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:08,620
but the area where you're at,
it's like that is as wild as it gets.

785
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,750
Yeah.
I mean w w you fly those four and a half

786
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:11,584
hour from Sydney to Darwin and most of 
that there you're looking down at 

787
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,200
country with nothing.
Nothing,

788
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,960
no roads,
no nothing.

789
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,070
And,
and that's,

790
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,993
that's a large majority of Australia is 
like that and it's just overrun with 

791
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:27,520
Buffalo.
Yeah.

792
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,630
A lot of it is.
Yep.

793
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,940
And uh,
what's crazy punch.

794
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,700
Yeah.
And that we did find some,

795
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,070
uh,
you know,

796
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,210
some drawings up there too.
Um,

797
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,160
from the,
from,

798
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,063
yeah.
I mean

799
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,790
all the natives.
Yeah.

800
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,190
Yeah.
For the aborigines.

801
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,143
And did you,
did you know that those were there 

802
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:48,070
before you went there to doubt them?
Know that there were the pilot,

803
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,100
the pilot?
No.

804
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,690
Yeah.
So we wanted to go see him.

805
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,650
Oh Wow.
So are they in a cave like where they're

806
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,040
on?
Um,

807
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,241
the,
for the,

808
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,074
whether or not to get to them,
it has to be on like the underside of a 

809
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:02,120
rock where we went and we filmed under 
there.

810
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:02,954
It was like,
you could imagine people getting out of 

811
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:09,190
the rain there and they're huge boulders
and they're getting,

812
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,630
and it was just a perfect spot to stay 
dry.

813
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,580
And so that's,
if the rain was,

814
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,640
if they drew on a part of the rock where
the rain was hitting,

815
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:18,770
obviously it was gone.
But in these,

816
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,270
these areas,
they were protected.

817
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,650
So drawings were still there.

818
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,260
Last Time Adam was here,
he talked about,

819
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,670
um,
some of the aborigines there and explain

820
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,390
some stuff.
But when we went back to my house,

821
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,081
we,
uh,

822
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:30,914
we had dinner and we sat around talking 
and he told me some crazy stories about 

823
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,390
the horrors if those people face and how
they had been wiped out.

824
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,253
Like they had been poisoned.
Like he went to this one cave and he 

825
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,180
found bones all through this cave.
He's like,

826
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,014
this is crazy.
There's like human bones and he's like 

827
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,250
children's bones.
You'd find children's bones.

828
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,533
And then he had heard this story from 
one of the other aborigines that live 

829
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:54,734
there,
that someone had brought food to all 

830
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:57,854
these people,
all the aborigines there and just 

831
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,310
poisoned the food and just killed them 
all off.

832
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:02,660
Yeah.
It's,

833
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,220
it's fucking dark.
Yeah.

834
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,050
It's dark.
No,

835
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,740
I dunno.
So they don't know.

836
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,013
They don't know who made those 
hieroglyphs are there or the cave 

837
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:13,220
drawings or whatever.

838
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,720
They weren't.
Or when they did it either.

839
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,820
Now,
now they say,

840
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,683
uh,
I put it up on my instagram page and I 

841
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:21,044
saw some comments there.
And they're saying that the more 

842
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:25,460
brightly colored,
the older they are.

843
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,350
Huh.
But I don't know.

844
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,460
I think,
I think the pilot mentioned 10,000 years

845
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:32,294
old.
Maybe.

846
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,490
I was just guessing the Flexi.
No,

847
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,640
I have no idea.
I think you just threw that out there.

848
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,310
How would you know?
I mean it's just something,

849
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,290
I'm sure somebody knows.
I mean,

850
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,370
right.
That studies that,

851
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,233
I'm sure this is probably a few people.
It seems like when you think about the 

852
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:50,360
actual numbers of how much land you're 
talking about,

853
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,450
how few people live out there and how 
many of those things are probably there.

854
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,493
And also one of the things that Adam was
telling me that's crazy as you could 

855
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,870
have,
the way,

856
00:34:57,871 --> 00:35:00,200
um,
they refer to themselves,

857
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,060
uh,
like a aborigines.

858
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,370
They call themselves a mob like,
and no,

859
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,650
instead of a tribe,
it's a mob and they're like,

860
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:09,080
there could be one mob.
And he said there could be a mob.

861
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,590
He goes full kilometers away and they 
speak a totally different language.

862
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,101
Oh,
right.

863
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:14,810
Yeah.
Like what I go,

864
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:15,980
how many languages are there?
He goes,

865
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,660
oh,
hundreds what?

866
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,920
Yeah,
hundreds.

867
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,300
I go,
so they can't talk to each other.

868
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:21,134
He goes,
nope.

869
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,580
Yeah,
no written language.

870
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,503
Yeah.
They,

871
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,180
they have different expressions for 
things.

872
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

873
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:29,210
I heard that too.
That's crazy.

874
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,910
I know what I mean.
It's really,

875
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,590
it's like a tribal society,
right?

876
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,570
I mean,
that's just the way it goes.

877
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,171
Well,
it's,

878
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:38,580
it is like a tribal society,
but it's also like you're,

879
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:40,260
you're,
I mean,

880
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:45,290
right now there's culture and there's a 
civilization that is linked to who knows

881
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:49,590
how many hundreds,
if not thousands of years ago,

882
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,400
and it will go away because there won't 
be people that understand it.

883
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,180
There's not,
no,

884
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,800
not someone who is studying it.
Yeah.

885
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,873
And there's so many different versions 
of the way they communicate that it's 

886
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:00,264
just like you're,
you're literally watching history 

887
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,741
dissolve,
right?

888
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:02,810
Yeah.

889
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,643
In front of you.
Yeah.

890
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,260
Yeah.
I know.

891
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,070
It's a,
it's a Ma,

892
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,910
it was amazing to be in that country 
walking in hunting in the same that,

893
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,130
that they have for,
you know,

894
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,510
however many years.

895
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,573
And what did they hunt back then?
Because this is obviously before the 

896
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:19,600
buffalo came in,
before they brought the fallow deer,

897
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,463
I dunno.
Just whatever wallabies or while he's a 

898
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,410
native thing.
Kangaroos and she,

899
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:25,244
yeah,
yeah.

900
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,100
Wow.
Yeah.

901
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,190
But it was,
it was cool

902
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,480
being under that rock and,
and envisioning them being there too.

903
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,900
Yeah.
You know,

904
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,300
that long ago doing the same thing we 
were doing.

905
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,450
That's,
that's a,

906
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,293
that's a real mind blower man.
It's just so fascinating thinking about 

907
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:44,184
that.
That particular continent of Australia 

908
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,293
that no,
Europe used it as a prison colony in 

909
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:52,110
England.
Brought a bunch of people over there and

910
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:52,411
go,
look,

911
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,180
you people are assholes.
Stay here.

912
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,690
Dell is on,
there's an island off of Australia,

913
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:59,280
right.
That they used for that.

914
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,500
Well they used Australia for that.
I thought,

915
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,080
Oh God,
what was that island?

916
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:06,300
I know we were doing an island as well 
that they still do.

917
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:08,160
I think that's what they tell 
immigrants.

918
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,030
Right?
Yeah.

919
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,863
And they have to live there for a 
certain amount of time before they can 

920
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:12,690
come over.
Yeah.

921
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:15,330
They have some weird immigration laws in
Australia,

922
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:16,164
Australia.
Like if people that are complaining 

923
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:22,200
about trump wanting to build a wall,
listen clearly island way worse and it's

924
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,570
like a prison.
Yeah.

925
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,890
If,
if I understand it right,

926
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:27,840
it's like a prison,
then they have to stay there for,

927
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,471
you know,
like I said,

928
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:30,660
a certain amount of time before they're 
a citizen.

929
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,090
Yeah.
See if you could find that Jimmy,

930
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,933
Josh zips actually brought it up to us 
and he was explaining how brutal the 

931
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,273
immigration laws are over there.
They don't want to anybody moving to 

932
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:41,310
Australia,
they understand.

933
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,960
They have a good thing going on.
Yeah.

934
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,050
I mean if you haven't been to Australia,
it is lovely.

935
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,320
People there are fantastic.
They're super friendly.

936
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,450
They're really nice.
And again,

937
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:54,630
there's not that many of them.
It's expensive though.

938
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,620
Yeah.
Very.

939
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:57,480
You know,
I mean there was a,

940
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,300
um,
amen.

941
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,070
He,
I think his house was like a two bedroom

942
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,680
house,
four or $500,000.

943
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,970
Wow.
Yeah.

944
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,680
Yeah.
It makes sense though.

945
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:09,180
You got to bring shit over there,
right?

946
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,650
Yeah.

947
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,170
They were saying the guy,
uh,

948
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,960
when I was in Sydney,
um,

949
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,093
the guy who driving us,
I was telling us how much cars costs 

950
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:17,880
over there.
They cost so much more money,

951
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,020
especially like people,
like a classic American muscle cars.

952
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,440
And the guy was talking about how much 
like a 1968 mustang was worth.

953
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,753
And he's like,
it's probably worth twice what it's 

954
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,650
worth in a merrily.
Yeah,

955
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:30,360
because they have to ship them over 
there.

956
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,580
What they have over there,
which is sweet,

957
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,150
was a Toyota high lux diesel trucks.
Those are pretty sweet.

958
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,013
What is it?
It's just a Toyota Tundra as it like a 

959
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:41,890
ton.
Like a,

960
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,780
it's like a,
they call it a ute.

961
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,520
That's a pickup.
Oh,

962
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,140
okay.
Utility vehicle.

963
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,190
I don't know.
Yeah,

964
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,020
I dunno.
I'm just trying to use it.

965
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,913
Learn the lingo.
But a ute is a pickup and it was a 

966
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,020
Toyota high lux diesel.

967
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,150
And is this what Adam was driving around
in?

968
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,580
No,
I can't remember what his is.

969
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,810
I heard is right there,
Huh?

970
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,790
Yeah,
that's a,

971
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,650
okay,
so it's like a flat bed.

972
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,300
Yeah.
Hmm.

973
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,250
I'm not sure what happened.
Maybe Adam has that.

974
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:10,084
I can't remember now.
One of the things that I thought was 

975
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:12,034
weird when I was there,
it was how many people have snorkels on 

976
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:14,681
their trucks?
Yeah.

977
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:15,514
Yeah.
That one right there that's driving 

978
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:17,890
through water.
Well,

979
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:20,080
it's not just water,
it's also dust.

980
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,973
Elderly chokes up your air filters.
So I have those things way up high so 

981
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:29,110
that it a,
when the engine's getting the air,

982
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:32,770
like apparently it mitigates a lot of 
the dust cause a lot of the dust is like

983
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,850
a headlight.
Hi.

984
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,713
Yeah.
When you're driving and that gets you a 

985
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:39,670
little bit more clear air there.
Well that's out of my wheelhouse.

986
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,990
I know bow hunt down and running.
Well you knew the name of it.

987
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,450
No,
I just noticed because they're cool.

988
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,640
Well whenever you go to like Africa,
yeah.

989
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,040
Whenever we go someplace that's fucking 
brutal.

990
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,930
You see a lot of toyotas.
Yeah.

991
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,770
Toyota's know how to,
they know how to make a car that lasts.

992
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,340
Do they do that?
They're not.

993
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,640
I mean here it's just like,
you know Ford,

994
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:02,050
Chevy,
you know.

995
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:03,970
I Dunno cause we were like American 
stuff.

996
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,040
I guess so,
yeah.

997
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,510
But still you still see a lot of like 
old land cruisers?

998
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,593
Yeah.
I mean how many Fj cruiser there where 

999
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:14,020
we were on in the outback driving 
around.

1000
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,490
Everybody has those.
Yeah.

1001
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,800
Every person has a truck set up like 
that?

1002
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,740
Well I guess you have to.
Yeah.

1003
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,633
If you realize after time,
like this is the only thing that makes 

1004
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:24,580
it,
yeah,

1005
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,390
cause Adam was saying when he drives 
from Sydney to Darwin,

1006
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:30,640
he know we took a four and a half hour 
plane flight,

1007
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,750
but it's three days.

1008
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,183
So he have to have,
your rig has to be bulletproof 

1009
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,260
basically.
Yeah.

1010
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:39,094
They have an expression.
You could take a range rover into the 

1011
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:42,244
bush,
but you need a land rover to get out of 

1012
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:44,200
the bush.
Is that right?

1013
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,880
Okay.
Yeah.

1014
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,950
They just,
those toyotas.

1015
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,023
It's just,
it's kinda crazy how well they last and 

1016
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,800
when you really think about like for the
longest time America did a real shit job

1017
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:57,634
of making cars that last,
there's was a period in American cars 

1018
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,413
from like the 1970s till I think till 
probably like the late nineties a 2000 

1019
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:07,114
they finally got it right.
And now we make very dependable cars as 

1020
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:10,654
well.
But for the longest time we were making 

1021
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,590
dog shit.
Well,

1022
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,503
I don't know about all that,
but I do know we're going to go up and 

1023
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:19,804
do that.
Hunter,

1024
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,003
me,
you and Adam and we're going to do a 

1025
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,820
netflix special.
They don't,

1026
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:27,280
Netflix has a plan.
Netflix doesn't know this yet.

1027
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,061
Why?
Why,

1028
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:29,050
why Netflix?
What?

1029
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,680
What makes you a little,
well,

1030
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,380
it's good move.
It's a good move.

1031
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,040
I want to do something

1032
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,890
on the Internet.
Yeah.

1033
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:39,910
I want her to be like an hour long 
documentary style fam hunting film,

1034
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,870
giving back,
you know,

1035
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,050
killing Buffalo,
taking the meat back to the community.

1036
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,900
Does the natives.
Yeah.

1037
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,930
Yeah.
To aborigines.

1038
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,220
Yeah.
That's what I envision.

1039
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,710
That sounds like a great idea.
It could be,

1040
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,460
certainly it could be done on Netflix or
it could be done and you can just put it

1041
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,570
online.
Yeah,

1042
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,040
that,
that could be just as,

1043
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:58,874
I mean Netflix is awesome for sure,
but there's some people that don't have 

1044
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:04,880
netflix.
Everybody has an online connection.

1045
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,420
Yeah.
My,

1046
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,253
my,
my goal is to sort of use you cause 

1047
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,893
people,
because I wanna I wanna I want hunting 

1048
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:17,600
to be shown and the light that I know it
to be,

1049
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:18,643
which is hard work,
respect for the country and the animals 

1050
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,723
and giving back.
So with you involved more people care 

1051
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:26,780
about it.

1052
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,870
Right.
And we want to have you involved because

1053
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:30,704
we like hanging out with you and like,
well I was explaining this to Adam to 

1054
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,383
um,
when we did my podcast up there in the 

1055
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:39,640
bush is like,
ever since I,

1056
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:40,474
I've hunted way back when Roy moved to 
Alaska and I was left hunting a 

1057
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,900
wilderness on my own.
I loved it so much.

1058
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,650
I kept wanting to find somebody who 
would love it as much as I,

1059
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,410
so I could say,
look how awesome this is.

1060
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,273
Isn't this awesome?
And I kept taking people there and try 

1061
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:01,430
to convince them how awesome it was.
It wasn't awesome for them.

1062
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:02,803
So it was like,
but you want to share something that 

1063
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:09,080
impacts you so much with other people 
who appreciate it.

1064
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,213
So that's why that's,
that's what I was saying when Adam I 

1065
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:16,160
were talking is that,
you know,

1066
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:16,994
you love bow hunting and so that's when,
when you are so interested in invested 

1067
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,760
in something and have such a passion for
something,

1068
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,713
there's nothing better when somebody's 
then when somebody else shares that 

1069
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:26,660
passion.
Right.

1070
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,180
Yeah.
So that,

1071
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,023
that was,
that was why there's a few different 

1072
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:31,880
reasons why you were going to be 
involved.

1073
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,860
Thank you.
I'm excited about that.

1074
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,410
I also think the difficulty factor is 
what turns people off.

1075
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,390
I don't think they expect it to be so 
difficult.

1076
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:40,690
No,
no,

1077
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,523
no.
If you try to introduce bow hunting to 

1078
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:43,390
people,
first of all,

1079
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,850
just shooting a bow,
people think,

1080
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,440
oh well we'll see you pull the string 
back.

1081
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:49,000
You pointed the spot,
you'll let it go.

1082
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,820
Good luck with all that.
It takes some fucking years.

1083
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,100
It takes years to get competent with a 
ball.

1084
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,091
And,
uh,

1085
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:55,924
I remember when you first started 
showing me how to shoot when we first 

1086
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:04,750
shot in my backyard.
And I immediately recognized,

1087
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:07,960
I think like after,
first of all you've got a 90 pound bow,

1088
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:09,480
which I definitely shouldn't have been 
pulling back.

1089
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,860
My shoulder was fucking killing me after
the first hour.

1090
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,333
Like this takes,
you got to build up to this God damn 

1091
00:44:16,241 --> 00:44:17,074
thing.
But then I remember thinking like to be 

1092
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:22,150
accurate with this,
like I just went down a rabbit hole.

1093
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,273
I'm like,
I just took my first step down a crazy 

1094
00:44:25,301 --> 00:44:30,100
rabbit hole and who knows where it leads
because this is not easy and I'm a,

1095
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:35,101
I have a very addictive yeah.
And I need to figure out ways to channel

1096
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:36,354
that addiction in positive ways cause I 
can get lost doing things that are not 

1097
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:43,410
good.
So bow hunting and archery itself.

1098
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,820
To me it seemed like,
okay,

1099
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,460
this is a discipline.
It's a worthy pursuit.

1100
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:49,810
It's fascinating and I'm very,
very interested in it.

1101
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,090
But for a lot of people I think it's 
very daunting.

1102
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,750
Like,
oh,

1103
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,583
I don't think they realize it.
People think of hunting is like elmer 

1104
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,520
fudd.
Like you know,

1105
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:03,990
you'd go out there or they see some 
hunting scene in a movie where there's a

1106
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:04,824
bunch of rednecks and they're fat and 
they're was sitting in a tree stand or 

1107
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:07,860
something like that.

1108
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,753
And they think it's easy and they think 
it's a bunch of people that are just 

1109
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:15,561
killing animals and they don't care.
And then when you actually go out and do

1110
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:17,250
it,
especially if you go do it with a person

1111
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:18,084
like you,
you understand what this thing really 

1112
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:21,210
is.
And what it really is,

1113
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:22,044
is this incredibly difficult pursuit 
that takes immense amounts of hard work 

1114
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:30,810
and dedication and you gotta be in 
fucking shape for it.

1115
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,260
And this is something that people are 
starting to realize now,

1116
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,593
and I think you're a big part of this,
and over the last few years and all the 

1117
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:38,814
platforms that you've gone on to tell 
your story is that people understand 

1118
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:42,984
that big game hunting in the West and 
the western style hunting elk and mule 

1119
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:50,880
deer,
the type of stuff that you love to do is

1120
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,160
very,
very difficult.

1121
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,930
It is a combination of athletics,
of extreme endurance,

1122
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,340
of hiking,
outdoorsmen ship survival skills,

1123
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,500
and then the knowledge of hunting.

1124
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,510
And then you have to be a good shot on 
top of all that.

1125
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,960
You have to know archery.
Yeah.

1126
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,630
Then you have to be able to keep,
you know,

1127
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:12,000
with that adrenaline hits all of a 
sudden.

1128
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,653
And that's what's hard is people have 
invested so much into it and they've 

1129
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:17,930
been thinking about the,
the Mo,

1130
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,620
the crunch time for so long that when it
happens it's too much.

1131
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:23,823
Yeah.
So it's really hard when you've been 

1132
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:28,530
thinking about something for years 
potentially,

1133
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:30,690
or at least all year,
you know that,

1134
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:31,890
oh,
here's my chance,

1135
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:34,350
here's my chance.
And then you get it and you're not ready

1136
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:38,010
yet because it's just too much to,
it's so hard to stay calm.

1137
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,023
Well,
it's also something that you need to do 

1138
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,600
a bunch of times until you understand 
it.

1139
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,180
It's like,
I try to explain it to people about,

1140
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,950
we were talking about fighting earlier.

1141
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,450
We were talking about,
um,

1142
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,793
when Pete,
if someone has never fought before and 

1143
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:53,540
never competed before,
the,

1144
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,433
the scary thing is not really the,
what's nerve racking is not the actual 

1145
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:01,470
fighting itself.
Once the fighting starts,

1146
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,520
you're actually kind of like just in the
zone and you're just doing it.

1147
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,630
I mean,
you might be intimidated,

1148
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:07,464
especially if you're fighting a guy like
Mike Tyson or Anderson Silva or 

1149
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,860
something like that.
You're going to be shitting your pants.

1150
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,830
But the real terrifying stuff is the 
buildup,

1151
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:14,783
the lead up.
And that's kind of the same thing with 

1152
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:20,220
hunting.
It's the moment before the shot.

1153
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:21,323
It's your adrenaline is pumping.
It's like if you had a shoot an eight 

1154
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:29,260
ball across the table,
long shot and your life was on the line,

1155
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:32,230
it's almost like that.
And you don't get any warm up shots.

1156
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,690
There's no warmup shots.
Just all of a sudden,

1157
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,990
here's this one shot for all the marbles
and you've got to stay calm.

1158
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,380
Okay.
Oh,

1159
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,040
and the animals might be moving.
Yeah.

1160
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,580
Like,
Oh fuck no.

1161
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,730
I was saying that on this last hunt.
It was,

1162
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,010
you know,
we had me,

1163
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:52,490
Adam and remy warrant and supposedly 
we're supposed to be pretty good hunter,

1164
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:56,760
the best of the best and we were 
struggling to get something killed.

1165
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,170
And I was just like imagine how 
frustrating this would be for somebody,

1166
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,633
a new hunter.
I mean it's no wonder people try to bow 

1167
00:48:04,951 --> 00:48:07,440
hunt and then just be like,
are you kidding me?

1168
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,720
This is impossible.
And it's,

1169
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,090
but it's,
it's that challenge.

1170
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,280
Anyway,
it's that whole journey,

1171
00:48:14,281 --> 00:48:17,710
which is why I want to do that special 
and I want,

1172
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,653
I want to share all of us positive about
hunting it to as many people as you 

1173
00:48:22,531 --> 00:48:23,364
know.
And we are reaching new people these 

1174
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,350
days.
You know what I mean?

1175
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,020
Hunting,
it's,

1176
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:30,000
it's in the cross hairs in some aspects 
I guess.

1177
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,270
But we're also other people are getting,
cause I get,

1178
00:48:33,271 --> 00:48:36,900
I mean I went to an archery shop up 
there,

1179
00:48:36,901 --> 00:48:41,901
Benson's archery in Sydney and we just 
had a few hours notice saying,

1180
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,544
Hey Adam,
Adam and I are going to stop by swing 

1181
00:48:46,141 --> 00:48:47,940
by,
and quite a few people came.

1182
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,500
I mean,
it was,

1183
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,580
it was surprising how many people showed
up,

1184
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,480
but a lot of them were vegetarians,
you know,

1185
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,060
six months ago,
listen to your show.

1186
00:48:57,061 --> 00:48:58,440
A lot of people told me,
Oh,

1187
00:48:58,441 --> 00:49:01,620
I found out about you from Joe Rogan or 
I didn't hunt.

1188
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,600
All right,
I didn't even eat meat.

1189
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,493
And all these different stories,
all these different from all these 

1190
00:49:06,901 --> 00:49:09,960
different areas.
So we are reaching new people and I want

1191
00:49:09,961 --> 00:49:12,540
to make sure our message,
the one of,

1192
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,433
of,
of respect and reverence and awe and 

1193
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,950
appreciation for everything out there 
and for survival and for just,

1194
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,500
you know,
outside of the life outside of the city,

1195
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:26,520
I want that shown in a way that I know 
we would.

1196
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:31,140
So that's why I'm selfishly want this to
be a big thing,

1197
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:33,780
just because I'm sick of hunting,
you know,

1198
00:49:33,781 --> 00:49:36,630
the elmer fudd thing or um,
you know,

1199
00:49:36,631 --> 00:49:37,320
I see.

1200
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,320
I was watching a movie the other day and
they showed a hunter and it was like the

1201
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:45,030
girl was on there and she was,
oh,

1202
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:45,864
what was that?
There's three girls that were kidnapped 

1203
00:49:47,161 --> 00:49:50,040
and one of them had hunted as a,
as a younger girl.

1204
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,730
And so she was like,
do you know what movie that is?

1205
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,040
Anyway,
so she was had the upper hand,

1206
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:59,280
she was tougher and she was more 
prepared because she had been a hunter.

1207
00:49:59,281 --> 00:49:59,821
And I'm like,
oh,

1208
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:00,654
that's cool.
But then they show her as a little girl 

1209
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:07,761
hunting and her perverted uncle had 
molested her hunting,

1210
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,620
drinking beer.
Oh God.

1211
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:13,890
That movie split Split.
That's what it was.

1212
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,040
So the hunter in there with some child 
molester,

1213
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,233
I'm like,

1214
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:24,630
why is the most misunderstood and 
misrepresented discipline?

1215
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,613
I think,
uh,

1216
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,160
that we have here in,
and it's,

1217
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:33,161
it's so confusing to people because when
we think of a food,

1218
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,260
we think of restaurants and we think a 
supermarket.

1219
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:37,094
Yeah.
We don't think of wild animals and the 

1220
00:50:39,951 --> 00:50:44,480
connection that people feel like they 
don't have what their food is.

1221
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:46,730
One thing that comes up all the time 
lately,

1222
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,450
so people are constantly looking for 
these farm to table places.

1223
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,350
I visit a farm to table place out here,
um,

1224
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,420
called a peddler's fork.
It's a really good place.

1225
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:58,100
They have great eggs,
like you get the eggs,

1226
00:50:58,101 --> 00:50:58,934
they were like real dark yoke and the 
food is all grass fed beef or from a 

1227
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:05,660
farm if they have a connection to and 
they buy the meat from the farm.

1228
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:08,540
And there's a lot of that,
these farm to table places where they,

1229
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,613
these restaurants have a great 
relationship with the people that 

1230
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:13,600
actually grow the food.

1231
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,820
So everything's organic.
They know where it comes from and people

1232
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:17,654
are super connected to that.
They love the idea that because factory 

1233
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:21,254
farming is kind of freaking people out.
And for the longest time it was 

1234
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:26,480
happening without us knowing.
You know,

1235
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,870
I think during the eighties and the 
nineties it was all going on and no one,

1236
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,560
no one understood.
Yup.

1237
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,850
So now people are becoming more aware 
because of the Internet,

1238
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:35,983
because of information and they're 
becoming more aware of where their food 

1239
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:40,064
comes from.
And you're also seeing a higher number 

1240
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:46,580
of people that their response to this 
factory farming thing is,

1241
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:47,331
well,
hey,

1242
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:48,530
I'll go vegetarian all,
hey,

1243
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:49,600
I'll go vegan.
And Yeah,

1244
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,370
before I hunted with Rinella,
that was my thought.

1245
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:53,204
I was like,
I don't want to participate in factory 

1246
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:55,790
farming.
Yeah.

1247
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:58,430
So what am I going to do?
I'm going to do one of two things.

1248
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,263
I can either go hunting,
I'm going to hunt for my own food 

1249
00:52:01,341 --> 00:52:03,380
because I knew there's something wrong.
I'm like,

1250
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:04,214
it's too easy to just get a steak.
I would always like pick up a steak and 

1251
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:08,050
I go,
this isn't me an animal like a,

1252
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:08,923
here I am at the supermarket now it's a 
styrofoam container wrapped in Saran 

1253
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,760
wrap.
Like this is fucking weird.

1254
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,983
It's weird that you could just do this.
So my thought was if I shoot an animal 

1255
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:19,304
and I hate it,
like I didn't know how it was going to 

1256
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,170
feel.
I never shy.

1257
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,810
I've fished all my life.
I never,

1258
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,320
but when I shot that deer and I was 
like,

1259
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:26,711
oh,
I can,

1260
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:27,980
I get it.
I get it.

1261
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,873
Yeah.
I mean it was an extreme amount of 

1262
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:31,370
respect.
It's on video.

1263
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:32,204
I mean,
you can see it on media or anybody who 

1264
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:34,450
wants to watch it.

1265
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,710
You could watch it online.
The first time I ever shot a deer,

1266
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,350
it was intense.
Yeah.

1267
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,120
You know,
and,

1268
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,970
and then cutting it up and eating it 
that night.

1269
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:42,350
I was like,
this makes sense.

1270
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,753
This is a,
and then when you actually find out 

1271
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,260
that,
you know that these animals,

1272
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:53,410
the money that co gum from hunting tags 
and even from buying hunting gear,

1273
00:52:53,661 --> 00:52:56,450
there's a percentage of money that goes 
towards conservation.

1274
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:57,523
And this is all very carefully thought 
out by people like you and by these 

1275
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:03,260
people that really respect and care for 
these animals.

1276
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,160
And you get deeper and deeper into this 
and you understand what it really is.

1277
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:07,994
And then you see this whole community of
these people like yourself and Remy 

1278
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:12,703
Warren and these hardcore hunters that 
are also like deeply connected to the 

1279
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:20,510
land and conservation and deeply 
appreciate these animals.

1280
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,870
And this is how they get all their meat.
This is how they live.

1281
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:27,060
And like that was extremely appealing to
me.

1282
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,003
Yeah,
it's uh,

1283
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:32,780
I think Steve or has done a great job 
make getting that message out in a,

1284
00:53:32,781 --> 00:53:35,480
in a,
in a perfect way really.

1285
00:53:35,481 --> 00:53:36,920
I mean,
he's a great spokesman and,

1286
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,010
and his show,
I used to watch his show before meteor.

1287
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:40,873
Now,
I can't remember what it was called 

1288
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:42,680
within.
Is that what it was?

1289
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:43,221
Yeah.
Yeah.

1290
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:43,821
Okay.
And,

1291
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:46,850
and I remember he had just something 
about him that I'm like,

1292
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,170
okay,
this is different.

1293
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,600
I liked I was a hunter.
I,

1294
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,260
you know,
I've been a hunter myself my whole life,

1295
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,094
but his,
his portrayal was different than what 

1296
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:56,810
we'd seen before.
And so,

1297
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,543
you know,
maybe the me and some of the other 

1298
00:54:00,831 --> 00:54:01,664
people you've mentioned and,
and Adam have just carried that on and 

1299
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:09,050
tried to do a good job of educating 
people who don't know any better.

1300
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,300
And I just,
you know,

1301
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:16,340
it's like,
I wish everybody could be out there.

1302
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,173
I mean,
that last day we were up in the 

1303
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:21,120
mountains there,
um,

1304
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,800
after I had killed my deer and we had a 
back strap,

1305
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:28,130
so we're picking up camp,
getting everything away.

1306
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,810
But I had,
I had,

1307
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,960
uh,
awesome fallow deer backstrap,

1308
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,720
which is like the prime for people that 
don't know as a prime cut.

1309
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:37,543
And I cut it all up.
I cleaned it all off every piece of 

1310
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:46,100
anything that was on at hair.
If there's any tree bark,

1311
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,710
anything that was on there was just a 
perfect clean piece of meat.

1312
00:54:48,711 --> 00:54:52,910
I sliced it all up.
We got a green stick to put it on.

1313
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,770
Um,
skewered it on,

1314
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:57,790
on green,
um,

1315
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,690
wood.
So if it's,

1316
00:54:59,691 --> 00:55:01,640
if it's dry wood that we'll just going 
to burn.

1317
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:02,341
And so,
you know,

1318
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,174
you can't cook on that.
So it's gotta be green and we put it 

1319
00:55:05,061 --> 00:55:08,060
over the fire there and it was,
we seasoned it,

1320
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,890
it was so good.

1321
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:13,280
It was probably some of the best meat 
I've ever eaten.

1322
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,500
And standing around the campfire,
just pulling that off,

1323
00:55:15,501 --> 00:55:16,334
that,
that stick that we had cooked it over 

1324
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:18,704
the open flame was,
I wish everybody could know what that 

1325
00:55:21,561 --> 00:55:26,561
was like to know that that deer just 
previous to that was alive in the woods.

1326
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:31,460
We harvested them,
which is Aka killed him.

1327
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,653
And then Adam and that's that circle of 
life or whatever you want to call it or 

1328
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,183
just that moment that's,
I wish everybody could experience it 

1329
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:43,070
because I just think they'd have a 
different take on,

1330
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,810
on hunter hunting and hunters and uh,
being self sustaining.

1331
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,033
It's very different.
Meat is very different when you've 

1332
00:55:50,361 --> 00:55:51,194
tilled it yourself.
It's impossible to describe without 

1333
00:55:52,821 --> 00:55:53,930
experiencing it.
I mean,

1334
00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:55,640
I could try,
I could give it my best shot,

1335
00:55:55,641 --> 00:55:56,750
but I'll,
I'll fall short.

1336
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,630
But I remember eating that meat that we 
ate,

1337
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,460
uh,
when I was in Montana with Rinella,

1338
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,383
the first hunt and uh,
it was so delicious and we're cooking 

1339
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:07,850
and over at Campfire and Steven brought 
this little grill,

1340
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:08,841
not,
not a grill,

1341
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:09,950
like a great,
you know,

1342
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:14,951
that we'd sat down over the fire and 
[inaudible] and it's like,

1343
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,360
like if you buy a steak and you cook it,
it's great.

1344
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,100
Tastes good.
Or call this a good steak.

1345
00:56:22,101 --> 00:56:24,310
This is nice.
But there's no connection

1346
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,060
there.
No,

1347
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,893
none.
When you are eating an animal that you 

1348
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,580
killed yourself and it's difficult to do
when you,

1349
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:33,640
you were hard hunting for many,
many days for you got that deer.

1350
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,503
Yeah.
So there's this intense respect and 

1351
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:40,270
connection that I think we all,
I mean,

1352
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,104
we,
we harp on about it so many times that 

1353
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:44,080
people listen to these podcasts,
that Jesus Christ,

1354
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:46,010
you go stop talking about how awesome 
hunting is,

1355
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,840
is it's because it's impacted both of us
in a very,

1356
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,880
very positive way.
In a very,

1357
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,773
uh,
there's a primal genetic sort of a 

1358
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:59,320
ancestral thing that's happening when 
you hunt.

1359
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,610
Yeah.
There's,

1360
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:03,100
there's a,
there's some lights that go off the,

1361
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:04,990
you didn't even know where they're like,
oh,

1362
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:07,510
I didn't even know there was a switch 
over there and like,

1363
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,730
oh,
this is a part of my brain that's lit up

1364
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:10,930
that it was never lit up before.

1365
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,273
And it's not,
it's not what everybody thinks that the 

1366
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:16,660
negative aspects,
it's not a barbaric thing.

1367
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,080
It's not a cruelty thing.
It's a very respectful thing.

1368
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:20,973
Yeah.
And I understand the people that have 

1369
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:25,054
bad feelings about it.
I understand the people that look at it 

1370
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:29,470
like animal cruelty.
Like you don't have to do that.

1371
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,453
You can get food other ways.
You can eat beans and you don't need to 

1372
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:35,290
do this.
I understand how they're thinking,

1373
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,800
but my thought process is very 
different.

1374
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,190
My thought process is what you're doing,
what I'm doing,

1375
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:43,024
what all these people that do that hunt 
is your entering into the wild and you 

1376
00:57:46,601 --> 00:57:49,600
are for a small window a week or 
whatever it is.

1377
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,810
You're becoming a part of this crazy 
cycle of nature.

1378
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:56,710
You're taking something out of that and 
leaving something as well.

1379
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:58,090
You're spending a ton of money.

1380
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,553
That money,
whether it's a the money for the 

1381
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:03,910
outfitters,
the money for the tags and money for the

1382
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:04,930
gear,
all that stuff.

1383
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,410
Percentage of that goes to make sure 
that the habitat is maintained.

1384
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,600
Make sure that the animal populations 
maintained,

1385
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,820
make sure that department of fishing 
game is well staffed with biologists,

1386
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:18,550
with people that are monitoring these 
animals because guess what?

1387
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:20,150
If that doesn't get done,
it's,

1388
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:22,180
it's these animals are not going to be 
there anymore,

1389
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:23,710
right?
They're not going to be taken care of.

1390
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:28,020
And North America has the best wildlife 
management program or,

1391
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,313
or management system of anywhere.
And that's why almost all the species 

1392
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:33,934
that we have here,
there's more now than there almost ever 

1393
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:38,770
has been.
And even with shrinking habitat,

1394
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:41,410
because we're encroaching on,
on where they live,

1395
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,130
but we're still the number still 
flourish because we're not,

1396
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,390
hunters aren't just,
Oh,

1397
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:47,270
let's go kill life.

1398
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,310
I'm all out.
I mean,

1399
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,050
we're,
it's managed.

1400
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:52,510
It's fishing game as managers are funded
by hunters.

1401
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,190
And what we pay that with,
uh,

1402
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,050
with the tags and license.
And so it's,

1403
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,290
there's a system to it,
but at the end of the day,

1404
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,040
like they're in Australia,
we were getting up in the morning out of

1405
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:06,430
the sleeping bag,
grabbing her bow and taken off.

1406
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:10,090
We're hunters as it and that,
that feels,

1407
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,620
man,
it,

1408
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,330
it feels,
like I said,

1409
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:14,164
I wish people could know what it feels 
like because I see people comment on my 

1410
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:19,540
social media and they saved the susans 
of the 19th century anymore.

1411
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,560
You don't have to be a neanderthal or 
whatever,

1412
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,100
but

1413
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,330
it's just,
we,

1414
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,680
we are hunters.

1415
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,833
Yeah,
well most of those people of 

1416
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:28,810
cheeseburgers and their instagram pages,
which is fucking hilarious.

1417
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,540
There's so much of that.
This one chick,

1418
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,650
she posted something mean when I posted 
a picture of some elk that I was cooking

1419
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,330
and I said,
hey honey,

1420
00:59:37,331 --> 00:59:39,220
I go,
you got like call girls honey,

1421
00:59:39,221 --> 00:59:40,660
because it makes them feel like I'm a 
sexist.

1422
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,333
You got a,
you got to fucking blt on your page 

1423
00:59:44,171 --> 00:59:45,580
sweetie.
And uh,

1424
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,421
she's like,
well,

1425
00:59:46,421 --> 00:59:49,660
that was just from four months ago 
before I was enlightened.

1426
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:50,703
I like,
Oh,

1427
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,650
you became enlightened.
It's always the most adamant vegans like

1428
00:59:53,651 --> 00:59:56,520
just became one of the most 
proselytizing,

1429
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:00,520
ruthlessly aggressive once I understand 
where they're coming from.

1430
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:01,383
And I think that's very important for,
to get our message across is that like 

1431
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:07,610
it went on animal haters.
This is not this.

1432
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,473
And it's,
it's hard for people to understand that 

1433
01:00:10,061 --> 01:00:14,080
someone could love animals and love the 
idea of animals and love wildlife,

1434
01:00:14,081 --> 01:00:14,920
but still eat them.

1435
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,021
Yeah.
You know,

1436
01:00:16,021 --> 01:00:16,650
I,
I always,

1437
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,483
I climbed up in this tree there,
I found this place where the deer were 

1438
01:00:20,941 --> 01:00:23,400
coming into this field.
And,

1439
01:00:23,401 --> 01:00:24,660
uh,
like I said,

1440
01:00:24,661 --> 01:00:25,800
this area had been hunted,
but I,

1441
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:26,723
I,
I had figured nobody had ever a hundred 

1442
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,400
out of a tree there,
you know,

1443
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,350
um,
not like a white tail back here,

1444
01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:32,184
you know,
in the,

1445
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,460
in the east or in the south,
that Theresa 100 all the time.

1446
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:36,031
So I'm like,
well,

1447
01:00:36,031 --> 01:00:39,210
I think I can get up in this tree,
these deer coming out in this area.

1448
01:00:39,211 --> 01:00:43,200
I probably have a pretty good chance.
So I was up there in the tree and,

1449
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:44,034
uh,
these doughs and Fonz or out in the 

1450
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:48,660
field and they were running around 
chasing each other plain.

1451
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:49,733
I mean,
it was just like speeding all around in 

1452
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:54,510
circles and bumping into each other.
And,

1453
01:00:54,511 --> 01:00:56,940
uh,
it was cool to see.

1454
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,790
And then this,
uh,

1455
01:00:58,830 --> 01:00:59,663
a doe and a spike,
a young buck came out right under my 

1456
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:05,550
tree.
This spike was 24,

1457
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,580
25 yards away,
basically a chip shot with a bow,

1458
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,450
especially had no idea.
I was there and I,

1459
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:15,180
there was a thought that we were getting
low on meeting camp and,

1460
01:01:15,181 --> 01:01:16,740
uh,
I hadn't killed a deer.

1461
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,330
So,
you know,

1462
01:01:18,331 --> 01:01:19,410
I had said before,
I'm like,

1463
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:21,920
I'm killing any buck that comes out.
Um,

1464
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,160
I'm,
I'm taking him.

1465
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:25,920
And then I was watching him up there and
I'm just like,

1466
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,120
I just,
you know,

1467
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,620
for me,
uh,

1468
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,410
it's gotta be the right animals,
not just like,

1469
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,570
I'm not some blood thirsty,
you know,

1470
01:01:33,571 --> 01:01:34,404
I still watch the deer.
I still appreciate their beauty and 

1471
01:01:36,581 --> 01:01:37,021
that,
you know,

1472
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:39,300
they're frolicking about or whatever you
want to call it.

1473
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,613
And it's still enjoyed that this,
this young buck was down and I had said 

1474
01:01:43,261 --> 01:01:44,760
I was,
we're going to get meat for camp,

1475
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,070
but I'm not some bloodthirsty guy.

1476
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:47,910
So I just said,
well,

1477
01:01:47,911 --> 01:01:48,744
no,
I'm just going to watch him and you 

1478
01:01:49,681 --> 01:01:50,431
know,
enjoy it.

1479
01:01:50,431 --> 01:01:52,250
And he was there.
And then the buck,

1480
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,170
I ended up killing,
stepped out.

1481
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:56,910
And uh,
you know,

1482
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:59,190
an old Bach,
he was,

1483
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:03,210
you could see his hip bones because he 
was so run down from the ride and he was

1484
01:02:03,211 --> 01:02:05,400
getting older.
I could tell he was an older,

1485
01:02:05,401 --> 01:02:06,450
mature deer.
And that's,

1486
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,313
that's what I want to take.
I want to take an animal past its prime 

1487
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,243
that has done his job for spreaders 
genes for the health of the herd and 

1488
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:17,700
was,
that's the animals we want to take out.

1489
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,670
And so he,
he was just a rundown

1490
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:23,130
old Bach.
That's why I took,

1491
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,840
yeah,
people don't they,

1492
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:25,763
that's the problem is that people 
associate someone who wants to take an 

1493
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:31,980
older big mature animal with trophy 
hunting.

1494
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:32,641
Like,
Oh,

1495
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:34,740
you just want the antler.
So you just want a big,

1496
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:36,283
but they don't understand that that is 
actually the animal that you should 

1497
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:39,024
take.
Yeah.

1498
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:41,160
And he's still a,
he's still great me.

1499
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,150
Yeah,
sure.

1500
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,820
Yeah.
But I mean that,

1501
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,030
that's just,
you know,

1502
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,240
for the health of the herd,
that's the one you want,

1503
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:49,830
you know,
if you're doing it right,

1504
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:50,381
right.
You know,

1505
01:02:50,381 --> 01:02:51,214
young ones,
then we'll get a chance to fill his 

1506
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:53,070
spot.
Right.

1507
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:56,220
And that would be the natural position 
if there was an,

1508
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,440
this is the natural position.
If there's predators,

1509
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,510
the natural position is the really young
ones,

1510
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:03,870
like the Fonz get taken out and then the
really old ones start getting worn down.

1511
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:04,703
They get taken out.
And then everything in the middle gets 

1512
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:06,864
to breed.
And then this guy who was eight years 

1513
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:09,474
old or whatever he is,
he's had plenty of opportunity to shed 

1514
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,430
spread his genetics.
And so his,

1515
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,320
his offspring will be everywhere and 
then they'll get a chance now.

1516
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:19,283
And the thing is nobody makes it out.
Nobody makes the whole live there 

1517
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,240
either.
All by everybody.

1518
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:25,530
We're all dying.
So I mean,

1519
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,990
just so if I wouldn't have killed that 
bucket,

1520
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:29,460
it doesn't mean he's going to live 
forever.

1521
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:31,410
I mean,
he's going to die one way or another.

1522
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,960
It's not going to become a ferry.
The fact that he died,

1523
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:34,943
I shot him and he was dead within 
seconds is guaranteed and people are 

1524
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:42,870
always talk shit about this is the very 
best way he could go.

1525
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:45,430
Yeah.
You don't want them starving to death or

1526
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:46,323
you know,
dying because his teeth don't work 

1527
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,170
anymore and literally can't eat food.

1528
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:52,440
You know this,
I've seen animals where you,

1529
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:53,274
um,
you look at their teeth and they're 

1530
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,000
almost none left.
Yeah.

1531
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,750
You get a,
like a really old buck.

1532
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,670
This is buck teeth were flat in the 
back.

1533
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:01,640
So it was just when you can't eat,
they got to gum,

1534
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,110
they can't gum enough.
Yeah.

1535
01:04:03,111 --> 01:04:05,040
They can't talk a doubt.
Yeah.

1536
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,020
So it's uh,
you know,

1537
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:07,854
and,
and Adam also found two bucks that had 

1538
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,400
fought and got stuck.
They were fighting,

1539
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,710
an offense was in between them,
just a cattle fence.

1540
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:19,020
They got stuck in the fence.
Died.

1541
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,780
Yeah.
So it's just their life is,

1542
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:24,420
I mean,
how many guys out here in the street,

1543
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,060
you know,
fight and kill each other and gets stuck

1544
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:28,300
together?
It doesn't happen.

1545
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:32,010
It's life in the wild is,
I mean,

1546
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,380
unless you're out there and you witness 
things like that,

1547
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:35,860
you just live in,
it's a,

1548
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,110
it's not real.

1549
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,960
I think the real problem is perspective,
you know,

1550
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:42,480
I mean,
I think unless you're there,

1551
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:45,990
unless you are experiencing the 
wilderness itself,

1552
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,153
like a,
I've talked about my experience on 

1553
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:51,120
Prince of Wales island that um,
you know,

1554
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:53,830
Brian Cowen and Rinella and I,
uh,

1555
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,830
we were up there for sec,
I guess.

1556
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:59,340
I think we camped there for six days.
And you,

1557
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,481
your,
your,

1558
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:01,314
your idea of what like life is,
is the only based on what your 

1559
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:05,814
perception is,
like what you're seeing on a daily 

1560
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:07,674
basis.
Well,

1561
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:08,693
he,
you're seeing Ventura Boulevard and 

1562
01:05:09,831 --> 01:05:10,664
you're seeing billboards and all new 
movies coming out and keeping up with 

1563
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:14,990
the Kardashians.
Here's a new season.

1564
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:16,230
And look at that new Audi.
Wow.

1565
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:17,890
That's a sweet looking car.
Hey,

1566
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:19,390
I got the new iphone.
All right,

1567
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:21,790
and this is life.
And then you're out there and you go,

1568
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:25,150
oh well this is life to total quiet like
this.

1569
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:27,640
No.
Cell phone service.

1570
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,360
Rain animals.
Yeah.

1571
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,620
And then if you die,
no one's going to,

1572
01:05:32,621 --> 01:05:33,454
no,
no.

1573
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,560
If you fall and break your neck and die 
right there,

1574
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,750
something will eat you.
No one will find you.

1575
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,520
You're nuts.
That's normal.

1576
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:42,190
You're trying to stay warm,
you're trying to get food.

1577
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,760
And there's more spots that on this 
planet,

1578
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,970
more spots like that on this planet.
Then spots like Los Angeles.

1579
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,680
Yeah.
It's uh,

1580
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,270
it's weird.
Yeah.

1581
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:53,420
I don't know.
It's just,

1582
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,850
it's,
but that connection,

1583
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:57,010
I don't know,
I guess there's no,

1584
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,440
there's no way to see it in,
in front of your computer.

1585
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,333
No.
But I want if we can film it right and 

1586
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:06,490
share a right,
I think people will get it.

1587
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,920
Getting it a little now get it more than
what

1588
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:10,501
right now.
So,

1589
01:06:10,501 --> 01:06:12,210
I mean,
that's my goal with,

1590
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,073
you know,
what we've been talking about and I 

1591
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:16,800
mean,
we talked about the difficulty.

1592
01:06:16,801 --> 01:06:18,810
I did remember,
I wanted to mention this.

1593
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:22,350
Um,
that ha the hell was,

1594
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:26,820
I mean I've been on a lot of haunts and 
a lot of places over the years and uh,

1595
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:30,510
I hadn't struggled like ahead on this 
[inaudible] it was so difficult.

1596
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:32,670
I was telling the guys back there,
I said,

1597
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,730
I'm,
I'm questioning my life right now.

1598
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:39,210
What,
what am I doing with my life?

1599
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,540
And it was just because I'm like,
it's not going to happen.

1600
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,793
I'm not going to get it done.
And the animals don't care about my 

1601
01:06:46,561 --> 01:06:49,020
goals that they don't care about that.
Oh,

1602
01:06:49,021 --> 01:06:51,990
we're supposed to be making this great 
film and portray hunting.

1603
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,690
They're like,
now we're not,

1604
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,420
has nothing to do.
They're just staying alive.

1605
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,050
That was it.

1606
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,940
So it was just like everything that 
I've,

1607
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:02,640
I felt like I want her to do or achieve 
or my,

1608
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,590
it was just like,
it's not going to happen.

1609
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,630
And it felt like,
God,

1610
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:08,370
have I lost it?
You know?

1611
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:09,204
I mean,
I was,

1612
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:11,160
it was just like,
this is hard,

1613
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:16,680
but when it works and you do it right in
that shot happens,

1614
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,930
then it's just like,
okay.

1615
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:20,183
And I don't know,
it's just that doing something so 

1616
01:07:23,671 --> 01:07:25,200
difficult,
um,

1617
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:28,350
and being successful,
and I've said this before,

1618
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,420
has made me who I am,
you know?

1619
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,201
I mean,
without,

1620
01:07:31,201 --> 01:07:34,300
without a challenge like that,
I dunno.

1621
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,060
I Dunno where I'd be right now.
So it's,

1622
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:37,630
uh,
I dunno.

1623
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:41,760
Sometimes you cuss it and then,
man,

1624
01:07:41,761 --> 01:07:43,800
you were just so appreciative of the 
journey.

1625
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,350
Yeah.

1626
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,183
Well those difficult moments,
the only thing that makes success 

1627
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:50,830
worthwhile if success was easy,
if you woke up in the morning,

1628
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:53,170
first day yawn,
have a cup of coffee,

1629
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:54,004
step five steps,
there's the biggest deer that's ever 

1630
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:57,460
lived,
shoot one right through his heart.

1631
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,380
You wouldn't even feel it.
It wouldn't,

1632
01:07:59,381 --> 01:08:01,270
it wouldn't be like,
oh no.

1633
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,910
And I don't think people understand how 
difficult it is to,

1634
01:08:03,911 --> 01:08:06,520
because they watch these TV shows.
Have you ever watched a hunting show?

1635
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:07,354
There were half an hour long.
So you're watching 22 minutes without 

1636
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:09,761
commercials,
right?

1637
01:08:09,761 --> 01:08:11,170
Yeah,
and 22 minutes,

1638
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:13,060
you know,
they usually build up for the first,

1639
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,710
you know,
15 minutes when you know,

1640
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:16,070
we came close to them but we

1641
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,450
could not get a shot and then finally 
they get a shot,

1642
01:08:18,451 --> 01:08:23,451
which you don't see is that these,
it takes days and days and days of 10 12

1643
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:28,190
hours hike up and down mountains up and 
down and up and down.

1644
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:31,760
And when I met you,
the reason why I got in contact with you

1645
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:32,594
and the reason why I met you was because
I was so confused as to why someone 

1646
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:38,990
would need to run ultra marathons or to 
get ready for hunting.

1647
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,270
I was like,
what the fuck is this guy doing?

1648
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:44,200
Like why is he lifting weights and doing
all this shit for it?

1649
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:45,940
I didn't get it.
I was like this.

1650
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:49,730
I was just getting into it and I was 
trying to figure out like I was,

1651
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,640
I would start to watch things on 
television though,

1652
01:08:52,641 --> 01:08:55,790
starting to read certain articles and 
read certain books.

1653
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:56,871
And I was like,
well,

1654
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:59,960
what is this whole fitness connection to
hunting?

1655
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,880
Like why do they need to be in shape?
I'm like,

1656
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:03,650
I'm in pretty good shape.
Like what's the big deal?

1657
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,630
Well,
I went with Rinella and when I went with

1658
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:06,920
Grinnell,
one of the things I realized is like,

1659
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:07,754
boy,
I got pretty winded going up these 

1660
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,710
fucking hills,
like hiking,

1661
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:10,641
hiking,
tires,

1662
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:12,320
you out,
especially high altitude.

1663
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,020
And then I see your,
your videos online.

1664
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:16,880
And I was like,
what the fuck is this guy into?

1665
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,650
And then,
um,

1666
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:21,130
as I go deeper and deeper into it,
I realized like,

1667
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,770
oh,
this is like an extreme pursuit.

1668
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,680
This is not just like something,
you just go out and do this.

1669
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:31,120
It's something that's really hard to do.
And a lot of people there,

1670
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:31,731
I've,
I've,

1671
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:34,790
I've read this one article,
but there's one guy who was unsuccessful

1672
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:38,000
12 years in a row,
elk hunting before he finally,

1673
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:42,290
I shot an elk like 12 years.
Like how many times did this guy go out?

1674
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,940
How many days did he camp and the 
forest,

1675
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:49,240
how many days did he try to stock and 
get winded or snap on a twig at the last

1676
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,020
minute or,
you know,

1677
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,430
the,
the elk sees him and bolt it.

1678
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,670
Most people are unsuccessful.
Yeah.

1679
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,350
I mean,
nine out of 10 every year on successful.

1680
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:00,080
I think it's more than that.
Hunting with archery,

1681
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,160
it,
it's about,

1682
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:03,020
it's about 10% is it 10% yeah.

1683
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:08,000
So nine out of 10 are unsuccessful.
So people who don't hunt,

1684
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,380
who see,
you know,

1685
01:10:09,381 --> 01:10:10,850
dead stuff all the time,
they think,

1686
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,170
oh,
you just go out and kill an animal.

1687
01:10:12,171 --> 01:10:13,070
Right?
No.

1688
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,800
Right.
Most 90% don't.

1689
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:16,783
It is really hard.
And it's just like until you're out 

1690
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:21,734
there,
you got the bow in your hand and you're 

1691
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:23,984
trying to close in on that animal and 
you're trying to do everything right 

1692
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:26,744
from a to z with.
And there's so many variables during 

1693
01:10:30,231 --> 01:10:34,730
that whole path as like it,
it seems a possible sometimes,

1694
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,190
you know,
even even for me after 30 years,

1695
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,353
and this is a very strange connection 
that you get with nature and forget 

1696
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:44,180
about even the fact that you're pursuing
these animals to hunt them and eat them.

1697
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:45,343
But there's a very strange connection 
that you get when you're out there in 

1698
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:48,914
that total quiet woods where they live,
you're in their world and you lock eyes 

1699
01:10:53,631 --> 01:10:54,464
with them and you meet them and you see 
them and you're in this place with no 

1700
01:10:56,481 --> 01:11:00,470
cell phone reception with no people 
anywhere near you for miles and miles.

1701
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,570
Yeah.
It's a totally different feeling.

1702
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:05,260
Life shows you,
uh,

1703
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,000
another aspect of itself that you didn't
know existed.

1704
01:11:08,001 --> 01:11:08,750
Yeah,
yeah,

1705
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,700
yeah.
And it's out there every day.

1706
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:11,990
Yeah.
But we're just,

1707
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,430
you know,
and living in our,

1708
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,620
we're muted were very nice.

1709
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:17,483
You did.
There's something about cities and this 

1710
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:20,430
existence.
I mean,

1711
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:22,050
don't get me wrong,
I like it.

1712
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,333
I like a lot of it.
I liked the fact that you can go to a 

1713
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:26,190
restaurant.
I like going to the movies.

1714
01:11:26,191 --> 01:11:27,470
I like the fact that if,
uh,

1715
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,190
you know,
if your phone breaks,

1716
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:31,140
you go to the fucking mom,
get a new cell phone,

1717
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,000
all that stuff's wonderful.
It's not,

1718
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,020
not bad,
but the other stuff is fantastic too and

1719
01:11:37,021 --> 01:11:37,854
we're disconnected.
A giant percentage of our population 

1720
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:41,364
lives in these urban environments that 
have a complete and total disconnect 

1721
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:45,954
from the actual life on earth.
Like life on earth is not just urban 

1722
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:55,440
environments.
Life on earth has this broad spectrum of

1723
01:11:55,530 --> 01:12:00,530
different ways it manifests itself and 
to experience all these different ones.

1724
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:04,980
To be in Alberta and see black bears in 
the wild to be,

1725
01:12:04,981 --> 01:12:05,814
you know,
in Colorado and see mule deer and being 

1726
01:12:08,461 --> 01:12:11,130
in the woods and the mountains and to be
around these different animals,

1727
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,473
it's a different,
it's a different understanding of the 

1728
01:12:15,091 --> 01:12:18,900
actual existence that living things have
here on earth.

1729
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:19,734
That living things that share the air 
you breathe and the water you drink and 

1730
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:24,180
the earth itself.

1731
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,330
How was it that was the best part of 
that trip?

1732
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:29,280
Cause we would split up,
uh,

1733
01:12:29,281 --> 01:12:31,830
Adam would go one way.
I would go another way in the morning.

1734
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,950
I'd have mark womack with me.
He'd have a,

1735
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,920
jamison was his camera man's name would 
go with him.

1736
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:41,040
And the best part was at the end of the 
day,

1737
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,270
hearing what everybody saw and not,
not,

1738
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:46,340
not what if you killed something.
Cause we didn't care.

1739
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,550
I mean,
were there a long time,

1740
01:12:47,551 --> 01:12:50,580
it didn't kill very much,
but just what everybody saw,

1741
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:52,830
you know,
from the bucks being locked up that were

1742
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:53,940
dead.
Two,

1743
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:54,774
uh,
one morning we were up and a w heard 

1744
01:12:59,311 --> 01:13:00,144
something,
a commotion up ahead of us and mark's 

1745
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:03,200
mark says,
oh,

1746
01:13:03,201 --> 01:13:05,840
it's a bug rubbing his antlers.
And I listen for a second.

1747
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:06,211
I said,
no,

1748
01:13:06,211 --> 01:13:07,044
that's two bucks fighting.
So we took off up the hill and I got 25 

1749
01:13:09,721 --> 01:13:11,640
yards away and these bucks,
we're just going at it,

1750
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:13,200
just fighting,
pushing each other around.

1751
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:16,290
And I,
I couldn't get a clear shot,

1752
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,150
didn't get out there and time to do 
that.

1753
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:21,000
But that story.
And then Adam would say,

1754
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:22,710
well he called in three Fox,
you know,

1755
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:23,544
he did a varmint call on three Fox came 
running in or he saw this many wild 

1756
01:13:28,111 --> 01:13:28,944
boars or he was close to getting inside 
a giant fallow Bach and however it 

1757
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:35,334
didn't work out.
And then I would share a story about 

1758
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:38,250
what I saw,
you know,

1759
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:41,220
about another brown snake or something 
like that.

1760
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:42,263
And that was,
that was so fun just getting together 

1761
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,820
over the campfire.
Not talking about what we killed,

1762
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:50,820
but just what we saw and experienced,
you know,

1763
01:13:50,821 --> 01:13:52,380
and it's,
you know,

1764
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,243
I was flew home last night and just got 
in this morning to La and I'm looking 

1765
01:13:56,251 --> 01:13:58,860
around in the airport.
I was thinking about all the people,

1766
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:03,861
I wonder how many actually would get me,
you know,

1767
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,130
cause I feel like an outsider a little 
bit,

1768
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:12,070
especially coming back from the hunt and
I'm just looking at everybody thinking I

1769
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,170
don't get them.
They probably don't get me,

1770
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:16,180
but you'll at least understand what 
they're doing.

1771
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,800
I think,
you know,

1772
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:19,840
I mean,
when I was checking my luggage in it,

1773
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:24,960
I was flew virgin coming her back from 
Sydney to La and you know,

1774
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,060
the,
the lady there,

1775
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,570
the check and she's like,
oh,

1776
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,670
what's in that case?
And I said,

1777
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,330
it's about a weapon.
I go,

1778
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,070
could be,
yeah,

1779
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:37,330
yeah,
it's a bow and arrow.

1780
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:39,550
What were you doing?
I said,

1781
01:14:39,551 --> 01:14:41,320
hunting.
She's in.

1782
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:42,730
She goes,
what were you hunting?

1783
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,450
Oh,
don't tell me.

1784
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,550
Don't tell me.
She didn't want to hear it.

1785
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:48,580
Like you have leather shoes on.
I was like,

1786
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,230
I was hunting buffalo.
She's like,

1787
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,880
there's buffalo here.
I said,

1788
01:14:51,881 --> 01:14:52,840
well,
not here,

1789
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,800
but yeah,
there's,

1790
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:57,210
there's a lot of buffalo in Australia.
And uh,

1791
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:57,971
she's like,
well,

1792
01:14:57,971 --> 01:14:59,830
I don't think you can fly with a bow and
arrow.

1793
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:02,530
And I'm like,
I know you can't.

1794
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,300
Yeah you can.
I said,

1795
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:05,134
it's just like I said,
it's not even like a firearm or weapon 

1796
01:15:07,511 --> 01:15:08,380
type thing,
it's just,

1797
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,410
you just check it in just normal.
But anyway,

1798
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:12,880
I,
I was thinking,

1799
01:15:12,881 --> 01:15:13,601
I was like,
Whoa,

1800
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:14,800
man.
That's,

1801
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,260
how old was this lady?
Oh,

1802
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,270
she wasn't old.
She was much younger than me probably.

1803
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:22,660
I mean,
you can fly with a bone.

1804
01:15:22,661 --> 01:15:25,270
And what was she telling you that I 
don't know.

1805
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,950
She never looked into that.
I said,

1806
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,810
I go,
well,

1807
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:31,480
I ended up,
you didn't have to do anything.

1808
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:32,373
She said,
you're going to have to sign all this 

1809
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:35,230
stuff because they're not allowed.
And I'm just like,

1810
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,310
I said,
listen,

1811
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:39,580
I fly with this all over the world as a 
lady worked there.

1812
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,290
Yeah,
no,

1813
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,371
no.
Oh,

1814
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,160
that's hilarious.
So she said there are way more strict,

1815
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:47,130
which maybe they are verge.
I was most true.

1816
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:48,160
That's where she said,
she goes.

1817
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:48,731
I said,
well,

1818
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:51,670
I've just flew quantis to Darwin and 
back,

1819
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,160
and nobody said a word.
I said it,

1820
01:15:54,161 --> 01:15:55,120
I've,
she goes,

1821
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:57,160
have you ever been in Australia before 
with it?

1822
01:15:57,161 --> 01:15:57,994
I said,
yeah.

1823
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,130
I said,
I've listened.

1824
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,150
I've been everywhere.
It's never an issue.

1825
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,280
Trust me.
I'm not trying to blow.

1826
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:04,540
I mean,
just trust me.

1827
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,950
So anyway,
but yeah,

1828
01:16:06,951 --> 01:16:07,900
it's just,
it's just,

1829
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:10,210
there's times that I'm just like,
God,

1830
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,880
am I the outsider or,
or what?

1831
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:13,990
I don't know.
Well,

1832
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:14,824
you know,
it's like

1833
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:18,770
we were talking before this when we were
on the way over here about a show.

1834
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:20,990
They wanted me to come on and talk about
guns,

1835
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:22,093
but there's going to be like a large 
audience and is going to be a bunch of 

1836
01:16:24,861 --> 01:16:25,694
people on the panel and you talk for 
seven minutes and you go to commercial 

1837
01:16:27,741 --> 01:16:29,600
break and I'm like,
I'm not interested.

1838
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:30,733
I'm not interested in doing that because
I think that it's a long conversation 

1839
01:16:33,531 --> 01:16:34,364
that you have to have with someone and 
it takes a while for you to understand 

1840
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:37,874
their point of view.
It takes a while for them to understand 

1841
01:16:39,681 --> 01:16:40,514
your point of view.
It takes a while to establish the fact 

1842
01:16:43,401 --> 01:16:47,000
that you're a very reasonable person and
this is a very nuanced conversation.

1843
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:51,380
Much like when that guy in France ran 
over a bunch of people with his truck,

1844
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,450
I don't think the truck should be 
outlawed.

1845
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:54,453
And I think the real issue is human 
beings that are capable of doing 

1846
01:16:56,901 --> 01:16:58,940
horrible shit,
blind people,

1847
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:01,070
right?
Why are they capable of doing that?

1848
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,143
Let's get to the bottom of that and 
let's stop ignoring all the factors and 

1849
01:17:05,451 --> 01:17:07,640
just concentrating only on the weapon.
Right.

1850
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,700
That kind of is a long

1851
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:13,880
conversation that I think it takes hours
and hours and you still might not get to

1852
01:17:13,881 --> 01:17:17,120
the bottom of it.
That's how I feel about like you talking

1853
01:17:17,121 --> 01:17:19,360
to someone about hunting,
like if you came over here,

1854
01:17:19,361 --> 01:17:20,750
it's almost like,
I don't even want to tell them.

1855
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:22,610
Like if someone says like the,
you have a boat,

1856
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:24,290
like what's in the case?
I got to bow and Arrow.

1857
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:26,060
What do you do?
I practice our tree.

1858
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:27,590
Yeah.
It's easier that way.

1859
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,630
I like to shoot at targets.
Oh,

1860
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:30,950
you target shooting.
Oh,

1861
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:32,240
that's cool.
That's in the Olympics.

1862
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:33,350
Yup.
I see New Olympics.

1863
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:35,810
Yeah,
it's up my targets,

1864
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:38,610
they move and they have antlers.
I nick.

1865
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:40,310
Well,
they can't tell him that.

1866
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,760
I think I'm just like,
it takes too long.

1867
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:44,900
Yeah,
it does,

1868
01:17:44,901 --> 01:17:48,240
but I don't know.
I think I'm,

1869
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:50,510
I just don't like hiding who I am,
basically.

1870
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,190
So I'm always,
I just say,

1871
01:17:52,191 --> 01:17:53,080
Hey,
this is what I do.

1872
01:17:53,081 --> 01:17:54,200
So yeah.
She's like,

1873
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:54,951
don't tell me.
I'm like,

1874
01:17:54,951 --> 01:17:56,540
I was hunting buffalo.
I'm telling you,

1875
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:57,374
I don't care.

1876
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:01,130
They're an invasive species.
They live there.

1877
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,410
You're going to hear,
you're gonna hear what I was doing,

1878
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,540
whether you like it or not.
Nobody wants to hear.

1879
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,450
Well it's Kinda Kinda like with my,
with my social media,

1880
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:12,800
I like putting up stuff that so I can do
weed the people out,

1881
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:13,910
you know,
like holding,

1882
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,580
holding the buffalo head in the water.
I'm like,

1883
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:18,740
okay,
this is going to weed out so that people

1884
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:19,574
who I really don't want here anyway,
they're going to get mad at you for 

1885
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:23,750
sure.
But they would get mad anyway.

1886
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:25,203
And there's a lot of people that listen 
to these conversations and they get a 

1887
01:18:29,991 --> 01:18:31,700
perspective that they would have never 
had.

1888
01:18:31,701 --> 01:18:33,500
Like there's a lot of people right now 
that are listening,

1889
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:34,970
that are in their car,
that are on there,

1890
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:36,860
you know,
on the boss or whatever,

1891
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,113
and they've got the headphones on and 
they're thinking about this in a way 

1892
01:18:41,601 --> 01:18:44,290
that they never thought about it before 
because in their mind they've,

1893
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,373
because of the fact they live in these 
urban environments and they've never 

1894
01:18:47,121 --> 01:18:47,954
been exposed to hunting and they get all
their meat from a store or from a 

1895
01:18:50,151 --> 01:18:54,830
supermarket or from a restaurant,
they just never heard anybody talk about

1896
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:55,520
it.

1897
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,130
And this is a,
it's a weird part of our life.

1898
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,590
It's a d,
it's a dangerous disconnect I think with

1899
01:19:00,591 --> 01:19:01,424
life and death,
the dangerous disconnect of restaurants 

1900
01:19:03,711 --> 01:19:05,300
and supermarkets.
Well here's,

1901
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:08,780
here's one thing,
I think people just get tuned in to what

1902
01:19:08,781 --> 01:19:10,100
they're interested in.
And that's it.

1903
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:11,930
I mean,
even instagram does it.

1904
01:19:11,931 --> 01:19:14,780
So on the explore page or whatever that 
is,

1905
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:15,614
what comes up is what you look at.
So it comes up on my page is like a 

1906
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,290
hunting and fitness and that's,
so it's all that.

1907
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:29,560
So whatever you're looking at,
whether it's gay guys are or cooking,

1908
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:31,940
that's what's going.
That's what,

1909
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:32,823
that's your world.
So that's sort of what our world is now 

1910
01:19:35,331 --> 01:19:36,164
as we only,
we're only exposed to really what we 

1911
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:41,280
want to be exposed to,
you know?

1912
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,820
And that's why I'm like,
no,

1913
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,240
I'm hunting buffalo,
uh,

1914
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,680
that lady be exposed to something 
different.

1915
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,640
Right,
right,

1916
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:50,474
right.
So,

1917
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:51,740
I dunno,
it's just,

1918
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,290
um,
it's comparable.

1919
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:55,700
Comparably know what my point is,
but it's,

1920
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:57,890
what you're saying makes a whole lot of 
sense is that people,

1921
01:19:57,891 --> 01:19:58,724
do they find these communities with 
likeminded people and becomes an echo 

1922
01:20:01,461 --> 01:20:02,294
chamber.
Yeah,

1923
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:03,980
yeah.
If you're preaching to the choir,

1924
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:07,590
and that goes all the way back to like a
million hours ago,

1925
01:20:07,591 --> 01:20:08,424
it feels like since we've been talking 
about why that Netflix thing is so 

1926
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:12,024
appealing to me and having you involved,
it's just because we've reached so many 

1927
01:20:16,081 --> 01:20:20,550
new people and hunting is so,
is so important to me.

1928
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:22,200
And I think,
I mean,

1929
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,483
just the,
just so people can understand what 

1930
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:29,070
motivates us and why it's important.
I just want that,

1931
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,110
just want that shown.
Right.

1932
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:31,921
You know,
it's shared.

1933
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:33,990
Right.
But there's definitely a way to do it.

1934
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:36,030
And I,
I know where we should go.

1935
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:36,863
I mean,
whether it's the buffalo place or 

1936
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,770
somewhere else,
but I think it's a great idea to do.

1937
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,560
No,
Steven Nellis show net is on Netflix.

1938
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:44,220
Yeah.
Yep.

1939
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:48,300
And it has one star.
Does people are so angry,

1940
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:51,450
either they find it and if you shouldn't
have to eat me.

1941
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,940
Yeah.
Anything you want from salary,

1942
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:56,480
people get,
uh,

1943
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,140
they get super,
super aggro.

1944
01:20:58,141 --> 01:21:00,150
You know,
you want to make people really angry.

1945
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,520
Tell them,
tell them that there's a growing body of

1946
01:21:02,521 --> 01:21:04,410
science that shows it.
Plants are intelligent.

1947
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:05,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

1948
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:05,943
Glance thing.
They feel that the screen and all that 

1949
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,593
fucking freak out like babies or you 
don't even have to say that this 

1950
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:16,470
justifies eating meat.
Just put that.

1951
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,850
No,
when I put that on twitter,

1952
01:21:17,851 --> 01:21:18,481
just the,
the,

1953
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:19,314
the,
the data about that and people will 

1954
01:21:21,451 --> 01:21:23,670
fucking go crazy and attack me for 
hunting.

1955
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:24,653
Yeah.
Or if you talk about all the animals 

1956
01:21:26,431 --> 01:21:29,370
that die when they're one of their 
salads been made,

1957
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,490
you know,
I mean,

1958
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,000
so it's different.

1959
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,150
Whatever I,
they,

1960
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,073
they put,
they prioritize or put different 

1961
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,560
importance on,
you know,

1962
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:43,770
that we've talked about that too,
that they feel like they're doing a good

1963
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:44,990
thing.
And they also,

1964
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:46,140
in many ways,
look,

1965
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:48,700
if you're,
if you're shooing factory farm,

1966
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:51,810
you're avoiding factory farming and 
eating more salads in evening,

1967
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:52,770
uh,
you know,

1968
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:56,550
uh,
farm to table vegetables instead,

1969
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:59,610
you are definitely contributing to less 
death and suffering.

1970
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:00,600
100%.
Yeah,

1971
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:03,880
but you can tip it into some,
they just are,

1972
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:05,070
if you will,
grain.

1973
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:08,070
If you eat grain,
you're contributing to a w for,

1974
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,840
first of all,
what do you care about?

1975
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:11,820
Do you care about insects?
Like where do you draw the line?

1976
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,700
Because if you don't care about insects,
well then you're okay.

1977
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,100
But if you do,
if you think that insects are life well,

1978
01:22:17,101 --> 01:22:18,630
there's pesticides,
they're fucking,

1979
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:19,723
they're there.
It's a holocaust everyday out there 

1980
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,673
fucking bugs.
They're spraying those goddamn things 

1981
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:25,470
constantly.
I mean if you,

1982
01:22:25,471 --> 01:22:26,304
if you want to have a healthy crops,
there's a reason why they have these 

1983
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:32,890
pesticides cause they want to kill these
animals that are trying to eat the crops

1984
01:22:32,891 --> 01:22:35,970
to kill these little bugs.
And I don't know,

1985
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:36,804
I just keep going back to this recent 
trip just because I think about it and 

1986
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:40,950
it's just like,
here's another example.

1987
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:41,784
So those are the Brown snakes up there 
are second most deadly and we saw a 

1988
01:22:45,631 --> 01:22:48,720
number of brown snakes in the road while
we were driving.

1989
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,970
Adam swerves around them,
you know,

1990
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,630
try to not kill him,
not kill him.

1991
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:57,990
He wants him to stay alive while yeah,
big spider.

1992
01:22:57,991 --> 01:23:00,240
He had crawling on his face.
I saw that thing.

1993
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:01,680
Why did you let that thing grow on his 
face?

1994
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:03,220
I Dunno,
cause he's Australian.

1995
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,310
Just different.
Free to but not killing

1996
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:07,090
it.
What's happened?

1997
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:08,980
Is that on his instagram,
uh,

1998
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:09,671
it was,
yeah,

1999
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:10,900
it is somewhere.
So you got it.

2000
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:11,681
Adam.
Dot.

2001
01:23:11,681 --> 01:23:12,670
Green Tree.
Dot.

2002
01:23:12,671 --> 01:23:13,504
Bow Hunting.
Now he changed it to just Adam Green 

2003
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:16,320
tree.
Adam.

2004
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,163
Dot.
Green Tree.

2005
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:18,700
Why?
Oh,

2006
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:20,050
I don't know.
The bow hunting park.

2007
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:23,320
I think it was tutoring cruisy yeah,
maybe.

2008
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,790
Um,
I don't think he's worried about that at

2009
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,870
all.
I Dunno.

2010
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:26,641
People,
boy,

2011
01:23:26,641 --> 01:23:28,750
that guy seemed immune to,
to hate.

2012
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:29,980
Yeah.
It's,

2013
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:31,650
uh,
um,

2014
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,180
he's a great guy.
He's a,

2015
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,190
but he,
he is sensitive to,

2016
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,810
I mean he's,
it's not,

2017
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:38,673
that's what I'm saying.
It's not like we're just cold blooded 

2018
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:42,244
killers.
Right.

2019
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,770
You know what I mean?
There was one time we did,

2020
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:48,610
we didn't have an argument,
but I didn't believe him about something

2021
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:52,000
and he was so upset.
He's like,

2022
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:53,260
I,
he goes,

2023
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:54,640
I'm brutally honest,
you know,

2024
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:56,740
and he's like mad that I didn't believe 
him.

2025
01:23:57,010 --> 01:24:02,010
So it's like he's a warmhearted person.
He's not just a,

2026
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:03,663
uh,
not running over snakes and kill a 

2027
01:24:05,011 --> 01:24:06,010
robot.
No,

2028
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:06,371
no,
no.

2029
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:08,140
And so people think that we're just 
these,

2030
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,830
these cold blooded killers out there,
barbaric or whatever.

2031
01:24:11,831 --> 01:24:12,910
No,
no.

2032
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:13,893
I feel like,
and I don't want to judge people who 

2033
01:24:15,701 --> 01:24:17,410
aren't,
but I feel like we are just,

2034
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:21,460
we understand the circle of life better.
Yeah.

2035
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,353
I Dunno.

2036
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:23,243
Well,
you definitely more accustomed to being 

2037
01:24:25,021 --> 01:24:27,880
around it.
You're definitely exposed to more.

2038
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,670
Yeah.
You know,

2039
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,320
I think,
like I said,

2040
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,483
I have friends that are vegans.
I know a lot of vegans and people think 

2041
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:38,280
that for some reason I hate vegans.
I mock a lot of things.

2042
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:39,323
I make fun of things that are,
that are targets and a lot of like the 

2043
01:24:42,481 --> 01:24:47,430
proselytizing nature of vegans in the 
angry self,

2044
01:24:47,431 --> 01:24:50,190
righteous moral,
high ground stance that they take.

2045
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,410
It's easy to mock.
It's right there.

2046
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,270
It's easy.
And I think,

2047
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:58,650
I think most of the people that do it,
they do it for good reasons.

2048
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,491
Most of the,
the,

2049
01:24:59,491 --> 01:24:59,971
the,
the,

2050
01:24:59,971 --> 01:25:00,804
you know,
trying the lifestyle and eating that 

2051
01:25:02,671 --> 01:25:03,504
way,
but there's also health problems with 

2052
01:25:05,161 --> 01:25:05,994
it.
You know,

2053
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:07,620
people don't like you saying that 
either.

2054
01:25:07,621 --> 01:25:10,770
I know a lot of people that have tried 
it and they give up after awhile because

2055
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:13,440
it bought up my friend Sophie from the 
comedy store.

2056
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:15,530
She just started eating eggs again.
Yeah.

2057
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,860
For the longest time she was just trying
to just go straight Vegan.

2058
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:22,050
She kept getting her blood work back and
it wasn't healthy.

2059
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:23,200
Or,
um,

2060
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,990
actually she wasn't,
she wasn't a work.

2061
01:25:24,991 --> 01:25:28,140
Sam Harris was the blood car.
He went Vegan for a while,

2062
01:25:28,141 --> 01:25:28,974
but his blood work was all fucked up,
so he started eating fish and eggs and 

2063
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,093
yeah,
it's like there's people that buy 

2064
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:39,110
different bodies are more adaptable to 
different kinds of diets and some people

2065
01:25:39,781 --> 01:25:40,614
just don't do well and are all plant 
based diet and maybe they're not as 

2066
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:45,150
disciplined as some folks.
Maybe they're not doing it right.

2067
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,013
Yeah.
I don't know.

2068
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:48,030
It's hard to say,
but everybody,

2069
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:52,080
everybody's different.
But I don't think there's anything wrong

2070
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:55,830
with going out and killing animals and 
eating them.

2071
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:56,903
And I think that's where we differ from 
a lot of people that think that you 

2072
01:26:01,111 --> 01:26:01,944
should not be allowed to do that.
You not be allowed because it's 

2073
01:26:04,221 --> 01:26:06,350
barbaric.
I don't think it's barbaric.

2074
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:09,830
I think it's spiritual and that's what 
what freaks people out.

2075
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:12,320
They get very angry if you say that.
Yeah.

2076
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,180
But they,
but they wouldn't get angry if he talked

2077
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:15,410
about native Americans doing it.
Yeah,

2078
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,253
it's very interesting.
And the thing is is like the big 

2079
01:26:18,241 --> 01:26:20,910
difference is I don't care if they don't
eat meat.

2080
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:25,710
I don't judge them for not eating meat,
but they judge us for killing.

2081
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,210
You know what I mean?
So it's,

2082
01:26:27,211 --> 01:26:28,044
it's pretty one sided as far as they 
won't accept being a hunter and being 

2083
01:26:32,131 --> 01:26:32,964
self sufficient while any hunter I know 
isn't going on Vegan pages and talking 

2084
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:40,290
shit.
You know what I mean?

2085
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:41,363
I mean,
so it's just weird how they're so 

2086
01:26:43,201 --> 01:26:46,670
hateful and so one sided,
you know,

2087
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:50,100
up on our soapbox and I don't feel like 
we would do that.

2088
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,600
I mean,
I know we'll do it.

2089
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:54,480
I know there's going to be people that 
say they're going to say,

2090
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:55,441
oh,
first of all,

2091
01:26:55,441 --> 01:26:56,274
they can say,
how many times am I going to be on here 

2092
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,670
as many times as he can come.
Let's talk about podcast folks.

2093
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:06,930
What's the record of the most people on 
here for the most number of,

2094
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,460
I dunno,
repeat guests,

2095
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:12,100
somebody probably knows.
Probably Joey Diaz.

2096
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,610
Callan's probably pushed challen.
Yeah,

2097
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,640
account.
All the,

2098
01:27:14,641 --> 01:27:16,500
all the fight companions and everything 
and he brought,

2099
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,790
well,
oh that's true.

2100
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:19,020
Yeah.
And then they'll say,

2101
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,990
talking about more boring hunting shit.

2102
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:25,660
That's fine.
I know you don't have to listen folks.

2103
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:26,793
I do a lot of podcasts.
I've got one later today with Jordan 

2104
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:29,613
Peterson.
I guarantee you we're not going to be 

2105
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:30,990
talking about hunting.
Well it's,

2106
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:31,913
who's that?
He's a professor at the University of 

2107
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:34,690
Toronto.
He might hut.

2108
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,220
He might,
I don't think it does though.

2109
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,290
Uh,
he hunts liberals,

2110
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:40,990
but he,
one of the things is about,

2111
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:43,390
um,
what we're talking about earlier that we

2112
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:44,224
were saying that people sort of find 
their area and it becomes like an echo 

2113
01:27:47,771 --> 01:27:48,604
chamber.
And I think that's one of the issues 

2114
01:27:49,901 --> 01:27:52,690
with,
whether it's veganism or even hunting,

2115
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:53,883
is that I think that people,
they need to be had to have these 

2116
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:57,604
dialogues with people that don't 
necessarily agree with that so they can 

2117
01:28:00,761 --> 01:28:03,940
find out how the other person thinks.
And you know,

2118
01:28:03,941 --> 01:28:04,774
if you do,
if you are talking to a person who is a 

2119
01:28:06,101 --> 01:28:09,190
hunter and you find out that they're 
actually just a cruel psychopath,

2120
01:28:09,191 --> 01:28:10,120
like,
fuck man,

2121
01:28:10,121 --> 01:28:11,320
I wouldn't want to hang out with that 
guy.

2122
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,200
I mean,
I've,

2123
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,740
I haven't experienced that,
but I know they must be out there.

2124
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:19,420
So if you were sitting across him having
a freaks and everything and everything.

2125
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:20,493
Yeah.
And you were having a conversation with 

2126
01:28:21,641 --> 01:28:24,550
someone like that.
I mean it would be,

2127
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:29,200
it would be disturbing,
but I think that most people that,

2128
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,040
uh,
are,

2129
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:34,000
especially people like yourself or a guy
like remy warren or Steve Rinella,

2130
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,013
very well spoken,
who was also an advocate for 

2131
01:28:36,941 --> 01:28:38,710
conservation,
loves wildlife.

2132
01:28:38,711 --> 01:28:39,544
If they sat down and had a long form 
conversation like this with someone 

2133
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:47,170
who's a reasonable person who was a 
Vegan for all the right reasons,

2134
01:28:47,171 --> 01:28:49,500
there's a vegan because they care about 
life and cause they,

2135
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:50,403
they want to be cruelty free and they 
want to live life with his little 

2136
01:28:53,201 --> 01:28:54,034
footprint as possible.
I think they'd be surprised at how much 

2137
01:28:56,771 --> 01:28:57,760
common ground they find.

2138
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:58,870
Yeah.
I mean if you,

2139
01:28:58,871 --> 01:29:02,310
if,
if anybody spent a day in the woods with

2140
01:29:02,311 --> 01:29:03,144
remy or Adam,
they'd be shocked at how much not 

2141
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:07,104
hunting.
They know just how much they know about 

2142
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,090
the environment,
about,

2143
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:15,690
about where they're hunting about 
different species,

2144
01:29:15,691 --> 01:29:19,140
about the animals and tendencies and in 
foliage.

2145
01:29:19,141 --> 01:29:22,050
And I mean those guys are amazing.

2146
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:23,923
Almost like we were talking about like 
with the aborigines were kind of losing 

2147
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:27,494
their culture.
We're losing out on an understanding of 

2148
01:29:29,811 --> 01:29:30,644
how these people live.
There's a little bit of that could be 

2149
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:33,980
said about the,
the,

2150
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:34,843
the culture of hunting is that if it 
goes away and if it w w there was a 

2151
01:29:39,951 --> 01:29:44,840
trend about 10 maybe 1520 years ago,
where from what I've read at least,

2152
01:29:44,841 --> 01:29:47,210
obviously I'm pretty new to it.
I've only been hunting for five years,

2153
01:29:47,211 --> 01:29:52,100
but that they were considerably worried.
They were really worried.

2154
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:53,023
There was a real thought that the next 
few generations that hunting was going 

2155
01:29:56,301 --> 01:29:57,134
to dwindle down to such a such a low 
number that the hunters would not have 

2156
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:07,070
the same sort of impact in,
in terms of politically where they could

2157
01:30:07,071 --> 01:30:10,470
affect the retaining of public lands.
Yeah.

2158
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,150
And,
which is a huge issue with,

2159
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:13,053
with,
with Americans today and you're seeing 

2160
01:30:14,211 --> 01:30:15,044
it with this trump administration where 
you're seeing the erosion of the 

2161
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:17,774
environmental protection agency and the 
erosion of the status that protected 

2162
01:30:21,471 --> 01:30:22,304
status at some national monuments have 
and perhaps public lands have people 

2163
01:30:25,401 --> 01:30:27,890
were super nervous and you had a 
conversation,

2164
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:28,933
a long conversation with Jason Chaffetz,
Chaffetz Chaffetz Chaffetz who had a 

2165
01:30:34,401 --> 01:30:38,090
very controversial bill that he had out 
that was pulled back.

2166
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,133
It was a bill to sell off public land 
that was pulled back because of the 

2167
01:30:43,011 --> 01:30:45,170
activism of hunters in the people care.

2168
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:45,901
Yeah.
It was,

2169
01:30:45,901 --> 01:30:46,734
uh,
it was what they determine what they 

2170
01:30:47,971 --> 01:30:50,040
were going to,
um,

2171
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:52,380
determine was disposable.
Yeah.

2172
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:53,720
3 million acres.
Yeah.

2173
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:55,290
Disposable as well.
That was,

2174
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,393
that was hr six 21 and then there's Hr 
six 22 also said there's two of them 

2175
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:01,650
kind of back to back.
Different,

2176
01:31:01,651 --> 01:31:05,610
six 22 just took away the law 
enforcement on public lands,

2177
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:07,103
which at,
and t and they wanted to take it from 

2178
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:11,370
the,
the federal government,

2179
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:13,440
um,
to give it to the state,

2180
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:17,610
which people think that that's just a 
way where the states can say,

2181
01:31:17,611 --> 01:31:18,630
well,
we can't afford it,

2182
01:31:18,631 --> 01:31:22,500
so we're going to have to sell this 
public land because it's a resource.

2183
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:23,373
And in the states have to,
the states have to balance our budget 

2184
01:31:26,311 --> 01:31:28,530
every year.
Federal government doesn't.

2185
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:29,813
So if the state has to balance its 
budget and it's not penciling out and 

2186
01:31:33,271 --> 01:31:36,660
they can sell x amount of acres and 
that's going to help,

2187
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:38,520
they're going to do that.
That's all there is to it.

2188
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:40,620
So,
um,

2189
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:41,543
yeah,
that is,

2190
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:44,340
there's also wildfire protection.
Oh yeah,

2191
01:31:44,341 --> 01:31:44,701
yeah,
yeah.

2192
01:31:44,701 --> 01:31:45,534
I mean,

2193
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,570
bunch of issue fighting wildfires is 
all,

2194
01:31:47,571 --> 01:31:50,090
it's a federal issue,
but if it's private land,

2195
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:52,790
if the state sells it all,
that shit's gone.

2196
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:54,590
There's no more federal protection.

2197
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:56,310
Yeah.
And you look at,

2198
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:58,210
um,
I dunno,

2199
01:31:58,230 --> 01:32:00,160
it's a,
that's a big one.

2200
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:04,750
And so sportsmen's really stepped up and
that was through social media,

2201
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:05,823
how they can,
now we have more of a voice than we've 

2202
01:32:07,301 --> 01:32:08,290
ever had.
You know,

2203
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:12,100
before it was just these politicians 
making decisions and you know,

2204
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:14,500
the US little people didn't really have 
a say.

2205
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:18,670
Now we have a say.
I mean Jason Chaffetz,

2206
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:19,504
you'd think,
well,

2207
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:23,050
why would he care?
He'd look at his instagram page.

2208
01:32:23,051 --> 01:32:24,090
He might have,
you know,

2209
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:28,540
I don't think he has 20,000 whereas we 
have pretty big numbers,

2210
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:31,060
especially you.
So if you mentioned something about it,

2211
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:34,330
he gets overwhelmed with,
Hey,

2212
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:37,390
are you looking out for us?
Are you doing the right thing by us?

2213
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:38,301
Um,
we,

2214
01:32:38,301 --> 01:32:42,220
we won't vote you in next time.
And so then it makes those guys think,

2215
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:45,460
Holy Shit.
Did you see his town hall meeting?

2216
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:46,930
Yeah.
It's crazy.

2217
01:32:46,931 --> 01:32:47,764
Yeah.
It's all sportsmen and sportswomen 

2218
01:32:48,971 --> 01:32:52,870
showed up and they all people that care 
about public lands and they went crazy.

2219
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:53,830
Yeah.
That I don't,

2220
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:56,510
that was a kind of a goal.
I was,

2221
01:32:56,590 --> 01:32:57,220
I was,
yeah,

2222
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:02,220
I was had mixed mixed feelings on that 
because the yelling and stuff doesn't,

2223
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:05,720
it least it sends a very clear message.
It did.

2224
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:08,560
It doesn't accomplish much as far as 
there,

2225
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:09,603
but yeah,
it,

2226
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:11,130
it sends a message for sure.
Yeah.

2227
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:13,840
It's a dangerous and he's not going to 
be a politician anymore.

2228
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:15,500
No,
I nuns resign and I don't know.

2229
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:16,570
I'm not sure.
I haven't,

2230
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:17,523
you know,
I see every once in a while he likes 

2231
01:33:18,461 --> 01:33:19,810
some of my stuff,
so it's like,

2232
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:21,243
um,
I hear he's going into male 

2233
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:24,430
prostitution.
That's what I heard.

2234
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:26,410
Is that true?
Jamie,

2235
01:33:26,411 --> 01:33:29,290
can you go google that?
I just made that up.

2236
01:33:29,291 --> 01:33:30,460
I know Jason,
if you're listening,

2237
01:33:30,461 --> 01:33:32,380
I'm a comedian and I'm sorry.
No,

2238
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:33,220
don't.
So he,

2239
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:36,690
he seemed like a super nice guy,
but it's,

2240
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:37,870
it's a politician.

2241
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:38,860
And I told him,
I said,

2242
01:33:38,861 --> 01:33:39,940
Lucy was,
I go,

2243
01:33:39,941 --> 01:33:40,774
listen,
you're the first politician I've ever 

2244
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:43,660
met.
And he's like,

2245
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:44,523
Oh,
you've lived a charmed life puzzled by 

2246
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:48,700
representative Shavitz decision to quit 
congress.

2247
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:50,183
Ben Is that fucking deal going in that 
town hall and have all those people 

2248
01:33:53,171 --> 01:33:54,550
screaming.
I'm probably thinking,

2249
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:55,690
what am I doing?
Well,

2250
01:33:55,691 --> 01:33:56,650
he's,
you know,

2251
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,090
like I said,
he seemed nice,

2252
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:01,120
but maybe that politicians have to be 
personable.

2253
01:34:01,121 --> 01:34:02,900
That's how they get elected.
You know,

2254
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:05,470
you ever watch house of cards now?
I had show,

2255
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,280
she'll watch it freaking the fuck out if
it's really like you should be scared.

2256
01:34:09,281 --> 01:34:11,020
We should all be scared.
So I'd like to,

2257
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,640
I'd like to learn more.
I haven't,

2258
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,800
I haven't asked him,
you know,

2259
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,710
what's going on or whatever.
But yeah,

2260
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:18,603
I mean I was,
I liked the fact that he at least took 

2261
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:23,990
time out to talk about it,
you know,

2262
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:27,040
instead of just,
and I'm not sure why he did,

2263
01:34:27,041 --> 01:34:29,110
but I appreciated the fact that he did.
Well,

2264
01:34:29,111 --> 01:34:32,830
it's,
he's an interesting guy because he saves

2265
01:34:32,831 --> 01:34:35,410
money for the people by sleeping in his 
office.

2266
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:36,663
He was a cot in his office that he 
sleeps in to save money on hotel rooms 

2267
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:41,110
for the people.
So it's like,

2268
01:34:41,111 --> 01:34:41,944
yeah,
it's not like he's a total piece of 

2269
01:34:43,331 --> 01:34:44,164
shit.
No.

2270
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,850
You know,
he didn't get that feeling.

2271
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:47,260
But,
um,

2272
01:34:47,261 --> 01:34:48,094
Rinella has a very bad opinion of him 
based on his record with defending 

2273
01:34:53,171 --> 01:34:54,004
public lands and Rinella thinks that he 
does not understand the significance of 

2274
01:34:57,711 --> 01:34:58,550
these decisions.

2275
01:34:58,770 --> 01:34:59,603
These decisions are,
they are a step in the wrong direction 

2276
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:04,154
that will snowball out of control and it
will eventually lead to privatizing 

2277
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:11,300
public lands and the loss of the access 
to them by the American people that,

2278
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,153
you know,
it was all set aside by Teddy Roosevelt 

2279
01:35:13,371 --> 01:35:16,880
and all those people that had such great
insight and foresight back in the day.

2280
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:18,223
And that's,
you know,

2281
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:20,060
that was the worry with,
he says,

2282
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:20,451
well,
no,

2283
01:35:20,451 --> 01:35:22,340
I'm just taking the law enforcement 
away,

2284
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,920
um,
from these lands and gay,

2285
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:27,110
or not taking your way but giving it to 
the state.

2286
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,580
And like I said,
with the whole budget thing,

2287
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:32,780
so people were thinking that when they 
don't have enough money,

2288
01:35:32,781 --> 01:35:35,600
not just for the law enforcement,
but for,

2289
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,370
uh,
enforcing illegal timber,

2290
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,313
timber harvest and dumping trash.
And so when all that happens that that 

2291
01:35:44,211 --> 01:35:45,920
lessens the value of the land.

2292
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,100
So when the value of the land is lesson,
then it's just like,

2293
01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:49,911
okay,
whatever.

2294
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:54,290
This is a garbage dump anyway,
so it makes it easier.

2295
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:57,500
So they thought that was just a step in 
the transition of moving,

2296
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:02,620
taking that away from public land and 
privatizing it is opinion and maybe,

2297
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,160
maybe it was,
I don't know.

2298
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:07,220
Well he seemed like Jason seem like a 
very nice guy when you were interviewing

2299
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:08,054
him.
I don't know enough about that 

2300
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:10,663
particular issue,
but when you talk to God like Brunello 

2301
01:36:12,501 --> 01:36:15,170
who is deeply invested in it and very 
well read on it,

2302
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:16,543
he uh,
is of the opinion 100% that it's an 

2303
01:36:19,071 --> 01:36:19,904
incredibly negative idea.
Hr has six 21 which has gone and six 22 

2304
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:28,730
which he thinks is equally negative and 
he thinks it's essentially like a Trojan

2305
01:36:28,731 --> 01:36:29,564
horse.
Right.

2306
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:30,980
And that's,
and I told him,

2307
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:31,940
I said,
what I said too,

2308
01:36:31,941 --> 01:36:32,810
as I said,
you know,

2309
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,660
sportsmen don't support six 22 either.

2310
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,330
The girls get mad when you call it 
sportsman probably.

2311
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,800
Is there another word outdoors?
People towards,

2312
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:44,510
people can't say sports people.
You're like,

2313
01:36:44,511 --> 01:36:46,940
what?
Lacrosse players sick of that.

2314
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,100
Are you,
cause you're a man,

2315
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:51,770
your male privilege is showing,
oh son of a bitch.

2316
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:53,690
I thought it was white privilege that 
too.

2317
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:54,920
Oh,
you got to have it all.

2318
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:57,230
American privilege.
White privilege.

2319
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,260
CIS gender privilege.
Peanut butter,

2320
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,000
jelly ratios,
peanut butter and jellies.

2321
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:06,200
Racist Take Fletcher had that on.
I didn't even know what that was about.

2322
01:37:06,201 --> 01:37:08,430
All I saw was your post and the 
headline,

2323
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:11,900
just like I didn't surprise me though.
People think the peanut butter and Jelly

2324
01:37:11,901 --> 01:37:12,734
is racist.
This is how deep it gets because white 

2325
01:37:15,111 --> 01:37:15,944
people eat peanut butter and Jelly,
whereas black people don't necessarily 

2326
01:37:19,341 --> 01:37:20,174
eat peanut butter and jelly.
So to have peanut butter and jelly as a 

2327
01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:27,161
food choice in school for our kids is 
racist because other ethnic groups don't

2328
01:37:28,731 --> 01:37:32,000
necessarily eat peanut butter and jelly.

2329
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,850
What in the fuck?
Well,

2330
01:37:34,851 --> 01:37:35,684
first of all,
who doesn't like peanut butter and 

2331
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:38,560
Jelly?
Uh,

2332
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:41,750
some communists.
I think maybe Chinese folks.

2333
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,370
Uh,
from of the stars.

2334
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,440
Yeah.
Hunters probably don't.

2335
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:46,303
Yeah,
that guy from that movie molested that 

2336
01:37:47,871 --> 01:37:49,220
girl.
Um,

2337
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:50,390
yeah.
Who North Koreans?

2338
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,260
Maybe the most evil ones.
Maybe they don't like me to burn.

2339
01:37:53,261 --> 01:37:55,010
The only,
probably I don't,

2340
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:57,000
that's ridiculous.
That's delicious food choice.

2341
01:37:57,370 --> 01:37:59,550
People are just working too hard to be 
offended.

2342
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,510
So you are exactly 100% correct right 
there.

2343
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:05,610
People are working too hard to be 
offended.

2344
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:06,331
Yeah.
Yeah.

2345
01:38:06,331 --> 01:38:07,164
There's a,
there's a lot of folks out there that 

2346
01:38:08,701 --> 01:38:11,130
just looking for something to get ticked
off at.

2347
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,020
It's uh,
it's too easy.

2348
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:14,670
It's too easy to get by,
you know?

2349
01:38:14,671 --> 01:38:19,671
And I think that's also something that 
happens when life is too fucking easy.

2350
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:20,883
Yeah.
There's not enough struggle when we're 

2351
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:22,854
talking about kids and about putting 
your kids through difficult things so 

2352
01:38:26,311 --> 01:38:27,144
that they understand accomplishing goals
and they understand how things aren't 

2353
01:38:30,181 --> 01:38:30,630
easy.

2354
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:31,463
You have to struggle through stuff.
And how it's hard today because you 

2355
01:38:35,971 --> 01:38:37,230
know,
you're doing well.

2356
01:38:37,231 --> 01:38:39,150
I'm doing well.
Our kids are fine.

2357
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:40,063
You know,
they don't have to worry about where 

2358
01:38:40,651 --> 01:38:41,910
food's coming from.
It's going to be there.

2359
01:38:41,911 --> 01:38:43,080
You open the fridge,
there's the food.

2360
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:45,570
Yeah.
So you have to figure out like,

2361
01:38:45,571 --> 01:38:46,404
okay,
how do you get this kid to understand 

2362
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:50,550
and appreciate the value of a difficult 
task?

2363
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:51,563
Overcoming that difficult task and 
feeling that good feeling that you have 

2364
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:57,180
of building character and of and 
knowing,

2365
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,014
yeah,
I can push through something like you 

2366
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:02,160
had to do during that tough hunt,
very difficult.

2367
01:39:02,161 --> 01:39:04,500
Questioning yourself.
Then finally success.

2368
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:06,850
Ah,
and then you have that good feeling,

2369
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:11,220
good feeling of success and of 
accomplishment and of realizing that you

2370
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:12,083
will fight those demons in your mind and
that you will stay the course and keep 

2371
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:16,914
hammering as it were,
get through on the other end with 

2372
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:19,824
success.

2373
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:20,713
And you've done it before and even 
though you've been doing it for fucking 

2374
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:26,100
decades,
those questions still come to your mind.

2375
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,050
That's,
and that for me personally,

2376
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:28,884
that's why work as hard as I do just 
because you get wake up calls like that 

2377
01:39:32,671 --> 01:39:33,660
and you're just like,
okay,

2378
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:35,850
I gotta be on my a game.
Well,

2379
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:38,400
it's one of the reasons why I like doing
really difficult things,

2380
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:41,340
which leads me to what you've got me 
into his running.

2381
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:42,870
Yeah.
I've been fucking running lately.

2382
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:45,600
I run all the time now.
One fucking hills.

2383
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:47,610
It's crazy.
I run hills.

2384
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:51,810
I put a backpack on with a weight played
on I fucking Walk Hills.

2385
01:39:51,811 --> 01:39:53,100
I'm like,
what am I doing?

2386
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:55,410
How often are you running?
Several days a week.

2387
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,210
Really?
Yeah.

2388
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:58,910
Depending on whether or not I'm home,
like then route that we did.

2389
01:39:58,911 --> 01:39:59,640
Yep.
Okay.

2390
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,640
I'll do that route and I also do that 
steep hill near my house.

2391
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:05,700
I do that a does a couple different 
routes that I go.

2392
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:08,160
How's it?
I mean is it easier than this year?

2393
01:40:08,161 --> 01:40:12,150
But it still sucks the fat Dick.
That's what was about to say.

2394
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,780
That's like,
that's running.

2395
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:15,480
Hey,
that could be a shirt running.

2396
01:40:15,481 --> 01:40:17,310
Sucks a fat Dick.
But I love it.

2397
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,210
It's,
it's,

2398
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:25,070
it's definitely slightly easier.
Yeah,

2399
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:28,140
but they'll,
you remember that fucking steep,

2400
01:40:28,141 --> 01:40:31,880
Steep Hill once you get to the bottom 
and then you go back up as awesome.

2401
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:35,040
It is awesome.
But it is always hard.

2402
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:38,940
It's never easy when I'm getting to the 
top of that thing,

2403
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:40,230
but I could make it all the way up to 
the top.

2404
01:40:40,231 --> 01:40:41,520
Now.
I don't have to stop it.

2405
01:40:41,521 --> 01:40:42,151
Really?
Yeah,

2406
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:42,661
I can make,
oh,

2407
01:40:42,661 --> 01:40:43,450
that's good.
Yeah.

2408
01:40:43,450 --> 01:40:45,450
That's awesome.
It's fucking brutal.

2409
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,280
Yeah.
I made sure that I could get there.

2410
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:48,590
Fuck,
it's hard.

2411
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,433
But you,
you did mention that it has helped your 

2412
01:40:51,301 --> 01:40:53,010
cardio on.
Oh Dude.

2413
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:55,930
Well that's one thing that I noticed.
Like I didn't,

2414
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:59,560
I didn't uh,
kickbox for couple of weeks because I've

2415
01:40:59,561 --> 01:41:00,394
been too busy doing other stuff and I 
wanted to keep with the running because 

2416
01:41:03,431 --> 01:41:04,900
I was getting some accomplishment.
I'm,

2417
01:41:04,901 --> 01:41:06,180
I was getting some um,
um,

2418
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,360
progress out of it.

2419
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,640
I was seeing progress and then,
uh,

2420
01:41:09,641 --> 01:41:10,690
I started,
uh,

2421
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:12,850
going back into some of my other 
workouts.

2422
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:13,803
It didn't affect my weightlifting and 
all my Catawba Kettlebell workouts at 

2423
01:41:15,971 --> 01:41:17,470
all.
But man kickboxing,

2424
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:20,770
it really affected it.
It affected it a real positive way cause

2425
01:41:20,771 --> 01:41:21,604
I'm doing all hills,
so I'm basically sprinting a lot jacked 

2426
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:28,870
spike.
And so when I was a,

2427
01:41:28,871 --> 01:41:30,610
I was doing rounds in the bag the other 
day,

2428
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:31,391
I was like,
she is,

2429
01:41:31,391 --> 01:41:33,660
I got a lot of wind.
It's kind of crazy.

2430
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:34,510
That's awesome.
Yeah,

2431
01:41:34,511 --> 01:41:35,344
it was like deep into like the third and
fourth round and I was still slamming 

2432
01:41:38,201 --> 01:41:40,360
the bag and I was like,
this is weird.

2433
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:42,400
It's like I've got like an extra gear 
here.

2434
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:44,230
Did A,
have you dropped any weight?

2435
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:45,850
Yeah,
I've dropped a few pounds.

2436
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:50,500
Probably like somewhere between one 94 
one 96 where I was,

2437
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:55,090
I was hovering around 200 but I've 
dropped down before just by my diet.

2438
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:57,760
Gut shitty again,
got shitty again.

2439
01:41:57,761 --> 01:42:01,360
When I went to Mexico I gained like 
eight pounds in a week in Mexico.

2440
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:03,940
Yeah.
Be Year and Mexican food.

2441
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,760
That's not good.
That's not good for weight control.

2442
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:09,820
Where's definitely not taste good 
though.

2443
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:11,183
Yeah.
Well I haven't been doing Jujitsu very 

2444
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:14,800
much when I do Jujitsu a lot.
I fucking,

2445
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:17,110
the weight just flies off.
Really need anything.

2446
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:18,723
I could eat a horse,
but it's a Jujitsu just so calorie 

2447
01:42:22,811 --> 01:42:24,030
intensive.
Yeah,

2448
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:24,760
I mean,
yeah,

2449
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:27,970
the way it burns.
Just fighting for your life.

2450
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:28,840
Well,
let's know,

2451
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:31,990
what's your running goal?
Um,

2452
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,940
I don't have a running goal.
I just,

2453
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,170
I'm definitely going to keep doing it 
and keep getting in better shape.

2454
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,690
And then if something,
if I decide,

2455
01:42:40,691 --> 01:42:42,970
okay,
I need something to strive for,

2456
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,220
then here's my goal.
Okay,

2457
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,113
I want to do the key.
Pam Ran Five K next year and fucking 

2458
01:42:48,761 --> 01:42:52,300
kick ass at it instead of this year when
I did it where I was like,

2459
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:54,430
oh Jesus,
this is hard.

2460
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,660
Well,
the zero running.

2461
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:56,793
How about this guy?
Almost 25 seconds short of the two hour 

2462
01:42:59,561 --> 01:43:01,840
marathon barrier.
So crazy.

2463
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:05,590
He did break the world record though.
It broke the world record.

2464
01:43:05,591 --> 01:43:09,400
Two hours and 20 seconds.
25 seconds I believe it was.

2465
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,353
So he was only 25 seconds short of 
breaking what people think is this 

2466
01:43:13,871 --> 01:43:16,270
unattainable record.
That's insane.

2467
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:18,220
He'll break it or someone like him would
break.

2468
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:19,720
Somebody will.
Yeah,

2469
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:23,380
but it's so close.
So in Nike's apparently lied to you will

2470
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,313
invest.
Yeah,

2471
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:26,680
I don't think so.
I'm not built like that guy.

2472
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,530
They're all built the same way.
Like

2473
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,020
popsicle sticks,
super humid.

2474
01:43:31,021 --> 01:43:33,420
When he was running this too,
it was like 70% humidity,

2475
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:36,680
which isn't like ideal.
No hot water.

2476
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:37,630
Oh,
that's high.

2477
01:43:37,890 --> 01:43:39,690
Well that probably could have been the 
20 seconds.

2478
01:43:39,691 --> 01:43:40,590
Right?
Oh for sure.

2479
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:41,433
Yeah.
Maybe they could do that in Seattle in 

2480
01:43:42,481 --> 01:43:44,820
the winter.
The course is running on is in Milan.

2481
01:43:44,821 --> 01:43:47,010
I guess there's an article I just read 
yesterday.

2482
01:43:47,011 --> 01:43:49,470
I think it was on tech crunch maybe or 
wired.

2483
01:43:49,471 --> 01:43:50,304
Somebody like a for there was trying to 
break a half marathon and he wanted to 

2484
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:54,494
see if he could break a 90 minute or 
half marathon and was his first time 

2485
01:43:57,261 --> 01:43:58,094
running on that course and he broke up 
like two and a half minutes so that 

2486
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:04,040
there's something special about that 
course to take a mile and a half track.

2487
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:06,530
I don't know why you'd be able to run 
faster necessarily there,

2488
01:44:06,531 --> 01:44:10,250
but punk can and those shoes they made 
two or what is it?

2489
01:44:10,251 --> 01:44:15,020
What's the deal with the shoes?
Something spus super special training.

2490
01:44:15,021 --> 01:44:16,550
I don't know exactly.
You can't buy him yet.

2491
01:44:16,551 --> 01:44:18,170
You can like only when I'm off a raffle.

2492
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:20,020
Maybe if you had under armor he would've
won.

2493
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:23,200
That's it.
Maybe keep hammering.

2494
01:44:23,201 --> 01:44:24,034
Choose good under armour.
Keep hammering shoes that you could get 

2495
01:44:26,891 --> 01:44:29,140
an underarmour.com can you get your key 
hammering shoes?

2496
01:44:29,141 --> 01:44:30,580
Can you buy them anywhere?
I don't think so.

2497
01:44:30,581 --> 01:44:34,140
What the fuck under armour get on the 
ball if you can't buy my,

2498
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:36,550
my three five your shirt I always wear 
either.

2499
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:38,530
Yeah.
Well that's a rare thing.

2500
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,350
Shirt with buttons.
She keep that away from the public.

2501
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:44,020
That's super important.
We are,

2502
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:45,790
I don't know what it's going to be 
released,

2503
01:44:45,791 --> 01:44:49,990
but the Cameron hanes line is coming out
the Cameron Hanes,

2504
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:51,490
underarmour UAA hunt.
Ron.

2505
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,260
Yeah,
yeah,

2506
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:53,093
yeah.
That's awesome.

2507
01:44:53,110 --> 01:44:55,390
And you're going to have a say in how 
it's designed.

2508
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:58,180
It's awesome.
It's the boots are amazing.

2509
01:44:58,380 --> 01:44:59,213
Yeah.
Yeah.

2510
01:44:59,230 --> 01:45:00,850
Beautiful boots.
Uh,

2511
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:04,210
Kamma shorts,
pants,

2512
01:45:06,030 --> 01:45:08,770
base layer,
hoodie jacket.

2513
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:10,210
It's killer.
And when is this?

2514
01:45:10,210 --> 01:45:11,830
All this stuff.
You don't know when it's coming out now?

2515
01:45:11,831 --> 01:45:12,664
I don't know.
But they're in the in development stage 

2516
01:45:13,961 --> 01:45:14,620
right now.
Yeah.

2517
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:18,190
I think that they texted me when I was 
in Australia and said they have samples.

2518
01:45:18,191 --> 01:45:19,024
And for me it was awesome when you took 
over the UAE hunt page on instagram and 

2519
01:45:21,581 --> 01:45:22,900
you'll do more of that now.
Right?

2520
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:24,380
Because I talked to Brian,
you know,

2521
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:25,583
Brian,
we're going to get on the ball with 

2522
01:45:26,141 --> 01:45:28,000
this.
Yeah.

2523
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:30,940
I mean when I took it over the week that
I took over there was,

2524
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:34,690
so if you look at impressions on 
Instragram it went up 3 million.

2525
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:38,860
Well that seems like a good thing Brian 
isn't I really wait,

2526
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,700
we're waiting for response looking at 
Brian off here.

2527
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:44,560
Looking at him in the camera.
You can look at him up there.

2528
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,520
Oh it's up.

2529
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:49,380
Yeah.
So no,

2530
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:53,850
and when Adam took it over,
when we're on that Australia hunt it,

2531
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:57,400
it went up like they went from,
what was it,

2532
01:45:57,460 --> 01:46:02,460
a 493,000 to 502,000 followers.
So pretty good jump.

2533
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:03,460
Yeah,
that's good jump.

2534
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:05,170
Yeah,
I posted it on instagram too.

2535
01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:06,123
Yeah.
And it's just a matter of putting out 

2536
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:09,010
interesting content.
Yeah,

2537
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:12,010
well that's what I was saying.
Like the instagram story was nice,

2538
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:14,680
but I would have really loved it if you 
guys were street.

2539
01:46:14,681 --> 01:46:17,080
If there was a way to stream like more 
often,

2540
01:46:17,081 --> 01:46:20,920
like you had like very specific moments 
where he's streaming and I think that as

2541
01:46:20,921 --> 01:46:21,754
technology advances especially,
did you see what a Ilan Musk is trying 

2542
01:46:24,791 --> 01:46:25,624
to do?
He's trying to fill the world with one 

2543
01:46:27,101 --> 01:46:27,934
gigabyte Internet and he's going to do 
is launch satellites into the year 

2544
01:46:30,941 --> 01:46:35,200
that's going to allow people to have one
gigabyte is fucking insane fast.

2545
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:39,040
And if that happens you can stream live 
from anywhere.

2546
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:39,993
But say goodbye to privacy by the way.
It's going to be drones filming people 

2547
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:47,500
right outside their window.
It's going to get really crazy but live.

2548
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:50,130
But what's going to be interesting is 
you can in a place like

2549
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,650
where you were and you could,
you know,

2550
01:46:52,651 --> 01:46:55,590
call people from your phone,
you can film things,

2551
01:46:55,591 --> 01:46:56,424
you could stream live and all that stuff
would be available and you would have 

2552
01:46:59,581 --> 01:47:02,160
real Internet access in the,
in the bush.

2553
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:04,430
And that's what people,
people like that,

2554
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:06,740
I mean they're already asking wins a 
film coming out,

2555
01:47:06,741 --> 01:47:07,161
you know,
we,

2556
01:47:07,161 --> 01:47:07,994
we filmed this,
mark womack with his company's sub 

2557
01:47:10,131 --> 01:47:10,964
seven,
filmed it for under armour and we're 

2558
01:47:12,561 --> 01:47:14,660
like,
we gotta turn this thing around fast.

2559
01:47:14,661 --> 01:47:16,840
And I saw under armour put out,
this can come out in the fall.

2560
01:47:16,841 --> 01:47:18,710
I'm like,
bullshit,

2561
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:20,760
listen,
let's get this out.

2562
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:23,720
Fucking may know people came.
People like,

2563
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:26,600
I mean the chop chop,
people don't have patience anymore.

2564
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:28,160
I don't have patience anymore.
I don't either.

2565
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:29,630
I would like you to finish the sentence 
quicker please.

2566
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:32,270
I T I saw,
uh,

2567
01:47:32,690 --> 01:47:33,523
I saw mark womack,
we got off the plane together and in La 

2568
01:47:36,171 --> 01:47:37,190
here and I'm like,
Hey,

2569
01:47:37,191 --> 01:47:39,340
you get that movie done or what?
He's,

2570
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:42,560
he's on the plane.
He said he was working,

2571
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:44,390
he had been editing.
So I'm like,

2572
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:45,860
all right,
let's get that thing posted.

2573
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:47,450
So I don't know.
I mean,

2574
01:47:47,451 --> 01:47:48,284
people are primed for right now.
They follow along and in our super 

2575
01:47:51,561 --> 01:47:54,600
invested in it and it'd be,
it'd be awesome to get it up close.

2576
01:47:54,601 --> 01:47:56,990
And I'm your manager now,
so I'm going to make some calls.

2577
01:47:57,470 --> 01:47:59,990
We've already decided we're going to 
make things happen quicker.

2578
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:01,340
Yeah,
you got me running.

2579
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:03,020
You got me doing a lot of shiny shit,
dude.

2580
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,030
You gotta be do a lot of things I didn't
think I'd be doing.

2581
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:06,080
Oh,
that's awesome.

2582
01:48:06,170 --> 01:48:06,890
So,
uh,

2583
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:08,360
I oh yeah.
Well good.

2584
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:10,220
So I want to make some cryo you to,
for,

2585
01:48:10,221 --> 01:48:12,590
uh,
for giving me this.

2586
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:13,670
Just talk about landforms.

2587
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,950
I really do think that it's made a big 
impact.

2588
01:48:16,951 --> 01:48:20,940
And I think you and Rinella and Remy 
Warren and Adam and the people that I've

2589
01:48:20,941 --> 01:48:21,774
had on it and Jim shockey and you know,
real representatives of the noble 

2590
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:28,970
pursuit,
the,

2591
01:48:28,971 --> 01:48:33,971
the real,
the real hardcore enthusiasts that truly

2592
01:48:35,161 --> 01:48:38,670
have a deep love of nature and they've 
given these people,

2593
01:48:38,671 --> 01:48:39,504
this,
this platform and giving these people 

2594
01:48:40,951 --> 01:48:43,140
this,
this way to communicate these ideas.

2595
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:46,290
I think the,
the millions and millions of people that

2596
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:48,690
have listened to you guys,
it's changed perception.

2597
01:48:48,691 --> 01:48:49,524
And I think that that perception is,
there's a ripple effect and that 

2598
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:55,410
perception is going to lead people to 
maybe read your book,

2599
01:48:55,610 --> 01:48:56,970
um,
or you know,

2600
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,650
read maybe Rinella,
his book,

2601
01:48:58,651 --> 01:49:02,580
meat eater or maybe listen to some of 
these books on tape or maybe,

2602
01:49:02,581 --> 01:49:03,414
you know,
look into Aldo leopold or looking to 

2603
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,353
some of these people that have really 
been these huge figures in conservation 

2604
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:11,544
and the love of wildlife and hunting.
And they'll get a different 

2605
01:49:13,891 --> 01:49:14,724
understanding of it than people have had
because of movies like that split movie 

2606
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:19,190
where the hunters or purse,

2607
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,490
yeah,
the trade is a child molester.

2608
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:24,730
It's like it right now,
you know that you said hunting was dying

2609
01:49:24,731 --> 01:49:25,564
or you know the one that was the fear 
and now they're like in my instagram 

2610
01:49:29,681 --> 01:49:32,170
page is 20 year old guys,
you know,

2611
01:49:32,171 --> 01:49:33,004
that are our intuit and our,
our buying bows and the bell rack back 

2612
01:49:35,951 --> 01:49:36,784
home is packed and you know,
eva shockey and I will do appearances 

2613
01:49:41,081 --> 01:49:44,710
and we have a line that goes for hours,
you know,

2614
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:46,930
young girls waiting for her,
cause she's a,

2615
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,220
you know,
and

2616
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:51,700
her book coming out,
taking aim as about that lifestyle.

2617
01:49:51,701 --> 01:49:52,534
So I mean I feel like we're sort of 
turning the corner maybe a little bit 

2618
01:49:55,841 --> 01:49:56,674
and so we just keep that momentum going.
I think for sure it's turning the 

2619
01:49:58,961 --> 01:49:59,621
corner.
I mean,

2620
01:49:59,621 --> 01:50:00,454
as far as what I see in the 
communication that I get with people 

2621
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:05,170
online,
I mean the bowl rock,

2622
01:50:05,171 --> 01:50:06,004
is it,
are they experiencing an up jumping 

2623
01:50:06,770 --> 01:50:07,750
sales?
Yeah,

2624
01:50:07,751 --> 01:50:09,610
I mean winked.
Yeah.

2625
01:50:09,611 --> 01:50:11,770
I mean,
Wayne the other day,

2626
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:13,870
like,
I can't even remember what day it was,

2627
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:17,650
but he sold something like 40 bows that 
day in a day.

2628
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:18,790
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2629
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:20,673
For folks who don't know,
that's like 50,000 plus dollars in bows 

2630
01:50:24,281 --> 01:50:26,650
in a day and bows or a specialized 
thing.

2631
01:50:26,651 --> 01:50:29,050
It's not,
it's not something that people,

2632
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:29,771
you know,
it's,

2633
01:50:29,771 --> 01:50:30,604
it's a very,
there's a steep learning curve to get 

2634
01:50:32,351 --> 01:50:33,550
involved.
You know,

2635
01:50:33,551 --> 01:50:37,360
like we were talking about it,
about if there was a hoyt academy.

2636
01:50:37,570 --> 01:50:39,280
Yeah.
In California,

2637
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:42,280
if there's a place to go,
there's not a whole lot of places to go.

2638
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:43,323
Like when you took Scott Eastwood,
you went to that place down in 

2639
01:50:45,191 --> 01:50:46,480
riverside,
riverside,

2640
01:50:46,481 --> 01:50:47,380
our streets.
Is that what it was?

2641
01:50:47,381 --> 01:50:49,720
Yeah.
There's a few great places like that,

2642
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:55,110
but there's 30 million people here and 
it might be five of those spots.

2643
01:50:55,271 --> 01:50:56,140
Yeah.
You know,

2644
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:59,240
I would love it if hoyt had a place 
where our,

2645
01:50:59,241 --> 01:51:01,440
ideally they had more than one place.
You know,

2646
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:04,390
where people could go and you would get 
fitted.

2647
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:06,880
They would find out what's your proper 
draw length.

2648
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:07,950
You know what,
how,

2649
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,210
you know,
what weight should you start at?

2650
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:14,770
What weight arrows should just start at.
Someone can teach you how,

2651
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:15,693
what the proper form is,
how to release an arrow correctly and 

2652
01:51:18,731 --> 01:51:20,380
really understand.
But just,

2653
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:21,214
I mean,
even if there's someone never wants to 

2654
01:51:21,881 --> 01:51:23,680
hunt,
just understand the,

2655
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:24,693
the meditative and beautiful effect of 
just launching an Arrow at a target and 

2656
01:51:28,091 --> 01:51:31,690
have it hit that x,
the witchery of archery,

2657
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,460
which re yeah.
Is At witchery.

2658
01:51:33,461 --> 01:51:34,840
That's a book.
Oh really?

2659
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,770
Or the witchcraft of our county or zen 
and the art of archery is a great book.

2660
01:51:39,010 --> 01:51:42,430
It's a book the witchcraft of archery.
Cause it looked that up.

2661
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:43,990
Hmm.
I'm almost positive.

2662
01:51:43,991 --> 01:51:45,730
I read it.
Really.

2663
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:49,601
Jamie,
come on.

2664
01:51:49,601 --> 01:51:51,680
Help me out.
You're leaving me hanging.

2665
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:54,730
I definitely craft of archery.
Is it?

2666
01:51:54,731 --> 01:51:56,500
No.
Uh,

2667
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,910
yes.
Nope.

2668
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:00,280
Yes.
Come on.

2669
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:05,620
It's probably a only one copy guy handed
to look at.

2670
01:52:05,621 --> 01:52:06,730
I wrote this.
Oh,

2671
01:52:06,731 --> 01:52:07,900
you don't believe him?
Wow.

2672
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:10,120
It witchcraft of archery.
Here we go.

2673
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:13,090
Which craft of our tree,
which craft posts?

2674
01:52:13,091 --> 01:52:16,600
Archery.
This is not looking good registry.

2675
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:21,010
Which Klaff page pagan,
which splits in the which I'll work.

2676
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:23,310
Hmm.
Um,

2677
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:24,793
not looking good.
The witchcraft of archers according to 

2678
01:52:28,601 --> 01:52:31,540
the famous thing like that.
All right,

2679
01:52:31,541 --> 01:52:32,470
interesting.
Okay.

2680
01:52:32,471 --> 01:52:34,570
Does,
can we edit this part out?

2681
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:37,780
Nope.
Just kidding.

2682
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:41,190
The sorcery of archery.
Yeah,

2683
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,850
it's fun.
It's a beautiful discipline.

2684
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,010
I mean even if someone never choose,
and honestly if

2685
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,650
you really want to get into hunting,
just straight up hunting,

2686
01:52:48,651 --> 01:52:50,150
he'd probably just start with a rifle 
anyway.

2687
01:52:50,151 --> 01:52:52,970
It's a far easier way to do it.
No,

2688
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:54,500
no,
don't say that.

2689
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,000
Or wear earplugs.
If you do do it,

2690
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:58,160
you don't want to blow your ears out for
sure.

2691
01:52:58,161 --> 01:52:58,994
Another problem that I'm running into is
a lot of people have been hunting for a 

2692
01:53:01,701 --> 01:53:02,534
good portion,
a portion of their life have bad 

2693
01:53:04,161 --> 01:53:04,994
hearing.
I know my ears ring all the time for 

2694
01:53:06,691 --> 01:53:08,000
when I rifle hunted.
That's crazy.

2695
01:53:08,001 --> 01:53:11,690
And it was just a kid cause I used to go
shoot my 300 winchester magnum up at the

2696
01:53:11,691 --> 01:53:14,350
rock pit bull.
I mean that's thing was so loud.

2697
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:16,520
I used to love shooting and I was like,
Oh,

2698
01:53:16,521 --> 01:53:18,080
you're a pussy if you weren't.
I mean,

2699
01:53:18,081 --> 01:53:20,690
nobody wore here re hearing protection.
Not Crazy.

2700
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,940
It's just like nobody wore bike helmets 
either.

2701
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,863
You know what I mean?
Right.

2702
01:53:23,890 --> 01:53:25,470
So it's the same type of thing.
But now my ears,

2703
01:53:25,471 --> 01:53:27,260
this ring all the time.
Yeah,

2704
01:53:27,261 --> 01:53:29,510
all the time.
It shows you tasted music.

2705
01:53:29,511 --> 01:53:31,120
That's why.
Why Toy?

2706
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:32,660
Listen to some of your instagram 
stories.

2707
01:53:32,661 --> 01:53:33,494
Listen to the music.
You're listening with Jesus Christ now 

2708
01:53:35,481 --> 01:53:38,390
than it was raining when your ears are 
ringing.

2709
01:53:38,730 --> 01:53:39,563
Sounds better.

2710
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:44,340
What?
The country or the rapper?

2711
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:47,210
Oh No,
the RAF is good.

2712
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:48,980
Me and Adam,
listen,

2713
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:51,840
we drove,
drove to Sydney for two hours.

2714
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:56,210
I think we listen to a Kendrick Lamar,
uh,

2715
01:53:56,630 --> 01:53:59,900
his new song like probably 20 times.
Wow.

2716
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,130
In a row.
Yes.

2717
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:02,990
Did you guys like seeing the words 
along?

2718
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:05,690
It looks a word window if we still don't
really even know words.

2719
01:54:05,691 --> 01:54:06,524
Did you say the sing along with the n 
word or do you guys get silent during 

2720
01:54:08,751 --> 01:54:12,100
that part?
It just kind of does.

2721
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:16,160
It's a funny thing,
man.

2722
01:54:16,161 --> 01:54:18,620
With white people.
Like what are we supposed to do it?

2723
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:21,170
What are we supposed to do when it gets 
to that part of the song?

2724
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:24,500
It's called be humble.
Be Humble.

2725
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:26,210
No,
that's a song.

2726
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,930
Oh yeah.
Humboldt and then be humbled to when the

2727
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:32,870
n word comes up,
just cause that realize it's actually be

2728
01:54:32,871 --> 01:54:33,560
humble bitch.

2729
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:34,700
Be Humble.
Oh really?

2730
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:36,140
Yeah.
It's a good one.

2731
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,300
That's a mixed message.
Do you know that one?

2732
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:40,540
Jamie?
I was going to ask you,

2733
01:54:40,610 --> 01:54:44,350
how'd they like that new album went down
in Australia with the Kendrick will?

2734
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,630
Yeah.
He know about it until you brought it up

2735
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:48,031
to him.
Well,

2736
01:54:48,031 --> 01:54:49,190
you know,
he made fun of me.

2737
01:54:49,191 --> 01:54:52,190
I always put in my instance,
my music on the instant story.

2738
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:54,160
Rap a lot.
No,

2739
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:55,410
a lot of rap though.
Yeah.

2740
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,340
And country.
That's kind of what I listen to.

2741
01:54:57,530 --> 01:54:59,750
But then he had this song,
I'm like,

2742
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:00,441
okay,
Hey,

2743
01:55:00,441 --> 01:55:02,420
where the hell do you think you learned 
a song from?

2744
01:55:02,421 --> 01:55:04,220
From me.
And what did he say?

2745
01:55:04,610 --> 01:55:05,800
I don't know.
Made something out.

2746
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:06,770
Yeah.
Who probably lied.

2747
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:10,010
Are there any Australian wrappers?
I think there are.

2748
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,260
I did not.
Not that anybody knows,

2749
01:55:12,261 --> 01:55:13,820
but I,
I remember they had,

2750
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:14,683
we had the radio on down there and they,
there was some rap on there that had no 

2751
01:55:18,141 --> 01:55:20,030
idea what it was.
So it has to be from there.

2752
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:24,500
Well there's so many different rappers 
now though.

2753
01:55:24,501 --> 01:55:26,480
There's no way you could know all that 
stuff.

2754
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:27,343
It's like we've reached a weird 
saturation point with music where there 

2755
01:55:30,831 --> 01:55:31,664
is no god.
I mean every year that coming out with 

2756
01:55:32,841 --> 01:55:34,100
new music.
Yeah,

2757
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:34,993
I know.
But I mean you get used to the certain 

2758
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:41,750
sounds or certain styles.
And this was like something I had never.

2759
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:43,100
I've,
I've listened to a lot.

2760
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:44,460
I was in Brazil.

2761
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:46,120
You were in Brazil with me.
Yeah.

2762
01:55:46,270 --> 01:55:47,850
Uh,
but one time when I was in Brussels,

2763
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:50,220
listen to some rap music,
some Brazilian rap,

2764
01:55:50,221 --> 01:55:51,660
I was like,
this is bad ass.

2765
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:52,543
Yeah.
I hope what they're saying isn't stupid 

2766
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:55,800
cause it's,
I don't understand Portuguese,

2767
01:55:55,801 --> 01:55:57,480
but it sounds bad ass.
Yeah.

2768
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:58,333
It's a great,
I think it would be great to work out 

2769
01:55:59,581 --> 01:56:00,400
too.
Yeah.

2770
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:01,950
You don't know what it's not as 
distracting,

2771
01:56:02,290 --> 01:56:03,810
right?
Like if their lyrics are corny.

2772
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:05,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

2773
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,170
I Dunno.
I Dunno,

2774
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:11,550
but I think there is Australian rap,
but it's not Kendrick Lamar.

2775
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,310
Be Humble.
Eylea oh,

2776
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:19,460
right now my dig is Elliot.
She's from,

2777
01:56:19,461 --> 01:56:22,920
she's from Australia.
She's white,

2778
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:26,340
white privilege.
Black people over there.

2779
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:27,563
They do.
Right.

2780
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:31,140
But my ex pats,
American expats sneak over there.

2781
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:33,270
Yeah,
I'm not sure.

2782
01:56:33,450 --> 01:56:34,283
Okay.
That's one of the few places I would 

2783
01:56:36,361 --> 01:56:38,510
live outside of America.
Like if the shit hit,

2784
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:39,353
that's nice there.

2785
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:41,400
Canada and Australia.
Those are my spots.

2786
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:42,263
Yeah,
it's cool.

2787
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:43,133
I mean Sydney traffic is ridiculous 
while they fucking drive on the wrong 

2788
01:56:46,681 --> 01:56:47,880
side of the road.
They're all confused.

2789
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:49,260
Yeah.
That's on the left.

2790
01:56:49,261 --> 01:56:52,470
Like what are you doing over here or 
over there?

2791
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:54,840
Go over there.
Let's switch this around everybody.

2792
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,750
That's probably why it's all messed up.
Like look,

2793
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,230
the roads are in place.
Everything.

2794
01:56:58,231 --> 01:57:00,960
They got roads in the right spot.
Traveling the inside.

2795
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:02,100
Yeah.
Simple fix.

2796
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:03,360
Yeah,
we'll fix.

2797
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,640
How's Sydney?
So traffic filled.

2798
01:57:05,641 --> 01:57:09,060
I mean how many people live in Sydney?
5 million.

2799
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:10,860
Whoa,
that's crazy.

2800
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:12,390
Yeah.
If 5 million.

2801
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:14,250
That's crazy.
No,

2802
01:57:14,251 --> 01:57:19,251
it took think of that because there's 30
million people in all of Australia or is

2803
01:57:19,681 --> 01:57:21,300
it less?
I think it's a little less,

2804
01:57:21,301 --> 01:57:22,440
probably less.
Okay.

2805
01:57:22,441 --> 01:57:25,140
Let's say it's 20 million,
so it's,

2806
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:30,230
that would be like if there was 75 
million in Los Angeles.

2807
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,440
Yeah,
no more centered and more than that.

2808
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:39,090
It'd be more be like 80 million,
80 million people just in Los Angeles.

2809
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:40,930
Yeah.
There's only like,

2810
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,120
like a few big city.
I mean Melbourne or,

2811
01:57:45,121 --> 01:57:49,300
I probably said it wrong.
23.7 million in all of Australia to five

2812
01:57:49,301 --> 01:57:51,720
or in Sydney.
Jesus Christ.

2813
01:57:51,721 --> 01:57:54,510
That's crazy.
25% of the entire population.

2814
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:56,310
It's a beautiful city though.
I love it.

2815
01:57:56,690 --> 01:57:58,620
Sydney is really awesome.
Yeah,

2816
01:57:58,860 --> 01:57:59,431
no,
it's great.

2817
01:57:59,431 --> 01:58:02,400
It's just,
we were going to go to the boat shop and

2818
01:58:02,401 --> 01:58:03,360
I said,
you know,

2819
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,890
I go to the butcher shops in Sydney,
right?

2820
01:58:04,891 --> 01:58:05,790
He's like,
yeah.

2821
01:58:05,791 --> 01:58:07,110
I said,
how long's it gonna take to get there?

2822
01:58:07,111 --> 01:58:09,240
So we did it on the map quest sang or 
whatever,

2823
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,460
an hour.
That's like I said,

2824
01:58:11,461 --> 01:58:15,000
this is like La.
This sucks hours in the same city.

2825
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:19,230
I didn't expect that.
Everything is fine.

2826
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,240
You don't have to worry about shit up 
there.

2827
01:58:21,241 --> 01:58:23,610
You've got two lane roads and there's no
cars.

2828
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:26,220
If you don't make it through one traffic
light cycle,

2829
01:58:26,221 --> 01:58:27,950
you're like,
what the hell is going on?

2830
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:30,010
Wait,
this is bull shit.

2831
01:58:30,011 --> 01:58:30,844
Yeah.
Well you get used to a place like that 

2832
01:58:32,161 --> 01:58:33,390
man.
You know,

2833
01:58:33,391 --> 01:58:34,224
and he life,
it's nice and calm and it feels 

2834
01:58:36,781 --> 01:58:37,614
different.
Like life feels different in a small 

2835
01:58:39,331 --> 01:58:40,910
town.
It's like there's a,

2836
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:41,913
I feel like,
and this is some woo woo spiritual 

2837
01:58:43,751 --> 01:58:45,310
bullshit that I have no,
uh,

2838
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,473
no science behind whatsoever.
But I feel like people give off energy 

2839
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:50,763
and I feel like cities,
whether or not something's happening or 

2840
01:58:52,871 --> 01:58:54,880
not,
the amount of humans in there,

2841
01:58:54,881 --> 01:58:55,714
there's a certain amount of energy that 
you feel and when you're in a smaller 

2842
01:58:58,001 --> 01:58:59,650
town,
you're calmer.

2843
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:01,260
Yeah.
I really believe that.

2844
01:59:01,330 --> 01:59:02,163
I feel like there's less,
and I don't think it's just the 

2845
01:59:05,561 --> 01:59:07,750
activity,
just this cars.

2846
01:59:07,751 --> 01:59:10,840
And I think it's the actual amount of 
humans in an area.

2847
01:59:10,841 --> 01:59:14,770
Like there's some sort of a psychic 
energy that they give off.

2848
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:18,520
You're not,
Jamie's not buying it either.

2849
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:20,950
Maybe the which we have our tree.
Ha Ha.

2850
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:22,390
Maurice Thompson.
I knew it.

2851
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:25,240
I had that book.
He teen 78.

2852
01:59:25,241 --> 01:59:27,850
Wow.
What is witchery?

2853
01:59:27,851 --> 01:59:30,790
Is that a real word I told you I was 
right.

2854
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:31,653
You were right.
I've redeemed five out of five stars in 

2855
01:59:34,751 --> 01:59:36,820
Barnes and noble,
but it's a good book.

2856
01:59:36,910 --> 01:59:39,280
Wow.
So it's in Barnes and noble.

2857
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:40,550
Yes.
Um,

2858
01:59:40,670 --> 01:59:42,910
can I get it on a kindle finder if I can
get it on kindle?

2859
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:46,510
Yeah.
Witchery of archery.

2860
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:49,480
It's speaking of a whole different,
um,

2861
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:52,530
I dunno what you just said,
but I'm going to be it.

2862
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,880
I'll be in Iq.
Look cubicle tomorrow.

2863
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:55,751
No,
you want it.

2864
01:59:55,751 --> 01:59:57,610
You've got to quit that job,
dude today.

2865
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:59,080
Yeah.
Should I just call right now?

2866
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:02,110
Let me call for you.
Oh yeah.

2867
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:04,090
You're my manager and your manager,
Kendall.

2868
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:05,680
Nice.
Five 99.

2869
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:06,880
I'm getting it.
Thank you.

2870
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:07,810
Thank you.
On Jamie,

2871
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:08,733
the witchery of archery and if my 
fucking kindle and I tried to enter it 

2872
02:00:10,991 --> 02:00:11,591
in,
he's like,

2873
02:00:11,591 --> 02:00:12,460
nope,
nothing exists.

2874
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:13,323
I'm like,
listen bitch,

2875
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,870
I've already gone through this.
All right.

2876
02:00:16,871 --> 02:00:17,704
Yeah.
It's so crazy that you keep a full time 

2877
02:00:18,911 --> 02:00:19,960
job.
It's just a,

2878
02:00:19,961 --> 02:00:20,794
I don't understand how you do it.
And that's also where a lot of people 

2879
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:26,500
that get involved in hunting,
the amount of time that it takes,

2880
02:00:26,501 --> 02:00:28,390
like people don't have the time.

2881
02:00:28,690 --> 02:00:29,523
Like I was,
I was listening to Jason Carter on some 

2882
02:00:31,571 --> 02:00:32,404
podcasts who's talking about pursuing 
one individual buck for like two weeks 

2883
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:37,173
and I was like,
Oh fuck is two weeks ago after one 

2884
02:00:39,221 --> 02:00:40,990
animal.
Like this is crazy.

2885
02:00:41,470 --> 02:00:44,290
Who's got that kind of time only like a 
real,

2886
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:47,420
like crazy before people pro type 
character.

2887
02:00:47,421 --> 02:00:48,340
Yeah,
yeah,

2888
02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:49,990
yeah.
That's it.

2889
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:51,220
It takes time.
I mean,

2890
02:00:51,221 --> 02:00:53,700
it's just,
even just the dedication to,

2891
02:00:53,810 --> 02:00:56,320
to regular practice takes time for 
archery,

2892
02:00:56,920 --> 02:01:01,300
but that's the next level.
There is no mean archery is,

2893
02:01:01,301 --> 02:01:02,830
uh,
it's,

2894
02:01:03,070 --> 02:01:04,900
it really is.
In terms of hunting,

2895
02:01:04,901 --> 02:01:08,260
it really is the ultimate pursuit,
the ultimate in difficulty.

2896
02:01:08,290 --> 02:01:10,150
But that's what I stopped at the 
compound thing.

2897
02:01:10,151 --> 02:01:10,984
People go to troy,
traditional archery component or truce 

2898
02:01:12,941 --> 02:01:15,940
for pussies settled down.
Yeah.

2899
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:18,430
And that was enough fiber kill killer 
with a rock.

2900
02:01:18,490 --> 02:01:19,600
How about you kill it with a rock layer?

2901
02:01:19,610 --> 02:01:20,800
Cake person did.
Oh,

2902
02:01:20,830 --> 02:01:21,880
you wearing shoes.
Pussy.

2903
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,400
I always wanted to wear shoes.
I always want to drink.

2904
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,061
Yeah,
I know.

2905
02:01:25,061 --> 02:01:26,780
I always wondered how anybody would kill
it.

2906
02:01:26,781 --> 02:01:27,614
The recurve where I was hunting,
because I said my 245 feet per second 

2907
02:01:30,641 --> 02:01:31,810
bolus slow.
Right.

2908
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,390
That'd be super fast for a traditional 
bow.

2909
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,650
Oh yeah.
So I mean,

2910
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:38,230
I could imagine with this deer,
they'd just,

2911
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,040
I dunno.
It'd be very tough.

2912
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,410
Very tough here.
You probably could.

2913
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:44,160
Oh wait,
you didn't know you were there.

2914
02:01:44,161 --> 02:01:44,994
Yeah.
Yeah.

2915
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:49,070
But it sounds like the area you were in,
they were very unnaturally hyped up,

2916
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:50,153
like unnaturally wired because there've 
been hunted by so many people think 

2917
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:53,953
they're just normally wired,
but when people kill them is when 

2918
02:01:56,511 --> 02:01:57,770
they're writing.
Um,

2919
02:01:57,771 --> 02:01:58,604
you know,
so you're distracted because there it's 

2920
02:01:59,931 --> 02:02:01,140
a breeding season.
Yeah.

2921
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:02,023
So this is post Rut.
Those bucks are not even with dose at 

2922
02:02:05,361 --> 02:02:06,260
all.
And there,

2923
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:07,760
you know,
just,

2924
02:02:08,150 --> 02:02:10,460
just tuned in.
But during the ride it would,

2925
02:02:10,510 --> 02:02:14,330
it would be easier just be like hunting 
elk during the road as opposed to not,

2926
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:16,520
or honey you do to the club with a 
boner.

2927
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:19,460
Right.
People get distracted.

2928
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:22,220
I've never hunted a dude with a button.
I'm glad.

2929
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:24,020
I'm glad to hear that.
I was wondering.

2930
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:25,543
I have questions and sometimes I get,
I beat around the Bush to get to the 

2931
02:02:28,911 --> 02:02:32,200
answer all I got.
I got what you're doing right then.

2932
02:02:35,230 --> 02:02:36,930
Yeah,
it is this,

2933
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:37,773
this,
it's funny how these different animals 

2934
02:02:39,261 --> 02:02:42,150
have like different seasons that they 
come into.

2935
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:45,230
Like the idea that only one time a year 
they breed,

2936
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:47,270
like there are a mammal.
It's not like a dog.

2937
02:02:47,271 --> 02:02:51,800
Like dogs want to fuck all the time,
but like deer one time a year.

2938
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:53,570
Yeah.
Everything starts on hop in.

2939
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:54,860
Nature says,
listen,

2940
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,050
this is how it works.
You want to have a baby in the spring.

2941
02:02:57,190 --> 02:02:59,300
It's a way to do this.
You gotta do it in the fall.

2942
02:02:59,360 --> 02:02:59,751
Yeah.
Okay.

2943
02:02:59,751 --> 02:03:04,070
In the fall you got to get cracking and 
then she's got take some time to cook up

2944
02:03:04,071 --> 02:03:06,470
that baby and dropped that baby in the 
spring.

2945
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:09,500
And then,
but it's bizarre.

2946
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:12,170
Yeah.
There's actually some bucks that were,

2947
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:14,940
they call it croaking,
which is grunting cause um,

2948
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:16,933
they weren't really the full Rut,
but some doughs that didn't get bread 

2949
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:21,620
the first season.

2950
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,960
If they don't get bread,
they come back into heat.

2951
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:26,930
They,
we call them second cycle dose.

2952
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:28,520
They were coming in.
So the bucks,

2953
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:29,503
I mean they'll,
they'll do it whenever they just got to 

2954
02:03:30,591 --> 02:03:34,490
wait for the female.
So the bucks were actually still sort of

2955
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:35,324
writing a little bit.
We heard some croaking so that was full 

2956
02:03:38,570 --> 02:03:39,081
on.
No,

2957
02:03:39,081 --> 02:03:41,300
there's just a few doughs that hadn't 
been bred.

2958
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:43,730
Well that's one of the coolest things 
about elk hunting.

2959
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:47,150
There's nothing like the Rut when you 
hear elk screaming.

2960
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:49,790
Like if the people have never 
experienced that before,

2961
02:03:49,791 --> 02:03:50,624
even if you have no desire to hunt,
please go to a place where elk live 

2962
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:55,130
during the Rut.
Just to hear it.

2963
02:03:55,190 --> 02:03:57,560
Cause it is insane.
So wild.

2964
02:03:57,561 --> 02:03:58,394
Yeah,
there is so loud and the sound sounds 

2965
02:04:00,711 --> 02:04:02,240
like something from the Lord of the 
rings.

2966
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:03,620
Yeah.
It doesn't even seem real.

2967
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:05,050
And you're going to be in Utah this 
year.

2968
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:06,010
Ooh.
Yay.

2969
02:04:06,050 --> 02:04:09,200
Remember that?
I'm very excited.

2970
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:10,010
Yeah.
Well,

2971
02:04:10,010 --> 02:04:12,230
we're definitely going to film some 
stuff there.

2972
02:04:12,610 --> 02:04:13,910
We're definitely going to film some 
stuff.

2973
02:04:13,911 --> 02:04:15,330
We'll do some instagram stories.
We'll,

2974
02:04:15,470 --> 02:04:16,303
we'll,
we'll definitely get some footage and 

2975
02:04:18,321 --> 02:04:19,154
we're definitely,
and when we got some footage from last 

2976
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:23,700
year when you and I were into hone ranch
that I put up on Instagram,

2977
02:04:23,730 --> 02:04:24,563
some elk screaming,
we we're pretty far away or a couple of 

2978
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:27,493
hundred yards away and it's wide open.
Whereas Utah's a little bit more wooded 

2979
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:32,510
and we'll try to get a little bit 
closer.

2980
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:34,630
Yeah,
those bulls will be coming close.

2981
02:04:34,730 --> 02:04:37,260
I'm very excited.
I can't wait either.

2982
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,660
I can't wait just to see you.
I can't wait.

2983
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:41,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

2984
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:42,870
I mean,
thanks for introducing me to this man.

2985
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:45,270
It's changed my life.
Really has.

2986
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:46,343
It's been,
it's been great to share it with you 

2987
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:48,263
and,
and it's been great to have you on to 

2988
02:04:49,771 --> 02:04:52,440
share it with other people and just 
share not just that,

2989
02:04:52,441 --> 02:04:56,610
but your entire disciplined approach to 
this whole lifestyle that you live.

2990
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,550
I think it's very inspiring to people 
and think it's very important.

2991
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,713
And,
uh,

2992
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:02,700

2994
