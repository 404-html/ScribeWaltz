1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,640
How do I pronounce your name?
Calling on the war.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,800
Colianni.
Okay.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,500
Yeah.
Now there's a conspiracy out there.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,230
Okay.
I made this name up.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,200
We'll talk about that.
We're talking about that.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,910
We're live already.
How'd you do that so quickly?

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,440
Oh,
you're a wizard.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,880
What's the conspiracy about your.
Your name is on noir.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,120
What's the conspiracy about your name?
That I made it up to hide who I really 

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,120
was.
Oh,

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,130
type shit.
Like I'm like,

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,540
everybody gets to have pseudonyms except
for me when you're talking about guns,

13
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,480
you don't get to have pseudonyms.
Did you have a different name?

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,530
Yeah,
my name is collins.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,400
Oh,
okay.

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,450
So you did change the name?
Yeah,

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,480
I did.
But there's a conspiracy behind you 

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:46,480
changed your name,
but that's not real.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,220
You just decided you wanted a different 
name.

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,320
I got into guns and I wanted to start 
watching gun videos and so I wanted to 

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,841
make a youtube channel and I didn't want
to use my real name because I thought 

22
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:59,991
that wasn't cool enough.
And so I said your name wasn't cooling 

23
00:00:59,991 --> 00:00:59,991
to know I didn't want to,
uh,

24
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:01,200
African American thing.
Yeah,

25
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:02,020
pretty much.
Yeah,

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,470
I mean I know comedians had changed 
their names,

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,360
like earthquake.

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,620
Earthquake is fucking hilarious.
Convenient man.

29
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,900
He's hilarious.
But a white dude couldn't call them self

30
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:14,630
or earthquake.
Hey,

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,230
good.
Nah You could.

32
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:19,740
But nobody would wrestler.
That was a restaurant name earthquake.

33
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,300
But that's different.
That's different.

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,460
That's a big giant guy.
Right.

35
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,080
So what's your original name?
What's your actual full original name?

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,510
I'll give you my first name.
I'll just,

37
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,130
I just don't want to make it easy for 
people to show the um,

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,570
Collins Collins and around it.
Yeah,

39
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,720
it's a fine name.
Something wrong with that.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's wrong with it?
Why that name bother you to the point 

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
where you didn't want to have it on?
No,

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,430
I just thought it'd be more fun to just 
come up with a pseudonym for my youtube 

43
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,511
channel.
I didn't start my youtube channel 

44
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:50,511
thinking,
all right,

45
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,121
I'm going to start this channel and I'm 
going to build this whole brand behind 

46
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:53,121
that.

47
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:53,640
No,
it was just for fun.

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,020
Yeah.
My friends call me.

49
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,790
One of my friends,
he called me killer corleone.

50
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,630
Right.
That was kind of a little nickname that 

51
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:03,630
I had.
And so I was like,

52
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,471
okay,
well just use going on and then I'm 

53
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:06,471
like,
I'm always in black.

54
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:06,600
Why did he call you killer cold?
No idea.

55
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,220
When I talked to him to this day,
I still don't know why he called me 

56
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,220
that.
Yeah,

57
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,220
there's nicknames,
man.

58
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,690
That just happens sometimes there is a 
rapper and Houston by that name.

59
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,640
Killer corleone.
Yeah.

60
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,300
Oh,
okay.

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,240
Yeah.
Um,

62
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,290
so I don't know if maybe he listened to 
him and then my name Collins and then 

63
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,090
called me on and so forth and so on.
Yeah.

64
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,170
So,
so how did you get wrapped up with the 

65
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,600
NRA?
So we should,

66
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,350
we should cover a couple of things here.
The origin story.

67
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Yeah.
So you're kind of like a spokesperson 

68
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:39,540
for the NRA,
not official spokesperson,

69
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,620
not official.
Unofficial.

70
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,080
Today.
You are a member of the NRA.

71
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,720
Do they recognize you?
Do they appreciate you?

72
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:46,770
Like how does that work?
Okay.

73
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:49,680
So the way it started,
I mean,

74
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,010
I'm going to start from the beginning.
Okay.

75
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,880
Alright.
So,

76
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,030
um,
my had a friend of mine,

77
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:56,070
a good friend of mine who called me up 
one day and was like,

78
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,470
do you want to go shooting?
And I was like,

79
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,980
because at the time I really wasn't pro 
gun and this was about,

80
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:06,130
I was around 24,
I'm 34,

81
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,190
so this is 10 years ago and I hesitate a
little bit because my background growing

82
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:18,361
up,
like I didn't grow up with guns in the 

83
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:18,361
house,
um,

84
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:21,070
no one in my family had a gun and for me
the idea and the notion of being a young

85
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,750
black male with a gun,
it's always,

86
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,120
I only saw three exactly through the 
lens of,

87
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,770
you know,
Gang Banger,

88
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:28,300
drug dealer,
so forth and so on.

89
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,810
So that's the mindset I had when with 
respect to firearms,

90
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,640
I'm unconsciously,
right.

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,760
I didn't even realize it wasn't even 
conscious of it until I started getting 

92
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:38,760
into this very heavy and realized,
okay,

93
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,021
wow.
I was thinking like that didn't realize 

94
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:43,021
it.
And so,

95
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,691
but at the same time I told myself,
why am I afraid of essentially what is 

96
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,750
an inanimate object?
Right.

97
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,550
So I think to myself,
I'm like,

98
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,170
all right,
I really don't want to go,

99
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,510
I'm a little terrified,
but you know what,

100
00:03:55,511 --> 00:04:00,511
I'm going to go ahead and do it.
And so I remember getting to the range,

101
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,670
we get to the range and we walk them 
through the door and then I hear the 

102
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,600
door for where the actual bays are and I
heard a pop pop,

103
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,370
pop go off and I'm like,
holy crap,

104
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:14,371
this is actually happening.
And so I kind of had this nervousness 

105
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:14,371
but I'm with my friend,
right?

106
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:15,460
And so I don't want my friend to feel 
like,

107
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,870
okay,
you're acting kind of like a bitch.

108
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,400
Right.
So I kind of kept it to myself.

109
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,020
You get to the counter,
we do all the paperwork that,

110
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,090
you know,
represent paperwork,

111
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:26,930
like billy phones all that.
Um,

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,990
and he has his gun,
we get to Malmo,

113
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,260
we go to the lane,
I remember it was the very last lane,

114
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,350
it was a,
maybe the range was top gun in Houston 

115
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,740
and so we go to very last range.
It gives me kind of like a brief 

116
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:40,840
instruction about how to shoot the gun.
How to load it,

117
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,660
so forth and so on.
And so at that point,

118
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,260
remember picking up the gun,
terrified not knowing what to expect,

119
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,140
not knowing what was gonna happen.
So I remember picking it up.

120
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,150
It was a little tourist ptsd,
11 1:11

121
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,160
millennium in 40 caliber.
And this was a subcompact probably not 

122
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,180
the best first time shooting the fucking
gun.

123
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Well,
the gun itself was small caliber 

124
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:06,640
example.
Lot of kick you.

125
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,200
Exactly.
So my experience,

126
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,630
anybody who watched that as a gun person
would be like,

127
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:11,360
oh,
this is not gonna end.

128
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:11,530
Well.

129
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,090
So I remember standing at the bay and 
then taking a gun and pointing it and 

130
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,730
shooting it.
And I remember just the concussive 

131
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,350
force,
the explosion,

132
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,860
the gun dancing in my hand.
And I was like,

133
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,690
holy crap.
That was terrifying.

134
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,520
They're to shout it again.
I was like,

135
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:38,521
I liked this shit.
And the weird thing is it not in a way 

136
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:42,190
that most people think the nerdy aspect 
of my brain kicked in,

137
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,390
right?
I'm like,

138
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,660
holy crap.
Like I'm taking this project down.

139
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,370
I'm launching it right several feet.
Um,

140
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,940
and I just,
the second shot allowed me to realize 

141
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,231
what just happened.
I just contained an explosion in my 

142
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:58,231
hand.
Right?

143
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm like,
if you don't find that amazing,

144
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,990
you don't have a pulse.
It's amazing.

145
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,100
The thing that people are bothered by is
what comes with it and how people use 

146
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:13,271
it.
And I think an analogy that's a fair 

147
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:17,531
analogy,
but people reject is driving cars and a 

148
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:19,760
lot of these fucking psychos that have 
been running over people in the street.

149
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,990
I mean,
it just happened again,

150
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,030
Perlin somewhere somewhere in Germany.
Some guy ran a bunch of people over and 

151
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,890
then blew his brains out.
It's,

152
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,540
it's an object,
right?

153
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,110
It's a thing that you use.
And I'm a huge car guy to Sam as well.

154
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

155
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:38,531
I love cars.
I mean if someone said we have to ban 

156
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:38,531
cars because people started running 
people over with cars,

157
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,830
they'd be like,
well,

158
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,830
okay,
I think we're dealing with a whole bunch

159
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,380
of problems.
And there's,

160
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,170
there's a bunch of things that I think 
we will probably agree on.

161
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,920
One of the things we can agree on is all
these mass shootings are horrific.

162
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,630
Absolutely.
They're terrifying.

163
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,670
It's.
It's an evil,

164
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,300
terrible thing that here's another 
thing.

165
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,720
No NRA members are doing that.
That's one of the things that's really 

166
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,390
kind of fucked up about people getting 
angry at the NRA.

167
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Yeah.
We've never had a mass shooting ever 

168
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,450
that,
that I can recall that was done by an 

169
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:14,450
NRA member.
I looked.

170
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,711
I tried to find one.
I can't find a mass shooting that was 

171
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:19,580
perpetrated by an MRI NRA member and I 
think it's.

172
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,580
So the biggest problem that a lot of gun
owners,

173
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:27,581
especially NRA members have,
is like the conversation that's being 

174
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:31,211
had is basically coloring or actually 
forgetting the human element behind 

175
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,150
those three letters.
Like the NRA isn't like this demigod 

176
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,560
that just sits in the cloud of Olympia 
and it is just one big guy that just 

177
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:40,820
orchestrating this entire thing.

178
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,790
Yeah.
It's,

179
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,190
you're talking 5 million people,
you know?

180
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,320
Right.
Like I'm a,

181
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,430
I'm,
I'm a member,

182
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,600
I am a gun owner.
Right.

183
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:52,601
That that's who I am along with 5 
million other people who were that way 

184
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:56,741
and then there were a ton of other 
people who think they're in our members 

185
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,290
in art and then a ton of other people 
who probably don't mind being an Ra 

186
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,321
members,
they just haven't gotten around with 

187
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:02,690
doing it and getting the membership and 
the vast majority of those people.

188
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,750
And I'm saying that just to be safe.
They're good people.

189
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,050
I think there's quite a few good people,
um,

190
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,650
the people that are perpetrated,
all these mass shootings are definitely 

191
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,160
not good people.
But what's wrong with them?

192
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,720
Well,
I'll tell you what's wrong with them.

193
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,050
Guns not guns that are wrong with them.
They use the guns to express what's 

194
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:23,750
wrong with them.

195
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,170
You know,
and everybody wants to look at the 

196
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:29,170
object,
which I get what's easier?

197
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Well,
it is easier and it's something that 

198
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,180
everyone's pointing to.
Like,

199
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,480
why do you need an Ar 15?
Why do you need to do this?

200
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,970
Why didn't you do that?
These are good questions.

201
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,580
Why do you need these things?
Why do I need that Fucking Samurai sword

202
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:41,860
over there?
I don't know,

203
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,710
it's like what do you need?
And that's another thing too though,

204
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,270
and I've said it before,
I think we are a victim of our own 

205
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,270
success in this country,
right?

206
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,370
I do think this is the greatest country 
in the world,

207
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,500
but the problem with that is is

208
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,250
this country was built on an ideological
foundation that I think it aids in that 

209
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,600
our ability to be as great as we are,
but we live in a world now where people 

210
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
don't see the necessity for something 
that was never,

211
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,800
that was never supposed to be seen 
through the lens of necessity in the 

212
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,961
first place.
The Second Amendment doesn't give me a 

213
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:17,661
right.
It preserves something that already 

214
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:17,661
existed,
but what happens is we have a culture of

215
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:22,521
people who don't,
who look at the second amendment as a 

216
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:22,521
privilege,
not a right there,

217
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,330
look at it as a privilege.
So that's why they say,

218
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,380
well,
why do you need that?

219
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,390
Why do you need more than 10 rounds?
Why do you need this?

220
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:29,070
Why do you need that?
And I'm like,

221
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,670
first of all,
reframing the entire conversation 

222
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,310
underneath when that's not what the 
second amendment is about.

223
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,730
It's a right that I've already had.
It's a natural right that I had the 

224
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,280
moment that I stepped foot on this earth
as a person.

225
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,890
The right to self defense is,
is universal.

226
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,100
Yeah.
And the people say,

227
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,660
okay,
it's a right,

228
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,360
but obviously there's a problem so we 
have to do something about it.

229
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,590
So you're going to have to give up your 
guns.

230
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,070
This is,
this is the common conversation and it's

231
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,690
very flippant and it's not well thought 
out and there's no,

232
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,840
no consideration whatsoever to mental 
health issues.

233
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,250
I think because I think this is.
I think that's the primary problem 

234
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:09,960
that's.
I've been saying this from the get go.

235
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:14,961
I think it's the primary problem.
I think it's a mental health issue and 

236
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:14,961
people say,
oh,

237
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,080
that's simplifying it.
I don't think it is.

238
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,050
I think it's the opposite.
I think it's,

239
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,860
it's ignored it.
Look,

240
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,240
it's there's something wrong when you 
have this many people on mental health 

241
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,571
medication.
And then when you look at the number of 

242
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:29,880
mass shooters,
it's almost universal.

243
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,720
Almost every single one of them is on 
some sort of psychiatric medication.

244
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,990
But that's not a part of the narrative.
That's not a part of the conversation.

245
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:38,790
The conversation is always get rid of 
guns.

246
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,120
Now I don't want crazy people to have 
guns.

247
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,570
I don't think you do either.
No,

248
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,600
don't.
So outside of taking away the rights to 

249
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:54,060
have guns from normal law abiding people
like yourself and myself,

250
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:56,010
I have guns.
What,

251
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,990
what do we do?
Okay.

252
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,230
So first of all,
I think we need to frame the 

253
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,230
conversation and into specifics,
right?

254
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,240
You're a lawyer,
right?

255
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:03,970
I am.
Okay.

256
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:08,971
Yeah.
So you understand bills and amendments 

257
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:08,971
and law.
Okay.

258
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,340
And so I think one word lumping the 
entire conversation in one category,

259
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,430
right?
If we're going to talk about school 

260
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,430
shootings,
let's talk about school shootings,

261
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,490
right?
So the first thing I say is,

262
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,990
because for one thing,
a lot of people in it,

263
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:24,960
so I'd like to say is,
well you guys just don't want any

264
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,220
gun laws and you say no to everything,
but you have no true.

265
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,730
But to stand up for that,
it's because all they want to do is take

266
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:34,670
away the guns.
Yeah.

267
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,790
They're saying,
let's take away the guns.

268
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,140
You're saying we're not going to take 
away the guns.

269
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,060
You guys just don't want to get your 
guns taken away.

270
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,130
Yes,
you're right.

271
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,190
You're right.
No one wants to get their guns take 

272
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,131
away.
And then I get labeled a monster as a 

273
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:49,531
result of saying exactly.
You want kids to die and it's a fucking 

274
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:50,200
real sneaky conversations.
Disingenuous.

275
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,980
Yes it is.
And that's the odd thing about

276
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,980
it is it's you see anybody who's paying 
attention to the discourse in way it's 

277
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,710
happening.
Especially on social media.

278
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,210
Right.
Anybody who follows my twitter,

279
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,510
my twitter account knows this multiple 
occasions I've tried to have a rational 

280
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:12,091
conversation with people who are on the 
complete opposite side of my spectrum 

281
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:13,030
of,
of this issue.

282
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,700
Is there any of this online or like 
debates or anything like that?

283
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,270
Well,
no,

284
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,670
I mean it's just on twitter.
Tweets going back and forth.

285
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,460
Didn't do anything rational.
You can occasionally,

286
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,510
you got the American people being 
friendly.

287
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,140
You wouldn't see me flustered,
respond to me rationally because I'm 

288
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,320
always,
you know,

289
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,340
had this right of course,
and I actually have to check myself 

290
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,441
about that a little bit because how am I
any better than the people on the other 

291
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:43,651
side if I had the same at the same 
energy that they have towards me.

292
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,060
That's a very good point.
And so I've started,

293
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,020
you know what,
let me,

294
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,080
because I can be incredibly snarky like 
I can and it's partly due because of my 

295
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,540
friends.
They're all assholes,

296
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,620
just like all the friends I grew up 
with.

297
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:03,880
I grew up arguing with a group of guys 
who when they were losing it logically,

298
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,200
they went to jokes.
Right?

299
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,670
And it's like a man pretty much,
right?

300
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,590
It took me a second to realize it 
because I was the one in law school,

301
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:16,591
right?
I was the one that was going to law 

302
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:16,591
school,
law,

303
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:18,650
all that stuff.
So everything I did was focused and 

304
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:18,650
center through the idea of logic,
logic,

305
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,501
logic.
You're not making any sense and you 

306
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,260
crack a joke and everyone's laughing and
I realized there's some power to that.

307
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,620
Right.
You know,

308
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,700
humor,
I mean you should know something about 

309
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:29,700
that.
Just a little for sure.

310
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,150
Yeah,
and so I took on some of those qualities

311
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,630
in the way that I advocate for firearms,
you know,

312
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,720
because it can be a little disarming,
but the disarming aspect of it can be 

313
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,441
beneficial because it causes people to 
drop their guard a little bit and then 

314
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,580
when you drop your guard you can take in
information more objectively,

315
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,090
more so than waiting or looking for 
confirmation bias or in instigating your

316
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:56,221
cognitive dissonance because you just 
don't want to hear the thing that is 

317
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:56,221
contrary to what you already believe.

318
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:58,190
I just think you need a lot of 
character,

319
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,390
like as a person to be able to 
communicate reasonably on twitter and 

320
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,460
there's a lot of people that are just 
lacking that.

321
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:08,810
So it's almost like the ability to steal
and no one's looking the ability to shit

322
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:11,090
on someone with no ida,
eye contact,

323
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,200
no social repercussions.
No know you're not feeling anything from

324
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,780
that person.
You say something rude to them.

325
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,190
They're not in front of you,
so you don't feel terrible saying that.

326
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:19,890
Yeah.
No,

327
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,170
it's,
I'm not gonna lie,

328
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,970
so twitter isn't dirty place,
it's a dirty place,

329
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,310
but it's a great place to.
Sometimes it is,

330
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,590
it has its benefits,
right.

331
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,060
There's some really good conversations 
to be had on twitter and I've had a 

332
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,930
really interesting moments on twitter 
where I've learned a lot about things 

333
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,570
where people have sent me links and I've
retweeted them and I've,

334
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,080
I've learned a lot of things,
but it's hard sometimes,

335
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:50,081
man,
because there are so many people that 

336
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:51,440
are just unreasonable and they're not 
good at communicating and they're happy.

337
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
They're not happy people and does a lot 
of people out there that just aren't 

338
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:56,500
happy man.
It's,

339
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
you know,
and it'd be honest with you,

340
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:02,501
I didn't realize it until I got to the 
notoriety that I am now in the space 

341
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:02,510
that I'm in.
Well,

342
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:05,930
you're in a weird space because you're 
in the space of defending guns,

343
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,490
you know,
and I'm black.

344
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,530
Yeah.
And I'm relatively young.

345
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,720
Yeah.
There's a lot going on there.

346
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,670
And we were a lawyer and I worked well.

347
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,140
They tend to disregard that.
Well,

348
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,910
they should probably pay attention.
Well,

349
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:19,370
it doesn't matter because I have,
I'm doing,

350
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,820
I'm advocating also with certain three 
letters behind me.

351
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,150
They automatically assume as the devil 
for now.

352
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,560
How does the NRA feel about you?
Do you know?

353
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,210
I mean,
do you have conversations with them?

354
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:34,211
Are they saying good job or they.
Are they pleased or as far as I can 

355
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:34,211
tell,
they are.

356
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,790
We still have the relationship we have.
It's very much a very symbiotic 

357
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,971
relationship.
It's a weird one right now because it's 

358
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:42,971
like,
this is what I hear from the NRA.

359
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:45,650
I hear colon and then I hear Ted nugent.

360
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,680
Those are the two that I hear it.
I gotta be honest.

361
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:56,681
I'm not,
I'm not the biggest fan of Ted 

362
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:56,681
techniques rhetoric.
Um,

363
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:57,890
but I do know where it's coming from.
But then again,

364
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,930
I didn't grow up listening to Ted 
nugent.

365
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,940
Yeah,
that's not my demographic,

366
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,840
but at the same time to a new job,
it's still an individual and people fail

367
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,010
to understand that.
Like we,

368
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,790
like,
we may be monolithic on that,

369
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,880
on the issue of firearms.
We're not monolithic in the way we go 

370
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:14,880
about expressing it.
Well,

371
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,121
he's right about things.
Just because someone's outrageous 

372
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,840
doesn't mean they're not right.
Like if you ever seen his,

373
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:21,430
uh,
the,

374
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,120
the debate that he had in a gun store 
with the Piers Morgan.

375
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,570
Yeah.
No,

376
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,140
the funny thing is to do just incredibly
bright.

377
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,120
It is smart guy.
Crazy as hell.

378
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,410
I don't even think he's crazy.

379
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,420
I do.
You can only.

380
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,610
You can only kill so many things for 
you.

381
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:42,350
Lose your fucking marbles.
Ted Lives on a ranch in Texas where it's

382
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,900
all fenced in.
He's just shooting all animals.

383
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,140
He hunts every day.
He's a psycho and I don't,

384
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,660
with all due respect,
I'm a big fan of strangle hold.

385
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,680
So what,
so how,

386
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,800
what's,
where's the line of demarcation between 

387
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,081
becoming and not hurting enough in terms
of becoming a crossing over that line 

388
00:16:59,081 --> 00:16:59,850
into,
into sociopath?

389
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,280
Well,
I'm just joking.

390
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,820
I'm a hunter.
I mean it really depends entirely upon 

391
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,220
what he's doing with the meat.
And I know he gives it to hunters for 

392
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,071
the hungry.
I know he gives it to neighbors and 

393
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:12,670
friends and there's nothing wrong with 
that.

394
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,500
And he asked.
He actually has a,

395
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,130
he has an obligation to be the steward 
of his land because he has a lot of 

396
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,740
exotic and stuff and I'm just totally 
joking around.

397
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,100
Oh No,
I know.

398
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,170
But when you,
um,

399
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,190
when you listen to his conversation with
Piers Morgan,

400
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:33,380
which Piers Morgan takes that flip in,
left wing knee jerk reactionary,

401
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,030
you know,
regionally paragons.

402
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah,
he's a cunt.

403
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,050
And when,
when he's on with Ted,

404
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,980
Ted just knew everything about the 
actual facts.

405
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:45,770
When you start running around with 
statistics of gun violence,

406
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:50,771
he's like,
do you know how many of those people 

407
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:50,771
were bad guys that were shot cops?
Yeah.

408
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:54,980
Do you know how many of those people 
were people that were shot when they 

409
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,151
were breaking the people's homes?
Do you know how many of those people 

410
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:57,151
were people that were killed in self 
defense?

411
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:57,250
There's a lot.
Yeah,

412
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,140
it's not in the,
you know,

413
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:00,030
how many of those people,
when you say talking about gun violence,

414
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,650
how many of the people were suicide?
Uh,

415
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,700
yeah,
there's a lot.

416
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,070
Keep in mind that's recent suicide.
Well,

417
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:07,320
no.
So here's what happened.

418
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,740
So when I started getting really deep 
into the advocacy component of it,

419
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,710
the everyone was screaming,
30,000

420
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,080
people die from gun violence,
30,000

421
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:17,880
people a day.
That's what they were running with.

422
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,340
And they were scaring all the suburban 
House moms.

423
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,550
Oh my gosh.
We got to do something about gun 

424
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:25,550
control.
We got to do something about guns.

425
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,520
So I,
I jumped into the pool and I,

426
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,720
I,
I just like,

427
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:30,510
something doesn't seem right about that 
figure right now.

428
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,200
I'm not saying I'm is wrong about it.
It seemed inflated.

429
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,050
It seemed inflated.
I don't know what it was.

430
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,180
It's on a subconscious level as or 
maybe,

431
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,280
or maybe it was me looking for 
confirmation bias,

432
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,390
right?
Because I felt the way I did about 

433
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,390
farms,
I'll be honest and say that.

434
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,970
And so what I did is I kind of 
researched a little more than I realize 

435
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,630
holy shit,
over 65 percent of that 30,000

436
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,390
suicides,
65 percent real.

437
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,470
He's just Christ.
So what does that like 18,000

438
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,900
people a day shoot themselves,
man.

439
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,090
Something crazy like that.
What do we say at the top of the show?

440
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,140
And people are miserable,
man.

441
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,910
That's a fucking crazy number though,
man.

442
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:10,530
That's a Kevin Hart concerts pretty much
altogether.

443
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,790
Goodnight everybody.
Well that's really what it is.

444
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,470
18,000
people.

445
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,170
That's fucking incredible.
So then it.

446
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,260
But then it begs the question that you 
brought up before the mental health 

447
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,260
aspect.

448
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,260
Yeah.
How much?

449
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,010
How much?
How many lives would we actually save if

450
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:31,011
we took the same energy we applied to 
just making guns evil and trying to ban 

451
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:35,610
guns and take that energy and put it 
towards understanding what it is.

452
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,730
Why as a society we have a society that 
is so eager to really not want to be 

453
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,050
here anymore.
Hm.

454
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Expand that a little bit more.
Because we have all the guns in the 

455
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:48,840
universe here in America,
right?

456
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Compared to any other country.
But yet our suicide rates should be 

457
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,360
exceedingly higher than all the other 
countries that don't have as many guns.

458
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,640
But it's not the case.
Right.

459
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,110
You look at the UK,
you look at Japan,

460
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:03,480
Japan has double our suicide rate.
Does it really?

461
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,740
Oh yeah.
Double.

462
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,760
Yeah.
Wow.

463
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:10,761
So 60,000
people a day in Japan or whatever the 

464
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:10,761
fuck per year.
Smaller.

465
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:11,160
Not Everyday.
It's every year.

466
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:12,510
Yeah,
per annual.

467
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,020
One hundred 23.
But I said that you go complaint numbers

468
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,220
again.
I fucked up.

469
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,280
Did I say a day earlier or did I say a 
year?

470
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,360
Earlier.
A day?

471
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

472
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,960
Because you owe $30,000.
What did I say?

473
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,250
Day $30,000
a year.

474
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:29,430
Doesn't sound that bad because $300.
Million people.

475
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,760
Oh yeah.
So you would,

476
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,180
you would think about it predicated on,
on a daily basis?

477
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:33,570
No,
no,

478
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:33,840
no,
no.

479
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:34,920
Annually.
Annually.

480
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,980
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would I think that?

481
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,050
I think he might've said on accident 
too.

482
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,940
Oh really?
But everyone.

483
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,320
Thirty.
Yeah.

484
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,250
Thirty thousand pounds in a year from 
gun violence.

485
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,350
Call it gun gun fire.
But in reality you break those numbers 

486
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,350
down,
makes contact with San Francisco,

487
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,000
65 percent of those are suicides in 
about five percent of those are,

488
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:57,250
um,
are God dammit.

489
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,540
I think justified homicides including 
times when cops shoot someone in self 

490
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,470
defense and it's justified right in self
defense shooting.

491
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,290
So forth.
And so they count times when cops really

492
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,870
shouldn't have shot somebody,
but did,

493
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,220
I'm pretty sure they do.
Yeah.

494
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,930
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure they do.

495
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:17,470
But even then that number would be 
exceedingly marginal comparatively.

496
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Right?
So then you have the remaining number 

497
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:22,700
which are.
And then you have like three to five.

498
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,280
I know,
I think it was 15 percent of justified.

499
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Three to five percent are accidents.
Three to five percent a lot.

500
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,160
Yeah.
No,

501
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,960
it's with 900 people.
900 people a year.

502
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,640
Right.
So,

503
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,190
and I tweeted this,
I said again,

504
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,280
if we focused on firearm safety 
education,

505
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,660
we could,
that number will drop in half.

506
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,870
It might be you're not gonna,
you're gonna fix the intelligence level 

507
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,290
of the human.
See as fucking around with guns.

508
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:58,291
That's where you underestimate the fact 
in the nursemaid how those people are 

509
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,291
dying because accidentally,
because there were a lot of people who 

510
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,650
don't understand basic gun safety,
right?

511
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,300
Within that 900,
it's a lot of them.

512
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Um,
when you see some of the accidents that 

513
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,131
happens with firearms,
they're easily mitigated by just simply 

514
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:11,500
knowing the four rules of firearm 
ownership.

515
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,370
And when you get into the gun community,
like as a whole,

516
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,710
you follow that rabbit instance like we 
are,

517
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,120
we're crazy about gun safety.
You,

518
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:25,180
you,
you put your finger on a trigger and a 

519
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,180
picture.
We're slaughtering you.

520
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,540
Yeah.
Not Literally,

521
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,590
but you know what you're saying.
Yeah.

522
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:27,860
Like we're going to hold your 
accountability.

523
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,950
I have a friend who has so many guns.
He doesn't know how many guns.

524
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,220
How many guns you have.
I don't know Justin.

525
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,280
I know you're listening.
He's a legit gun.

526
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,500
Nut and great guy.
Yeah.

527
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,520
And I don't know how many guns I have,
either a fucking crazy person.

528
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,870
I mean hell,
I mean I guess.

529
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,430
I mean,
but then again I didn't shoot my first 

530
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:50,430
gun.

531
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:50,430
Toilet Twenty three,
24.

532
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:50,640
Yeah.
So that,

533
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:52,390
did that just become crazy all of a 
sudden?

534
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,200
I think I was about the same age.
Yeah.

535
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,950
Well,
I think I shot one when I was real young

536
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,340
and I definitely shot one in camp when I
was like,

537
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,150
I guess I was probably 12,
but at that I didn't count that I've 

538
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,150
shot my first handgun when I first came 
to California and I might've been really

539
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,590
on it.
Well,

540
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,270
what's ironic is it's way easier to get 
a gun here.

541
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:16,790
That is New York.
I lived in New York too.

542
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,310
Fucking hard to get a handgun in New 
York.

543
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:21,400
Almost impossible.
You legally?

544
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,690
You mean?
Legally or illegally?

545
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:23,260
Okay.
Yeah.

546
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,560
No,
I mean when I came here it was a 1994 I 

547
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:33,490
guess,
maybe 93,

548
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,730
94.
I bought a gun and I was like,

549
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:37,900
I can't believe I just buy a gun to the 
check.

550
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:38,670
Yeah,
yeah.

551
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,590
I bought A.
I'm about 38 special about a Walter p,

552
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:46,280
P K,
and I bought a glock nine millimeter

553
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,350
or made a good taste.
I'm a fan.

554
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm a fan of the PDK as well.
Yeah,

555
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,900
it's a cute little gun.
Well,

556
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:58,901
when I first came to California and her 
all this crazy shit about drive by 

557
00:23:58,901 --> 00:23:59,210
shootings and gang violence,
I just thought it was just going to be a

558
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:04,211
fucking war zone out here.
There's a funny thing about it is it's 

559
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:05,830
your natural disposition was I need 
something to protect myself.

560
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:11,290
It's such a natural thought process.
I don't know why we've perverted it to 

561
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:11,990
this deal where it's like something has 
to be wrong with you.

562
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:16,991
If you had that mentality or that 
there's a lot of people that haven't 

563
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:17,460
experienced real violence,
you know,

564
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,540
and then if you've experienced real 
violence and you've seen what happens 

565
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,510
when you have a terrible person around 
people that aren't terrible,

566
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,770
that's for sure.
That's a reality that people don't like 

567
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,630
to face and they don't like to look at 
the other side of the coin.

568
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,010
Like whenever there's an instance where 
there's a shooter,

569
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,220
the shooter gets taken out by someone 
who's a trained person who's trained 

570
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,260
with firearms and and knows tactics.
Nobody wants to talk about that.

571
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:46,910
That just gets brushed off.
They don't.

572
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,250
There's not a balanced conversation to 
be had.

573
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,280
There isn't an interesting thing is I 
have a group to have a group chat when 

574
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,330
stuff like that does happen,
they write it off as just anomalies.

575
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,920
Right?
How's that an anomaly?

576
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:59,840
That's what exactly what it's supposed 
to be used for.

577
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,430
Again,
like I said,

578
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,340
confirmation bias and cognitive and 
distances are,

579
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,540
are,
is a bitch.

580
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,970
We all suffer from it,
right?

581
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,030
To an extent.
For sure.

582
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:13,060
Um,
but when you add in the component of 

583
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,060
fear,
right?

584
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,760
For a lot of people,
they don't necessarily hate guns.

585
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,870
The sequences of being shot or someone 
they love being shot in.

586
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,020
One of the thing about it is though,
you know,

587
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,170
those people never put themselves in a 
position of being the shooter.

588
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,470
They always put themselves in a position
of being the victim of a shooting.

589
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,570
So that's why you get,
well,

590
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,610
why do you need that?
Because they don't see it as,

591
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:34,160
okay,
this allows me to better defend myself.

592
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,620
They look at it from the perspective of,
well,

593
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,470
if you're able to have that,
then you might use that against me.

594
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,910
And you know,
there's also the,

595
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,690
the looming specter of the mass shooter.
It's just so fucking common these days.

596
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:51,110
It seems like every three or four months
there's a new instance,

597
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,040
how many times per cent happened.
Perception is a bitch,

598
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,660
but the reality is the absolute reality 
is they have happened.

599
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,810
They are horrific and there's more of 
them here than anywhere else in the 

600
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:04,810
world.

601
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,560
That's reality,
but here's the good.

602
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,980
So when you say that you're talking 
about the developer world,

603
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,040
correct your,
because that's usually the caveat they 

604
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,171
like to play on.
There's no mass shootings in the 

605
00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:24,570
undeveloped world is people don't just 
go into a fucking mall and shoot people 

606
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:24,570
up.
What's windshield shade?

607
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,080
It's rare.
Very rare.

608
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,360
Where people take it happens more than 
people realize.

609
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,620
It just doesn't.
It just doesn't.

610
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,340
A report on how many people die in 
Chicago in a weekend,

611
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,860
over a weekend that doesn't get 
reported.

612
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,870
That's true,
but we live in America where we have 

613
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:39,870
complete access to information that is 
true,

614
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,440
but it's a different kind of violence 
because it's people that are actively to

615
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:45,210
get people that are actively trying to 
get them.

616
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,360
It's gang violence.
Whereas school shootings are completely 

617
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,610
innocent.
School shootings are the worst,

618
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:55,611
right?
Because it's a child and some fucking 

619
00:26:55,611 --> 00:26:58,221
psycho decides to make the most noise 
possible by going into a school and 

620
00:26:58,221 --> 00:26:58,221
shooting it up.

621
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:00,300
That's the scariest and the worst for 
most people.

622
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,700
For most.
When you think about gang violence,

623
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,420
you say,
well,

624
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,940
that's violent.
It's terrible that people got shot,

625
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,500
but it's people that are trying to shoot
each other.

626
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,620
All right,
so then when I tell you that the 

627
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,140
remaining homicides in this country,
right at 30,000

628
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:18,141
number that I gave you manually,
over 80 percent of that is gang 

629
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:19,910
violence.
That's crazy to think and believe it.

630
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,730
I believe you,
but it's when you see Sandy Hook,

631
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:28,731
when you see Parkland,
when you see any that the shooting in 

632
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:29,130
Colorado,
Aurora in the movie theater,

633
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,030
when you see these mass shootings,
these are what terrify people.

634
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:38,050
Yeah.
People are not necessarily terrified of 

635
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,050
the gang violence in Chicago.
You know,

636
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm going to Chicago in a couple of 
months and not one fucking person has 

637
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,200
brought up,
hey man,

638
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,230
it places a warzone.
Everybody's like,

639
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,190
oh,
I love Chicago.

640
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,570
You're going to get deep dish pizza like
nobody knows your fly.

641
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,580
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

642
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,580
No,
I'm not going to the south side.

643
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,540
Do.
See,

644
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,340
that's the thing.
I just went to Chicago.

645
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:55,110
It was just in Chicago.
I was here and they were like,

646
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:55,980
well,
you locked and loaded.

647
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,330
Did you wear a vest?
Yes,

648
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,900
I'm dead serious.
I got all those questions,

649
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:04,901
but I said I was going to Chicago.
Those are the first things that people 

650
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:04,901
told me.
Now,

651
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:05,570
granted I did go to south side.
I did feel like.

652
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,240
Yeah,
we did.

653
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,410
Would you.
Were you nervous?

654
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:09,120
Were you walking around?
I wasn't nervous.

655
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,130
I'm not superman man.
So when you're walking around,

656
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:14,160
he's strapped a not in Chicago because 
it's illegal for me to be.

657
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:19,310
That's what's crazy is that Chicago has 
really strict gun laws and that they 

658
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,560
don't work at all.

659
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,080
I was driving down a road where there 
were like six,

660
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:27,081
seven,
eight dudes who jumped in front of the 

661
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,941
car when we drove in there because we 
didn't look like we belonged there and 

662
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:29,580
I'm positive.
Every single one of them had a gun.

663
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,650
They jumped in front of the car.
Well,

664
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:34,290
they didn't like little lob,
their bodies in front of the car.

665
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:35,810
But you know,
you,

666
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,840
you said Carl,
this unfamiliar driving down the side 

667
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:40,840
streets.
So they tried to stop you.

668
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Uh,
they didn't try to stop me.

669
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,480
I think you're trying to figure out who 
the hell we were going over.

670
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:44,960
They were just trying to surface.
Yeah.

671
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,650
So it's kind,
Kinda one of those things,

672
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,610
right?
But then again,

673
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:52,611
when you're driving around,
you're driving down the side street and 

674
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:52,611
south side Chicago.
We go pros on the car.

675
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,070
Oh,
that's true.

676
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,100
Right.
So you kind of have that.

677
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,250
Um,
so we all agree that gun violence,

678
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,250
especially in terms of mass shootings is
one of the biggest problems that we have

679
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:08,610
in terms of like a horrific public image
problem,

680
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,720
right?
It's uh,

681
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,750
it's,
it's something that you see in 

682
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:14,750
everybody.
When I say public image,

683
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:14,790
I should,
what I should,

684
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,350
I should phrase that what I mean as a 
public perception problem.

685
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Like you,
you see it and it's just death and 

686
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,460
violence and children and innocence.
And we as,

687
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,490
as people I think consider the death of 
innocence to be one of the most 

688
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:34,510
egregious and horrific deaths.
So I think we both agree on.

689
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,490
Absolutely.
So.

690
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,540
So that's 100 percent across the board.
I think with any decent person.

691
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,590
These mass shootings are horrific.
I think in my opinion,

692
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,500
the,
the,

693
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,120
the number one aspect of the argument 
that's not being discussed is the mental

694
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,200
health aspect of it.

695
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,710
Are you opposed to more screening of 
people to get guns?

696
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,300
Yes and no.
Yes and no.

697
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,950
Yes.
In that,

698
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:04,951
in an ideal world,
if we could minority report it and 

699
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:04,951
figure it out.
Who you.

700
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:04,951
I mean,
minority report.

701
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:06,700
I mean just like check to see if they're
on metal,

702
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,440
mental health medication.
But I mean we,

703
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,730
we currently have.
We'll see.

704
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,200
Here's the thing,
this slippery slope with that too.

705
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,650
So what would constitute somebody being 
on mental health medication that's 

706
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:16,650
prohibitive,
but if I would,

707
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,110
if I deal with anxiety,
if I'm on Susanne's prescribed,

708
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,670
is that prevent me from owning a 
firearm?

709
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,640
That's a good question.
In California for the longest time,

710
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:27,070
they were trying to make it.
If you had a medical marijuana card,

711
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:29,260
you couldn't have a firearm.
I think they were doing that federally.

712
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:34,530
I think that there was a federal thing 
that if you had a legal medical 

713
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,981
marijuana card that they were trying to 
prevent people they were trying to 

714
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:37,981
prevent people from.

715
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:41,530
They were trying to be trying to cripple
the marijuana industry because they knew

716
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:43,810
that people wanted guns because to be 
honest,

717
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:46,120
it's intellectually dishonest.
If I can,

718
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:49,660
if I can go to the store with a gun on 
me and buy alcohol,

719
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,190
right?
Like,

720
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:51,840
and you know me,
I'm not,

721
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,600
I don't even smoke.
Right.

722
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,550
But let's just be honest about it.
Like alcohol,

723
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,820
weed.
I mean I think utilizing that as a 

724
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,220
prohibitive means to own a firearm.
I think it's.

725
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,770
I think that is true.
But if you were under the influence,

726
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,110
some of the Shit I got in the studio,
I.

727
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,570
No,
you're super paranoid.

728
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,070
I didn't undo a gun and say,
I didn't say under the influence.

729
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:17,170
I said if I could all the all the 
marijuana card.

730
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:18,580
Does this allow you to buy it?
No.

731
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:23,581
One hundred percent.
But I'm saying that is an issue if 

732
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:23,581
you're under the influence and you have 
a gun,

733
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:23,581
right?

734
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,310
Yeah.
But I'm allowed to.

735
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,980
But I have you go to my house right now.
I have all types of whiskeys at home.

736
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,400
Right.
But if you're under the influence,

737
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:30,930
right?
Yeah.

738
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,320
But yeah.
So I can't,

739
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:34,730
I can't carry a firearm and then drunk.
Right.

740
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,760
You can't,
you shouldn't be drunk with a gun.

741
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,650
You shouldn't be high as fuck when the 
gun.

742
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,590
Neither one of those good ideas.
And nor should you be driving.

743
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,920
Nor should you be driving.
So should you be on Xanax with a gun?

744
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,100
That's the question I don't know the 
answer to because I've never had xanax.

745
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,790
Exactly.
Me Neither.

746
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,240
I don't know what it's like,
but I do know that there's been people 

747
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,330
that have killed people when they were 
on Xanax.

748
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,630
And you know that guy in Vegas,
this shooter in Vegas,

749
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,660
that guy was on anti anxiety medication.
I didn't know that Chris Cornell was on 

750
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,970
anti anxiety medication when he killed 
themselves.

751
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:12,870
Look,
it's got a profound effect on some 

752
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,110
individuals and it's not uniform the way
it affects you.

753
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:16,180
It might affect change with different.
Totally different.

754
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,630
It's a different.
I mean I know,

755
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,990
I know tons of people who are on it.
Yeah,

756
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,630
I do.
And they respond.

757
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,050
Like you said,
they respond to it differently.

758
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:28,051
Yeah.
And I know tons of people on it will 

759
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:28,400
also drink while they're on it,
which you're not supposed to.

760
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,190
Yeah.
And that,

761
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,500
that's not good either.
Yeah.

762
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,110
It's screening with the screening 
component.

763
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:40,111
Right?
You got to be careful because what it 

764
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:40,111
then does,
it's like,

765
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:43,130
it becomes a de facto way of preventing 
people to own firearms arbitrarily.

766
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,300
Right.
So I was like,

767
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,340
oh,
well you have anxiety or even even 

768
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,400
somebody who's maybe dealing with PTSD,
not everybody's dealing with PTSD is as 

769
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,471
a potential murderous,
ravenous 100 percent person who just 

770
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:55,471
want to go out and kill people.

771
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:57,350
Um,
so with the screening component,

772
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,850
that's why I say yes or no.
Right.

773
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:04,150
If you can find a way,
if you can find a way to establish a 

774
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:04,910
screw,
a mental screening bit,

775
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,650
even then no,
because there's,

776
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,730
there's a,
there's a due process aspect to it as 

777
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:11,730
well.
Right?

778
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,770
So you can prevent me from owning and 
you can't prevent me from exercising a 

779
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:19,521
right if I haven't done something to 
absolve myself from being able to do 

780
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:19,521
that legally.
Right.

781
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:23,950
Okay.
So what if they come to your house and 

782
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,411
you've got,
let's say you've got like a cork board 

783
00:33:26,411 --> 00:33:31,391
up and you've got all these pictures of 
schools and fucking arrows pointing to 

784
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:34,670
the emergency exits and plans of how to 
block things off.

785
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:39,671
And then pictures of Jodie foster and 
pictures of serial killers up 

786
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:44,411
everywhere.
And you're on anti anxiety medications 

787
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:44,411
in the cops.

788
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:44,930
Talked to you and your fucking squirrely
as hell.

789
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,160
You haven't done anything?
No.

790
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,370
Arrest me.
Then if you can arrest me,

791
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:51,250
arrest can't.
If you can't arrest me for,

792
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,200
for a crime or possibly attempting to 
because like,

793
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,220
like you know,
like the legal standard is like taking 

794
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,300
substantial act to commit a crime even 
though you don't do it.

795
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:04,301
That's attempted.
Did you hear about the kid that got 

796
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:04,301
kicked out of school?
Um,

797
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:05,600
what was the school?
Who was an Asian kid?

798
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:08,570
Died his hair blonde,
started collecting bullets,

799
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,770
got a semi automatic rifle.
His friend started freaking out,

800
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:14,880
they called the cops,
cops came to visit him,

801
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:18,190
he bought another rifle and I believe 
they deported them.

802
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,570
They deported him for reasons not having
to do with the firearms.

803
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:25,260
They deported him for reasons that he 
wasn't actually going to anymore is on a

804
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:26,240
green card or visa,
I believe.

805
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,270
But the way the sheriffs were framing it
was they deported because they wanted 

806
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,751
this fucking psycho out of the country 
and they think that they might've 

807
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:34,751
prevented a crime.
They probably did,

808
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:39,580
but they still had.
They still had to establish a legal 

809
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,150
basis for deporting did all they had.
Was that,

810
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:42,290
that he didn't go to class.
I mean,

811
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:44,060
that's something you've done.
I've done.

812
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:44,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

813
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:46,220
I mean everybody is.
But then again,

814
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:47,540
he wasn't a citizen.
Right.

815
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,140
So,
and that was,

816
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:53,170
that was,
that was a requirement for him to 

817
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:53,170
continue to be here.
But it was really,

818
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:53,570
it was Kinda like Kinda got like Al 
Capone,

819
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:58,571
you know,
they got a component by tax evasion by 

820
00:34:58,571 --> 00:34:58,571
way of,
you know.

821
00:34:58,571 --> 00:34:58,571
Right,
right,

822
00:34:58,571 --> 00:35:02,201
right.
But he really had guns and was acting 

823
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:05,681
crazy and that's why the kids that were 
friends with them called and that's why 

824
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:07,970
they acted and they just found that 
loophole.

825
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,300
Yeah.
So what do you do with someone like 

826
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,300
that?
Other than that,

827
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,490
I mean this guy,
we had something.

828
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,170
What if this kid was still going to 
school?

829
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,930
I mean it be,
it'd be pretty bad,

830
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,310
pretty bad.
But,

831
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,690
but then again,
we still,

832
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,150
we still have our laws for a reason,
right?

833
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,180
We have,
we have our inherent rights for a 

834
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,180
reason.
Have to due process for a reason.

835
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:32,060
Because if we didn't have those right,
anyone could just come up and say,

836
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:34,310
man,
you know what I saw I saw calling you on

837
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:38,040
the war on instagram the other day.
He a picture of a god and he

838
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,040
was like cursing people out because 
they're making fun of him in the water 

839
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,270
he was drinking and so you know what?
Somebody needs to go check on them and 

840
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,200
make sure he's okay and somebody is 
going to take his guns away from him.

841
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,140
You've got to.
There's got to be through process.

842
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:51,300
I appreciate that.
And I agree with you and,

843
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:56,310
and it's,
it's unfortunate in that some people may

844
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:58,580
slip through the cracks,
but,

845
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,040
but I can arrest someone for something 
that they haven't done yet.

846
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,900
You just,
you just can't.

847
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,180
Well I agree.
And so that's where we are right now.

848
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:11,181
So then,
so then that now we're getting to the 

849
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:11,181
complexities the hardest of the hard 
questions,

850
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:11,490
right?
What do we do?

851
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:16,491
How do we put something in place to 
catch the people who do happen to fall 

852
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:16,530
between the cracks?
Right.

853
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,060
So then you go,
okay,

854
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,330
well try to keep up.
Sorry,

855
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,360
I'm moving.
I don't know if you saw a hydro.

856
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,880
The complexities.
Yeah,

857
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,470
it's,
it's a very complex issue,

858
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:33,710
which is why we're not largely not 
having it and we're having it here 

859
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,291
because no one wants to have this 
conversation on the national scene 

860
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:37,980
because it's hard and it doesn't make 
for great sound bite and it doesn't make

861
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,370
for good TV.
Right?

862
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:45,590
Because if I hate doing cable news hits 
because I have two minutes to basically 

863
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,590
reduce a complex issue that we've been 
debating for decades,

864
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:54,591
almost centuries.
It's the worst and it's also people 

865
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:55,380
talking over each other and there's one 
or two boxes,

866
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,660
one guy here,
one guy there.

867
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,620
Usually you're not even in the same room
to go there.

868
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,110
You're talking to those earpieces.
There is a delay.

869
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,530
Those things are a disaster or horrible.
One of the worst ways to communicate,

870
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:07,570
which is why I try to establish my 
platform or my show war.

871
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,830
I try to have it as a platform that's 
open to people to come on,

872
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:16,130
hey look,
you want to come on and discuss this 

873
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:16,130
issue?
By all means come to it.

874
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,400
Have you had anyone that's the really 
strict anti-gun on.

875
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,150
Yeah.
I had A.

876
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:23,400
I had an entire season,
so what we did in the season,

877
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,430
I think it was two seasons ago,
we brought on a young lady and a guy 

878
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:31,530
from New Zealand,
I can't remember,

879
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,890
but he came on the show.
They were anti and so what we did was he

880
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:39,891
had a round table discussion at the end 
of every episode of my show and we will 

881
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:43,281
bring up a specific topic and we discuss
it and so they basically was like two 

882
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:46,180
against one essentially until they would
talk to me about what their thoughts on,

883
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,240
on what we talked about in the show or a
particular gun control issue and we had 

884
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,180
that conversation had an individual.

885
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,220
I sit down with her as well when we 
talked about it and then took her to the

886
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:57,610
shooting range to shoot for the first 
time,

887
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,810
you know,
but that's going to be overlooked.

888
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,400
Right.
They know they ignore it.

889
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,860
Well they probably aren't even aware of 
it because I wasn't aware of it.

890
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,800
Another,
wherever you think people who need to be

891
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:10,020
aware of it,
aware of it because like for instance,

892
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,100
I bring this point up and it makes me 
come across as if like I feel some type 

893
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:17,850
of way cause he didn't mention me,
but it's not really that.

894
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,750
It just speaks volumes to what I've been
pointing at for the longest.

895
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:26,751
They ignore rational discourse.
John Oliver did a 20 minute monologue on

896
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,700
Nra tv about NITV,
right?

897
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,030
Twenty minutes.
You know how long?

898
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,960
Twenty minutes long.
I guess that's a long time.

899
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,890
He didn't me once.

900
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,610
He didn't mention my shot.
I have three shows on NITV,

901
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,900
three shows and I had the second 
longest,

902
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,960
longest running show on nitv.
He didn't mention me once.

903
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,060
The level of detail that they went into 
within that monologue lets me know.

904
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,250
They watched everything on that 
platform.

905
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,870
They watched it all.
Why do you think you left?

906
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,160
Because they didn't fit the narrative.
Right?

907
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:02,430
Also because he is a progressive guy 
with glasses who's white and you really 

908
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:07,600
shouldn't you really sit and say 
anything negative about black people?

909
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,160
How so?
He's but he's not white though.

910
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:10,330
He's a minority.
Just like me.

911
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,170
What is he?
He's.

912
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,160
I don't know.
He's like,

913
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,060
I don't want Oliver.
He's white.

914
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,230
It's not white.
What is he doing?

915
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,580
If he's not white?
I'm not white.

916
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,390
What the fuck is he?
Irish,

917
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,220
Irish.
My white.

918
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,870
If I'm not,
what the fuck is.

919
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,460
If I saw you on the street,
you are in the olden days.

920
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:35,461
I wasn't.
My grandparents weren't white when my 

921
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:35,461
grandparents came over.
That guy's white over white.

922
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:36,280
He's white.
White Paper,

923
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,190
isn't it?
Yeah.

924
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,980
Oh Shit.
I'm wrong.

925
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,120
Well,
there you go.

926
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,130
What did you think he was?
I don't know.

927
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,220
I never thought about him confused with 
the daily show guy.

928
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,940
I probably am Trevor Noah.
You know,

929
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,800
not trevor.
I know,

930
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:50,700
but I know about trevor.
Yeah,

931
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,170
he's white as fuck.
There's a white Englishman.

932
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,010
Minimum Racist.

933
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,250
But for a guy like that,
guys like that have dave.

934
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,760
Here's the thing about progressives and 
I like John Oliver.

935
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,300
I'm not.
I'm not negative against John.

936
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,640
I'm going to start doing a show.
I have.

937
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,130
I had this perspective up until this 
point.

938
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,400
So I'm going to shut off.
I'm going to shut off my belief system 

939
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,220
and listen to you and listen to what 
you're about to say because I haven't 

940
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,070
thought about this because I thought he 
wasn't white to this entire time.

941
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,400
So.
So yeah.

942
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:21,030
So now he's white as fuck,
right?

943
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,470
I mean,
it might not even above what.

944
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,400
Bye.
He did it.

945
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:29,401
He might've found the worst examples and
maybe you were too reasonable and it 

946
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:29,890
doesn't fit the narrative of being 
funny.

947
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,100
I mean his show,
although his show has points and he 

948
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,551
makes these very clear conclusions and 
you know,

949
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,600
but it's funny.
It's a funny show.

950
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:45,650
That's the whole thing behind it is like
any girl who's dating me knows like I 

951
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,390
have enough episodes on,
on,

952
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,680
on,
on that platform.

953
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,230
You could find some stuff to make fun of
me about Paul.

954
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:55,250
I'm sure they could,
but I don't think that's the kind of 

955
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,631
thing they're trying to make fun of,
like individual personalities that say 

956
00:40:57,631 --> 00:41:00,931
stupid shit.
I think what they're trying to do is 

957
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:03,451
point out the disingenuous narrative 
from the NRA while ignoring the 

958
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:08,050
disingenuous narrative from the anti gun
advocates.

959
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,790
Okay.

960
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,310
I could possibly see that.
I'm trying to.

961
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:18,010
I'm trying to be fair and reasonable 
because my mind wants to go,

962
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:19,400
Nah,
he saw he.

963
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,690
He realized that by mentioning me.
Right.

964
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,910
It's going to.
It's going to peak curiosity with the 

965
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,861
audience in which he's trying to.
So you think your two reasonable into 

966
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,090
logical in that since you're not like 
this redneck,

967
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:34,100
he haw type character that like talk 
about you.

968
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,880
It doesn't fit their narrative salicious
ignore him because that's a trade on the

969
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:38,810
dummies.
Think about it,

970
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,700
but everybody was still real though,
right?

971
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,460
Don't have domains on all sides.
That's true.

972
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,550
That's true.
But it's pretty easy to find like pro 

973
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,820
gun dummies.
You can find quite a few of them.

974
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:53,480
I can pretty easy to find dummies on the
other side as well for sure.

975
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,120
But you wouldn't be looking if you were 
on that side,

976
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:56,660
right?

977
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:00,470
If you're on the anti gun side,
you're looking for program dummies.

978
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,790
Pro Gun dummies.
Yeah.

979
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,280
Pro Gun dummies are easy to find.
They are right.

980
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:08,480
There's plenty of them right now.
You can go fucking find him on instagram

981
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:13,481
and twitter and there's,
there's dummies all over the world and 

982
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:13,481
say,
here's the thing though,

983
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:16,430
the thing about what John Oliver does,
and that's the thing.

984
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,420
This is the kind of disingenuous nature 
of satire and political satire.

985
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,680
It,
I call it the,

986
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,750
the,
uh,

987
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,890
the comedian plausible deniability card.
Right.

988
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,100
Okay.
So you can make a joke about something 

989
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,100
and then say,
oh,

990
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,470
it has no influence because it's just a 
joke.

991
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,080
It's not.
But he's not saying that as he.

992
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,700
He's not saying it doesn't have any 
influence.

993
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,220
What exactly he understands the 
influence at wields,

994
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,300
but he's.
But he's saying,

995
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:43,330
but he can.
He can always swipe the plausible 

996
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:43,330
deniability card and say,
well no,

997
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,541
I wasn't making an actual political 
statement like I know that there 

998
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:46,541
reasonable people on the other side.

999
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:47,810
No,
you're pushing a narrative that has been

1000
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:51,800
pushed for decades about an organization
that fights for the second amendment,

1001
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,480
the same,
the same,

1002
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,540
the same narrative that's being pushed 
by groups of people who say the only 

1003
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,340
thing standing in their way of more gun 
control is the NRA.

1004
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,640
So what do you do?
So where does it to make it as power 

1005
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:06,640
from?
Because they,

1006
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,010
they,
they talk out of both sides of their 

1007
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:10,010
mouth.
They don't get the power from there.

1008
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,810
I'm sorry.
They don't get power by their 

1009
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:13,810
membership.
Right?

1010
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:14,930
Right.
So what do you do?

1011
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,090
You do your best to stifle that 
membership.

1012
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:20,300
You make it seem as unattractive as 
possible and then you also,

1013
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,660
your audience has already largely 
uneducated on the issue.

1014
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,390
Right,
and he was already this perceived notion

1015
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:29,150
at the Nras,
just a bunch of racist white rednecks.

1016
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,440
Right?
So then what?

1017
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,240
Then what do you do to further that 
narrative?

1018
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:37,570
You talk about their platform and then 
you pull out all of those things that 

1019
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,951
further drive that narrative while 
ignoring the most popular figure on the 

1020
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:41,951
platform,
which is,

1021
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,630
which is me,
and so who so happens to be black.

1022
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,950
So what does that say?
It tells me that this,

1023
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:53,050
that it was deliberate.
I really do want to agree with you and 

1024
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:53,050
say,
you know what?

1025
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,910
He's white.
He didn't want to be seen as attacking 

1026
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,910
the black guy.
So forth and so on.

1027
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,820
I think there's a little of that,
but I think there's also.

1028
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:00,830
He's doing a show and let.
Let me,

1029
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:04,220
let me explain how the show works.
He's got a team of writers.

1030
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,340
There's a ton of people back there.
They are just trying to be funny.

1031
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,490
They're trying to make points for sure,
but they're trying to find stupid shit 

1032
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:15,791
that they can mock and why would they 
concentrate on the guy that makes sense 

1033
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:16,040
if they're looking for stupid shit that 
they come up,

1034
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:21,041
they're not trying to make a balanced 
reasonable argument like maybe we would 

1035
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:21,041
do right here.

1036
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:21,620
Right now.
What they're doing is doing a condensed,

1037
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,050
edited down,
very smooth,

1038
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:29,230
polished television show with that rent 
has been dissected and gone over by a 

1039
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,310
team of writers and they have video that
corresponds it and photographs that they

1040
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:35,210
shoot go to and they have clips that 
they show them.

1041
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,220
They mock the clips.
It's a comedy show.

1042
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,620
They do have a point,
but it's a comedy show.

1043
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,650
Absolutely agree with.
That's why they didn't go after you is 

1044
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,530
because maybe you're a lawyer.
Maybe you're articulate.

1045
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,160
Maybe you is because you're young and 
black and they just don't feel like it's

1046
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:53,430
a smart thing to do,
but it's because they're making a show.

1047
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,240
I agree with you.
Now.

1048
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:59,241
Let me tell you why my panties on a 
ruffle about it just because I 

1049
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:00,510
understand the influence of that show.
When people make political decisions,

1050
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,640
but don't you think it's preaching to 
the choir that show?

1051
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,510
What do you mean?
That one,

1052
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:04,200
that show?
Yeah,

1053
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:09,201
John Oliver show.
I think if I had to guess how many 

1054
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:10,260
people who are watching the show are 
left wing leaning,

1055
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,380
democratic leaning,
liberal leaning.

1056
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,960
I would say it's a giant percentage.
Here's the problem though.

1057
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,800
The number of people who come to me and 
say,

1058
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:25,070
I don't.
I don't deal with the NRA because 

1059
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,100
they're racist and there are a bunch of 
white rednecks who says that?

1060
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,390
Oh God,
I get it all the time.

1061
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,680
The evidence that they point to,
they just assume that they're racist.

1062
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,790
They,
that's,

1063
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,760
that's just it.
Because in their,

1064
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,440
in their attempts to just make a show.
Right,

1065
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,230
and I agree with you wholeheartedly.
I absolutely agree with you,

1066
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,620
but we can't undermine how influential 
that show is at crafting people's 

1067
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,570
thoughts about particular issues and 
ideologies within this country.

1068
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,300
Right?
And so I stand back and I'm like,

1069
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:56,301
man,
this is dangerous because to meet the 

1070
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:56,301
second amendment is incredibly 
important.

1071
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:57,120
Right.
I don't know what the funny thing is.

1072
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:00,150
I thought the monologue was hilarious.
Funny Dude.

1073
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,680
Mama monologue is hilarious.
I'll give.

1074
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,040
I'll give him the model I'm arguing 
with.

1075
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,800
My log was funny then.
Isn't even funny dude,

1076
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:12,801
because he said that funny.
He was a funny dude during that 20 

1077
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:15,351
minute mile.
Sometimes he's not to demonstrate you 

1078
00:46:15,351 --> 00:46:15,351
got.
No.

1079
00:46:15,351 --> 00:46:16,610
You got to demonstrate consistency.
Consistency.

1080
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:21,670
You give me some consistency.
I'll let you drop the ball a couple 

1081
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:21,670
times here and there.
That's fine.

1082
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,910
But as far as consistency,
it's tough job.

1083
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,750
Know John Oliver Guy.
He's got a tough job.

1084
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:26,430
I think it's.
I think it's incredibly tough.

1085
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:31,431
I think.
I think comedians don't get enough 

1086
00:46:31,431 --> 00:46:31,431
credit.
I make sure it's even a real comedian.

1087
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,560
Stand up.
This John Oliver,

1088
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:35,110
is that.
Is that.

1089
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,720
Is that the barometer for being a 
comedian?

1090
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:39,660
Stand up for us.
It's a big.

1091
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,700
There's a big difference.
I stand up to me,

1092
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:46,701
terrifies me,
but the thought of ever having to keep 

1093
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:49,071
them on.
I'll get in front of a million people 

1094
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:49,071
and talk all day long,
but the thought of Standup,

1095
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,540
see I get to quote some of my humor and 
seriousness.

1096
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,010
Right?
So it's easier,

1097
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,440
right?
I can do stuff here and there,

1098
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:54,720
like,
oh,

1099
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:55,440
he's kind of funny.
Well,

1100
00:46:55,441 --> 00:47:00,441
no,
it's only because it's contrasting 

1101
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:00,441
against something that's serious and you
don't expect to humor.

1102
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:03,830
Do you remember the way you felt before 
you walked into that shooting range and 

1103
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:03,830
those guns were going off and you're 
like,

1104
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,360
holy shit,
it's really happening now.

1105
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,150
Think about how you feel now when you 
walk into the range.

1106
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:10,990
Like I go to the range.
Yeah.

1107
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,450
I go to the range all the time.
You know,

1108
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,480
especially when I was rifle hunting,
I would go to the range least once a 

1109
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:17,480
month.

1110
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:17,880
Yeah.
And you know,

1111
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,960
got used to it.
You Go,

1112
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:19,770
you hear the bang,
Bang,

1113
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:21,380
Bang,
put your headphones on.

1114
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,720
He just walk up and say hi to everybody 
that you see there all the time.

1115
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,230
Everybody's super polite at the range.
That's one thing,

1116
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:33,231
man.
People polite as fuck at the range 

1117
00:47:33,231 --> 00:47:35,440
because everybody around you has the 
ability to kill you.

1118
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,890
They're just not everybody around you.
Especially when.

1119
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,550
I mean I was in the rifle section,
I've got a 300 win mag.

1120
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,380
I'll blow a fucking door outdoors,
outdoors,

1121
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,440
outdoors,
Jesus.

1122
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,280
That's the God damn cannon,
you know,

1123
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:51,460
and everybody around you got one of 
these things to.

1124
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,530
Everybody can kill everybody and 
everybody's like,

1125
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:54,370
hey man,
how you doing?

1126
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,510
What's up?
How's everybody doing?

1127
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,790
Everybody super friendly but shaking 
hands.

1128
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,800
There's a mutual respect there,
but it's interesting.

1129
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,860
That's an interesting.
I mean that's a weird statement that 

1130
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,161
gets thrown about a lot of times that,
oh well armed society is a polite 

1131
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:08,161
society.

1132
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:12,350
Let me.
There were two times in my life where I 

1133
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,360
felt vehemently insecure the first time 
I carried a gun out of my house and my 

1134
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:17,940
first mma class.
Oh yeah,

1135
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:23,010
that makes sense.
But what I was going to say is when you 

1136
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:26,230
go to the gun range a bunch of times,
then it becomes normal comes life.

1137
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,120
That's what standup is.
Gotcha.

1138
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,850
Same thing.
I mean you still can eat plates,

1139
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:34,420
a Dick's on stage on occasion to go 
south and it's terrible.

1140
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:39,160
It's the worst feeling good about Texas.
Fucking dead on and hilarious.

1141
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:39,970
Oh,
were you there?

1142
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,470
No,
I just thought which,

1143
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,770
which bit?
Which bit where you were basically about

1144
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:48,810
bikinis or all the Lions and tigers,
people that keep the Tigers.

1145
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:54,600
That shit's true.
Basically talking about we need these 

1146
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,301
people without fighting wars and people 
who have Santa Monica.

1147
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,540
That is true,
man,

1148
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,190
that people who've never been to Texas 
do not understand.

1149
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,510
That is the America of American don't 
play.

1150
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,280
No,
we.

1151
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,330
Texas doesn't play.
We are the most arrogant some bitches on

1152
00:49:08,331 --> 00:49:10,180
the planet.
It's also like what?

1153
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:15,210
When people think of America overseas,
they think of like these fucking crazy 

1154
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:18,820
people with guns that have jacked up 
trucks that are driving too fast.

1155
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,460
The girls have big tits.
The guy's a fucking crazy.

1156
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,970
That's what we think of.
That's Texas like this,

1157
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:29,971
not American now as a whole.
It's Texas is the most exaggerated form 

1158
00:49:29,971 --> 00:49:34,081
of it.
Texas houses the most exaggerated form 

1159
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:34,081
of that.
Yes.

1160
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:34,930
There's a lot of cool people in Texas.
Texas is way more diverse.

1161
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:39,931
People in Austin,
which is like super left on the Austin 

1162
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:42,070
is like California and Texas a little 
bit,

1163
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,620
but I think it's a little cooler.
It's smaller,

1164
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,920
but it's the.
The thing I said about about Texas 

1165
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,851
that's true is there's more tigers in 
captivity in Texas than there are in all

1166
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:55,720
of the wild of the world.

1167
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,220
More Tigers in private collections.
That's fucking true,

1168
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,480
and when I read that,
I was like,

1169
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:06,510
oh my God,
I have to figure out a way to make this 

1170
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,401
funny,
craziest fucking statistic I've ever 

1171
00:50:08,401 --> 00:50:09,740
heard in my life,
in people's yards.

1172
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:10,750
Not gonna lie to you.
I grew up.

1173
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:15,930
I grew up my entire life in Texas 
wanting to Cheetah Cheetah and they're 

1174
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:19,990
beautiful man.
Beautiful,

1175
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:21,460
beautiful man.
And just watching.

1176
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:24,100
The funny thing is I get a cheetah and 
put it in and put it in the yard.

1177
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:26,500
No bigger than this room and inspect to 
see the beauty of it running.

1178
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:27,820
Well,
you know,

1179
00:50:27,821 --> 00:50:32,821
it's also fucked up.
I don't think you're allowed to like 

1180
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:33,410
just feed them animals.
I don't think you're allowed to just let

1181
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:38,411
loose a goat and have a.
have the Cheetah tackle the goat and 

1182
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:38,990
fuck it up.
I think you have to feed them meat.

1183
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,400
You know,
like,

1184
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,600
like already curing process.
You're allowed to have some wild kingdom

1185
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:46,280
shit.
Go down in your yard.

1186
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:47,780
I don't think they allow them.
Oh No,

1187
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:49,460
you did say we only have three pages of 
law.

1188
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:53,810
So if it's not to say,
you know what I'm saying?

1189
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,720
Shit about tigers ordered enough new,
order it up.

1190
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:02,150
You know,
the funny thing about it is when I got 

1191
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,731
into firearms,
I lived in Texas my whole life and I 

1192
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:04,490
went 23 years without ever shooting gun,
touching the gun.

1193
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:08,090
And when I got into it,
I started the first thing I wanted to do

1194
00:51:08,091 --> 00:51:09,460
with shoe competition.
Right?

1195
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,070
And so you should competition do this 
competition.

1196
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,890
It's like John Wick style where you go 
to bang,

1197
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,690
Bang,
Bang,

1198
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,440
Bang,
Bang,

1199
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,290
Bang.
Three gun,

1200
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,580
they call it three guns,
three guns.

1201
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,680
So basically three gun consists of three
different,

1202
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,280
three different platforms or rifle,
shotgun and a handgun.

1203
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:31,630
So how does this competition work?
So basically they just set up basic set 

1204
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,560
up various courses where you have to 
utilize one of those three platforms.

1205
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:35,180
Some of the courses you utilize all 
three.

1206
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,400
And so it's just,
it's just in there,

1207
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:42,401
you're set to a timer.
You got to clear the courses as fast as 

1208
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:42,401
possible.
Uh,

1209
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:43,970
yeah.
In the clearing the choruses are you,

1210
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,720
is there like walls that you have to 
look behind you?

1211
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:52,820
You're only limited by your imagination.
Do you ever see that shit with Keanu 

1212
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,410
reeves was preparing for John Wick Two?
Yeah.

1213
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:54,490
Oh,
you were there.

1214
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,010
I wasn't.
Okay.

1215
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,340
So I was there not for that particular 
video that went viral,

1216
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:03,580
but I was there one day when he was 
training and so I met him after the 

1217
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,870
fact.
How is he different?

1218
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,640
Is He,
he's,

1219
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:14,920
um,
a spacey.

1220
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,410
Spacey.
Yeah.

1221
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,290
Interesting.
But not in a bad way.

1222
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,450
It's a very,
very calm energy.

1223
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,740
Um,
you know,

1224
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:26,741
why,
why that's how he handles being that 

1225
00:52:26,741 --> 00:52:26,741
famous.
Gotcha.

1226
00:52:26,741 --> 00:52:28,220
And I just shut up.
I picked up on it immediately.

1227
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,620
Then it wasn't,
it wasn't bad.

1228
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,730
It was,
it wasn't a bad thing.

1229
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,520
It's a good thing.
You got to realize he's the matrix guy.

1230
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:39,910
That's some over the top fame.
He hit that Johnny Depp or Tom Cruise 

1231
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:43,580
level of fame and then just became this 
super chill,

1232
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:47,960
mellow guy that can just like go through
crowds that kind of goes and sits on the

1233
00:52:47,961 --> 00:52:50,000
subway by himself.
No,

1234
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,230
like freaking awesome.
Yeah.

1235
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:56,231
But there's no obvious outward displays 
of wealth from him and he's insanely 

1236
00:52:56,231 --> 00:52:57,410
wealthy.
When you see him.

1237
00:52:57,411 --> 00:53:02,411
He's dressed like me.
He's got like a regular watch on and 

1238
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:02,450
sneakers.
He's normal as fuck man.

1239
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,470
It's,
it's real weird.

1240
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:08,710
Like he's,
he's figured out a way to avoid like 

1241
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,130
there is right there on the fucking 
subway,

1242
00:53:10,131 --> 00:53:11,560
just chilling,
you know,

1243
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:15,200
and he looks like a totally normal dude.
Yeah.

1244
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,640
Well,
and people freak out.

1245
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:17,960
They're like,
is that no,

1246
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:23,010
I can't be like,
people ignore him because he's figured 

1247
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,200
out a way to just sort of just layer in 
plain sight.

1248
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,850
And then even if you talk to him,
he's just normal.

1249
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,470
Like everybody that I know that's met 
him.

1250
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:29,820
I said the dudes like totally look at 
it.

1251
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,690
He lets his chicks it down,
you know?

1252
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,540
He said,
do you want to sit down?

1253
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,230
Go ahead.
Boom.

1254
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,710
And he just stands up.
Look at it,

1255
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,750
I mean even the ways he's not,
no body guards,

1256
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:42,050
you know,
what's interesting about his demeanor 

1257
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,700
and how he doesn't have this sense of 
entitlement and I'm bringing it back,

1258
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,950
bringing it back to the gun thing a 
little bit.

1259
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,680
The first time I carried a gun.
Um,

1260
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:51,170
remember I told you those are the two 
most,

1261
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,280
the times where I felt more insecure was
my first day in mma and carrying a gun 

1262
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,750
for the first time.
But carrying that gun for the first time

1263
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:59,730
made me realize,
Oh shit,

1264
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,070
I'm not the only one.
Right?

1265
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:07,490
So it actually humbled me and from the 
standpoint that knowing that you don't 

1266
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,140
know who you're dealing with and when 
you carry a firearm on you,

1267
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:13,530
you have the ability to go from zero to 
100 like that.

1268
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,670
And so you develop a respect for that.
Also,

1269
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:22,671
you start to develop a respect for life 
as well because you understand how 

1270
00:54:22,671 --> 00:54:22,671
fragile you start to realize how fragile
it is.

1271
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,280
And so for me,
I actually became more docile.

1272
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,640
Like I don't get road rage because I 
understand and because I live in Texas,

1273
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,740
we don't do that.
No,

1274
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,800
it's not.
But I also know that like there's so 

1275
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,160
much responsibility that comes with 
carrying a firearm.

1276
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,300
It's an unreal.
Um,

1277
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:48,430
and so for people who go out of the 
means to learn to do it and be able to 

1278
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,501
do it,
like there's a certain level of respect 

1279
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:51,870
you have to have for it because it comes
with a lot.

1280
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:56,871
There's certain places you can't go.
Certain things you can't do things you 

1281
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:56,871
have to be cognizant of.
Like,

1282
00:54:56,871 --> 00:55:01,460
so I started,
I actually started staying away from 

1283
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,771
certain places because I knew I had a 
gun on me and I never wanted to have to 

1284
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:03,771
be put in a situation,
actually have to go for it.

1285
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:07,170
Did you wear a gun all the time?
What if I can do it legally?

1286
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:07,530
I have

1287
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:08,440
really?
Yeah.

1288
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:13,630
And what is the idea behind that?
Is that like it's better to have it not 

1289
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:14,250
to need it than to need it not to have 
it?

1290
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:14,250
Yeah.

1291
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,580
Yeah,
it's,

1292
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,560
it's an,
it's no different.

1293
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:18,510
It's literally just a part of my 
routine.

1294
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,340
Watch,
watch keys,

1295
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:21,030
phones,
wallet,

1296
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:26,031
Gun,
one of the chamber or no one in the 

1297
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:26,031
chamber.
Oh and yeah,

1298
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,900
safety on chambered the gun.
I usually carry doesn't,

1299
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:30,740
they don't have external safeties.
It's just I,

1300
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,660
I carry in the holster.
So if you carry the holster it shouldn't

1301
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:35,130
be an issue.
Wow.

1302
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,750
Yeah.
That's interesting.

1303
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,790
So you just want to be really,
really ready.

1304
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:43,870
Yeah.
Well see he don't want to have to know 

1305
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:43,870
and see.
Here's the thing.

1306
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:43,870
That's that.
That's progressive.

1307
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,560
I wasn't always like that.
I started off not caring with one in the

1308
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:51,561
chamber.
Why wouldn't you just start putting one 

1309
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:53,991
in the chamber?
When I started understanding and 

1310
00:55:53,991 --> 00:55:55,581
trusting the mechanics of a firearm,
because when I started caring I knew 

1311
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:56,490
about guns.
I didn't trust the mechanics.

1312
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,170
Right,
right.

1313
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,740
So you,
that extra step,

1314
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,520
you don't feel like it's necessary of 
like.

1315
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,180
No.
What do you mean?

1316
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:05,610
In terms of like having A.
Well,

1317
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:07,320
I understand that.
I understand.

1318
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,420
So I started doing training,
right?

1319
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,690
And started training with the guns in 
self defense and stuff like that.

1320
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,970
And I started realizing,
you know,

1321
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,430
so the gun isn't,
isn't an end all,

1322
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:22,431
be all right.
It's just a tool that I carry with me 

1323
00:56:22,431 --> 00:56:24,010
that could possibly save my life.
I still dog with a gun

1324
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,910
on me for sure.
All right.

1325
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:30,430
Um,
but I'd started weighing the 

1326
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:30,940
disadvantages and the advantages of 
having one in the chamber.

1327
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:36,150
Right.
I might find myself in a situation 

1328
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,150
where,
you know,

1329
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,150
what I have time to,
okay,

1330
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:39,790
I'm behind here and I have time to rack 
it and do what I need to do.

1331
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:45,330
There may be other times where I won't,
but if I already have a round in the 

1332
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,901
chamber,
those times where I will have the time 

1333
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:51,240
and not have the time won't make a 
difference because there's already one 

1334
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:51,630
of the chamber ready to go.
Yeah.

1335
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,310
So from that perspective,
um,

1336
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,470
as I got more comfortable with the gun 
and realize,

1337
00:56:56,471 --> 00:57:01,471
holy crap,
the gun never just went off on its own 

1338
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:01,471
because it was an inherent fear there.
Right.

1339
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:02,100
It's like,
you don't want the gun to go off while I

1340
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:02,830
was in your pants.

1341
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,900
You have like one of them Chi decks 
holsters.

1342
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:06,490
It's form fitted gun.
Yeah.

1343
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,680
I have tons of holes.
I have a box for the holster show you 

1344
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:11,680
because I reviewed guns and review and 
gear and stuff,

1345
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,471
so I'm constantly switching,
which is a gift and a curse because you 

1346
00:57:16,471 --> 00:57:19,731
know I never perfect any platform,
but I can you put any pretty much any 

1347
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:22,240
gun in my hand I can use decently now 
when things happen,

1348
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:24,790
whenever there's a mass shooting or 
something,

1349
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,920
immediately people want to blame gun 
owners or people that want to protect 

1350
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:34,090
gun owners and specifically NRA members.
This comes down on you.

1351
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:39,091
Sometimes it's always a problem.
It comes down to people that want guns 

1352
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:46,770
and the people that don't want 
regulations and don't want additional 

1353
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:46,770
screening.
We.

1354
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:47,740
Yeah,
because you've got to think about it.

1355
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:51,130
So like the figureheads when you,
when you started talking about Wayne and

1356
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,200
there people go after them clearly,
but then also you have the personalities

1357
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,640
of the brand,
which is me,

1358
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:00,740
Dana and Dana.

1359
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:01,900
Dana,
Dana last,

1360
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:03,790
right.
She's an official spokesperson.

1361
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,780
Right.
It's a very nice lady.

1362
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:05,660
I met her.
Exactly.

1363
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:07,210
And then you have mentorship,
Cam Edwards,

1364
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:08,560
it shows.
Well,

1365
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:13,561
exactly,
and so what tends to happen is I get it 

1366
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:15,010
a lot via social because that's how I 
built my brand.

1367
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,800
I built my brand through social and so 
most people will when they can't 

1368
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,561
descend,
like I don't think Wayne Lapierre has a 

1369
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:25,561
twitter page,
you know what I mean?

1370
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:28,150
He doesn't have an instagram account so 
it was probably in a bunker somewhere.

1371
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:34,310
He's not counting ammo.
More noble than I believe you.

1372
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:40,940
Well you're.
What you are is an interesting version 

1373
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,850
of the NRA is like,
oh this is the NRA too.

1374
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,460
Like there's a kind of a new thing.
It's multifaceted.

1375
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:51,580
I dare anyone to go to the NRA annual 
meetings and then if you can,

1376
00:58:51,581 --> 00:58:52,950
I don't know how secluded is.

1377
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,240
Go to the board meeting.
You have a dinner meetings.

1378
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,480
You'll be surprised they'll have I every
race you can think of different 

1379
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:00,480
sexualities.
You name it.

1380
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,320
Oh,
I believe it was in the NRA forever.

1381
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:07,321
I just admired,
let my membership lapse like a year and 

1382
00:59:07,321 --> 00:59:09,100
a half ago,
but I was in the NRA because I just felt

1383
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:13,450
like I know people that are just like,
we've got to get rid of the guns.

1384
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:14,170
I'm like,
man,

1385
00:59:14,171 --> 00:59:19,171
I don't think that's going to do it and 
I don't think that's going to stop 

1386
00:59:19,171 --> 00:59:19,570
anything.
And I ask people this all the time.

1387
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:21,650
I've done it on my show.
I call it the big red button question,

1388
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:22,040
right?

1389
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,280
So he put a big red button.
I'd asked him if I put a big red button 

1390
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:27,280
in the middle of table,
if you push this button,

1391
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,490
all the guns on the planet disappear.
What'd you do it?

1392
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:32,310
And then I'll get various answers,
but I wouldn't do it.

1393
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,140
And people are like,
why?

1394
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,600
Like why would you not be the end of 
violence?

1395
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,810
Not really.
It's also the end of defense.

1396
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,900
Exactly.
Especially when you're talking about 

1397
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:43,900
military.
I mean if you can't,

1398
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,860
if you don't have guns,
like what are we going to fight with 

1399
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:47,860
swords and bows and arrows and shit.

1400
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,370
Do you know the interesting thing about 
that too is a lot of people are either 

1401
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:51,370
side will say they were like,
why?

1402
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:53,000
The same people will say,
well why do you need an Ar 15?

1403
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:58,510
And then in an inverse when I say the 
Second Amendment is actually not about 

1404
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:01,871
hunting,
it's about defending ourselves from a 

1405
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:01,871
tyrannical government,
domestic or foreign.

1406
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:01,871
They're like,
oh,

1407
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:03,560
you think you little stupid guns are 
going to be able to defend against the,

1408
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,480
against the government.
And I'm like,

1409
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,910
well then why don't you give me the guns
that the government has done?

1410
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:14,490
And then they get quiet because they 
realized the contradiction in what 

1411
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:14,490
they're stating.

1412
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,270
Well,
it's also the government.

1413
01:00:15,271 --> 01:00:17,930
When you say the government,
like protect us against the government,

1414
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:21,150
we are the government.
The government's filled with people like

1415
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:23,340
the cops are us.
The problem is,

1416
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:25,920
is this separation of us.
If you gave me a red button,

1417
01:00:25,921 --> 01:00:30,921
said would I,
could I end all senseless violence by 

1418
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:31,260
hitting that button?
I would say yes.

1419
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,940
And then when people say it's a gun's 
problem,

1420
01:00:32,941 --> 01:00:37,941
I said,
do you know that London Past New York 

1421
01:00:37,941 --> 01:00:38,460
City for the first time since 1800 in 
homicides,

1422
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:43,580
and they did it with fucking nice with 
knives to the point where that goofball 

1423
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:47,070
mayor of London,
that Dork on his twitter page said,

1424
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:52,071
there's no reason to carry a knife.
If you get caught carrying a knife,

1425
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:55,560
you will be prosecuted under the fullest
extent of the law.

1426
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,840
This is the fucking knife.
But I've got a knife.

1427
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,240
Oh I don't have it on me right now,
but I have a knife on me all the time.

1428
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:04,020
It's the same country that the utilizes 
the shining example of what we should be

1429
01:01:04,021 --> 01:01:05,400
doing in America.
Exactly.

1430
01:01:05,401 --> 01:01:08,040
And they have more murders in London 
from knives.

1431
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,660
And here's the funny thing about that 
too,

1432
01:01:09,661 --> 01:01:12,690
you know like in.
So they have an uptake and acid attacks.

1433
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,000
Sorry,
I think I'd rather be shot.

1434
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,150
Yeah,
that acid.

1435
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:22,300
Well that's a,
that's a thing that people are doing to 

1436
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:22,300
ex wives and shit too.
Yeah,

1437
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,910
that's ducks.
I mean is that is dark.

1438
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,350
That is some human shit.
But it's also will all of this stuff,

1439
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,680
it comes down to like what makes a fully
developed person instead of looking at 

1440
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:38,751
what's available to a fully developed 
person and what would allow fully 

1441
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:40,020
developed person to commit horrific 
crimes.

1442
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:45,290
What turns a person into that we should 
be looking at it from the root to the 

1443
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:50,870
fully grown.
Like what is the process that allow 

1444
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:54,041
someone to become a mass shooter?
What's the process that allow them to 

1445
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:54,041
throw acid in someone's face?

1446
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:54,580
Because I have,
you know,

1447
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:59,670
I clearly have to frame everything to my
perspective because I know what the 

1448
01:01:59,670 --> 01:01:59,670
best.
But like even for me,

1449
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:04,661
like I said it in video before,
if I ever had to pull my gun and shoot 

1450
01:02:04,661 --> 01:02:04,661
someone to take a life,
I'm going to.

1451
01:02:04,661 --> 01:02:05,910
I'm going to need therapy.
Yeah,

1452
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,470
I am.
Because because I value life that much.

1453
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:10,610
I value it.

1454
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,090
Great.
Do you have children?

1455
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:12,600
No,
I don't.

1456
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,100
Let me tell you something,
man.

1457
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,310
If he had kids and some guy was trying 
to hurt your daughter and he shot him,

1458
01:02:17,311 --> 01:02:19,800
I think he'd sleep like a baby.
But you know what?

1459
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:24,940
That's interesting you say that because 
when I talked to women about firearm 

1460
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:24,940
ownership,
right,

1461
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:29,330
like none of the girls know girls I've 
ever been in a relationship with were 

1462
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:29,330
like pro gun.
Right?

1463
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:29,940
But over time,
you know,

1464
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:35,060
dealing with me,
I mean when you walk into my house and 

1465
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:35,060
there's five rifles on the table,
you kind of just have to get acclimated.

1466
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:38,550
But in dealing with women who started 
off initially as anti,

1467
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
a lot of them talk about not wanting 
guns because they can't see themselves 

1468
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,481
taking the life.
But the moment I asked them would they 

1469
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:47,481
take a life to protect a child?

1470
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,050
Oh yeah,
I'm blowing that sucker away,

1471
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,030
you know?
And it's interesting how that works.

1472
01:02:51,031 --> 01:02:52,510
How we.
And I,

1473
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:57,730
I felt like I agree with you,
I'd be the same way to a child and you 

1474
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:03,291
know that whatever it is that turns a 
child into some monster there,

1475
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,230
Katrina,
but school,

1476
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:05,820
I think that's what needs to be 
examined.

1477
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,980
I mean this is not a part of the 
narrative.

1478
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:10,470
It's not a part of the discussions.
No one's bringing it up.

1479
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,050
All people bring up is the event 
themselves,

1480
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,150
the gun violence,
and we need to keep.

1481
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:20,151
Keep the tools away from people.
I just think the tools are one part of 

1482
01:03:20,151 --> 01:03:21,570
the problem.
I definitely think that you should.

1483
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:27,080
If there was a way we should figure out 
a way to keep psychopaths from owning 

1484
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:31,401
guns,
but how do you determine whether or not 

1485
01:03:31,401 --> 01:03:31,401
someone's a psychopath so they do 
something psychopathic?

1486
01:03:31,401 --> 01:03:31,500
Yeah,
and then someone will talk about,

1487
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:32,670
well,
you know Australia,

1488
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:34,880
they had one mass shooting in the 19 
nineties.

1489
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:37,200
They took all the guns.
There's 18 people in Australia.

1490
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:39,940
It's as big as the United States.
There's less people.

1491
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,210
Not to mention crime went up after they 
did that,

1492
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:47,510
did it.
Bottling crime went up when they did 

1493
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:49,251
that.
That's what people don't want to talk 

1494
01:03:49,251 --> 01:03:49,251
about.
And in your right,

1495
01:03:49,251 --> 01:03:51,330
like people forget context.
They're like two people in Australia.

1496
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,710
What do you know?
What about this one town in Georgia were

1497
01:03:55,711 --> 01:04:00,711
firearm ownership is mandatory.
I do remember hearing it and they made 

1498
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:03,180
it mandatory and violent crime and 
everything dropped radically.

1499
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,330
Break Ins dropped radically.
They made it mandatory.

1500
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:08,160
Everybody has to have a gun,
and everybody was like,

1501
01:04:08,161 --> 01:04:09,900
fuck a crime.
I think about it.

1502
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:12,590
I need to find a new way to make a 
living because most dudes like,

1503
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:14,370
look,
most dudes who engaged in crime,

1504
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:14,670
right?

1505
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,670
Like of course you have your Sickos who 
just loved the violence,

1506
01:04:17,671 --> 01:04:19,710
right?
Most of them just crimes of opportunity.

1507
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,310
So they're looking for victims.
They're looking for easy victims,

1508
01:04:23,311 --> 01:04:26,580
easy targets.
If you're going to deal with someone who

1509
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:29,400
possibly is going to kill you,
they don't want to die.

1510
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:34,640
Which is why you've seen a lot of these 
videos with these home invasions where 

1511
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,630
you watch when the actual homeowner has 
a firearm.

1512
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,420
Once the shot start,
once the bullets start flying,

1513
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:41,280
they're gone.
They're taken off.

1514
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:43,980
Nobody wants to get shot.
So and so.

1515
01:04:43,981 --> 01:04:46,230
It always boggles my mind when people 
are like,

1516
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:47,730
Whoa,
you don't need a gun for this,

1517
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:49,320
or you don't need to go.
I'm like,

1518
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,460
no,
I do.

1519
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,420
And they're like,
well,

1520
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,640
the chances of you ever needing it or 
using it,

1521
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:56,220
that's a stupid idea.
It's an incredibly moronic.

1522
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:01,250
Sure this.
Chances are you've gone through life 

1523
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:01,250
right now,
however old you are,

1524
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:01,830
when I'm talking to you,
you haven't been shot.

1525
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,930
So the chances are 100 percent that you 
didn't need it.

1526
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,200
Right?
But that doesn't mean you won't need any

1527
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:10,320
crazy conversation.
I don't think the conversation should be

1528
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:15,321
about the tools.
I really think the conversation should 

1529
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:15,321
be about what makes a person capable of 
doing that.

1530
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:20,330
I mean,
if the conversation is what makes a 

1531
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:22,340
person's such a fucking nut,
that they have so many guns that they 

1532
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:22,340
don't know what to do with that.
I mean,

1533
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:25,000
you have so many guns you don't even 
know how many have is that bad?

1534
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:26,830
I don't know.
Seemed like a reasonable guy.

1535
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:31,860
I'm worried about you,
but even then I can only use one gonna 

1536
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:31,860
come.
I only have two hands.

1537
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:31,860
I get that.
But the idea is like,

1538
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,820
what if someone breaks in your house and
steals your guns?

1539
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:35,980
I'm sure you haven't been a safe,
but if somebody breaks in your house and

1540
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:36,790
steals your gun,
it's like,

1541
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:37,010
what?

1542
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,140
So that's my fault.
Now that somebody wants to break the law

1543
01:05:39,141 --> 01:05:40,600
and breaking into my house.
No.

1544
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:43,120
The idea is like access.
Now you're giving access.

1545
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:43,950
Yeah.
But you eliminate limited.

1546
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,620
It's a very different argument.
You're very different.

1547
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:46,510
Yeah,
exactly.

1548
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:51,511
But you still live.
But that fundamentally goes back to the 

1549
01:05:51,511 --> 01:05:53,851
idea that people want to undervalue this
is a constitutional right,

1550
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:55,680
right?
Yeah.

1551
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,700
Um,
and so what we ended up,

1552
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:02,750
we find ourselves doing is finding ways 
to limit that ripe because of the few 

1553
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,450
bad people in our country,
you know,

1554
01:06:04,451 --> 01:06:09,451
and I just think that's the wrong way to
go about it because we're basically 

1555
01:06:09,451 --> 01:06:13,590
evolving ourselves down to a point where
we're not going to have any rights left 

1556
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:14,410
because there are a couple of bad people
here who might do something bad with the

1557
01:06:14,411 --> 01:06:19,411
rights that you have.
I think it's the wrong way to go about 

1558
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:19,411
it too.

1559
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:19,411
Um,
but if you,

1560
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:21,700
if we had no violence in this country,
if something happened,

1561
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:26,701
human beings evolved.
If our switch changed and there's no 

1562
01:06:26,701 --> 01:06:29,290
more violence,
would you still want to have guns?

1563
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,640
Yes.
You want to happen for recreation 

1564
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:35,640
because you enjoy them.
Yeah.

1565
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,820
Yeah.
That's something people don't want to 

1566
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:38,820
hear.
Yeah.

1567
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,210
Like I always tell people,
if you've never shot a gun,

1568
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:43,540
if you've ever gone to a gun range,
you should probably should because it is

1569
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,280
actually fun.
It's fun.

1570
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:50,460
Now if you do that activity and you're 
not thinking about hurting someone and 

1571
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,170
all you're thinking about is focusing on
the target,

1572
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:55,000
trigger control,
all that stuff.

1573
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,660
Is that bad?
I mean,

1574
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:57,980
we do it.

1575
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:01,150
Do anything on my show.
We call it athletic shooting.

1576
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,920
Right?
So my background before I got into guns 

1577
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:06,920
was sports.
I was in the basketball,

1578
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,040
football.
I ran cross country track,

1579
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,590
you name it.
So when I got a gun,

1580
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:14,050
so my,
my dream was to go to the Mba when I was

1581
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:14,840
younger.
Right.

1582
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,520
I'm clearly that didn't happen and it 
wasn't going to.

1583
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:24,240
But you know,
there was at that athleticism still in 

1584
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,691
me.
So what we did on the show when we were 

1585
01:07:27,691 --> 01:07:29,911
talking about coming up with a different
shooting competition was how do I 

1586
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:29,911
incorporate.
I thought it,

1587
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:34,081
well,
how do I incorporate some of the 

1588
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:34,081
athletic athleticism into shooting,
right?

1589
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:37,920
Um,
which is essentially by and large a lot 

1590
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,440
of running and just shooting a different
position and so forth and so on.

1591
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:44,070
And so when we're doing that,
I know thinking about shooting a person 

1592
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,730
that's not the type of shooting them 
doing,

1593
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:51,240
doing target,
you doing target shooting with some 

1594
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:51,240
athleticism involved in it.
And so,

1595
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,980
and people undervalue that,
like it's kind of like how can you not 

1596
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:56,040
see that these are other ways that 
firearms are used it,

1597
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:58,060
which is why I started my brand new pew,
Pew Life,

1598
01:07:58,410 --> 01:07:59,490
right?
People.

1599
01:07:59,491 --> 01:07:59,990
Life is,
is

1600
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:03,570
predicated around the EWP,
Ewp for people who don't understand that

1601
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,960
people who use guns like exact firearm 
lifestyle.

1602
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,250
Yeah.
Hashtag Po Po.

1603
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:14,600
Because mean,
think about it when we were kids was 

1604
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:14,600
also simple,
right?

1605
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:14,600
It's like cops and robbers with gun pew,
Pew,

1606
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:14,920
Pew,
Pew,

1607
01:08:14,921 --> 01:08:16,070
we do that.
And so,

1608
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,810
but then so I,
I,

1609
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:23,320
I want to capture the,
the recreation involved in playing cops 

1610
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,551
and robbers as a kid,
but then also understanding the very 

1611
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:28,460
definitive and distinction between the 
good guys and bad guys,

1612
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:33,840
right?
People who live this lifestyle are good 

1613
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:33,840
people.
They enjoy guns for recreation,

1614
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:37,130
they also understand that we live in a 
world where not everybody is good,

1615
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:42,680
right?
So we also own guns for our own self 

1616
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,651
defense and so it's this culmination of 
this lifestyle that comes together and 

1617
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:47,270
we appreciate guns in a way that some 
people think is perverse,

1618
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:48,390
but,
but,

1619
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:53,650
but how is it any less?
How is it any different than me 

1620
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:53,870
obsessing over the Aston Martin DB?
Yes.

1621
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:57,170
For the last 20 years.
That is that perverse.

1622
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,330
It's still,
it's still a mechanical item.

1623
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,110
Yes.
The potential for violence is what,

1624
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:07,120
what scares people and if they mean when
the guy kills 86 people nice with the 

1625
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,900
truck right now.

1626
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,920
It's a good point.
I mean it is a very good point and no 

1627
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:13,920
one's trying out outlaw trucks.
No,

1628
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,980
but it's this thing that we have in this
country where we have more guns than we 

1629
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:23,921
have human beings and that's,
that disturbs people yet because they 

1630
01:09:23,921 --> 01:09:26,260
inherently vilify the firearm,
which is why I have another Hashtag that

1631
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,490
I call still waiting,
still waiting for what?

1632
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,010
Still waiting for my gun to jump up on 
his own and kill somebody.

1633
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:33,310
Um,
it's,

1634
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,180
it's,
it is relatively tongue in cheek,

1635
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:37,670
but at the same time what it does is it 
transfers to focus.

1636
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:40,830
And then I say,
when a drunk driver gets behind,

1637
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:44,630
gets behind the wheel and kill someone,
we don't blame the vehicle for it.

1638
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,490
We blame the driver.
Right?

1639
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:49,550
So when somebody goes out and commits 
violence with the firearm,

1640
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:55,120
why aren't we focusing on the people who
were doing good instead of focusing on 

1641
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,120
the firearm?

1642
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,870
Well,
I think we should certainly be focusing 

1643
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,641
on the people as we said,
we should certainly be focused on 

1644
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:04,030
focusing on what happens to a person 
that makes them develop into the type of

1645
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:08,780
person that can go into a movie theater 
and shoot it up like the rural Colorado.

1646
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:14,100
Let's talk about that a little bit 
because that conversation and we don't 

1647
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:14,100
have honestly,
and I'm not going,

1648
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,160
I don't have the answers.
I can think of several things.

1649
01:10:16,161 --> 01:10:18,550
You know,
the easy answer for me is to say is it's

1650
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,670
our culture,
right?

1651
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:23,750
We maybe have a culture that facilitates
this or you know,

1652
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:26,680
we have situation where there are people
who do flip between the cracks.

1653
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,060
No one pays attention to them.
There's certainly some of that.

1654
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,620
And I do think there is a lack of hand,
right?

1655
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,280
Pay attention to everybody you can't.
But then also I think there's,

1656
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,220
like I was raised by a single parent 
mother,

1657
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:38,240
right.

1658
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:43,570
And My mother over compensated when 
raising me because she understood the 

1659
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:45,980
limitations of her being a woman raising
a young man.

1660
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:48,320
Right?
So she was unnecessarily hard on me.

1661
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,360
My mom has zero tolerance for my 
emotions,

1662
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:55,400
absolutely zero.
So what she taught me growing up was how

1663
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:59,240
to deal with adversity,
taught me how to deal with failure,

1664
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,210
how to get past those things,
taught me how to be self assured.

1665
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,960
And so what I think we're lacking to a 
degree in this country is people not 

1666
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,700
having the coping mechanisms to deal 
with failure or to deal with rejection,

1667
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:11,860
you know?
Um,

1668
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,530
so I'm getting worse than others.
I agree.

1669
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:13,860
It

1670
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,810
was definitely that.
There's definitely people that feel like

1671
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:20,811
they're outsiders and they want to flip 
the board over there losing the game and

1672
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:26,211
they just want to flip the board over 
and that seems like that Parkland kid 

1673
01:11:26,211 --> 01:11:30,510
mean there were kids that were worried 
about him before this ever happened and 

1674
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:34,641
that his whole thing was that his life 
was shit and he wanted other people to 

1675
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:35,070
experience that.
Yeah,

1676
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:40,500
and the thing is is like the hard thing 
about it too is not a realizing that 

1677
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:45,321
just came to my mind.
I think sometimes I don't even want to 

1678
01:11:45,321 --> 01:11:48,321
talk about the mental health aspect of 
it in this particular case with the 

1679
01:11:48,321 --> 01:11:48,330
parking street because I just want to 
relegate them to evil.

1680
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,350
Right?
Right.

1681
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:53,970
Because it pisses me off like you're,
you're taking innocent lives because you

1682
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:57,120
feel bad.
Go in a corner and shoot yourself.

1683
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:02,420
If that's the case,
there's a romanticized version of that 

1684
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:02,790
too,
where people just want to take everybody

1685
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:07,791
out,
take all the people out that you saw 

1686
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:07,791
that were doing well while you were 
struggling.

1687
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:08,220
There's that,
put them in,

1688
01:12:08,221 --> 01:12:13,221
but the world always flips and flips if 
you've got a good attitude and you're a 

1689
01:12:13,221 --> 01:12:16,290
healthy person like yourself,
but if you're mentally ill and your life

1690
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:21,291
has been just tormented and abuse and 
mental health issues and you're all 

1691
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:22,830
fucked up,
it's.

1692
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:27,690
I don't know what the answer is,
know what the answer is,

1693
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:32,691
but I do know that the problem lies in 
the individuals that are capable of 

1694
01:12:32,691 --> 01:12:34,050
committing that and how did they become 
that?

1695
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:39,080
Because you've got to make a great point
cause you got the mindset that you have 

1696
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,130
to be in a walk down the school hall and
just shoot people,

1697
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:42,480
shoot kids to shoot him.

1698
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:45,420
It just innocently just.
It's fucking.

1699
01:12:45,421 --> 01:12:46,520
It's fucking gross.
Yeah.

1700
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:50,430
Whether it's sandy hook or whatever.
Any one of these things like you have to

1701
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:55,431
be fucked up to do that.
Like as and how many people are running 

1702
01:12:55,431 --> 01:12:56,580
around that are like three quarters 
fucked up.

1703
01:12:56,910 --> 01:13:00,240
You only need a few bad things to go 
wrong in relatively speaking.

1704
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:05,241
When you think about the fact that 
there's 300 plus million people in this 

1705
01:13:05,241 --> 01:13:08,241
country,
these are relatively relatively few 

1706
01:13:08,241 --> 01:13:11,271
people that they are capable and that 
actually act on such terrific have a 

1707
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:16,550
act,
but what do you think can be done to 

1708
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:17,340
stop this stuff?
Have you thought about it?

1709
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,140
Yeah,
I think about it all the time.

1710
01:13:19,141 --> 01:13:19,650
It's,
it's,

1711
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:24,710
it's a harder question for me to ask 
them to come up with ways of why we 

1712
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:24,710
don't need gun control.
Right.

1713
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:25,110
You know,
because that's,

1714
01:13:25,111 --> 01:13:26,280
that's,
you know,

1715
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:26,730
it's hard.

1716
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,540
Especially when I'm taking gun control 
off the table because people are always 

1717
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:32,540
saying,
you know,

1718
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,200
you guys don't,
you guys don't want to move one inch.

1719
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:34,680
When I was like,
yeah,

1720
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:36,900
because we'd been moving in Itch for the
last 20,

1721
01:13:36,901 --> 01:13:38,550
30 years.
The problem is it's a,

1722
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:43,590
it's a fucked up argument because the 
people that are holding the guns are not

1723
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:45,720
necessarily the people that are doing 
these things.

1724
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,390
You're,
you're,

1725
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,400
you're trying to attack the,
the vast majority of gun owners are not 

1726
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:53,900
committing crimes with guns.
They're not.

1727
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,280
So when I think about what can we do to 
stop,

1728
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:58,440
it's different types of shooting.
For instance,

1729
01:13:58,441 --> 01:13:59,790
let's talk.
Let's start with the.

1730
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:04,170
Let's start with what types of shootings
that happened the most gang violence,

1731
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,430
right?
So if you look at the statistics,

1732
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:09,720
you think,
oh my gosh,

1733
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:11,470
Americans' war zone,
right?

1734
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:11,980
30,000

1735
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,980
people a year die in an eight,
and in the vast majority of it that is 

1736
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,470
remaining is actual homicides is gang 
violence.

1737
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:22,500
So then we have a gang problem.
We'd have a gang problem in this 

1738
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,291
country.
We have a socioeconomic problem in very 

1739
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:25,400
specific areas in this country,
right?

1740
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:30,810
Because I just came from south side 
Chicago where I started in high park 

1741
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:35,370
where Obama used to live and enjoy a few
minutes into an area that looked like a 

1742
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:39,331
bomb went off.
They don't have the violence in high 

1743
01:14:39,331 --> 01:14:42,481
park that they had in that area.
Why they had the same access to illegal 

1744
01:14:42,481 --> 01:14:44,950
guns.
They don't have the same problem because

1745
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:49,020
there's a difference in economics and no
one wants to do well.

1746
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:50,530
No one wants to address that,
right?

1747
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:55,680
If I'm a kid growing up in that 
neighborhood and I'm going to a school 

1748
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:55,680
that Shitty,
right?

1749
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:55,990
They don't give,
they don't give a damn about me.

1750
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,690
I looked up and was able to go to good 
schools,

1751
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:04,200
right?
I went to schools where my teachers 

1752
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,001
cared.
I went to schools where teachers pushed 

1753
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:06,280
me when I was slacking off.
You know,

1754
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:09,760
I had the ability to take out loans to 
go to a good law school.

1755
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:12,100
You know,
I had those abilities.

1756
01:15:12,101 --> 01:15:17,101
If I'm a kid growing up in this 
environment and I can't find refuge in 

1757
01:15:17,201 --> 01:15:22,201
my school,
I can't find refuge at home because my 

1758
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:22,201
mom's working three or four or five 
jobs,

1759
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,030
so she's never there.
Where am I going to go find parents?

1760
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:30,060
I'm going to,
where am I going to find that parental 

1761
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:30,060
influence?
I'm gonna find on the streets.

1762
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,660
So now I'm on the streets being led by 
people who grew up in the exact 

1763
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,360
conditions that I grew up in and so now 
I'm like,

1764
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:35,440
okay,
well I have to make money.

1765
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,270
What am I going to do for money?
Well,

1766
01:15:37,271 --> 01:15:40,270
then there's the Naco economy.
Very conveniently right there for me,

1767
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,410
right?
So drugs.

1768
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:47,010
So now I'm selling.
Now I'm saying on the corner selling 

1769
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:47,010
drugs,
I got to protect my product,

1770
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:47,970
right?
If I don't,

1771
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,630
someone's gonna take it from me.
So what do I do?

1772
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:51,160
I get a gun,
I carry a gun.

1773
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:56,230
Now I'm stuck in the true.
Now I'm just stuck in this violent loop,

1774
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,690
right?
If that feeds on itself,

1775
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,870
and so now I'm stuck defending myself 
against the guy who shooting at me,

1776
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:03,580
trying to take my stuff and I'm shooting
back at him.

1777
01:16:03,581 --> 01:16:05,170
Maybe not because I'm trying to take 
your stuff,

1778
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,250
but because he's trying to take them 
out,

1779
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:12,290
right?
So that's where you get that violence 

1780
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:12,290
that comes from that,
from those particular areas.

1781
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:12,820
Now,
if we would have sat back and said,

1782
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:17,821
okay,
we have hyper concentrated areas in this

1783
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:19,870
country,
this is a widespread.

1784
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,410
It's hyper concentrated communities in 
this country that are dealing with this,

1785
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,980
that are also the result of the vast 
majority of our gun violence.

1786
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:30,100
If we sat back and thought about it from
a socioeconomic standpoint,

1787
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,410
how do we fix this?
What do we do?

1788
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:37,411
How do we present opportunity,
I'm not saying go there and just hand 

1789
01:16:37,411 --> 01:16:40,491
out stuff,
but how do we fix this from the 

1790
01:16:40,491 --> 01:16:40,660
standpoint of improving our schools?
How is that can drive five minutes,

1791
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:45,210
one direction and have a school that has
everything you can name and then driving

1792
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:48,190
into driving the opposite direction.
The school has can barely have textbooks

1793
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,800
to give to the kids.
Think about that.

1794
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:56,100
So why?
Why aren't we focusing our energy on 

1795
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:56,830
building data up versus talking about,
oh,

1796
01:16:56,831 --> 01:16:59,140
we need to get the guns off the streets.
You did that.

1797
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:04,170
You had that in Chicago.
You have every gun law imaginable in 

1798
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:04,690
Chicago,
but just outside Chicago still looks the

1799
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:07,030
way that it does still as a violence 
that it does.

1800
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:08,460
Right?
So if we would,

1801
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:09,920
if we provide,

1802
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:15,700
when you give people something lose or 
the lift for they don't throw away life 

1803
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,360
so easily.
Plain and simple.

1804
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,690
So if my social economic status is in 
the dirt,

1805
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:24,560
I don't have a problem looking at 
another kid down the street and shooting

1806
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:27,740
at him and taking his life.
I don't have anything.

1807
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:33,810
I don't have anything to lose.
But if we were to focus our attention 

1808
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:37,121
and fixing that same way we talk about 
the mental health issue with respect to 

1809
01:17:37,121 --> 01:17:39,530
mass shootings and school shootings,
we wouldn't have to worry about the guns

1810
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:44,531
because we don't have people wanting to 
do those things or have the capability 

1811
01:17:44,531 --> 01:17:44,630
to do those things.
Right.

1812
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:49,220
So then that deals with that vast 
majority of the violence that we had.

1813
01:17:49,221 --> 01:17:52,190
They're focusing that energy in fixing 
those communities.

1814
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:54,680
I agree with you 100 percent,
and we've talked about this many,

1815
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:59,681
many times in the show that I think that
if you wanted to make America a better 

1816
01:17:59,681 --> 01:18:01,100
place,
one of the best ways to do it is to make

1817
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:03,380
it easier for someone to succeed.

1818
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:08,680
Make it easy and,
and stop pretending that it's a level 

1819
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,111
playing field.
Because I didn't grow up in a level 

1820
01:18:11,111 --> 01:18:11,111
playing field and I got lucky.
I got lucky.

1821
01:18:11,111 --> 01:18:15,461
A lot of people did.
And if you go to somewhere like the 

1822
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:15,620
south side of Chicago and you don't 
realize that you got lucky,

1823
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:16,390
you,
you're,

1824
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:17,310
you're blind.
Yeah,

1825
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,960
there's,
we want them.

1826
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,190
What's the best way to make America 
stronger?

1827
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:24,940
Less losers.
Less people who lose their how did,

1828
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,810
how has that will give them more of a 
chance,

1829
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,570
give them more of an opportunity and 
give them guidance,

1830
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:32,390
ship community centers,
clean up the streets,

1831
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:37,540
fixed buildings,
but that's a lot of fucking money that 

1832
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:40,151
we're spending right now in Afghanistan 
and Iraq and missiles and all kinds of 

1833
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:42,410
crazy shit that we're not putting any 
money into that.

1834
01:18:42,411 --> 01:18:44,730
But then who do we hold accountable?
We.

1835
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:49,780
So for instance,
do we like when we talk about the inner 

1836
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:49,780
cities,
for instance,

1837
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:53,080
[inaudible],
they had been democratically run for 

1838
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:53,540
ages.
Now the local leadership,

1839
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:54,770
there's democratic,
right?

1840
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:57,620
But there's no money there.
The problem is there's the money's going

1841
01:18:57,621 --> 01:18:59,160
somewhere.
I me look at Chicago,

1842
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:00,530
just not enough.
I mean the,

1843
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:05,531
the,
the money's going into the areas where 

1844
01:19:05,531 --> 01:19:05,531
people are wealthy and that's what 
they're supporting.

1845
01:19:05,531 --> 01:19:06,260
They're not supporting these 
impoverished areas.

1846
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:09,020
And then you know what?
You're absolutely right.

1847
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:15,220
So if that's the case and we all 
understand that and you know that stop 

1848
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:15,220
selling this bullshit about gun control 
there,

1849
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,830
but let's just tell you,
that's just one,

1850
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,910
one aspect to the next one.
Yeah,

1851
01:19:19,911 --> 01:19:22,370
I agree with you there.
So in that sense,

1852
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:27,460
in when it comes to gun violence,
it's very complex when it comes to gang 

1853
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:31,151
violence,
it's very complex and I agree with you 

1854
01:19:31,151 --> 01:19:31,151
that they need.

1855
01:19:31,151 --> 01:19:34,450
There's no other way to stop that then 
to fix the inner cities where people are

1856
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:39,890
just in that cycle of constant poverty 
and crime and that's all they see around

1857
01:19:39,891 --> 01:19:41,600
them.
So it becomes normalized.

1858
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:42,830
Yeah,
absolutely.

1859
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,780
So,
so now let's talk about mass shootings.

1860
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:45,950
Mass shootings,
right?

1861
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:51,490
So get rid of gun free zones.
No one wants to hear that.

1862
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:57,520
Get rid of gun free zones.
If you're not going to establish a 

1863
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,550
perimeter outside of a building where I 
can go,

1864
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,770
don't tell me I can't bring my gun in 
there.

1865
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,850
A sign on the window is not stopping 
somebody from coming into the building.

1866
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,680
We've seen it time and time and time and
time again.

1867
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,920
If the guns were the problems,
we would have mass shooting at every gun

1868
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:14,250
show every single day.
What we don't.

1869
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,550
Why the same reason you pointed out why 
that one,

1870
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:20,430
that one place in Georgia when they said
everybody had to have a gun,

1871
01:20:20,431 --> 01:20:21,240
crime went down.

1872
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:24,260
People don't want to hear that though.
They don't want to hear that.

1873
01:20:24,261 --> 01:20:27,530
The answer to gun violence is everyone 
has a gun.

1874
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:34,390
Now,
not such a convenient answer for a guy 

1875
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:34,620
like you as very convenient.
So many guns can't count.

1876
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:36,060
But here,
let's look at the alternative.

1877
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,020
We've been living in it,
right?

1878
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,780
Right.
And we know that there's a problem.

1879
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:44,130
So why are we entertaining in the fact 
that maybe that is the case,

1880
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:49,150
right?
But do you think that like school 

1881
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:51,171
shootings for example,
do you think that these teachers being 

1882
01:20:51,171 --> 01:20:52,680
armed would be the answer?
All right,

1883
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,550
so what do you think there should be 
armed security on the campus?

1884
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,580
I say it should be multilayered,
right?

1885
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:04,700
Because if you,
if you really want to put things into 

1886
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:04,830
perspective and the NRA didn't add about
this and people got pissed off,

1887
01:21:04,831 --> 01:21:05,580
but it's the truth.

1888
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:08,940
Wherever whatever school the president's
kids go to,

1889
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,450
they are guarded by guns,
right?

1890
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:14,570
At school was protected by guns.
Right.

1891
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,800
Anything we hold valuable in this 
country is protected with guns.

1892
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:25,010
No one is more anti gun than Hollywood.
When you hear about any sort of crime or

1893
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:32,901
gun violence,
the left wing people in Hollywood are 

1894
01:21:32,901 --> 01:21:36,921
the most vocal,
the most virtue signaling the quickest 

1895
01:21:36,921 --> 01:21:38,190
to jump on their pedestal.
Meanwhile,

1896
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,540
what percentage of their fucking movies 
involve gun violence?

1897
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:47,600
And if you look at the Academy Awards,
did you see the security at the Academy 

1898
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,410
Awards?
You see all these left leaning liberal 

1899
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:55,400
actors being protected by people of flak
jackets on carrying guns with fingers 

1900
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:58,920
outside the triggers.
I mean dogs,

1901
01:21:58,950 --> 01:21:59,910
but yeah,
it's crazy.

1902
01:21:59,911 --> 01:22:03,930
You know what it is though.
It's a loss of touch with reality.

1903
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:06,440
Well,
there are also insulated and protected.

1904
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:09,720
That's part of it because in their mind 
their mindset goes like this.

1905
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,660
Well,
I have security guards.

1906
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:13,850
I mean,
Kim Kardashians,

1907
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,360
the biggest.

1908
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:18,900
I did a video on that,
so I did.

1909
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,950
That was the first thing that came to 
vegas.

1910
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:22,110
What she biggest hypocrite on that,
right?

1911
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:25,080
Because she's a dumb dumb of course,
but she's.

1912
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:30,081
She also influences a ton of people.
That's unfortunate.

1913
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,030
But exactly.
Steve Harvey hat or on family feud,

1914
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:38,390
they were on family feud that 
Kardashians the whether we're talking 

1915
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,720
about how fucking stupid kid was,
but we know this though.

1916
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:44,810
That's the crazy thing.
There's no incentive for her to be 

1917
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:44,810
intelligent.
There isn't.

1918
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:46,480
I mean she's good at making money.
Just show.

1919
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:47,720
Absolutely.
Yeah,

1920
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:49,680
absolutely.
And I don't fault her for that.

1921
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,400
Hey,
make you money.

1922
01:22:50,401 --> 01:22:51,420
But we're.
But,

1923
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,600
but at the end of the day,
you still,

1924
01:22:56,670 --> 01:23:00,220
she still has access to scores of young 
influential rides.

1925
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:01,860
I understand that.
That's unfortunate,

1926
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:03,180
but there's nothing we can do about 
that,

1927
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,130
but other than you point out the fact 
that she's

1928
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,600
a dumb dumb.
Pretty much.

1929
01:23:07,601 --> 01:23:08,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

1930
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:11,050
Yeah.
It's not terrible person.

1931
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:13,010
I don't think it's been.
I don't know.

1932
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,610
I don't know the one.
I just don't know.

1933
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:19,630
I've heard her talk.
I just don't think she's really 

1934
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:19,660
interested in expanding your mind.
I just don't think that that's something

1935
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,590
that's not benefits booklets her.
Here's the thing though.

1936
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:28,380
The mindset though is there are people 
who we paid to carry guns,

1937
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,330
right?
I don't need to carry them.

1938
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:36,331
Therefore you don't either.
So what you're saying about her is that 

1939
01:23:36,331 --> 01:23:38,050
she is anti gun,
she talks about being anti gun,

1940
01:23:38,051 --> 01:23:40,390
yet she's constantly surrounded by 
people who have guns.

1941
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,550
That's a fact.
Absolute fact.

1942
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:45,220
So you cancel this fact so then you 
can't turn around and tell me that.

1943
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:46,900
No,
you don't need a firearm.

1944
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:51,580
Of course you don't pitch seven foot 
tall dudes strapped to the fucking gills

1945
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,810
all around you.

1946
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:54,700
So it's,
it's,

1947
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,180
it,
it,

1948
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:57,370
it's,
it's man.

1949
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:00,280
It's frustrating because it's like,
I get it.

1950
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:03,850
I would love to have eight dudes 
standing out here with Ar,

1951
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:08,910
15 slung over their shoulders ready to 
protect me at have given notice where I 

1952
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:08,910
could afford it.
I pay for it,

1953
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:13,610
not do it.
The funny thing is I still carry a gun 

1954
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:13,610
on me because I can't always be exactly 
where I am.

1955
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:14,410
Right.
You know what I mean?

1956
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,210
That's a paranoid way to live though,
isn't it?

1957
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:18,820
What difference does it make you think 
about it?

1958
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:21,040
How much does it affect me?
I wake up everyday,

1959
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:26,041
put a gun on my hip and go out and do 
the exact same thing I would do if I 

1960
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:26,041
didn't have it.
But you don't think about it.

1961
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:26,290
So in the.
In a sense,

1962
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:28,420
you feel like you're not paranoid.
I'm not paranoid.

1963
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:29,460
No,
there's no.

1964
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,020
No,
no,

1965
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:35,160
no more paranoid than any than any 
person that has a fire extinguisher in 

1966
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:35,160
their house.
Think about it.

1967
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,120
It's a.
it's like I don't walk around like,

1968
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:38,350
Oh my God,
my God,

1969
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,370
who's,
who's coming to get me?

1970
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:40,830
That's paranoia.
What?

1971
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:45,840
What?
All I'm doing is being prepared right 

1972
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:45,840
now.
There could be levels of preparedness.

1973
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,230
You start to get hit diminishing 
returns.

1974
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:50,590
Where starts to be in like it starts to 
take away from your quality of life,

1975
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:56,160
but me putting a gun on my hip and just 
going about my business that doesn't 

1976
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:56,340
interfere with my life enough to say,
you know what?

1977
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,210
It's not quite worth it.
You know?

1978
01:24:58,211 --> 01:25:03,211
It's funny what you said about humility 
and that you like more calm and relaxed 

1979
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:07,750
since you've been involved with guns.
The same thing happens with Jujitsu.

1980
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:13,110
Martial arts training in particular,
but Jujitsu in particular because you 

1981
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:13,110
get strangled so much.

1982
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:15,760
My neck hurts right now because I was 
rolling with a guy just before I came up

1983
01:25:15,761 --> 01:25:17,780
like last week.
And um,

1984
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,570
it,
it man,

1985
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,760
it's such a beautiful sport.
It's beautiful,

1986
01:25:21,761 --> 01:25:25,360
but it also lets you know your place in 
the food chain,

1987
01:25:25,361 --> 01:25:29,440
especially when you first start out,
you start to realize you really honestly

1988
01:25:29,441 --> 01:25:32,470
can't call out an elite human until it's
too late.

1989
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,070
What do you mean?
So when I started,

1990
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:39,160
before I started really kind of getting 
into mma,

1991
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:44,161
so forth and so on,
I thought I could spot out the guy you 

1992
01:25:44,161 --> 01:25:44,161
don't want to mess with.
Oh,

1993
01:25:44,161 --> 01:25:45,250
right.
You know what I mean?

1994
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:50,280
Yeah.
And then I went to class and then he 

1995
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,400
knew my coach started pairing me with 
different people and I'm like,

1996
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:56,940
holy crap.
Like if I was seeing this dude was just 

1997
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:56,940
walking down the sidewalk,
I'm like,

1998
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:56,940
yeah,
I can handle him.

1999
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,180
And now I'm rolled up.
The Pretzel was nuts in my face.

2000
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:03,140
Narrowed assassins assassins?
Yeah man.

2001
01:26:03,141 --> 01:26:04,030
At Tenth Planet we've

2002
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:06,830
got a whole army of him.
He would still a computer dorks,

2003
01:26:06,831 --> 01:26:08,140
no kill you with their legs.
Yup.

2004
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,850
The wrap their legs around your neck and
choke you to sleep,

2005
01:26:10,851 --> 01:26:12,360
but you can't even stop it from 
happening.

2006
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:13,760
That's crazy.
Nothing man.

2007
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:18,761
And then my.
Now I always get stuck and I'm going to 

2008
01:26:18,761 --> 01:26:18,761
overpower him and I'm like,
Nah,

2009
01:26:18,761 --> 01:26:19,820
you better off being week.
Believe it or not,

2010
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:22,550
the best Jujitsu is weak man's Jujitsu.
I always say,

2011
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:27,551
if you're going to learn Jiu Jitsu 
learning from a small guy because you 

2012
01:26:27,551 --> 01:26:27,551
learn from a small guy,
they.

2013
01:26:27,551 --> 01:26:29,350
They've never been able to cheat,
meaning they never been able to.

2014
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:32,510
I've always had to have perfect 
technique,

2015
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:34,130
techniques,
everything.

2016
01:26:34,131 --> 01:26:37,130
When it comes to Jitsu,
literally you have to have some strength

2017
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:42,340
for sure and strength with technique is 
the ultimate but perfect technique is 

2018
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:46,580
where it's at and you get that from like
little guys like Barrett Yoshida,

2019
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:49,880
Eddie Bravo,
heuler grace of the smaller guys are the

2020
01:26:49,881 --> 01:26:53,030
ones that you want to learn from because
they've never been the big guy.

2021
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:57,110
The big guys are like top game guys.
Smash past guys.

2022
01:26:57,111 --> 01:27:00,170
Those guys were just relying on 
horsepower and leg strength and shit.

2023
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:02,240
Those,
that's not the way to learn,

2024
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,150
you know,
the way to learn is to go around things.

2025
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,540
Gotcha.
And you know,

2026
01:27:06,541 --> 01:27:08,900
the funny thing about that is it,
do you know why I started doing it?

2027
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:11,170
Why someone said would if there took 
your gun away,

2028
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:13,460
Bro?
No one said that.

2029
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:15,260
I said it to myself.
Oh right.

2030
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:16,340
So to myself,
because I didn't,

2031
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:21,670
I almost thought I was over dependent on
it because when remember the gun is a 

2032
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:21,970
tool.
She carried a knife too.

2033
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,490
I used to.
She's like that's bitch I used to but I,

2034
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:26,420
I float,
I float.

2035
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:30,350
I'm in this weird space where like,
my jeans are kind of sorted a little too

2036
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:33,440
tight and not so they're not quite 
skinny jeans,

2037
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:36,010
but it's Kinda like after a certain 
point I have too much stuff going on in.

2038
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:37,310
I got the answer for you.
My friend,

2039
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,760
let's call called a fanny pack.
Uh,

2040
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:47,050
you know,
they're not gonna let me get away with 

2041
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:48,191
that.
Fuck you talking about higher 

2042
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:48,440
primate.com.
You go buy one right now.

2043
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:49,940
I'll give you one.
Do we have some here?

2044
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,620
You would.
You never wear this.

2045
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,300
You would never wear this.
I'm down to try anything.

2046
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:55,320
Come on man.
Tactically,

2047
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:57,590
tactical wallet.
Some of them,

2048
01:27:57,591 --> 01:27:59,540
but they have ones that are tactical 
ones.

2049
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:04,541
They rip them open.
Do you have a tactical and I'm all for 

2050
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:04,541
it.
No,

2051
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:08,290
this is just a regular one.
So this should keep the shit on you so 

2052
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:09,020
you don't have your pockets all filled 
with shit to here's my life.

2053
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,350
Here's my favorite part.
This is what I consider fairly pack.

2054
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,380
Oh,
that's a little big.

2055
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:12,890
Yeah,
I know.

2056
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:15,920
But then again,
I'm the guy who carried it,

2057
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,260
but I'm the guy who runs around with Mac
book,

2058
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:19,420
Ipad,
you know,

2059
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:20,750
because I have carried when everywhere.

2060
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:24,110
Pretty much if I can pay you back 
because I'm constantly working.

2061
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:24,920
Writing,
working?

2062
01:28:24,921 --> 01:28:25,910
Yeah.
What do you.

2063
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:27,500
Would you like,
what kind of stuff do you write?

2064
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,660
Script?
Pretty much 80 to 90 percent of my show.

2065
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:30,650
Oh,
okay.

2066
01:28:30,651 --> 01:28:31,540
Yeah.
Oh no kidding.

2067
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:31,870
Yeah,
I,

2068
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,590
I write all,
all the videos I do.

2069
01:28:33,591 --> 01:28:35,260
I write them.
Do you write them in?

2070
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:37,040
They put them on a teleprompter or do 
you practice it?

2071
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:39,340
Sometimes it straight off the tops and,
and teleprompter.

2072
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:44,350
It just depends what we feel is going to
give the communicate the best to what 

2073
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:44,350
you're trying to achieve.
Oh,

2074
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:45,010
that's cool.
Well that's,

2075
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,150
it shows work ethic for sure.
I mean,

2076
01:28:47,151 --> 01:28:48,350
I don't,
I don't have a life,

2077
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,150
you know,
I really don't.

2078
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:53,030
All I do is work,
work out and eat.

2079
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,290
So is this,
these videos?

2080
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:58,970
Is this your tired life now?
For the most part,

2081
01:28:58,971 --> 01:29:01,120
yeah.
And in terms of your occupation?

2082
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:02,940
So you don't work as a lawyer?
Um,

2083
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,580
I do a little bit.
I still have things with a small firm in

2084
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:06,940
Houston.
Um,

2085
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:11,990
and then so other than that,
just other investments and things that 

2086
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:11,990
have gone on,
that's about it.

2087
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:13,140
So you're able to make a living off of 
these videos.

2088
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:18,660
There was a time when you could do it on
youtube anymore?

2089
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,590
Yeah,
it's real recent.

2090
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,880
Within the last six or seven months.
Well actually a gun guy started noticing

2091
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:26,430
that drop a long time ago.
Like I'm talking about.

2092
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:31,730
We went from like to like half.
Yeah.

2093
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,910
And then now it's like 70 percent.
So in that happened,

2094
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:37,770
that happened like a couple of years 
ago.

2095
01:29:37,810 --> 01:29:42,810
And how does that work in terms of like,
did they pick certain videos that are 

2096
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:46,461
just not eligible for monetizations?
I would have known before it was just a 

2097
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:48,760
drop in organic reach.
It just started like it wasn't,

2098
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:49,980
it wasn't anything formal.

2099
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:55,110
At least that's what I picked up on 
because I started noticing.

2100
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:55,770
I'm like,
wait a minute.

2101
01:29:56,070 --> 01:30:01,070
Like,
I mean I wasn't living off the youtube 

2102
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:01,070
stuff,
but I was like,

2103
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:02,970
this is like,
I just kept my income cut in half.

2104
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,100
It's weird.
Yeah.

2105
01:30:05,101 --> 01:30:10,101
Well there's,
there's been some people that have 

2106
01:30:10,101 --> 01:30:12,350
investigated this and there's been some 
inside sources have told people that 

2107
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:14,940
they actively target conservatives,
gun owners,

2108
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:16,230
redneck.
They do it on twitter.

2109
01:30:16,231 --> 01:30:17,730
They do it a lot,
a lot of different places.

2110
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,660
I don't doubt it.
I don't know.

2111
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,780
One hundred percent.
Where's that guy?

2112
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:27,770
American provider Guy that did those 
undercover investigative reports.

2113
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:33,440
He sent a bunch of people into like bars
and talk to twitter engineers.

2114
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:39,720
Um,
you know what I'm talking about.

2115
01:30:39,721 --> 01:30:41,250
Yeah.
Now I will say this though,

2116
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:46,251
there are so like there are certain 
people in these places that are 

2117
01:30:46,251 --> 01:30:46,950
actually,
they may not even agree with my stance,

2118
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:49,230
but I've talked to them and they'll help
me out the best that they can.

2119
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:50,730
You know,
some people on facebook,

2120
01:30:50,731 --> 01:30:54,030
some people youtube so and so on because
they're all those individuals,

2121
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:59,031
you know,
the column column go support is in a 

2122
01:30:59,031 --> 01:31:00,180
sense because you know they can be more 
explicit about the,

2123
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:00,860
you know,
yeah.

2124
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:03,000
You're not going to have just a complete
uniform,

2125
01:31:03,001 --> 01:31:08,001
left wing ideology at any of these 
organizations are going to be some 

2126
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:11,061
people that,
but they get stuck in these group think 

2127
01:31:11,061 --> 01:31:13,170
environments like Google or wherever the
fuck it is and they can't speak out.

2128
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,140
Which is unfortunate because I'm like,
isn't this country?

2129
01:31:16,141 --> 01:31:21,141
This country was founded on the idea of 
having having a release,

2130
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:26,070
undercover footage of twitter employees 
and employees,

2131
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:31,730
engineers and employees,
admitting that twitter employees view 

2132
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:35,121
everything you post on their servers,
including private sex messages and Dick 

2133
01:31:35,121 --> 01:31:35,780
pics because that's why.
That's why I don't send them.

2134
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:41,470
I've never seen engineers also admit 
that twitter analyzes this information 

2135
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:44,230
to create a virtual profile of you,
which they sell to advertisers.

2136
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:49,250
James O'keefe has completed the book 
about the series entitled American 

2137
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:53,271
provider,
my fight for the truth in the era of 

2138
01:31:53,271 --> 01:31:53,271
fake news.
Yeah.

2139
01:31:53,271 --> 01:31:56,930
So this guy has sent a bunch of people 
to talk to like engineers and I've seen 

2140
01:31:57,661 --> 01:32:00,010
the videos where they're explaining how

2141
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:05,010
they a dog a rhythm and how they make it
so that these people don't even know 

2142
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:06,970
that people can't see their,
their tweets or give it all the time.

2143
01:32:06,971 --> 01:32:08,800
People to send it to me all the time 
like,

2144
01:32:08,801 --> 01:32:10,090
hey,
you know,

2145
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:12,790
um,
for some reason youtube is forcing me to

2146
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:14,620
unfollow you.
Like thought I followed you,

2147
01:32:14,621 --> 01:32:19,621
but then I'm not following you.
And I think some of that's paranoia and 

2148
01:32:19,621 --> 01:32:19,621
I do.
Some of it is,

2149
01:32:19,621 --> 01:32:20,490
some of it isn't.
Um,

2150
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:23,440
but it still begs the question because 
the numbers don't lie.

2151
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:24,760
Right?
So like,

2152
01:32:24,761 --> 01:32:27,910
I know with facebook there was times I 
was reaching millions of people but just

2153
01:32:27,911 --> 01:32:30,880
to post.
But then that got cut in half.

2154
01:32:30,881 --> 01:32:32,890
But largely that was due to 
monetization,

2155
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,380
that was before facebook was monetizing 
itself.

2156
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:40,590
So they wanted to cotton now there they 
want you to pay to get access to your 

2157
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:40,590
audience.

2158
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,640
You get what I'm saying so that I don't 
like it,

2159
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:48,390
but it isn't,
it isn't like some deep secret kind of 

2160
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:48,390
like,
oh,

2161
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:50,770
I want to stifle your reach because you 
believe in it's now there may be some of

2162
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:52,210
that going on.
Right?

2163
01:32:52,211 --> 01:32:53,470
So I had,
for instance,

2164
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:57,550
like I buy ads for my merchandise,
sell on facebook,

2165
01:32:57,551 --> 01:32:59,950
right?
Because if I just post a picture of it,

2166
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:02,260
my entire artist doesn't see it.
Right.

2167
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:07,330
And so somebody went through facebook 
and just deleted all of our ads,

2168
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:10,330
like especially toward money on ads and 
they just delete,

2169
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:15,331
disapproved them out of nowhere.
And so then I called the contact and 

2170
01:33:15,331 --> 01:33:15,331
then it was like,
no,

2171
01:33:15,331 --> 01:33:19,951
that should've happened.
And then it went back and put it back 

2172
01:33:19,951 --> 01:33:19,951
up.
So sometimes it's even individualized,

2173
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:25,020
you know what I mean?
It's just an individual who disagrees 

2174
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:25,020
with everything you stand for.

2175
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:25,600
Who has the power to do it.
When you remember when that guy did that

2176
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:28,540
with trump is disabled,
is twitter really did it for a couple of

2177
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,590
days?
You know,

2178
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,990
there's definitely people that have that
kind of power and they abuse it.

2179
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:36,670
I mean,
you see that everywhere.

2180
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:39,040
You see that with moderators on message 
boards.

2181
01:33:39,041 --> 01:33:44,041
You see that with every time people have
more power than you and they go,

2182
01:33:44,261 --> 01:33:47,620
I don't like this fucking guy,
this guy talking about his guns.

2183
01:33:47,621 --> 01:33:49,990
Fuck his ass,
and they just yank them.

2184
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:55,020
The weird thing is though,
like I don't complain about it on my 

2185
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,230
platform at all because no one cares.
Yeah.

2186
01:33:56,350 --> 01:34:01,350
Because I remember the first time 
youtube started taking off taking like 

2187
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:04,501
demonetizing my videos for ads.
I mentioned it and a lot of people were 

2188
01:34:04,501 --> 01:34:04,501
like,
good,

2189
01:34:04,501 --> 01:34:07,570
I don't like those ads anyway.
You do realize I have to pay to get this

2190
01:34:07,571 --> 01:34:08,080
stuff done.

2191
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,450
Right.
You know?

2192
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:14,810
Well no one seems to care until it comes
and affects them because they don't 

2193
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,480
realize that essentially what they're 
doing is they're,

2194
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:21,880
they're censoring you by diminishing the
amount of money that you can make.

2195
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:22,610
Yeah.
You know,

2196
01:34:22,611 --> 01:34:24,790
you could,
you could say it's not real censorship,

2197
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:26,220
but it is censorship.
I mean it's,

2198
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:31,240
it's,
it's pretty much what I'm dealing with 

2199
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:31,240
right now.
So for instance,

2200
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:31,240
right now my videos don't come out as 
consistently.

2201
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,340
Like I do good reviews.
I'm known for my gun reviews.

2202
01:34:33,341 --> 01:34:38,341
Right.
And I liked my grandmother used to be 

2203
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:38,341
very cinematic voiceover.
I put thought into them.

2204
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:42,960
I write scripts out from my videos.
The problem is too now before where I 

2205
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,710
could afford to hire someone to edit 
them,

2206
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:50,190
I can't write and I need that now more 
than ever because now on the political 

2207
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:51,220
front of the things I'm running around,
I'm traveling.

2208
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:52,600
That's why I was having my Mac book with
me.

2209
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:57,720
I have to try to find places where I can
try to edit a little bit and get things 

2210
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:57,720
done.
But then the same people who were like,

2211
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:57,800
we don't care about

2212
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,100
the ads on your videos and you make your
money from your,

2213
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:05,140
from your videos are saint people like 
why aren't you making videos as much as 

2214
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:05,140
you used to?
Well,

2215
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:05,140
I'm like,
well,

2216
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:07,970
I don't have the money to pay someone to
edit the videos in order to keep pumping

2217
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:12,971
them out the way I was doing it before 
and I'm not going to give you some sub 

2218
01:35:12,971 --> 01:35:12,971
quality crap.
Right.

2219
01:35:12,971 --> 01:35:14,270
I could just toss a video together and 
just throw it out there.

2220
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:19,830
It's just too much noise.
You can't listen to all those people 

2221
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:19,830
that are complaining and asking for 
things,

2222
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:21,170
which is true,
but I really.

2223
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:26,240
I really do think that twitter or 
youtube rather is fucking up because 

2224
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:30,221
they're opening up the door to a 
competitor that is really invested in 

2225
01:35:30,221 --> 01:35:31,370
free speech.
I disagree.

2226
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:32,750
Really?
How so?

2227
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,110
It's the advertisers.
They are at the.

2228
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:37,430
They are at the mercy of the 
advertisers.

2229
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:40,790
They are,
but I know people over at Youtube,

2230
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:44,350
they are deciding what they want said 
and not Sacha,

2231
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:47,150
and this is how I know.
I brought up Jordan Peterson,

2232
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:50,720
this woman that worked at huge fan of 
and she said he's a troublemaker,

2233
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,370
and I said,
how is he a troublemaker?

2234
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:57,550
She had no answer.
She radical left wing but not 

2235
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:57,550
thoughtful,
not,

2236
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:58,160
not thoughtful.
Like she.

2237
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:00,450
She'd just have a good argument for this
and when you did,

2238
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:03,710
when you pushed back,
she's used to being the boss at work.

2239
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:07,880
She's used to just dismissing you and 
when I was pushing back with her like,

2240
01:36:07,881 --> 01:36:08,870
why?
Why is that?

2241
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,430
Why?
Why is he a troublemaker?

2242
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:11,930
Like you're telling me what's 
problematic,

2243
01:36:11,931 --> 01:36:13,520
but what he says,
no answer to that,

2244
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:18,550
but yet able to dismissively say 
someone's a troublemaker when they're a 

2245
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:22,241
very highly respected intellectual that 
has amazing points about a lot of 

2246
01:36:22,241 --> 01:36:22,880
different things that resonates with a 
lot of very,

2247
01:36:22,881 --> 01:36:23,810
very smart people.

2248
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,620
I think he's the nature of our time.
He's a very bright guy in a,

2249
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:29,120
in a really good human.
When you meet him,

2250
01:36:29,121 --> 01:36:34,121
he's a really good person.
So for someone just say he's a 

2251
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:34,121
troublemaker,
like okay,

2252
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:38,970
no because he doesn't agree with you and
he's causing trouble with your 

2253
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:42,731
organization because you're censoring 
people's views and viewpoints and it's 

2254
01:36:42,731 --> 01:36:46,190
so convenient to read the label.
Someone all right or you know,

2255
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:48,980
this is,
this is what we're dealing with today.

2256
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:52,520
There's these hate identity politics.
It drives me insane.

2257
01:36:52,521 --> 01:36:55,040
It's crazy.
It's crazy how many people flocked to it

2258
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:57,950
too because it's intellectually easier 
varies.

2259
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:03,640
It's very easy.
You can sit there and then you just re 

2260
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:04,820
just regurgitate all of the talking 
points that you have.

2261
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:09,770
This is why I don't do well on cable 
news hits because what ends up happening

2262
01:37:09,771 --> 01:37:12,770
is like on this issue,
I intellectualize it,

2263
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:13,160
right?

2264
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:16,400
Like the conversation we're having now,
like I get the benefit.

2265
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,640
I love this because we could sit here if
we need to think about something.

2266
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:21,410
You know?
That's a good point.

2267
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:26,640
Yeah.
Let me think about that for a little 

2268
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:26,640
like on cable news and you can't do 
that.

2269
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:27,470
You can't do that.
I just did this kind of platforms,

2270
01:37:27,471 --> 01:37:30,410
the best platform because the 
conversation is never interrupted.

2271
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:33,230
He never stopped for ads and no one can 
tell someone to.

2272
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:35,480
I'm about to go to the bathroom.
Here you go ahead,

2273
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:37,490
man.
Sorry we could wrap this up soon,

2274
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:42,530
but I wanted to.
I really wanted to get to other than not

2275
01:37:42,531 --> 01:37:44,130
having gun free zones.
Yeah.

2276
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:46,790
I mean not having everyone armed to the 
teeth and.

2277
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:47,300
Well,
no.

2278
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:48,050
Here's,
here's the thing.

2279
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,050
Here's the thing.
I was saying if you're going to have gun

2280
01:37:51,051 --> 01:37:54,740
free zones,
make them real gun gun free zones.

2281
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,010
Don't just put a sticker on the

2282
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:01,010
window and then say you can't bring your
gun in here and then not have physical 

2283
01:38:01,051 --> 01:38:06,051
measures in place to prevent it because 
otherwise I'm allowed to prevent it to 

2284
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,300
have like some movie theater or 
something.

2285
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,730
If you have a movie theater,
have them.

2286
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:10,780
If you're gonna,
make it a gun free zone.

2287
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:13,860
Have a metal detector and the metal 
detector goes off.

2288
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:16,590
You're still fucking guns in the room.
And what are you gonna do you have armed

2289
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:18,450
guards to keep people from?
So then.

2290
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:21,390
So then don't make it a gun free zone.
Right?

2291
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:23,490
Okay.
But even if you don't mean,

2292
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:28,500
okay,
say if you have a gun free zone and you 

2293
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:28,500
have a movie theater and you put the 
metal detectors on,

2294
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,030
the only way to enforce that is to have 
guns.

2295
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,160
Okay?
Yeah.

2296
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:33,750
But you know what I'm saying?
So if you want to hire,

2297
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:36,180
if you want to hire,
if you want to hire armed guard to stand

2298
01:38:36,181 --> 01:38:37,500
there,
right?

2299
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:42,560
With the metal detectors,
because of the metal detectors are only 

2300
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:42,560
as good as the person being able to 
enforce it.

2301
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:42,720
Right.
So we need to.

2302
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,040
We need the executive.
Right.

2303
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,250
So that would be an armed guard.
Right?

2304
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:48,330
Right.
So we think about it though.

2305
01:38:48,331 --> 01:38:50,100
We do it at the airport.
Yes.

2306
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:55,230
You know what I'm saying?
We do it at certain nightclubs when I 

2307
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:55,230
go,
I'm not admitting to go into strip clubs

2308
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:56,130
where I am.
When I go to strip club,

2309
01:38:56,131 --> 01:38:57,720
I get patted down.
There's a guard there.

2310
01:38:57,721 --> 01:38:59,520
There's usually three,
three guys there with guns.

2311
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:01,710
I mean,
and I don't.

2312
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:04,730
Besides the people they let in who 
shouldn't have them anyway,

2313
01:39:04,731 --> 01:39:06,450
she just.
There's always going to be cracks.

2314
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:07,150
Right?
Right.

2315
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:12,310
But at at least if you're going to make 
it a gun free zone,

2316
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:16,380
put up the physical preventative 
measures to reinforce that.

2317
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:17,340
You can't just.

2318
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:22,470
A lot of people just don't sticker on 
the window and say this is a gun free 

2319
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:26,001
zone.
The only people who are going to obey 

2320
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:26,001
that or the people you're not even 
worried about anyway.

2321
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:26,340
Well,
the thing about movie theaters,

2322
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:28,860
there's movie theaters don't even say 
this is a gun free zone.

2323
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:33,000
When do they say there's some movie 
theaters?

2324
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:36,330
Is it state to state?
So for instance,

2325
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:39,210
like in Dallas,
right where um,

2326
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,370
there are some movie theaters where I 
can bring my gun in.

2327
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:43,250
No problem.
There are other movie theaters that have

2328
01:39:43,251 --> 01:39:45,660
these signs that say you're not allowed 
to carry a gun in here.

2329
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:47,670
Right?
And so it is state to state.

2330
01:39:47,671 --> 01:39:50,090
Some states they just require you to put
up a sign,

2331
01:39:50,091 --> 01:39:52,980
like it's business to business to it is,
it absolutely is.

2332
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:54,790
So from that perspective,
it's like,

2333
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:59,810
it's like even the courthouse,
right when I go to the courthouse 

2334
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:00,510
courthouse was a gun free zone minus the
fact if you were a cop.

2335
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:02,400
But what do you have to do when you go 
to the courthouse?

2336
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:04,110
You go through metal detectors.
There were cops,

2337
01:40:04,111 --> 01:40:07,560
there were people there with guns.
So what do you do about schools?

2338
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:13,670
Same thing,
but it's like these guys that are 

2339
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:13,670
showing up,
they're not even,

2340
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:14,430
they're not even students to that 
school.

2341
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:18,900
Like Mr Glenn Hug.
Think about it like this though it.

2342
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:22,680
This is where the argument gets really 
disingenuous because it's like,

2343
01:40:22,681 --> 01:40:27,681
oh,
we want to save our kids lives in 

2344
01:40:27,681 --> 01:40:27,681
schools.
Right,

2345
01:40:27,681 --> 01:40:30,300
so the inner cities have more violence 
than we can think of.

2346
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:35,420
Right?
There's tons of shootings that go on 

2347
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:37,310
outside of the schools in their cities.
Was the last time you heard a mass 

2348
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:37,310
shooting in the inner city?
Very,

2349
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:38,370
very rarely.
Very rarely.

2350
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:41,730
If not ever.
What's the one thing that they all have?

2351
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,740
Metal detectors.
Huh?

2352
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:47,460
What's the one thing that Parkland 
didn't have?

2353
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:50,350
Metal detectors.
What's the one thing that a lot of these

2354
01:40:50,351 --> 01:40:53,320
suburban schools that get shot up don't 
have metal detectors?

2355
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:53,620
Well,
you know,

2356
01:40:53,621 --> 01:40:55,000
it's one of the things that they've 
found too,

2357
01:40:55,001 --> 01:40:59,170
is that it's a very strange sort of 
situation,

2358
01:40:59,171 --> 01:41:04,150
but when you deal with places that have 
a lot of violence,

2359
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:08,020
when you deal with places that have gun 
violence and crime,

2360
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:13,470
which you don't have in those places,
is the random mass shootings.

2361
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,480
You have one on one crime,
one arm,

2362
01:41:16,481 --> 01:41:21,481
but the tangible reality of actual gun 
violence for whatever reason,

2363
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:27,840
sort of eliminates these mass shootings.
The mass shootings tend to occur in 

2364
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:30,080
places where people think they're safe.
Yeah,

2365
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,690
right.
Like schools,

2366
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:33,440
movie theaters.
I think there's just,

2367
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:36,580
there's a different dynamic involved.
You know what I mean?

2368
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:41,610
It's um,
it's gonna become more of an unknown 

2369
01:41:41,610 --> 01:41:44,921
because if you compare the violence in 
the inner city to volunteer the suburbs 

2370
01:41:44,921 --> 01:41:45,520
which present themselves and by way of 
mass shootings,

2371
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:51,060
if you compare the numbers as a whole 
mass shootings account for statistics 

2372
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:52,120
for about one to two percent of all gun 
violence,

2373
01:41:52,121 --> 01:41:52,420
right?

2374
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:58,020
And so,
but does exceedingly higher number of 

2375
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:58,730
percentage of gun violence in inner 
cities.

2376
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,150
Right?
And it all really goes back down to what

2377
01:42:01,151 --> 01:42:02,620
I said before,
it's by the economics.

2378
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:07,800
So you have a situation in the suburb,
suburban areas where economically 

2379
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:07,800
speaking,
they're good,

2380
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:07,800
right?
Right.

2381
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,480
So there's not really an incentive to 
just engage in random violence.

2382
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:15,840
You know,
there isn't a narco economy there that 

2383
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:15,970
that feeds on itself,
that requires you to engage in a certain

2384
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:18,910
level of violence in order to survive.
Whereas on the other hand,

2385
01:42:18,911 --> 01:42:20,980
in the inner cities,
you do have that dynamic.

2386
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:23,440
So from that perspective,
what ends up happening though,

2387
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:26,050
even though there was an money,
isn't everything,

2388
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:32,070
money doesn't care it all,
so you're still gonna have instances of 

2389
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:35,401
people who slipped through the cracks 
because money doesn't cure everything 

2390
01:42:35,401 --> 01:42:39,500
and so when it does happen to manifest 
itself in these random acts of mass 

2391
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:39,610
shootings,
right?

2392
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:44,760
Whereas here there isn't.
If I know I'm going to school and I'm 

2393
01:42:46,091 --> 01:42:51,091
going to have to deal with,
I'm going to have to inevitably deal 

2394
01:42:51,091 --> 01:42:51,091
with the violence outside of the school 
anyway.

2395
01:42:51,091 --> 01:42:53,470
It almost,
it almost makes it unnecessary to engage

2396
01:42:53,471 --> 01:42:55,570
in random acts of mass shootings.
It's almost,

2397
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:59,820
it's almost kind of like this perverted 
distraction from,

2398
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:04,940
from wanting to shoot a place up when 
you have to deal with violence on an 

2399
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:05,680
ongoing basis every single day of your 
life.

2400
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:08,050
You know what I mean?
I think that's what their point was.

2401
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,350
The point was that when violence is real
and it's around you all the time.

2402
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:11,910
Yeah,
it's,

2403
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:14,740
it doesn't become this attractive.
Blow up the game.

2404
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:17,980
Why don't you go take a leak and then 
we'll wrap this up and I'll get back.

2405
01:43:17,981 --> 01:43:20,680
Cool.
I'm young.

2406
01:43:20,681 --> 01:43:22,810
James is going to show me his collection
of guns while you're gone.

2407
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:28,530
Carries one in his pants at all times.
Strapped right next to his deck.

2408
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:33,160
Do you think you'd ever carry a gun?
Carry.

2409
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:38,190
Oh,
like what if like what if someone came 

2410
01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:41,191
in here and got us licensed for 
concealed carry and said young Jamie,

2411
01:43:41,441 --> 01:43:46,441
you need to be strapped.
All you have to do is fill out this 

2412
01:43:46,441 --> 01:43:46,441
paperwork and I'm going to make it 
happen,

2413
01:43:46,441 --> 01:43:47,920
man.
I just don't personally feel.

2414
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:48,530
I mean,
I,

2415
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:53,610
I,
I feel like it's also naivety or 

2416
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:53,610
whatever that I don't feel the need

2417
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:53,610
to do it.
Well,

2418
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:55,490
most of the time you wouldn't have the 
need to do it.

2419
01:43:55,570 --> 01:43:56,200
Right?
Right.

2420
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:59,390
The question is,
if you were at a place like,

2421
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,610
you know,
fill in the blank,

2422
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:03,950
whenever one of these things has gone 
down a nightclub,

2423
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:09,220
let's say that gay nightclub in Orlando,
maybe you're curious and you're walking 

2424
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:12,631
around with the theater.
I love about Batman the night it came 

2425
01:44:12,631 --> 01:44:12,631
out.
Yeah.

2426
01:44:12,631 --> 01:44:13,340
How about the Batman one or there wasn't
a one,

2427
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,310
an Amy Schumer movie?
There was,

2428
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:16,890
yeah,
there was a mass shooting,

2429
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:19,350
you know,
I think it was an amy schumer movie,

2430
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:24,490
one of our movies because she became 
like this big anti-gun advocate 

2431
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:25,560
afterwards.
Um,

2432
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:30,540
what do you think that you would ever 
find yourself in a situation where you'd

2433
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,120
want a gun?
I mean,

2434
01:44:32,121 --> 01:44:33,170
after that happened,
I just,

2435
01:44:33,171 --> 01:44:38,171
I was,
I've gone to movies and pictured it 

2436
01:44:38,171 --> 01:44:40,091
happening and I don't know,
you just think about what you would do 

2437
01:44:40,091 --> 01:44:44,170
and I don't know that pulling out a gun 
and firing back is even in my conscious 

2438
01:44:44,391 --> 01:44:44,630
thoughts.

2439
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:49,830
It's definitely in the cards.
If the guy has a gun and he's in the 

2440
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:53,441
room and you see one guy shooting people
and you're there and he's not shot you 

2441
01:44:53,441 --> 01:44:54,680
yet,
it's definitely in the option.

2442
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:55,310
I suppose so,
yeah.

2443
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:56,840
I mean it depends on how long you're in 
there too.

2444
01:44:56,841 --> 01:45:01,841
If it's also whether or not you can keep
your shit together while someone 

2445
01:45:01,841 --> 01:45:01,841
shooting,
you know.

2446
01:45:01,841 --> 01:45:04,650
I mean keeping your shit together while 
while guns are going off and.

2447
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:09,660
But that is.
That is not a normal thing for you and 

2448
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:11,300
the amount of adrenaline will be pumping
through your body.

2449
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:16,450
We're talking about if you were in a 
situation where a mass shooting was 

2450
01:45:16,450 --> 01:45:16,450
going down,
the people that think they can just pull

2451
01:45:16,450 --> 01:45:19,670
out their gun and shoot that person.
You might fucking hit random people.

2452
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:21,830
You might hit the wall.
You might hit the ceiling.

2453
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:23,480
Like,
here's the thing about.

2454
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:28,690
I'll tell you,
I have a lot of experience in archery 

2455
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:32,560
and one of the things that happens with 
people when they're shooting a live 

2456
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:32,560
animals,
they panic.

2457
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:36,590
A big fucking moose walks in and you,
you might hit that moves in the Dick.

2458
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,740
You might not even,
even things as big as a building and you

2459
01:45:39,741 --> 01:45:41,540
might miss it.
Totally.

2460
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:43,190
I mean,
it happens all the time.

2461
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:45,800
Twenty yards away.
People missed the entire animal.

2462
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:50,910
They're just.
And that's something that's not even 

2463
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:53,561
going to fight back.
That's just a Moose for the vegas 

2464
01:45:53,561 --> 01:45:53,561
shooting thing.
I any,

2465
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:54,410
any,
uh,

2466
01:45:54,411 --> 01:45:56,030
witness reports and anything.
It's so hard.

2467
01:45:56,031 --> 01:45:58,370
I feel like anything,
even video reports,

2468
01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:00,980
there's such a chaotic situation.
Sunday night.

2469
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,700
Everybody's wasted.
Yup.

2470
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:03,900
So wasted.
Yup.

2471
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:06,110
What are you going to do?
You have no idea?

2472
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:08,000
Well,
it's also one of those things too,

2473
01:46:08,001 --> 01:46:13,001
whereas it's real problem with the 
conspiracy theories because one of the 

2474
01:46:13,001 --> 01:46:16,241
things that happen out of the Vegas 
situation was people would show up at 

2475
01:46:16,241 --> 01:46:17,750
all these different casinos and say 
someone's shooting.

2476
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:20,270
So they would say were the security.
We go,

2477
01:46:20,271 --> 01:46:22,520
there's an active shooter at circus 
circus.

2478
01:46:22,521 --> 01:46:25,040
There's an active shooter.
So the conspiracy theories were like,

2479
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:26,600
look,
they're shooters everywhere.

2480
01:46:26,601 --> 01:46:31,601
There were shootings everywhere.
I know there was people everywhere that 

2481
01:46:31,601 --> 01:46:34,051
were freaking out because this fucking 
guy was just gunning people down from a 

2482
01:46:34,051 --> 01:46:35,480
hotel room when they haven't learned 
about being a lawyer.

2483
01:46:35,481 --> 01:46:39,020
Eye witness testimony is not reliable.
Eye witness testimony is dog shit,

2484
01:46:39,021 --> 01:46:41,690
man.
I've had people tell me about situations

2485
01:46:41,691 --> 01:46:43,870
where I was there.
I was there.

2486
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:44,300
I'm like,
dude,

2487
01:46:44,301 --> 01:46:49,301
that is not what fucking happened,
and then you have to go over it with 

2488
01:46:49,301 --> 01:46:49,301
them and they're like,
oh yeah,

2489
01:46:49,301 --> 01:46:49,301
maybe you're right.
I will.

2490
01:46:49,301 --> 01:46:54,110
This though.
People stopping mass shootings with 

2491
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:55,260
firearms happens more than people 
realize it does happen,

2492
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:59,670
but it's just what happens is it's very 
disingenuous to deny it happens.

2493
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:05,030
There's a lot of stories out there where
it's happened and people don't know 

2494
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:05,880
about it because they're not.
They're not going to push it.

2495
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:11,000
So you think the elimination of gun free
zones would be the way to protect 

2496
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:12,390
people?
I say,

2497
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:13,170
no,
I'm going to clear it.

2498
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:14,340
I'm.
I'm cleaned up a little bit.

2499
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,880
If you're going to have a gun free zone,
have physical preventative measures in 

2500
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:19,880
order to enrich,
to enforce it.

2501
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:23,100
If you're not going to do that,
eliminate them.

2502
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:25,530
I think they're.
I think first and foremost,

2503
01:47:25,531 --> 01:47:27,150
this will be the first thing that we 
should do.

2504
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:32,390
There should be some sort of a public 
hearing on the use of Ssri 

2505
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:38,420
antidepressants,
psych medications and their 

2506
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:39,940
corresponding instances like the,
the,

2507
01:47:39,941 --> 01:47:44,941
the,
the amount of instances where these 

2508
01:47:44,941 --> 01:47:45,720
shooters are on these things.
I don't think people are aware.

2509
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:48,210
I'll say this much.
To piggyback off what you're saying,

2510
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,360
if I was diagnosed with a mental 
disorder,

2511
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:56,920
I first thing I would do is I would go 
to a bookstore or go online and figure 

2512
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:01,671
out every possible way that I can tell,
help my way through it because I won't 

2513
01:48:01,671 --> 01:48:01,671
touch the stuff.

2514
01:48:01,770 --> 01:48:06,770
Well.
One of the things that's just as 

2515
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:08,211
effective if not more effective.
I think Google this cardio,

2516
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:13,670
I think exercise and running is more 
effective to treat depression than ssrs.

2517
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:16,980
I am almost certain that's that,
that that's the case.

2518
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:18,120
I don't doubt it at all.
I mean,

2519
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:20,520
I think or you think so many people are 
addicted to marathons?

2520
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,420
Yeah.
Oh,

2521
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:23,310
believe me,
I wanted to get high.

2522
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,500
Yeah.
There's something to it,

2523
01:48:25,501 --> 01:48:27,300
man.
I get high when I run for sure.

2524
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:32,330
Is there anything in there?
Every time I go to the official site 

2525
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:33,990
that says it's not a real thing whose 
blood official sense?

2526
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:36,420
CBI Dot.
Where's the NCBI?

2527
01:48:36,530 --> 01:48:41,530
The like where they did a study on it.
Is exercise a viable treatment for 

2528
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:43,230
depression or they want to say no,
get pilled up,

2529
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:48,380
but there.
There are studies that have been done 

2530
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:48,510
that show because I know Rhonda,
Patrick was discussing it.

2531
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:53,100
I have to be freaking.
I hate taking medicine like I have to be

2532
01:48:53,101 --> 01:48:58,101
on the floor before take prescribing 
exercise before medication.

2533
01:48:58,770 --> 01:49:03,770
A real big activity is shown to be 
effective treatment for many forms of 

2534
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:07,011
depression.
So why are so many people still on 

2535
01:49:07,011 --> 01:49:07,011
antidepressants?
Well,

2536
01:49:07,011 --> 01:49:10,371
here's one reason,
and this is not to dismiss the people 

2537
01:49:10,371 --> 01:49:13,551
that are depressed because I know people
that are depressed and it's a horrible 

2538
01:49:13,551 --> 01:49:13,590
thing and I know people that have been 
helped by antidepressants.

2539
01:49:13,591 --> 01:49:15,930
I know people that have my good friend 
Ray.

2540
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:18,600
He was suicidal.
He got on antidepressants.

2541
01:49:18,601 --> 01:49:19,380
He's happiest.
Fuck.

2542
01:49:19,381 --> 01:49:21,510
Now he's off of them.
It helped him.

2543
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,700
My friend Brian,
it was the same thing,

2544
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,500
not the Brian that we know another 
Brian,

2545
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:28,620
he was a Jujitsu guy that I knew.
He had a real fucking problem,

2546
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:31,110
got on Ssri,
turned his life around,

2547
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:34,230
found a good woman,
got got an a great relationship.

2548
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:36,780
It started his own business,
weaned himself off of him.

2549
01:49:36,781 --> 01:49:41,781
Now he's happy.
There's sometimes people find ruts in 

2550
01:49:41,781 --> 01:49:43,410
their life.
We had a podcast with a guy wrote a book

2551
01:49:43,411 --> 01:49:44,820
on it,
a Guy Johann Hari,

2552
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:48,100
who wrote a book on depression,
Ssri for depression,

2553
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:53,100
heart failure patients not so fast.
This study should put to rest the 

2554
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:57,661
practice of starting ssrs and depressed 
patients with heart failure in an 

2555
01:49:57,661 --> 01:49:59,740
attempt to affect cvd outcomes would a 
cvd.

2556
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:01,430
Cardiovascular disease.
Oh,

2557
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:03,220
okay.
Oh,

2558
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:05,530
well that's with people with heart 
problems typically,

2559
01:50:05,531 --> 01:50:10,531
but it's also a depression.
People with depression and heart 

2560
01:50:10,531 --> 01:50:10,990
failure.
Yeah.

2561
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:16,230
Fucking exercise I think is is not.
It's a requirement of the human body.

2562
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:20,710
I really agree with that.
Something even my darkest times,

2563
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:23,610
so I'm never at my.
I'm more.

2564
01:50:23,611 --> 01:50:26,530
I'm never more at my best.
Then actually when I'm down,

2565
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:30,390
when I'm going through things because.
Because my,

2566
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:33,160
my response to it is what it is to 
tighten up.

2567
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:35,180
It forces you to folk.
Exactly.

2568
01:50:35,181 --> 01:50:40,181
Yeah.
And so one of those things that I do is 

2569
01:50:40,181 --> 01:50:43,560
like,
I've been to the gym everyday for the 

2570
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:43,560
last two weeks,
right?

2571
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,800
Um,
it forces me to one of those things that

2572
01:50:44,801 --> 01:50:49,801
happened that one of the things that 
happens is I start working out more 

2573
01:50:49,801 --> 01:50:50,650
because of the clarity of mind I get 
after the fact,

2574
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:53,110
right.
And then the sense of accomplishment and

2575
01:50:53,111 --> 01:50:55,480
then it Kinda starts me off in a way 
where it's like,

2576
01:50:55,481 --> 01:50:56,410
okay,
now what's next?

2577
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:58,840
It's like I'm chasing,
I'm chasing the next thing to conquer.

2578
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,250
Um,
but.

2579
01:51:00,490 --> 01:51:01,090
But yeah,
I,

2580
01:51:01,091 --> 01:51:02,490
I agree with you wholeheartedly.
I think.

2581
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:07,560
I think focusing on focusing on means 
outside of just prescribing pills,

2582
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:12,190
right?
I don't like taking pills.

2583
01:51:12,191 --> 01:51:14,290
I don't like things that alter my mind.
I don't,

2584
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:19,710
I don't like it.
Maybe because I'm a control freak in 

2585
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:22,621
that sense.
I'm the guy with 100 guns is a control 

2586
01:51:22,621 --> 01:51:22,621
freak.

2587
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:27,550
I have something to say about.
It was just thinking about.

2588
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:29,830
I had thought while I was using your 
super toilet,

2589
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:31,690
crazy toilet,
right?

2590
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:33,550
You gotta take a shit.
That's the where to go.

2591
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,680
Um,
I was thinking,

2592
01:51:35,681 --> 01:51:36,090
I was like,
man,

2593
01:51:36,091 --> 01:51:36,950
yeah,
I should get Joe Rogan,

2594
01:51:36,951 --> 01:51:41,951
one of my guns.
And then I realized you can't even 

2595
01:51:41,951 --> 01:51:41,951
notice it here.
I can't.

2596
01:51:41,951 --> 01:51:41,980
Nope.
What can I own?

2597
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,800
What do you have that I can own?
A was the first gun I ever.

2598
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:45,760
The first couldn't.
I've done.

2599
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:49,570
So this one just so happens to be one 
that you can see.

2600
01:51:49,650 --> 01:51:51,360
You have a company that makes him.
Is that what it is?

2601
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:52,090
Yeah,
I have.

2602
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:57,100
Um,
what I did was I came out with a 

2603
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:57,100
signature series,
a line of handguns.

2604
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:02,250
Well,
the first one because it's not allowed 

2605
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:02,250
to California.
What's,

2606
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:02,250
what's wrong with it?
Um,

2607
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,720
y'all have a list of guns that you're 
allowed to own it.

2608
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:07,390
It's not on.
And then like you would have to.

2609
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:12,450
There's this micro stamping that's 
required for any gun that's not on the 

2610
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:12,760
list and it's so prohibitive.
Yeah,

2611
01:52:12,761 --> 01:52:15,230
it's weird.
So what is different,

2612
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:18,010
what kind of guns are they?
What is the other?

2613
01:52:18,910 --> 01:52:21,100
Prohibited the one that you have that I 
can have.

2614
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,540
Oh,
I can have him pull it up.

2615
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:24,640
Sorry if you want.
You mean that particular gun?

2616
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,910
What's about it?
Like what is this Spec state?

2617
01:52:27,911 --> 01:52:32,911
Just it just.
It just is like it's just a list of 

2618
01:52:32,911 --> 01:52:34,630
guns.
I don't really know exactly the caliber,

2619
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:39,950
the semiautomatic capabilities because 
there some automatic guns on the list 

2620
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:40,480
that you're allowed to own.
There are other.

2621
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,670
It was just arbitrary.
That's what it seemed like to me.

2622
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:45,110
What kind of gun is it,
Jamie?

2623
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:45,770
He'll look it up.

2624
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:51,250
If you want to pull it up.
A full up tiered of t y r e d e f e n s 

2625
01:52:52,521 --> 01:52:56,410
e t or defense.com.
Here we go.

2626
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:57,100
Dump,
dump,

2627
01:52:57,110 --> 01:52:57,560
dump,
dump.

2628
01:52:58,720 --> 01:52:59,800
Yeah.
There's some weird shit.

2629
01:52:59,801 --> 01:53:01,630
I mean we've got Jerry Brown's,
our fucking governor.

2630
01:53:01,631 --> 01:53:05,230
That goofball.
Let's see.

2631
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,810
Firearms transfers,
work order,

2632
01:53:07,811 --> 01:53:12,811
phone gallery contact with tier one,
tier one.

2633
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:17,290
It'd be t,
t y r e t y r a.

2634
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,860
There we go.
Bam.

2635
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:21,590
Tyree,

2636
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:35,720
you haven't certainly today coming up 
that people are paying attention to.

2637
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:37,480
Usually it comes up when I'm typing this
stuff,

2638
01:53:37,481 --> 01:53:42,481
so this is why people can't shoot Benton
Lincoln mass shooting.

2639
01:53:43,301 --> 01:53:45,070
Going on pressure.
Actually,

2640
01:53:45,170 --> 01:53:46,780
no.
You see one where it says the advocate.

2641
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:48,280
Yeah,
that's it.

2642
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:50,020
Alright.
What's the name of the gun?

2643
01:53:50,021 --> 01:53:54,090
Is the advocate someone might've been no
service unavailable.

2644
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:54,970
Oh,
the hackers.

2645
01:53:54,971 --> 01:53:57,070
They got to it already.
It's the fucking Russians,

2646
01:53:57,071 --> 01:53:58,240
Bro.
Cassie problems.

2647
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:00,490
Go back and get a pass.
City problems.

2648
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:02,320
I don't know if everyone we've already 
killed it.

2649
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:07,620
Killed it.
He kind of take a couple hundred people 

2650
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:07,620
at it by the,
by the time that it hits youtube though,

2651
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:11,020
isn't it a blender to latest seconds.
Twenty seconds to type in,

2652
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:14,590
type in the advocate and then calling on
the war and then see what that does.

2653
01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:19,130
And in like erase tier defense though.

2654
01:54:22,290 --> 01:54:22,860
Here we go.

2655
01:54:23,770 --> 01:54:27,150
Um,
click on the top 10.

2656
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:28,930
We killed that website.
Go to images.

2657
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,380
Killed that website.
That's the gun.

2658
01:54:32,710 --> 01:54:33,550
Okay.
And why?

2659
01:54:33,551 --> 01:54:36,490
That seems like a normal handgun.
It is.

2660
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:38,710
So what the fuck is wrong with it?
Why can't I have it?

2661
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:43,920
I know.
I want to ask the folks that make 

2662
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,650
leaders in California,
but what are they saying is wrong with 

2663
01:54:46,650 --> 01:54:46,650
it?
Like specifically,

2664
01:54:46,650 --> 01:54:50,791
I don't know why they make the decisions
they make in California to be honest 

2665
01:54:50,791 --> 01:54:50,791
with what.
What is the specs of this gun?

2666
01:54:50,791 --> 01:54:52,360
What it is a nine millimeter handgun,
semiautomatic.

2667
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:55,360
Is it because it's semiautomatic or.
No?

2668
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,130
No,
I don't think so.

2669
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:57,880
No,
no,

2670
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:59,680
just I don't.
I don't think that's the basis.

2671
01:54:59,710 --> 01:55:01,390
Like I don't.
I don't know the,

2672
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:05,740
the complete basis and reasons for why 
certain guns are allowed.

2673
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:09,390
Handgun wines of California and others.
I'm pretty sure they're going to be tons

2674
01:55:09,391 --> 01:55:12,020
of people who tell me this because I 
have a huge audience in California.

2675
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:13,390
I think it's actually my,
one of my biggest audience,

2676
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:15,900
there's a lot of gun owners in 
California.

2677
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:20,950
People people aren't,
you know the idea that guns in 

2678
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:21,490
California or somehow or another rare 
you want.

2679
01:55:21,491 --> 01:55:23,320
The funny thing is the birthplace of 
they are 15,

2680
01:55:23,321 --> 01:55:26,410
wasn't California now?
Well that's a weird gun.

2681
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:28,710
It's a gun that people just have 
demonized.

2682
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:33,720
It's not the most powerful gun.
It's not the scariest gun nut but 

2683
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:39,060
military.
But they don't even use it in the 

2684
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:39,060
military.
They don't use it in the military.

2685
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:39,880
But to be honest with you,
if they did,

2686
01:55:39,881 --> 01:55:40,660
I'd want that gun.

2687
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:44,130
Why?

2688
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:46,650
Because it's the most effective means to
protect myself,

2689
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:47,700
right?
Like I don't.

2690
01:55:47,701 --> 01:55:52,701
I don't understand this idea of 
neutering guns to the point where I'm 

2691
01:55:52,701 --> 01:55:53,780
too new to and get to the point of 
irrelevance or ineffectiveness.

2692
01:55:53,810 --> 01:55:57,630
It's people that don't use guns that 
have this idea,

2693
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,790
and this is.
This is where we're at now.

2694
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:05,300
I think one of the things that I'm 
getting out of this conversation with 

2695
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:06,030
you is that there's not really a clean 
answer.

2696
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:08,430
There's not a clean answer.
And if there was,

2697
01:56:08,431 --> 01:56:12,600
people would have figured it out.
It's almost like society has to continue

2698
01:56:12,601 --> 01:56:16,710
to evolve and one of the ways society 
evolves is having these conversations.

2699
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:19,740
You and I having this conversation where
a few million people are going to listen

2700
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:24,741
to it and then millions of people on 
their own having conversations and 

2701
01:56:24,741 --> 01:56:26,940
people looking at the reality and that's
in that way.

2702
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:31,940
I think what you're doing is important 
and what a lot of people are doing is 

2703
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:36,080
important where they're talking about 
the actual numbers and the actual 

2704
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:36,420
statistics and letting us get a look at 
it,

2705
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:39,210
and that's the one thing that I try to 
convey with my videos.

2706
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:42,240
I don't care where you stand on the 
issue.

2707
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:47,220
I just will have a shit ton of more 
respect for your position if it's from a

2708
01:56:47,221 --> 01:56:51,300
position of education,
if you actually have some knowledge.

2709
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:55,140
I'm not saying you have to be a Jedi.
Master firearms.

2710
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:58,680
Just understand the very basics,
the fundamentals.

2711
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:03,740
We have politicians pushing policy based
on things that make no sense like it.

2712
01:57:03,950 --> 01:57:08,950
It actually exposes the fact that they 
don't know anything about firearms and 

2713
01:57:08,950 --> 01:57:12,741
so it was like you're going to push 
policy on something that you don't know 

2714
01:57:12,741 --> 01:57:15,081
anything about and so it.
It's disingenuous and an inherently 

2715
01:57:15,081 --> 01:57:19,251
dishonest,
so that's the biggest frustration I 

2716
01:57:19,251 --> 01:57:19,251
have.

2717
01:57:19,251 --> 01:57:22,460
I might look it up.
I'm going to educate you and give you 

2718
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:25,011
the information that you need so that 
you can make an informed opinion about 

2719
01:57:25,011 --> 01:57:28,431
it.
If at the end of the day I take you 

2720
01:57:28,431 --> 01:57:30,020
shooting,
I tell you the stats I tell you about 

2721
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:31,350
how guns functioned and how they work.
If you still are anti-gun,

2722
01:57:31,470 --> 01:57:36,470
I can respect that now.
That doesn't mean you get to then push 

2723
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:37,710
your anti gun agenda onto me and limit 
my rights because of it,

2724
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:40,050
but I can respect that.
At least we can walk away and say,

2725
01:57:40,051 --> 01:57:45,051
hey look,
well I think we probably got it from a 

2726
01:57:45,051 --> 01:57:45,051
different perspective.
I appreciate that and I think we're also

2727
01:57:45,051 --> 01:57:47,940
faced with the reality of this.
The sheer number of guns that we have in

2728
01:57:47,941 --> 01:57:49,500
this country.
It's a staggering number,

2729
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:51,490
so you're not going to just take those 
away.

2730
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:52,680
What are you going to put them?

2731
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:55,770
And that's just now there's some people 
were like,

2732
01:57:55,771 --> 01:57:57,660
well,
we can devolve the number over time,

2733
01:57:57,661 --> 01:58:02,661
right?
We can just put these laws and they can 

2734
01:58:02,661 --> 01:58:04,821
get bad for a little bit,
but then overtime doing that weird 

2735
01:58:04,821 --> 01:58:06,340
voice.
When you do wear all the time,

2736
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:11,390
just anti gun,
would you be interested in sitting down 

2737
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:13,380
like maybe on this show if I had an 
antique gun advocate?

2738
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,280
I beg for it.
Okay.

2739
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:16,920
Not,
not to say not,

2740
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:18,780
not reasonable.
Here's the thing.

2741
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:22,700
I'm not trying to get up here in and 
crush this person and,

2742
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,750
and all that stuff.
I've done that to death.

2743
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:28,170
Right.
But I do want to have the conversation,

2744
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:30,210
right.
You and I've done it on my show.

2745
01:58:30,211 --> 01:58:33,030
The only problem is,
is it's too easy to ignore it because of

2746
01:58:33,031 --> 01:58:37,380
the platform that you had someone on 
your show that made reasonable points,

2747
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:40,450
like if somebody wanted to watch you 
with,

2748
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:45,940
uh,
in some sort of a debate with an gun 

2749
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:45,940
person,
is there a show that you could recommend

2750
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:46,960
that people would go watch right now?

2751
01:58:47,010 --> 01:58:47,940
That was on?
Yes.

2752
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:49,510
On your show.
On my show.

2753
01:58:49,570 --> 01:58:50,630
A.
We'll see.

2754
01:58:50,631 --> 01:58:52,960
Here's the thing though.
So the,

2755
01:58:53,290 --> 01:58:58,290
one of the biggest flaws of the people 
that were on my show that we had that 

2756
01:58:58,290 --> 01:59:01,801
conversation with is you could instantly
see it was more of an education process 

2757
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:04,390
because you could tell they didn't know 
much.

2758
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:07,690
So what would happen is that they make a
point about why they believe this.

2759
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:10,480
Then I would give them information and 
then it'd be like,

2760
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:12,040
oh,
okay,

2761
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:13,150
okay.
You see what I'm saying?

2762
01:59:14,490 --> 01:59:19,330
I'm sure there's someone out there that 
is educated and in kids anti-gun.

2763
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:21,040
We'll,
we'll have someone find them.

2764
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:21,820
Well,
I have this.

2765
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:25,090
I have a publicist will have him love 
Matt stags on.

2766
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,890
Please let me know because I'd be all 
for it.

2767
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:28,210
Yeah,
I really would.

2768
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:33,440
There's probably someone out there 
that's reasonable that has good points 

2769
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:35,830
and has a well thought out sound 
argument.

2770
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:38,170
It would be interesting to listen to you
talk to that person.

2771
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:43,230
Absolutely.
But I think one of the things we can 

2772
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:45,151
take away from this is that this is a,
it's a messy situation.

2773
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,830
It's not clean.
It's not like,

2774
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:50,110
hey,
we're putting poison in the water,

2775
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:52,750
stopped putting poison in the water,
clean up the water.

2776
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:55,740
It is not that simple.
It's not super complicated.

2777
01:59:55,741 --> 01:59:57,580
Uh,
deals with mental health.

2778
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:01,120
It deals with freedom and it deals with 
law abiding.

2779
02:00:01,121 --> 02:00:06,121
People aren't doing anything wrong where
people are trying to take away their 

2780
02:00:06,121 --> 02:00:06,121
rights.
They're enthusiasts.

2781
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:08,230
They love guns.
And I don't think there's any like,

2782
02:00:08,231 --> 02:00:09,370
look,
here's a perfect example.

2783
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:12,550
You are sitting here with a gun on your 
shirt.

2784
02:00:12,551 --> 02:00:14,050
What kind of gun is at ar?
15.

2785
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:17,050
You have an ar 15.
Actually selfies I have.

2786
02:00:17,230 --> 02:00:20,020
I have an archery shirt on.
I could walk anywhere with this.

2787
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:21,500
No one would feel threatened.
No,

2788
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:24,000
I'll kill the fuck out of you.
Right?

2789
02:00:24,010 --> 02:00:27,550
But no one would feel threatened.
But if you walk around with that,

2790
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,490
people will,
you know,

2791
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:35,520
you are one of those gun guy.
Are you telling people you have that on 

2792
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:36,490
you?
Is that what you're saying?

2793
02:00:36,491 --> 02:00:38,830
You warning people.
You're a dangerous person,

2794
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:39,580
you know?
Oh,

2795
02:00:39,581 --> 02:00:41,230
you're an archery enthusiasts.
Oh,

2796
02:00:41,231 --> 02:00:43,750
so I did archery at camp.
When I was in the boy scouts,

2797
02:00:43,751 --> 02:00:48,751
we shot bows.
I'm going to start opening girls at the 

2798
02:00:48,751 --> 02:00:48,751
bar with that.
Yeah,

2799
02:00:48,751 --> 02:00:50,280
I shoot archery.
A bad movie,

2800
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:51,970
man.
It's not a bad move.

2801
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:54,280
So listen,
I appreciate the conversation.

2802
02:00:54,281 --> 02:00:56,650
I don't think we got anywhere,
but I don't think you can.

2803
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,700
I think we talked about it.
I mean,

2804
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,760
to be honest with you,
it's a conversation that needs.

2805
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:02,920
So here's what happens.
Things happen in our,

2806
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:07,000
in our reality that forced a specific 
focus on the part of the conversation.

2807
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:08,020
Right?
And so,

2808
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:09,620
um,
of course we weren't going to say,

2809
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:10,870
I don't know how long we been here,
how long we've been.

2810
02:01:10,910 --> 02:01:11,890
Two hours,
two hours,

2811
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:16,980
right?
We've been having this gun debate for 

2812
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:17,590
how long now in this country for years.
Um,

2813
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:20,800
but I think for a lot of people,
especially the people who follow me,

2814
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:23,530
they wanted me to come on your show,
not because you and I were going to come

2815
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:25,960
to an answer,
but to educate,

2816
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:31,230
right?
Well also to have what we have on the 

2817
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:32,020
show where I try to have on the show 
just discussions,

2818
02:01:32,021 --> 02:01:33,130
just talk.
Exactly.

2819
02:01:33,610 --> 02:01:36,130
And let people talk.
Let people express themselves.

2820
02:01:36,131 --> 02:01:37,600
And I think you definitely did that 
today.

2821
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:40,070
You Express yourself,
you're very reasonable guy.

2822
02:01:40,071 --> 02:01:42,530
Anybody looks at you and says you're a 
maniacal gun nut.

2823
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:45,260
You pulling that out of your own head,
you know,

2824
02:01:45,261 --> 02:01:50,261
um,
but I would love to do that and we'll 

2825
02:01:50,261 --> 02:01:50,261
try to find somebody will try to find 
somebody if you're open to that.

2826
02:01:50,261 --> 02:01:51,770
Absolutely.
Trying to find somebody that could,

2827
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:53,600
could argue the point,
but thank you brother.

2828
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:55,400
Thanks for having.
Great pleasure.

2829
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:57,980
All right folks.
We'll be back very shortly.

2830
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:02,090
We have a second round two today with 
Sam Harris and Majid Nawaz.

2831
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:04,310
See you soon.
That was great.

2832
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:05,250
That was fun.
