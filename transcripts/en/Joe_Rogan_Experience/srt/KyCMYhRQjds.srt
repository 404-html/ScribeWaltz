1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,090
Experience.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,950
Nicholas, me, boy, Joey, boy.

3
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,580
We've known each other for many decades
and now we're both wear reading glasses.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,700
Look at this ladies and gentlemen,
fucking irritate fucking old men.

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,330
We can't see up close. So sad.
Did you notice when you came in?

6
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:30,700
I ripped mine off like you were abroad.
It's like one of those things.

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,620
If someone calls,
you know and you're sleeping,

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,320
you always lie about it and it's like,
what do you need those nod to him?

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,330
Don't need those. I only use those
for numbers. I'm in the restaurant.

10
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,590
I have to wait,
just hold on the menu.

11
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:46,070
She's 11 and 11 feet from my
table so I can read. Yeah,

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,240
in low light conditions and less.
I have my camera on my,

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,160
my phone with the flashlight, you know, so
I can use, I could read it if I have my,

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,410
but otherwise I don't know
what the fuck at the bill is.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,880
You need to step up the bifocals so you
can wear them all day long and I'll be

16
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:03,030
going, I don't need them past like
my arm's length. It's, that's right.

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,810
My friend Steve Graham explained it to me.
He's an ophthalmologist.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,580
I guess when you get older, your, your,

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,240
your eyes just lose their ability to
focus up close and then this shit doesn't

20
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:13,560
help.
Computers don't know.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,380
It's the worst pawn on your cell
phone at three in the morning.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,680
That's not what I'm talking
about. I'm talking about
work. I don't know a year. No,

23
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,170
no. You're talking Nick
Depaulo. How dare you.

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,460
Apparently you're doing a lot more than
I am. Joe. Uh, you went back to New York,

25
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,090
Huh? Yeah. How long ago did you go
back? I was out here. Oh, Christ.

26
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,280
I was out here from 95 to 99.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,560
And you were like enough for think
Chris rock called. Yeah, I had it not,

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,350
I swear to God,
this is a true story.

29
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:41,340
I was in my own shower at my house arguing
with an imaginary fucking age and I

30
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:43,470
didn't have,
I'm not fine.

31
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,460
I swear to God my wife heard
me in this house, be right,

32
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,400
did and I'm like,
I'm fucking losing my mind out here.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,210
And then like a bolt from God.
Chris rock called.

34
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:58,230
He started his HBO show and said,
I want you to be one of the writers,

35
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,850
and I was like,
you gotta be shitting me.

36
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,990
I was on the fucking next plane out
looking, looking down at all the bridges.

37
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,030
I burned in La.
You could see the fires from

38
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,000
nick played my brother on news
radio. There was a, there was a,

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,630
I want to say it was a confusion,
but it would be a lie.

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,070
It was an agent tried to fuck him.
A casting agent tried to fuck them over.

41
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,210
We had already booked him for the part
and all the sudden this casting agent

42
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,450
goes, oh, I've already booked that.
I've got this guy coming in and I go,

43
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:32,730
what are you talking about?
I go, it's supposed to be
Nick Depaulo. He's my friend.

44
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,370
He's going to be my brother. My other
friend Brian counts, my other brother.

45
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,040
It's already booked. She goes,
well, I don't know what to do.

46
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,650
You know I've already got this guy books,
so you're going to have to tell nick.

47
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,940
Oh No, no, no.

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,420
I get near this to tell this fucking
other guy because she had already called

49
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:48,510
you and told you you didn't. That's
right. She came out and said, uh,

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,860
you guys can go whatever.

51
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,070
She tried to weasel casting female
casting agents in many circumstances are a

52
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:59,590
lot like male casting agents.
You know the casting couch,

53
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,730
the notorious casting couch. Yes. How
bad you want it. The part and you know,

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,490
well this,

55
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,530
this gal had a male friends
and these male friends, uh,

56
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:15,740
apparently, uh, she, she enjoyed
their company and so she would, uh,

57
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,700
get them gigs even if those
gigs weren't really available.

58
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,840
And that was what was going on. And she
was just going to weasel this guy. Yeah.

59
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,230
Yeah. And I was walking to my car and you
came running out and go, hey, hey, hey.

60
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:30,040
I go, what? And then I felt bad. I'm
like, now did I just fuck somebody over?

61
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,350
Cause I know Joe. No you didn't
fuck anybody. You were already,

62
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:37,900
that was a stellar after
you were outstanding, but
you were approved and done.

63
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,240
It was over. But she just tried to
weasel it in. It was fucking gross. Oh,

64
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,650
oh, it was that Horace name. Oh, no need.

65
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:50,170
No need to name names and who it might
not. She might have been on medication.

66
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,071
Who knows what the fuck.

67
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,380
That was a fun episode that we beat
the shit out of each other through each

68
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:56,860
other through windows three
Stojich and we did a scene,

69
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,500
we actually did a scene that it said was,

70
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,580
it came across to violent Joe and
Brian at it. Remember what the coffee,

71
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:07,020
we had a glass coffee pot or I hit you
over the head and smashed me over the

72
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:10,810
head and then we kick and jellies
down and they said it looked too much.

73
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,740
They actually said it looked too much
like Goodfellas. Dinero was kicking a guy.

74
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,150
Remember he had the, so uh, it was it
last week. I got to break this thing off.

75
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:22,420
He had like five times. Yeah. I got to
fly through a glass window. You know,

76
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:26,310
they have that candy glass. So I went
flying through a window. It was fun, man.

77
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,010
That was a fun episode. And you know
who Epstein from from welcome back.

78
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:31,570
Kotter Epstein from welcome back.

79
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,330
Kotter was our oldest brother who was a
priest that we were all terrified of his,

80
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,430
I think he's dead too, isn't he? Did he
pass away? No. Kiddin what was his name?

81
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,840
He's got a Dutch team from welcome back.
Guys are going to be born then. Yeah.

82
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,480
Um, I didn't know he died. Did he really
die either? Either that or I'm stunning,

83
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,460
ugly grow right now, but I, I,

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,300
I realize this might have jack died
now you will hope in horse shit.

85
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,940
Don't confuse your hopes that you
went, oh wait a minute. You know what?

86
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,330
You're right. Is it, is it
Horshack he and the Black Guy,

87
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:08,200
I think they're all bad actually Gabe,
cause you know who else died?

88
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,980
The wife died. Oh, he died in
2000 wife died. You were right.

89
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:14,350
He died in 2012 he did.
You know,

90
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,400
maybe he's from that episode was
a lot of violence going. Wow.

91
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,300
He looked like shit before he died. What
the fuck, man, when we knew that's him,

92
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:26,140
that's him. That's Robert Hedges. When we
knew him, he actually looked pretty good.

93
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,780
It looks like a candy Crowley from CNN.

94
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,300
Some of those guys that get a really
good gig like a welcome back Connor.

95
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,800
And then after that it dies.
Those fucking guys never recover.

96
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,510
It's like they're living the
fucking life there. Yeah.

97
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,770
Nice bagels from craft service. Everybody.
Good Morning Mr Hedges. How are you sir?

98
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,030
Get your coffee. Would you
like something? And then uh,

99
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,990
this fucking cruel machine just
spits them out. It's a hard fun.

100
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,360
And then you want home. I, yeah.

101
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,660
When did he turn into a
Hawaiian woman before he died?

102
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,110
What the fuck? Who Does he look early
from? Loss. You know what happened?

103
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:07,040
He probably went all spiritual. Look at
all the necklaces and stuff he's wearing.

104
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,540
You probably went all spiritual.

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,440
Probably it was all going downhill
or maybe he had cancer or something.

106
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,460
Maybe now I feel bad. He
was a dude, man. He was,

107
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,880
and he knew that that was like a thrill
to meet the guy died of a heart. Yeah,

108
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:24,590
it was. We were kids when that show was,
you died of a heart attack, 60 years old.

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,560
And I think I know the woman,
the wife,

110
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,960
the played the wife and that
showed just died of cancer.

111
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,360
Well I'm the Cape Chaplain's wife
on the show. She just died recently.

112
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,770
Meanwhile, John Travolta looking great,
sucking cock all over the planet.

113
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,720
Apparently it's how you get rhythmic.

114
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,030
Well he definitely doesn't
look ripped anymore. No,
you're right. He's Kinda Kinda,

115
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,960
yeah. Who looks the best from that? Well
him, he looks the best from that show.

116
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,610
I want the black guy that
played Washington cause he's
still around. Freddy. Boom,

117
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:58,990
boom. Washington. Yes. Hills.
We are dating ourselves,

118
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,000
but it's relevant because they're
dead and we're getting close to it.

119
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,890
Nobody knows who they are anymore.
That's what's fucked up. No, I know.

120
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,040
Let's talk about, let's find the guy,
if they just did a loss, reference it.

121
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,460
I've never seen the show
you never saw last. No.

122
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,620
This is the first network gave
a really good, I rewatched it.

123
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:19,670
Joe's way better if you know what happened
because now you're only focusing on

124
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:21,620
what you're really
supposed to be focusing on.

125
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,290
Not The bullshit that
makes you hate this show.

126
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,310
But here's that picture of Freddy. Boom,
boom, Freddy, boom. Is he still alive?

127
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,620
Lawrence Hilton. Jacobs is his name.
Yeah, it looks good. Yeah. He's,

128
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,740
he's the best looking guy at all
of them now. And Horshack checkout.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,700
I think you're right. He seemed
shocked is done. I think you're right.

130
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,040
I think horse sharks debt.

131
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,430
Let's say that shows kind of Jenks
now the you'd think of not really.

132
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,130
It's just life. Well, they're
not that. Hello. It's just
what's true, which is like,

133
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,210
yeah, he died in 2012, two same
year that, uh, Epstein died.

134
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,160
And Gabe cod, who's a like degenerate
gambler. Is he a degenerate? Well,

135
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,450
that's what I heard. I know he's a poker
player and maybe I'm stretching the,

136
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,370
those two are kind of synonymous. Club
owner told me that. Did you ever do that?

137
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,510
Kj Rentals in Orland Park, Illinois, a
guy named Kenny round? No, never does.

138
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,060
He used to have Gabe
cod are in there and uh,

139
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,130
gave copies to hate going to bring this
stuff to the airport and our luggage and

140
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,760
had hate to check it. He used to mail
it, spend like three, $300 a mailing.

141
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:29,080
It's closed really.
And he went and he,

142
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,150
this guy took him out
gambling and some casino. Um,

143
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:36,230
he was there the weekend before I was
any, any, uh, he won. Like he won,

144
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:39,920
like he said, 750,000 betting
on football. And I said,

145
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,390
you mean 75 that he goes, no, 750,000.
This guy, Kenny wouldn't lie either.

146
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,960
Uh, but he, this guy, he was
like, he's like a heavy intuit.

147
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,780
When you start getting
to those big numbers,

148
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:55,290
that's fucking dangerous because
it can all go away like that. Well,

149
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,100
I'm going to pool,

150
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,550
I put $5 on the beginning of the year
and I'm trying to beat my niece, Jenna.

151
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,200
That's helping. That's helping.
I mean, is it gambling is fun,

152
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,590
don't get me wrong.
But the thing about gambling is that like,

153
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:12,210
you got to keep pushing the stakes to
keep up in that thrill, to try juicing.

154
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:15,390
Your veins are already lang used to,

155
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,610
he used to go hard and oh my God,

156
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,040
he told me some of the num and in a
norm norm is the worst, right norm.

157
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,370
Norm Macdonald's supposed to be like
the worst of all time. Oh my God.

158
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,420
It's like again so bad.
I couldn't get on his podcast this week.

159
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,270
What kind of numbers?

160
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,860
Well I already told me story about norm
and he says it's absolutely true that he

161
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:42,480
won. He won like 60 grand one
night and he walked out. Uh,

162
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,560
where would they gambling? What the hell
was it? It wasn't Vegas cause it was,

163
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,730
there was an ocean nearby.

164
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:50,250
Any throw all the money in the ocean
cause he knew he was going to Piss it away

165
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:54,720
anyways. Why? That's yeah, that's
what I already told me. I wouldn't,

166
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,880
I wouldn't doubt that. I
wouldn't need that. You know,

167
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,940
norm telling my legit crazy.

168
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,980
We were,

169
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,210
we were having a great time on a plane
once and just randomly sat next to each

170
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,910
other. It's just total dumb
luck. Had a great time.

171
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,560
Lino three hour flight
laughing and cracking up and
talking to all kinds of shit.

172
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,370
He's like, wow. Yeah. I quit smoking
a long time ago. I'm just so happy.

173
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:22,230
I quit smoking and then as he lands,
he goes, spa, I want a cigarette.

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,100
He walked right into the fucking, one
of those duty free shops at the airport,

175
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,730
bought cigarettes and it just
couldn't have them in his hand.

176
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,530
As he was walking out the
door and lighting them,

177
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,880
couldn't wait to get out
the door to light him. I go,

178
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:36,270
what happened to Quintin
cigarettes? He goes, I quit Quintin.

179
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,000
I just wanted a cigarette.
It was so great.

180
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:46,050
I mean, just an hour ago talking about
how much he's happy. He quit cigarettes.

181
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:50,340
He quit a long time ago and then this
switch goes off and he just impulsively

182
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:53,790
decides time to have a cigarette.
I go to his hotel and he's in New York.

183
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:57,150
A few years ago,
I had a bunch of sets at night.

184
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,160
It's like two in the morning and he
tells me to come up to his hotel.

185
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,100
He's drinking black coffee by the pot.
He drank.

186
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:05,940
Like I took pots in front of me and I can
hear her stomach gargling cause he had,

187
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,590
he had some stomach problems he says,

188
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,600
and I can hear him make any songs
and he's just too full pots and I go,

189
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,290
what?
He didn't do stay up for three day night.

190
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,580
I'm immune to it and it
doesn't even bother me, Eh.

191
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,690
Some guys can just drink coffee like Tate
Tate and drink coffee and go to sleep.

192
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:24,610
My friend who owns caveman coffee,
people become immune to this year.

193
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,530
He drinks coffee and then you can pass
out. I don't, I'm like a little puss.

194
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,290
I have a half a cup but I'm all over
the place like a fucking meth addict.

195
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,360
It's one of those things
if you do it a lot,

196
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,540
if you drink a lot of coffee it
sort of becomes normal. But if you,

197
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,930
if you take a few months off a coffee
and then you realize what a drug caffeine

198
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:43,920
really is. I actually have a bit
on my album. It was a good segue.

199
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:48,300
I knew one nick dip. Yeah, Nick Dip
Com. You can get it. By the way.

200
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,220
What's the name of the [inaudible]?
Another senseless killing.

201
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:51,420
Another senseless killing.
But uh,

202
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:54,220
I have a caffeine bid on
there because I'm like hyper.

203
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,660
I get fucking like, I'm also
allergic to it. You're what?

204
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,900
I'm almost like allergic to it. If I have
most alert, I have a couple of cups. No,

205
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,400
I, I can't even like focus. Really? Yeah.
So it's an unusual feeling that you get.

206
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,400
Yeah. I don't, uh, has this
always been the case? No. No.

207
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,630
This is a recent, yeah, it's
like the eyes. Yeah. Oh yeah.
It's deliver. No, it is Joe.

208
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,520
The immune system can't even fight
out of caffeine. Now we're going,

209
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,080
we're going like fucking Horshack.

210
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,700
We can we play that enough caffeine
clap. Yeah. Yeah. Here, let's play it.

211
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,550
Caffeine.
Here we go.

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,670
That's a great setup. Negative guy. Have
a caffeine problem. Just found that out.

213
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,010
I like, I mean, I'm
almost allergic caffeine.

214
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:40,270
I was laying in bed the
other night thinking,

215
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:43,030
how come I've been in like 12 fist
fights before noon time over the last 20

216
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:47,210
years.
I'm like hyper alert.

217
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,780
You guys have a couple cups of coffee,
you get a little jittery.

218
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:51,040
It's like bath salts for me.

219
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,960
I'll show you fucking face off
and leave you in the street.

220
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,120
I go to Dunkin donuts. An hour later
I'm naked in my driveway. Restaurant.

221
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,890
Three cops. Tasering my balls.
What's he on? Angel Dust. No,

222
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,080
I had a Cappuccino with three sugars.
Get back in your car.

223
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,030
I'll fucking true your nose,

224
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,410
but I get really nasty as
opposed to by natural state.

225
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,710
I've had some of the worst fight to
my wife and I was jacked up on coffee.

226
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,550
Last January. True Story. It's a Sunday
morning. My wife comes down the stairs.

227
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,710
She goes, uh, my nieces and
nephews are coming over.

228
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:27,460
We're going to a petting zoo and
you're coming with us and I'm like,

229
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:31,000
I've been following the Patriots for 16
weeks. Today's the first playoff game.

230
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,670
But yeah. What better time to
look? Got a gold Lang is on shit.

231
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,783
Was it an accident?

232
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,510
Cut to me were like half hour later
I'm in a bar and looking at animals.

233
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,460
I have like a pot of coffee and my gut.
I'm crawling out of my skin.

234
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,780
This guy next to me goes to me the most
condescending. Tony goes, that's a Yak.

235
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,551
I go,
yeah,

236
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:57,060
I know what to fucking act as a sign but
on the cage and it had a read asshole

237
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,360
and then I realized he was talking to his
four year old son on the other side of

238
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:05,090
it.
Is that not a classic caffeine?

239
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,190
How do you get out of that one?
I just stayed in the asshole role,

240
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,990
went till the next cage and it was a goat
in there. I just looked at him. I went,

241
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,580
let me guess duck. What is that?
A pigeon come on Doctor Sushi.

242
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:19,240
No fucking everything.
What does that right.

243
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,090
Even as a little kid was
looking up at me like,

244
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:27,240
who pissed in your cheerios mister? And
I'm like, fuck you, you little pussy.

245
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:31,340
I for a Pumpkin at him. My wife pushed
me out of the bag. What'd you record

246
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,160
this? Keep? There's what? Go ahead.
There's one more. One more caffeine story.

247
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:36,530
This was about a month and a half later,

248
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,560
White Plains airport sit next to this
obese guy for like two hours ignoring his

249
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:44,910
smell. He hadn't said a word to each
other. All of a sudden he gets up,

250
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:47,400
he looks at me and this tone of voice,
he goes, I'm going to the shitter.

251
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:48,360
Watch my bag.

252
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,740
That's totally am I caught on. I get
bags are not gonna explode in 30 seconds.

253
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,530
He goes, well, look like a terrorist.
I go, that depends. He goes,

254
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:59,660
depends on where to go.
If I was a cheeseburger,

255
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,000
I was a fresh garden salad.

256
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:08,120
I feel very comfortable watching your
bags in the next 20 minutes or a pack of

257
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:12,290
sweet low, but you're like butter.
Let's be honest, and that's it.

258
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,920
I did that at acme. Oh yeah, that's
a great club. My favorite club,

259
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,060
it's a great club.
It's a low ceiling and it's,

260
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,070
I say, I think it was
like 270 people. Yeah,

261
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,100
there's like five of those type of
clubs like helium, comedy works,

262
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:33,700
you know all those like low
ceiling, tight, tight clubs.

263
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,770
Joe is his Denver like that. I haven't
been in the comedy works in you. God.

264
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:41,620
It's the best I know. I get kicked out of
the rap to, to some Bachelorette party,

265
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:42,700
ruin my fucking shell.

266
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,480
The second time I was there and I called
him fat conch and the girl who ran the

267
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:48,670
place was of that gun. So she
didn't like that. Oh, how dare you.

268
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,270
I hope you still not running it.
She, of course she owns it now. Well,

269
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:56,880
I don't think it was
Wendy. Really? How long?

270
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,290
Just had to be 18 years ago.
Oh, it was probably one day
a rally. She's on morning.

271
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,130
I apologize. She couldn't have been
on it and get then. All right. Yeah.

272
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,260
She owned it from the start.
Oh. Cause she wasn't there.

273
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,140
Now the owners are never even
on their charge back then.

274
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,520
And then she got like Tommy things
done and while she stapled Yam,

275
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,720
she went with the, you know, they
do those things well, it's no need.

276
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,210
It's still no reason to let a
bad truck party ruin my shot.

277
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,890
I hear yelling with you. That's
what you did yours, right?
Yeah, yeah. Killer. Right.

278
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:30,670
I love that place. Yeah. It did my uh,
rocky mountain high or the last one,

279
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:34,060
my comedy central special. I decided
I'm doing them all from now on in clubs.

280
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,660
Yeah. I I did, uh, the last one I did,

281
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:41,050
Ron nerve was in at
comics w which is a club,

282
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:45,730
but it was like we squeezed like 500
people in there and um, you know,

283
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:49,420
people do these big theaters and they
start to all sound alike or like kind of

284
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:51,190
cookie cutter.
You don't capture that,

285
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:55,660
that energy that I think you could
get away with a theater. I mean, uh,

286
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,870
I did a talk in monkey's in space.
My next set,

287
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:01,120
my second favorite one that
was in a theater in Columbus.

288
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,550
Nice little theater though. I like a
900 seats. Oh, that's perfect. Yeah.

289
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,450
But I think the, once you go
to like 2000, 3000, it's you,

290
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,740
you lose a bit of the interaction with
the crowd. Yeah. There you are. An acme.

291
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,670
That's a fucking club. That's a great
club. Those classic low ceiling clubs.

292
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,670
That's,
that's why your comedy is hypnotic.

293
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:25,300
Like everyone gets roped
into your energy mindset.

294
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,810
Energy stays right in your face.
You do ride it and they write it.

295
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,860
And it's also like, I feel
like, um, when you're, you, you,

296
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,770
you don't miss any of the tags. You
don't miss any of the, I didn't,

297
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:40,030
have you ever sat in the
crowd at a theater before? Uh,

298
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,940
just to add a Letterman tape and
when I first moved to New York, yeah.

299
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:46,660
But that's different, right?
Because that's like not a
standard. No, I went to a,

300
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:49,740
I was in New Jersey and Joey
and I, Joey Diaz and I, we're,

301
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:53,280
we're doing Friday night and a Lewis
Black was there on Thursday night.

302
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,340
So we had gotten there early. We flew in,
we said, well, let's go say hi to Louis.

303
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,503
We'll sit in the audience.

304
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,990
So we went and sat in the audience and
he would get a big laugh and then he

305
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:04,950
would have a tag line. Nobody couldn't
hear the tagline. And I was like, oh,

306
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,410
you can't hear out here
because everyone's laughing.

307
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,910
There was too many people like around
you that were laughing and the sound just

308
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:16,320
didn't penetrate to that.
How big that was that then 22 lines,

309
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,820
2,400 something like that.

310
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,180
I'll never get any of that
unfortunately know it's a little larger.

311
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,200
That's my goal to make a bad specialty
in front of 2100 people. Actually,

312
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,400
I would love to be able
to fill 2100 seats.

313
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,210
I don't give a shit how
the special came out,

314
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,330
but when you do get a big laugh
and like 3000 people to wait,

315
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,670
what's the biggest crowd
you've ever performed for? Um,

316
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,570
radio city, I think, but
the dentist Larry was a,

317
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,640
I want to say 7,060 500 or so.
Oh.

318
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,630
Then we did some of the staples center.
That's where it was.

319
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,680
Staples San was even bigger.

320
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:57,340
It was like 7,000 I think out here in
la I did a Kevin and being have this a

321
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,230
April fool's day thing,
the April fools weekend,

322
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:03,790
and it's a 7,000 that was
the biggest I've ever done.

323
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,950
It's weird because it's had some theater
at universal and they're all in front

324
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:09,360
of you.
It's like a wall of people.

325
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,190
It's like a real steep incline so that
like the top row is like right in front

326
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:17,060
of you. Like everyone's right in front
of, it's a very strange theater, but it's,

327
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,020
that makes it intimate. Yeah, it's great
for 7,000 people. It's as good as it gets.

328
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,310
The, I did want to Seneca
Casino, uh, this past October,

329
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:30,180
I think it was like 550 seats,
but same thing, theater seating.

330
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,600
And if I have a shot, something
else, I'd love to do it there.

331
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,430
Those casinos can be fucking weird.
Like you can suck or they can be great.

332
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,340
That was a great one. But they,
they hit a mess. You're right.

333
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,550
Those Indian ones in
Connecticut. Oh, fucking Christ.

334
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,050
You don't know what you're getting.
Especially the people like Connecticut.

335
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:51,120
Connecticut is a fucking strange.

336
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,530
You got people around the edges
that are near Boston or the,

337
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,590
that are not in New York that are cool,
but they're like Kinda like, yeah,

338
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,780
I didn't want to live in the
city. I like, I want a yard.

339
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,130
So they'd go to Connecticut and then
you've got those fucking deep Weirdos that

340
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:07,200
live in those point where you
have to drive five miles an hour,

341
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:10,320
cause deer jumping across the road
every five seconds. Yeah, yeah.

342
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:13,100
You got an urban met, you've got hard
for it, and then you get a, yeah,

343
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,530
the woods and then you get the snowdy
people in Greenwich and Hartford.

344
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:22,080
Surprisingly shitty. I know you
think of Hartford, Connecticut.

345
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:26,370
It sounds regal, like
Hartford, Connecticut probably
was at one time. Yeah,

346
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:30,780
it's Waterbury. Connecticut. Yeah.
We used to be like a textile.

347
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,830
It was unbelievable. Back in the
fifties it was a beautiful city.

348
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,460
Now you know,
you know,

349
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,350
I used to do gigs in Waterbury and get
a bowl of driving through them. Yeah.

350
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,230
It's a rough area.
There's a lot of rough spots there.

351
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,010
My wife's from outside of Waterbury.
Yeah. I think the best place to stop.

352
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,570
She's a witch doc that I
mentioned that. No, no.

353
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,670
She's from a little town from outside
of Waterbury, but I mean it's,

354
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,920
don't get me wrong. Some nice
people there, but they're all dying.

355
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,440
Get Out. Cause I don't like seeing,
I don't like to Mexico. See,

356
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:02,960
I don't want eat VA. I don't
like, I guess if you're a Gambler,

357
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,320
I can see love and stay in
there for a week, but, but
I hate when I have to do it.

358
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:11,030
Casino. I just don't, it it, it, to
me, it draws the fucking dregs of the,

359
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,690
he said he's people like during the late
seventies you're wearing dirty running

360
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,950
shoes at a members only jacket
on a Friday night, you know,

361
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,760
and you think you're lucky.
The fuck makes you think you're lucky.

362
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,990
You're wearing dirty running shoes and
a maps only jacket and you just put two

363
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:29,480
grand into the wheel of fortune machine.
You fucking loser.

364
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,850
And then they get pissed and
they come to the show, right.

365
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,020
Sit with that puts on their face.
Well,

366
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,580
especially those casinos feel like you
are only here because you're a gambling

367
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:40,970
junkie. You're not taking a weekend
in Vegas. I'm going to go to Vegas.

368
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,910
We're going to see some shows now.
We're going to go to the stratosphere.

369
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:48,200
We're going to ride the rides. Ooh,
no, none of that. Fucking Connecticut.

370
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,870
And then you play in the craps table,
the guy next,

371
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:56,870
she is like a 20 year old kid wearing a
Nick's shirt. He's a basketball shirt,

372
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,330
like you know,
fucking and work boats.

373
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,330
What do you think you to dress up like
back in the rat pack days? Not Dress up,

374
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:06,560
but what the fuck? You don't have
to look like crap. The collar.

375
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,280
A little collar on your shirt. I'm not
saying that, but a little alligator.

376
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,190
I have no shirts. I hate
them. Do you remember when
we were kids? Kids would, uh,

377
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,720
they would so fake
alligators on like generic.

378
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,680
Well the kids in south he with
like the poor kids, right? Yeah.

379
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:24,540
And you get mad at you if
you want to check their tag,

380
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,470
it doesn't have it notorious. B
I g has a song about that. Right.

381
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,880
It doesn't check in your tag. Yeah.
Like someone's trying to, and like,

382
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:34,120
you punched him in the face like,
yeah. There's like a song where he's,

383
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,100
he punches somebody in the face where
they try to check his tag because a reason

384
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:40,920
for violence. Look, he's
questioning your brand.

385
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,410
You've got to do what you gotta do.
If you're in certain neighborhoods,

386
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,090
you know you've got to keep your Rep.

387
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,750
The fake ones always look
just like the alligator,

388
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:52,370
but it's just like a tadpole or a lizard
or something. Yeah, it's a little off.

389
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,210
Yeah.
Can never,

390
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,210
you have to have nothing on your shirt
or is it a weird how fucking brands

391
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:00,670
become like something
that everyone has to have?

392
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:04,660
It's so fucking strange how sheepish
people are with that kind of stuff.

393
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,310
Sheep like, Eh, I need to wear
what everybody else is wearing.

394
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,380
Otherwise you're not in,
you know, like brand.

395
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,180
I know people that they want
to have everything brand name,

396
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,610
you know,
like everything has to be brand name.

397
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,880
And if it's not brand name like well
it's just as good. It doesn't matter.

398
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,800
You know,
my wife you talking about

399
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,200
bye fucking generic. I do a bit
about, we have mice in our basement,

400
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:32,760
so I put traps down. She can't I, I caught
a put an imported Parmigiano Reggiano,

401
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:35,910
cheese and one of the fucking
tracks at 18 bucks a pound.

402
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:40,830
Really about Kraft singles. What the
fuck she was putting imported cheese.

403
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,850
She just wanted, you know, click cheese.
Yeah. That's all we had in the fridge.

404
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,700
And I'm like, oh, what are you fucking,

405
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,300
you know when he Lima Biscardi don
and I fucking an espresso maker.

406
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,670
It's one of my older bits.
But so what? It's true.

407
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,140
Somebody has a good joke about piscotty.
No, no. Uh, no. Pastry is good.

408
00:23:57,141 --> 00:24:00,440
If you have to dunk it in
coffee first ESOP, nobody eats.

409
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,560
But Scotty raw

410
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,050
cuts the underside of your mouth.
Oh, Sarah wine shake has one.

411
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,160
She has a Scottie bit. Yeah.
It's not her, it's a guy. I know.

412
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,460
It's a guy who has the bit,
but yeah, I mean it's one of
those things. It was like,

413
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,530
well, I'm like, when
you go to a fucking, uh,

414
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,580
like I'm one of those
coffee beans and they have,

415
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,640
what are those hard like triangle looking?
It's not a,

416
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:29,910
it's a blueberry Scott Stone.
Fuck's going on.

417
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,790
I want a muffin. And all you have is
scones. Bullshit. Fuck scones. Lemon bars.

418
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,040
Not Bad.
I disagree with you there.

419
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,730
I don't mind the lemon bars.
I just,

420
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,550
I just feel like pastry
should be mostly soft.

421
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,000
I don't mind a little crusty outside
and he looked like you did coke right?

422
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,940
Updated a little ticket,
dessert powder all over your face.

423
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,740
I've never done coke but I'm always
paranoid that people think I'm doing coke.

424
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,860
Coke. You found some old old coat that
I've, I haven't warned him like 10 years.

425
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,280
I'm just like going through it and I'm
like what the, I just put a little baggy.

426
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,490
Yeah, I had like four lines in it,
but I'm just thinking like who,

427
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,710
what night did I go?
You know what? I'm done.

428
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:13,400
I'm just going to save this for
later. What the fuck man, that's not,

429
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,750
how do you know it's coke? It
might be rice. It might be like,

430
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:21,920
I know how to kill this dummy. But he
hated something you posted on Youtube.

431
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:25,640
I just put some fucking something at
a coke bag and leave it as jacket.

432
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:26,474
Hilson Nord it,

433
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,110
it's true cause I don't remember ever
even buying coke or having somebody wanted

434
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:33,501
to kill you.

435
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:36,170
All do would have to do is buy you drinks
the comedy store and then hand you a

436
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:39,070
bag anthrax and you be like,
fuck cancer

437
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,340
burns. What? Joe? Now this is,
you've changed since I've known you.

438
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,320
I mean you'll like this cosmic
fucking you're doing, what's the Dsm?

439
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,670
Amity DMT. Yeah. That's way
different than coke. No, I know.

440
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,690
No, I know. That's why I'm saying
I would risk a heart attack.

441
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,900
I'd rather do this shit. That shit.
I would never, I'm, I'm scared.

442
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:07,230
Shit of that stuff. Why scared
some people don't come back, dad.

443
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,030
That's not true. That's, it's not
like LSD. It's the thing about DMT.

444
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,630
Well first of all, your brain
makes it, it's common in the body.

445
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:19,250
Well then I have not a bit, I've
never had it. Do you have dreams? Oh,

446
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:23,650
do I ever, there you go. Can I
take a drink? Kava? I have vine.

447
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,100
Samo Kava. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That gives me
dream. Yeah, that'll do it, right? Yeah,

448
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,790
for sure. Yeah. There's a lot of
Melatonin gives some people freaky dreams,

449
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,350
sometimes just taking
vitamins before you go to bed.

450
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:37,910
Sometimes people get weird dreams.

451
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,370
How bout if you kill your wife or
before you go to bed, got over,

452
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,340
make you fucking horrible drink. Just
probably won't sleep. Acetylcholine

453
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,830
is a big one.
Take acetylcholine before you go to sleep.

454
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:50,580
You will have the fucking wild. Is that,
and where do you get this shit? Yo,

455
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,280
it's crazy. Fuck. Well it's, it's
a, it's actually just a plant.

456
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:56,520
It's an extract from plants. It's one
of the main ingredients of Alpha brain.

457
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,440
But who turned, who turned
you on to this shit? Ah,

458
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:03,270
the Internet just started doing
the church. Nicotine Patch.

459
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,730
Just put a nicotine patch before he
go to bed and it keeps your nicotine.

460
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,770
That's a good place for it.
Yeah. Does it really? Yeah.

461
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,420
It keeps your nicotine receptors alive.
Well,

462
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:16,890
there's a bunch of different nutrients
that are shown to have a positive effect

463
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,690
on your memory and the
way your brain functions.

464
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:22,460
So I started researching them about 10
years ago. I started getting into him,

465
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,660
taking different ones,
a bunch of different vitamins.

466
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,830
And it wasn't a bunch of friends that
said, you gotta do this shit. What?

467
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:30,480
DMT is different. I mean, this is,

468
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,510
we're talking about like acetylcholine
and nutrients and perhaps on the DMT DMT

469
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:39,000
or die shit that I've found out about.
Well,

470
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,750
I heard about it first through this
guy named Terrence Mckenna, who was,

471
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:45,900
I've heard about Terence Mckenna
through an old bill Hicks joke.

472
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,250
Bill Hicks did it show talking about yeah,
about tenants with 10 yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,230
With Terence Mckenna would call a heroic
dose. So I was like, who is this test?

474
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,850
That kind of guy. And so I bought a
Terence Mckenna book and I was like,

475
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:58,980
Holy Shit.
Is this guy going deep?

476
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,510
I think I bought a food of
the gods is crazy fuck book.

477
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,040
This guy who was just,
I mean,

478
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:08,970
at the time when I'd never heard anything
about like much about psychedelics,

479
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:12,630
I mean, when I knew people
that did mushrooms just like,
let's get fucked up. Hey,

480
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:13,750
I've got some mushrooms.
Woo,

481
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,010
we're gonna go see some crazy shit that's
not really there. Did you do that shit?

482
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:22,300
Oh No, I didn't do much. I
didn't party at all. Like in,

483
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,710
I might have smoked pot five times
before I was 30 maybe at the most,

484
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:32,640
six or seven before I was 30 when I mean
it was all, it was all when I was drunk.

485
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,520
You know, it's like a party drunk.
Someone's got a joint. Yeah, fuck it.

486
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:37,680
I'll smoke some of that. And then I was
like, oh, I don't want to do that again.

487
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,950
Yeah. You know, it freaked me out. I can't
feel my feet, you know, that kind of shit.

488
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,380
That's what surprises me.
Then you do this shit.

489
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,820
Well then I started getting in a
pot. I enjoy it now. I love pot.

490
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,530
It's one of my favorite tax.
Yeah.

491
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:52,920
Once I hit about 30 31 I started hanging
out with my friend Eddie Bravo and

492
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:54,840
Eddie Bravo,
who is a musician,

493
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:58,710
was telling me that it makes them more
creative that he likes. Like I was like,

494
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:01,950
makes me dopey. And he's like,
you sure? Like if you ever live,

495
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,980
you ever smoked it by itself or
smoking it when you're drinking?

496
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,100
So we smoked some and then I was like,
this is the best shit ever.

497
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:10,110
And we went and got ice
cream Sundaes and I was like,

498
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,990
I can't fucking believe ice cream Sundaes.
Taste is good.

499
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,830
And then you wrote a bit on, no, it's
just true ice cream Sundae. I should,

500
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,850
I probably should have. I missed
the boat. But Sam, really? Oh Dude.

501
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:25,740
Sex feels so much better when you're high
and you kind of weed,

502
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,860
it makes you hyper sensitive.
That's why people get paranoid.

503
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,520
The reason why you get paranoid is
because most of us put blinders on because

504
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,280
you have to to get through
life. I mean there's, you know,

505
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,690
we're on a fucking planet.

506
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,420
We're flying through space or riding
around in metal boxes, you know,

507
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,740
60 miles an hour on the highway.

508
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:45,190
Anybody at any moment in time could just
fucking turn into the oncoming traffic.

509
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:49,540
And you have to put blinders on to get
through life. And we ignore things.

510
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:52,210
And then when you smoked pot, he goes,
hey, you ever think about this? You know,

511
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:54,210
like, yeah, but I'm trying
not to. And then people,

512
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,650
I don't like pot because
it makes me paranoid.

513
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,840
I think it just makes you hyper sensitive.

514
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,480
Last time I smoked, it was in, when
I first moved to New York City,

515
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,550
I was in an acting class.

516
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,580
It's cute girl and go back to her
apartment like five of us from the class,

517
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,170
smoke this shit. Then I had to
go on the way home. I'm going to,

518
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,880
I go to the bank chemical bank,
I'm in line,

519
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm like fourth in line and they had a
digital thing where your number comes up.

520
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,160
So finally I get to the front,

521
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:22,740
my number comes up and I fucking lady
just stared at me and I ran out the door.

522
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,010
That's a true story. Just
freaked out. She look like,

523
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:28,710
I mean school teacher and
I just fucking bolted.

524
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,920
That's the last time that was like
in the early nineties that's fun.

525
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:36,060
Do you want to smoke some? You know, I
bet you would help me with my insomnia,

526
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,060
wouldn't it? Sometimes, but
then again, what if it's really,

527
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,440
I hear it's like the weed
today is obviously way
stronger than what was going on

528
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,270
until like 50 times one hit now
a days and just see if it works.

529
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,740
Got Some rain here and move to pause.
One hit when going to help when his place.

530
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,130
Look at this skulls and shit. That's
all I need. Milkweed and look at this.

531
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,170
This fucking go ted,
you got over here.

532
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:02,850
That's a boost that I shot a couple
months ago. Getting the one oh one

533
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,960
no. Yeah, it was an invader from Canada.

534
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,040
It didn't have his green card.
I fucking took it out from America.

535
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,430
No,
shut that one in Canada.

536
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,630
If you lived around here and
give you some Moose takes.

537
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,360
I've got 400 pounds of it in my
few railing joke. Testosterone man.

538
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,100
It's fucking hilarious. Cousin. I got a
cousin of a hunt with a bow and arrow.

539
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:27,350
He's got all kinds of, yeah,
I've done some of that.

540
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,980
I shot a bear with a bow and arrow.
You do that shit high and Nah, no,

541
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,060
no, no, no. I'm fine. Yeah, it's not
bad. Caveman coffee. I don't, yeah,

542
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,940
firearms and marijuana is not,

543
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,580
I want to be like fucking hyper diligent,

544
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,570
hyper aware on the point.
No fucking around.

545
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:52,250
You know the last thing you ever want
to be involved in is a firearm accident

546
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:53,900
that you could have prevented.
It's a good point.

547
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:58,850
I didn't even think fuck that angle. I
got no, I know guys who do it though.

548
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:01,130
They smoke weed and then go there.
Go fucking bow hunting.

549
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,430
But getting the tree stand, smoke a joint,
sit out there with nature. They like it.

550
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,090
Thrill. At least if you're in a tree
stand and you're shooting a bow and Arrow,

551
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,240
the likelihood of you shooting
yourself is very small.

552
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,470
The likelihood of you shooting somebody
else very small, you know? Yeah.

553
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,810
Cause he in the NGO probably high back
in the day when they were hunting,

554
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,210
they didn't have much marijuana here.
Not We, but they hit pay. Odious dieting.

555
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,480
They use that. But yeah, there's
probably some mushroom use going on too.

556
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,650
But I think they would use that stuff
to sort of like fucking post post,

557
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,550
you know hunt. They're kind
of like celebrate, celebrate
or something like that.

558
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,860
But the vikings, you know, used to use
mushrooms and go on Soda Zercher no,

559
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:44,360
not those guys. They
steroids different vikings.

560
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,570
Who's that fucking giant dude who
there's all these photos of this, some,

561
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,490
some football player. There was like
a bunch of memes with this guy, Steve.

562
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,060
You know what I'm talking about?
It was his steroid precursor. No,

563
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,420
I mean probably who the fuck knows? You
know? I don't know. Is it a college kid?

564
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,950
Is it college hit? Yeah, he's
in college. He's like, oh,

565
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,000
he's saying six eight to
90 or something like that.

566
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:08,660
I mean the people today are
so God damn freaky. Huge.

567
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,900
Yeah. We're present body
fat. It's just run like deer.

568
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,060
Yeah. This is the guy. What? Look at this.
This is not the right picture, but look,

569
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,030
there's one picture of this guy standing
around a bunch of other people and he

570
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:24,800
just like, Yo, what the fuck? How was that
guy? So yeah, that's the photo. That photo

571
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,060
right? Yeah. Yeah. The
size of that mother fucker.

572
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,590
That guy was created in a lab that doesn't
even look like a real person and the

573
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,100
non negative body fat.

574
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,700
What do you got going on? Making the
pitch picture bigger. Oh the, yeah,

575
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,690
that's not the f B. There's a full
photo of them. There it is. Yeah.

576
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,290
See if you can make that better. This
Twitter, Twitter doesn't. When you do,

577
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,700
when you try to enlarge a Twitter photo,
it doesn't let you do that.

578
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:50,750
For some reason. You go to a certain size
and then it blanks out on, yeah. Yeah.

579
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:52,550
He looks like a,
like a lab experiment.

580
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,420
You know when you go back and you look
like Jim Brown back when he was playing

581
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,610
Sean Oakman,
that's the the gentleman's name.

582
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:02,180
I will call him a gentleman from
now on. By the way, he's something,

583
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:05,360
some insane size and
he's still in college.

584
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,170
It just doesn't make any sense.
People are just way bigger now.

585
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,380
I don't know if it's hormones in the meat.
No.

586
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,520
12 year old girls with mustad
handled my various, look at this,

587
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,440
look at this mother fucker cheese.
Just

588
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,850
I fucking Christ. Probably a strong safety
toe. Look at the size of that guide.

589
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,770
It doesn't even look like a human look
how he's towering over the guys next to

590
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:29,290
him. Look at his arms. He said, yeah,
they're popping out of his shell. Well,

591
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,150
why is he have pants on?
They're not going to help pass a useless.

592
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,110
What the fuck? He doesn't have
pads on. Do what the fuck?

593
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,390
What the fuck and naughty. She got a
stomach like a cheerleader. Just, yeah,

594
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,640
those why.
I was thinking that the other day,

595
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:49,050
like how come do it never caught on
with guys to wear like a midriff exposed

596
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:49,770
shirts.

597
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,720
It's like girls wear those exclusively
like midriff in West Hollywood lately.

598
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,480
Yeah, with the tide and the
not in front. That's the best.

599
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,260
Like Ellie Mae fucking clamping

600
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,610
boulevard. Oh, the fucking Beverly
hillbillies. Yeah. Nobody, nobody fucked.

601
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:16,380
Back then you watched the
Beverly hillbillies. Nobody
ever, ever fucked Ellie Mae.

602
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,620
Who? Did she even go on a
date on that Shell? Yeah,

603
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:23,940
with Jethro brother. Then you had
the first lesbian in Hollywood.

604
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:26,490
I think it was mishandled away.
I thought it was Alice.

605
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,740
I think a heavily hillbillies. Alice
from the Brady was Alison, but I think,

606
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,220
oh Christ. Yeah. Christ.
Yeah. She played Texas.

607
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,380
She was a nose tackle before she goes.
She landed the role of Ellis.

608
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,540
See the copy. I'm stumbling over my own
friends and we're getting angry already.

609
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,150
Fucking Shit fucking on people. She
was good, but no, but ms Hathaway was,

610
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:59,151
but I think the Beverly hillbillies
predated the lady that worked at the bank.

611
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:02,070
Yes. There were always
kissing his ass because, yeah,

612
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:03,900
because Jed had all the money.
Yeah.

613
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,390
The one that Dennis Miller said when
he's talking about Bruce John, hey,

614
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,730
when did Bruce Jana Turner to
missions Hathaway from the best?

615
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,050
It's not the best reference,
but I see what he's going.

616
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,680
Oh, exactly. It wasn't, that smell is
a strange cat man. He is a strange guy.

617
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,430
Don't like them. I like him too.
I mean, I, I like him as a person.

618
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,780
I've talked to them, I enjoy
talking to him. But he,

619
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,730
nine 11 came along and that
guy just went flunking.

620
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,230
He took our right turn and hit that gas.
I was already there.

621
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,470
You were always there.
Fuck yeah.

622
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,390
Stuck out like a sore thumb
and Boston didn't I go, well,

623
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,060
Boston's a little right wing. I mean,
there's a lot of left wing in Boston,

624
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:46,710
but there's a lot of right wing too.
You're right.

625
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:49,800
It's so left that we used to
talk about this at Nick's.

626
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,470
It's so left wing that
it came full circle.

627
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,030
They started to have shit and
common like people from Southie and,

628
00:36:57,031 --> 00:37:01,950
and you know, it was,
remember Barry Crimmins you
remember though, you know, um,

629
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,080
I was talking to bobcat this weekend.

630
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:08,490
Bobcat Goldthwait came to the UFC and I
got him and his daughter's boyfriend is

631
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:09,530
a big UFC fan.

632
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,930
I got him some tickets and hung out with
them and he just did a documentary on

633
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:15,900
Barry Crimmins and that's right.
I heard them talking about it.

634
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:19,280
It's pretty intense piece sick
now. Barry Wright is he, he,

635
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:22,200
he was a couple of years ago, they
had a benefit for him. Oh, I didn't,

636
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,780
I didn't know about that.
Yeah, but this was about, uh,

637
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:29,700
Barry was apparently you molested
as a child, as a young child.

638
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:34,360
And this, this is sort of like
explaining how we became this,

639
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:37,410
like sort of angry, curmudgeon,
right. Type into prep,

640
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,480
patently of fucking really deep
and intense documentary. And,

641
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,350
uh,
it's coming out,

642
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:46,740
it's gonna be on Sundance and there
they're going to come on the show in, um,

643
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,510
sometime either late January
or February, but, um, it's a,

644
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,230
it's a fucked up,

645
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,290
fucked up bobcat title to like call
me lucky or something like that.

646
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,140
Like I'll be like, I like, that's
what he, you know, he named the, uh,

647
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,770
the documentary, something along
those lines. He told me the title.

648
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:08,520
It was howling laughing, but yeah,
Barry Crimmins was like super left.

649
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,410
I remember hearing that him saying that
he came out one night and he would have

650
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:17,970
broke down on stage. It
stitches about that. Whoa.
That's what I remember hearing.

651
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,930
I don't think, I can't remember if I had
already moved to New York at that point,

652
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:25,800
but I remember somebody telling me second
hand that he like that he let it all

653
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:27,870
out on stage one night or something.
But you know,

654
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,970
left wing back then was a different
thing. Oh yeah. Hell yeah.

655
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,890
It was way more tolerant. Yeah,
it was way, way more tolerant or,

656
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,580
and now it's become a lot of
like shaming and call outs.

657
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:44,020
It's become this aggressive
tactic thing like the, the uh,

658
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,800
aggressively left wing in
your face about it, which is,

659
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,720
it creates conflict more than it resolves
anything. Absolutely. You know, I mean,

660
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:53,554
Barry was like,

661
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,100
he was like a pro union guy because he
believed that people should get good

662
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,850
wages. He bought American beer. He
would always drink a Budweiser stage.

663
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,180
I was a bar back. I used to carry
that. I carry a case of bud.

664
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,790
I was a bar back for like six
months in stitches. I'll refer.

665
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:10,390
I started comedy with
Suzy. Suzy. Remember Susie,

666
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:14,360
the manager of a stitches, she
was in that band. They had a,

667
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:19,060
a parody band where they walk like an
Egyptian without walk with an erection.

668
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,780
Harry can 40 was running it at
the town and but barrier. Right.

669
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:29,530
I used to bring a case of Budweiser and
you're right now we think back on it.

670
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,470
He was hiding something. He would
drink that case throughout the night.

671
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,070
That'd be maybe two left. I mean,
wow. In about them. You know,

672
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,450
I sit around after and he had a cooler
and he's the only guy that ever tip me as

673
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:45,020
a bar back. He was a kid, big walrus
mustache. He was kind of intimidating.

674
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,460
And what's funny is I know
it's like really critical.

675
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:50,260
He so I mean radical left wing,

676
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:53,260
but he used to make me laugh as hard
as any bunch and me tingle and tingle.

677
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,120
I mean the funny guy,
no doubt about it.

678
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,640
I always quote tingles
joke about Ronald Reagan.

679
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,950
This was when I was an open miker.

680
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,940
I saw him perform this cause when I was
an open mic or was right after the whole

681
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:05,380
Reagan Contra thing and went down,

682
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:10,220
I was like 1988 and right after Reagan was
out of office, they were, they were, uh,

683
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,770
he was on trial and they were asking
him, did you sell arms to Iran? He said,

684
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:17,230
I don't remember. I don't
recall. Mr President,

685
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,540
who you sent when you sell arms to
people who hate us, shut it down.

686
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:29,100
That is a perfect Boston Jimmy tingle
is this such a great line shot down?

687
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:35,170
That is a good tangle jog. Yeah, he
was good. He and he's another one.

688
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:39,880
He's like real left wing but reasonable
in his left wing. Absolutely.

689
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,211
You know,

690
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:45,211
it's like left wing now has become this
like super hyper fascist funks there's

691
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,540
like I've experienced,

692
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:51,541
I experienced it at a pretty hardcore
way when I came out again and I'm pretty

693
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:56,890
fucking left wing and a lot of issues
on gay rights, on gay marriage, on a,

694
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,480
a lot of different issues on
racial issues, but I also own guns.

695
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,510
I'm in the NRA.
I'm a lot a lot of like,

696
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,650
I feel like there's a lot of
credible issues on both sides.

697
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:14,070
But there was this guy who got a sex
change and then started fighting women in

698
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:16,480
MMA. I was like, get the fuck out of here.

699
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,310
And all these people were calling me
transphobic and big ed and all this crazy

700
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:23,680
shit and that's when I got really,

701
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,890
that's when I really experienced the full
understanding of what it means to be a

702
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:29,620
social justice warrior.
Right.

703
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,280
Anytime a man is critical of women,
anytime a man Shit's a woman, that guy

704
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:39,050
cause 10 bucks. That's
it. She has one arm,

705
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,050
we don't shit on them.
Shit on the ones for a thousand.

706
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:44,480
You don't even feel bad about it.
It's like we got, you got paid well,

707
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,280
but anytime a man is doing something
horrible against a woman or saying

708
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,210
something like that,
that guy becomes a misogynist less,

709
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,710
you're criticizing a transgender person.

710
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,890
See transgender is more
marginalized than women.

711
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,240
So a transgender guy who becomes
a girl now can fight women.

712
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,110
And if you criticize that,

713
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:09,980
you're criticizing a former guy
who's now a girl and that's like,

714
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,980
yeah,
it gets both

715
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,111
cause that,
right.

716
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:23,111
So he's fighting guys now at least he's
out what she is out of the closet or you

717
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:26,920
know, not, I shouldn't say
out of the closet. I said uh,

718
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,610
out and open about it because the first
two women she fought didn't know that

719
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:36,260
she used to be a guy. I saw some of this
on. It was fucking crazy. What's crazy?

720
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,130
His name is no need.

721
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,810
No need to get this captain
anymore fucking publicity
than she's already gotten

722
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,590
this. Just cause it. She had a hundred
youtube videos complaining about me.

723
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,860
But the bottom line dailies,
yeah, there's, there's two,

724
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,600
there's two schools about it. There's
transgender reassignment doctors who say,

725
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:55,010
no,
she's totally a woman's toe.

726
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,930
But then there's martial artists and
then a regular endocrinologist. They go,

727
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:03,080
Whoa, Whoa, hold on a second. Like,
yeah, talking about just regular sports.

728
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,620
And I'm talking about someone
who's competing and say,
you know, fucking madness,

729
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:09,080
like racing Renee Richards,

730
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:11,210
there was another one who was
on a mountain bike weight racer,

731
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,250
forgot riding a mountain bike racer who
dominated all the women in her first

732
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:18,800
professional event is
beating him like fucking 10,

733
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:21,740
15 seconds faster than everybody.
And it was like, what the fuck?

734
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,880
And these are like a lot of people like
encouraged her to get into, you know,

735
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,780
competing as a woman. And then, you know,

736
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:33,050
just the inherent differences of the
fucking male and female frame really get

737
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:36,880
highlighted when you watch somebody
beat the shit out of somebody who is a

738
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,560
natural born woman versus
someone who's becoming a woman.

739
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,320
He tells you certain
things you can't change.

740
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,530
Jodie, you remember, you remember
Super Foot Wallace? Fuck yeah, I do.

741
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Do you remember when the woman went up
against him on why were all the sports?

742
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,730
No. Ah, why did she go wonder if it's
Stella around while it wasn't even,

743
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,150
can't be cause a kickboxing.
Yes, Bill. Super Fun.

744
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,550
I don't know what Billie Jean King and
the whole movement was in full swing and

745
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:06,200
this broad comes running
out and he fucking drops her
like a used rubber fucking

746
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:11,060
the first who's I came as a round house
or just a paunch probably a hook kick or

747
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:13,900
a punch because he had the,
he had the best hook kick and say,

748
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,290
I want to say it was a kick to the head.

749
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:18,620
Then they drag her back to a court and
they sit her up again and they send her

750
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:23,000
out again and he does it again. No
Way. Yes. Really map as a kid going,

751
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:26,300
what the fuck? Sharing. Oh,

752
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,930
there's a woman named Lucio Riker.

753
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,890
It was probably one of the best women
boxers of all time and she fought a guy

754
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,280
and it was like one of the
first, uh, men versus female.

755
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:38,940
She has fought a mediocre guy and she's
like a world champion that everybody

756
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,490
like Christy Martin was docket
are all these women were docker.

757
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,800
She wasn't going to kill that man.
We're the coal miner's daughter.

758
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,540
This does this,

759
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,500
this Lucy Lucier Riker chick was arguably
one of the best female boxers of all

760
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:49,741
time.

761
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:54,630
Got fucking lit up like a Christmas
tree by this dude and knocked dead just

762
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:55,464
womp.

763
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,440
He caught her with a punch
and just fucking turned the
lights out in Georgia and

764
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:01,440
she face planted. It was ugly
because you know, you're,

765
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:04,640
you're watching a guy beat the
shit out of a chair. It's just,

766
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:07,640
it doesn't matter if they're the same
weight class, it doesn't matter if they,

767
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,960
they have the same amount of body mass.
It's a different structure. Well, I,

768
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:14,940
Chris Rock said, yeah, you know, we
were talking about that. He goes, yeah,

769
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:18,230
you still have a hundred and he
still had 105 pound chin though.

770
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,210
That's the deference or whatever.
Well, they can definitely,

771
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:24,390
men can definitely take punches better
for the most part when it's guys that are

772
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,280
built much more slender and feminine,

773
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:29,940
but this one woman who
used to be a man is not,

774
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:34,410
is not built feminine. You know, you get
man shoulders and fucking man hands, man,

775
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:37,710
hands hit harder, man. Shoulders are
wider. The whole deal. It's just,

776
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,860
but the point being until then I had
not experienced the full impact of the

777
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:47,880
progressive movement, the full
aggressive response. Totally a logically.

778
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,270
I'm like, look, we're just, we're not
talking about her right to be a woman.

779
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:52,560
I fully support that.
You want to,

780
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:56,730
I wouldn't know what it was like
to be born a man as a problem.

781
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,050
I fully support you changing
your, your sex. No problem
at all. Change your gender.

782
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,580
No problem at all.
I have no problem with,

783
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,080
I'll call you whatever the fuck you want,

784
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,050
but if you beat the shit out of my sister,
I'm probably going to come out to you.

785
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,670
This is going to be honest with you.

786
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:12,240
I try to be tolerant until I find out
that you did not disclose the fact that

787
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:15,100
used to be a man and my sister's in the
fucking hospital cause you're shinned

788
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,030
her in the head. You know? It's
like this is a different world.

789
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:20,340
You're talking about. You're talking
about the world of combat sports.

790
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,800
That's my world and I'm
telling you right now,

791
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:26,580
there's a big goddamn difference between
the way a man hits a bag and the way a

792
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:30,120
woman hits the bag. He watched the
difference between the impact. I'm not,

793
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:34,140
I don't know how much gets taken away
by that sex change, but not enough.

794
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,340
Not Enough. That's right. Just this,
just, just too much. That's good.

795
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:43,200
More out the dead, which you can't.
You know what? You can't change, dude,

796
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,060
that you can't change the size of
the fists. You can't change the,

797
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,370
the the you mean? Yeah, the
frame, the frame. If you,

798
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,690
that woman dies and a thousand years
now scientists dig up her body,

799
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,990
they're going to go, oh, there's
a dude that's a dude skeleton.

800
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,870
There is going to know that it
was transgender. It's a woman.

801
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,690
They're not going to know that. They're
going to say, this is a male skeleton,

802
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:06,420
looks at the hips. That's,
those are male hips. They,

803
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:10,140
that was a boundary that even
feminists used to stay away from,

804
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:12,480
but now they seem to be
pushing that. Like I, I was,

805
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:15,000
I was a Gotham a couple of years.
I've got to fight breaks.

806
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:17,530
I had nothing to do with me on stage.
Like two tables get into it.

807
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:22,550
And there was women right in the middle
of it swinging over what? I Dunno, they,

808
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,160
someone was being loud and another
table complaint and those boyfriends and

809
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:28,410
girlfriends at the table. Then they
just started fucking swinging on it.

810
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,010
And there was a girl right in

811
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,570
the middle. She's trying to
hit the doorman and the other
doorman came over. Whoa.

812
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,410
Fucking knocked out the doorman.
She know he popped her. Yeah,

813
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:40,180
that's what I'm saying. Yeah.
Or he at the Dorman yesterday.

814
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,280
You don't fuck around at Gotham. Those
were all former cops. It's exactly Pfizer,

815
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:49,310
a big fucking Irish squared jaw sandwiches
that have knocked a lot of fucking

816
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:51,060
head's loose.
Yeah.

817
00:47:51,061 --> 00:47:54,520
And these chicks right in the middle
fucking throat trying to throw haymakers

818
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,730
because they bought into this
shit. Yeah. You know what I mean?

819
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:58,900
They're going a little too far with it.

820
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,820
Did you see the woman trying
to play football? No. On the
Internet? No. Look it up,

821
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:07,720
but it was an indoor league or
an arena league or whatever.

822
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,680
It's like first and goal from the five
yard line. She's a female. Run them.

823
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,640
And I don't mean like a big, because
I'm a woman. She just thinks she's fast.

824
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,370
She tries to, yeah, they tried to run
her off tackle like four times and she,

825
00:48:19,371 --> 00:48:23,110
each time she gets hit more bro.
Even how it was like cringing,

826
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,840
I don't even know.
I don't even know her name.

827
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:29,230
It was like an indoor league or
arena league, but it said, you know,

828
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,620
she was like the first one,
first female to play in a pro game.

829
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:37,330
That wasn't a kicker. Physical equality
is nonexistent. It's just nonexistent.

830
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,080
And it's definitely, it's
not even existent inside
the genders. Male you like,

831
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:46,110
there's certain fucking men. Oh, it
just guys who fight in the UFC. Oh,

832
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,010
you're just like this guy,
Hector Lombard.

833
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:52,180
There's fucking freak of nature of this
Cuban Olympian judo player who's just

834
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,390
fucking knockout artists. You watch
him fight and you're like, Whoa,

835
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,450
homos is unfair that he
fights regular people

836
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,700
even though they're bald.
They're all 170 pounds.

837
00:49:02,701 --> 00:49:07,180
That's a fucking different hundred
and 70 pounds. But at least there,

838
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,230
I mean it's, there's no fair when it comes
to that shit and that's part of what,

839
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,930
what it is to be a champion.
Like what is this five foot,

840
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:17,950
230 pound female running back plays a
professional football game. Watch the,

841
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,560
oh no, she's still alive. All right.

842
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,300
Two guys that knocked her out.
Why would she do that?

843
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:30,070
She was taking shots like I've let
say, please pray the play. That's it.

844
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,530
And they give the bottle
like three times in a row.

845
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,580
Are we going to get pulled from youtube?
Let's see.

846
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,620
Let's,
we'll edit this ladies and gentlemen.

847
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,550
And if we get pulled from Youtube
Jamille just edit that peanut.

848
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:49,180
I think Google it. What's the name of it?
Uh, the, the, it's called five foot two.

849
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:50,110
It's on Daily Mail.

850
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,520
Five foot two 130 pound female running
back plays in professional football game.

851
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,100
But I think the video is actually
pulled from this website.

852
00:49:57,101 --> 00:49:59,530
So really by her husband.
Yeah,

853
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:04,510
cause this is not playing
the fucking United Nations
as a crime against humanity.

854
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:09,100
Right. Here's a picture
though. Oh God. Look at her
getting smashed. That's not it.

855
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,630
That's not it though. That's not her.
Well that might be, that's it. That's the,

856
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,950
that's the clip. Oh, here we go.

857
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:19,430
Jesus Christ.
That was her about to go in.

858
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:24,350
They just smashed her. You got up. She
gets a round of applause for getting up.

859
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:25,420
Not

860
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,430
Dead Up.
Congratulations.

861
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,300
She's not dead.

862
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,060
They give her the ball three times
in a row and each kid is more savage.

863
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:35,150
I'm sitting there going, what the
fuck? But she's tough as nails. She,

864
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:39,910
she didn't go off the pill.
That's hurt. You see your flaws.

865
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,810
You see it go flying through the air
through her. Don't, let's not watch this.

866
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,100
I don't want to watch that. Yeah.
When people can I laugh crazy.

867
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,420
Why would you laugh? It makes me
sad. Big check. Trying to play again.

868
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:55,020
I have daughters. I don't want it
to be that stupid. All they woman,

869
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,650
you wouldn't let him do that, would you?
I put them, I can. I can't control them.

870
00:50:57,651 --> 00:50:58,371
They become adults.

871
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:00,380
They can do whatever the fuck you
can give him that mine offering shit.

872
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:03,460
You though show you got
to see this last one,

873
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,260
this humongous Chi.

874
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:13,070
Here we go. Watch this.
She's got the ball. Oh,

875
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,410
fucking Christ. Look
at, she pops right up.

876
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:21,610
That's a tough chick. Oh yeah.
Oh, she's probably played,
I guess before you got to,

877
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,093
you got to juice

878
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,500
even she's juicing, you know, God. I mean,

879
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,950
you'd have to juice for so long that
you actually became a man. We had a, um,

880
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,920
a guy in the podcast that used to be a
woman and became a man, a buck angel.

881
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,680
She's Kinda Belamine.
Well, when she was a woman,

882
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:43,240
she was built like slender and now
he's a man and he's pretty thick.

883
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,990
And He, at one point in time we got
to like one 85. He was fucking Yolk.

884
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,180
But you said it was like too
much pressure on the joints,

885
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:53,650
like because he just fucking bang
and testosterone doing dead lifts,

886
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,160
but this, you know, there's
only so much that changes.

887
00:51:57,161 --> 00:52:00,430
It doesn't change the size of your fucking
face and the size of your hands and

888
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:05,050
all that stuff gets smashed. You know?
How does, let me ask you a question.

889
00:52:05,051 --> 00:52:08,290
How does Stallone, he's 68
he's still Joseph, right? Yeah.

890
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,770
I watch these movies and he's ripped.
He's more than 68 now.

891
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,660
I think he's almost 70 I'm, I'm, I'm ready
to juice. Yeah, you should do it. Yeah.

892
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,200
It's testosterone replacement
therapy. Where Ellie? Yeah.

893
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,790
Do it. Give me a name of the
doc. Damn, I'm good. Sherry.

894
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,510
Physique of fucking buddy Epson. Yeah.
Listen, it makes it the Beverly Hills Rep.

895
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:31,780
The bottom line still alone in 68 yeah.
He's my canary in a coal mine.

896
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:35,530
As long as I fucking guy's alive. We're
all good. I'm telling you that. Look it,

897
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,040
there's a lot of science involved in it.
And if you go to the right doctor, right,

898
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,860
you make sure that you get your level,

899
00:52:41,861 --> 00:52:44,200
your blood levels checked
on a regular basis.

900
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:48,160
It's not any more dangerous than aging.
Aging's fucking terrible.

901
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,740
A great point agent gets you.
No matter what you do,

902
00:52:50,741 --> 00:52:52,870
everybody dies from aging
and the people are like, oh,

903
00:52:52,871 --> 00:52:56,530
that's eventually going to kill
you. Oh, like unlike life. Well,

904
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,910
I'm going to get cheated out of a month.
Listen, you know it's, he's got a good,

905
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,470
a new Rambo. He's doing
a new fucking rhino. No,

906
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,150
just calling it laugh.
Last blood.

907
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:09,610
Somebody said is that somebody
made a menopause joke about it.

908
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:14,260
I forget who it was.
Somebody said that already

909
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:19,660
has never been the fucking [inaudible]
68 year old guy that looks like him. No,

910
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,760
I mean, my wife says I'm in love with
them and that kind of now I like Stellato.

911
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,540
He still sucks me in and don't like
those. Look at that. The fuck out of here.

912
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:32,310
We have that picture of him. Will you that
picture of, that's recent. Look at that.

913
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:37,910
That's recent. How is that
possible man? Testosterone. What?

914
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,360
That's what's missing from old people.
So my GNC pills, that's a test us Ronnie,

915
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:45,810
not cutting it does a bunt. Those,
those help a little do that, you know,

916
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:50,811
you know it helps a lot is I'm dead
lifts and squats on that hill sprints and

917
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:55,560
anytime you do something that's like
compound exercises that require your body

918
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,960
to like put out a lot of energy,
like big bursts, evangelists,

919
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,520
those force your endocrine system to
fire up because your body's like this

920
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:07,930
motherfucker is going to be
lifting weights like he's going to,

921
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,120
he's going to do this all the time.

922
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,400
We got to produce a lot more
hormones than we regularly are.

923
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:14,160
But if you just sit around in a
fucking office and you don't exercise,

924
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,140
your testosterone levels are just,

925
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,180
your body only does what
it has to do this right?

926
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,580
That's why people get muscle
atrophy when they don't work out.

927
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:22,290
Your muscles shrink
because your body's like,

928
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:25,190
we don't need things that happens to
young people. And if you don't work out,

929
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,310
your body is like,
we don't need this.

930
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,960
Well that's the same
thing when you get old.

931
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,220
If you get old and you're not lifting
weights, your bone density decreases.

932
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,870
A lot of shit happens. My, my
giant stuff, I did p 90 x, right?

933
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,160
I did, you know, he's supposed to do it
for 90 days. I did it for like 11 months.

934
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,310
I got obsessed with, whoa.
And I dropped like 10 pounds,

935
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,820
which is all I wanted to drop. I was
in like this, I, I did this like, uh,

936
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:51,510
it ended about a year and a half ago,
but I kept doing it.

937
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,670
You only supposed to do and there's a
reason you're only supposed to do it

938
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,930
because it's kind of tough on your joints.
So I did it for like 11 my Austin.

939
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,070
I get up my,
my knees a clicking

940
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:05,270
and it's not because it's not because
the p nights, because I abused it. Right.

941
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,390
You know, I mean, there's a lot of jump
acts is a lot of stuff that people say.

942
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:13,150
It's kind of out of fashion now. Uh, well,
not out of fat, but you know, I mean, um,

943
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,160
I just not for a guy in his
fifties and I may, yeah. Well,

944
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:19,200
there's some people that have
some good ideas about like,

945
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,860
and limitations are a lot of times based
on injuries, like, oh, this guy got it,

946
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,590
he hurt his back. Well, don't do that
anymore and you won't hurt your back.

947
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,740
There's a lot of ideas that people have,
but it's,

948
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,260
it's all about knowing your body,

949
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,990
knowing how much stress you put on your
body and giving your body plenty of

950
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:37,380
recovery time and then giving your
body the right nutrients to recover.

951
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,740
Like fish oil, vitamin D, protein,

952
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:45,630
a full range of multivitamins. This is
super important for your body and food,

953
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,940
like eating the right foods.
That's, that's very important.

954
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,000
Like all the vitamins in the world,

955
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:51,000
they're not going to help you if you're
eating fucking cheeseburgers every day.

956
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:55,020
Who else did you eat
healthy? Oh yeah. Yeah,

957
00:55:55,690 --> 00:56:00,030
a lot of salmon, chicken. Let a protein,
vegetables, that's me. You know,

958
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,380
just enough carbs to fuel
me. And it worked. Yeah, it
worked. Fucking awesome. Oh,

959
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:08,370
you did everything because you get your
heart rate goes through the roof and,

960
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:11,340
and uh, no, there's no digest.
Abused it. I, I got it.

961
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:14,610
I had never done anything that worked
like that since I was in my twenties and I

962
00:56:14,611 --> 00:56:18,000
played football in college. I was the
best shape I was in and I was like,

963
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:21,870
Holy Shit. And that's what we were doing
back then. We were doing, you know,

964
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:24,100
a lot of plyometrics and right.
And that's

965
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,030
what we did in college to get, and I
was in great condition, but I couldn't,

966
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:31,570
I was doing it six times a week and
he's supposed to stop at the 90 days.

967
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,660
I didn't know you're supposed to stand up.
I just thought it was 90 days.

968
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:35,170
You're in your 50s you are,
you know,

969
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:38,830
I mean if you're 25 you can
fucking do it for three years.

970
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:43,530
I'm sure the guy that does it is like 50
oh, he's older than that now Tony. Yeah,

971
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,550
Tony Go. Great shape. I know.

972
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,560
Do you know,
isn't it?

973
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,290
There's another one that you can
do that's called the extreme,

974
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:53,320
a kettlebell cardio workout by this guy,
Keith Weber does not.

975
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,800
No jumping and no, none of
that stuff. It's all just want,

976
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,940
I do it with a 30 little bell.
He saw that out there.

977
00:56:58,941 --> 00:57:02,010
I tried to pick it up and I got, well,
I'm done with that shit. That's 70 pounds,

978
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:04,170
so that's a heavy one.
Just this one was a light one.

979
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:08,310
It's just a full cardio
workout. It's fucking, you
pick up a 35 pound Kettlebell,

980
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:13,000
it feels like nothing, but after
like a man, Holy Shit. You're like,

981
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:16,560
how much time is this going? It's
a 45 minute workout. Oh my God,

982
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,730
20 minutes in your fucking legs are
on fire. Your lungs are on fire,

983
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:24,480
but it's very low stress and your joint
because there's not a lot of weight and

984
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:26,760
it's not like no,
no jumping or anything like that.

985
00:57:26,761 --> 00:57:30,150
I fucking love that workout and do
it all the time. It's fantastic,

986
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:34,290
but it's like one of those ones. He's
doing it so you do it, you follow along.

987
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,000
Those are the best ones. That's
what's good about that. P Nine zero x.

988
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:40,680
It's like exactly. Do what they're
doing and then you know it's over.

989
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,890
When you're done, you
show up. Yeah, that's,

990
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:47,420
I'm his fucking just actually doing
shit like so many people like, ah,

991
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,330
I want to get in shape

992
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:52,230
the fucking guy that's all just
fucking do it. Nobody does it.

993
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,140
It just fucking talk about it, talk
about it. He said that and one a,

994
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:57,870
and one of the things he goes,
just show up and hit play and it,

995
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,560
that actually set off the thing in
my hand, no matter how Shitty I felt,

996
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,394
I'd gone on and go,

997
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,310
yeah. You know, I always
give myself advice like, uh,

998
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,760
like something like a lot of times
when I land somewhere I'm like, oh,

999
00:58:08,761 --> 00:58:11,820
I don't want to go to the gym, you know?
And I'm like, oh, come on pussy man up.

1000
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:14,200
And then I tell myself like,
all right,

1001
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,760
I pretend like I'm talking to me and I
call myself a pussy and then I just go.

1002
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:20,820
But I always feel better when I do,
you know,

1003
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,990
it's like knowing when you feel like
shit because you're getting sick and

1004
00:58:24,991 --> 00:58:29,820
knowing when you feel like shit,
just because this mother fucker gets up.

1005
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:32,820
I'll tell you what that
mother fucker gets up.

1006
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,200
He put that picture up. Brian,
I read an article. He said
he, when he was, you know,

1007
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:42,090
when he was doing the, the, the,
uh, the, uh, expendables, no,

1008
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:45,870
the first blood Rambo, he was so
obsessed with working out. He'd go,

1009
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,970
he'd be out in south beach,
shit paste,

1010
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:51,390
and then go right to the jump drunk
at three in the morning. Really? Yeah.

1011
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:54,020
When he was drunk, he didn't
stay alone with workouts. Yes.

1012
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,490
He said he was obsessed with it.
I didn't even know he got drunk.

1013
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,980
That's what he said. Well,
he said he was at bars.

1014
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:01,650
I'm guessing that's what he was doing
and he'd go right to the frigging gym.

1015
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,300
That's hilarious.
Three in the morning.

1016
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:06,900
Well that's if you fall the rock,
fall, the rocks Instagram page.

1017
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:10,530
If you ever want to feel like a lazy fuck,
follow the rocks Instagram page.

1018
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:14,370
He'll like fucking fly somewhere at five
o'clock in the morning and he's like,

1019
00:59:14,371 --> 00:59:19,230
touchdown 5:00 AM gym five 30.
And he's like the gym doing fucking,

1020
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,260
sorry,
has the kettlebells,

1021
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,300
kettlebells. Yeah. Yeah, he's on
it. I'll fly to a hotel in the gym.

1022
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:31,330
I could see it from my room. I won't go
to it now. Just stare at it. It's old.

1023
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,220
It's a fucking, it's gonna get me
hurt. So Nautilus, they're updated.

1024
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,630
They're bad for your joints. Pull that
picture up. Look at this motherfucker.

1025
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,940
70 years old of hilarious.
Yeah.

1026
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:44,390
Look how he's looking out the window.

1027
00:59:44,391 --> 00:59:46,590
You move to shoot somebody
who killed somebody as well.

1028
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,720
It's going to frigging nine pack. He's an
actor. Look at, he's awesome. That's true.

1029
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,720
If I knew somebody, you know, if I
knew 12 main people going to see me,

1030
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,550
how to actually put in
the time. Yeah. I mean,

1031
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,700
but when it's my wife who gives a fuck?
Yeah. Listen Bitch, you gonna suck it.

1032
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:06,530
And whether you like it or not,
we're getting divorced.

1033
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:11,090
You decide you want to be lonely.
Ah, rude. That's a great idea.

1034
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:14,360
I never thought about that. You use
divorced, like suck it or divorce.

1035
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:18,680
You're not a good idea. That's
why you're not married. Yeah.

1036
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,770
I say, yeah. I say something ridiculous
and he's like, what a great idea.

1037
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,880
I'm joking around. He's like, hey,
this is doctor. Let me write this down.

1038
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:33,260
When did you get married five years
ago. Was it fun? I know you get kids,

1039
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:35,690
but I don't know yet. For some reason
I didn't think you were married.

1040
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,190
I held off for a while. I think marriage
is ridiculous, but I'm not going to wear,

1041
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,260
I have kids. I love having kids. I
even enjoy being married, but I don't.

1042
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:49,550
I think the idea of a legal contract
with the state and illegal more,

1043
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:52,730
more ridiculous is the idea that you bring
a bunch of people that you don't even

1044
01:00:52,731 --> 01:00:55,010
know and if you decide to break up,

1045
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,070
they decide where all the money goes
and you have to split things up.

1046
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,940
And I've had some friends that have gone
through some absolutely fucking brutal

1047
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:06,200
divorces. Will you understand what
divorce really is? It's a business.

1048
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,280
I mean the,
the,

1049
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:12,100
the marriage system in this country and
the encouragement is involved in getting

1050
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,340
marriage. Getting married is about
selling diamonds. That's a big one.

1051
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:20,840
And then distribution of assets, which
a big part of go to the legal system.

1052
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:23,620
That's when people don't think about
Phil Hartman was the first one to fucking

1053
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:27,290
the tro turned me onto that. But
how about the flip side, you know,

1054
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,710
illegitimate kids and all that and know,
well,

1055
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,240
the solution to the family
and how that turns out, well,

1056
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:33,890
what's legitimate and what's not.
I mean,

1057
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:36,320
if you're together and you're
the father and she's the mother,

1058
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:39,620
you fucking jump over a broom. Like they
didn't roots and you say, we're married.

1059
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,720
You know,
I have friends that have kids that they,

1060
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,420
they changed their names and
they're not married. You know,

1061
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:47,360
they decide we don't need to
do this legally. You know,

1062
01:01:47,361 --> 01:01:51,530
I have friends that got married like on
a Lark, like they're not really married.

1063
01:01:51,531 --> 01:01:53,890
They got married by a
friend, you know, like dude.

1064
01:01:53,891 --> 01:01:56,630
And they went through a whole
ceremony, dug Stan hope, did that.

1065
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,110
He got married and was like a fake.
And then like when she went crazy,

1066
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:02,450
he was like, well, I guess, uh,
let's not be married anymore.

1067
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,480
They just don't have to go to court. I
didn't understand. Help. Got Married.

1068
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,750
You got married. While that
wasn't real, it wasn't real.

1069
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,930
It's just like they did everything
except signing the actual papers.

1070
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:16,040
They wear the rings or whatever. If he
went to court, if she took them to court,

1071
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,770
I bet she could file. Yeah, I
bet. Back then they were together.

1072
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,000
She get all his suits. Yeah. She would get
all those fucking goofy suits he wears.

1073
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:26,850
Isn't there like a law, if you live
with somebody for over seven years,

1074
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:31,140
that's a domestic partner or that could
be kind of law, common law. Marriage.

1075
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:33,450
That's right. Is that an
all state? I don't think so.

1076
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,940
I think it varies state by state,
but California, it's definitely, uh,

1077
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:41,160
it exists in California and there's also
a thing about being married more than a

1078
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:46,150
certain amount of time. I have a friend
who was married for 12 years in, uh,

1079
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,190
you know, fucking towards the end. It was
brutal. We couldn't deal with anymore.

1080
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,810
No kids broke up with her,

1081
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:56,990
has to pay alimony for the
rest of her life forever.

1082
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,260
She apparently, because he paid
for her for 12 years. I mean,

1083
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:06,320
she's like 49, 50. She might live, he's
paying him. No, no, no, no, no, no,

1084
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:10,050
no, no. He's paying forever.
Forever. He's paying a forever.

1085
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:14,610
They were married when she was 30
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1086
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,540
This is California divorce law.
Talking about America.

1087
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:22,500
When you go,
it's the People's Republic of California.

1088
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:25,650
When you'd go through a certain amount
of years of marriage in California,

1089
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:29,670
you are obligated. If you are the
guy who's, was it the caretaker?

1090
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,700
I don't know how to describe it. If you're
the guy who's got the money with it,

1091
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:36,120
with a friend, be Kurt Russell. No, it's
different guy. What was he doing? He,

1092
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:38,790
Curtis was never married and never
got married again because of that.

1093
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,450
Goldie Hawn. Well, they both have
money though. My friend was married.

1094
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,610
His wife was just fucking
getting her nails done,

1095
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:47,850
bringing her little fucking
showed a tiny dog, get it washed.

1096
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,650
He has to pay her for
the rest of her life.

1097
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:53,850
He's married now to another woman and
he pays her exorbitant amounts of money

1098
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:57,930
every month, and she lives in his
old house in the fucking Palisades.

1099
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:01,080
It's sweet house,
and she moved her boyfriend in.

1100
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:04,270
And when you're living with a man,
then it's supposed to be, you know, he,

1101
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,580
he's not supposed to pay anymore.

1102
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,100
So he brings an investigator
into the situation.

1103
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,410
The investigator goes
and they check the house.

1104
01:04:10,411 --> 01:04:12,270
The guy moves out when
the investigator comes,

1105
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,240
he's around the corner with a fucking
u haul. As soon as they leave,

1106
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:20,160
comes back around my shit back. They go
through this little dance where they do,

1107
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:23,370
if she gets married again,
he doesn't have to pay her anymore.

1108
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:27,390
But then she'd lose out on hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year. I mean,

1109
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,660
I think he pays or something like six
or 700 grand a year. Well that's why,

1110
01:04:30,661 --> 01:04:34,530
and I'm not saying this is justified, but
that's why a lot of guys snap. Oh yeah.

1111
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:39,600
I mean, same with all the,
uh, you know, child custody
thing. Like you know, it all,

1112
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:43,260
it's all favor towards the mom and
that case and guys fucking snap. Well,

1113
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:46,810
in some cases it's justified,
but they do, uh, the, the,

1114
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,790
the systems are fucked up because first
of all, these people don't know you.

1115
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,950
So if you go into court and you know,

1116
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:55,560
it's everyone's trying to present their
argument like they're the perfect person.

1117
01:04:55,561 --> 01:04:58,020
I am the perfect husband. I was
the perfect dad. I, you know,

1118
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:01,080
my wife is a crazy bitch. You know,
I was the perfect mom, my husband,

1119
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:05,730
they weren't there. Yeah. I've
also had friends that their um,

1120
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:07,500
their wives when they're breaking up,

1121
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,430
we'll file a restraining order and say
that he was threatening and being abusive.

1122
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,420
And if it's just you
and her alone that she,

1123
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:17,040
they can say all kinds
of crazy shit and that's

1124
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,950
a guy would snap. Well, I mean,
if you're going to ruin my life,

1125
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:25,300
I have a friend who was a woman who was
getting divorced and her lawyer advised

1126
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:28,900
her to do that and she was
like, what? Like she couldn't
fucking blue. She's like,

1127
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:31,870
no, he's not violent, I'm not
going to do that. But she was like,

1128
01:05:31,871 --> 01:05:34,900
look at a little favor you in
court, you know, say that, you know,

1129
01:05:34,901 --> 01:05:37,750
say that he was abusive. Say that he
threatened you and you can, you know,

1130
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:41,140
and he likes phrase it in a way
where he wasn't suggesting it.

1131
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:46,290
He was saying one of the best ways to
ensure you know favor with the court is if

1132
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:48,790
your husband was abusive.

1133
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,900
Has he been abusive as he ever
said anything violent to you?

1134
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:57,340
You know [inaudible] like and she's
like, are you insinuating? He's like,

1135
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:00,100
well I'm just saying that if
you did that and she's like,

1136
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:04,510
stop and I'm not going to do, have you,
have you seen that movie gone girl? Yes.

1137
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:08,380
Holy Shit. That was kind of a good example
of that whole little bit good. Maybe.

1138
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:11,680
Fuck Yeah Dude, you haven't seen it
now cause it seems like a chick flick.

1139
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:15,420
It seems like it. It's,
it's weird. It's it.

1140
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:16,760
I can't get past the hall.

1141
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:22,690
It's the opposite of a chick flight.
Well it is. It's to me. I Dunno.

1142
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,770
I have my own take.

1143
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:27,700
I can't watch too much shit out of holiday
without seeing that the fucking angry

1144
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:32,540
feminists head raring. It's fucking face
and everything. Yes. It was just an x.

1145
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,780
Do you see a much hate
if you listen to the,

1146
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,890
there was an unbelievably well written,
but yeah,

1147
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,890
but that's a hateful
woman who wrote that Shit.

1148
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,570
She hates men with a fucking patch,

1149
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,880
but then they can justify it
at the end by going, well,

1150
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:47,080
the woman's the crazy bitch in the movie.
That's what they do. Or alert. Listen,

1151
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:49,480
don't say any more because people,
if you haven't seen that movie,

1152
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:52,280
it's good fucking mood.
What happens in the end? No,

1153
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,850
I've watched it in a hope
to get out and it ready.

1154
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,680
I watched it in a hotel room in Vegas.

1155
01:06:56,950 --> 01:07:00,100
I was just like fucking by
myself and I was like, Eh,

1156
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:02,200
I don't want to go to bed and
see what's on TV. He was like,

1157
01:07:02,201 --> 01:07:04,660
one o'clock in the morning,
I'm gonna Watch this till I fell asleep.

1158
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,770
10 minutes in them fucking white
knuckle and the pill. What the

1159
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,500
fuck? Yeah. But it was
so slick on and I was,

1160
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,970
the dialogue is so slick and I'm like,
people really talk like that, but,

1161
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:20,540
but the venom and the hatred towards men,
that's what I was getting out of it. I,

1162
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:24,850
this woman had you listening,
you have to sleep in a hotel room.

1163
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:28,300
I had two pots of coffee. Me, I was
sitting a foot from the TV yelling at it.

1164
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,480
Go on. This broad is vicious.
Well but it was really,

1165
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,980
really mean and well written and she's
got books out. Her last name is Flynn.

1166
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:40,540
Apparently the book is really good.
Apparently the bullet is more complex.

1167
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:43,870
It's more of like a murder mystery.
Whereas in the movie,

1168
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:46,540
you know they're condensing it down to
two hours or whatever the hell it was.

1169
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:51,260
But he didn't see like it the
way she was categorizing guys.

1170
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,293
You know,

1171
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:56,590
his idea of a fantasy would be a fucking
no reality show marathon and with his

1172
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:58,440
hand down his pants,
you haven't said Shit like that.

1173
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:01,600
I bought a woman and a fucking bold
please it drill yet of Hollywood

1174
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:08,710
and all. But I just felt like they
were telling a story and you know,

1175
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:12,310
given the scenario without telling what
the movie's about, it totally made sense.

1176
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:16,490
I mean, you know, it makes sense,
but it's also coming from, you know,

1177
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,550
it's a woman writing that shit down.
It's coming out of her filthy hope

1178
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:24,740
and a, and if a guy ever
did the equivalent, you
couldn't get the movie made,

1179
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:27,260
it wouldn't get green lit. I'm
just saying, I want to quality.

1180
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,060
If you're going to be
a fucking Douche bag,

1181
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:31,400
I want the right to be a Douche
bag back. Well, it used to be,

1182
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:33,310
they used to be a horse.
Mack woman and movies,

1183
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:38,360
Cary grant movies and shit happened in
real life. Mac. Well, how about, you know,

1184
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:42,710
who were the, uh, uh, who sticks the
grapefruit, his wife's face? Archie bunker

1185
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:48,260
who sticks a grapefruit as well
as whole movie. Yes. I'm huck.

1186
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:52,370
You can't believe I'm going. I'm going.
I'm talking about the caffeine. Yeah.

1187
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:57,350
Don't hurt your eyes. Um,
Cagney James Cagney. Oh really?

1188
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:57,861
Yeah.
He goes,

1189
01:08:57,861 --> 01:09:00,710
I wish you were a wishing well and
you'd fucking sink or somebody sticks a

1190
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:04,040
grapefruit. His wife's face at
the kitchen table. It's beautiful.

1191
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:09,660
I played on a loop, but
it would be, I mean,

1192
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,500
I wish you, you know, it's, it's
going too far the other way now.

1193
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,280
It's all you could smack women in the
face and they would kiss you afterwards.

1194
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:18,310
That was, those days were
different. What was it?

1195
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,940
Who's going on back then where you could
just smack women was zero line like

1196
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,300
dumb and beating Bartow county.
Is that what was going on? Yeah,

1197
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:29,060
the blood into this feminist horse shit.
They're going to to follow themselves.

1198
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:31,580
Yeah, but I mean, why was the guy
hitting her in the first place?

1199
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:35,240
How about just have a conversation? Burnt
his eggs? I mean, come on, let's be, no,

1200
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:38,900
I don't know.
Of course Guy Nicholas,

1201
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,170
how dare you. Oh my
God. This is horrendous.

1202
01:09:42,171 --> 01:09:44,960
You're going to come after you
and Nick Dipaolo the feminists.

1203
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:47,950
They're not going to come to your shows
anymore. No, exactly as I would hope.

1204
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:52,940
They started picketing.
Great. He'll go down.

1205
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:57,120
Wish she'd stop again. Watching. Hi.

1206
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:01,140
We're here with emotion. Well, can
I tie a buck at the end? Thank you.

1207
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:05,930
Whoa.
Maybe found someone you like better.

1208
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:15,150
Oh Shit. Oh my God.

1209
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,320
That's all she said is maybe you
found someone you liked better.

1210
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:21,810
That was fucking palms
are in the face of it.

1211
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:25,710
That was hard for the actual realize.
I didn't realize it was that hard either.

1212
01:10:25,711 --> 01:10:29,610
You know where I saw that on the soprano's
Tony Soprano's watching that movie at

1213
01:10:29,611 --> 01:10:32,610
home. I think it's public
enemy or something and uh,

1214
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:35,490
that's where I first saw that and I go,
Holy Shit. How'd they get away with it?

1215
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:40,440
Jesus Christ. Look at his
face kind of. Well, it's like,

1216
01:10:40,441 --> 01:10:43,050
you know who I go, Ooh. Slapped.

1217
01:10:43,051 --> 01:10:45,960
You know who wouldn't it
godfather across the face. Yeah.

1218
01:10:45,961 --> 01:10:49,270
That was like a palm strike.
Yeah. That was crazy. Yeah.

1219
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,960
That was not just like a most of the face.
He had some like some snap to it.

1220
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:57,730
It was the heel of the hand. Yeah, that
hurts. I'm going to show a different take.

1221
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:02,070
That really did look rough for them.
The one I remember, I kick that bad.

1222
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:06,300
That was horrible.
I'm with you on that one.

1223
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:10,470
He was a real quick, all she said
was maybe a final time. I'm better.

1224
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:12,910
I'm only have files on your right.

1225
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,710
Yeah. She's being fairly reasonable.
Yeah. She wasn't even screaming. See,

1226
01:11:18,711 --> 01:11:22,050
but that's just it. 10 years ago. You
probably saw that and was like, yeah,

1227
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:23,040
that she deserved it,

1228
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,700
but we're all getting the side
in the last 10 DXC years ago,

1229
01:11:26,701 --> 01:11:29,590
Brian Movies from 50 fucking years.
That's a long time ago.

1230
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,600
More than 50 years ago.
That movies from like the 50s right?

1231
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,700
Wasn't that maybe even maybe even 40 yeah.
Well,

1232
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,690
James Cagney public enemy,

1233
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,470
I don't even know if that's
public and girls always had that,

1234
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:48,120
that old school hair, that old school.
That way we like that Fay ray had,

1235
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:50,540
when king cotton picked her up,
right.

1236
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:54,780
That was before flat irons and they also
had like fluffy shit around the end of

1237
01:11:54,781 --> 01:11:58,440
their sleeves. Like that was super
common. Keys fisting a poodle.

1238
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,080
Give your wife showed up at the dinner
table and she was wearing a shirt like

1239
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:03,990
that. You'd be like, what the fuck
are you wearing? That? Sure, sure.

1240
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:07,950
How about his pajamas? It's what
John are. Excellent cap guy.

1241
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:11,370
Mike Brady snapping.
It's like what?

1242
01:12:11,371 --> 01:12:13,180
You were in jail when you
breaking rocks with a hammer.

1243
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:20,340
1931 public enemy. 1931 yeah. Oh my God.

1244
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:22,770
I think that was it. I think
that's public enemy. Yeah.

1245
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:27,720
Social media back then was a newspaper.
I mean there was no one, you know,

1246
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:32,520
social media between people. Shit. There
was nothing. Nobody had a voice back then,

1247
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,350
you know, and a nice, it was quiet.

1248
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:39,440
But it's interesting because you could
kind of could shape society with movies

1249
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:42,770
like a movie like that where you
see James Cagney hit a chicken,

1250
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,310
the face with a grapefruit.

1251
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,580
That would be imitated by people
who went to see that movie. Yeah.

1252
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,790
You don't think that happens now
godfather? Oh yeah, it definitely does.

1253
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:54,330
But at least now you have like people
that counter that like this is horse shit.

1254
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:59,040
This, this gone girl was fucking feminist
tropes. Bullshit. You know? Or this,

1255
01:12:59,041 --> 01:12:59,960
this gone grows.

1256
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,980
It shows you the know the misogynistic
patriarchal society that we looked at

1257
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:07,860
because arguments, people can have their
own sites and debate it. Back then,

1258
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:08,910
you know,
you watched it,

1259
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:12,060
chick got hit with a grapefruit
and then you went home and you hit,

1260
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:15,690
your wife had a great fruit. Now
you hit her with a Panini. I mean,

1261
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,510
how many people have watched movies
and thought that's how to behave?

1262
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,820
I saw this in a movie, so
this is what you do. I mean,

1263
01:13:20,821 --> 01:13:23,380
it's gotta be pretty fucking comment.
Well,

1264
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,210
just look at all the Scarface tee shirt,
Scarface.

1265
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:29,760
How many he has a role model.
Huh?

1266
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:35,060
Is there ever been a fucking movie where
a guy was like more of an anti hero

1267
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,440
that became like a Jew?

1268
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:41,480
Never write a drug dealer murderer was
coked out of his fucking mind became like

1269
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:45,840
an iconic cultural figure. No. I know it
says something about where we're headed,

1270
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:50,220
but everybody loved that movie. I fucking
loved that movie and I didn't love him.

1271
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,860
I wouldn't wear them fucking get my
kid a tee shirt with his face on it.

1272
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:56,730
But yeah, that's crazy. You see little
five year old kid with a scarf or a shirt.

1273
01:13:56,731 --> 01:14:01,220
You're like, what? Kids? Like,
where's the fucking face patient?

1274
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:05,940
Their money. Then you'll get the
power. Then you'll get the push

1275
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:12,730
to that bad guy leaving
the restaurant like shit,

1276
01:14:12,731 --> 01:14:16,750
I know Joe was doing a breath. I'm
putting mine away. That was embarrassed.

1277
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,960
I was a good fucking movie. It was
a good fucking movie. How about me?

1278
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:23,560
When I go to see that,
I go to see at the date came out and uh,

1279
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:26,260
so it was really crowded at the theater
and this is my hometown and Danvers.

1280
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,930
I sneaked down by the,
by the ropes,

1281
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,680
waiting for the doors to open so I can
run in and sit in the front of the next

1282
01:14:31,681 --> 01:14:35,650
showing the door is open. What do
I see him falling in the pool? Oh,

1283
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,850
I just went into denial.
I'm like, that's not him.

1284
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,370
That was just probably some side
character that's not, didn't know.

1285
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,450
That's what I saw. That's terrible.
That ruins everything. Spoiler alert.

1286
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:50,580
I'm happy. Double spoiled.
That's a fucking spoiler.

1287
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,310
Rowanda was one,

1288
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:56,650
but he became a weird guy and they're
like later in his movies he became like

1289
01:14:56,651 --> 01:15:01,390
this real overact kind of tied
to big, too big. Like where like,

1290
01:15:01,391 --> 01:15:04,480
you know, it just didn't,
didn't matter like he was,

1291
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:07,600
it was like always like just trying to
sell shit material or something like that.

1292
01:15:07,601 --> 01:15:12,040
I just wasn't good anymore. But you
go back to back to dog day, afternoon.

1293
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:16,150
You know how fucking good was he? That was
a movie about a transgender Guy, right?

1294
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,500
Who's got to try and get money for his
friend to get a section. That's right.

1295
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:23,420
They were robbing a bank and it wasn't
based on true story. I don't think so.

1296
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:26,830
I think so.
That was a great fucking Larry with,

1297
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,940
he was fucking good back
then. God Damn, he was good.

1298
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:37,690
It's a Kim and I watched some
fucking trailer for a movie.

1299
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:39,040
I almost watched it for a goof.

1300
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:43,870
It was Deniro and Matt
Travolta. No, that was,

1301
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:48,400
that was terrible. That was kind
of cute. Oh good Lord Kenny.

1302
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:52,700
I really did. I bet you
did. Worse than that farm.

1303
01:15:52,701 --> 01:15:57,701
Worse than that was a deniro and Travolta
Travolta plays a Russian hitman and

1304
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:02,800
deniros like fucking CIA guy.
It was one word. Oh my God.

1305
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:06,640
He's the worst fucking trailer. Like
you watched the trailer and you're like,

1306
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:11,290
who green lit this horrible piece of
shit that I'm watching here. Yeah.

1307
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:12,550
And it doesn't,
what happens when the,

1308
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:16,320
when the two characters in the movie of
that famous that you're watching Dinair

1309
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:20,970
we'll chase. Yeah. Travolta. You're
not watching a Russian guy chip. Yeah,

1310
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:25,090
me with a shitty Russian accent.
Terrible killing season. Oh, it's so bad.

1311
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:29,350
But like Deniro over the last few years
it seems like they just give him movies

1312
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:33,970
and he's like, oh, I don't do that.
Fuck it. Pay My fee. I'll fucking do it.

1313
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:38,020
Yeah. Even that poster looks bad for
that. Maybe like, oh, that's so bad. Dude.

1314
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:41,980
It's so bad.
I would say the Amish beard,

1315
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:45,580
I would say play the Empty Ami.
I would say play the trailer,

1316
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:48,100
but we'll definitely get kicked off
of youtube for that fucking trailer.

1317
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:50,980
That puts us in hunting and central park.
Is that each other?

1318
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:57,040
It's such a bad movie. You remember
when uh, Deniro did that movie with um,

1319
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:59,650
the like he did like a fantasy movie,

1320
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:03,040
like one of those fucking wizards
source for a movie with, um,

1321
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:07,060
what the hell is her name?
I'm the chick from

1322
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,030
the two other though the

1323
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,090
Sharon Stone.
It was,

1324
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:15,800
I think it was her and Sharon Stone and
Deniro and some awful fucking Unicorn

1325
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:16,700
wizard movie.

1326
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:22,100
While was that movie that
was called paycheck? It was,

1327
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,320
I mean,
what is he spending his money on?

1328
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,260
How much money is that guy have heat will.

1329
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:32,350
It's funny because not as much as you
think because there was a whole article a

1330
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:35,840
few years ago about him having
money problems. Really? Yeah,

1331
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,210
he and he just bought a bunch
of property upstate New York and

1332
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:43,530
it is started the US look at it as,
fuck. I don't even remember that.

1333
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:44,910
He's a wizard or something.

1334
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:50,490
I don't even remember that kind
of 7.7 and IMD be fuck you.

1335
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:51,340
I am DB.

1336
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:56,100
Find out what's showgirls
has on item 9.7 that's,

1337
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,143
that's a legitimate right.

1338
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:01,700
Good movie because it's so bad. Which
one? Show showgirls. Yeah. Legitimately.

1339
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,770
What was her name like chicken.
Elizabeth spoke 4.5 that's it.

1340
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:07,850
Outrageous.
That's about right.

1341
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:13,080
But how does that one have a 7.7 that's
7.7 is almost fucking eight you know,

1342
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:18,690
eight is almost nine. Nine is almost
perfect. Right? That's horse shit.

1343
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:24,550
That's stupid. Train
movies. 95% on rotten. What?

1344
01:18:24,551 --> 01:18:28,450
Train movie as Snow Piercer. Oh
yeah. That doesn't make any sense.

1345
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:31,960
Did you see that thing Snowpiercer?
No. It's one of those indie movies.

1346
01:18:31,961 --> 01:18:34,960
People like movies that were made for
like 50 bucks when they find out movies

1347
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:37,150
were made cheap and it was made in house.
Oh,

1348
01:18:37,151 --> 01:18:40,240
these guys made it and you know they,
they all got together. They chipped in,

1349
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,140
they started, they got a Kickstarter.
Everybody gets real excited. They did it.

1350
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,100
Marin's garage

1351
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:50,640
where he does his podcast while he was
doing it. Then we took behind them.

1352
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:56,590
Yeah. It will say they do it in
the background. I don't know.

1353
01:18:56,591 --> 01:18:58,030
I didn't even know about this movie.

1354
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:01,120
What did you know that there
was a sequel to whatever.

1355
01:19:01,121 --> 01:19:04,720
That one is called little Fockers
where it's just the little bases.

1356
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:10,940
That's right.
What the fuck are you serious Hoffman?

1357
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:15,610
He did meet the Fockers movies. He's been
cashing in. He really has. You're right.

1358
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,270
It wasn't bad in the first one
though. The first one wasn't that? No,

1359
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,760
that was funny. Yeah. It's
actually pretty funny. But he's,

1360
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,120
what was the movie he played?
There was a fuck.

1361
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,660
Um, it was a movie that
Deniro did. Resa. Goddamn,

1362
01:19:28,661 --> 01:19:33,490
and I've got to go to the Deniros
IMD last Vegas. The family. Oh,

1363
01:19:33,491 --> 01:19:37,330
the family wedding. Silver linings
playbook. No, no, no. There was a good,

1364
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:40,390
it was actually a fairly decent
fucking movie. Limitless.

1365
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,070
He played practical magic.

1366
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:48,580
He played some mob guy and um,
that's it. The one he said,

1367
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:52,660
the family family.
I think it's that.

1368
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,830
I think that's it. The Good Shepherd
family. The family was the family.

1369
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:01,930
It's kind of a spoof on the
mob. No, it was a spoof. Fuck.

1370
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:07,330
God dammit. How'd the Godfather,
I'm not going to know this. Mm.

1371
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:08,000
Not Women

1372
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,240
List. Not killer elite. Not being
freelancers now. Big Wedding.

1373
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:15,810
No killing seat. No. That was the one
we just talked about. Who Cop land,

1374
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,890
which was an American house. What
the fuck was American hustle? Oh,

1375
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:23,190
it was American hustle was in American
hustle. Louie was in that, yeah.

1376
01:20:23,191 --> 01:20:27,390
He was in American hustle to narrow
was, yes. Yes. He was good in that.

1377
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:29,790
I forget.
He was good in that movie.

1378
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,530
They were trying to set
somebody up and um, he,

1379
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:40,130
he happened to know a Arabic and the
guy was playing like a fake Arab.

1380
01:20:40,131 --> 01:20:44,160
There was an undercover cop was
playing a fake Arab. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1381
01:20:44,161 --> 01:20:47,550
He was actually good in that.
It's like one of the rare American hustle.

1382
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:51,900
That was a good, okay. That
movie has 7.3 American hustle,

1383
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:54,870
which was a great movie.
7.3,

1384
01:20:54,871 --> 01:20:58,600
those fucking twats they're playing
with our emotions and I never saw it.

1385
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,340
How does that have a 7.3 in the,
it's a good fucking movie.

1386
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:07,010
American hustle is like an eight or a
nine. It's a really good movie. And a,

1387
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,860
what's her name? Jennifer Lawrence. Oh,
good Lord. She's hot and that movie. Yeah,

1388
01:21:10,861 --> 01:21:15,780
that was a good place. What a good
kid she is, Huh? What a good kid.

1389
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:20,710
Good kid. Uh, goods coming
out of that leak. Uh, I don't,

1390
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,860
I don't have any problem with that
beautiful girl, but yeah, I mean that's a,

1391
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:28,010
that's one of the rare movies that
he's done over the last few years.

1392
01:21:28,011 --> 01:21:31,920
It was actually good, but that's what
happens, man. That's a weird world.

1393
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:35,850
Do you know that world of the aging
older actor guy who used to be the iconic

1394
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:40,610
movie? There he is. Yeah. He played
some fucking God, I forgot about that.

1395
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,920
That's right. That's right. He
was good in it too. It was scary.

1396
01:21:43,921 --> 01:21:46,110
He was legitimately scary.
You give him a good role,

1397
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:48,570
he could still knock it out
of the park. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1398
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,520
He's an act that that
a bar. Yeah. It's just,

1399
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:55,670
I guess it's like not that many good
roles for a guy like that or you know,

1400
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,270
they'd go, hey, we've got this movie.
It's independent. Is it stopped click B?

1401
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:06,900
That's right. Yeah. He's like,
listen, this is Andy, my ass.
Dinero for Christ's sake.

1402
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:09,960
I got a mortgage. But you mentioned,
it's funny. That's an interesting thing,

1403
01:22:09,961 --> 01:22:11,340
but real successful,

1404
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:14,700
famous act as and they get older
and then there's a movie right now,

1405
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:18,240
right with Michael Keaton
about that very thing.

1406
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:21,120
You just see that z birdman yet
I heard it's really good. Good.

1407
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:25,890
Find out what that has on IMD.
Be fucking shitbag few website.

1408
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,490
Yeah, it's those guys, man,
they get to a certain age.

1409
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:33,560
It's like there's not a lot of roles
and women it's way worse because women

1410
01:22:33,561 --> 01:22:38,310
aren't even scary. 8.7
damn. Birdman respect.

1411
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:43,230
Yeah. Um, like a woman like, like Faye
Dunaway, they get to a certain age,

1412
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:47,550
good fucking luck. Tro He got
wasn't a double standard. Yeah.

1413
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:51,380
Especially if it's money, you know, it's
like a, like a big money movie. Like the,

1414
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:54,510
you know,
she was on major league movie star,

1415
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,720
probably making ridiculous amounts
of money at that time in her day.

1416
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,200
And then you get to a certain Angela,
hey, we've got nothing for you. You know,

1417
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:04,140
you want to work. Like Robin Williams
was talking about that before he died.

1418
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,880
He was talking about why he went back
to television and they were saying,

1419
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,120
you know, just like there's
no money. Like, you know,

1420
01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:13,120
he was in his sixties and people were
coming to them with these roles that,

1421
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,290
you know,
weren't that interesting.

1422
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:17,830
Or if they were interesting
was an independent movies,
there's no money involved.

1423
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,850
And then he started doing standup
again. Remember? He did a special, yeah.

1424
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:22,750
But standups,

1425
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:26,050
one of those things you can't fucking
take a decade off and then give

1426
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:30,660
back in the saddle. I think a week on
week off. Exactly. Isn't weird like that.

1427
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,840
Absolutely. It's, it's, you know, it's,

1428
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:38,160
it's a muscle stand up had said
atrophies very quickly and not out there

1429
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,360
chopping away at it.

1430
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:42,250
Yeah. I remember I got knee surgery
once. I had to take a few weeks off,

1431
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:43,210
took like three weeks off.

1432
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:46,720
I had my ACL reconstructed and I went
back on stairs and I was nervous as fuck.

1433
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:47,440
I was like,

1434
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,570
I know, isn't it weird?
That's how you know,

1435
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:53,500
it's still a scary thing
to do for a living because
when you've been doing it 26

1436
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:57,940
27 years and you're still a little
nervous. Yeah. That's when, you know,

1437
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:02,380
cause this is still fucking kind of a
creepy thing is bring it takes balls.

1438
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,190
You know what I mean?

1439
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:07,780
Especially for me when it gets nerve
wracking is like right now because I just

1440
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:08,920
released a special,
so I have to

1441
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:12,000
station wagon about, put it
away. It's all gone. I know.

1442
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,320
That's where you're at now too.
Right. Absolutely terrifying.

1443
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:19,380
And I don't live in the city. I live
40 miles north of New York City now.

1444
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:22,590
I got to drive in and it's a fucking,
it's 80 miles a night.

1445
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:26,610
It's a real pain in the bottom. It's 11
degrees out. I'm laying my couch trucking,

1446
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:28,500
eaten a slice of pizza,

1447
01:24:28,501 --> 01:24:31,080
and I got 1110 at the seller
and you've got to do three sets.

1448
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,980
I don't buy those days. Well, you
know what I'd do? I'd go to the stand,

1449
01:24:34,981 --> 01:24:38,070
this other club and I do a full half hour.

1450
01:24:38,071 --> 01:24:40,860
They let me do a full house
so I can get something done.

1451
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:45,030
And it really came in handy when I, when
I did this, another senseless killing.

1452
01:24:45,031 --> 01:24:47,410
It nicked yp.com stuff
for me. Yeah, that's real.

1453
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:52,860
Erica stands one of the best
ending a billionaire clubs
out there. Yeah. It's an,

1454
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:55,850
it's an intimate little,
it's a small spot.

1455
01:24:56,130 --> 01:25:00,480
Some nights it's got a really Fifi
field too. It's almost like Fifi. Yeah.

1456
01:25:00,481 --> 01:25:03,180
You don't want a little anything, a
little off color. And they're like, Ooh,

1457
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:07,980
it gets so angry. He'll say some hateful
mean shit. I got fucking liberals.

1458
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:12,800
Yeah, well that's true cause nights
where I'm absolutely wrong, but there's,

1459
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:15,390
but you got to admit, even
Chris Rock said, Oh really?

1460
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,090
He did a whole article how
it's not even fun anymore.

1461
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:22,380
The kids are so PC and they get fucking
Venta and this is coming from a black

1462
01:25:22,381 --> 01:25:24,240
guy. You think he's going to
get in trouble saying anything.

1463
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:25,920
Give me a fucking break.
Colleges,

1464
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:29,070
he was talking about colleges to
stop doing those as long time ago.

1465
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:31,290
My second year in the business I stopped,
don't call

1466
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,120
Barry Katz sent me to Clark University,
which is in Wister.

1467
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:39,600
It's even liberal for
Massachusetts school. Yeah,

1468
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,480
and I did some stuff about Middle East
and ours is something, some kid goes,

1469
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:45,200
what are you going to do a Bush and next
of that I said I just winged it much,

1470
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:49,410
a hateful a boy and shit and it's the
only time I got off early in my life.

1471
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:54,300
They fucking hated me. That
was like, how does it go?

1472
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:57,560
There was like 1991 three
years after I started. I,

1473
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:01,410
I've done a handful sense now
when you do them, they request,

1474
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,040
I'll do them if they request me
and they know what, what's common.

1475
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:05,473
I did one upstate

1476
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,520
cup a couple of years ago,

1477
01:26:06,521 --> 01:26:10,390
upstate New York and it was surprisingly
they were open to anything I was saying.

1478
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:13,510
Yeah. Cause he laid on ponies. You need
to go to a shitty school. That's her.

1479
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,810
That's actually a good point. Yeah. If
you go to Harvard you're fucked. Oh fuck.

1480
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:19,480
I did MIT when we first started,

1481
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,570
but I had TV clean shit and they liked it.
It was really Evie clean. Yeah. Anyway,

1482
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,170
I wasn't saying anything
and they liked it.

1483
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:31,230
Well Nick and I came up in the time just
after Steven Wright had made it does

1484
01:26:31,301 --> 01:26:35,260
this big scramble is like that movie
standup, one standup stood out.

1485
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:37,390
France all need a movie,
great fucking movie.

1486
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,580
It's all about the Boston scene and
it's sort of really accentuates what

1487
01:26:42,581 --> 01:26:47,320
happened in those days because Steven
Wright was such a rare talent that he came

1488
01:26:47,321 --> 01:26:50,860
along and there was all these guys that
had been around before him that were

1489
01:26:50,861 --> 01:26:55,720
just doing it. To be funny. And it was
pure, like there was no going anywhere.

1490
01:26:55,870 --> 01:27:00,870
Like those guys were national
level headliners like Sweeney,

1491
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:07,290
uh, Nox, Gavin, you know,

1492
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:12,620
Kenny, Rodney Clark, all those guys,
Mike Donovan, national level headlines,

1493
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,410
but they never went anywhere.

1494
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:17,410
They all stayed in town because all they
were trying to do is make each other

1495
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:20,740
laugh and like get the respect of
each other and kill the crowds.

1496
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,210
But this fucking guy,

1497
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:25,810
Steven Wright came along and his act was
so unique and so weird that he got on

1498
01:27:25,811 --> 01:27:28,240
television and also needs
is national huge superstar.

1499
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:33,310
And so everybody kind of became
like squeaky clean like TV guy.

1500
01:27:33,311 --> 01:27:36,010
And that's,
we came in right when that was happening.

1501
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,260
You were like a little
bit ahead of me and right,

1502
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:41,770
right when we came in we were like,
why is everybody so how come we can't be,

1503
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:42,880
you can't swear

1504
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:45,310
what's, well I don't remember
Sweeney of a doing that.

1505
01:27:45,311 --> 01:27:48,700
And he thinks when he needed it. No, no,
he just stayed himself. He didn't budge.

1506
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:54,110
I'm not doing it. But he
was already a huge star in,

1507
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:58,570
in Boston, Boston, you know. But, but
that's a good point Steven. Right,

1508
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:01,870
because the guy from the tonight show,
it has happened to be in Boston.

1509
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,710
This is all part of that movie.
When standup stood out, the,

1510
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:07,870
the guy that books a comedian for the
tonight show back in the 70s when Carson

1511
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:09,220
was hosting,
it was the thing to do.

1512
01:28:09,221 --> 01:28:12,730
He was in town looking at schools for
his daughter and he saw the Ding Ho ad in

1513
01:28:12,731 --> 01:28:16,120
the paper and he went to the Ding Hall.
That was where the first comedy club,

1514
01:28:16,121 --> 01:28:19,210
that Chinese restaurant remember.
And so he said, I want to go.

1515
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,500
I'm coming there tomorrow night.

1516
01:28:20,501 --> 01:28:25,060
So they made up a lineup and almost every
comic in Boston went and Steven Wright

1517
01:28:25,061 --> 01:28:27,880
was in that, in the mix. And he's
the only one that didn't do that.

1518
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:31,360
Well when the show was over,
all the comics went up to meet the guy.

1519
01:28:31,361 --> 01:28:33,230
They were trying to shake
hands with him and, and,

1520
01:28:33,231 --> 01:28:35,940
and Steven Wright just left cause he
did so bad. That's what he says in the,

1521
01:28:35,941 --> 01:28:38,200
in the movie,
and he's the one who got the call.

1522
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,590
Wow. Well, he was so unique.
Yes. That fucking act.

1523
01:28:41,591 --> 01:28:44,620
When I used to work at
a fire hydrant factory,

1524
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,170
couldn't park anywhere near the police.

1525
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,830
Isn't that pot material? But
when I hear stuff, I'm like,

1526
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:56,950
that has to be,
we'd material used the best week.

1527
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,680
Do you know? He lived next to
me when I moved, when was in la?

1528
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:02,610
I moved a couple times.

1529
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:06,210
I moved to Sierra Benita here in West
Hollywood and I'm moving to this shitty

1530
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:09,180
building. And the guy goes, and this
is before anybody who knew Mitch was,

1531
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:11,340
or he goes, you're a comedian.
How? I go, yeah. He goes, well,

1532
01:29:11,341 --> 01:29:14,090
this is a standup comedian. He lives
right next to you. And I go, well,

1533
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:17,190
what's his name? He goes, I
don't know, Mitch something,
no, whatever. And I'm like,

1534
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:20,970
I know, I never fucking heard of
them. And then you know about,

1535
01:29:20,971 --> 01:29:23,610
I'd say a month and a half later,
two months later, I'm watching TV.

1536
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,940
I was on the road somewhere and he and
my neighbors on the enlightenment and I

1537
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:29,130
go, this guy's is funny as anybody
I've ever fucking heard in my life.

1538
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:30,120
It's got Scott lives next to me.

1539
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:32,830
And then he did a joke about me
cause I used to bang on as well.

1540
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:37,480
He used to play guitar or his
wife or his girlfriend did.

1541
01:29:37,481 --> 01:29:39,560
They used to have the sing alongs
and shit. Not Bang on the wall.

1542
01:29:39,561 --> 01:29:40,394
Like shut the fuck up.

1543
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:47,260
And I'm in shock. Rob. Yeah. And uh,

1544
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:51,880
so Zoe from the Improv, so we might, yeah,
she was in New York one night. She goes,

1545
01:29:51,881 --> 01:29:55,180
she was there to help Mitch put his, let
him say, she goes, you know, he has a bit,

1546
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:58,780
it says Depaulo on the Napkin
that says Depaulo on a Napkin.

1547
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,900
And that's the bit of I'll evening
banging on the wall and he goes,

1548
01:30:01,901 --> 01:30:03,430
there's no door knob come around to some,

1549
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:08,440
but something about the door opening
and a wall open it. And I love this guy.

1550
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:15,580
I'm trying to watch a football game and
then fucking they're doing singalongs.

1551
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:19,210
Oh, that's hilarious. And a, I
just felt so bad. We, I got them.

1552
01:30:19,211 --> 01:30:22,450
I remember leaving in my case, a Heineken
or something. Oh really? Oh that's cool.

1553
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:25,990
That's funny man. But it
broke my heart. A Guy,

1554
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:30,400
he was a guy that got a development
deal, like great standup, right?

1555
01:30:30,401 --> 01:30:31,234
Killer stand up.

1556
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:34,270
But then they wanted to put him on TV
and put him in the movies and shit.

1557
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:38,980
And it just wasn't his thing.
His thing was doing what he was doing.

1558
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:40,990
But that's the weird thing
about Hollywood and stand up.

1559
01:30:40,991 --> 01:30:43,480
It's just like they take a stand
up, they go, man, that you,

1560
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:47,230
well you need to do is you need a host,
a fucking talk show

1561
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,470
host and they'll give a stand up,

1562
01:30:50,471 --> 01:30:54,850
up talk show or give a standup a sitcom
and give him some fucking canned lines

1563
01:30:54,851 --> 01:30:57,820
and reps. Silly. Right. But he, he did it
for a little while and then it was like,

1564
01:30:57,821 --> 01:31:01,510
fuck this took his development deal
money bought a cabin in big bear.

1565
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:05,200
Is that what he did? I didn't know
that. He lives in fucking big bear man.

1566
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:10,030
He lived way early. I think
she though they still own
it. Right? She still owns it.

1567
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,760
Um, and yeah, he had a cool fucking cabin.

1568
01:31:12,761 --> 01:31:15,310
He would just go to the mountains and
hang out. You know, I was like, Ooh,

1569
01:31:15,311 --> 01:31:19,390
I liked that guy. I live in a world that
seems like comics. We like to do that.

1570
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:23,120
I lived in the woods for a while and I
live in Colorado. I lived in Colorado.

1571
01:31:23,121 --> 01:31:25,720
Yeah. My dog had eaten by mountain
line. My wife got pregnant.

1572
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:31,120
No, I could've killed a mountain
lion and we would have been fine.

1573
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:34,840
I have set that little
fucker up. But uh, the, uh,

1574
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:40,060
eight my dog man, but my wife getting
pregnant, we were at 8,500 feet above,

1575
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:44,420
above boulder, like 3000
feet above boulder and it
was really thin air. And you,

1576
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:48,240
if you're pregnant up there, that's going
to be tough morning sickness is brutal.

1577
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:50,920
It was like she had the flu every day,
so we had to get out of it.

1578
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:55,810
And she did not drive in snow. Well, which
one was it, Joe? It was all the above.

1579
01:31:56,020 --> 01:32:00,000
It was everything. It was, we were
isolated, man. We were in the woods and

1580
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:04,270
one of our neighbors got it. It's his
car eaten by a bear. And when I say,

1581
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:10,030
I mean they the fuck fuck the
mini coupe. Black bear. No bears.

1582
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:14,760
When they smell leather seats, they don't
know that that's not food. So the bear,

1583
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,910
the bear got in. I bet I could find
it. I Bet I could find pictures of it.

1584
01:32:18,911 --> 01:32:23,140
Fascinating. Uh, hold on
bear. I got cloth seats, car.

1585
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:24,190
My car's fine,

1586
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:30,010
Colorado because I saw the
pictures online. I was like,

1587
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:33,370
you gotta be fucking kidding me or scare
the shit out of me and I'd rather get

1588
01:32:33,371 --> 01:32:37,360
eaten by a shark or whatever
the bear thing to me. Yeah.

1589
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:41,020
I went Edison's the legends of the fall.
I can't sleep. I liked eating bears.

1590
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:45,590
I like take good. Get them anymore coyote
problems. Joe With you're a chicken.

1591
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:49,330
I got coyote. Yeah, I've got
24 I used to have 24 chickens.

1592
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:54,570
Now I have 20 fucking does the acid
and raise chickens and fucking Kung Fu

1593
01:32:55,811 --> 01:32:59,830
expert. Fucking crazy
motherfucker. I like experiences.

1594
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:02,830
Nikta [inaudible] I know you do.
Um, I'm just saying, so anyway,

1595
01:33:02,831 --> 01:33:07,630
this fucking bear in our neighborhood
broke into this car and just ate it.

1596
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:12,580
I mean, fucking ate the car. Eight
to seats eight. The dashboard.

1597
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:15,670
I'm trying to find the images.
I can't fucking find them online.

1598
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,870
I should have bookmarked it.

1599
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:20,620
It's the craziest fucking thing you've
ever seen because I would have think that

1600
01:33:20,621 --> 01:33:24,910
a bear would. What's that? Oh
No. That bed when I was in holy,

1601
01:33:24,911 --> 01:33:29,200
Jesus fell off of a trampoline
and Cheney shot and fell.

1602
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:32,720
They tranquilized it and it fell out of
the tree. No. And Landon on trampoline.

1603
01:33:32,721 --> 01:33:36,730
So it just started bouncing. Yeah,
that's true. I saw it. Really?

1604
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:42,100
Is there a video? It'll probably
get us pulled from youtube. Really?

1605
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:46,480
Yeah. There's people that own those
videos. They get make money off the ads.

1606
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:50,230
So if you play them on a podcast, they
put you in copyright. The Xing really?

1607
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:53,590
And it's a pain in the tech
man is a real pain. Anyway,

1608
01:33:53,591 --> 01:33:58,591
this fucking bear just absolutely
completely mauled this guy's car.

1609
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,170
And my wife was freaking out about that
too because the fact that these fucking

1610
01:34:02,171 --> 01:34:06,970
giant animals and they weren't even that
big. They were, they were black bears.

1611
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:09,910
Yeah. That's, what is that
one that did it? What was it,

1612
01:34:09,911 --> 01:34:11,630
a salmon and Terry as this another,
uh,

1613
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:15,190
it happens all the time because of
people and national parks leaving like

1614
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:18,460
sandwiches and their cars and stuff
and that period blood hearts period.

1615
01:34:18,461 --> 01:34:22,120
Blood bears are so fucking powerful.
When we went bear hunting,

1616
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:27,300
I was with my friend Cameron Hanes and
we were on the ground maybe 20 feet or 20

1617
01:34:27,971 --> 01:34:30,520
yards rather in front of these
fucking two bears that were fighting.

1618
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:33,400
I wouldn't do,
it was the craziest shit ever.

1619
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:35,800
It was like watching a UFC with bears.

1620
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:39,430
It was a male bear trying to get to
the female and her cubs. The cubs,

1621
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,300
when they see a male bear, they
run up trees. Male bears eat cubs.

1622
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:44,223
It's one of the first things.

1623
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,700
You don't want to be anywhere near
a female bear and her cubs. Exactly.

1624
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:54,450
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Well we
couldn't move once we were there. You.

1625
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:57,070
Last thing I want to do is run.
You don't even want to back up.

1626
01:34:57,130 --> 01:34:58,190
Not like if I lay down

1627
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:02,710
and it's a big thing about
bears is about, it's about, um,

1628
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:07,260
it's about, um, uh, body language.
If you back up your prey,

1629
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:10,880
you're their dominance. You'll give
them the finger. You have to stand up.

1630
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:14,090
If bears come near you, you have to
stand up and you have to move towards.

1631
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:16,430
You don't play dead.
You have to get up and go like this.

1632
01:35:17,490 --> 01:35:21,350
Are you going to do that? Really? We
did. You have to. If you don't do it,

1633
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:23,360
you get fucking eaten.
And I'm not bullshitting.

1634
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:27,440
They ate a kid in Rutgers just I know
the Indian kid and then I made a joke

1635
01:35:27,441 --> 01:35:31,150
about a shitting in the woods. Well,
he does now. He Ate Indian. Oh,

1636
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:36,950
how dare you. Spicy Curry. That kid
took pictures too. You saw the pictures?

1637
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:40,400
Yup. Yup. People like to take selfies
with bears. That's my worst nightmare.

1638
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,770
I'd rather a shock or a cramp there.

1639
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:45,800
People have a lot of weird
ideas about what bears are.

1640
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:49,070
They have these ideas that somehow the
bears like these cute little cuddly

1641
01:35:49,071 --> 01:35:52,250
forest creatures that are eating
berries grew up that way. Teddy bears,

1642
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:55,760
we should not give kids a teddy
bear. The teddy bear. True.

1643
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:58,410
Well especially like what would
you do for a Klondike Bar? Yeah,

1644
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:03,560
fucking polar bears and Coca Cola bears.
This is a real fucking coca cola bear.

1645
01:36:03,561 --> 01:36:07,340
That's what they do. Those goddamn
polar bears. All they eat is meat,

1646
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:11,810
deer or something like that.
Now how does he get the blood off his for?

1647
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:14,890
He doesn't go swimming. We'd
go to the cleaners. Gab,

1648
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:21,650
he swims or you just walked around with
blood all over his face like a fucking

1649
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:24,370
g. He doesn't give a
shit. It wasn't carried.

1650
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:27,320
It looks like he's a polar bear.

1651
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:31,250
There's blood on my coat there had
goddamn terrifying you animals.

1652
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:35,060
We played the video, didn't we have the
guy that was in that big plastic box?

1653
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:40,100
The giant Plexiglass,
some guy from the BBC sets up this box.

1654
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:40,941
That's huge.

1655
01:36:40,941 --> 01:36:45,860
Bulletproof steel reinforced box in
polar bear country and this giant fucking

1656
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:47,870
polar bear comes over and
he's trying to get him.

1657
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:52,790
He's trying to eat the box and
he's huge fucking mouth in this.

1658
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:56,600
Guys inside this box, shit,
his pants shaking the box.

1659
01:36:56,601 --> 01:37:00,020
You realized how strong those
fucking things I, that's like I said,

1660
01:37:00,021 --> 01:37:03,860
I'd rather be in a shark cage. Have you
ever seen the video? I don't think so.

1661
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:07,460
Playing that video. Just play him on
this. Can you play it on that Jamie?

1662
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,430
She's fucking right. You
have to see it. Cause it's,

1663
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:15,020
he's fucking God damn terrifying is
there's so many animals out there that are

1664
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:17,480
just unbelievably powerful and terrifying.

1665
01:37:17,481 --> 01:37:21,590
And we have these ideas about them based
on like cartoons. Oh yeah, he and booboo.

1666
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:26,810
You know like all the like really
scary ones. Like polar bears. Oh,

1667
01:37:26,811 --> 01:37:31,200
how about this pad? Vicious toe. They're
vicious. Yeah. Koala beavers and got,

1668
01:37:31,201 --> 01:37:34,930
got killed by a fucking beaver this year.
But that was an era of disease.

1669
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:42,290
You have a fucking comic to the bone.
The bone.

1670
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:46,920
All right, because at the bear,
no, that's, that's white guy. Oh.

1671
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:50,720
Oh Hey skip ad. See
that button. Click that.

1672
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,860
It goes, look at this, this
fucking guy in this thing.

1673
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:59,280
And if Brian, what is the name of this
for folks who want to watch dumb? Fuck.

1674
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:04,050
It's called starving polar bear.
BBC. We'll bring it up. Oh God.

1675
01:38:04,570 --> 01:38:07,710
So this is Jack Ass decides
he's going to sit in this,

1676
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:09,990
this big glass and you know,

1677
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:14,700
bulletproof glass and steel box and
this bear just goes right to them.

1678
01:38:14,701 --> 01:38:19,170
No fear. Enormous animal.
Probably fucking, you know,

1679
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:23,700
1300 1400 pounds. Who the size
of this fucker? Yeah, that's a,

1680
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:27,510
Oh God damn.
It freaks me out.

1681
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:33,190
Look at the cute little face and then
he's going to bite your head off. No,

1682
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:37,720
just holy Jesus. Well you don't even
know. Wait till he gets up there.

1683
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:41,260
He's just smelling it right now.
He knows there's meat inside there.

1684
01:38:41,261 --> 01:38:44,050
So he starts getting really close
and then he starts trying to bite it.

1685
01:38:44,051 --> 01:38:48,960
Look at this. This is where it gets really
crazy. He starts pushing it. This guy,

1686
01:38:48,961 --> 01:38:53,730
he's tightening down the latches and
you make sure a good time to tighten the

1687
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:57,780
meal. I want to know how they even
test it with the size of that.

1688
01:38:57,781 --> 01:39:00,480
Fuck you gotta be shitting me.
How did they even test this thing?

1689
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:04,470
It's trying to get him, I mean, he's
trying to open that thing up and get him

1690
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:10,143
this guy.

1691
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:15,870
What are the only animals
that actually see us as food?

1692
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:21,410
Yeah. I would want a gun. I
wonder if he's got a gun in there.

1693
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:25,430
You have to have some kind of backup.
Right? Just in case. If it does happen,

1694
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:29,600
I would hope someone who's filming that
from a distance has something like bear

1695
01:39:29,601 --> 01:39:31,880
spray or something.
He'd look at the site,

1696
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:37,280
hope trying to hug him.
He's clawing at the fucking look at that.

1697
01:39:37,310 --> 01:39:41,720
Oh God. Jesus Christ. Yeah,

1698
01:39:41,721 --> 01:39:44,090
because they're not
like even grizzly bears.

1699
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:48,590
They'll eat berries and grass and they'll
lead all sorts of plants, but not,

1700
01:39:48,591 --> 01:39:50,090
and then wash it down with human blood.

1701
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:52,940
Polar bears don't have
anything around except meet.

1702
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:57,130
All they're doing is just eating seals
and the occasional hiker. Yeah. They,

1703
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:59,360
they creep me out more
than I think they should,

1704
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:01,220
but meanwhile I look at this
asshole swimming with one.

1705
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:04,880
The guy who's got his own pet look at
that. Oh yeah. That's fucking jackass.

1706
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:06,650
And I went to school in Maine.

1707
01:40:06,651 --> 01:40:09,950
They had fences up along the campus to
keep the bears off the railing. Yeah,

1708
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:13,190
but those are brought black bears,
right? They're still dangerous.

1709
01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:17,060
Apparently black bears are more likely
to kill people than brown bears.

1710
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:21,110
Just Brown. You just being
racist. Ah, what am I saying?

1711
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,190
Apparently black bears will eat people
more often than a brown bears will. Black,

1712
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:29,690
brown bears are just bigger and stronger.

1713
01:40:30,410 --> 01:40:33,230
Brown bears will avoid you apparently
more than black bears. Well,

1714
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:34,580
yeah,

1715
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:38,380
but New Jersey especially has a real fuck.
I know they got to Reno.

1716
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:41,990
It was just going to, I mean,
I live in Westchester. What's
the difference? And you,

1717
01:40:41,991 --> 01:40:44,530
why'd you move out to Westchester?
What made you want to live out there?

1718
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:48,800
Honest to God, no tunnels and old bridges
on the way into the city. That is nice.

1719
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:53,470
But the property taxes are through the
roof and it's, but I love it. I love it.

1720
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:54,100
Oh yeah.

1721
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,700
It's the worst in the country really.

1722
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:58,540
One of the words were mentioned like
five different articles on the New York

1723
01:40:58,541 --> 01:41:00,250
Times,
but you were in like,

1724
01:41:00,251 --> 01:41:03,850
that's what part of Westchester I'm up
without telling anybody because people

1725
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:08,740
will stalk you up by the,
uh, by like Chappaqua area.

1726
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:12,550
Briar cliff.
I was listening to you on a res podcast.

1727
01:41:12,551 --> 01:41:15,760
He was talking about your neighbor.
Huntsman is falling back yard. Yeah.

1728
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:19,870
Sometimes they'll look out the window
and he'll be like walking through our ag

1729
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:24,850
and a deer blood shit. Love this guy.
Love this guy. Does he bring over meat?

1730
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,230
He gave me a venison roast for
Christmas. Really? Yeah. I love this guy.

1731
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:31,620
I'm not yet.
No,

1732
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:35,800
a couple of days ago they were late
exchanging gifts but uh oh that's cool.

1733
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:39,250
I love that shit. Oh yeah. I
mean, and we have the same thing.

1734
01:41:39,251 --> 01:41:43,990
I got a small dog and we have coyotes
at, you know, let the dog out at night.

1735
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:47,750
You're going to go out and clap and
applaud to keep the willing. Yeah.

1736
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,570
To let the coyotes no,
you there and shit.

1737
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,910
Apparently they say
there's like a certain,

1738
01:41:51,911 --> 01:41:55,840
like things he could set up that make
us sound a certain sound that coyotes

1739
01:41:55,841 --> 01:41:59,410
don't like and you set them up and
they can keep a lot of the coyotes out.

1740
01:41:59,411 --> 01:42:02,680
But they're smart. Those little
fuckers, they, they figure shit out.

1741
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:06,760
They recruited my dog.
That's how I'm really, yeah,

1742
01:42:06,761 --> 01:42:08,650
that's how he got away with
killing one of my chickens.

1743
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:12,640
He became my dog's friend.
Like they go around my dog and you know,

1744
01:42:12,641 --> 01:42:15,310
they would like play I guess
like outside the fence.

1745
01:42:15,311 --> 01:42:18,820
And my dog would bark at them and wag his
tail when he sees them. Oh my God. Yeah.

1746
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:22,510
And when, uh, he killed a
chicken and ran off with my dog,

1747
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:23,770
killed a chicken to my dog,

1748
01:42:23,771 --> 01:42:27,940
had broken into the side of my yard
where the coyote was. Some of the left,

1749
01:42:27,941 --> 01:42:31,200
one of the gates open. We have two gates
and one of the gates you could Kinda,

1750
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:34,030
he could shake it with his paw and he
could open it up and he figured it out.

1751
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:37,730
And so he ran over there to hang out
with his pal and go on a fucking, uh,

1752
01:42:37,731 --> 01:42:39,040
an orgy of slaughter.

1753
01:42:39,550 --> 01:42:43,780
Was it you or whoever Burt or whatever
that said something about the, the,

1754
01:42:43,781 --> 01:42:48,250
the coyote limping that was trying
to trick, uh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1755
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:52,450
That was actually, I'm not even us. That
was a, the [inaudible] scholar. Butters.

1756
01:42:52,451 --> 01:42:52,751
Yeah.

1757
01:42:52,751 --> 01:42:56,020
We were all hanging out in the back of
the comedy store and they were telling us

1758
01:42:56,021 --> 01:42:59,050
that Pete was a PDC.
He,

1759
01:42:59,051 --> 01:43:01,030
I parked up in the hill
behind the comedy store,

1760
01:43:01,031 --> 01:43:03,880
which is a lot of comics do they
part way up in this huge hill,

1761
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:06,820
cause there's like a street that they
can park on and then walk down the hill.

1762
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:09,610
And he said he was getting out of his
car and there was a coyote limping.

1763
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:12,160
That was, he was like, oh my
God, why is this coyote limping?

1764
01:43:12,161 --> 01:43:13,510
And he's just kind of nervous.
He's like,

1765
01:43:13,511 --> 01:43:15,370
I'm just going to let
this coyote walk by me.

1766
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,450
And then suddenly this pack of
coyotes just started walking past him.

1767
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,390
Like I said, they were doing the
exact same thing with the limping.

1768
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:27,490
They set it up where they make it look
like they're hurt and they were like,

1769
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:32,260
well, they'll limp. So it's her job.
She used to do videos to get girls. Yes.

1770
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:35,260
He would pretend he was hurt
or kill his dude. They be,

1771
01:43:35,261 --> 01:43:37,330
can they have a cast on their
arm and they're on crutches?

1772
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:39,850
I remembering the Ted Monday,
I didn't know he did.

1773
01:43:39,851 --> 01:43:41,530
That girl comes over to help him.

1774
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:43,180
He's trying to put a couch
in the back of a van.

1775
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:47,170
He's pretending he's got like a cast on
his hand. The girls kind of salt lamps.

1776
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:50,650
That's like, that's like a,
that's prepay. I didn't know.

1777
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:52,040
I thought that was a human thing.

1778
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,730
I didn't know. I didn't know animals
were doing. They fake a limp. Yeah,

1779
01:43:55,731 --> 01:43:59,780
they fake a limp and they'll also
become friends with your dog and then my

1780
01:43:59,781 --> 01:44:00,440
neighbor,

1781
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:04,280
he has like a beagle little beagle and
he says every time the coyotes come near

1782
01:44:04,281 --> 01:44:06,170
his house,
the beagles starts wagging its tail.

1783
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:09,860
I think it's the coyote is his friend
and if they can get the dog outside and

1784
01:44:09,861 --> 01:44:12,500
they just maul it and kill it,
it did creepy.

1785
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:15,590
Well he thought it was just they
smelled it and fucking attacked it. No,

1786
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:18,120
they're smart man. They
developed tactics. Well you know,

1787
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:21,950
they're similar in a lot of ways to
wolves and wolves have a lot of like crazy

1788
01:44:21,951 --> 01:44:24,290
tricks that they do to uh,
to get animals.

1789
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,320
We'll set up ambushes like wolves will,

1790
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:31,640
they'll funnel like elk and deer until
like a path. And then the weight,

1791
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:35,570
they'll have other wolves waiting.
I don't how the fuck they work this out.

1792
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:37,520
I don't know how they,
the internet

1793
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:41,420
email,

1794
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:45,080
what did they do that lets them figure
out that this is a good strategy and how

1795
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:47,150
do they know like who's
going to be the chaser?

1796
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:50,030
Who's going to be the guy that waits,
you know, how do they coordinate this?

1797
01:44:50,031 --> 01:44:53,360
But I guess when you're fucking starving
and the only way you get food is to

1798
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:57,050
kill it with your face like you,
you work shit out and the streets.

1799
01:44:57,180 --> 01:45:01,730
Martin's why it is kind of street smart.
Think of a crazily fake limping.

1800
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:05,960
I'd, I'd never heard that.
That's unbelievable. They
have a real problem. This one,

1801
01:45:05,961 --> 01:45:08,770
a retirement community,
there's been some insane amount,

1802
01:45:08,771 --> 01:45:11,270
like more than 30 over the last year,
uh,

1803
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:14,690
coyote attacks because they
figured out in Arizona,

1804
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:17,420
they figured out that old
people are fucking old.

1805
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:21,060
You know the Kyries realize this guy's
not gonna stop me from genus dog.

1806
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:24,260
And so they just run up and
snatch dogs right off the leash.

1807
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:28,160
They'll literally wait for someone
to be walking their dog, the weight,

1808
01:45:28,161 --> 01:45:30,080
and they'll see the guy with
the dog and then just run,

1809
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:33,570
run right out half the number of 10
or 11 you wouldn't walk your dog and I

1810
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:34,490
fucking air.
Well,

1811
01:45:34,491 --> 01:45:37,750
especially if you live in fucking
Arizona where you can carry a gun gun,

1812
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:41,810
do whatever you would walk.
Like Arizona is a open carry state.

1813
01:45:41,811 --> 01:45:43,580
You don't even have to have
a concealed carry permit.

1814
01:45:43,581 --> 01:45:46,280
You can do whatever the fuck you want
and you can keep a gun, your underwear,

1815
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:48,910
you do whatever you want.
No helmet and gun on your mouth.

1816
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:53,810
No helmet on the motorcycle and gun
coyotes loved the smell of absorbing Jr.

1817
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:58,180
Just walk your dog by a motorcycle while
you're armed. Yeah, that's it. Just,

1818
01:45:58,350 --> 01:46:00,890
just slowly all over the neighborhood.

1819
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:06,890
Just idle and just start unloading
shotgun shells on these fucking country.

1820
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:11,660
While
I really wish we could get a motorcycle.

1821
01:46:11,661 --> 01:46:15,110
I wish we didn't live in la cause
it's so tempting to give me my money.

1822
01:46:15,111 --> 01:46:17,750
Are we riding together?
Like what do you got planned?

1823
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:21,980
Going to get a side conference.
I get with those goggles on

1824
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,380
because there's so many
people at the comedy store.

1825
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:30,120
They're getting new motorcycles
lately and it's just so like,

1826
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:33,740
and it's not that expensive. I thought
motorcycles where like the price of a car.

1827
01:46:33,741 --> 01:46:37,280
They're not that bad. No, it's not bad at
all. Dean Dean is always a ride in his,

1828
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:40,450
I don't trust del Rey. Yeah.
That's a fucking dope motorcycle.

1829
01:46:40,451 --> 01:46:44,000
He got to that fat Harley Davidson. That
thing's amazing. Police car won yet.

1830
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:47,990
He has a police motorcycle.
Police motorcycle. It's
cool. Oh yeah, they'll load.

1831
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:49,980
It's kind of like sorta police colors.
Yeah.

1832
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,940
With a side car. Side bags on
it that things may, I asked
him about it. I go, dude,

1833
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:56,760
that thing's amazing. I go, do you have
close calls? He goes, all the time.

1834
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,550
I got kids.
Well Louie,

1835
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:04,320
I was living with Louis in New York
right after we moved to different places.

1836
01:47:04,321 --> 01:47:08,610
He got a bike and and sure enough man,
like after, after like three weeks,

1837
01:47:08,611 --> 01:47:13,140
he was doing like 60 down, you
know, by Columbus. So when it goes,

1838
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:19,140
gets hit going through her fucking
intersection, you get t boned.

1839
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:23,190
I mean, could have been killed,
login easily. He got hit hard flying,

1840
01:47:23,191 --> 01:47:25,560
got knocked out.
I almost got a bike.

1841
01:47:25,561 --> 01:47:27,720
I was going through the motorcycle
training thing and everything.

1842
01:47:27,721 --> 01:47:30,390
I was going with a couple friends of
mine and they wound up getting bikes.

1843
01:47:30,391 --> 01:47:33,990
But two people I know gotten some
pretty serious accidents. Uh,

1844
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:35,460
a buddy of mine fell.

1845
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:38,460
He was going through the canyons and
he fell and fucked his shoulder up.

1846
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:42,120
And then another friend,
Frank Mir was the UFC,

1847
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:43,680
one of the UFC champions.

1848
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:46,800
You got hit by a fucking car and
got launched 60 feet in the air.

1849
01:47:46,801 --> 01:47:48,360
Some old man just ran a red light.

1850
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:52,590
So looking to hit the gas and shattered
his femur. That's the thing. It's,

1851
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,890
it's not you, it's the, he
almost lost his leg people,

1852
01:47:55,891 --> 01:47:59,460
the other people drive and they don't
trust. Exactly right. Exactly. I mean,

1853
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,610
crashing your bike if you're
going fast can be fatal for sure.

1854
01:48:02,611 --> 01:48:06,430
But most accidents occur because you're
involved with another vehicle, you know,

1855
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:09,660
unless you're driving like a psycho.
I mean,

1856
01:48:09,661 --> 01:48:11,010
but it's even tempting just to be like,
you know what,

1857
01:48:11,011 --> 01:48:13,170
I'll just drive around my house,
my neighborhood, you know, like,

1858
01:48:13,171 --> 01:48:16,410
I'll just go to the store instead
of doing nothing on the freeway,

1859
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:21,180
I got an alley to go pick up a sandwich.
What's so fun? They are fun. I mean,

1860
01:48:21,181 --> 01:48:24,600
you think about it, you go to, I think
about this when I go, uh, to, uh, like,

1861
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:28,950
like Disneyland with my kids and I'll get
any stupid fucking go karts. I'm like,

1862
01:48:28,951 --> 01:48:32,180
look, you know, I, I gotta
go cart. You know, I got it.

1863
01:48:32,181 --> 01:48:35,550
I got a sports car to drive it fast.
Like this is not that fun for me.

1864
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:36,384
This is stupid.

1865
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:41,570
But like a motorcycle like around your
neighborhood is just like going on a ride

1866
01:48:41,611 --> 01:48:45,240
at Disneyland. You know. If it's
fun to go on a ride at Disneyland,

1867
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:48,540
it's way more fun to be riding around
your neighborhood on a motorcycle.

1868
01:48:48,541 --> 01:48:52,320
It'd be really fun.
Just convince yourself though it Joe.

1869
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:56,100
But what's worse is those guys that I
think feel the same but they get those

1870
01:48:56,101 --> 01:48:59,280
like for motorcycle,
like where it's like a grown man,

1871
01:48:59,310 --> 01:49:03,090
like a white guy with one of those
four wheel motorcycles driving down the

1872
01:49:03,091 --> 01:49:04,920
street. Yeah, they should be. Yeah.

1873
01:49:04,921 --> 01:49:07,920
You should be off in the woods with
that thing and can be in the woods in

1874
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:11,040
Tennessee with that thing.
Checking out your shine.

1875
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:15,780
See if somebody broke into the
hut funding your trap line. Yeah.

1876
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:19,350
Those things get people fucked up.

1877
01:49:19,351 --> 01:49:23,490
You know those for a lot of paralyze
people didn't Ozzy Osborne break his back

1878
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,820
doing one of those problems, they fall
over on you. The problem with those,

1879
01:49:28,110 --> 01:49:31,020
it's different than a motorcycle.
Like if you slide in a motorcycle,

1880
01:49:31,021 --> 01:49:31,711
if you're falling,

1881
01:49:31,711 --> 01:49:35,280
you let the bike slide and you know
you get rug rash or road rash rather.

1882
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:38,760
But on those things, a lot of times people
want them getting trapped under him.

1883
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,550
They get crushed.
There's so goofy looking too though.

1884
01:49:41,551 --> 01:49:44,550
When you see a guy driving down the street
in that though they're real dangerous.

1885
01:49:44,551 --> 01:49:48,070
If you hit a bump, if like you hit a
bump with like your side and you know

1886
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:49,300
it flips over on top of you,

1887
01:49:49,301 --> 01:49:53,110
you might get crushed and know you
might get your body cavity caved in.

1888
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:56,860
Here's trail Ellen.
Yeah. What is he doing?

1889
01:49:56,861 --> 01:50:00,370
He doesn't have a helmet on Jesus Christ.
Let's see Chris.

1890
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,650
That's football injuries,
Goddamn head injuries.

1891
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:06,070
He's had two wheels in the
front and one in the back.

1892
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:08,140
Those are apparently more
stable for some reason.

1893
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:11,830
I don't understand why the hell is that.
That's like one of those things.

1894
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:14,080
They have two wheels in the
front and one in the back.

1895
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,870
I wonder if because it has all those
wheels, you don't need a helmet.

1896
01:50:16,871 --> 01:50:19,570
Is that or is that like in a
place where you need a helmet?

1897
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:23,890
You don't need a helmet. A lot of fucking
states still don't have helmet laws,

1898
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:25,660
you know?

1899
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:29,410
Yeah. It's sunglasses and lie to play
like you have to have sunglasses on,

1900
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:32,750
which is smart. That is the law of
bug or a pebble. I mean, you know,

1901
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,440
pebble hit your windshield
50 miles an hour.

1902
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:38,440
Dean used to always say the worst is
when you're behind somebody and somebody

1903
01:50:38,441 --> 01:50:40,840
flicked a cigarette out and
it'll go right into your coat.

1904
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:43,400
Inner driving and it just like,
you don't know what to do.

1905
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:47,680
He says that happens all the time.
It's cigarette fuck. Rarely. Yeah,

1906
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,720
I see the little marble counter.
How many times can that happen?

1907
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:55,330
I mean it happens all
the time on the road.

1908
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:58,810
I see people throw cigarettes out there.
The car out here all the time.

1909
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:01,660
When the lead man, he used to have a
joke about that. Remember, what was it?

1910
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:03,840
She goes, I don't throw my
cigarettes out the car window.

1911
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:07,860
Cause last time I did the
car behind me blew up. Well,

1912
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:11,040
I always think that it was the
best job that though. Right?

1913
01:51:11,041 --> 01:51:14,260
Like you do somewhere inside your
engine it's going to go on the tank,

1914
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:17,380
get in there and fucking lights.
It's all gasoline and shit.

1915
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:18,401
Well not only that,

1916
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:21,760
in La you have to be a real asshole to
do that cause it only rains once a year.

1917
01:51:21,761 --> 01:51:25,690
Here, everything's dry as fuck.
You know you can start fires.

1918
01:51:25,691 --> 01:51:27,340
They say all those roadside fires,

1919
01:51:27,341 --> 01:51:30,370
they all get started by people flicking
flicking a bunch out the window.

1920
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:32,890
That's pretty sweet.
That is pretty,

1921
01:51:33,850 --> 01:51:35,970
that looks awesome.
Three wheeler duck thing.

1922
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:40,240
It looks like a car tire and it looks
like you could front could be the back in

1923
01:51:40,241 --> 01:51:41,680
the back.
Could be that you could go either way on.

1924
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:47,470
Do you know how many you can lay
down this way? It's a bisexual cycle.

1925
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:53,020
It goes both ways.
It's like corvette size tires.

1926
01:51:53,021 --> 01:51:56,320
Look why those fucking tires are,
that seems like that would be

1927
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:00,740
no, not that stable. Yeah.
I mean I, yes, I mean,

1928
01:52:00,741 --> 01:52:02,480
isn't the idea that you kind of like lean,

1929
01:52:02,930 --> 01:52:07,190
where do you drive that people
drive that shit all through La.

1930
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:10,560
Like I see it all the time. Yeah.
Not this exact one. Is that legal?

1931
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:15,000
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, how
was it? Motorcycle legal. It's weird.

1932
01:52:15,001 --> 01:52:18,230
Like motorcycles illegal, but you have
to, you get a ticket if you have a seat.

1933
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:22,680
No seat belt on.
Like I'm inside a metal box guys.

1934
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:25,530
He's like sitting on
that thing just sitting,

1935
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:27,960
sitting and holding on with his hands.

1936
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,600
You know you could ride a motorcycle
by the way, if you have one hand.

1937
01:52:30,630 --> 01:52:33,240
How about that?
How about you have one hand and a,

1938
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:37,920
you're just sitting on it and I have
two hands inside a box and I can get a

1939
01:52:37,921 --> 01:52:39,480
ticket if I don't have a strap around me.

1940
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:43,770
Another big thing in Burbank
is this legal golf carts.

1941
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:46,160
People just drive shit around era in

1942
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,720
Burbank all the time.

1943
01:52:47,721 --> 01:52:51,140
It was like two or three
people just driving down the
street and golf carts. Boy,

1944
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:55,130
they living on life at a breakneck
pace. Huh? What the fuck? Really? Yeah,

1945
01:52:55,131 --> 01:52:58,760
and there's a lot that's become popular
I think because just the gas mileage,

1946
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:02,420
you know? Well, they're all illegal. I
mean rather, right? They're all electric.

1947
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:05,330
I don't, I don't know this.
Is that the future out of them

1948
01:53:07,190 --> 01:53:10,970
electric carts? Yeah. Well fuck the
spot at all. Give me my pickup truck.

1949
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:13,460
These fucking electric
cars they're making now,

1950
01:53:13,461 --> 01:53:16,460
they're slowly starting to get
better gas mileage or distance.

1951
01:53:16,461 --> 01:53:18,710
So they under $100,000.
No,

1952
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:22,490
they're probably the Tesla's the good
ones. I mean you get like a Prius,

1953
01:53:22,491 --> 01:53:27,110
but those are ugly. That's what I want
to get behind two broads in a golf cart.

1954
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:28,840
I'm late for an audition.

1955
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:33,370
No gears.

1956
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:37,930
Just a s steady buzz and 35 miles
an hour when they're pushing it.

1957
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:42,460
Yeah. They got a new Tesla that goes 400
miles. That's like the newest, latest,

1958
01:53:42,461 --> 01:53:46,600
greatest one. They have a, an upgrade to
their little roads. Dirk was 400 miles,

1959
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:50,350
but that's still not that long,
man. 400 miles on a charge. No.

1960
01:53:50,410 --> 01:53:51,520
Some shit hits the fan.

1961
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:54,200
Isn't that just the guy just
get divorced and now he owes,

1962
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:59,410
he's paying the girl like $20 million or
something like Elon Musk don't prenups

1963
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:03,050
work. Uh, what every be I hear
about a prenup and I'd never worked

1964
01:54:03,370 --> 01:54:04,890
can test them for sure.

1965
01:54:04,891 --> 01:54:08,460
And a lot of times when people can
test prenups or any kind of lawsuit,

1966
01:54:08,670 --> 01:54:11,550
people settle because you took costs like,
yeah.

1967
01:54:11,551 --> 01:54:16,551
Cause of the UFC right now has a Elon
Musk divorce makes it most eligible again.

1968
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:19,320
Okay.
If she has got divorced he would who do

1969
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:24,330
and she were received 16
million. Yeah, she deserves,

1970
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:26,070
because she helped with that company.

1971
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:31,130
She was stuck in that sweet 16
every dog tick Joe. That's sexy.

1972
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,010
That's misogynist.

1973
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:36,350
You're going to get to know I was raised
in the 60s I didn't know any better.

1974
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:39,080
I don't know any better.
When I grew up,

1975
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:42,170
my formative years all occurred before
the Internet and social justice.

1976
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,033
I didn't know

1977
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:48,230
I was raised on James Cagney movies.

1978
01:54:49,110 --> 01:54:51,720
I don't know any better and I wish I could

1979
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:57,090
think about those fucking electric cars
is you've got to get those goddamned

1980
01:54:57,110 --> 01:55:00,770
batteries from somewhere and all that,
all that shit from those batteries.

1981
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:03,830
A lot of it comes from like where
it called conflict minerals.

1982
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:06,270
It's comes from Africa,
comes from like the,

1983
01:55:06,271 --> 01:55:08,610
I'm fucking slaves pulling it
out of the ground. Like that's,

1984
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:12,050
that's the big dirty secret
cell phones. Yeah. Lithium,

1985
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:16,310
lithium ion batteries. A lot of that
shit comes from either Africa or a big,

1986
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:19,380
a big supply they found recently in
Afghanistan. Like they're going to,

1987
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,890
they're going to be
sending people to mind.

1988
01:55:21,891 --> 01:55:24,320
I'm sure a lot of chemicals over there.
Yeah. They, a lot of shit in the ground.

1989
01:55:24,321 --> 01:55:29,300
Minerals, lots of minerals, a
lot of natural gas. No roads,

1990
01:55:29,570 --> 01:55:31,230
no toilet.
Yeah.

1991
01:55:31,231 --> 01:55:35,360
And you know what they say also in
places where electricity is made by coal,

1992
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:39,380
it actually is worse for the environment
to get your electricity to power a car

1993
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:44,010
and then use it with a cold
fat Pi fired, uh, electrical

1994
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,910
plant than it is to just burn gas
because the gas they have now,

1995
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:52,370
like if you have certain, what does
that, Jon Jones has a gas, but no,

1996
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:56,070
what he tests positive
for cocaine enters rehab.

1997
01:55:56,940 --> 01:56:00,770
No Way. That just happened. No,

1998
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:05,610
John John's test positive
for cocaine enters rehab.

1999
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:10,260
Oh my goodness dude. Now
wait a minute. Hold on.

2000
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:13,110
When you do, cause it's going to ask
you that. That was the next question.

2001
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:16,920
I don't think that stays in your
system very long. 30 days, 20 days,

2002
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,980
something like that. It's
very short. Is it that long?

2003
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:23,130
I thought it was like 30 hours
or something crazy like that.

2004
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:24,550
Maybe I'm thinking 30 hours,
but

2005
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:30,240
that's fucked. Let me call
shortly after we fight like that.

2006
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:31,650
I wonder if he loses his title.

2007
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:35,430
Quote from Dana.

2008
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:38,660
I am proud of John Jones from making
the decision to enter a drug retreatment

2009
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:39,780
facility.
He stated,

2010
01:56:39,781 --> 01:56:42,180
I'm confident that he'll emerged
from this program like the champion.

2011
01:56:42,181 --> 01:56:46,560
He truly is. Okay. That's a good thing to
say. I like to talk to him on the phone,

2012
01:56:47,110 --> 01:56:48,310
find out what he really thinks.

2013
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,220
We're going to have an interesting
conversation that I can't talk to people

2014
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:56,880
about it. That's exactly
right. I mean that's great.

2015
01:56:57,430 --> 01:57:01,410
Maybe celebrated the big victory
now I'm hoping. No, no way.

2016
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:05,400
No Way. Cause they test them after
the fight. Like right after the fight.

2017
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:07,600
They test him before the
fight or right after,

2018
01:57:07,610 --> 01:57:11,610
right after December drug test it says,
oh they didn't put the rest of my coat.

2019
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:17,190
So yeah, I wonder what happens
is they tell us is going to be,

2020
01:57:17,191 --> 01:57:20,640
you know what? Come on. I don't
know about that because he won.

2021
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:25,970
I mean it's probably a a non decision
like it's probably like a somehow,

2022
01:57:26,370 --> 01:57:30,180
I don't know. Vacate the belt man.
Yeah, they that cocaine you can't be,

2023
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:32,310
here's how you fix it.
Here's how you fix this.

2024
01:57:32,311 --> 01:57:34,780
So you have a rematch match math
with they both coked up. Yeah.

2025
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:41,340
It's a pretty common that he was doing
blown. He's still one. How about that?

2026
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:44,280
How about Scott? He's, oh,

2027
01:57:44,281 --> 01:57:48,540
he's the most bad ass ever test
positive for cocaine metabolites.

2028
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:51,000
It's brother with the patriot.
Best Pass rusher. They have,

2029
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:55,620
it's a mayor and a couple
of tough mothers. Family
develop some stud athletes.

2030
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:59,940
Did they ever, this is a,
this is really strange man,

2031
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:01,253
that just happened.

2032
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:06,600
This is cold being with the
Rogan when the news breaks.

2033
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:10,160
You're great at that yet I'm not kissing
your ass. Be Really, oh thanks man.

2034
01:58:10,161 --> 01:58:12,720
I was watching like a year ago and it
was some guy getting the shit kicked out

2035
01:58:12,721 --> 01:58:16,290
of him and you go, um, yeah, but
the guys getting a little cocky,

2036
01:58:16,291 --> 01:58:17,850
I don't know who was winning the fight.
He goes,

2037
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:21,690
he's getting a little too cocky and you
didn't even 10 seconds after that he get

2038
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:25,830
the guy get knocked out.
You're the albums. Yeah. Wow.

2039
01:58:25,831 --> 01:58:29,670
This is crazy. This is really crazy. Um,

2040
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Nevada state commission falls the world
antidoping agency code and um hmm.

2041
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:42,770
This, he tested positive for Benzos. Xylem

2042
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:47,510
going nine. The main metabolite
and cocaine. That's the soul.

2043
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:52,750
So by saying that that's
a metabolite and cocaine,

2044
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:55,720
it means what you're talking about,
like really trace shit,

2045
01:58:57,610 --> 01:59:00,760
really trace shit and he's
already gotten busted in a Dui.

2046
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:04,320
What do you mean really trace Josh's
small, very, very small amount

2047
01:59:04,530 --> 01:59:05,200
mounds.

2048
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,033
Well,
get this

2049
01:59:08,270 --> 01:59:12,760
big ups with Jon Jones Body.
Oh Shit,

2050
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:13,623
it's begun.

2051
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:16,860
Starts Wow.
Trace amounts of cocaine.

2052
01:59:16,861 --> 01:59:21,750
I mean he could have just lik
day CD, CD or something. Yeah.

2053
01:59:21,751 --> 01:59:25,220
You could have had money.
Some monies.

2054
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:27,860
Yeah. You got to have some,
they sit in the window sill,

2055
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:31,960
like an x amount of a percentage of
like a hundred dollar bills have money.

2056
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:36,230
Yes. When I worked at a
record store, we would get,

2057
01:59:36,231 --> 01:59:39,710
people would come in to sell their cds
and I just remember I would pick out once

2058
01:59:39,711 --> 01:59:42,710
and it was just white dust over and
I'm like, all right, we'll buy this one

2059
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,100
and he would

2060
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:50,190
scrape them together and we didn't know
what we're doing. We were just like, dude,

2061
01:59:50,191 --> 01:59:54,760
it has to be okay. What other white
shit would be on a CD and Hilkiah.

2062
01:59:54,990 --> 01:59:55,440
Right.

2063
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:59,080
Wow. Yeah. Maybe they would get like
people that are like blondie fan.

2064
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:03,430
They want it to die. It was just sell
them. She showing tits in her video.

2065
02:00:08,220 --> 02:00:12,240
Well, I am proud of that Mr. Jones
is addressing the issue. Oh, okay.

2066
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:15,870
Friends bow.
Yeah.

2067
02:00:16,690 --> 02:00:18,940
Well he got tested December 4th okay.

2068
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:23,440
That's a almost a month before
with the support of my family.

2069
02:00:23,441 --> 02:00:27,330
I've entered into drug treatment facility.
I want to apologize to my fiance,

2070
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:28,600
my children as well,
my mother,

2071
02:00:28,601 --> 02:00:30,400
father and my brothers
making a mistake that I made.

2072
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:32,800
I also want to apologize
to Yossi my coaches.

2073
02:00:32,801 --> 02:00:34,720
My sponsor's equally pointing my fans.

2074
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:37,300
I am taking this treatment
program very seriously.

2075
02:00:37,301 --> 02:00:41,110
Therefore at this time my family
and I would appreciate privacy. Hmm.

2076
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:45,640
And Bet you what? Well you know what man?
The dude is having a good fucking time.

2077
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,630
That's what's going on. He's the
baddest motherfucker on the planet.

2078
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:53,680
He's partying up a storm. Like someone
said something to me like, you know,

2079
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:57,670
all those crazy behavior and all this
wild shit that he's doing. And I was like,

2080
02:00:57,671 --> 02:01:01,980
listen, you got to be a wild
motherfucker to be to do that.

2081
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:04,090
Your baddest dude on the planet,
you really do.

2082
02:01:04,450 --> 02:01:07,900
And John Jones essentially when it comes
to MMA is the baddest motherfucker on

2083
02:01:07,901 --> 02:01:09,070
the planet.
I mean,

2084
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:14,370
he just beat Daniel Cormier who was a
Strikeforce Grand Prix champion who trains

2085
02:01:14,831 --> 02:01:19,090
on a regular basis, holds his own with
the heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez.

2086
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:20,080
He said,
you know,

2087
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:23,350
in a heartbeat he would fight
the heavyweight champion
and he might be able to

2088
02:01:23,351 --> 02:01:24,910
beat a man who the fuck knows.
I mean,

2089
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:28,330
he might be a better fighter if he wasn't
losing weight to get down to two oh

2090
02:01:28,331 --> 02:01:30,040
five and doing coke

2091
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:34,450
202 to four days. It's why does it last
in the system? Yeah. Okay. So that means,

2092
02:01:35,110 --> 02:01:36,630
so if we look at his two,

2093
02:01:36,670 --> 02:01:41,670
we look at John Jones Twitter on December
1st or December or November 29th we'll

2094
02:01:42,531 --> 02:01:45,710
see exactly where he's like, you know,
hanging out where he was on the boat.

2095
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:50,560
It was, how could the cop over there
fucking this fucking very clever.

2096
02:01:50,561 --> 02:01:54,580
He's just Christ. Take it easy
there, right? Yeah. Thank you.

2097
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:58,160
Quincy.
You and I just hope dated each other.

2098
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:02,480
Might as well have said Sherlock Holmes.
Charlie

2099
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:06,800
has a hardy party boys.

2100
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:14,290
Oh my God. I was trying to think
of a Goddamn detective division.

2101
02:02:14,291 --> 02:02:17,230
Can imagine it. Really.
It's fucking sad, Joe. Okay,

2102
02:02:17,231 --> 02:02:20,470
let's go to John Jones Twitter
page December. Okay, that's fine.

2103
02:02:20,471 --> 02:02:23,500
John Jones cut to him with his
face in a pair of stripper did.

2104
02:02:23,950 --> 02:02:27,690
Yeah. Jones. All right.
What do you think? December.

2105
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:29,480
How far back you gotta go?

2106
02:02:29,950 --> 02:02:33,400
So I'm so December, wait, the test
was December 4th is that what it said?

2107
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:36,280
So I would say I would
go December 2nd or first.

2108
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:40,240
Oh, we try now. Let's go deep. Let's
go deep into the honey hole. All right.

2109
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:43,610
December 20th two two two,
two, two tweets a lot. Okay.

2110
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:45,550
He just got back from Brazil,
came over.

2111
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:50,890
Cause now it says by Brazil sky
just figured the whole thing.

2112
02:02:50,891 --> 02:02:55,630
Oh, the Brian. Yup. Holy
Shit. That's how it happened.

2113
02:02:56,950 --> 02:02:59,380
Yeah. And, and you know what,
because it's trace amounts,

2114
02:02:59,410 --> 02:03:03,250
I will bet you that it was probably
something that's common that he maybe he

2115
02:03:03,251 --> 02:03:06,670
went to a restaurant and they had like
a coca leaf or there was some kind of

2116
02:03:06,671 --> 02:03:09,100
weird like thing, well, I'm going
to throw another theory that,

2117
02:03:09,101 --> 02:03:12,270
how about when a call me, his people was
over there and sprinkled in here, right?

2118
02:03:12,570 --> 02:03:16,190
Oh well we're Vember 30th
that's real thinking.

2119
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:21,940
So he got tested on November
4th December four date,

2120
02:03:21,970 --> 02:03:26,050
December 4th rather. So he has four days
for it to get. Yeah, about four days.

2121
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:29,980
I'm going to start doing that shit
again. Yeah, I didn't know that either.

2122
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:33,780
It looks like is the most
likely culprit. Absolutely. Boy,

2123
02:03:33,781 --> 02:03:37,900
you guys put that together really quick.
The time partying up a storm. Yeah.

2124
02:03:37,901 --> 02:03:41,560
Here's the actual quote he says by Brazil.
Thank you so much for the great time.

2125
02:03:41,561 --> 02:03:44,500
Now back to the bootcamp
and that was November 30th

2126
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:48,210
hmm. Yup. And there's a trail of
blood going up. The plain stuff.

2127
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:54,730
What it is, the little
sprinkles on his Reebok's. Wow.

2128
02:03:55,090 --> 02:03:56,650
Why laces bloody what?

2129
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:03,160
Wow. They get in a fight
with him when he's coked up.

2130
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:06,310
How about the fact that he
was partying and doing blown?

2131
02:04:06,311 --> 02:04:09,190
He's still beat the best guy
on the planet per sale, man.

2132
02:04:09,191 --> 02:04:12,040
You're hanging out with that kind of,
but you're doing cocaine off of it.

2133
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:15,610
You know, that's some hot chicks
out there having a good time.

2134
02:04:16,510 --> 02:04:18,610
You gotta be a wild motherfucker man show.

2135
02:04:18,611 --> 02:04:23,240
That's why I don't frequent those places
anymore. Yeah. Brazil or places. Sure.

2136
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:26,950
He never been in Brazil. No
beautiful place, man. But the, the,

2137
02:04:26,951 --> 02:04:30,490
the contrast between poverty
and wealth is very shocking.

2138
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:33,520
They're like right next to you, right?
Well, not only that, they're, you know,

2139
02:04:33,521 --> 02:04:34,450
all the Hollywood hills,

2140
02:04:34,451 --> 02:04:37,500
all the rich people live in the hills
and there were regular folks live there.

2141
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:38,130
It's

2142
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,230
the opposite in,
in Brazil.

2143
02:04:40,290 --> 02:04:45,270
All the poor people in the hills
with his amazing view of the ocean.

2144
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:48,690
And then all the Rashid had
lived down on the bottom. Yeah.

2145
02:04:48,691 --> 02:04:52,080
So like they would have problems.
They've cleaned up a lot of it,

2146
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:53,430
but they'd have problems in the,

2147
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:56,850
people would leave the favelas and rob
people and then go back to the five Ellis.

2148
02:04:57,260 --> 02:04:58,050
You know the favelas,

2149
02:04:58,050 --> 02:05:01,360
like there's some like extreme
poverty and they were really mad.

2150
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:05,660
They had the most like the worst homeless
population on the planet a few years

2151
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:07,980
ago. Yeah, it can get bad and some spots,

2152
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:12,180
but it's also like they're really
nice people. Like Brazil is fun, man.

2153
02:05:12,181 --> 02:05:15,960
I really love used to go there.
The food is fantastic.

2154
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:17,670
They have those two Haas Korea's,

2155
02:05:17,671 --> 02:05:21,990
you know where they have the Brazilian
barbecue? It's like they cut the,

2156
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:23,780
yeah, they have it here. You know,

2157
02:05:23,781 --> 02:05:27,380
you ever go on the phone with me and
Patrice late. Great. Patrice O'neil.

2158
02:05:27,410 --> 02:05:28,530
We used to go.
When you're doing short,

2159
02:05:28,531 --> 02:05:33,120
he's watching shorties and he
brought me to that place. I go, dude,

2160
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:36,270
and this is when he know he had like
diet. I'm like, what are you doing man?

2161
02:05:36,271 --> 02:05:39,090
The guy's coming on this.
Yeah. He didn't give a fuck.

2162
02:05:39,091 --> 02:05:43,290
He just ate is eight and fucked
up his body. But in Brazil,

2163
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:46,470
they got real mad because they spent
so much money on the fucking World Cup,

2164
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:49,650
millions and millions and millions of
dollars to make these fucking stadiums and

2165
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:53,160
bringing all these people in with all the
poverty. Right? I'm like, what the fuck?

2166
02:05:53,161 --> 02:05:56,060
Where are you guys getting this money? You
assholes. You could have been, you know,

2167
02:05:56,140 --> 02:06:00,600
putting these kids through school and
giving people food and it's a mess.

2168
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:04,970
It's a mess. But illegal and,
uh, Brazil office, this isn't it.

2169
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:12,120
Not banning competition in Brazil. He sang
it in UFC. It's not bad. Oh, it isn't.

2170
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:17,820
Okay. The metabolites are not banned.
That's what it is. The metabolite.

2171
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:22,590
It's not illegal. It's like if you have
a marijuana metabolites in your system,

2172
02:06:22,591 --> 02:06:26,220
like now it's legal. Like there's
a certain amount of metabolites.

2173
02:06:26,221 --> 02:06:30,240
You're allowed to have it. You, he,
they changed it by like a large number.

2174
02:06:30,460 --> 02:06:31,293
And it used to be,

2175
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:34,500
it was like you could have like a trace
amount of marijuana in your system and

2176
02:06:34,501 --> 02:06:38,730
they could, uh, take your money away
and find you and take your victory away.

2177
02:06:38,731 --> 02:06:42,760
Like that's happened before, like with
Nick Diaz that happened, but now, um,

2178
02:06:42,810 --> 02:06:45,480
now you,
you could have quite a bit more.

2179
02:06:45,570 --> 02:06:48,360
As long as you're not high when you're
fighting, that's what they want now.

2180
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:49,021
They think,

2181
02:06:49,021 --> 02:06:52,200
think you should be allowed to smoke
pot to relax after training and all that

2182
02:06:52,201 --> 02:06:56,580
shit. But marijuana stays in your system
because it's fat soluble way longer,

2183
02:06:56,581 --> 02:07:01,330
like seven weeks. Whereas, um, with coke
it's like, oh, a couple of fucking days.

2184
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:06,050
I can tell you my marijuana story when
I came home from a dance club one night

2185
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:09,000
right after I just, before I started
doing comedy, he was living in Malden,

2186
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:11,570
Granada highlands up on the hill
there. Those are nice about it. Yeah.

2187
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:14,990
I come from the palace
by pilots and Sagas. Yes.

2188
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:18,780
We lived like a half a mile from it.
Okay. I come home, my buddies all,

2189
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,340
when I come home,
shit faced,

2190
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:24,300
there's a thing get tomato sauce and it's
like one in the morning, I'm starving.

2191
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:28,110
I make spaghetti, I eat enough
for like five people. Okay.

2192
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:33,600
I wake up like an hour later and my
ears are ringing in the rooms going like

2193
02:07:33,601 --> 02:07:36,010
this.
I started puking violently.

2194
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:40,030
I hit my buddies, come in,
I'm in the bathroom, I hear
them going to the kitchen,

2195
02:07:40,031 --> 02:07:42,880
they go, he ate all the fuck
and they made Rasta Pasta

2196
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:49,210
and they ate this much of it.
They said they ate like, you know,

2197
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:51,490
a tiny amount.
They were fucked up all night.

2198
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:55,930
And this is a guy who I only get high
at that point a couple times in my life

2199
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:59,710
and that now my roommate's talking to
me. Right. He's right where you at?

2200
02:07:59,711 --> 02:08:02,620
He's like five feet away, but it sounds
like he's yelling from a mile away.

2201
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:05,160
I was tripping on the fucking,
they were going to take me.

2202
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:07,930
They didn't know if they should take
me to the hospital. I'm fucking puking.

2203
02:08:08,050 --> 02:08:12,700
I'm swearing at them and, and, and
honest to God, it was a week later,

2204
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:16,690
I remember watching the Superbowl
and still being fucked up. I don't,

2205
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,900
cause it's so much like you just said
when you went, when you ingest it orally,

2206
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:24,850
it's way stronger and, and, and it little
resent my system. I don't know how long.

2207
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:27,880
I mean, you know, you can look it up, but
I, and this is from somebody who didn't,

2208
02:08:27,881 --> 02:08:31,330
I didn't smoke a lot of weed.
That's crazy. A week later. Oh,

2209
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:33,110
at least a week weekly.
No,

2210
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:36,840
at least I'm probably being conservative
with that because it stays in,

2211
02:08:36,841 --> 02:08:40,480
if you saw how much I ate, you know,
if you saw how much tomato sauce,

2212
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:45,520
such a grease ball and,
and uh, and they were like,

2213
02:08:45,521 --> 02:08:49,030
they were fucked up all my was like
this much. And they were like, oh no,

2214
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:53,020
you're making up the fingers. Like a
hockey puck. Yeah. Forget I'm not on TV,

2215
02:08:53,210 --> 02:08:56,230
but yeah, about half the size of a hockey.
But it, and I was sitting there like,

2216
02:08:56,231 --> 02:09:00,700
you know, and my ears were ringing
and they would, like I said,

2217
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:03,580
my roommate's like that close to me and
it sounded like he was yelling down the

2218
02:09:03,581 --> 02:09:07,420
hallway. I was tripping on the
fucking THC or whatever it is.

2219
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:11,230
Yeah, it's a 11 hydroxy metabolite
is what happens when you,

2220
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:16,500
the THC passes through the liver and which
they think was most of the way people

2221
02:09:16,571 --> 02:09:17,404
used to eat.

2222
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:21,160
Well they used to take hash and eat
it back in the day and that's like

2223
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:24,830
responsible for like a lot of the
psychedelic writing and then the,

2224
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:27,430
the rig Veda and all the Hindu scriptures.

2225
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:32,170
A lot of that was written while they were
on eating marijuana. Eating catalyst.

2226
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:35,020
Yeah. It's like it's very
psychedelic when you eat a lot of it,

2227
02:09:35,021 --> 02:09:38,200
you trip your fucking balls off.
It's not like smoking pot.

2228
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:41,740
You could smoke a lot of pot. You just
get really high. But when you eat it,

2229
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:44,470
oh it does really crazy things.
I was a fucking match.

2230
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:46,690
I didn't feel right forever.
When you closed your eyes,

2231
02:09:46,691 --> 02:09:48,940
you see nutty shit like hallucinate.

2232
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:54,040
I don't remember that.
I do remember the voices though.

2233
02:09:54,930 --> 02:09:55,570
Well No.

2234
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:59,110
Somebody talking to me being that close
and it sounded like they were yelling

2235
02:09:59,111 --> 02:10:01,090
down the hallway.
It was freaking me out.

2236
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:03,580
I'm not a drunk guy in a
little blow like anybody else.

2237
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:05,840
Your whole system has been so fucked up.

2238
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:10,630
That's so much like I get scared here
when people talk about stuff like that.

2239
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:13,000
Like I start getting nervous.
My hands are sweaty right now.

2240
02:10:13,450 --> 02:10:16,150
That's what I'm saying. What's the stuff
you do? I want to hear more about this.

2241
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:19,370
Dimethyltryptamine the
thing about DMT is it, it,

2242
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:22,540
it leaves your body really quick.
Like 15 minutes later it's gone.

2243
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:28,340
But how long, how long are you on
that? Uh, will hi will you will your,

2244
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:32,240
it's your sober in 15 minutes. Rarely.
Yeah. I might try the cit tonight.

2245
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:34,140
It breaks your brain though. No, it does.

2246
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:39,470
It does. What? He doesn't ever done it
and his brain is broken. So don't know.

2247
02:10:40,050 --> 02:10:44,660
Joe Seems pretty fine.
Expanded his horizons and
trust me your, you'll be fine.

2248
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,010
I heard you talking about it.

2249
02:10:46,590 --> 02:10:51,260
One of those specials you would taking
questions and answers after and you would

2250
02:10:51,261 --> 02:10:53,630
just explain the shit.
I was in my car listening on the radio.

2251
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:58,370
I was coming home from a
Gig and I go, Holy Shit, I
almost want to try this stuff.

2252
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:01,280
Well, it's a good thing to
try and that it's over quick.

2253
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:07,440
I took Tony Hinchcliffe, we did it
allegedly in Austin, Texas die. No,

2254
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:12,170
no, he's alive. He's
doing well. But it's um,

2255
02:11:12,470 --> 02:11:15,110
it's like I can't explain
it and you can't explain it.

2256
02:11:15,111 --> 02:11:17,180
You just did great that
night when I was listening.

2257
02:11:17,210 --> 02:11:20,900
How it changes your perception of
everything. It definitely does that.

2258
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:23,210
It definitely changes your perception
of everything. How about your marriage?

2259
02:11:23,211 --> 02:11:25,040
Did it,
I don't think it had any effect on that.

2260
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:30,020
Does honestly is it shows you
that there's more that like,

2261
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:35,050
supposedly there's like
multiple dimensions that exist
simultaneously all around

2262
02:11:35,361 --> 02:11:39,020
us. We only exist in this dimension.
This is like what physicists believe.

2263
02:11:39,370 --> 02:11:39,660
You know,

2264
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:43,730
there's like 11 different dimensions and
it's probably that we just don't have

2265
02:11:43,731 --> 02:11:44,564
the sensory dep.

2266
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:48,230
We don't have the sensory perception
abilities to perceive these things.

2267
02:11:48,231 --> 02:11:50,600
Like if you took a,
an aunt and you know,

2268
02:11:50,601 --> 02:11:52,580
you fucking held a book
over the aunt's head,

2269
02:11:52,581 --> 02:11:54,680
do you think they know that
there's letters over there,

2270
02:11:55,190 --> 02:11:56,750
they don't understand what
the fuck you're doing.

2271
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,120
Like they don't need to
be able to perceive that.

2272
02:11:59,121 --> 02:12:01,960
We have developed and evolved with,
uh,

2273
02:12:02,690 --> 02:12:06,350
our abilities are perceiving
what's in front of us all the time,

2274
02:12:06,351 --> 02:12:09,200
whether it's hunting and
gathering or recognizing enemies.

2275
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:12,030
Like that's where all of our
senses come from. Our hearing,

2276
02:12:12,031 --> 02:12:16,550
our feeling or touch to have sex, make
more people to know when you're hungry,

2277
02:12:16,551 --> 02:12:17,361
all those different things.

2278
02:12:17,361 --> 02:12:21,710
But it's very likely that there's a lot
of shit around us all the time that we

2279
02:12:21,711 --> 02:12:23,060
just can't take in.

2280
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:28,540
And this neuro chemical that your brain
produces when you take it in large

2281
02:12:28,731 --> 02:12:29,564
doses,

2282
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:34,630
it allows you a very brief but incredibly
potent window into what's likely there

2283
02:12:35,811 --> 02:12:36,644
all the time.

2284
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:42,700
But what do you see? What do you
seeing visually is the change that,

2285
02:12:42,701 --> 02:12:46,320
to describe it to you? Oh yeah, you're,
the world dissolves, you know, you,

2286
02:12:46,690 --> 02:12:48,520
you live in a word.
Some of that

2287
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:53,870
can of jesters and bike lights that are
indescribable geometric patterns that

2288
02:12:56,661 --> 02:13:01,030
are just infinite fractal. They go on
forever and it's the most potent thing

2289
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:01,870
could ever explain.

2290
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:05,020
I would never show it to you and
it like an Alex Gray painting.

2291
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:07,840
This is like a little clarity. Yeah. Well,

2292
02:13:07,841 --> 02:13:12,610
this guy does all of his shit while he's
a paint doesn't mean doubt. Jon Jones,

2293
02:13:12,611 --> 02:13:17,470
a prom picture. It's snowball king is
when it says on his, uh Oh no it doesn't.

2294
02:13:17,471 --> 02:13:21,730
That's supposedly real. Well he lived
in New York, man had a snow ball battle.

2295
02:13:22,150 --> 02:13:25,780
That's true. Be Rude Brian. Seriously,

2296
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:29,890
this is the kind of shit that you say.
Literally she should see shit like that.

2297
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:34,530
I'll go a rug store. That's how fucked
gray. Oh my. He paints that when he's,

2298
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:35,680
when he's tripping on that shit.

2299
02:13:35,681 --> 02:13:40,080
I mean he's a what you would call a
visionary artist and he is a very well

2300
02:13:40,081 --> 02:13:44,760
versed in tryptamine experiences, but
he's the best at like capturing those uh,

2301
02:13:44,761 --> 02:13:48,360
those images. And you saw stuff
like that. Exactly like that.

2302
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:52,020
Like almost exactly like
you see shit like that.

2303
02:13:52,021 --> 02:13:56,670
But it's like moving and turning into
itself and unbelievable. Like, I mean,

2304
02:13:56,710 --> 02:13:57,690
but humbling.

2305
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:00,060
Like you get out of it and you'd just
have a different view of the world.

2306
02:14:00,061 --> 02:14:02,700
Like your view of the world
just completely alters forever.

2307
02:14:03,090 --> 02:14:07,290
You've done mushrooms before? I
write and I haven't either. No,

2308
02:14:07,291 --> 02:14:10,890
you don't throw up on mushrooms.
Some people get it wrong.

2309
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:16,720
Mixing it with garlic and tomato sauce.
A little fussy.

2310
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:19,650
Yeah, it's like a, ain't not, no,

2311
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:23,570
it's not shithead Bella right now yet.
Dope ass.

2312
02:14:24,090 --> 02:14:27,120
You've only done, you've done
the accidental eating of the pot.

2313
02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:32,010
A little bit of smoking and you know
everybody in the 80s I never did it, man.

2314
02:14:32,011 --> 02:14:35,640
I've avoided it. Avoided it. Really
never know what you're missing, Joe.

2315
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:38,550
I had a buddy. You feel good and you get
really angry for the next three days.

2316
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:43,230
Horrible. Not Interested. I
had a buddy who's a cousin,

2317
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:48,150
was a dealer and I watched his, his life
erode and a, this is when I was like,

2318
02:14:48,430 --> 02:14:52,140
I guess I was like 1516 I watched this
guy, he was a few years older than us.

2319
02:14:52,530 --> 02:14:56,130
He had graduated from high school and
just fell apart and it just got real

2320
02:14:56,131 --> 02:14:59,220
skinny as hide. Haydn, his fucking,
they had an attic apartment.

2321
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:03,420
They lived in his parent's attic or
something like that and they would just do

2322
02:15:03,421 --> 02:15:06,510
coke and watch TV. It was a
mess. She wasn't doing it right.

2323
02:15:06,730 --> 02:15:09,300
Well you have to be in a dance
club with a bunch of horse.

2324
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:13,380
I think he was doing it because he had
a lot of it because he was selling it,

2325
02:15:13,410 --> 02:15:13,741
you know,

2326
02:15:13,741 --> 02:15:18,510
so he in it all the time and so I got
to see this guy just fucking erode,

2327
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:22,670
you know? Yeah. You didn't miss nothing
that you feel good for like 15 minutes.

2328
02:15:22,671 --> 02:15:26,760
It's you fork. And then especially
with my type of personality,

2329
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:28,230
like the crash,
right?

2330
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:33,000
Oh I'm just depressed and not interested.
I never got the crash.

2331
02:15:33,001 --> 02:15:36,180
I never that I never got the bad part
of it cause that's cheery guy. No,

2332
02:15:36,181 --> 02:15:40,210
he's there all the time. He
lives in the crash. Exactly.

2333
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,080
Chicks love it so much.
That's the best part.

2334
02:15:43,081 --> 02:15:45,270
Like I used to just carry
it around and pull it out.

2335
02:15:45,271 --> 02:15:48,630
If I saw a hot girl and immediately
you're in into her house,

2336
02:15:48,670 --> 02:15:50,510
you know like yeah,

2337
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:54,690
they really did so crazy cause
they didn't get all sloppy.

2338
02:15:54,691 --> 02:15:59,460
Like when they get drunk and oh
remember our friends back in the day,

2339
02:15:59,461 --> 02:16:01,000
they would just like
put it on that account.

2340
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:04,650
I have a friend who used to get it
just because he knew girls wanted it.

2341
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:06,810
This is the best way to
get laid out like a trout.

2342
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:08,730
He would only do it if they wanted
to do it. You're like, all right,

2343
02:16:08,731 --> 02:16:11,640
I don't do it with your shit.
Fucking hated it, you know.

2344
02:16:11,641 --> 02:16:14,250
But he would do it because it was
the best way to get laid. He's like,

2345
02:16:14,251 --> 02:16:17,130
if you don't have coke, and I got in late
and I was like, really? That's so crazy.

2346
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:18,990
But when you got it got damn.

2347
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:22,560
I would watch girls run after him just
run because they knew he had coke cause

2348
02:16:22,561 --> 02:16:27,390
it was like that term coke whore.
There's no, there's no coke studs.

2349
02:16:28,370 --> 02:16:32,020
You know there's no guys so good pint
bang in fat chicks because they got a

2350
02:16:32,021 --> 02:16:36,130
barrel of coke, their house. It's so true.
I bet you feminist would say that too.

2351
02:16:36,131 --> 02:16:39,740
It's not fair. We are whores when we
do it. You guys are dealers. Right?

2352
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:40,870
But it is true,
right?

2353
02:16:40,871 --> 02:16:45,830
Like why does it is coke whore is a very
legitimate expression like or whatever

2354
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:50,410
coke, promiscuous gow call it.
Let's stop. Call them cohorts.

2355
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:56,100
Let's try, let's try to be kind here.
Coke, promiscuous female, you know,

2356
02:16:56,230 --> 02:17:00,310
but it's not like a coke man, you know.
Weird, right? That's true. That's true.

2357
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:03,850
Well kills dudes. Dick's right?
It doesn't kill your Dick. No,

2358
02:17:03,851 --> 02:17:07,630
but I watch killed your deck. No, he
always says it kills his deck. I know.

2359
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:09,830
I've never had a problem
with that ever Dick. Yeah.

2360
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:12,010
I got Trussell Dick Trussell deck.

2361
02:17:12,090 --> 02:17:16,580
So how's that photo?
The guy on stage? Yeah.

2362
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:19,410
You want to show that photo in the show?
Yeah. That, let's pull that photo up.

2363
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:22,960
Jamie. We were at the
Mirage this weekend, uh,

2364
02:17:23,300 --> 02:17:28,300
doing stand up and a Duncan was onstage
and Killen I guess he was loving it so

2365
02:17:29,081 --> 02:17:30,220
much is dick got hard.

2366
02:17:30,550 --> 02:17:34,780
So he's got the pants on tight
jeans and he's uh, he's uh,

2367
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:38,980
got a little woody and it's
so crazy because it's so big.

2368
02:17:39,630 --> 02:17:40,463
You noticed it.

2369
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:45,100
Did you notice it that night when he was
onstage while I was on the side and I

2370
02:17:45,101 --> 02:17:48,610
didn't see it. But look at that. That's

2371
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:54,390
does that, I don't know. It's very
calming. It's in the middle of that

2372
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:59,380
photo. Got It. Perfect. Like
he's almost pointing it out.

2373
02:17:59,450 --> 02:18:01,200
It's like he's like amazing.

2374
02:18:01,210 --> 02:18:05,240
Someone sucking his dick and I looked
like a magician making it rise. Right.

2375
02:18:06,060 --> 02:18:07,810
Ah,

2376
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:13,190
he has so much to Aaron Liba water.
Rodarius cauterize,

2377
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:18,460
cauterize don't exist anymore. Does
anybody by quarter isn't one apparently.

2378
02:18:18,970 --> 02:18:23,580
Can you even buy corduroys those are like
Tan genes. But yeah, there was another,

2379
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:27,370
there was a lot of fun times, man.
They were doing Ari and Dunkin kissed,

2380
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:30,880
which was one of the best things
I've ever seen. Pulled it off for me.

2381
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:34,240
My Instagram. Yeah. Yeah. They kissed, uh,

2382
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:36,400
when they knew that the
camera's going to be on them,

2383
02:18:36,640 --> 02:18:40,270
they in Dunkin kissed like when they knew
the camera was going to be there while

2384
02:18:40,271 --> 02:18:43,000
the fights are going on because they were
sitting in the front row right behind,

2385
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:46,640
I dunno.
And already had it in him.

2386
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:52,030
They had done it until Brian sends me a
text message with a photo of the two of

2387
02:18:52,031 --> 02:18:55,990
them kissing while I'm doing
commentary. My phone buzzes. I check it,

2388
02:18:56,500 --> 02:19:00,400
and I see the fucking picture and I
turned to look at them and I held up the

2389
02:19:00,401 --> 02:19:04,600
picture. And thank God it was in between
fights because it was like, you know,

2390
02:19:04,601 --> 02:19:07,330
a big promo thing, you know,
fucking Conor Mcgregor,

2391
02:19:07,331 --> 02:19:10,210
they're doing all this shit and I'm
fucking crying, laughing. I mean,

2392
02:19:10,211 --> 02:19:13,000
tears are rolling down my eyes.
Watch this. Watch this. Watch.

2393
02:19:14,510 --> 02:19:17,380
Look to the left.
There's Ari Fleischer is ducking.

2394
02:19:24,090 --> 02:19:28,110
There's more time. That is, it's

2395
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:28,953
so funny.

2396
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:38,840
Dot Com forward slash the Joe Rogan
experience. Oh yeah, that's that.

2397
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:41,810
W The guy next to you is I dust dusty.

2398
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:48,140
He's laughing his ass. Oh, frosty.
Frosty. He's our sound guy.

2399
02:19:48,610 --> 02:19:52,910
Looked disgusted. And one of them was
laughing and they also did a funny

2400
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:56,840
Illuminati. Oh yeah. It's not

2401
02:19:57,330 --> 02:20:00,770
Joe Rogan experience. It's instagram.com
forward slash Joe Rogan experience.

2402
02:20:00,810 --> 02:20:05,640
Just that. Yeah, but it's up
there. Fuck and Hilarious,
man. Those guys are so funny.

2403
02:20:06,570 --> 02:20:10,320
They're so silly. They have such, they
were on mushrooms too, by the way. Oh,

2404
02:20:11,390 --> 02:20:13,080
there are mushrooms all weekend.

2405
02:20:13,380 --> 02:20:18,120
They brought Ari brought allegedly
not true. I'm making this up.

2406
02:20:18,690 --> 02:20:22,900
If anybody's about about belt,
he brought to Shataki is about nine grams.

2407
02:20:22,901 --> 02:20:25,980
Saki and they were splitting them and
we were up til like five o'clock in the

2408
02:20:25,981 --> 02:20:27,400
morning. I couldn't do it. I can't.

2409
02:20:27,401 --> 02:20:29,820
I can't do mushrooms and then
watch people fight. Right.

2410
02:20:30,050 --> 02:20:33,690
I might pack up my shit and go home. I
might be like, I can't do this anymore.

2411
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:40,050
I called up the UFC. Listen, I'm
call Kenny Florian. It's over.

2412
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:44,550
I'm going to presale. Yeah, I'm going to
go to the jungle one with my inner soul.

2413
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:49,230
I was in Montreal with
Arie and this summer at the
festival and him and Metzger.

2414
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:53,240
I never saw so much. Wah. I
didn't, they weren't straight.
Perfectly. One minute. No.

2415
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:56,430
All Week. He enjoys that weed.
Oh, Mike makes him happy.

2416
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:58,230
Especially now that
he's doing really well.

2417
02:20:58,260 --> 02:21:01,050
Art is a happy motherfucker right now.
He said he's having so much fun.

2418
02:21:01,110 --> 02:21:02,670
His life is fantastic right now.

2419
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:07,320
He's doing so well because our evening
nut fucking guy, he worked hard.

2420
02:21:07,321 --> 02:21:09,300
He worked hard for a long time,

2421
02:21:09,301 --> 02:21:13,230
but his comedy is so God damn good right
now and it's good because of hard work.

2422
02:21:13,231 --> 02:21:14,370
It's beautiful to see man.

2423
02:21:14,371 --> 02:21:18,840
I love watching the guy just really
like pull it all together and fucking,

2424
02:21:19,230 --> 02:21:20,550
I mean just through sheer,

2425
02:21:20,551 --> 02:21:23,310
I've known [inaudible] since
he was an open miker you know,

2426
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:26,050
I became friends with them when he was
working at the door at the comedy store

2427
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:30,390
and through sheer will and hard work.
He's a great comic now.

2428
02:21:30,420 --> 02:21:34,200
I fucking love that. I'd love
Shit. I love seeing that happen.

2429
02:21:34,770 --> 02:21:39,030
He's a fun dude. I was watching him
at the, at the festival, him and yeah,

2430
02:21:39,031 --> 02:21:39,864
him and Metzker.

2431
02:21:39,970 --> 02:21:43,680
Hopefully they would tweet and before
the festival about joking about working

2432
02:21:43,830 --> 02:21:47,970
with me and they had making giant Depa
will probably smoke enough a DePaul.

2433
02:21:47,971 --> 02:21:51,240
I'm like, well I didn't even really
know anything about these two guys.

2434
02:21:51,241 --> 02:21:54,060
I know they're funny cats, but I
didn't know how much weight. I'm like,

2435
02:21:54,061 --> 02:21:54,451
what are all these?

2436
02:21:54,451 --> 02:21:57,690
We'd jokes tweeting about weed
and me being like a straight guy,

2437
02:21:57,691 --> 02:22:01,200
oh the fuck they think they are.
And then I get up to the festival man.

2438
02:22:01,650 --> 02:22:03,810
And they were just the whole time.

2439
02:22:03,930 --> 02:22:08,580
Well you gotta be careful to in Montreal
because it's not legal. It's not right.

2440
02:22:08,610 --> 02:22:13,380
No. And you get busted with weed and then
you know, they deport you. You're fucked.

2441
02:22:13,430 --> 02:22:16,860
Ceville because right now my festival,
but you can't come back either.

2442
02:22:16,861 --> 02:22:19,650
I mean they'll, you know, if
you get caught with drugs,

2443
02:22:19,890 --> 02:22:21,420
like in some parts of Canada,

2444
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:26,490
it's pretty much legal in Toronto and
it's pretty to legal in Vancouver.

2445
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:29,470
I was gonna say makeover.
Yeah. BC though. I mean,

2446
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:33,330
I was in a documentary called the union
that was based on the economy of a,

2447
02:22:33,331 --> 02:22:33,661
it would the,

2448
02:22:33,661 --> 02:22:37,410
the documenters based on how much
marijuana is involved in the economy of

2449
02:22:37,411 --> 02:22:40,320
British Columbia. And it's fucking
everything. It's, uh, if they,

2450
02:22:40,321 --> 02:22:45,090
if they pulled wheat out, if we didn't
exist, British Columbia would be fucked.

2451
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:48,060
Like so much of the money that flows,
oh,

2452
02:22:48,061 --> 02:22:52,050
is that a reddish come involved
with marijuana? Huge part of it.

2453
02:22:52,290 --> 02:22:54,750
And this is a documentary
by my friend Adam Score,

2454
02:22:54,751 --> 02:22:59,751
GE who just did a recent one called the
culture high that Brian was into and um,

2455
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:04,410
it's, he's just got these
great documentaries that
show like first of all the

2456
02:23:04,411 --> 02:23:08,370
hypocrisy involved and making weed
illegal. Why alcohol is legal,

2457
02:23:08,371 --> 02:23:09,630
whether you smoke weed or not,

2458
02:23:10,290 --> 02:23:13,830
it's fucking stupid and they
just highlight how stupid it is.

2459
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:17,250
But it just shows you like
how so British Columbia,

2460
02:23:17,400 --> 02:23:21,360
it's pretty pretty close to legal but
Montreal not so much. I'm not sure.

2461
02:23:21,361 --> 02:23:24,330
I was a little more tricky and it's scary
to a lot of people in a lot of people

2462
02:23:24,331 --> 02:23:26,340
do is keep like old joints in there.

2463
02:23:26,341 --> 02:23:28,320
Ash Trays in their cars
and things like that.

2464
02:23:28,321 --> 02:23:31,650
You could get pulled over and get a Dui
and then not be allowed to go back into

2465
02:23:31,651 --> 02:23:33,990
Canada because they want
to let you have DUIs.

2466
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:38,910
I saw my my car the other day and I had
to like a joint sitting my back seat and

2467
02:23:38,911 --> 02:23:39,301
I'm like,
dude,

2468
02:23:39,301 --> 02:23:43,620
I need to be not be the sloppy because
I would forget about the Dui aspect that

2469
02:23:43,621 --> 02:23:47,160
they can get you a Dui, but just being
stoned and driving, well not only that,

2470
02:23:47,161 --> 02:23:51,840
they're trying to crack down on that more
because look, the whole deal with Duis,

2471
02:23:51,841 --> 02:23:53,550
there's two things going on.
One,

2472
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:55,980
they're trying to keep people from
driving and smashing into people.

2473
02:23:55,981 --> 02:23:58,350
When people die and put two,
they got to make collars.

2474
02:23:58,530 --> 02:24:02,130
They're trying to make arrests.
They get, they have fucking like,

2475
02:24:02,190 --> 02:24:06,270
they have a schedule that they had to
have to adhere to their quotas. Quotas,

2476
02:24:06,390 --> 02:24:10,410
which should be illegal because like
what the fuck would they do if everybody

2477
02:24:10,411 --> 02:24:15,000
decided we won't break any laws for a
year? No one breaks a law for a year.

2478
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:17,910
What would they do with able to sway
off all the cops or would they treat him

2479
02:24:17,911 --> 02:24:21,210
like firemen where they just sit back and
wait for something to happen? You know,

2480
02:24:21,211 --> 02:24:24,210
nobody arrests. Nobody says, Hey,
it hasn't been a fire in six months.

2481
02:24:24,211 --> 02:24:26,520
How about we cut back on the
firemen? Fuck you. You know,

2482
02:24:26,521 --> 02:24:29,190
we know what it's like when there's a
fire. Keep the fucking firemen asshole.

2483
02:24:29,610 --> 02:24:33,690
But if there was no laws being broken
and the money wasn't coming in from the

2484
02:24:33,691 --> 02:24:38,010
cops to justify spending the money, you
know, on salaries and all that jazz,

2485
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:39,210
I wonder what they would do.

2486
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:43,110
We reach a point in our culture where
everyone's doing mushrooms all the time

2487
02:24:43,111 --> 02:24:45,690
and no one to the crimes,
no cops.

2488
02:24:46,730 --> 02:24:48,270
We hear what they're doing
now in New York City,

2489
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:51,390
cops are saying that they're not going
to arrest anybody unless it's absolutely

2490
02:24:51,391 --> 02:24:54,870
necessary, which is like, Whoa,
what the fuck does that mean?

2491
02:24:54,871 --> 02:24:56,790
You were arresting people
when it wasn't necessary.

2492
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:58,530
Isn't that a part of the God damn problem?

2493
02:24:58,531 --> 02:25:01,790
I mean there's sort of admitting
that everybody was right in that,

2494
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:05,850
that when they arrested that Eric Gardner
guy like this is fucking arrested some

2495
02:25:05,851 --> 02:25:07,590
guy for selling and
selling loose cigarettes.

2496
02:25:07,591 --> 02:25:10,970
Like isn't there someone selling crack
somewhere? Is there someone beaten babies?

2497
02:25:11,510 --> 02:25:13,050
Yeah.
But the city Yag meant there is,

2498
02:25:13,051 --> 02:25:16,890
that's how tax hungry fucking de Blasio
and the leftists are that they go after

2499
02:25:16,891 --> 02:25:21,300
they, they suggest that they,
that the cops enforce those laws.

2500
02:25:21,390 --> 02:25:24,040
So because it, because the taxes,
they were losing so much money

2501
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:27,580
with illegal cigarettes. Really? Yeah.
Cause they tax crazy in New York City.

2502
02:25:27,610 --> 02:25:32,560
How much money could lot eagle
cigarettes a lot. Yes. Yes.

2503
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:35,620
So stupid. But that's how obsessed
yeah. With fucking tag, you know,

2504
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:40,000
in this room to know that it's a left
wing thing that the left wing police or

2505
02:25:40,050 --> 02:25:45,050
the mayor is responsible for what we
would think of as a right wing act of

2506
02:25:46,061 --> 02:25:50,110
arresting someone. That's kind of fun.
Right? Yeah. Because like left wing,

2507
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:53,920
like left leftist ideology would be that,
you know,

2508
02:25:53,921 --> 02:25:56,770
these are racist cops that are doing it,
but maybe it's the fucking,

2509
02:25:56,950 --> 02:26:00,310
it really is a tax issue. Right.
It's forcing these guys to do,

2510
02:26:00,311 --> 02:26:03,220
a lot of people say that
and now the cops hate them.

2511
02:26:03,221 --> 02:26:06,670
They're alternative back on
him on the flight deck. I just,

2512
02:26:07,020 --> 02:26:09,700
I know nothing about him. Well,
he's just a fucking knew all.

2513
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:12,850
He went to fucking Cuba on his honeymoon.
That's all I need to know. He did.

2514
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:17,400
And he helped the east as he's a
fucking mark. Just cock sucker. He went,

2515
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:22,090
he went back in the day. Yeah. Really.

2516
02:26:22,570 --> 02:26:26,500
Holy Shit. He's, he's his
fire fucking left as they
come and what she's, whatever.

2517
02:26:26,501 --> 02:26:29,230
But, but hey, New York voted for him.
Whatever you get with your, you know,

2518
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:33,850
you get what? Yeah. Do York is very
left though. She's really left. Yeah.

2519
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:37,780
Well it's the two coasts. It's
here and you know, and, and I mean,

2520
02:26:37,781 --> 02:26:39,460
Chicago is liberal,
but not like that.

2521
02:26:39,490 --> 02:26:43,420
Not like putting New York is also
aggressive. It's a very strange place.

2522
02:26:43,421 --> 02:26:46,960
It's like there's aggressive, there's
progressive and aggressive. There's like,

2523
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:50,290
you got your extreme left like
Williamsburg and you know, all these,

2524
02:26:50,470 --> 02:26:54,820
these Brooklyn people that are like,
you know, everything is like super left.

2525
02:26:55,030 --> 02:26:56,350
But then you also have like some,

2526
02:26:56,730 --> 02:27:00,340
I saw more racism when I lived in New
York than any other places I lived. Ever.

2527
02:27:00,580 --> 02:27:03,530
The word Negra just came flying out
of people's mouths like it would,

2528
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:05,640
they had racial Tourette's.
Like I,

2529
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:09,180
when I lived in Boston I didn't
hear nearly as much racism.

2530
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:14,470
Where were you hearing that? New
York, a pool halls, uh, boxing gyms,

2531
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:17,980
martial arts places, all those stupid
places I was hanging out in it.

2532
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:19,810
Maybe it was the wrong hanging
out with the wrong people,

2533
02:27:19,960 --> 02:27:22,810
but I just heard a lot of racism.
I know a lot of road gigs.

2534
02:27:22,811 --> 02:27:24,610
I would hear racism
and a lot of road gigs.

2535
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:28,990
It just seemed more accepted in
New York then. It wasn't Boston.

2536
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:32,600
What do you think Boston's more
racist? No, I don't know. I just,

2537
02:27:32,630 --> 02:27:36,070
I don't hear the word anywhere.
Come out of white people ever.

2538
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:38,620
This kid to say it around you. That's
what it is. Except the bedroom.

2539
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:44,560
I bet him in the car.
I felt like when someone cuts you off,

2540
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:46,900
it comes out of your own mouth.

2541
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:52,360
But it seems like there's a weird thing
going on right now in New York where

2542
02:27:52,361 --> 02:27:56,800
they're trying to like fucking
fine, comfortable, happy
place, you know? Yeah. Well,

2543
02:27:57,380 --> 02:28:00,310
yeah, the mayor, whatever. Well, the
stock when it gets too political,

2544
02:28:00,311 --> 02:28:04,220
stop and search all that. Stop and Frisk,
Sinead, all that. An issue with he,

2545
02:28:04,420 --> 02:28:06,070
while he was campaigning to become mayor,

2546
02:28:06,071 --> 02:28:08,980
he painted the cops as bad guys and
then coming out and saying, well,

2547
02:28:08,981 --> 02:28:11,200
I have a son who was black
and I had to sit them down.

2548
02:28:11,201 --> 02:28:12,490
So you have to be careful around caught.

2549
02:28:12,491 --> 02:28:16,180
That's a fucking slap in the face to cops.
You're going to tell me a cop, a fuck.

2550
02:28:16,181 --> 02:28:19,750
Specially a white guy that goes into
the projects every night and rest his

2551
02:28:19,751 --> 02:28:23,960
fucking life to protect people from other
black people. He's racist. Mm. Come on.

2552
02:28:24,180 --> 02:28:27,290
Oh fucking, well not obviously this
bad cops. So you know, it's not good.

2553
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:31,830
Every group has shitty people in it and
this guy painted them, uh, you know,

2554
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:35,240
as the bad guys. And then you get Sharpton
involved. Who's a fucking scumbag?

2555
02:28:35,241 --> 02:28:37,140
I don't care what anybody says.
I mean,

2556
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:41,000
you sit him next to the police
commissioner on, on, you know,

2557
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:44,420
he's a meeting you have,
he's thin, he's a race panel.

2558
02:28:44,460 --> 02:28:47,460
So he makes his living and he said
was also a charlatan. I mean the,

2559
02:28:47,510 --> 02:28:49,730
the idea that that guy is expected at all.

2560
02:28:49,731 --> 02:28:53,790
You see him on CNN and the White House
80 times the last fucking it's for the

2561
02:28:53,790 --> 02:28:53,980
year.

2562
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:57,680
I mean that the black community had
Martin Luther King who's like universally

2563
02:28:57,681 --> 02:29:00,080
praised and a great leader
and now they have al Sharpton.

2564
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:01,520
Martin looked at Kingwood.

2565
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:04,970
Well you can't have Jesse Jackson the
more you notice that Jesse Jackson's a

2566
02:29:04,971 --> 02:29:06,380
fucking pariah.
You know why?

2567
02:29:06,381 --> 02:29:10,340
Cause he got busted but scamming all
these fucking companies out of 10.

2568
02:29:10,341 --> 02:29:13,340
That's what she does. Exactly. It was
under and all. That's what he does.

2569
02:29:13,341 --> 02:29:14,960
He shakes down,
come Pepsi,

2570
02:29:15,170 --> 02:29:17,390
it goes to Pepsi and so you don't have
enough pig black people. We're gonna,

2571
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:21,800
we're gonna pick it. And then they send
money to his action committees. Coalition.

2572
02:29:21,801 --> 02:29:25,820
Yeah. National Action Network and, but you
don't hear about Jesse Jackson anymore.

2573
02:29:25,821 --> 02:29:29,720
And then his son got busted. I remember
Jesse Jackson jail, right? Yeah.

2574
02:29:29,721 --> 02:29:34,580
He had mental problems. His
son like mentally ill. He
was on medication and stuff.

2575
02:29:35,210 --> 02:29:38,990
Yeah. It's just sad that the black
community doesn't have like a,

2576
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:42,530
a real powerful,
respected civil rights leader today.

2577
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:46,160
You know you're Al Sharpton will always
be defined by that. Tawana Brawley,

2578
02:29:47,250 --> 02:29:49,520
I mean you can just fucking quote pic.

2579
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:52,820
You could quote mine a million fucking
things that he said that a ridiculous,

2580
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:55,820
you know about how black
people can be racist.

2581
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:59,090
It's only white people that can be
racist like stupid shit like that.

2582
02:29:59,091 --> 02:30:01,430
Like come on man. Everybody
can be racing on. Exactly.

2583
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:04,770
Chinese people can be racist. Well
fucking Peruvians could be really what,

2584
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,633
what are you talking about?

2585
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:10,290
Like racism is not specific to like
one different nationality. It's,

2586
02:30:10,390 --> 02:30:15,200
it's the whole thing about being a cop
in my opinion is that being a cop is

2587
02:30:15,201 --> 02:30:17,060
almost a job that no one can do.

2588
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:22,480
It's to have that kind of power and a gun
and then to see violence and crime and

2589
02:30:22,731 --> 02:30:25,400
people lying to you
every day at their worst.

2590
02:30:25,730 --> 02:30:30,500
You see people at their worst every day.
Yeah. And now and when you do all the,

2591
02:30:30,590 --> 02:30:35,590
all the statistics and how many times
cops interact it literally they do their

2592
02:30:36,411 --> 02:30:38,720
job right.
99.9% of the time.

2593
02:30:39,230 --> 02:30:42,330
I mean it of course is
bad ones here and there.

2594
02:30:42,970 --> 02:30:46,970
This whole 9% and they're interacting
with a thousand people a day. You know,

2595
02:30:47,390 --> 02:30:48,620
every 12 million a year,

2596
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:51,830
you're getting a lot of
fucking bad interactions and
that was the ones that make

2597
02:30:51,831 --> 02:30:53,570
the paper.
Absolutely.

2598
02:30:53,900 --> 02:30:57,380
It's just the job that's like almost
impossible for a person. It's thankless.

2599
02:30:57,620 --> 02:31:00,380
That's why they should be treated
with respect, in my opinion. Yeah,

2600
02:31:00,381 --> 02:31:04,430
and it's not only just tankless, it's
also like the fucking stress, the PTSD.

2601
02:31:04,431 --> 02:31:07,820
Those guys must be under, they commit
suicide at an unbelievable rate.

2602
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:11,600
Unbelievable rate. Petty's Oh
cups, Buckeye and soldiers.

2603
02:31:11,630 --> 02:31:12,980
Very similar in that way.

2604
02:31:13,010 --> 02:31:17,330
They both have very high rates of suicide
and they both see ridiculous amounts

2605
02:31:17,331 --> 02:31:20,190
of shit. It's just almost like, seems like

2606
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:23,430
there should be a better way, but I
don't see about her way. I mean, I mean,

2607
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:27,330
I don't see how you could live in a
world that doesn't have cops. I mean,

2608
02:31:27,331 --> 02:31:31,850
there's people that think
that, oh, we should live in,
I'm an anarchist. Hilarious.

2609
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:34,890
To me, someone who's never
been in a way that's worked,

2610
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:40,530
they must've never met an asshole, you
know? You never know. It's just, well,

2611
02:31:40,531 --> 02:31:45,270
they're in denial. Then it, yeah. Well
it's also like a cute thing to say.

2612
02:31:45,420 --> 02:31:49,410
It puts you in like a very progressive
camp and of of of you know,

2613
02:31:49,411 --> 02:31:53,550
a very high level thinkers,
elite leftist thinkers. You know,

2614
02:31:53,551 --> 02:31:56,440
I'm an anarchist and I believe
that we should all be free. Yeah,

2615
02:31:56,700 --> 02:32:00,060
there should be no laws and let the
market decide what the fuck out of it.

2616
02:32:00,061 --> 02:32:01,380
That all sounds good in theory,

2617
02:32:01,381 --> 02:32:03,570
but then when the rubber hits
the road it all falls apart.

2618
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:06,210
That's how the Mongols came about.
If there was another,

2619
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:09,100
if you can point to another system of
government that works better than that,

2620
02:32:09,101 --> 02:32:10,860
so I'll be glad to fucking open my ears.

2621
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:13,750
How about a system of government that
works at all? It seems like we have,

2622
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:15,990
when people get together as
a large amount of people,

2623
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:18,570
you're just gonna always going to
have a certain amount of chaos,

2624
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:21,960
certain amount of crime,
certain amount of people doing shit.

2625
02:32:21,961 --> 02:32:25,800
They shouldn't be doing a certain amount
of fucking victimization and even look

2626
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:29,490
at the fucking shit that's going on right
now where we find out about bill Cosby,

2627
02:32:29,630 --> 02:32:33,330
a guy with money,
a guy with fame,

2628
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:37,860
a guy with everyone loves. He
still doing creepy, shitty things.

2629
02:32:37,861 --> 02:32:41,970
Like you have to have a
certain amount of law.

2630
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:46,390
You have to because even a guy like that
is doing fucked up shit. It's right.

2631
02:32:46,590 --> 02:32:50,460
Well it's about humanity with yeah.
And you know,

2632
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:53,400
that's why we all have to do
mushrooms and DMT. Nick. Well Dude,

2633
02:32:53,970 --> 02:32:57,330
I listening to you that night. I
was ready to go find some, but uh,

2634
02:32:57,360 --> 02:33:00,600
all the stores are plus,
it's very difficult to find in a store.

2635
02:33:00,870 --> 02:33:05,400
You gotta go to the back. It's like
buying Cuban cigars. He got to know a guy.

2636
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:09,570
Are we going to be able to
get Cuban cigars now? How's
that work? Yes. Supposedly.

2637
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:13,020
When is that going to only
plus to this thing. I got a,

2638
02:33:13,210 --> 02:33:17,640
almost got in trouble taking some back.
I at the last minute,

2639
02:33:18,030 --> 02:33:22,530
I didn't take some back from Montreal
and then the fucking guy at the airport

2640
02:33:22,531 --> 02:33:25,470
literally asked me, you got any
cigars in there? I go, what?

2641
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:28,020
Like I must have smelled like
a fucking cigar or something.

2642
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:31,170
I don't know what happened. I go, what?
And he goes, did you bring back any Q?

2643
02:33:31,171 --> 02:33:33,630
I'm just asking you because
they are illegal. I go, no,

2644
02:33:33,631 --> 02:33:35,340
I definitely did not bring back anything.

2645
02:33:35,341 --> 02:33:37,320
And they opened up my bag and they
looked at, there was nothing in there,

2646
02:33:37,321 --> 02:33:41,520
but I was like, oh shit. Like this is
real. Like they actually bused people.

2647
02:33:41,521 --> 02:33:45,570
You go to jail for having a fucking cigar.
It's a taste. Any different for real.

2648
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:48,510
I know one of those things,
right?

2649
02:33:48,511 --> 02:33:51,740
One of those fucking things like having
an alligator on your shirt, right?

2650
02:33:51,741 --> 02:33:56,730
You know like these are Cubans,
long law. I don't know man.

2651
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:59,880
Kevin James and I used to smoke a lot
of cigars together and he didn't like

2652
02:33:59,881 --> 02:34:03,480
Cubans. He's like, they're too fucking
strong. They'll knock you on your ass.

2653
02:34:03,481 --> 02:34:07,500
Like there's certain Cuban, like
a punch. Like that's one of them.

2654
02:34:07,501 --> 02:34:12,390
And there's a few, a Hoyle de Monterrey
double corona and he's big fucking fat.

2655
02:34:12,391 --> 02:34:16,830
Stogies they'll knock your Darryl
and how the dirt, they make you high.

2656
02:34:17,340 --> 02:34:17,980
You know,
I used to

2657
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:22,570
chew tobacco on college. Did you have
the, like the depth or the everything?

2658
02:34:22,810 --> 02:34:26,080
We had the depth that we had the Levi
Garrett leaves. That's the real shit.

2659
02:34:26,140 --> 02:34:29,530
That was the, those girls up there
chewing. No, I'm at the library one night.

2660
02:34:29,830 --> 02:34:34,510
I looked behind me. He's a
cute girl spitting into a cup,
but a, yeah, Levi Garrett.

2661
02:34:34,511 --> 02:34:39,040
The, the, the leaves and uh, that's
the real shit. Oh my God, it's bags.

2662
02:34:39,190 --> 02:34:43,270
Yes. I'd never done that
until I get up there. And uh,

2663
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:45,010
but then now I stopped doing that.

2664
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:47,740
And when I got out of college at my
buddy's house, he had some skull,

2665
02:34:48,100 --> 02:34:51,970
so I put a pinch of,
put a pinch in and I turned white.

2666
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:56,890
It felt like I was sea sick. I got all
sweaty and shit. It's like when you young,

2667
02:34:56,891 --> 02:34:59,680
you can handle that, all this
stuff. Well, I just was like,

2668
02:34:59,681 --> 02:35:01,840
what the fuck I'm going
to Puke when I was a kid.

2669
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:06,760
I was probably like 12 or 13 I was really
into Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn

2670
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:10,300
and I wanted to try chewing tobacco
cause Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn,

2671
02:35:10,301 --> 02:35:14,140
those moms. So I kind of
like a, it was like a square,

2672
02:35:14,141 --> 02:35:17,960
like a little Brownie of chewing tobacco
and you break a piece off and put in

2673
02:35:17,961 --> 02:35:21,490
your mouth fucking 12 oh I don't
know how I got it. First of all,

2674
02:35:21,491 --> 02:35:24,040
why someone's selling me
chewing tobacco because I was,

2675
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:27,430
I guess it was legal to get where I'm
like, I don't know how the fuck I got.

2676
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:29,740
I don't know how I got it.
Like now that I'm thinking about it,

2677
02:35:29,741 --> 02:35:32,650
but I remember chewing it and
fucking puking my brains out.

2678
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:37,130
The saliva build up in
my mouth. I was like, no.

2679
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:39,630
Yeah I did that toe. I can taste it. I,

2680
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:44,070
you know how like for a
long time I couldn't drink
Jack Daniels cause when sick

2681
02:35:44,130 --> 02:35:48,490
on it, yeah, we got
sick on it and know it.

2682
02:35:48,490 --> 02:35:50,710
I would smell it and I would
get sick just smelling it,

2683
02:35:50,980 --> 02:35:54,490
but that I could taste that chewing
tobacco right now if I think about it and

2684
02:35:54,491 --> 02:35:59,491
almost throw up cherry skull aspe
how about those little packets?

2685
02:35:59,771 --> 02:36:03,580
Like a tea bag? Yeah. That's pretty bad.

2686
02:36:03,670 --> 02:36:06,410
Well don't those give you like
massive mouth cancer though? Yeah.

2687
02:36:06,790 --> 02:36:08,410
They all do a video.

2688
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:13,420
That guy or that guy who got his John
removed like you would go to like do these

2689
02:36:13,781 --> 02:36:18,760
public service announcements that uh,
schools where kids would be snuff.

2690
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:24,530
He was like, no, fuck up some square jawed
captain America looking motherfucker.

2691
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:26,440
And then all of a sudden he's
got like no champion. Like,

2692
02:36:26,530 --> 02:36:28,660
Oh half his tongue was removed.

2693
02:36:29,610 --> 02:36:32,570
Half my time when I'm with curing tobacco,

2694
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:36,670
you're wiling to look like a baseball.
Probably not cool.

2695
02:36:37,990 --> 02:36:42,340
Everything's numb to him. Food tastes like
shit. Can't whistle, tastes like shit.

2696
02:36:42,340 --> 02:36:46,540
It falls out of his holding his side,
sloppy side of his face.

2697
02:36:46,570 --> 02:36:50,680
What's crazy is that they would advertise
not only candy cigarettes to kids,

2698
02:36:50,681 --> 02:36:55,090
but also big league chew, which is
like the chewing gum. That kind of,

2699
02:36:55,110 --> 02:36:58,330
it's the reason why I started
it. Yeah. He's like, Oh yeah,

2700
02:36:58,331 --> 02:37:00,970
like the baseball players. Remember big
league chew. This is the real stuff.

2701
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:06,010
It's gum, right? Shaving Gum
shavings. That's pretty evil.

2702
02:37:06,580 --> 02:37:09,640
A lot of places they made those a
little candy cigarettes illegal though,

2703
02:37:09,650 --> 02:37:12,670
didn't it? Yeah. I don't think he could
buy me where Kenya wearing their leggings.

2704
02:37:12,671 --> 02:37:16,010
Weird. It's weird. He's
like the cigarette in

2705
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:16,670
a fake gun.

2706
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:21,260
If the fucking candy people were
involved in the tobacco industry,

2707
02:37:21,261 --> 02:37:24,350
then it would make sense like you know,
and then you would go ahead.

2708
02:37:24,370 --> 02:37:27,440
I'll be where if there's
a direct correlation.

2709
02:37:28,430 --> 02:37:32,540
That was the most fucked up
police brutality thing was
that 12 year old kid that

2710
02:37:32,541 --> 02:37:36,470
got shot with having a fake gun
and Cleveland, you know that one.

2711
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:38,840
They shot him on in two
seconds of seeing him.

2712
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:40,350
They got out of the car
and just started on,

2713
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:43,520
don't drop the God didn't say anything.
Just started fucking crank, crank, crank,

2714
02:37:43,521 --> 02:37:46,670
crank. He didn't point it at him. I
don't know what the fuck happened.

2715
02:37:47,090 --> 02:37:50,530
I don't know. I wasn't there because
you have a split second. We hit silver.

2716
02:37:50,550 --> 02:37:53,780
We did a thing on the Chris rock show.
We did a sketch about that.

2717
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:58,010
I was playing a cop every,
I mean every, every sketch.

2718
02:37:58,010 --> 02:37:59,000
But that was one of the things,

2719
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:02,840
cause there was a shooting back then
and that was the sketch because somebody

2720
02:38:02,841 --> 02:38:05,870
recently get shot. The guy had a
banana, literally had a banana.

2721
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:09,050
I was reading this in the paper and I
freaked out cause we did a sketch and

2722
02:38:09,051 --> 02:38:12,500
Chris rock where we were cops and
they will holding up pictures. What,

2723
02:38:12,510 --> 02:38:15,290
what's this? And it was a banana.
That was the whole geno and we'd go,

2724
02:38:15,291 --> 02:38:18,550
it's a gun picture of a bike.
It's a gun. It was really,

2725
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:20,600
it was really funny.

2726
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:23,290
But then I read it because he gave
some guy literally had like a banana or

2727
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:26,570
wrapped in tin foil or something.
But you're a cop on the,

2728
02:38:26,650 --> 02:38:28,790
you have two seconds to make up your mind.
I mean what are you going to go?

2729
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:31,160
Oh you get shot. That's
true. That is true.

2730
02:38:31,220 --> 02:38:35,420
And they're not driving by spraying of
12 year old. But then I did, it was,

2731
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:39,470
he got released from another police
force for being like mental oval stable.

2732
02:38:39,700 --> 02:38:42,140
He's already trained and they hired
him and this other police force,

2733
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:44,840
there's a bunch of issues.
My friend Justin was a real gun nut,

2734
02:38:44,841 --> 02:38:46,020
told me the whole story behind it.

2735
02:38:46,021 --> 02:38:49,010
Like he's a his right wing as he get
and he told me the whole story behind.

2736
02:38:49,011 --> 02:38:52,790
He's like, that guy was fucked up. Like
that guy should not have been a copy. So,

2737
02:38:52,850 --> 02:38:54,060
but they make,
you know,

2738
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:56,540
there's a certain amount of money
involved in training one of those guys and

2739
02:38:56,541 --> 02:38:58,040
once that money's invested,
you'll,

2740
02:38:58,041 --> 02:39:01,580
they'll hire someone in another district
because of the fact they've already

2741
02:39:01,581 --> 02:39:02,830
been trained and you know,

2742
02:39:02,831 --> 02:39:05,550
you don't have to retrain anybody
and spend those resources. Yeah.

2743
02:39:05,551 --> 02:39:09,860
Too many second chances. When you were
working for, uh, for Chris Rock, I'm like,

2744
02:39:09,950 --> 02:39:13,790
did you work when you were developed?
Was he developing his specials?

2745
02:39:14,930 --> 02:39:17,390
We weren't. We would, we
weren't involved in that.

2746
02:39:17,750 --> 02:39:20,460
We were doing should in the
show he had his HBO show. Right.

2747
02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:23,760
We're coming up at such desired certain
guys though to work with a specialist.

2748
02:39:23,770 --> 02:39:28,520
Right. Like I know he um, Jenny helped to
them and well, well with like the Oscars,

2749
02:39:28,521 --> 02:39:31,550
he hired us, Richard, Jenny May and,

2750
02:39:31,551 --> 02:39:35,210
and punching up a couple of movies
and this is what it's watch came from.

2751
02:39:35,211 --> 02:39:39,920
He sent us up, ma'am. Actually
Tina Fey was there. Louie,

2752
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:44,120
we met at a hotel for a day and
just like punched up a script.

2753
02:39:44,150 --> 02:39:45,350
Tina Fey writes a lot.

2754
02:39:45,380 --> 02:39:49,340
Does she doesn't do something before
she was famous right before she got real

2755
02:39:49,341 --> 02:39:53,450
famous. Should do stand up. That's
a good question. I don't know.

2756
02:39:53,970 --> 02:39:57,110
I don't think so. I don't think so.
Probably second city and all that.

2757
02:39:57,111 --> 02:40:01,580
But she was funny and was writing at
SNL at the time. So, but uh, yeah,

2758
02:40:01,581 --> 02:40:03,140
we went to some hotel for the data,

2759
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:07,420
punch up a script and I remember
Tina Louie and whatever. But,

2760
02:40:07,421 --> 02:40:11,210
but like I bought about a month
later, we all get these Rolexes. Yeah.

2761
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:12,770
And it's inscribed in the back.

2762
02:40:12,771 --> 02:40:16,110
It says for you help motherfucker is what
it says on the back. Well that's cool.

2763
02:40:16,350 --> 02:40:19,170
That's, that was the most fun I ever
had my life. We're going to dead show.

2764
02:40:19,230 --> 02:40:22,560
Oh my God. He was so laid
back and just, he'd come in,

2765
02:40:22,561 --> 02:40:25,770
it would be an 80 degree day. He go, fuck
it. Let's go to the Yankees game. Oh,

2766
02:40:25,771 --> 02:40:29,610
that's cool. And then, then a big momma's
house came out of what I, one of those,

2767
02:40:30,340 --> 02:40:31,890
remember big moment or Martin Lawrence.

2768
02:40:31,891 --> 02:40:34,860
Martin Lawrence in the
second one came out and he,

2769
02:40:34,861 --> 02:40:38,100
I think Chris [inaudible] himself and
then he made us all go see it because it

2770
02:40:38,101 --> 02:40:38,934
was so bad.

2771
02:40:40,050 --> 02:40:44,290
He made us all go to the movie. We all
sat down, we all had tickets. And then

2772
02:40:44,530 --> 02:40:46,360
20 minutes in this scene,
somebody,

2773
02:40:46,510 --> 02:40:49,750
him sitting on the toilet making
shit jokes and then Chris goes, okay,

2774
02:40:49,751 --> 02:40:50,580
let's call it the tall one.

2775
02:40:50,580 --> 02:40:51,413
Good to see.

2776
02:40:54,450 --> 02:40:57,540
That's all they wanted you to see.
We all walked out.

2777
02:40:58,860 --> 02:41:00,790
That's all he wanted
to see. I mean, because

2778
02:41:00,790 --> 02:41:05,710
it was that bad. Yeah. We were all
laughing our ass off. But how bad it was.

2779
02:41:05,980 --> 02:41:08,170
Yeah. I mean it was shit,
but it was what it was.

2780
02:41:08,290 --> 02:41:11,690
What I expected from a big momma's
house or whatever the fuck you know.

2781
02:41:11,710 --> 02:41:15,490
I mean I love Martin Lawrence, the
comedy store. I met him out here.

2782
02:41:15,730 --> 02:41:20,730
Dave Chappelle had a really fucking good
point about what is it about black men

2783
02:41:21,101 --> 02:41:21,761
in Hollywood?

2784
02:41:21,761 --> 02:41:24,730
They reach a certain amount of fame and
they make you dress up like a woman.

2785
02:41:25,210 --> 02:41:28,660
Like that is true.
It's fucking Eddie Murphy did it.

2786
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:32,590
Jamie Foxx did it.
Marzi science conspiracy.

2787
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:36,310
I'm sure he was.
But I mean it is kind of funny.

2788
02:41:36,460 --> 02:41:38,440
I mean how many white guys
dress up like a woman?

2789
02:41:38,441 --> 02:41:42,820
You got Robin Williams who did
a Fuckin Hoffman, Mrs Doubtfire,

2790
02:41:43,180 --> 02:41:45,970
Dustin Hoffman, tootsie. Um,

2791
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:50,230
does it bosom buddies.
That's Tom Hanks.

2792
02:41:50,231 --> 02:41:53,170
But they weren't famous that they
became famous from doing that.

2793
02:41:53,170 --> 02:41:54,700
And that was sort of
a premise of the show.

2794
02:41:54,701 --> 02:41:57,910
They had a rent controlled place that
would only allow chicks or something like

2795
02:41:57,911 --> 02:42:02,530
that. Um, what was the one that
uh, you know who Patrick Swayze.

2796
02:42:02,531 --> 02:42:06,850
That's right. And again, that was
a fucking homeboy was in that too.

2797
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:10,750
I'm Wesley Snipes. Well, how
about this? He was in there too,

2798
02:42:10,870 --> 02:42:15,190
too long food day to Julie Newmar.
What was the uh, Dallas Player's club?

2799
02:42:15,210 --> 02:42:19,060
Bababa Jerry Lego. Jared Leto. Yeah,
but he was playing a transgender,

2800
02:42:19,380 --> 02:42:22,590
he was playing like a gay brand.
No, I'm just listening chair front.

2801
02:42:22,810 --> 02:42:26,050
He's not playing a woman. An actual
woman like Mama's house like that.

2802
02:42:26,051 --> 02:42:29,790
He was playing a woman like,
it wasn't like he was wearing a woman's,

2803
02:42:30,850 --> 02:42:32,810
not the fucking conspiracy theory.

2804
02:42:32,811 --> 02:42:35,830
The white Hollywood guys make it
black guys present. But Ralph Harris,

2805
02:42:35,950 --> 02:42:38,890
remember Ralph Harris? He had a TV
show where he dressed up like a woman.

2806
02:42:40,180 --> 02:42:44,170
No Brown. Ralph Harris had like a TV show.
I remember Ralph Harris. Funny, funny.

2807
02:42:45,230 --> 02:42:49,120
He had a TV show where he dressed
up like a woman like on the show.

2808
02:42:50,170 --> 02:42:53,830
Robin Hair? No, Ralph. Ralph Harris.
Robin Harris was the funny guy.

2809
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:58,360
I'm thinking of Robin. Robin Harris is
very far my, he was like great Robin.

2810
02:42:58,480 --> 02:43:01,070
Well he was fucking funny.
He was like the king of uh,

2811
02:43:01,090 --> 02:43:04,540
black la comedy for a long first time
I saw him. He caught it comes out,

2812
02:43:04,541 --> 02:43:06,290
I think it was like a def
comedy jam things up and heat,

2813
02:43:06,291 --> 02:43:11,291
but he had just a wife beater on with a
big gut hanging out and I was crying at

2814
02:43:11,591 --> 02:43:12,040
how funny

2815
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:16,780
the material was just but just
working class. I mean, oh my God.

2816
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:19,570
He didn't give a fuck. I don't know
if he ever really got really famous.

2817
02:43:19,690 --> 02:43:22,350
He was about to,
he was on the verge.

2818
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:25,870
He had this one joke that
fucking killed me and he goes,

2819
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:29,290
I don't ever mess with no pretty women.
Pretty women was too much work.

2820
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:34,360
I don't like me an ugly girl. I tell
other girl, bitch, I'm going to the moon.

2821
02:43:35,080 --> 02:43:39,580
Oh, you be careful up there. I don't
want nothing bad to happen to you.

2822
02:43:41,410 --> 02:43:45,310
He didn't make his eyes big when you'd
say it. Oh, you be careful up there.

2823
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:49,750
You have to say it, man. He was
funny. He was a funny dude. Bad.

2824
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:54,610
He was a funny dude. This is a three hour
show. Yeah, it's over. It's over. We did.

2825
02:43:55,570 --> 02:43:59,970
You always do. All the time. Once you
start talking, look, how easy was it?

2826
02:43:59,971 --> 02:44:02,410
You just did it to no, I know
that's hard to do. No, I know.

2827
02:44:02,890 --> 02:44:06,580
I mean it's nice and have a studio
on cameras. I'm, I'm, I'm hunt.

2828
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:10,060
I'm hunched over a card table in the
fucking red sox hat on my basement.

2829
02:44:10,380 --> 02:44:14,040
Where you all of a sudden, Holy Shit.
Did you see that you ran out of gas?

2830
02:44:14,450 --> 02:44:15,820
Three hours at the coffee.

2831
02:44:16,340 --> 02:44:19,210
I was like the fucking base porn tomorrow
I'll be up until for three days now.

2832
02:44:19,330 --> 02:44:21,810
Will you warm when you do your podcast,
do you do,

2833
02:44:21,850 --> 02:44:23,660
is it audio only or do
you have a camera on you?

2834
02:44:24,030 --> 02:44:26,490
I've only be done it like a little over
a year. How many episodes do you do it?

2835
02:44:26,491 --> 02:44:31,270
Once a week or once a week? I'm like 63
episodes in and I love it. I, I just,

2836
02:44:31,271 --> 02:44:33,250
cause I like radio. I
love radio. It's what it,

2837
02:44:33,510 --> 02:44:36,520
it's one of my favorite things is
almost as much as stand up. So,

2838
02:44:36,521 --> 02:44:38,790
but I don't have guests because I live
way up in the woods. Nobody's coming up.

2839
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:42,060
So you just do it. You stop talking for an
hour. I treat it like a radio, you know,

2840
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:46,360
I do new stuff. I treat it kind
of almost like a radio show.

2841
02:44:46,690 --> 02:44:49,910
Like bill bird does his stuff all
by himself too. Yeah. He rambles.

2842
02:44:50,050 --> 02:44:52,370
Rarely has a person on, yeah. Yeah.

2843
02:44:52,570 --> 02:44:57,460
He'll tell you read like a viewer email
or listener emails and stuff like that,

2844
02:44:57,461 --> 02:44:58,294
but I just,

2845
02:44:58,510 --> 02:45:02,410
I'll do stuff in the nose and despite
my personal life and just ramble.

2846
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:06,100
It's a good, it's like a good
exercise for radio. Oh yeah. To meet,

2847
02:45:06,101 --> 02:45:07,180
keep it moving forward.

2848
02:45:07,181 --> 02:45:09,940
Try to keep them at the Tei and I like
to play with sound effects and shit.

2849
02:45:09,940 --> 02:45:13,620
I'm just like a kid. Like a
iPad or something. Yeah. Yeah.

2850
02:45:13,630 --> 02:45:17,350
I have run it through my iPad. Two bits
of glass. Try that for like one episode.

2851
02:45:17,351 --> 02:45:21,670
I was like, well you don't have
