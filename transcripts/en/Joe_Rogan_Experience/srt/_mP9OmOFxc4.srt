1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,920
Three,
two,

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,230
one.
Boom.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,070
Hello,
Jack.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,750
What's up?
Nice to meet you,

5
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:11,920
man.
Nice to meet you finally.

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,600
Yeah.
Keep this soccer like a fist from your

7
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:14,020
face.
Oh,

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,520
that's good.
First of all,

9
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:19,600
Dude,
you started a company when you started

10
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:20,830
twitter.
When you guys first started.

11
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:23,380
Did you have any idea?
There's no way you could've added any

12
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:25,170
idea what it would be now?
No,

13
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,380
but one of the things I always try to
emphasize with people when the people

14
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:29,800
are like,
oh,

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,870
twitter's crazy.
Like how could it not be crazy?

16
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,450
There's never been anything like it
before.

17
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,480
Like imagine trying to predict
the kind of,

18
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,120
the president of United States uses
twitter to threaten other countries.

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,380
Yeah,
I mean fuck.

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,490
Saw that coming.
Nobody saw that coming.

21
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,080
You think it was going to be when you
first did it?

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,630
Well,
you know,

23
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,820
we were building this thing for
ourselves and that's how that,

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,660
that's how everything starts.
We wanted to use it.

25
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:01,200
We wanted to,
we wanted to,

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,880
you know,
stay connected with each other.

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,330
We group text like a group text.
We loved our phones.

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,820
We loved,
um,

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,420
technology.
We actually started this as a hack week

30
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:14,640
project out of a failed company called
Odeo.

31
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,270
Just podcasting.
I remember that super early on.

32
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,110
We were,
uh,

33
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,280
were really creative folks,
but we weren't that passionate about

34
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:28,281
where podcasting was going in our
particular domain.

35
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,350
We just got a lot of competition early
on Itunes,

36
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:35,130
just released their podcast directory.
But we knew we wanted to work together.

37
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:39,390
We knew
we love this idea of one button

38
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,820
publishing.
We love this idea of collaboration.

39
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:46,821
We love this idea of a being anywhere
and being able to share what was

40
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:49,710
happening.

41
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,150
That was,
that was the idea.

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
I mean that,
that was it.

43
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,260
And that's what we wanted it to be.
And I think the most beautiful and also

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,550
sometimes uncomfortable aspect of
twitter is it,

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,460
um,
we really learned what it wanted to be

46
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,090
and the people helped create it.
Like everything that we hold sacred now,

47
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,460
the at symbol,
the Hashtag,

48
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:18,180
the retweet,
those were not invented by me or the

49
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,280
company.
Those were things that we discovered,

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,590
things that we discovered people using
and we just observed it and we,

51
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,970
we noticed what they were trying to do.
They're trying to talk with one another.

52
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,880
They were trying to,
um,

53
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,100
collect tweets around topics with a
Hashtag.

54
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,590
Has anybody figured out when the first
use of Hashtag something was created?

55
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,551
Yeah,
it was,

56
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:43,670
um,
it was actually our lead designer,

57
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,880
uh,
Robert Anderson who leads our design of

58
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:50,420
the cash app.
I'm hired him for square uh,

59
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,340
later on,
but uh,

60
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,740
he was the first one.
He was actually communicating with his

61
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,370
brother and uh,
he put at buzz,

62
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,430
his brother's is buzz and it just kinda
spread.

63
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,640
It wasn't in mass but people were doing
it,

64
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:10,420
but what was most interesting is not
what they're doing,

65
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:13,720
but what they wanted to do with it.
They wanted to address each other and

66
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,210
that's,
that changed the company completely.

67
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:20,710
That changes the service because I went
from just broadcasting what's happening

68
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,250
to conversation and to being,
being able to address anyone publicly

69
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,130
out in the open,
which came with it a lot of power and

70
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:31,900
also a lot of issues as well.

71
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,001
Yeah.
The,

72
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:37,480
the use of Hashtags,
like a little looking up Hashtag,

73
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,130
you know,
fry fest or Hashtag,

74
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,830
you know,
anytime there's something weird that's

75
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:45,640
in the news that's a,
that's such a unique way to find things,

76
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,040
but to go on twitter and to,
to utilize that.

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,180
It's uh,
it's,

78
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,440
it's interesting that you're,
that this guy just did it just to

79
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,910
contact his brother.

80
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,340
Well that was,
that was the symbol of the Hashtag was

81
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:59,310
this Guy Christmas ina and he was trying
to,

82
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,560
he was trying to tag,
um,

83
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,930
Houston trying to tag around topics that
he was tweeting about.

84
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,090
And again,
that spread,

85
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,940
all we did was made it easier.
We made it more accessible.

86
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:12,550
We enabled everyone to do it.
Uh,

87
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,730
without symbol.
We made a page that collected all

88
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:19,900
mentions of your name with the Hashtag.
We allowed people to search a

89
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,880
immediately so you can tap on the
keyword.

90
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,840
And you would see everyone talking about
that or tweeting about that specific

91
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:28,390
Hashtag.
So these things were just emergent

92
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:32,500
behaviors that we didn't predict and
they became the lifeblood of the

93
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,334
service.

94
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,630
What's fascinating to me about something
like twitter or even something like

95
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:40,830
youtube is that there's not a lot of
other ones like it.

96
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,610
There's just this one thing,
like how does that happen where this one

97
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:49,140
thing sort of gets adopted by everybody
and takes over and then just becomes

98
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:53,130
this overwhelmingly massive platform.
I mean,

99
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:55,620
there's really,
there's Vimeo and there's a few other

100
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,580
video services,
but nothing on the scale of youtube.

101
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,920
And that's the same thing with twitter.
There's nothing on the scale of

102
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:03,870
distributing information in a quick,
short,

103
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,850
280 character form like that.

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,073
We,
um,

105
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,690
I,
I don't think we could plan for it.

106
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,150
I don't think we could necessarily
billed for that.

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,590
I,
uh,

108
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,240
someone said recently to,
uh,

109
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,110
we just,
you know,

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,190
gathered a bunch of our leadership last
week in palm springs for an offsite.

111
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:24,390
And someone said recently the twitter
was discovered.

112
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,410
And I think what's behind all that is
that it,

113
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,400
it,
it hits something foundational,

114
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,460
it hit something essential.
And my co founder Biz likes to say that

115
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:41,910
twitter can never be uninvented.
It's here.

116
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:46,350
It changed everything though.
The use of it has been revolutionary and

117
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,600
it's just this simple idea of,
you know,

118
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:53,601
if you could text with the entire world,
if you could actually reach anyone in

119
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:57,830
the world or anyone could see what
you're thinking,

120
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,020
which I think is also the beautiful
thing about,

121
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,870
about taxed and the,
and the medium.

122
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,920
You can actually get it,
someone's raw thoughts and anyone in the

123
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:11,540
world can see that instantaneously.
It becomes a subconscious.

124
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,770
It becomes this global consciousness.
And it,

125
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:19,010
uh,
it gets to some really deep places in

126
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:19,844
society.
And,

127
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,920
and some of those places are pretty
uncommon.

128
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,500
Well,
it also gets to some really deep places

129
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,000
psychologically.
Um,

130
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,050
there's,
there's some,

131
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,730
there's a weirdness to it,
right?

132
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,960
There's a weirdness to sending text,
particularly at anonymously,

133
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,971
you know,
um,

134
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:37,970
and there's so many accounts that are
just an egg,

135
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,580
you know,
so many accounts where they're clearly

136
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:41,810
designed,
if you like.

137
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:44,600
Sometimes someone will tweet something
mean to me and I'm like,

138
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,070
hmm,
I wonder what this person's up to.

139
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,000
So I go to their site and it's just them
tweeting mean shit at people all day

140
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,310
long.
Like it's probably some angry person at

141
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,350
work and then like,
I'm just going to find people and fuck

142
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:58,100
with them all day.
When did you realize,

143
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,170
or when did you realize,
I'm sure you're aware of it,

144
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:04,220
and when did you realize that this was
almost out of your control in terms of

145
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,240
the scale of it?

146
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,470
Uh,
there were,

147
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:08,304
there,
there wasn't,

148
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,780
there wasn't one moment,
there wasn't one moment that it just

149
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:16,490
felt completely resonant.
It's just,

150
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,880
it's,
it's unfolded into the next thing and

151
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:23,940
the next use case.
And it just keeps surprising us with how

152
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:25,830
people are using it.
We,

153
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,490
you know,
it,

154
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,560
it definitely.
Um,

155
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,100
recently I think we've identified some
of the areas of the service that we need

156
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:40,641
to pay a lot more attention to.
Twitter is unique in that it has two

157
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,640
main spaces,
one which is your timeline and those are

158
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:48,590
the people that you follow and uh,
you know,

159
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,890
when you follow someone,
they've earned that audience and then it

160
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:57,891
has this other world where anyone can
insert themselves into the conversation

161
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,850
they can actually mention you and you'll
see that without asking for it,

162
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,120
you can insert yourself into hashtags,
into a search.

163
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,820
Um,
and these are areas that people have

164
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:16,821
taken advantage of and these are the
areas that people have gained our

165
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:20,800
systems to in some cases artificially
amplify,

166
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:25,801
but also just to spread a lot of things
that weren't possible with the velocity

167
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:27,630
of that they're not possible before.

168
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Now when this is all happening,
what's the conversation like at twitter

169
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:35,900
when you recognizing that this is
happening,

170
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,580
that people are kind of gaming the
system?

171
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,410
Like what it,
how do you guys,

172
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,140
how do you mitigate it?
What's the discussion?

173
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,910
Well,
early on it was,

174
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:46,850
um,
it was pretty surface level.

175
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,060
Like,
how do we change some of the APP

176
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:54,200
dynamics,
but more recently we're trying to go a

177
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,630
lot deeper and asking ourselves the
question when people open twitter,

178
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:00,960
what are we incentivizing,
what are we telling them to do when they

179
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:04,100
open up this app?
We may not explicitly be doing it,

180
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,170
but there's something that we're saying
without,

181
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,950
um,
being as clear about it.

182
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,820
So what does the light button
incentivize?

183
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,770
What does the retweet,
incentivize?

184
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:21,771
What does the number of followers and
making that number big and bold

185
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,180
incentivize?
So

186
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,060
I'm not sure what we should.
I'm not sure if we should incentivize

187
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,210
anything,
but we need to understand what that is.

188
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:34,200
And I think,
you know,

189
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:39,201
right now we,
we do incentivize a lot of echo chambers

190
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,390
because we don't make it easy for people
to follow interests and topics.

191
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,090
It's only accounts we incentivize,
um,

192
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,770
a lot of outrage and how hot takes,
um,

193
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,020
because of the,
some of the dynamics in the service.

194
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:58,230
Not allowing a lot of nuance in
conversation earlier on,

195
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,770
um,
uh,

196
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,510
pseudonyms,
uh,

197
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,520
this,
uh,

198
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,660
this,
uh,

199
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,660
ability to not use your real name
incentivizes some positive things like

200
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:12,480
allows for whistleblowers and
journalists who,

201
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,780
uh,
might fear for their career or even

202
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,060
worse their life and under certain
regimes,

203
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,240
but also allows for people like the
example you mentioned of just random

204
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,710
fire and a spread of abuse and
harassment throughout.

205
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,070
So those are the things that we're
looking at and how do we,

206
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,310
how do we enable more of the
conversation to evolve?

207
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,020
How do we increase the credibility,
reputation of accounts?

208
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,640
Um,
how do we identify a credible voices

209
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:48,930
within a particular domain?
I'm not just through this very coarse

210
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,690
grain,
blue verified badge,

211
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:55,470
but if you're an expert in a particular
topic,

212
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:58,470
how do we recognize that in real time
and show that so that we can provide

213
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:02,460
more context to who you're talking to
and if you want to engage in a deeper

214
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,150
conversation or just ignore mute or
block them.

215
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,710
But what is the conversation like while
you were at work?

216
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,140
Like when you realized that all this
stuff is happening.

217
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,900
Um,
and you realizing that now,

218
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,030
particularly because the president uses
it so often in such a,

219
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,930
I mean,
it's his preferred platform for

220
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:24,710
communicating with the people.
I mean even more so than addresses.

221
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:26,180
It's really,
it's very strange.

222
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,270
What's the conversation like in the
office when you're trying to figure out,

223
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,160
hey,
what's our responsibility here?

224
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:33,920
Like how are we supposed to handle this
or how do we.

225
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,071
I mean,
you're,

226
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:39,200
you're,
in some ways what twitter is doing is

227
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,620
it's really kind of its flavoring,
the public narrative,

228
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,360
its flavoring,
the way we communicate with each other

229
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,850
in this,
in our culture worldwide.

230
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,620
Yeah,
I mean,

231
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,960
the conversation has definitely evolved.
I think in the past we just got super

232
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:57,030
reactive.
Um,

233
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,330
we were reacting to all the negative
things that we're seeing in that led to

234
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,640
a lot of short term thinking.
Um,

235
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,730
more recently we've just looked much
deeper.

236
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:10,660
We don't react to the,
to the present day where we look for

237
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,170
some of the patterns and um,
you know,

238
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:14,731
we,
we have,

239
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:15,940
uh,
we have a company that,

240
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,960
uh,
is not just serving the people of this

241
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:21,460
particular country,
the United States.

242
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:23,890
This is global,
we have global leaders all around the

243
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:27,220
use all around the world using us in,
in different ways.

244
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:28,300
Some,
you know,

245
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,560
more,
um,

246
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,060
with higher velocity,
some,

247
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,940
uh,
recognize more of the power.

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,970
Um,
some put out statements,

249
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:41,770
some lead conversations,
but it's looking at all those dynamics

250
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:46,771
and not trying to hyperfocus on any one
particular one because if we do,

251
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,410
we're only building it for one portion
of the population are only one perceived

252
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,730
a present,
a crisis.

253
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,760
What I'm,
what I'm trying to get at was like,

254
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,450
okay,
look,

255
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,600
when things come up,
like say if you find out that there's

256
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,890
people from Isis,
the using twitter and they using twitter

257
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:09,800
and posting things like what is the
conversation like,

258
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,360
how do,
what do we do about this?

259
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:13,500
Do we let them leave this up?
We,

260
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,630
we recognize this as free speech.
Do we only take it down if they're

261
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,260
calling for murder or hate speech?
Like what,

262
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,370
how do you handle that?

263
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,690
Well,
it evolves.

264
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:29,460
I mean because like we first saw isis
when the world saw isis and we needed to

265
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:30,900
change our policy to deal with it.

266
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,790
What was the,
what was the initial reaction to it?

267
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,560
So once you realized that people from
Isis,

268
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:39,220
we're making twitter accounts and they
were trying to recruit people and doing

269
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,690
all these things,
what was the,

270
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,050
what was the thought process?
Oh,

271
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,130
it was a question like what are,
what are we going to do about this?

272
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,570
We haven't experienced this before.
We need to.

273
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,471
Nobody has.
I mean,

274
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,630
you're essentially pioneered.

275
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,693
No.
Yeah,

276
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,180
but there,
there are people who have experienced in

277
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:56,690
different forms in different mediums.
So we reach out to our government

278
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:57,501
partners,
for instance,

279
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:01,310
our law enforcement partners,
we reach out to our peer companies to

280
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:03,410
ask if they're seeing the same things
that we're seeing.

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,890
Um,
we have a bunch of civil societies that

282
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:08,620
we talked to,
uh,

283
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,070
to get their take on it as well.
And we try to balance that across,

284
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:13,910
um,
you know,

285
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,400
various spectrums,
whether it be a,

286
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,030
you know,
a more organizations that are more

287
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:25,031
focused on preventing online harassment
all the way to the Acu and the eff who

288
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:27,860
are protecting the first amendment
online.

289
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,620
So we,
we try to get as many perspectives as

290
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,800
possible.
Take that and then make some informed

291
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:35,630
decisions,
but also realize that we're probably

292
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:40,631
gonna make some mistakes along the way
and all we can do to correct some of

293
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:44,750
that is just be open about where we are
and that's probably where we failed the

294
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:49,751
most in the past is we just haven't been
open about our thinking process.

295
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,400
Um,
what led particular decisions,

296
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:57,401
how our terms of service evolve in terms
of service as an area in our industry is

297
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,550
just a,
it's a mess.

298
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,310
No one reads them,
you,

299
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,260
you know,
you sign up for these services and you

300
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:11,261
quickly hit accept and we expect people
to read these rules of the road,

301
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,450
but they haven't read them.
And have you ever read them?

302
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,810
I have read.
Have you read facebook's?

303
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,260
I haven't read facebook.
I'm not on facebook.

304
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,580
I'm not on facebook.
Facebook,

305
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,310
right.
Just kidding.

306
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,300
What about instagram?
Do you ever read theirs?

307
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,980
I was,
uh,

308
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,190
I was in the first 10 users of a,
of instagram.

309
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,270
Really?
Uh,

310
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,510
Kevin was a intern.
Kevin Systrom was an internet at Odeo

311
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,310
and um,
I was one of the first investors of

312
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:46,220
instagram and loved the service side.
Don't think I've ever read their terms

313
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:47,480
of service.
Yeah,

314
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,170
that's what I'm saying.

315
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,370
Even you.
Even me,

316
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,620
but I read ours and one of the things I
noticed

317
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,290
right away is,
you know,

318
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,140
you read are uh,
you read our terms of service and one of

319
00:15:57,141 --> 00:16:02,141
the first things that we put at the top
of the page was copyright and

320
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:07,960
intellectual property protections.
You go down,

321
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,390
you scroll down,
you see everything about violent threats

322
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:16,391
and abuse and harassment and a safety
and it's not that the company intended

323
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,810
for that to be the order,
it just,

324
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,990
we just added things going on.
But even a read of that put forth our

325
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:28,300
point of view like we're,
we're,

326
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:32,240
we're actually putting copyright
infringement above the safety,

327
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,960
the physical safety of someone.
So we need to relook at some of these

328
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,500
things and how they've evolved and how
they reacted.

329
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,990
But is it above just because it's listed
in second?

330
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,170
I mean is they're essentially all in the
same one sheet there on the one sheet

331
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,230
when you.
When you bring it up,

332
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,570
when you discuss it first.
Is that really critical?

333
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,310
They're all.
They're all part of the terms of

334
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:51,880
service.
Yeah,

335
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,990
but I think that ordering matters,
like what,

336
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,870
what do we consider to be most important
and we have to consider physical safety

337
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,970
to the to be the one thing that we
protect the most and so I to go threats,

338
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,830
physical threats,
doxing,

339
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:09,130
doxing,
anything that impinges on someone's

340
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,780
physical safety.

341
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,680
An area where I don't think a technology
and services like ours have a focused on

342
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:20,430
enough.
We haven't focused on the f off platform

343
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:22,350
ramifications of what happens online.

344
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,600
So what do you do?
Like like here's a good,

345
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:28,260
for instance,
this situation with this,

346
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:32,470
a young kid who had the Maggot hat on
and the native American gentleman who

347
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:36,370
was in front of him banging the drum and
then people are calling for this kid's

348
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:37,690
name.
They want his name.

349
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,550
They want us to address,
including Kathy Griffin.

350
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,920
Like how do you.
How do you handle something like that?

351
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,800
Well,
because that's essentially request for

352
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:45,634
doxing.

353
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,110
Yeah.
And that's,

354
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,510
that is a new vector that we haven't
seen in mass and this,

355
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,140
these are,
these are the cases that bring up

356
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:54,690
entirely new thing,
so we have to study it.

357
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:59,250
We have to see how we reacted,
what happened with a network.

358
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,940
Um,
but this goes back to the incentives,

359
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,970
like we are incentivizing this very
quick reaction and it's taking away from

360
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,300
some of them,
some more of the like considered work

361
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,270
that we need to do to really diagnose
what's happening in the moment.

362
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,300
And it was such an interesting case
study to see how that evolved over just

363
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,603
48 hours.

364
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,140
Yes.
And that's one of the most fascinating

365
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:30,820
new cycles or stories in the new cycle
and quantitative because it's nuanced.

366
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,620
There's,
there's many different levels to it.

367
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,290
Yeah.
And a lot of like really knee jerk

368
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,120
reactions.

369
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,760
Totally.
And,

370
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,580
but we helped that had to help it.
Well,

371
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:42,300
it,
it's just,

372
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,610
that's how some of the dynamics of the
service work,

373
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,230
but those are those things we can

374
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,560
to make sure the service or is it the
way people choose to use the service?

375
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,120
Like if you're a thoughtful person,
you wouldn't just like for instance,

376
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,350
the original image that was distributed,
uh,

377
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,060
came from an account that's now banned,
right?

378
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,020
And so it was,
it was discovered that that account was

379
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,970
a troll account.
What,

380
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,080
how does that happen and what was the
thought process behind that?

381
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,800
Because the image that they posted was a
legitimate image.

382
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,070
It really did happen.
It wasn't,

383
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,420
it was a part of an actual occurring
event.

384
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,140
So why did you ban the person or the
troll account that put it up?

385
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,850
I don't know about this particular case,
but it's likely that it was found.

386
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,860
There's,
there's a lot of what you see on the

387
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:33,590
surface,
the twitter and some of the actions that

388
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:37,430
we take on the surface.
But where we spend a lot of our

389
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,830
enforcement is actually what's happening
underneath.

390
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,920
So in many cases we have um,
trolls or people like the case that you

391
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:51,131
mentioned whose sole purpose is just to
harass or abuse or spread a particular

392
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:59,861
information and oftentimes sees accounts
might be connected or they start one

393
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,450
account that gets banned,
they start another account,

394
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:07,451
but we can actually see this through a
network Lens and we can actually see

395
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:11,120
some of those behaviors.
So that might have been one of the

396
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:13,070
reasons I'm not sure in,
in,

397
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,910
in that particular case,
but you know,

398
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:17,170
at the,
how do you know,

399
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,310
do you know because of Ip addresses,
do you know because of the,

400
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,130
a variety of things.
So it could be,

401
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:26,210
it could be trying to use the same phone
number or St Mil address Ip addresses,

402
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,010
um,
device ids,

403
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,340
all these things that we can use to,
to judge what's happening within the

404
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:34,250
context.
So we do have a lot of occurrences of

405
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,850
suspending or temporarily suspending
accounts because of activities across

406
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:41,490
accounts.
Um,

407
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,353
and,
and that,

408
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,200
that happens a ton.
But what I mean,

409
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,980
what I mean in,
in that we're helping this right now is

410
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,880
like some of the incentives,
like just just imagine seeing that

411
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:55,300
unfold and when you see someone with one
take,

412
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,250
it kind of emboldened something to
follow along and then this mob kind of

413
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:04,360
rules.
So there has to be a way for us to

414
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:07,420
incentivize a,
a lot more,

415
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,940
more considered and more nuanced
introspection of what's going on.

416
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,390
Yeah.
Give everybody mushrooms.

417
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,840
Probably the only way to know how are
you going to get people to be more

418
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:16,674
considerate.
I mean,

419
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,730
what your engineering social behavior,
right?

420
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,350
Yup.
Provided more context,

421
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,730
context,
context.

422
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:27,700
Like as an example,
let's say brexit for example.

423
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,930
Okay.
So,

424
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:32,830
um,
if I followed a bunch of accounts that

425
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,900
like,
like Boris Johnson,

426
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:38,410
who was constantly giving me information
about reasons to leave,

427
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,910
I would probably only see that
perspective.

428
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,320
Nigel Farrage.
Yeah.

429
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:45,400
And those.
And those,

430
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,380
a lot of folks just will not follow
accounts that have a completely

431
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:53,200
different perspective or a different
influence.

432
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,930
A number of people do.
Hopefully journalists do,

433
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,880
but most people won't do that work.
So this is the only tool we give people

434
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:03,760
follow an account if,
however,

435
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,190
during that time you followed the
Hashtag,

436
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,500
you follow the Hashtag vote leave 95
percent of the conversation and the

437
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:16,501
tweets you see are all reasons to leave,
but there's a small percentage that

438
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:20,080
shows a different perspective and that
shows a different,

439
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,360
um,
a different reasoning.

440
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,380
We don't make it easy for anyone to do
that and that is for anyone to follow

441
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,140
the bit of perspective,
follow the Hashtag follow topic,

442
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:33,460
follow,
follow an interest.

443
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,850
And because of that we help build an
echo chamber and something that doesn't

444
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:45,811
really challenge any perspective and not
to say that we should force that upon

445
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:48,070
people,
but we don't even make it easy for

446
00:22:48,071 --> 00:22:49,390
people to do.
In the first place though,

447
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,210
the way you do that today,
as you go to the explore tab,

448
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:55,000
you look,
you search for a Hashtag or you tap into

449
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,610
a Hashtag and you can see all the
conversation.

450
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,080
But that's,
that's work.

451
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,500
And most people just won't do the work.
They'll stay in their timeline,

452
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:05,800
they'll see what they need to see.
And I can certainly imagine,

453
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,450
you know why if I'm just following a
bunch of people who have the exact same

454
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,910
take on this,
it just continues to embolden in Bolton

455
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:17,911
bolden and they see nothing of a
different perspective on the exact same,

456
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,580
the exact same situation.

457
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,280
What's interesting to me is the
difference between twitter and

458
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,160
instagram.
Essentially.

459
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:31,390
It's not just the photographs.
What's weird that has happened was

460
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,520
there's shitty people on instagram as
well.

461
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,650
I mean there's.
There's a lot of arguments and things

462
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:39,460
along those lines,
but they don't overwhelm the,

463
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,630
the initial post.
Whereas with twitter on a different

464
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,650
surface.
Yeah,

465
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,700
it's.
Instagram is a is a post.

466
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:50,780
I mean it's a post.
It's not really eliciting conversation

467
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:53,510
and soliciting comments.
It's difficult to follow the

468
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:56,180
conversations.
I don't think there was a conversation.

469
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,890
It sometimes there is some,
some.

470
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,740
Sometimes people are going back and
forth about a particular subject that's

471
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,860
discussed in the initial post,
but it's not.

472
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,790
It's not very clear.
Whereas with with twitter,

473
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,150
it only conference,
it's only conversation,

474
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,010
but even if there's a photograph,
even if somebody posted a photograph on

475
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:16,340
twitter and has conversation under it,
the photograph seems to be like of

476
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:17,480
secondary importance.

477
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,840
Super Fluid and super messy too.
But yeah,

478
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:26,930
the thing is every on instagram or any
any blog,

479
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:30,240
you have this,
this post the statement and you have

480
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:32,880
comments underneath.
Whereas with twitter,

481
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:36,690
everything is on the same surface.
It's all one surface.

482
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,740
Yeah.
My friend Kurt Metzger likes that about

483
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:40,060
facebook.
He says,

484
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:45,061
because in twitter egos I post something
and then all these fucking morons post

485
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:47,850
something and he goes,
you know Kurt,

486
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:50,950
he's very animated.
He's like in their shit looks like just

487
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:52,450
like my shit.
It's all together.

488
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,620
I'll pile up.
He goes,

489
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:56,290
but if I post something on facebook,
he goes,

490
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:59,590
I have this whole thing like this is the
statement.

491
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,100
And then underneath it,
yeah,

492
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,210
you fucking say whatever you want,
but no one's no one's reading that.

493
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,470
They're reading the original initial
post and it's clear that there's a

494
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:11,420
differentiation between the initial post
and the secondary post.

495
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,051
Yeah,
I,

496
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,260
I,
you know,

497
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,260
there's room for both models,
but I,

498
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,440
this conversation,
most conversations,

499
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,490
it's not you making a statement and me
just reacting to that,

500
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,280
like the,
our conversation evolves based on what

501
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:28,590
we say.
We can interrupt one another,

502
00:25:28,591 --> 00:25:29,720
we can,
you know,

503
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,960
we can completely change the subject.
I can take control of the conversation

504
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,580
and the people who might find that
interesting follow it and the folks that

505
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:43,100
don't just stop listening,
whereas you can't do that in a post

506
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,640
comment model.

507
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,480
Yeah.
It's also text is so limited there.

508
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,411
It's,
I mean,

509
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:52,350
it's great for just getting out actual
facts,

510
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,700
but it's so thinking.

511
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,600
It's just so close to thinking like if
there's no composition,

512
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,600
right.
You know,

513
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:58,434
and,
and that's uh,

514
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,720
that to me is the most beautiful thing
about twitter,

515
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:04,170
but also something that can be
uncomfortable.

516
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,710
Like I,
I can compose my life on Instagram,

517
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,740
I can compose my thoughts within a
facebook post and it can look so

518
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,360
perfect.
But the best of twitter is just super

519
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:21,570
raw and it's right,
it's right to the thinking process.

520
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:24,510
And I just think that's so beautiful
because it gets to,

521
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,090
it gets to consciousness,
it gets to something deeper.

522
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,290
And I think that deeper.
How so?

523
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,920
How is it different than a post on
instagram or post on facebook?

524
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,210
The speed demands,
you know,

525
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,300
the character constraint,
the speed of just demand to a more

526
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,420
conscious present focused thinking
versus stepping back and composing a

527
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,021
letter.
Yeah.

528
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:51,780
And composing a letter and thinking
about all the outcomes.

529
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,200
But oftentimes people do compose it as a
letter and they break it up into

530
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:57,790
separate 280 character posts.
Yeah.

531
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,310
The blue was the thought process in
going from 1:40 to 80 because the one

532
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:04,980
thing that I liked about 1:40 is that
you can't be verbose.

533
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,910
Yeah.
You can't just,

534
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,590
just ramble and,
you know,

535
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:10,080
like,
it's great for comics because he forces

536
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:12,360
us to write jokes like with economy of
words.

537
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,200
Exactly.
We,

538
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,940
uh,
we found a lot of resonance with what

539
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,390
journalists because the headlines we've
found a lot of resonance with,

540
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,550
with comics because of the rhythm.
And we found a lot of resonance with hip

541
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:26,460
hop as well because of the bars.
And just the structure and the

542
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:28,410
constraint allowed that,
that flow.

543
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,290
Um,
the,

544
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,280
the thinking was we looked at um,
our,

545
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,970
you know,
languages around the world and,

546
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:41,190
and uh,
there's some languages like German,

547
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,570
140 characters.

548
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,450
You can't really say much,
can't really say much at all because

549
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,520
words are so long.
There are some languages,

550
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:50,670
like Japanese 140 characters is 140
words.

551
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,370
And what was interesting about Japan was
Japan is one of our largest,

552
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,670
our largest countries were bigger than
facebook.

553
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:04,671
There were a lot bigger than facebook
and America know what the fuck.

554
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,680
I don't even use facebook,
sorry.

555
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:08,760
Facebook.
I don't either.

556
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,330
I mean I use it in terms of if I post
something on instagram it goes to

557
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:15,050
facebook,
but when I go to facebook it's,

558
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,020
it just seems like a lot.
But this seems like twitter to a lot of

559
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:23,400
arguing.
But what twitter seems to be more fun,

560
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,580
if that makes any sense.
Even though it's,

561
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,920
there's a lot of chaos when something.
One of my favorite things is when

562
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:32,790
someone post something stupid and then
underneath it is a bunch of Jeff's say

563
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:33,720
gifs or jifs.

564
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,210
I say Gif.
Does anybody know him?

565
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,810
Gifts?
I say gifts.

566
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,720
That's the jury's out.
A bunch of gifts that are hilarious now.

567
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,940
Like was just mocking someone
relentlessly.

568
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,000
Like that is one of my favorite things
about twitter.

569
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,630
I when someone like Donald trump posts
something ridiculous and then I'll go

570
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:56,340
and I'll look at the responses like how
do you care if it's a public

571
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:58,370
conversation and you can see our own
racks,

572
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,840
but like it's all.
The interesting thing about twitter is

573
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,610
there's.
There's not one twitter.

574
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,620
It's like you have politics.
Twitter which can be super toxic.

575
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,360
You have sports,
twitter,

576
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,320
you have NBA,
twitter,

577
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:11,880
you have mma,
twitter,

578
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:12,990
you have a UFC,
twitter,

579
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,550
you have k-pop,
twitter,

580
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,840
you have a black twitter,
black twitter has jamie's you.

581
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,720
He loves black.
All these different twitters and you and

582
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:24,450
you have a.
You have a completely different

583
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:27,990
experience based on what twitter you
follow in order to participate in.

584
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,090
Some of them were are like super
engaging,

585
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:32,010
super funny.
Some of them are,

586
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:33,660
um,
you want to walk away from it?

587
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,610
Yeah.
I got to a certain point where I

588
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:38,040
couldn't read replies anymore.
I just,

589
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,040
it's just not as,
not that it's that toxic.

590
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,590
The vast majority of interactions I have
with people are super positive.

591
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,470
That may mean absolutely like more than
99 percent,

592
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,600
but it's,
um,

593
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,050
I didn't,
I don't have time and I don't have time

594
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:55,960
to be constantly responding to people
and it just didn't.

595
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,910
The sheer numbers.
I think when I got around 3 million ish

596
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,030
followers,
I'm like,

597
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,780
I can't do this anymore.
It's just,

598
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:04,900
it's just,
it's overwhelming.

599
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,680
Like I don't have the resources.
I'm a huge believer in serendipity.

600
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,490
So you,
you,

601
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,880
you look at your replies once and you
might see something that just strikes

602
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:15,130
you and that's enough.
You don't need to read through all of

603
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:15,350
them.

604
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,530
Yeah.
And sometimes you might miss something

605
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:18,670
groovy.
You might.

606
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,580
But I also believe that the most
important thing is to come back up.

607
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,700
What I used to do a lot without go
through my mentions and when people

608
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:29,110
would essentially use it as almost a
news aggregator.

609
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,710
I go through my mentions that people
would post cool stories and then I would

610
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:35,530
retweet those and so because people knew
that I would retweet them,

611
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:38,140
they would send me a lot of cool stuff.
So because of that,

612
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:41,500
because of reciprocating a got a lot of
really cool stuff sent my way,

613
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,720
you're pushing,
you're pushing more out and expand the

614
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:48,721
network and I reinforced it.
I just wanted to thank people for

615
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:52,810
posting cool stuff and they love the
fact they would get a retweet and so

616
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:57,010
they would send me like interesting
science stories are very bizarre nature

617
00:30:57,011 --> 00:30:59,860
stories and I just retweet them all the
time.

618
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,520
Go to.
But then after awhile I'm like mmm,

619
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,260
this is a lot of time.
So a lot of times.

620
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:09,250
So now essentially what I do is I just
post something and I just kinda like,

621
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,100
I just walk away.
But that,

622
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:15,040
I mean that speaks of what we want to
incentivize more.

623
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:19,420
We want more people contributing things
that back to the network.

624
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,310
Back to the back to the public
conversation,

625
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:24,610
and I,
I know it doesn't feel like this today

626
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:29,380
for most people,
but my ideal is someone walks away from

627
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:33,130
twitter learning something and they're
actually learning something entirely

628
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:35,260
new.
That might be a new perspective.

629
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,820
That happens a lot.
It probably happens more often than we

630
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,930
follow.
Exactly it.

631
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,890
It's all dependent on the,
on the twitter.

632
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:44,170
You follow her and like the,
you know,

633
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:46,060
the health.
Twitter is amazing.

634
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,043
Uh,
you know,

635
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,130
I learned some,
I like,

636
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:53,131
I followed a Rhonda Patrick and I'm sure
in the sauna and I'm Wim Hoff and ice

637
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:57,810
pass and uh,
uh,

638
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,030
Ben Greenfield and you just follow them
and you just get all this new

639
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:04,900
information about alternative views of
how to stay healthy,

640
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:05,740
how to live longer.

641
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,630
And I can't find that anywhere else in
one place like that.

642
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,290
It's not just them broadcasting when
they retweet something or when they

643
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:16,690
tweet something,
there's a whole conversation about it.

644
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:17,400
So,
you know,

645
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,670
some people will say,
this is,

646
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,240
this has not been my experience or this
is not,

647
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,440
this is not true for me.
Or actually have you seen this connected

648
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:29,490
thing and I,
I just go down this rabbit hole and I,

649
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,020
I learned so much,
but that's not the experience for

650
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:33,340
everyone.
No.

651
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,860
Well yeah.
It's not the experience for everyone and

652
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:38,290
it's not really.
I don't think it's what everyone wants

653
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,820
either.
Sometimes people just like to go on

654
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,010
there and

655
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,810
talk shit.
I mean if someone that's trapped in a

656
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:45,080
cubicle right now and they just want to
go on there and get in arguments about

657
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:48,500
gun control or you know,
whether or not Nancy Polosi is the devil

658
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,410
and this is,
this is what it,

659
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,940
it serves a purpose for them.
The thing that gets strange though is

660
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,790
who's to decide.
You know,

661
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,710
there's this,
there's this concept,

662
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,900
there's a discussion I should say where,
uh,

663
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:09,190
some people believe that things like
twitter or facebook or any forum where

664
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,920
you're having a public discussion should
be considered almost like a public

665
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:16,550
utility.
Like anyone has access to the electric

666
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,170
power.
Even if you're,

667
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,780
you know,
even if you're a racist,

668
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,560
you still can get electricity and some
people think that you should have that

669
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:28,490
same ability with something like twitter
or the same ability with something like

670
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:31,130
instagram.
Obviously this is,

671
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,640
we're in uncharted territory and you
are,

672
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,120
you are in uncharted territory.

673
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,830
Totally.
It just,

674
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,280
no one has been there before.
So who makes the distinctions when you

675
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:43,790
see someone that,
that it's saying something that you

676
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:48,791
might think is offensive to some folks
but not offensive to the person who's

677
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,020
saying it.
Maybe the person who's saying it feels

678
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:55,100
like they need to express themselves and
this is important to say and how do you

679
00:33:55,101 --> 00:34:00,101
decide whether or not this is a valid
discussion or if this is air quotes,

680
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,850
hate speech,
which is,

681
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,150
you know,
there's some things that are hate speech

682
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:08,720
and there's sometimes people use the
term hate speech and it's just a cheap

683
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:10,580
way to shut down a conversation.
Yeah,

684
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,100
we.
So the simple answer is we look at

685
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:14,660
conduct.
We don't,

686
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,910
we don't look at the speech itself.
We look at conduct.

687
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:20,540
We look at how the tool is being used.
And you're,

688
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,510
you're right in that like I think when
people see twitter,

689
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:26,990
they see and they expect it to be a
public square.

690
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,240
They can go into that public square,
they can say whatever they want,

691
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:35,290
they can get on a pedestal and people
might gather around them and listen to

692
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,970
what they have to say.
Some of them might find it offensive and

693
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:42,700
they leave.
The difference is there's,

694
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,460
there's also this concept of this
megaphone and the megaphone can be

695
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,250
highly targeted now with twitter as
well.

696
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,500
So it's not,
it's not the,

697
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,840
it's not the speech,
it's how it's amplified.

698
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,400
So what do you do is say,
let's say there's someone in the media,

699
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,160
uh,
let's say it's a prominent feminist and

700
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:04,600
then you have a bunch of people or let's
say just one person and their twitter

701
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:07,870
feed is overwhelmingly attacking this
prominent feminist.

702
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,750
Just constantly attacking her,
calling her a liar,

703
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:14,230
calling her this calling that when do
you decide this is harassment?

704
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:16,930
When decide this is hate speech when
like how do you,

705
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:19,750
I mean this is a look at the conduct is
a fictional account.

706
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,820
Write fictional person we're talking
about.

707
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:24,040
But in this,
for instance,

708
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,350
what,
what would dictate something that was

709
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,640
egregious enough for you to eliminate
them from your plan?

710
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,713
Well,
that's a.

711
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,000
that's a.
that's a heavy action.

712
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,910
So that's a last.
But we look at the conduct.

713
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,940
We look at oftentimes as you said,
like the probability of someone who is

714
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,250
harassing one person,
it's highly probable that they're also

715
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,940
passing 10 more people,
right?

716
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,800
So we can look at that behavior.
We can look at how many times this

717
00:35:55,801 --> 00:36:00,090
person is being blocked or muted or
reported,

718
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,810
and based on all those,
all that data,

719
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:06,210
we can actually take some action,
but we also have to.

720
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,580
We have to correlate it with the other
side of that because people go on and

721
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:16,170
they coordinate blocks as well and they
coordinate harassment and they and they

722
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:17,070
coordinate.
I'm sorry,

723
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:18,840
not harassment,
but reporting.

724
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,370
I'm reporting a particular account to
get it shut down into a to take the

725
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:27,690
voice off the service.
So these are the considerations we have

726
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:28,390
to make,
but it's.

727
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,820
It's.
It all starts with conduct and all.

728
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,260
Oftentimes we'll see coordinated
conduct,

729
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:38,310
whether it be that one person opening
multiple counts or coordinating with

730
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,010
multiple accounts that they don't own
to,

731
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,310
you know,
go after someone and there's a bunch of

732
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:46,470
vectors that people use,
retweet for that,

733
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,720
uh,
the quote tweet for that a lot as well.

734
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:49,610
Like,
you know,

735
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,560
they'll quote tweet a tweet that someone
finds and they'll say,

736
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,900
look at this idiot twitter to your thing
and then just this mob starts and goes

737
00:36:57,901 --> 00:36:59,940
and tries to,
uh,

738
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,140
effectively shut that person down.
Um,

739
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,250
so there's a bunch of tools we can use.
The permanent suspension is the last

740
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:10,680
resort.
One of the things that we can do is we

741
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:14,820
can down rank the replies.
So any of these,

742
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:18,090
any of these behaviors and conduct that
looks link linked,

743
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,740
we can actually,
uh,

744
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,050
push farther down in the supply chain.

745
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,890
So it's all still there.
But you might have to push a button to

746
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:27,440
actually see it.
You might have to say,

747
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,600
show more replies to actually see this
harassing account or what might look

748
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:38,570
like harassing language.
And there's this manually done or no,

749
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,010
this is,
this is all,

750
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,020
this is all automated.
It's automated.

751
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:42,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

752
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,370
But how would you the ranking in the
end,

753
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,750
looking at amplification and looking at
the network is automated,

754
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,640
right?
Like in terms of ranking,

755
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,330
is there a discussion as to whether or
not this person's reply should be down

756
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:54,350
ranked?
Like how do you,

757
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,410
how do you figure that out?
It's a machine learning and deep

758
00:37:57,411 --> 00:38:01,050
learning model and they say I and they
and they learn,

759
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,323
you know,
and we,

760
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,840
we look at,
we look at how these things are doing

761
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:08,120
and where they make mistakes and then we
improve it.

762
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,310
It's just constantly improving,
constantly learning.

763
00:38:10,311 --> 00:38:12,650
And does that feel like censorship to
you?

764
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,220
Like automated censorship doesn't mean
who,

765
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,630
who is to decide other than people
whether or not something is valid?

766
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,621
Well,
we're not,

767
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:23,390
we're not looking at the,
at the speech.

768
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:25,650
In this particular case,
we're looking at the conduct,

769
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,050
the conduct,
the conduct of someone in fast velocity

770
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:31,850
attacking someone else.
Right?

771
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,560
So those are the things that our
technology allows changes,

772
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:37,840
the velocity of changes,
uh,

773
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:43,090
how to broadcast a message that someone
didn't really ask for and didn't want to

774
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,250
hear.
We don't touch.

775
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,600
If I follow Joe Rogan,
you'll see every single tweet.

776
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,290
We don't touch it,
right?

777
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:56,350
But that's an audience that you earn.
But in your replies page we have a

778
00:38:56,351 --> 00:39:01,000
little bit more room because this is a,
this is a conversation that starts up

779
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,680
and some people just want to disrupt it.

780
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,970
And all we're saying is we're going to
look at moving the disruption down.

781
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,580
Not that it's hidden,
but it's still there.

782
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,100
But you know,
you just see a little bit farther down.

783
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,040
Like there was a,
what was the incidence with Ari?

784
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:18,610
I should text him right now,
get them to answer me in real time,

785
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,120
but are you should fear got kicked off
twitter because he said something to

786
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,770
bird like bird,
I'm going to fucking kill you.

787
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,400
Bert Kreischer being our good friend,
all of us are good friends and he's

788
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:28,260
like,
you fucking dummy.

789
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,370
I'm going to kill you.
Or something like that as a record

790
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:31,870
albums.
He said he was gonna steal and I'm

791
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,000
breaking and got jokingly got mad.
Right,

792
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:34,510
right,
right.

793
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,220
That's already though Bert.
Bert was.

794
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,590
I think it was all bullshit.
Right?

795
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:40,100
I don't think Bert really stole his.
Him.

796
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,360
Yeah.
He gave them back to them eventually.

797
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,213
Yeah.
Yeah.

798
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,750
He's like,
I'm going to fucking kill you.

799
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,780
So what happened there?
What probably happened there,

800
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:49,870
and I'm not sure of the particular case,
but will probably happen there,

801
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,220
is someone might have reported that
tweet one of our agents,

802
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,610
a human agents without context of their
friendship or that relationship,

803
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,760
uh,
saw it as a violent threat and took

804
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:04,594
action on it.
Right?

805
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,430
And those are the mistakes that we're
going to make.

806
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:10,000
That's why we need an appeals process.
And Burt needs to keep his fucking

807
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,650
greasy hands off.
Are his records.

808
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,160
Right?
That's probably not going to happen.

809
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,010
We need to,
we need to make sure we need to make

810
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:19,420
sure that we're reacting to the right
way.

811
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,351
Like,
look,

812
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,870
we're going to make mistakes where we're
trying to.

813
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,610
That.
The problem with the system right now is

814
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:30,210
most of the most of the work is actually
in the burden is actually on the victims

815
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:36,151
of abuse while they're getting harassed,
so a lot of our system doesn't

816
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,480
enforce or act and less,
uh,

817
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,310
these tweets are reported,
right?

818
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:47,310
So we don't take suspension actions or
removal of content actions in less that

819
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,870
reported the algorithms rank and order
the conversation,

820
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,690
but they don't take suspension actions,
they don't take,

821
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:59,500
they don't remove content.
They might suggest to human to look at

822
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,250
this who might look at our rules and
look at the content and,

823
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:06,670
and try to look at the context of the
conversation and then take action.

824
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,120
But we would like to move towards a lot
more automated enforcement.

825
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:16,210
But more importantly,
how do we,

826
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,630
how do we highlight,
how do we amplify more of the healthier

827
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:24,100
discussion conversation?
Again,

828
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,850
not removing it,
I,

829
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,630
I,
we're,

830
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,360
we're,
we're going to a world,

831
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,670
especially with technology like
blockchain,

832
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,200
that all content that exists,
that has ever created will exist

833
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:38,600
forever.
You won't be able to take it down.

834
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,810
You won't be able to censor it.
It won't be centralized at all.

835
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,560
Our role is around what we recommend
based on your interest and based on who

836
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:52,830
you follow and and,
and helping you to get into that onramp.

837
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,340
But if you look at the architect
neurology,

838
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,360
it's a given that anytime something is
created,

839
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:05,030
it's going to exist forever.
This is what blockchain helps enable

840
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,140
down the line and we need to make sure
that we're paying attention to that and

841
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:10,940
also realizing that,
you know,

842
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:16,340
our role is like how do we,
how do we get people the stuff that they

843
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:18,950
really want to see in the find valuable
that they'll learn from,

844
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:23,600
that they'll make them think that will
help them evolve the conversation as

845
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:24,240
well.

846
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,770
Now when you say amplify the messages
that you deem to be more positive,

847
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:31,800
right?
Like how do you decide that people

848
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:32,940
decided?
People decide.

849
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:36,180
People decide it based on like are they,
are they engaging in replies?

850
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:38,550
Are they,
are they read tweeting it?

851
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:39,930
Are they liking it?
Are they.

852
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,660
Sometimes it's really negative,
like sometimes the people that are

853
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44,880
engaging and they're engaging in because
they're attacking someone.

854
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,530
So d,
is that valuable or is it just

855
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:50,364
unfortunate?

856
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,580
It's valuable.
I mean every,

857
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:56,210
every signal is something that we can
learn from and we can act on,

858
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,630
but it,
it's going to constantly evolve.

859
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,740
I mean it's,
these,

860
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,960
these,
these models that we have to build will

861
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:07,550
constantly have to learn what the
network is doing and how people are

862
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,980
using it.
And um,

863
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:10,780
you know,
our,

864
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,780
our goal is healthy contribution back to
the public conversation,

865
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:18,740
that that is what we want.
We want to encourage people into more,

866
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,830
bigger informative,
global conversations that they'll learn

867
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:25,664
from.

868
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,770
Are you like constantly aware of how
much this is changing society and that

869
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,780
you are one of the four or five
different modalities that are radically

870
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:39,970
changing society,
whether it's facebook or instagram or

871
00:43:39,971 --> 00:43:44,971
any of these social media companies.
It's radically changing the way people

872
00:43:45,431 --> 00:43:46,900
communicate with each other.
Like there's a,

873
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:51,150
there's a,
a giant impact on the way human beings

874
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:56,320
talk and see each other and the way we
process ideas and the way we distributed

875
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:57,850
information.
It's unprecedented.

876
00:43:57,851 --> 00:43:59,230
There's never been anything like that
before.

877
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,890
And you setting up something that you
think is going to be a group chat.

878
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,300
Do you remember the early days when you
would say like at Jack is going to the

879
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:09,730
movies and you would say like that's how
we'd say it.

880
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,640
I would say at Joe Rogan is on his way
to dinner.

881
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,020
That's how people would do.
It's fucking.

882
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,850
It was weird that somewhere along the
line that morphed

883
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,920
and that's what the world wanted to do
with it.

884
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,780
That's where,
that's where they wanted to take that.

885
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,590
Yeah,
and I just think it's so reflective of,

886
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:31,620
of what the world is and in some cases
what the world wants to

887
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,680
be,
so it's a a pathway for thinking.

888
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,380
Just a pathway for people to get their
thoughts out,

889
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:43,010
but a really powerful one and
unprecedented method of distributing

890
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:47,730
information.
It's really nothing ever been like this

891
00:44:47,731 --> 00:44:48,490
before.
No,

892
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,000
no,
and in it,

893
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,540
it won't.
This,

894
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,380
this mode of communicating will not go
away.

895
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,710
It'll just get faster.
It will,

896
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,820
it will become a lot more connected and
that's why our work is so critical to

897
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:06,690
figure out some of the dynamics at play
that,

898
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,370
that,
um,

899
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,990
that make it a,
that,

900
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,980
that caused more negative outcomes and
positive outcomes.

901
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,980
I,
I think about it because,

902
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,880
uh,
well I think about it because it's,

903
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:24,150
it's just a hugely significant thing,
but I also think about it because of

904
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:28,680
podcasts because podcasts are in a
similar way,

905
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:33,450
just no one saw it coming and the people
that are involved in that are like,

906
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:34,750
what the fuck are we doing now?

907
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,910
Like me,
I'm like,

908
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:36,810
what am I doing?
Like,

909
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:37,830
what is this?
No,

910
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,000
like for me,
it's like,

911
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,330
oh boy,
I get to talk to guys like Ben

912
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,140
Greenfield and,
and Jonathan Haidt and all the,

913
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,980
all these different people and learn
some stuff.

914
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:52,190
And I've have clearly learned way more
from doing this podcast than I ever

915
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:55,440
would have learned without it.
No doubt about it unquestionably.

916
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,930
But I didn't,
I didn't fucking plan as.

917
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:03,170
So now all of a sudden there is this a
signal that I'm sending out to millions

918
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,400
and millions of people and then people
are like,

919
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:06,540
well,
you have a responsibility.

920
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:07,650
I'm like,
oh great.

921
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,680
Why didn't want that?
I didn't want to responsibility to what,

922
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,050
what I distribute.
I just wanted to be able to have a freak

923
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:15,380
show.
Just talk to people like what?

924
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:15,931
Whatever.
You know,

925
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:19,050
like there's certain people that will
have on whether it's Alex Jones or

926
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,440
anyone that's controversial where people
will get fucking mad.

927
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,540
Why are you giving this person a
platform?

928
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:25,763
I go,
okay,

929
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,830
I didn't think about it that way and I
don't think that's what I'm doing.

930
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:30,660
I think I'm talking to people and you
can listen.

931
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,820
Yeah.
But it's giving that person a platform

932
00:46:32,821 --> 00:46:33,780
because they say,
well no,

933
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:36,000
they'll tone down there like Milo
Yiannopoulos.

934
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,380
That was one of the arguments people
gave me,

935
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:41,040
like he toned down his platform when he
was on your show so you could get more

936
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,810
people to pay attention to them.
Like,

937
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:45,890
okay.
But he also talked about he,

938
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:48,300
he.
That was one of the reasons why he was

939
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:53,250
exposed was my show because he talked
about that it's okay to have sex with

940
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,080
underage boys if they're gay because
there like a mentor relationship between

941
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,700
the older gay man,
the young and people were like,

942
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:04,120
what the fuck are you talking about?
And that was a big part of why he's kind

943
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,930
of been removed from the public
conversation.

944
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,890
That was one of the thing.
And then there's the discussion like,

945
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:13,320
well what is that?
What is removing someone from the public

946
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:17,650
conversation if someone is very popular
and they have all these people that like

947
00:47:17,651 --> 00:47:20,580
to listen to them.
Like what is the responsibility of these

948
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:22,710
platforms,
whether it's youtube or twitter or,

949
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,030
or anyone know what is their
responsibility to decide whether or not

950
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:30,190
someone should or shouldn't be able to
speak.

951
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,120
And this is a thing that I've been
struggling with and I've been.

952
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:37,720
I bounced around inside my own head and
I see that you guys struggle with it and

953
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,390
pretty much everyone does.
Youtube does.

954
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,063
And it's,
um,

955
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:47,320
it,
it is a hugely significant discussion

956
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:52,090
that is left to a very relatively small
amount of people.

957
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,710
And this is why this discussion of what
is social media,

958
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,340
is it something that everybody has a
right to or is it something that should

959
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:05,341
be restricted to only people that are
willing to behave and carry themselves

960
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:10,510
in a certain way?
I believe it's something that everyone

961
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:13,660
has a right to everyone has a right to,
but you still banned people,

962
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,640
like say like,
like Alex Jones,

963
00:48:15,641 --> 00:48:18,370
you guys were the last guys to keep Alex
Jones on the platform.

964
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,540
You were the last ones and I believe you
hung in there until he started harassing

965
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:23,530
you personally,
right?

966
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,433
No,
no,

967
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,240
he,
he did come your house.

968
00:48:26,241 --> 00:48:29,000
He begged.
He uh,

969
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:29,751
you know,
he,

970
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:32,900
he did very different things on our
platform versus the others.

971
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,840
So we saw this domino effect over a
weekend of one platform,

972
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,660
a Banningham and then another,
another,

973
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:43,880
another very,
very quick succession.

974
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:48,770
And you know,
people I think would have assumed that

975
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:52,340
we would just have followed suit,
but he didn't violate our terms of

976
00:48:52,341 --> 00:48:56,960
service.
And afterwards he did.

977
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,310
And,
and we have,

978
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,240
you know,
we have a,

979
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,460
we have a policy and if,
if,

980
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:02,420
uh,
you know,

981
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,620
the,
there was a violation,

982
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:08,621
we take enforcement actions.
One might be asking the account holder

983
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:12,710
to delete the tweet,
another might be a temporary suspension,

984
00:49:12,711 --> 00:49:15,020
another might be a permanent suspension.

985
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:19,120
So were you saying the solar,
let's use it in terms of like him saying

986
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:22,120
that Sandy Hook was fake.
He did not say that on the platform.

987
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,850
He did not say that on twitter.
He always said that on his show.

988
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,680
I don't know.
I don't know all the mediums he set it

989
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:28,610
in.
What did he do?

990
00:49:28,611 --> 00:49:33,611
What we're looking at is the,
is the conduct and what he did on our,

991
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,040
our platform.
So what did he do on your platform that

992
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:38,800
was like,
that you all were in agreement that this

993
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:39,634
is enough?

994
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,380
Uh,
I'm not,

995
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:43,620
I'm not sure what the,
what the actual like,

996
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,410
you know,
violations were.

997
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,930
But we have a,
we have a set number of actions and if

998
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:51,980
they keep getting,
if,

999
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:56,380
if,
if an account keeps violent in terms of

1000
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:58,570
service,
ultimately it leads to permanent

1001
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:00,670
suspension.
And when all the other platforms we're

1002
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:02,920
taking them off,
we didn't find those.

1003
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,320
We didn't.
We didn't find those violations and they

1004
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:06,760
weren't reported.
But again,

1005
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:11,761
it goes back to a lot of our model,
people weren't reporting a lot of the

1006
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:17,191
tweets that may have been in violation
on our service and we didn't act on

1007
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:18,730
them.

1008
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,260
Right.
I'm like a good instances.

1009
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,790
What's going on with Patrion?
I'm sure you're aware of the Sargon of

1010
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:29,330
cod thing.
He did a podcast a long time ago,

1011
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,900
I believe,
six months or so ago where he used the n

1012
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:37,901
word and the way he used it as a
actually against white nationalists and

1013
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:45,341
he also said a bunch of other stuff and
they decided Patriot undecided that what

1014
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:50,711
he said on a podcast was enough for them
to remove him from the platform even

1015
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:53,960
though he didn't do anything on their
platform.

1016
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:57,680
That was agregious.
And also they had previously stated that

1017
00:50:57,681 --> 00:51:00,830
they were only judging things that
occurred on their platform.

1018
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,170
There's been a giant blow back because
of that,

1019
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:05,110
because people are saying,
well now you're.

1020
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:09,200
You're essentially policing and not
based on his actions.

1021
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:13,490
Just on concepts and the communication
that he was using,

1022
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,840
the way he was talking a year,
you are eliminating him from being able

1023
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:22,841
to make a living and that you are doing
this because he does not fit into your

1024
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,060
political paradigm the way you want to
view the world.

1025
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,390
He views the world differently.
This is an opportunity for you to

1026
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:30,980
eliminate someone who you disagree with.

1027
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,650
Yeah,
I mean I don't know the nuances of their

1028
00:51:34,651 --> 00:51:37,590
policy,
but like we have to pay attention to

1029
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,160
folks who are using twitter to shut down
the voices of others.

1030
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,270
Right.
That's where it gets weaponized and we

1031
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,010
also have to pay attention to where
people are using it that put other folks

1032
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:55,011
in physical danger and that is where we
need to be most severe,

1033
00:51:55,291 --> 00:52:00,291
but otherwise everyone has a right to
these technologies and I think they also

1034
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:05,661
have a right to make sure that they have
a very simple and open read of the rules

1035
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:10,710
and we're not in a great state.
There are rules and our enforcement can

1036
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,330
be extremely confusing to people.

1037
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,800
What has been the one thing that came up
that was perhaps the most controversial,

1038
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:21,801
like I know my friend Sam Harris was
trying to get you guys to ban Donald

1039
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,060
Trump.
He was saying if the fall,

1040
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,490
your terms of service.
I just did a podcast with him.

1041
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,540
Actually,
you should come out today or tomorrow.

1042
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,610
He's.
He's.

1043
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,010
He's a fascinating guy.
Sam Harris.

1044
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:35,010
I love him to death,
but what he was trying to do is like

1045
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:35,700
saying,
hey,

1046
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,940
he's threatening nuclear war.
Like he's saying,

1047
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,640
Hey Korea,
my bombs are bigger than your bombs.

1048
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:45,870
Like what else does the guy have to do
to get you to remove them from the

1049
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,610
platform?
When you guys saw that,

1050
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:51,390
what was your reaction to that?
Was there an internal discussion about

1051
00:52:51,391 --> 00:52:53,880
actually banning the president of United
States?

1052
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,940
Well,
so the two things there.

1053
00:52:56,941 --> 00:53:01,941
One,
it was the context that presidents of

1054
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:05,970
this country have you similar language
in different mediums.

1055
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,590
They use it on radio,
they use it on television.

1056
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:14,730
It's not just through twitter and even
if you were looking at you were to look

1057
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:19,590
at the presidency of Obama.
It wasn't exactly the same tone in this

1058
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,460
exact same language,
but there were threats around the same

1059
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:27,420
country and we to take that context into
consideration.

1060
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,450
So the second thing is that we need the
most controversial aspect of our rules

1061
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:39,140
and our terms of services.
Probably the claws around public

1062
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:44,781
interest in newsworthiness where I'm
powerful figures are public figures,

1063
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:49,770
might be in violation of our terms of
service,

1064
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:54,690
but the tweet itself is of public
interest.

1065
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,600
Yes,
there should be a conversation around it

1066
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:03,260
and that is probably the thing that
people disagree with the most.

1067
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,870
Um,
and where we have a lot of internal

1068
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:09,780
debate,
but we also have some pretty hard lines.

1069
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:12,870
If we had a global leader,
including the president of United

1070
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,240
States,
make a violent threat against a private

1071
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:17,280
individual,
we would take action.

1072
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,730
We,
we always have to balance that with

1073
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:21,564
like,
is this a,

1074
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,230
is this something that the public has
interest in?

1075
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,260
In I,
I believe generally the answer is yes.

1076
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:30,510
It's not going to be in every case,
but generally the answer is yes.

1077
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:35,511
Because we should see how our leaders
think and how they act in essentially

1078
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:40,170
forms voting that informs the
conversation.

1079
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:42,270
Then forms whether we think they're
going to,

1080
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,610
they're doing the right job or we think
that,

1081
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,873
you know,
they should be,

1082
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:47,490
they should be voted out well.

1083
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:53,230
It's very important to see how someone
uses that platform and when someone uses

1084
00:54:53,601 --> 00:54:57,740
it the way he uses it and then becomes
president and continues to use it that

1085
00:54:57,741 --> 00:54:58,820
way.
That's when people are like,

1086
00:54:58,821 --> 00:55:00,780
what?
He's been consistent and I think he,

1087
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:01,600
I think he joined

1088
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,320
then in 2009,
2012 and you look at all of his tweets

1089
00:55:05,321 --> 00:55:07,420
all the way back then.
And it's pretty consistent.

1090
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,300
Yeah.
Being he likes to insult people on

1091
00:55:10,301 --> 00:55:11,860
twitter.
It's fun for him.

1092
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:12,920
He does.
It's just.

1093
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,830
I never thought he would keep doing it.
I thought once he became president maybe

1094
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,330
just lock it down and try to do a good
job for the country and then,

1095
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:22,000
you know,
after four years or eight years,

1096
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,970
just go back to his old self,
fuck you fuck the world.

1097
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:26,770
Fuck this.
But no,

1098
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,730
he's,
he's,

1099
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,020
he's just,
it's just in one way it's hilarious.

1100
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:35,620
See as a comedian,
I think it's awesome because it's just,

1101
00:55:35,621 --> 00:55:39,520
it's so hilariously stupid.
It's so preposterous.

1102
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:44,670
That even has the time to talk about
Jeff Bezos is a fair and the fact that

1103
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:47,830
he got caught with the national
enquirer,

1104
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:50,120
getting text messages and calls him Jeff
Bozos like,

1105
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,750
don't you have shit to do man?
As.

1106
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,490
But as a comedian,
I,

1107
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,850
I,
I am a gigantic fan of folly.

1108
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,530
Almost a against my better judgment.
I like watching.

1109
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:03,520
It's,
I,

1110
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,590
I've watched.
I like watching disasters.

1111
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,520
I like watching chaos.
When I see nonsense like that,

1112
00:56:08,521 --> 00:56:09,610
I'm like,
oh Jesus,

1113
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,380
I'm drawn like a motto flame.
But on the other part of me is like,

1114
00:56:14,381 --> 00:56:19,381
man,
this sets a very bizarre tone for the

1115
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:24,600
entire country because one of the things
about like Obama or hate Obama as he was

1116
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:28,360
very measured,
very articulate,

1117
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:33,390
obviously very well educated,
and I think that that aspect of his

1118
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:38,620
presidency was very good for all of us
because he represented something that

1119
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:43,520
was of a very high standard in terms of
his ability to communicate his access to

1120
00:56:43,521 --> 00:56:47,170
words,
the way the way measured his words and

1121
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:50,170
held himself.
I think that that's good for us.

1122
00:56:50,171 --> 00:56:51,400
Let's just parishioner.
Well it's.

1123
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:51,941
Yeah.
It's like,

1124
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:54,160
look at that guy.
He's better than me.

1125
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,060
That's why he's the president.
But you know,

1126
00:56:56,070 --> 00:57:00,040
you lady see trump,
he doesn't talk better than me.

1127
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:03,520
He does.
He doesn't use twitter better.

1128
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,400
He's not.
He's just this fucking madman.

1129
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,780
But isn't an important to understand
that and to see it.

1130
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,550
Hopefully that informs opinions and
actions 100 percent.

1131
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,190
That's my point.
That's my point is that this is this

1132
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:20,191
weird gray area where I think overall I
definitely support your decision to not,

1133
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,490
not banned him for violating your terms
of service.

1134
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,130
We need to know,
yeah,

1135
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,450
you know,
and it's

1136
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,400
how do you know,
how many accounts are bots,

1137
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:36,040
how many [inaudible] do you know,
how many accounts are from a Russian

1138
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:37,990
troll farm,
how do you know that?

1139
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,350
So this is a real challenge and
something that we're,

1140
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,530
uh,
we're trying to wrap our heads around,

1141
00:57:43,531 --> 00:57:47,910
but one of the things we're trying to do
is like let's scope the problem down a

1142
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:50,010
bit and let,
let's use the technology we have

1143
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:51,960
available to us.
Like face Id,

1144
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:55,260
touch id,
like the biometric stuff to identify the

1145
00:57:55,261 --> 00:57:56,094
humans.

1146
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:59,880
Let's identify the humans first APP
because it face id is not really

1147
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,290
available.
Is it available to you guys?

1148
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:02,540
Did you know you just leave leaks?

1149
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,360
We shouldn't have done that.
No,

1150
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,230
we haven't.
We haven't used it yet.

1151
00:58:06,231 --> 00:58:11,231
But you can use it for things like,
is this like a human operating this say

1152
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:12,990
you can use it for that.
So it's,

1153
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,440
it's completely locked into the local
device.

1154
00:58:15,441 --> 00:58:17,760
We don't have access to images of your
face or whatnot,

1155
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:22,780
but the operating system can tell us
that this is the legit owner of this

1156
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:28,850
phone and therefore it is,
it is human and technology always has to

1157
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:30,560
change.
People will find ways around that and

1158
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:34,220
whatnot.
But if we go the opposite direction and

1159
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,070
we look for the bots,
the problem with looking for the bots

1160
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:39,140
boxes,
people assume that they just come

1161
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:44,141
through our api,
but the scripting has become extremely

1162
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:46,740
sophisticated.
People can script the APP,

1163
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,860
can script the website and make it look
very,

1164
00:58:48,861 --> 00:58:53,420
very human.
So we're going after this problem first

1165
00:58:53,421 --> 00:58:56,540
trying to identify the humans as much as
we can.

1166
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,240
Utilizing these technologies,
you know,

1167
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,140
of this is live right now.
These are,

1168
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:03,530
these are considerations that we're
making and trying to understand like

1169
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:04,960
what the impact would be and,
and,

1170
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:06,470
uh,
how we might evolve it,

1171
00:59:06,471 --> 00:59:11,471
but we need to because that information
would provide context for someone like

1172
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:16,790
this is an actual human that I'm talking
to and I can invest more time in it

1173
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:19,670
where I can just ignore the thing
because it's meaningless.

1174
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:23,190
Now is apple to share that with you,
I mean when you,

1175
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:26,240
when you're talking about biometrics,
fingerprints or face,

1176
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:30,850
it's not the data,
it's just the operating system verifies

1177
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:34,280
that there's an individual as an
individual and it's unlocking know,

1178
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,410
like,
like,

1179
00:59:35,411 --> 00:59:36,131
um,
you know,

1180
00:59:36,131 --> 00:59:37,840
when,
when you use the,

1181
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,760
um,
our cash app uses us,

1182
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:40,510
right?
So squares,

1183
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,080
cash APP.
When you want to make a transfer to

1184
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,440
someone when you want to send someone
money or when you want to buy Bitcoin,

1185
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,340
we turn on face id and you verify that
you are,

1186
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:55,120
you and you are the owner of the phone
and then it goes.

1187
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:58,810
We don't get images of your face.
We don't see who you are.

1188
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,250
Oh,
that's what you want me to think.

1189
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,690
I know
that's how locked down by the operating

1190
01:00:04,691 --> 01:00:06,330
system and that's what it should be,
right?

1191
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,580
Sure.
Um,

1192
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,940
what,
has there ever been any consideration to

1193
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:14,941
not allowing people to post anonymously?
Well,

1194
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,790
like what you said earlier about
journalists and whistleblowers that is

1195
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,560
political.

1196
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:24,520
So look at a look at platforms that have
a real names policy.

1197
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,830
Look at facebook or other problems.
Any different.

1198
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:31,540
I don't know because I don't go there,
but for I understand there's a lot of

1199
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:34,930
still a lot of arguing there.
It's the same at a political argument if

1200
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,540
the same vectors,
same patterns.

1201
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,660
I think older,
like older in general it seems.

1202
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:44,470
I also am not really hanging out there,
but it seems a little bit older.

1203
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,720
It's a lot of grammys looking at
pictures of their kids,

1204
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,710
grandkids and stuff and that's what it
was made for about.

1205
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,330
It's connecting,
it's connecting with the people that you

1206
01:00:52,331 --> 01:00:54,790
know and that to me is the biggest
difference for twitter.

1207
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:57,490
It's connecting with the people you
don't know what they find interesting

1208
01:00:57,491 --> 01:01:00,070
and like it's around.
It's around topics and stuff that you

1209
01:01:00,071 --> 01:01:02,120
find that you want to learn more about
when you saw it.

1210
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:07,180
Zuckerberg testifying and in,
in realizing like how this platform is

1211
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,070
being used and what are the dangers of
this,

1212
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:14,210
and then you see these senators that
really don't know what the fuck the

1213
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:19,211
technology is or it's wow,
it really highlights how we're set up to

1214
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,080
this.
Really.

1215
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,010
Yeah.
Well,

1216
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,610
not just a gap,
a gap in the critical understanding of

1217
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:30,611
how these things work and what they are
in terms of how these really important

1218
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:35,750
politicians who are the ones who are
making these decisions as to whether or

1219
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:40,580
not someone has violated laws or whether
or not something should be curbed or

1220
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:42,980
regulated.
They don't really even understand what

1221
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:43,814
they're talking about.

1222
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,310
No,
I mean there's,

1223
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,530
there's a few people do because they're
not,

1224
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,980
they're not using it directly.
They're not using in the way that people

1225
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:55,190
are using it every single day and I'll
have the same experience that people

1226
01:01:55,490 --> 01:02:00,490
have every single day and you know,
in terms of regulatory and our

1227
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:04,070
regulators and our government's.
I,

1228
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:04,904
you know,
we,

1229
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,470
I think the conversation is often about
how regulators will come in and start

1230
01:02:09,471 --> 01:02:12,650
writing rules and,
and setting expectations for how

1231
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:16,880
companies or services might behave,
but there's a role for the company to

1232
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:18,830
educate and there's a role for the
company to,

1233
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:24,260
on like what technology makes possible,
whether it be positive and also some of

1234
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:26,880
the negatives.
So that become possible as well.

1235
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:30,750
So I think we have a role to help
educate and to,

1236
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:35,100
and to help make sure that we're really,
we're,

1237
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:37,230
we're,
we're pushing towards what I think the

1238
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:40,290
job of regular regulator is,
which is number one,

1239
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:44,790
protect the individual number to level
the playing field and make sure that

1240
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:49,560
those two things are not compromised by
special interests trying to protect

1241
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:54,561
their own domain or profits or,
or a dominance within a particular

1242
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:55,440
market.

1243
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,420
What do you mean by level?
The playing field level,

1244
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:02,530
the playing field so that a,
an individual has the same opportunity,

1245
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,470
uh,
that uh,

1246
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,510
someone else might have or a company
might have.

1247
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,700
So.
Okay.

1248
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:09,970
So like anybody,
anyone,

1249
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,460
anyone can have a twitter account and
you know,

1250
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,290
they have,
uh,

1251
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,820
at least,
uh,

1252
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,030
you know,
an equal opportunity to contribute to it

1253
01:03:18,031 --> 01:03:21,480
and whatever they do with it will change
the change the outcome.

1254
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:25,320
Some people might become very popular
because they're saying stuff people want

1255
01:03:25,321 --> 01:03:27,420
to hear.
Some people won't see any following

1256
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:30,690
whatsoever because they're not adding
anything original or interesting or,

1257
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,160
or,
uh,

1258
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,050
we're different in terms of perspective.

1259
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,400
Where do you see this going?
When you look at these kind of emerging

1260
01:03:38,401 --> 01:03:40,650
technologies,
not necessarily emerging anymore,

1261
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,420
established now,
but still,

1262
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,501
you know,
a,

1263
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:46,470
a new thing in relative terms of human
history,

1264
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,340
where do you see this going and does it
get more intrusive?

1265
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:52,870
Does it get deeper into our lives?
Like what,

1266
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,990
what?
And when you look at new technologies

1267
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:57,150
like augmented reality and things along
those lines,

1268
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:02,510
do you see new possibilities and new
things to make things even more

1269
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:03,564
complicated?

1270
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:05,801
I mean,
yeah,

1271
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:09,930
I mean we just have to assume the,
we,

1272
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,950
we naturally use more and more
technologies.

1273
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:15,790
More and more things become open.
More and more things,

1274
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,370
uh,
increase their velocity.

1275
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,750
There's more communication,
not less like this is not going away and

1276
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,570
it's just,
it's just a question of what we do with

1277
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:26,400
it.
So where,

1278
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,020
where I want it to go as an where I want
twitter specifically to go is I,

1279
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:31,660
you know,
I,

1280
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:35,300
I think it's existential right now that
we,

1281
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,130
we,
we have global conversations about some

1282
01:04:39,131 --> 01:04:43,960
things that will become crisis climate
change being one of them.

1283
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:47,260
There was no one nation state that's
going to solve that problem alone.

1284
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,800
Economic disparity being another,
the the rise of Ai and a job

1285
01:04:53,381 --> 01:04:57,190
displacement and just like us offloading
decisions to these,

1286
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,660
to these algorithms,
those are the things that,

1287
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,610
that no one nation,
no one community is going to solve

1288
01:05:03,611 --> 01:05:05,650
alone.
It takes the entire world to do so,

1289
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:10,651
so I want to make sure that we're doing
our best to get people seeing these

1290
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,800
global conversations and ideally
participating in them because it helps.

1291
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:20,250
It helps us solve the problems.
I just believe that more open society

1292
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:24,310
allows us to solve problems much faster.

1293
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,230
So you in many ways see twitter is
having some sort of a social

1294
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:30,200
responsibility in this.

1295
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,490
Totally.
Totally.

1296
01:05:31,491 --> 01:05:32,241
Totally.
Yeah.

1297
01:05:32,241 --> 01:05:35,240
And I think a big part of is like right
now,

1298
01:05:35,241 --> 01:05:39,110
like how are we,
how are we ensuring that there is more

1299
01:05:39,111 --> 01:05:44,111
healthy contribution to that global
conversation and you know,

1300
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,480
I,
I just think it's so critical that we

1301
01:05:47,481 --> 01:05:50,210
start talking about the things that are
facing all of us,

1302
01:05:50,211 --> 01:05:54,710
not just one nation.
I do think you know that that's where

1303
01:05:54,711 --> 01:05:59,711
our current model really puts the world
at a disadvantage because it

1304
01:05:59,961 --> 01:06:03,860
incentivizes more of the elk echo
chambers,

1305
01:06:03,861 --> 01:06:07,820
which lead to things like nationalism.
Instead of taking the broader picture

1306
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:11,150
and looking at what's happening around
the world to all people,

1307
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:12,140
to all of humanity,

1308
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:17,140
what do you do though to balance the
conversation or what responsibility do

1309
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:19,630
you think you have to balance the
conversation in terms of the way

1310
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:23,080
conservatives view it versus the way
liberals and progressives view it?

1311
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,750
Balance.
It shows there,

1312
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:28,780
is there a responsibility?
Do you have a responsibility or is it

1313
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:32,440
just leave it up to the people and let
them figure it out the same way they

1314
01:06:32,441 --> 01:06:34,870
figured out hashtags and everything
else.

1315
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:38,700
I think we have a responsibility to make
it easier to do that easier.

1316
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:39,850
How so?
Right now it's just.

1317
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,260
It's just too hard.
Most most people will not venture

1318
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,330
outside their mindset.
They will.

1319
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,430
They will not venture out.
They will not break their bubble,

1320
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,870
but if you.
Because it's right now on the surface,

1321
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:53,040
it's just so hard to do that.
I,

1322
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,980
I can only follow accounts and I have
to,

1323
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,660
I have to look into and just imagine
like,

1324
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:02,880
you know,
trying to get an understanding of your

1325
01:07:02,881 --> 01:07:06,150
own politics.
People can't just look at your bio,

1326
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:07,860
they have to look through all your
tweets,

1327
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:10,020
they have to listen to a bunch of your
podcasts and whatnot.

1328
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,850
And that's a bunch of work.
If we shifted more towards topics and

1329
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:19,230
interest,
at least we have the potential to see a

1330
01:07:19,231 --> 01:07:20,950
bunch more perspectives.
We see.

1331
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:23,690
Do that.
The simplest thing as like follow a

1332
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:25,680
Hashtag,
follow a topic,

1333
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:30,260
like why can't you just follow warriors
twitter or uh,

1334
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:31,741
you know,
NBA,

1335
01:07:31,741 --> 01:07:34,380
twitter,
why do you have to go and find all the

1336
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:37,590
coaches and the players and,
and the team.

1337
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:41,370
So we can do that.
We can help make that a whole lot easier

1338
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:41,880
for folks.

1339
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,770
So there's something like brexit or
something like that.

1340
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:46,980
So if you go to Hashtag Brexit,
you're going to get the whole

1341
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:49,230
conversation.
You're going to get the pros,

1342
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,520
the cons,
the left,

1343
01:07:50,521 --> 01:07:51,810
the right,
the whole deal,

1344
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:54,270
the centrists.
You're going to get everybody versus

1345
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:58,170
following the people that you already
follow that agree with what you think

1346
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:00,590
the probability is higher that you'll
get more,

1347
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:04,460
you'll get more variety of perspectives
and not even doesn't even follow Brexit,

1348
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:09,200
follow vote leave if you want to leave,
but within that topic there might be

1349
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:13,610
some dissenting opinions and you get to
choose whether you those inform you,

1350
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:15,650
whether that emboldens your or not,

1351
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,630
but and,
and again,

1352
01:08:17,631 --> 01:08:19,580
I'm not saying that we should force that
upon it,

1353
01:08:19,581 --> 01:08:22,190
but it's not easy to even do that today,
right?

1354
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:26,740
The only tool we give you is finding and
following the accounts and that's what

1355
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,840
people search hashtags.
They do search,

1356
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:29,990
right?
They don't.

1357
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,390
They send the timeline.
I mean it is a small percentage of

1358
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:34,670
people that people that really know
twitter know how to do that,

1359
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,940
but most people,
they follow an account and they stand

1360
01:08:38,941 --> 01:08:41,780
the timeline and what their world is,
their timeline.

1361
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:45,080
Hashtags can be corrupted to totally.
They can be gamed.

1362
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:50,230
It can be gamed and taken over.
I took over Hashtag Vegan cat go to and

1363
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:51,741
what is,
what is it?

1364
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:53,270
It's a wrap.
That's mine.

1365
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:54,104
Now.

1366
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,930
My last,
my last Netflix special about a woman

1367
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:01,610
who said a bunch of horrible things to
me,

1368
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,160
uh,
because I put a picture up on instagram

1369
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:07,160
of some deer meat and I wrote this is
some meat from a deer that liked to kick

1370
01:09:07,161 --> 01:09:10,940
babies and was about to join isis.
And I wrote Hashtag Vegan,

1371
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,230
which was a mistake right to the right.
Hashtag Vegan,

1372
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:18,440
but the Hashtag Vegan people went
fucking crazy and came after me because

1373
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:23,630
I entered into their timeline with meat
hashtag vegan cat.

1374
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:28,790
It's all either pictures of see like it
says Joe Rogan right up.

1375
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:31,250
Thank you.
I haven't laughed that hard to while

1376
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,980
Hashtag Vegan cat.
It's people that are feeding their

1377
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:35,930
fucking cat vegan food and they're all
dying.

1378
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:40,490
And I in the specialist say every cat
looks like it's living in a house with a

1379
01:09:40,491 --> 01:09:43,310
gas leak.
Like they're all like laying down like

1380
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:44,390
where the fuck is the real food?

1381
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:47,260
But this is real.
Like this is just a conversation to

1382
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,103
have.
But the thing is,

1383
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:53,110
if someone does something like that,
like you can like pick a person,

1384
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,670
you know,
whatever that person is,

1385
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:56,460
whatever they're,
they're,

1386
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,420
they're doing,
if they have a Hashtag that they utilize

1387
01:09:59,421 --> 01:10:01,280
all the time for their movement or
whatever,

1388
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:04,490
someone could mock them and then use
that.

1389
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,610
And if it's a public figure or someone
who's got a prominent voice,

1390
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:11,570
then all of a sudden that Hashtag
becomes people just take it over and

1391
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:14,450
start mocking them with that Hashtag.
But it has to be done in mass.

1392
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:15,530
I mean,
it has to be coordinated.

1393
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:18,980
And sometimes people like figure out how
to gain the system and coordinate it in

1394
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:21,920
a,
amplify that message in an unfair way.

1395
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:22,910
And,
and that's what,

1396
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:24,830
that's what our systems are trying to
recognize.

1397
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,160
How sick did that cat look?

1398
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:28,790
Fucking cat.
That was a real one.

1399
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,820
That was a real Hashtag Vegan cat.
Wow.

1400
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,110
Support Bastards.
Um,

1401
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:38,120
so when you look back at emerging social
media,

1402
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:43,150
like we go all the way back to my space,
my space,

1403
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,690
you got Tom,
Tom was sitting there and you're in your

1404
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:50,030
top eight and you know,
people would like post music that they

1405
01:10:50,031 --> 01:10:55,031
liked and it was never political.
It was very often very surface.

1406
01:10:55,671 --> 01:11:00,200
And for comics it was a great way to
promote shows and it was,

1407
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,130
it was an interesting way to see things.
But it was,

1408
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:08,480
it was like,
like the seed that became twitter or

1409
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:10,970
facebook or any of these is one of them.
I think we,

1410
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,340
at least for us,
like we got more of our roots from

1411
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:18,870
aol instant messenger and Icq Icq
because it was,

1412
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:22,290
you know,
you remember the status message where

1413
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:23,920
you said like,
I'm in a meeting or I'm listening to

1414
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:27,330
music or watching a movie right now.
That was the inspiration.

1415
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:30,180
And what we took from that was being
able to,

1416
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:31,680
like,
if you could do that from anywhere,

1417
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:33,600
not bound to a desk,
but you could do that from anywhere.

1418
01:11:33,601 --> 01:11:36,030
And you could do it from your phone and
you could just be roaming around and

1419
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:37,140
say,
you know,

1420
01:11:37,141 --> 01:11:39,060
I'm at,
I'm at Joe Rogan's,

1421
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,290
um,
studio right now,

1422
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:42,510
that is cool.
I don't need my computer.

1423
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:44,670
I'm not bound to this chain,
to this desk.

1424
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:46,440
I can,
I can do it from anywhere.

1425
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:48,870
And then the other aspect of,
of,

1426
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,830
in some messenger was of course chat.
So one of the things that the status

1427
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,200
would do is you might,
you might say like,

1428
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,600
you know,
I'm listening to Kendrick Lamar right

1429
01:11:57,601 --> 01:12:00,360
now and I might hit you up on chat and
say like,

1430
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,980
what do you,
what do you think of the new album?

1431
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:06,930
But now it's all public so everyone can
see it.

1432
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,700
That's,
that's the biggest difference in the.

1433
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:10,780
And that's,
that to me is what twitter is.

1434
01:12:10,781 --> 01:12:13,830
It might,
my space was,

1435
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:18,860
it was profiles and you know,
people organized around these profiles

1436
01:12:19,171 --> 01:12:21,900
and uh,
this network that develop between

1437
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:23,730
people.
And that is facebook,

1438
01:12:23,731 --> 01:12:27,630
facebook,
facebook optimized the hell out of that.

1439
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,730
And they scaled the world.
We,

1440
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,690
we were something very different.
We,

1441
01:12:33,691 --> 01:12:34,320
you know,
we,

1442
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,940
we started with a simple status and then
people wanted to talk about it and we,

1443
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,950
we decided that it should be on the same
surface,

1444
01:12:40,951 --> 01:12:44,040
it shouldn't be suburbian to the,
to the,

1445
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:47,010
to the status,
it should be part of that flow.

1446
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:49,110
And that's what makes twitter so fluid.

1447
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:53,500
Now when you look at this sort of
metamorphosis,

1448
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:57,010
this evolution between those initial
social media,

1449
01:12:57,011 --> 01:13:01,030
whether it's aol instant messenger that
eventually became Lux Icq.

1450
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:04,960
And what was that one that we would use
that gamers would use?

1451
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:10,170
That it was like a all live stream sort
of message board

1452
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:14,340
for awhile people were using teamspeak
but I don't know.

1453
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:16,480
No it wasn't,
that wasn't,

1454
01:13:16,481 --> 01:13:20,020
that wasn't teamspeak it was.
I'm like you would go there and share

1455
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:24,130
files and stuff and people would uh,
would,

1456
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,860
would go,
like if I used to play a lot of online

1457
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:30,880
video games and we play on teams and we
have teams go play other teams and he

1458
01:13:30,881 --> 01:13:34,690
would use this sort of a.
It was like,

1459
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,720
it wasn't a message board because it was
all in real time.

1460
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,830
What the fuck was it called?
No.

1461
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:44,200
Alright,
forget it.

1462
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:45,710
Anyway,
uh,

1463
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:50,800
guys would go there and you could send
people files through it and teams would

1464
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:54,850
go and meet and it would be a chat,
like an online chat that would be in

1465
01:13:54,851 --> 01:13:55,470
real time.

1466
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:56,140
Yeah,
it's,

1467
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,410
yeah.
I mean we have a lot of our roots and

1468
01:13:58,411 --> 01:14:01,530
aol instant messenger,
but also like IRC Internet relay chat

1469
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:03,590
and use nut which were the,
you know,

1470
01:14:03,591 --> 01:14:06,570
these old internet seventies
technologies is what I was talking

1471
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:07,250
about.
IRC.

1472
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:07,771
Yeah.
Yeah.

1473
01:14:07,771 --> 01:14:08,340
Okay.
Okay.

1474
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,930
Yeah.
So Internet relay chat is,

1475
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:13,900
is like this giant room that anyone can
join and so range around topics and

1476
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:18,550
that's what's interesting about that is
you could see people typing,

1477
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,510
see it occurring in real time,
see it popping up in real time,

1478
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:22,793
you know,
I'm

1479
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:28,400
just wonder like what is the next
evolution of this?

1480
01:14:28,401 --> 01:14:32,560
Because because no one saw anything
going from ICQ to twitter,

1481
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:36,310
no one saw anything going from that to
instagram and to where we're at right

1482
01:14:36,311 --> 01:14:40,120
now where it really does flavor the
conversation of our entire culture.

1483
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,640
I mean,
before it was just a thing that was

1484
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:44,620
happening that was happening on people's
computers.

1485
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:48,490
Now it's a thing that's happening on
people's computers and now phones and

1486
01:14:48,491 --> 01:14:51,090
now your whole life.
It's a,

1487
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,010
it's,
it's a very different influence and I

1488
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:58,150
wonder because everything does
accelerate things constantly move

1489
01:14:58,151 --> 01:15:03,151
forward and become more and more,
more and more integrated into our life

1490
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:07,690
experience.
And I wonder what is the next stage of

1491
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:08,524
this

1492
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:12,620
if I mean like the,
the secular trends and you know,

1493
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:16,120
you look at technology and you look at
technologies like blockchain for

1494
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:17,800
instance,
and I think,

1495
01:15:17,801 --> 01:15:18,340
you know,
we're,

1496
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,820
we're moving to a world where anything
created exists forever,

1497
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:26,200
um,
that there's no centralized control over

1498
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,170
who sees what,
um,

1499
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:30,520
that,
uh,

1500
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:31,360
you know,
these,

1501
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,450
these,
these models become completely

1502
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:38,590
decentralized and all these barriers
that we,

1503
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:43,060
that exist today aren't as important
anymore.

1504
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:49,100
Something like Gab,
Gab seems to be a response to the fact

1505
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:52,600
that some people are getting banned from
other platforms and they're just

1506
01:15:52,601 --> 01:15:54,760
allowing anybody to come on and say
anything they want.

1507
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,270
The downside of that is,
of course the most horrible people are

1508
01:15:58,271 --> 01:16:01,750
going to be able to say anything they
want with no repercussions.

1509
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:04,660
The good side is anybody can say
whatever they want.

1510
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,910
Yeah.
I haven't studied them too much,

1511
01:16:06,911 --> 01:16:09,640
but I do know that they have taken
action on accounts as well.

1512
01:16:09,641 --> 01:16:13,810
They have suspended accounts and they,
if they have a terms of service as well,

1513
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,790
what are they suspended accounts for it.
I don't know.

1514
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:18,400
It's probably conduct related.
It's probably,

1515
01:16:18,401 --> 01:16:21,160
it might be doxing.
I'm probably right,

1516
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:23,200
but it's just a,
it's just a question of like,

1517
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:25,630
you know,
the rules and if you agree to the rules

1518
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:30,631
then you sign up for the service and if,
if not there will be other services.

1519
01:16:32,351 --> 01:16:37,351
But like if you look at,
you look at the trends and I think um,

1520
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:41,470
you know,
certainly things become a lot more

1521
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:44,650
public and certainly things become a lot
more open.

1522
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:49,570
Certainly the berries and the boundaries
that we have in place today become less

1523
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:53,410
meaningful and I think there's a lot of
positives in that.

1524
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,840
And I,
I also think there's a lot of danger

1525
01:16:55,841 --> 01:16:58,520
that we need to be mindful of.
Now you as a ceo,

1526
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:01,020
oh,
as a guy who's running this thing,

1527
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,060
what,
what is this?

1528
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:05,970
Is the experience been like for you?
Because I got to imagine that it wasn't

1529
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,090
anything that you predicted.
No.

1530
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,063
Predicted twitter,

1531
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,640
right?
Yeah.

1532
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,220
So to all the sudden have this
responsibility,

1533
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,840
what are changing everything.
I mean it.

1534
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,640
And you're a young guy.
How old are you?

1535
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,780
Forty two.
That's young to be in control of that

1536
01:17:20,781 --> 01:17:25,781
much and to have it over the time of
what has it been 11 years or 10 years

1537
01:17:27,321 --> 01:17:28,540
old?
They're 13 and Marcela.

1538
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,500
Yeah.
So you were really fucking young,

1539
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:34,930
like what has that been like for you?
It's been a,

1540
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:39,800
it's been both beautiful and scary and
uncomfortable and learning.

1541
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,940
It's just been a ton of learning and
evolving and it shows me every single

1542
01:17:43,941 --> 01:17:47,960
day where I need to push myself and what
I don't know.

1543
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:52,070
And uh,
and I think a big part is just the

1544
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:53,900
realization that we're not gonna be able
to do this alone.

1545
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:55,790
And I don't think we have to either the,
these are,

1546
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:58,250
these are what the technologies that
continue to allow us,

1547
01:17:58,251 --> 01:18:01,910
we can,
if we have to have all the answers

1548
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:06,890
around enforcement or policy when we're
not going to serve the world,

1549
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:10,640
we have aspirations to serve every
single person on the planet and we have

1550
01:18:10,641 --> 01:18:12,670
aspirations to,
you know,

1551
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:17,030
be the first consideration for the
global public conversation.

1552
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,040
And you know,
if,

1553
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:23,000
if we're the bottleneck for all this,
we're not going to reach those

1554
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:26,600
aspirations.
So it just thinking deeply about how we

1555
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:31,601
might distribute more of this work and
decentralize more of it and look at look

1556
01:18:32,901 --> 01:18:37,901
at the platform itself and like what we
need to change to reach that reality.

1557
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:40,630
And I think we got to look really
deepened.

1558
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:43,200
Foundational that it goes back to,
you know,

1559
01:18:43,201 --> 01:18:43,870
the,
the,

1560
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:46,940
your question on 1:40,
one of the things that we saw was,

1561
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,160
you know,
we,

1562
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,850
we shifted to 280 characters and that,
you know,

1563
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:53,790
there's 140 characters is so sacred.
You know,

1564
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:57,650
it,
it became this cultural thing and I was

1565
01:18:57,651 --> 01:18:59,540
in love with it.
And so many people are in love with it,

1566
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:05,350
but one of the things we noticed as we
move to two 80 is that the vast majority

1567
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:10,970
of tweets that are broadcasts don't go
above 1:40 even with that limitation

1568
01:19:10,971 --> 01:19:14,870
raced,
but where they do go above a 1:40 is in

1569
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:19,430
replies when people reply,
they tend to go over the hundred 40

1570
01:19:19,431 --> 01:19:24,330
character limit and even bump up into
the two to 80 limit and what it allowed,

1571
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:28,520
what we've seen it allow us just more
nuance in the conversation and allows

1572
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:31,490
people to give more context and,
and uh,

1573
01:19:31,491 --> 01:19:34,670
and kind of just get their experience on
the table a little bit more,

1574
01:19:34,671 --> 01:19:37,190
whereas 1:40 did not allow that.

1575
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:41,600
So we,
we have seen that increase the health of

1576
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,710
those conversations and the discussion.
So it's stuff like that that we need to

1577
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:46,850
question and not hold.
So,

1578
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,460
so sacred.
Is there any consideration to expanding

1579
01:19:49,461 --> 01:19:51,030
it further?
Uh,

1580
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,000
now,
right now we were about a million

1581
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:54,540
characters.
I know.

1582
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:57,380
Well,
we don't have edit tweets right now.

1583
01:19:57,381 --> 01:19:59,240
So we did.
That's good or bad.

1584
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,880
Well,
if you can't edit a 140 characters,

1585
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:04,880
you're going to be really pissed off if
you write a million characters in cad.

1586
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,350
Those things,
you know what I would like,

1587
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,780
I would like the ability to edit,
like if you make a typo or something

1588
01:20:09,781 --> 01:20:12,000
like that,
but also the ability for people to see

1589
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:14,860
the original like edit,
but see the original.

1590
01:20:14,861 --> 01:20:17,250
Let's say we're looking at exactly that.
Oh really?

1591
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:19,350
We're looking at exactly that.
The reason we don't have it in the first

1592
01:20:19,351 --> 01:20:23,130
place is we were born on sms,
were born on text messaging.

1593
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:24,690
When you send a tax,
you can't take it back.

1594
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,910
Right?
So when you send a tweet,

1595
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,300
it goes to the world instantaneously.
You can't take it back.

1596
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,910
So when we have to exist anyway,
I mean,

1597
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,800
no matter what,
if you send someone something,

1598
01:20:34,801 --> 01:20:37,740
even if you're on Instagram,
people are gonna know the original.

1599
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:39,810
Yeah,
they screenshot it and they do their

1600
01:20:39,811 --> 01:20:42,660
thing,
but like you could build it such that,

1601
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:46,380
you know,
maybe we introduce a five second to 32nd

1602
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:50,220
delay in the sending and within that
window you can edit.

1603
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,650
I'm going to need more time than that.
Do it.

1604
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:56,010
If I fucked something up,
I like someone has to tell me,

1605
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,950
but did you misspelled that word?
Oh Shit.

1606
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,370
Did I?
God Damn it.

1607
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,730
The issue.
Autocorrect gets you totally,

1608
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:04,290
but the issue with going longer than
that,

1609
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,410
it takes that real time.
Nature of the conversation will flow out

1610
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:08,244
of it.

1611
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,820
Then we're delaying these tweets and
like when you're watching UFC,

1612
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:13,590
are you watching like warriors
basketball?

1613
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,680
A lot of.
A lot of the great twitter is just like

1614
01:21:16,681 --> 01:21:18,180
in the moment,
just like you know,

1615
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:19,950
it's the roar of the crowd.
It's like,

1616
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:22,950
you know,
looking across a at someone you're in

1617
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:24,750
this virtual stadium with and just
saying like,

1618
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,190
oh my God,
that shot.

1619
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:30,420
Can you believe it?
But this isn't clarity more important

1620
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:33,370
because you're not.
It depends on the context that you still

1621
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:37,530
have the ability to communicate quickly,
but you also have the ability to

1622
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:38,420
clarify.
That's,

1623
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:41,970
that's where we need to really pay
attention because

1624
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:46,320
if you're,
if you're in the context of an NBA game,

1625
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:49,320
you want to be fast and you just won't
be able to moment and you just,

1626
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:51,750
you don't want to be raw,
but if you're in the context of

1627
01:21:51,751 --> 01:21:55,800
considering what the president just did
or making a particular statement,

1628
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:59,820
then you probably need some,
some more time and we can be dynamic

1629
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:00,180
there.

1630
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,700
What's interesting to me is how few
people use video.

1631
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:06,480
Like I thought when you guys have video
on twitter,

1632
01:22:06,481 --> 01:22:06,871
I'm like,
wow,

1633
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:10,290
a bunch of people going to be making
videos and putting those up on twitter

1634
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,540
and it's not,
it's not that often.

1635
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,290
It depends on who you follow it.
It's huge for some aspects of twitter.

1636
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:16,860
It's,
it's,

1637
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,330
uh,
it's less so in others,

1638
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,540
but aspects is huge for um,
a lot,

1639
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:24,060
a lot of sports.
I mean we see a lot of like just the

1640
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:27,210
replays and the recaps for sure,
you know,

1641
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:30,300
aspects of a,
of a particular shot that people want to

1642
01:22:30,301 --> 01:22:31,740
comment on.
I don't like.

1643
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:35,430
I think it's dangerous for us to focus
too much on the medium,

1644
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:38,970
whether it be images or gifts or video.
It's,

1645
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,420
it's more about the conversation around
it.

1646
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:44,220
That's what we want to optimize for.
It's definitely very popular for sports

1647
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:46,200
and,
and folly.

1648
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:47,520
And you know,
there's uh,

1649
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,833
what is,
uh,

1650
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:51,570
there's,
there's a bunch of animal attack videos.

1651
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:56,550
Yeah.
Nature is metals a good one and hold my

1652
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:58,710
beer.
That's another good one.

1653
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:02,640
I mean it's all videos,
but what I meant was people making a

1654
01:23:02,641 --> 01:23:06,220
video talking about something.
This is what I was trying

1655
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,470
to say,
what I think is this and that and blah

1656
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:10,600
blah blah.
You don't see a lot of that.

1657
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:13,540
And I thought maybe that would be
something that people would adopt more.

1658
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,120
Two different speed.
I think like the,

1659
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,120
the consumption of video.
I mean you see this in the technology

1660
01:23:19,121 --> 01:23:21,760
right now,
like people are subtitling every single

1661
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:25,210
video because people might be in an
environment where they can't turn the

1662
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:30,040
audio on or like a video like I have to
scrub through to see what's interesting

1663
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:33,340
like it with text.
I can just see it and it allows for a

1664
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,940
lot of serendipity to find something
that I probably wouldn't have seen

1665
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,890
unless I watched the whole damn video.
So like the ability to clip something,

1666
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:44,350
the ability to like index in I think is
really critical.

1667
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:45,580
So it's not,
to me,

1668
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:48,430
it's not about the format,
it's about the use case in the context

1669
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:49,264
that you're in

1670
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,220
now.
Going back to the responsibility that

1671
01:23:52,221 --> 01:23:57,221
you guys have and you in particular,
like when this became what it is now and

1672
01:23:59,391 --> 01:24:04,391
when it became evident that it became
this gigantic way of changing the way

1673
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:07,700
human beings communicate with each
other.

1674
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:12,860
Was there ever any regret or was there a
moment where you're like,

1675
01:24:12,861 --> 01:24:15,110
what the fuck have I gotten myself into?

1676
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:17,823
I mean,
um,

1677
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:23,320
there's um,
always reflective of where I am and what

1678
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:25,220
I'm doing.
Um,

1679
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:28,570
I think the,
the biggest has been around,

1680
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,970
um,
twofold.

1681
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:35,971
One,
how the dynamics of the service allow it

1682
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:40,420
to be weaponized in order to silence
someone else or to drive them off the

1683
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:44,080
surface entirely,
which goes against the entire concept of

1684
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:47,120
free speech and free participation.
Like we,

1685
01:24:47,121 --> 01:24:50,440
we,
we just can't stand for that.

1686
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:50,941
We,
we,

1687
01:24:50,941 --> 01:24:55,480
we need to make sure that everyone feels
that they have an opportunity at a voice

1688
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:57,940
and when you have these coordinated
attacks,

1689
01:24:57,941 --> 01:24:58,481
it,
it just,

1690
01:24:58,481 --> 01:25:01,870
it's not fair.
The second is around,

1691
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:02,650
you know,
this,

1692
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:04,870
this concept of an echo chamber and the
filter bubble.

1693
01:25:04,871 --> 01:25:05,471
I,
I just,

1694
01:25:05,471 --> 01:25:08,560
I don't feel personally good about that.
I don't feel.

1695
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:13,600
I don't feel I'm,
that we thought that through enough.

1696
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:17,310
In the early days,
I think we should have moved a,

1697
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,520
towards biasing the service towards
topics and interests much,

1698
01:25:21,521 --> 01:25:24,370
much sooner than we are now considering
doing

1699
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,130
no.
When you have these considerations,

1700
01:25:26,131 --> 01:25:29,550
when you take these actions,
do you consult with psychologists or

1701
01:25:29,551 --> 01:25:34,500
sociologists or historians or people
that try to put in perspective for you?

1702
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:37,500
What the ramifications of each
individual move would be?

1703
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:41,430
I try to read as much as possible.
I try to talk to as many people as

1704
01:25:41,431 --> 01:25:43,080
possible.
Just get completely different

1705
01:25:43,081 --> 01:25:45,870
perspective.
And is there any internal disagreement

1706
01:25:45,871 --> 01:25:47,790
about actions that you take?
Oh yeah.

1707
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:48,810
There's,
there's always,

1708
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,790
there's always debate,
there's always debate,

1709
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:54,630
but I think my role is to ask,
ask questions and make sure like,

1710
01:25:54,631 --> 01:25:56,520
are like what,
what is our goal here?

1711
01:25:56,521 --> 01:25:58,860
What are we trying to do?
Um,

1712
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,360
you know,
in that evolves that,

1713
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,920
that evolves,
that evolves like,

1714
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:08,120
and is this over the long term going to
be a net positive for all humans,

1715
01:26:10,221 --> 01:26:11,240
all,
all humanity.

1716
01:26:11,241 --> 01:26:13,380
Like how do we balance the
considerations of,

1717
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:18,080
of how we serve everyone and like how do
we get down to something,

1718
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:21,200
how do we get down to a fundamental
answering the central answer?

1719
01:26:21,201 --> 01:26:25,610
And that to me is where the real truth
is when you can get to something

1720
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:27,770
foundational.
But I like,

1721
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:31,340
you know,
I like having conversations with as many

1722
01:26:31,341 --> 01:26:35,570
people from as many different fields as
possible and getting their perspective

1723
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:36,980
on it.
So I asked questions all the time.

1724
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:39,390
It's interesting the way you're phrasing
this too,

1725
01:26:39,391 --> 01:26:44,070
that you,
you are looking at this as a method to

1726
01:26:44,071 --> 01:26:45,700
save or to,
to,

1727
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,760
to help people,
to serve people.

1728
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:52,080
You're looking at this as a way that you
can benefit society.

1729
01:26:52,081 --> 01:26:54,090
The society can benefit from your
platform,

1730
01:26:54,091 --> 01:26:57,120
can benefit from this,
this ability to communicate,

1731
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:00,000
um,
you're not just looking at it as a tech

1732
01:27:00,001 --> 01:27:04,560
company that has to remain profitable
and that's one of the more interesting

1733
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:07,290
things about tech companies to me.
I mean,

1734
01:27:07,291 --> 01:27:10,980
there's been a lot of criticism maybe
justified in some ways the tech

1735
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:15,780
companies all lean left,
but what is interesting to me is that

1736
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:21,020
name another corporation that willingly
have its own choice,

1737
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:28,910
takes that into consideration that they
want to serve the world and surf culture

1738
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:33,540
in a beneficial way regardless of
profit.

1739
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:34,650
Yeah.
I mean,

1740
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,600
because you're not really selling
anything,

1741
01:27:36,930 --> 01:27:38,640
right?
You guys have a platform,

1742
01:27:38,641 --> 01:27:41,930
obviously it's financially viable,
but you're not,

1743
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,770
you're not selling things.

1744
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,770
Well,
I mean,

1745
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:45,820
we,
we,

1746
01:27:45,821 --> 01:27:48,370
we,
we do our models based off people's

1747
01:27:48,371 --> 01:27:49,204
attention.
Yeah.

1748
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:54,230
And they're paying us with our attention
and that's extremely valuable and

1749
01:27:55,091 --> 01:27:57,460
something that we need to really,
really honor.

1750
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:59,380
Um,
but I agree with you.

1751
01:27:59,381 --> 01:28:00,370
I mean like,
look at,

1752
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,840
look at Tesla,
you know,

1753
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:04,660
I just listened to,
uh,

1754
01:28:04,661 --> 01:28:05,680
um,
uh,

1755
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:07,420
the,
the recent earnings call on.

1756
01:28:07,421 --> 01:28:09,970
One of the things that you said was,
look,

1757
01:28:09,971 --> 01:28:11,640
there are two reasons,
uh,

1758
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:15,400
for Tesla,
number one is to advance,

1759
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,290
um,
uh,

1760
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:21,040
you know,
different sources of energy and more

1761
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:26,041
renewable sources of energy because it's
a fundamental and existential crisis

1762
01:28:26,651 --> 01:28:31,120
that's facing all humanity.
And number two is to advance autonomy

1763
01:28:31,121 --> 01:28:33,730
because it'll save lives and give people
time back.

1764
01:28:33,731 --> 01:28:38,731
And then you started talking about how
to make that possible and that's where

1765
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,430
our business comes in.
How do we,

1766
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:45,040
how do we make that possible?
And we,

1767
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:45,850
we have,
uh,

1768
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:47,380
we have a great business.
We,

1769
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:51,790
we need to improve all bunch of it,
but we,

1770
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:53,980
it,
it serves what we think our larger

1771
01:28:53,981 --> 01:28:55,750
purposes,
which is serving the public

1772
01:28:55,751 --> 01:28:58,750
conversation.
We want to see more global public

1773
01:28:58,751 --> 01:28:59,930
conversations.
We want to,

1774
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:04,380
we want technology to be used to make
the world feel a lot smaller,

1775
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:07,890
to help see what common problems we have
before us.

1776
01:29:07,891 --> 01:29:09,720
And ideally,
uh,

1777
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:12,180
you know,
how we can get people together to solve

1778
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:13,560
them faster and solve them better.

1779
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:17,050
You also seem to be embracing this
responsibility that you're,

1780
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:21,870
you're helping to evolve culture.
And this is part of the pro providing

1781
01:29:21,871 --> 01:29:24,450
this method of communication,
of communication,

1782
01:29:24,451 --> 01:29:28,080
rather it's helping to evolve culture.
And this is a,

1783
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:33,860
this is something that is really only
applicable to tech companies in some

1784
01:29:35,011 --> 01:29:39,750
strange way.
And it's weird that so many of them have

1785
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:43,410
share this.
Like I was personally a little weirded

1786
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:46,410
out when Google took out.
Don't be evil.

1787
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:49,450
Like that was a big part of their
operating model.

1788
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,730
Take that out.
Yes,

1789
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:52,410
yes.
Right.

1790
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,920
Make sure I don't want to get sued.
I'm pretty sure they removed that from.

1791
01:29:58,051 --> 01:29:59,100
What would the,
would you call that?

1792
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:02,970
Their,
their operational directive.

1793
01:30:02,971 --> 01:30:07,590
Like what is the code of conduct code of
conduct and it's not there anymore.

1794
01:30:07,591 --> 01:30:09,060
Right?
They're moved it.

1795
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,670
So the other article that says they
removed the clause and

1796
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:15,070
a weird thing to tell people not to be
evil,

1797
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,280
is it?
Where did it take it out once you've

1798
01:30:17,281 --> 01:30:21,090
already said it,
it's way weirder to say fuck it,

1799
01:30:21,091 --> 01:30:23,370
we were wrong.
It was another way of saying that they

1800
01:30:23,371 --> 01:30:25,190
changed it to do the right thing.
Yeah.

1801
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,270
Oh well,
what does that mean?

1802
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:31,260
The fuck does do the right thing.
Mean do the right thing so you can make

1803
01:30:31,261 --> 01:30:32,970
more money.
You know,

1804
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:33,631
like,
hey,

1805
01:30:33,631 --> 01:30:35,040
we're going to make money,
we'll do the right thing.

1806
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,210
It makes more money.

1807
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,060
You know what I mean?
It's,

1808
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:37,700
I mean,
that's,

1809
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:40,810
that's why like that's why this openness
is so critical.

1810
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,680
I mean,
that's why I like the public comment to

1811
01:30:42,681 --> 01:30:44,240
me,
the public conversation is so important

1812
01:30:44,241 --> 01:30:48,650
is we can talk about stuff like that and
there will be companies forming today

1813
01:30:48,651 --> 01:30:52,520
that look at um,
objectives and mandates like that and

1814
01:30:52,521 --> 01:30:57,260
base their whole culture around it.
And is that the right idea?

1815
01:30:57,950 --> 01:31:00,380
But if we're not talking about it,
we won't be able to answer that

1816
01:31:00,381 --> 01:31:00,940
question.

1817
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:04,810
What's also interesting,
because Google is so all encompassing,

1818
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,820
right?
You have gene male,

1819
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:12,030
you have enjoyed.
I mean that they are the number one

1820
01:31:12,401 --> 01:31:16,000
operating system for mobile phones in
the world on top of being a search

1821
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:18,190
engine.
There's so much involved in that

1822
01:31:18,191 --> 01:31:20,500
company.
And again,

1823
01:31:20,501 --> 01:31:25,501
like almost all tech companies,
they heavily lean left and they be.

1824
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:30,190
Because they had that don't be evil as a
part of their code of conduct.

1825
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:33,250
It seemed like something that was a good
idea to have,

1826
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,310
like,
and it sort of defined what I was

1827
01:31:36,311 --> 01:31:40,030
talking about that tech companies are
uniquely progressive.

1828
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:42,371
Yeah,
I mean,

1829
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:45,160
I dunno,
I dunno what makes it,

1830
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:47,770
um,
I think um,

1831
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:49,990
no matter what,
like we,

1832
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:56,130
the Internet allows for a very healthy
skepticism of nearly everything.

1833
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,240
Um,
I'm from,

1834
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,490
I'm from.
It's the show me state.

1835
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:01,910
Are you ready?
Yeah,

1836
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,000
I'm from Saint Louis,
Missouri.

1837
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:06,610
We're all skeptics.
My mom was a democrat.

1838
01:32:06,611 --> 01:32:11,020
My Dad was a republican.
My Dad listened to rush limbaugh and

1839
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:14,470
Hannity all the time.
I found myself somewhere in the middle,

1840
01:32:14,471 --> 01:32:19,471
but one of the things I appreciate it,
we had a ton of fights and arguments and

1841
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:23,050
yelling matches around the kitchen
table,

1842
01:32:23,051 --> 01:32:27,250
but like I appreciate the fact that we
could have them and I didn't,

1843
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:30,610
I felt safe to do so and I didn't feel
like,

1844
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:34,870
I mean obviously then my parents,
but they weren't judging me because of

1845
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,570
what I said.
And they didn't force you to be a

1846
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:38,620
republican or a democrat.

1847
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:39,820
It forced me to,
to,

1848
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,030
to think a particular way.
And I,

1849
01:32:42,031 --> 01:32:42,440
like,
I,

1850
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,540
I,
I think they were good,

1851
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:48,070
at least showing different perspectives
even in this,

1852
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:50,740
in this union that,
that they have.

1853
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,470
And I don't know,
it developed.

1854
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:58,120
It developed a skepticism in me that I,
that I think is,

1855
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:03,160
is healthy and I have a lot of
skepticism of companies like ours and

1856
01:33:05,081 --> 01:33:07,060
leaders like me.
I think that's right.

1857
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:09,190
I think that's right.
And people should.

1858
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:12,400
And we,
I mean I was,

1859
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:17,710
I was,
I was formed through a lot of the ideals

1860
01:33:18,821 --> 01:33:21,010
of the Internet.
I just fell in love with what it made

1861
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:23,370
possible and I,
I,

1862
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:28,710
I never ever want to run a foul of,
of those ideals and,

1863
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,310
and you know,
the,

1864
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,150
the,
the removal of barriers and boundaries

1865
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:36,550
and,
and the connection that we have because

1866
01:33:36,551 --> 01:33:38,860
of it.
And I,

1867
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:40,383
you know,
I,

1868
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:43,780
I,
I think often in reflect often about my

1869
01:33:43,781 --> 01:33:48,781
role and the centralization of my role
in our company and I,

1870
01:33:49,731 --> 01:33:52,390
I wanna,
I wanna figure out and help figure out

1871
01:33:52,391 --> 01:33:56,770
like how we can continue to add massive
value and,

1872
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:02,170
and be an amazing business which is,
is us and will always be us.

1873
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:07,170
But at the same time,
be a participant participatory force in

1874
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:13,960
this greater good that the Internet has
really started and it's not,

1875
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:18,880
it's not led by any one individual or
anyone company and that's the beauty of

1876
01:34:18,881 --> 01:34:21,910
it and I want to,
I want to make sure that we find our

1877
01:34:21,911 --> 01:34:25,030
place in that and we can also contribute
massively to.

1878
01:34:25,031 --> 01:34:27,700
And then I think we can,
it's just gonna take a lot of work and a

1879
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:30,370
lot of introspection and a lot of
experimentation,

1880
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,980
a lot of making mistakes and failures
too.

1881
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:34,530
Well,

1882
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:38,000
it's very encouraging that you have that
attitude because a,

1883
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:42,140
you know,
a lot of people I think in a similar

1884
01:34:42,141 --> 01:34:44,540
situation would try to control the
narrative.

1885
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:49,910
They would try to reinforce their own
particular perspective on things and try

1886
01:34:49,911 --> 01:34:52,160
to get other people to adopt it or try
to push it.

1887
01:34:52,670 --> 01:34:55,610
And I think it is,
it's very important to just have this

1888
01:34:55,611 --> 01:34:58,280
open discussion and,
and I think it's very important

1889
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,970
to review your own thoughts and ideas
and one of the best ways to do so.

1890
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,010
Put us through the.
Yeah,

1891
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:04,160
put it out there,
put it out there.

1892
01:35:04,161 --> 01:35:06,230
And have other people review,
peer review is a,

1893
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:11,270
is a great process and that's the way
this podcast has evolved more than

1894
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:14,210
probably anything.
That's the thing.

1895
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:14,920
I mean you,
you,

1896
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:16,940
you did this because you want to learn
from people and,

1897
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:19,590
and the,
the platform that you,

1898
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:24,020
you've created millions get to learn
from it as well and that's just so

1899
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:27,560
amazing like I learned from your podcast
all the time and

1900
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:34,010
that's what technology makes possible.
But with that power also comes

1901
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:38,330
ramifications and if we're not talking
about the ramifications and like at

1902
01:35:38,331 --> 01:35:40,490
least being open about what we know and
what we don't know.

1903
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:45,410
And I think we're,
I think we state and post a lot more of

1904
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:49,220
what we know rather than what we don't
know when that is so interesting.

1905
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:51,170
Why don't you guys steal?
Don't be evil.

1906
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,260
Put that in your own shit.
Fuck.

1907
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:55,970
You don't know if that's going to help
anything.

1908
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:59,540
Then what is that telling our employees
that do don't leave.

1909
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:01,790
It's real simple.
There'll be a dick.

1910
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,940
Yeah.
I mean like how do,

1911
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:05,120
how do we,
how do we get deeper?

1912
01:36:05,121 --> 01:36:10,121
And just like seeing more conversation
around what is quote unquote eval,

1913
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:15,140
have you guys considered expanding your
influence in other venues?

1914
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:16,120
I'm like,
you know,

1915
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:19,010
Google started off as a search engine
now it's fucking everything.

1916
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:21,980
Have you guys considered doing something
similar?

1917
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:24,050
I think we probably did too much of that
early on.

1918
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:28,040
And that's what led to a bunch of issues
from a,

1919
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,450
from a corporate standpoint.
We're just trying to do too much,

1920
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:33,290
too many times.
Uh,

1921
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:34,970
I dunno,
we were trying to be everything to

1922
01:36:34,971 --> 01:36:36,620
everyone and like,
you know,

1923
01:36:36,621 --> 01:36:37,640
we,
we had a,

1924
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:40,480
uh,
a video thing and we had um,

1925
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:45,520
we're looking at um,
gaming stuff and messaging and it lost

1926
01:36:46,611 --> 01:36:48,320
focus of what we are good at.

1927
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,250
What we're good at is conversation and
what we're good at is as public

1928
01:36:52,251 --> 01:36:54,380
conversation.
So we now have,

1929
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:57,980
as a company,
we have just such an amazing focus on

1930
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,860
what that means and how that evolves.
And there's just,

1931
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,990
there's some really cool things that we
can do.

1932
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:04,040
They're like,
we have this,

1933
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:07,400
we have this app called periscope.
And one of the things that we're

1934
01:37:07,401 --> 01:37:11,660
discovering is like a lot of people are
using it to podcast,

1935
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:16,280
a lot of people are using it to share
their thoughts and these people come in

1936
01:37:16,281 --> 01:37:20,330
and chat and have a conversation.
And uh,

1937
01:37:20,331 --> 01:37:24,200
one of the things we did recently is we
allowed the audio to play in the

1938
01:37:24,201 --> 01:37:25,760
background.
It's super simple,

1939
01:37:25,761 --> 01:37:30,320
but what we found was that people didn't
necessarily want to watch the video of

1940
01:37:30,321 --> 01:37:32,420
people talking.
They just want to hear what they're

1941
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:35,720
saying.
And that just opened the door for more

1942
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:37,010
types of use cases.

1943
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:42,010
And there's some really exciting things
coming out with periscope that I think

1944
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:47,470
add a new dimension to what conversation
looks like and how it is experienced and

1945
01:37:49,191 --> 01:37:50,880
how it evolves.
And um,

1946
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:54,320
those are the things I get really
excited about is like how,

1947
01:37:54,321 --> 01:37:58,590
how can we conversation better and,
and how,

1948
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,453
uh,
you know,

1949
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:00,480
how,
how do we,

1950
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:05,520
how do we make it feel more live?
How do we make it feel more,

1951
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:07,870
um,
electric and a,

1952
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:10,860
how do we bring new,
um,

1953
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:16,250
new technology into it that,
that just opens the door for an entirely

1954
01:38:16,981 --> 01:38:20,030
new way of talking.
And,

1955
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:24,510
and that's the thing that I think has
been most educational to me about

1956
01:38:24,511 --> 01:38:25,670
twitter as we,
you know,

1957
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:26,700
as we,
as we talked about,

1958
01:38:26,701 --> 01:38:31,701
we started with this idea of sharing
what was happening around you and then

1959
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:36,990
people told us what they wanted to
wanted it to be and it became this

1960
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:38,280
conversational medium.

1961
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:42,450
It became this interest networked and it
became a,

1962
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,860
it became a thing that was entirely new
and it,

1963
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,050
you know,
we observed it and uh,

1964
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,510
we learned more and more of what it
wanted to be in.

1965
01:38:51,511 --> 01:38:54,900
We as we get deeper and deeper that
we're going to be surprised by some of

1966
01:38:54,901 --> 01:38:57,690
the technologies that we thought would
be used in this way,

1967
01:38:57,691 --> 01:39:02,190
but it turns out that the,
the massive use case and the resonant

1968
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:06,240
use case in the fundamental use case is
going to be created right before our

1969
01:39:06,241 --> 01:39:08,160
eyes by the people using it.
Now,

1970
01:39:08,161 --> 01:39:11,790
did you guys acquire periscope?
What was required postcode and what was

1971
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:13,320
the thought process when you requiring
it?

1972
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:14,760
Um,
we,

1973
01:39:14,761 --> 01:39:16,500
uh,
we liked the live nature of it.

1974
01:39:16,501 --> 01:39:18,360
We liked the broadcast,
uh,

1975
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:20,880
aspects,
whitey black and why keep it as

1976
01:39:20,881 --> 01:39:23,460
periscope?
Why not have it be like twitter live?

1977
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:26,520
There's a,
there's a specific community on,

1978
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:27,691
on,
uh,

1979
01:39:27,691 --> 01:39:31,020
on periscope.
And I think it's interesting from an

1980
01:39:31,021 --> 01:39:34,920
experimentation standpoint,
we can play with ideas there.

1981
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:38,440
It's a small tigress I think uses it
better than anybody he gets.

1982
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:39,510
He's,
he's,

1983
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:43,170
he's really good at it and he's,
he's one that I think has figured out,

1984
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:45,400
um,
you know,

1985
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:47,370
just the NAC behind it,
you know,

1986
01:39:47,371 --> 01:39:49,950
he,
he starts every one of them with,

1987
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,790
uh,
with this,

1988
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,180
uh,
simultaneous sip of coffee.

1989
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:58,800
So he gets his listeners and his viewers
engaged right away.

1990
01:39:58,801 --> 01:40:01,370
And then he just goes on and then every
now and then he'll,

1991
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:02,810
you know,
look at the comments and,

1992
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:06,130
and riff off of them.
So people build up to like,

1993
01:40:06,131 --> 01:40:08,310
he,
he'll announce that he's going on and

1994
01:40:08,311 --> 01:40:10,440
then wait a little while and say hello
to some people.

1995
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:12,390
Then once a bunch of people are in the
room,

1996
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:13,620
then he starts talking.

1997
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:14,141
Yeah,
and I,

1998
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:15,790
I just,
I find A.

1999
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:19,470
I find that so interesting because that
is the future of conversation.

2000
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:22,110
It's looking at the patterns,
it's looking at what people are trying

2001
01:40:22,111 --> 01:40:25,770
to do with a thing and then you build
technology around it and that becomes.

2002
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:28,860
That becomes the next big thing and we
just have to.

2003
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:34,190
We have to hone our power of observation
in our power of like connecting the dots

2004
01:40:34,211 --> 01:40:36,030
and looking at all the patterns and what
people are.

2005
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:38,280
It's what's the question behind the
question?

2006
01:40:38,281 --> 01:40:39,960
What's,
what's the statement behind the

2007
01:40:39,961 --> 01:40:43,530
statement that they're making and if we
can get good at understanding some of

2008
01:40:43,531 --> 01:40:46,050
those fundamental central things,
then we've reached,

2009
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,050
we've,
we've at least created the probability

2010
01:40:49,051 --> 01:40:52,800
that most people in the world will find
it useful and find valuable.

2011
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,010
Joey Diaz

2012
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,610
is the other person that uses periscope
better than anybody alive,

2013
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:00,070
but he just gets it.
He just gets baked.

2014
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:03,380
That just gives you a morning.
He call it morning bond.

2015
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:04,870
Morning joint.
The morning joint.

2016
01:41:04,930 --> 01:41:05,441
Yeah.
He'll,

2017
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:10,240
he'll smoke a joint or smoke a bowl in
the morning and then just sort of let

2018
01:41:10,241 --> 01:41:11,540
everybody know,
do you in.

2019
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:12,374
Sometimes mine

2020
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:14,750
doing something in sync with one,
with,

2021
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:16,210
with more people's interesting.
Like,

2022
01:41:16,211 --> 01:41:17,270
uh,
we've um,

2023
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:23,080
we've had some folks who are interested
in doing meditations through periscope.

2024
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:24,440
Oh,
that's a great idea.

2025
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:25,550
You can't.
I mean if you,

2026
01:41:25,551 --> 01:41:26,750
if you looked at,
at the surface level,

2027
01:41:26,751 --> 01:41:29,870
I can't imagine anything more boring
than like watching someone meditate,

2028
01:41:29,871 --> 01:41:32,840
but if you're actually meditating with
them,

2029
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:36,710
there's something powerful about it and
like what can we do to improve that

2030
01:41:36,711 --> 01:41:37,510
experience?

2031
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:40,480
What about people using it for group
workouts?

2032
01:41:40,481 --> 01:41:41,350
Is anyone doing that?

2033
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:44,000
I'm sure it's happened and I haven't
seen it personally,

2034
01:41:44,001 --> 01:41:46,280
but I'm sure it's happening.
How much more people do you have on

2035
01:41:46,281 --> 01:41:47,990
twitter than periscope?
A lot.

2036
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:49,520
A lot.
A lot.

2037
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:53,090
It's a,
it's one of those things that I

2038
01:41:53,091 --> 01:41:56,960
personally just have a lot of conviction
around and I have a lot of belief in the

2039
01:41:56,961 --> 01:42:00,290
format in.
I know every now and then we don't have

2040
01:42:00,291 --> 01:42:04,670
instant hits.
It just requires a lot of patients and

2041
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:07,460
we need to really learn what it wants to
be in the.

2042
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:12,650
Sometimes that takes time and you know,
I think oftentimes I've certainly done

2043
01:42:12,651 --> 01:42:13,940
this.
We,

2044
01:42:13,941 --> 01:42:14,920
uh,
you know,

2045
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:17,090
we shut down,
we shut down things a little bit too

2046
01:42:17,091 --> 01:42:21,770
early and we did this at square.
Like we had this amazing technology and

2047
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:26,800
app I love cold a square wallet and it
allowed you to um,

2048
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:29,960
you know,
you link your credit card and you have

2049
01:42:29,961 --> 01:42:34,460
all these merchants around you here in
La and you could walk up to a coffee

2050
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:38,060
merchant and as you walked up,
your name would pop up on the register.

2051
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:39,670
So you could say like,
I want a Cappuccino,

2052
01:42:39,710 --> 01:42:42,860
put it on Jack and it just automatically
charge your card.

2053
01:42:42,861 --> 01:42:45,620
And they would only happen if you were
with him like two feet.

2054
01:42:45,621 --> 01:42:47,870
We're using Bluetooth and geolocation
would not.

2055
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,490
But we,
uh,

2056
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,540
we,
we had it for about three years and it,

2057
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:54,800
it,
it just didn't take off and we shut it

2058
01:42:54,801 --> 01:42:57,350
down.
And I kinda regret doing that.

2059
01:42:57,351 --> 01:43:01,970
But it also paved the way for another
thing that I didn't want to give up on.

2060
01:43:01,971 --> 01:43:04,280
And that was,
that was the cash app,

2061
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:07,280
like for four years.
Uh,

2062
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:10,640
it was just a slog,
like a lot of people in the company

2063
01:43:10,641 --> 01:43:14,000
wanted to shut down the thing.
They saw it as something that wasn't

2064
01:43:14,001 --> 01:43:15,930
successful.
And you know,

2065
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:18,920
recently the team reached number one in
the,

2066
01:43:18,921 --> 01:43:21,460
in the APP store in the United States.
Like we,

2067
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:23,240
we,
we were all,

2068
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,240
we were against all these incumbents
like Venmo and paypal and,

2069
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:30,140
and uh,
it finally clicked and it's just because

2070
01:43:30,141 --> 01:43:32,720
we had the patients and the conviction
render our belief.

2071
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:34,800
Yeah,
it's a great app too.

2072
01:43:34,801 --> 01:43:38,100
And the ethics behind it are really
fantastic too.

2073
01:43:38,101 --> 01:43:41,910
We're really thankful for the cash app,
especially my friend Justin wren,

2074
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:45,150
and it's fight for the forgotten charity
that every time you use the code word

2075
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:47,160
Joe Rogan all one word,
it all goes.

2076
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:51,860
Where matched $5 goes to,
to that they've built two to the pygmies

2077
01:43:51,861 --> 01:43:54,350
in the Congo and they've raised
thousands of dollars in building more

2078
01:43:54,351 --> 01:43:55,640
wells right now.
It's really,

2079
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:56,474
really cool.
Yeah,

2080
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:57,890
we're really,
really happy about that.

2081
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,480
Yeah.
Yeah,

2082
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,280
I love it.
I think it's um,

2083
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:03,410
it's a great way to save money too.
I mean when you can save 10 percent at

2084
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:05,990
whole foods,
I mean that's real.

2085
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:08,790
Well,
if the other thing is like to the

2086
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:13,791
population that we serve typically are
underserved by banks or unbanked

2087
01:44:14,251 --> 01:44:16,950
entirely.
We are their bank account,

2088
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:21,510
but more importantly they don't have
access to things like rewards.

2089
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,760
You don't get rewards on a typical debit
card or credit card.

2090
01:44:24,761 --> 01:44:28,620
So like just you know,
going to your favorite place and getting

2091
01:44:28,621 --> 01:44:30,820
an instant 10 percent off or whatever it
is,

2092
01:44:30,821 --> 01:44:35,250
is out of reach for most people because
the financial institutions don't enable

2093
01:44:35,251 --> 01:44:37,320
that and they won't even enable them to
get in the door,

2094
01:44:37,321 --> 01:44:38,340
in the front,
in the first place.

2095
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:39,230
Well,
if people are listening,

2096
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:40,870
is this on youtube,
you don't know what the fuck we're

2097
01:44:40,871 --> 01:44:43,300
talking about.
The cash APP has a thing called a cash

2098
01:44:43,301 --> 01:44:46,420
card or a debit card that you get with
it and there's a thing called boosts and

2099
01:44:46,421 --> 01:44:49,300
with boosts,
all you do is pick a boost in the APP

2100
01:44:49,301 --> 01:44:53,560
and then use your cash card as a debit
card and you get these automatic

2101
01:44:53,561 --> 01:44:55,540
discounts and they're real discounts.
Yep.

2102
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:59,290
And interest for folks with bad credit.
There's no credit check.

2103
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:03,580
You can direct deposit your paycheck
right into the app and the fact that you

2104
01:45:03,581 --> 01:45:08,170
guys do do things like support fight for
the forgotten and you're supporting UFC

2105
01:45:08,171 --> 01:45:10,990
fighter ray borg son.
He's got some serious medical bills.

2106
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:11,853
No,
it's really,

2107
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:12,960
really cool.
Yeah.

2108
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:13,601
Yeah.
I'm really.

2109
01:45:13,601 --> 01:45:15,070
I'm really proud of that.
I'm really proud of the team.

2110
01:45:15,071 --> 01:45:16,240
It's A.
It's a very small team,

2111
01:45:16,241 --> 01:45:17,260
but they're doing some big things

2112
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:19,040
well.
I hear a lot of good things about it

2113
01:45:19,041 --> 01:45:19,461
too.
I've,

2114
01:45:19,461 --> 01:45:20,930
I've,
I've run into people on the street that

2115
01:45:20,931 --> 01:45:22,640
tells me they use it in the very happy
about it,

2116
01:45:22,641 --> 01:45:24,590
so it's nice to see,
again,

2117
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,800
a,
an emerging technology that's profitable

2118
01:45:27,801 --> 01:45:31,640
but yet also has a really good at it.
Really good set of ethics.

2119
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:32,563
Yeah.
Yeah.

2120
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:35,090
Do you have,
don't be evil in cash.

2121
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:37,610
Maybe we should.
Maybe we should take it.

2122
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:39,300
So when,
uh,

2123
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,210
one of our,
one of our like equivalent operating

2124
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:47,211
principles within cash and square is
like under like how do we understand

2125
01:45:47,611 --> 01:45:50,160
someone's struggle?
Like how do we understand like how do we

2126
01:45:50,161 --> 01:45:53,070
have the empathy for what they're
struggling with and like when it comes

2127
01:45:53,071 --> 01:45:54,570
to finance,
they're struggling with a lot.

2128
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:56,850
Yeah.
Typically they're struggling with a ton.

2129
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:58,100
What was the,

2130
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:59,540
the thought process with.
I mean,

2131
01:45:59,541 --> 01:46:02,270
one of the things that's kind of cool
about the cash app is that you can buy

2132
01:46:02,271 --> 01:46:04,610
and sell bitcoin with it.
Are you going,

2133
01:46:04,611 --> 01:46:08,120
are you guys going to consider other
forms of crypto currency as well?

2134
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,580
Not right now.
I,

2135
01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:13,050
so back to the Internet.
I believe the Internet will have a

2136
01:46:13,051 --> 01:46:15,900
native currency really.
They don't have a native currency and I

2137
01:46:15,901 --> 01:46:19,770
don't know if it's bitcoin and I think
it will because just given all the tests

2138
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:22,680
it's been through and the principles
behind it,

2139
01:46:22,681 --> 01:46:25,510
how it was created and um,
you know,

2140
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:27,120
it's,
it was something that was born on the

2141
01:46:27,121 --> 01:46:31,260
Internet that was developed on the
Internet that it was tested on it.

2142
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:35,780
It is of the Internet and the reason we,
um,

2143
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:39,630
you know,
we enabled the purchasing of bitcoin

2144
01:46:39,631 --> 01:46:43,020
within,
within the cash APP is one we want to

2145
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:45,840
learn about the technology and we wanted
to put ourselves out there and take some

2146
01:46:45,841 --> 01:46:48,090
risks.
Were the first publicly traded company

2147
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:52,620
to actually it as a service where the
first publicly traded company to talk to

2148
01:46:52,621 --> 01:46:55,800
the sec about the coin in what that,
what that means.

2149
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:59,160
And it made us uncomfortable.
We had to,

2150
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:02,550
we had to like really understand what
was going on and,

2151
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:07,080
and that was critical and important.
And then the second thing is that we,

2152
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:08,370
you know,
we would,

2153
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:12,160
we would love to see something become a
global currency.

2154
01:47:12,161 --> 01:47:14,490
It did,
it enables more access.

2155
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:16,320
It,
it allows us to serve more people.

2156
01:47:16,321 --> 01:47:18,450
It allows us to move much faster around
the world.

2157
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:20,790
And um,
we,

2158
01:47:20,791 --> 01:47:21,624
uh,
we,

2159
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:26,490
we thought we were going to start with
how you can use it transactionally,

2160
01:47:26,491 --> 01:47:31,491
but we noticed that people were treating
it more like an asset,

2161
01:47:31,921 --> 01:47:33,600
like a,
like a virtual gold,

2162
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:35,530
and we wanted to,
um,

2163
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:40,800
we want to just to make that easy,
like I'm just the simplest way to buy

2164
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:45,060
and sell bitcoin.
But we also knew that it had to come

2165
01:47:45,061 --> 01:47:48,240
with a lot of education,
had to come with constraint because,

2166
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,500
you know,
two years ago people did some really

2167
01:47:52,501 --> 01:47:54,020
unhealthy things about,
you know,

2168
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:55,040
purchasing bitcoin.

2169
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:57,610
They maxed out their credit cards and
um,

2170
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:00,320
put all their life savings into bitcoin.
So we,

2171
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:04,140
we developed some severity,
simple restrictions and constraints like

2172
01:48:04,141 --> 01:48:06,420
you can,
you can't buy bitcoin on the cash app

2173
01:48:06,421 --> 01:48:08,040
with a credit card.
You have to,

2174
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:09,990
it has to be the money you actually have
in it.

2175
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,720
And we look for day trading,
which we,

2176
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:15,480
uh,
we discourage and shut down like that.

2177
01:48:15,481 --> 01:48:18,930
That's not what we're trying to build.
That's not what we're trying to optimize

2178
01:48:18,931 --> 01:48:22,080
for.
We made a children's book explaining

2179
01:48:22,081 --> 01:48:26,950
what Bitcoin is and where it came from
and how people use it and where it might

2180
01:48:26,951 --> 01:48:29,850
be going.
So we really tried to take on the role

2181
01:48:29,851 --> 01:48:32,220
of education and,
and,

2182
01:48:32,221 --> 01:48:37,221
and to have some like very simple
healthy constraints that allowed to be

2183
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:41,310
allowed people to consider what their
actions are in the space.

2184
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,180
Now when you have something like the
cash app,

2185
01:48:43,181 --> 01:48:46,600
which is a,
it's very much a disruptive technology

2186
01:48:46,601 --> 01:48:51,570
in terms of like decentralization of,
of banks and,

2187
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:54,190
and,
and currency and you know,

2188
01:48:54,191 --> 01:48:58,390
to have it where everything is going
right at your direct depositing a

2189
01:48:58,391 --> 01:49:00,250
paycheck right in the app if you so
choose.

2190
01:49:00,251 --> 01:49:04,080
And then you could also buy bitcoin,
which is another disruptive technology

2191
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:09,100
mean that this is another step towards
this sort of new way of doing things.

2192
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:15,310
No.
And is there pushback from,

2193
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:17,380
from any companies or is there.

2194
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:18,471
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2195
01:49:18,471 --> 01:49:22,220
I mean like you just look at some of the
major banks and their consideration

2196
01:49:22,221 --> 01:49:25,490
around bitcoin.
They all love blockchain because of the

2197
01:49:25,491 --> 01:49:29,300
efficiencies that can create for their
business and potentially new business

2198
01:49:29,301 --> 01:49:29,931
lines.
But,

2199
01:49:29,931 --> 01:49:30,860
um,
you know,

2200
01:49:30,861 --> 01:49:33,620
I think there is a explain blockchain to
people for people who don't know what

2201
01:49:33,621 --> 01:49:36,410
we're talking about.
Blockchain is a distributed ledger and

2202
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:38,180
what that means is that,
um,

2203
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:40,790
it's basically a distributed database
where,

2204
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:41,490
you know,
the,

2205
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:46,490
the source of truth can be verified at
any point around the network and you

2206
01:49:46,671 --> 01:49:47,830
can,
you know,

2207
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:48,460
um,
this,

2208
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:53,460
this annotation around how content or
how around money like traveled.

2209
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,630
Um,
so you don't have to go to an

2210
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:57,100
institution.
So the records,

2211
01:49:57,101 --> 01:49:58,840
yeah,
there's no centralized check,

2212
01:49:58,841 --> 01:50:00,730
there's no centralized control over it.
Um,

2213
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:02,880
and I think that is a threatening.
It's,

2214
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:04,420
it's,
it's certainly threatening,

2215
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:08,470
um,
to certain services behind banks and

2216
01:50:08,471 --> 01:50:09,760
financial institutions.

2217
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,400
It's threatening to some governments as
well.

2218
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:14,270
Um,
so I,

2219
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:16,810
I just look at this and like how do we
embrace this technology,

2220
01:50:16,811 --> 01:50:20,680
not react to it in a more from a threat
standpoint,

2221
01:50:20,681 --> 01:50:25,540
but like what does it enable us to do
and where does our value shift?

2222
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,930
And that's what we should be talking
about right now is like how our value

2223
01:50:28,931 --> 01:50:32,110
shifts.
And there's always really strong answers

2224
01:50:32,111 --> 01:50:33,850
to that question.
But if you're not willing to ask the

2225
01:50:33,851 --> 01:50:36,700
question the first place,
you will become irrelevant because

2226
01:50:36,701 --> 01:50:41,350
technology will just continue to march
on and make you irrelevant and it's the

2227
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:42,880
people that like are,
are,

2228
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:44,980
you know,
growing up with this technology are born

2229
01:50:44,981 --> 01:50:49,330
with the technology only knowing that
technology or are asking the tough

2230
01:50:49,331 --> 01:50:53,110
questions of ourselves that are going to
be super disruptive to their business

2231
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:55,540
and they're,
they're thinking about right now and

2232
01:50:55,541 --> 01:50:57,820
they're and they're taking actions and
you know,

2233
01:50:57,821 --> 01:50:59,530
we're doing,
we're doing that at square and we're

2234
01:50:59,531 --> 01:51:03,790
doing that at twitter and like that to
me represents longevity.

2235
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:07,520
That represents our ability to,
to thrive and we,

2236
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:10,270
we got to push ourselves going to make
ourselves uncomfortable and we got to

2237
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:15,271
disrupt what we held sacred and what we
think is success at it because otherwise

2238
01:51:17,051 --> 01:51:18,760
it's not going to be bigger than what we
have today.

2239
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:19,960
Yeah.
I couldn't agree more.

2240
01:51:19,961 --> 01:51:24,961
And I think that cryptocurrency to me
represents one of the more interesting

2241
01:51:25,001 --> 01:51:29,440
discussions on the Internet.
What is money and why are we agreeing

2242
01:51:29,441 --> 01:51:32,470
that it's these pieces of paper that the
Federal Reserve prints out.

2243
01:51:32,471 --> 01:51:33,060
Totally.
It's,

2244
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:37,450
it's a fascinating time in technology
because like that,

2245
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:41,050
that to me was one of the,
one of the last big,

2246
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:44,370
um,
centralized natch,

2247
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:49,600
a nationalized instruments is his
currency is money and when you think

2248
01:51:50,111 --> 01:51:52,990
about the internet as a,
as a,

2249
01:51:52,991 --> 01:51:55,240
as a country,
as a market,

2250
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:59,200
as a nation,
it's going to have its own currency and,

2251
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:01,270
but what's interesting about the
internet as a nation,

2252
01:52:01,271 --> 01:52:02,110
it's the whole world.

2253
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:06,400
It is the whole world.
So the world gets one currency,

2254
01:52:06,401 --> 01:52:09,360
it gets,
it's one thing to communicate in and

2255
01:52:09,361 --> 01:52:10,960
that,
to me it's just so freeing and so

2256
01:52:10,961 --> 01:52:12,130
exciting.
Yeah,

2257
01:52:12,170 --> 01:52:14,800
I,
I'm very excited by it and I'm also very

2258
01:52:14,801 --> 01:52:17,530
excited that the fact that it's only
been around for such a short period of

2259
01:52:17,531 --> 01:52:18,101
time,
but yeah,

2260
01:52:18,101 --> 01:52:21,220
10 years and it's become a part of the
global conversation,

2261
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:24,220
good brand.
I also think that it's going to open up

2262
01:52:24,221 --> 01:52:28,820
the door to potential universal
languages and I think this is,

2263
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:30,100
this is.
Yeah.

2264
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:31,740
Yeah.
That excites me a lot about twitter as

2265
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:36,540
like how do we like it if we want to get
the world into a conversation into a,

2266
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:40,000
not a single conversation,
but at least being able to see that

2267
01:52:40,001 --> 01:52:42,930
global conversation,
like we gotta work on technologies that

2268
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:44,940
like instantly translate.
Yeah,

2269
01:52:44,941 --> 01:52:48,760
we got to work on technologies that I
can speak as I'm speaking right now in,

2270
01:52:48,761 --> 01:52:52,070
in real time.
People are hearing it in their context

2271
01:52:52,071 --> 01:52:55,370
and their language and their dialect.
That is amazing.

2272
01:52:55,371 --> 01:52:58,730
That is so exciting.
And like just how that evolves.

2273
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:00,520
Um,
and uh,

2274
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,800
how it,
how it impacts not just communication

2275
01:53:03,801 --> 01:53:04,820
like this,
but music.

2276
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:05,930
Uh,
and just like,

2277
01:53:05,931 --> 01:53:08,610
you know,
how hip hop and rap and you know,

2278
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:10,370
just,
it just,

2279
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:11,190
it,
it's,

2280
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:13,850
it's amazing to think about where that,
where that can go and where that can

2281
01:53:13,851 --> 01:53:14,990
take us.
Yeah.

2282
01:53:14,991 --> 01:53:15,600
And I think

2283
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:19,530
you and I are extremely fortunate to be
alive right now during this time because

2284
01:53:19,531 --> 01:53:23,550
I think it's one of the strangest and
most unique times in human history.

2285
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:25,440
Totally.
I don't think there's ever been a time

2286
01:53:25,441 --> 01:53:27,600
where things have changed so radically
so quickly.

2287
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:28,690
Totally.
Yeah.

2288
01:53:28,691 --> 01:53:29,890
And I,
I feel,

2289
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:30,491
you know,
we,

2290
01:53:30,491 --> 01:53:32,520
um,
we're,

2291
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:33,493
we're,
we're just,

2292
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,680
we're,
we're able through technologies like

2293
01:53:35,681 --> 01:53:40,681
twitter to at least see and acknowledge
some of the issues that we're still

2294
01:53:41,471 --> 01:53:46,330
facing and we're probably in the dark
before and I think that's so critical to

2295
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:52,680
making any sort of improvements for,
for making any sort of evolution and a

2296
01:53:54,190 --> 01:53:56,080
and for making it better for everyone on
the planet.

2297
01:53:56,081 --> 01:53:57,600
And I,
you know,

2298
01:53:58,330 --> 01:53:59,950
as,
as uncomfortable as,

2299
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:03,490
as you know,
sometimes twitter makes people feel,

2300
01:54:03,491 --> 01:54:06,940
I think it is necessary to,
to see those things and have

2301
01:54:06,941 --> 01:54:10,720
conversations about them so that we can
understand how we might move forward and

2302
01:54:10,721 --> 01:54:15,040
how we might.
I'm really good at the biggest problems

2303
01:54:15,041 --> 01:54:18,910
facing us all and you know,
there's some huge ones,

2304
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:22,360
some huge ones right now that if we
don't have,

2305
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:27,930
if we don't talk about it,
like it will drive us to extinction and

2306
01:54:28,691 --> 01:54:33,691
like it will threaten our ability to,
to be a planet to live on this planet.

2307
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:37,303
I agree.

2308
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:39,010
Thank you.
Thanks for everything,

2309
01:54:39,011 --> 01:54:40,060
man.
Thanks for being here.

2310
01:54:40,061 --> 01:54:42,370
Thanks for doing what you're doing.
Thanks for having the attitude that you

2311
01:54:42,371 --> 01:54:42,971
have.
I really,

2312
01:54:42,971 --> 01:54:43,810
really appreciate it.
Thank you.

2313
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,330
My pleasure.
Bye everybody.

2314
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,480
Thank you.
