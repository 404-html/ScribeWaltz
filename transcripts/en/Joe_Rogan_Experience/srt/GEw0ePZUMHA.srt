1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,080
All right,
here we go.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,033
Three,

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,650
boom.
And we're live.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,520
How are you sir?
I'm fine.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,890
Pretty good.
Thank you for doing this.

6
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,360
I appreciate it.
That's fine.

7
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:15,490
My pleasure.
Who roped you into this?

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:16,840
Well,
I think,

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,800
I suppose James Tag Probably.
I,

10
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:22,840
uh,
I'm a big fan of your work.

11
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,703
I've read much of your work.
I've seen many of your interviews and 

12
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:27,940
videos online.
And,

13
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:28,774
uh,
one of the things that I really wanted 

14
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:30,214
to talk to you about it I find quite 
interesting is consciousness and your 

15
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:38,740
belief that consciousness is not simply 
calculation,

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,310
but that there's something more to it 
and what,

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,990
what you think this more could possibly 
be from a scientific perspective,

18
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:50,110
which is unusual because a lot of people
have some theories about consciousness,

19
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:52,840
but they're usually crazy people like 
myself.

20
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,300
Well,
I mean,

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,910
we're all conscious and so we may have 
theories about it.

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,013
Yeah.
But now the ideas came by a somewhat 

23
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,310
roundabout route.

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,780
Uh,
I,

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,400
I went to Cambridge do graduate work.
It was mathematics.

26
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,310
I was working on pure mathematical 
subjects,

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,420
Algebra,
geometry.

28
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,130
But I thought,
you know,

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,993
we've got three years.
I'll spend some of the time going to 

30
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:22,810
other talks that might be interesting.
So I went to three talks particularly,

31
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:27,811
which had a big influence on me.
One was a talk by Herman Bondi with uh,

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,700
um,
general relativity cosmology,

33
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,760
wonderful tool with very sort of 
animated presentation,

34
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,320
the Ad.
And then there was a talk by Paul Dirac,

35
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:39,154
one of the founders of quantum mechanics
and histalk what he's completely 

36
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,850
wonderful talk to wonderful lectures as 
well,

37
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:49,720
but they're completely different style.
He was very quiet and precise in what he

38
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:51,130
said and everything.
Anyway,

39
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:51,964
in the very first lecture he was talking
about the superposition principle in 

40
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:56,344
quantum mechanics.
So if you have a particle and it could 

41
00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:01,570
be in one spot or it could be in another
spot,

42
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,900
then you have all sorts of states where 
it can be in both places at once.

43
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,980
That's sort of strange,
but you've got to get used to that idea.

44
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,383
And he illustrated with his speech at 
piece of chalk and I think he broke it 

45
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:16,630
into two illustrates.
It could be in one spot or in the other.

46
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,170
And my mind sort of wanders at that 
point.

47
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:23,080
I don't know what I was thinking about,
but I wasn't concentrating.

48
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,650
And about a few minutes later he'd 
finished,

49
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,543
his description is explanation and I had
some vague memory of something about 

50
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,330
energy,
but I didn't understand what he said.

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,900
And I've been totally mystified by this 
ever since.

52
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,790
So I suppose if I had heard what he 
said,

53
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,624
he would have said something to calm me 
down and I sort of accepted in one way 

54
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:45,460
or another.
But as it was,

55
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,713
it seemed to me this was a major issue.
How on earth do you have things that 

56
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,780
don't behave according to watch porn?

57
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,440
The mechanic says like cricket balls and
baseballs and things like that.

58
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,390
Anyway,
that's two of the talks.

59
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,733
The course was a course by a man called 
steen who talked on mathematical logic 

60
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,573
and he explained things like girdle's 
theorem and touring machines during 

61
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:15,631
machines being their mathematical notion
upon which modern computers are based or

62
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,260
computers basically.
And uh,

63
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
uh,
the thing about girdles there and you 

64
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,254
see,
I'd heard,

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,440
I used to have a colleague when I was 
undergraduate in first of all,

66
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,160
who was,
who became a scientist later on.

67
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,220
And we talked about,
uh,

68
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,003
logic and you know,
how you could make these kind of 

69
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,520
mathematical systems,
which worked out logic.

70
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,790
And I'd heard about this girls there and
which seem to say that there were things

71
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,950
in mathematics that you just couldn't 
prove.

72
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,580
And I didn't like that idea,
but I,

73
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,443
when I heard the,
when I went to this course by steen and 

74
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,750
he explained what it really says and 
what it says is,

75
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,220
suppose you've got a method of proving 
things in mathematics.

76
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,040
And when I say things,
I mean things with numbers.

77
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,730
That one famous example is fair Mars 
last year,

78
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,450
uh,
there's the Goldberg conjecture,

79
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,284
which isn't yet proved that every,
even number bigger than two is the sum 

80
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,160
of two prime numbers.
This is sort of example of the thing.

81
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,160
It's just sort of mathematical things 
about numbers,

82
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,030
which you can see what they mean.
Uh,

83
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,790
but it may be very difficult to see 
whether it's true or untrue.

84
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,570
But the idea often is in mathematics 
you've got a system of methods of proof.

85
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,193
And the key thing about these methods of
proof is that you can have a computer 

86
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,370
check.
Whether you've done it right.

87
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,350
So these rules,
you know,

88
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,243
they could be adding in B,
it's the same as bna and things like 

89
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:55,630
that.
And you,

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,380
um,
if you give you,

91
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,230
you say to the computer,
say,

92
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,303
here's a Theorem,
like Goldbar conjecture and you see 

93
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:07,684
whether it can be proved and you say,
maybe I've got a proof and this follows 

94
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,780
the steps and you give it to the 
computer and it says,

95
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,070
Yep,
you've done it right.

96
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,263
It's true.
Or maybe it will say you've done it 

97
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:18,964
right and it's not true.
Or it may not see anything but just go 

98
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:24,340
on forever.
But these are the sorts of outcomes.

99
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,174
And the point about it is that if you 
believe that these procedures do give 

100
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:30,910
you a proof,
in other words,

101
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,970
that if the algorithm says,
yeah,

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,240
it's true,
then you believe that it is true because

103
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,830
you've understood the,
all the rules.

104
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,390
He looked at the first one,
so yeah,

105
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,530
that's okay.
You look at the second one said,

106
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,780
mom,
oh yeah,

107
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,621
I see.
Okay,

108
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:46,450
that's great.
And you go all the way down.

109
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,740
And as long as you convinced all those 
rules work and if it says yes,

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,750
that's something you believe.
Okay,

111
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,230
now what girl shows as he constructs a 
very specific sentence,

112
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,600
a statement which is a number thing 
like,

113
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,310
like we fair most lost their arm or 
something to think about numbers,

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,833
which what he shows is if you trust this
algorithm for proving mathematical 

115
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,424
things,
then you can see by the way it's 

116
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,454
constructed that it's true,
but you can also see by the way it's 

117
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:23,420
constructed that it cannot be proved by 
this procedure.

118
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,393
Now,
this was amazing to me because it tells 

119
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,940
me that,
okay,

120
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,213
you cannot formalize your understanding 
in in a scheme which you could put on a 

121
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:37,754
computer.
You see this statement which skeletal 

122
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,933
comes up with is something you can see 
on the basis of the same understanding 

123
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,970
that allows you to trust the rules that 
it's true,

124
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,450
but that is not actually derived by the 
rules.

125
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,153
It you see,
it's true by virtue of your belief in 

126
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:58,994
the rules.
And this to me was amazing and I 

127
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:02,834
thought,
Golly,

128
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,840
you know what's understanding?

129
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,740
What does it mean?
Is it something following rules?

130
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,780
This is an algorithm.
Well this more or less as,

131
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,300
it's not an algorithm because whenever 
it was,

132
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,440
there will be something that you could 
still see his true even though you don't

133
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:21,020
get it through the algorithm that you 
had in the first place.

134
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,120
So this was a lot of subtleties about 
this to people argue about endlessly.

135
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,313
But it was pretty convincing to me that 
the shows that we don't think when we 

136
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,044
understand something,
what's going on in our heads is not an 

137
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,870
algorithm.
It's not following rules,

138
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,363
it's something else.
It's something that requires our 

139
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:46,160
conscious appreciation of what we're 
thinking about.

140
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,640
I'm thinking it's a conscious thing and 
understanding is a conscious activity.

141
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,330
So I formed the view that conscious 
activities,

142
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,920
whatever they are,
not just that kind of thing,

143
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:58,754
but you know,
playing music or we're falling in love 

144
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,930
or whatever these things might be on,
not computations.

145
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,360
There's something else going on.
And then I thought,

146
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,440
because I,
you know,

147
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,274
I like to think of myself as a scientist
and I think that was going in our heads 

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,200
is according to the laws of physics and 
these laws of physics,

149
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,970
um,
pretty good.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,660
They seem to work well and the outside 
world.

151
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:28,160
And so I believe that the laws that work
in our heads are the same as those laws.

152
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,560
So I began to think about it.
Well,

153
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:33,120
what about Newton's mechanics?
Well,

154
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:33,954
you could put that on a computer.
What about Einstein's special 

155
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:38,900
relativity?
You could do that.

156
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,110
What about Maxwell's wonderful 
equations,

157
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:42,944
which tell you how less electricity and 
magnetism operates and light and radio 

158
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:49,970
waves and all these things.
That's all follows this beautiful set of

159
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:53,450
equations that Max will produced.
You can put that on a computer.

160
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,673
Okay.
Then you might have to about 

161
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,154
approximations and the,
these depend on continuous numbers 

162
00:08:58,981 --> 00:08:59,814
rather than discreet things,
but I didn't think that's the answer 

163
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,920
then I thought,
what about general relativity?

164
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,120
Einstein's theory of gravity with curved
space and all that.

165
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,300
We are familiar now with Lego,
this detector,

166
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,134
which is detected black hole spiraling 
into each other from distant galaxy and 

167
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,130
how do we know that those signals are 
black holes,

168
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,750
but well,
because of calculations,

169
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:22,584
people who put this thing on an 
algorithm and you know what those 

170
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:28,260
signals look like.
So Einstein's general relativity.

171
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:30,690
Sure you can put that in a coop on the 
computer.

172
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,510
What about quantum mechanics?
Well,

173
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:34,344
there's the famous equation of 
Schrodinger which tells you how a 

174
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:41,490
quantum state evolves.
You could put that on a computer too.

175
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,670
It's difficult in many ways.
There's many more parameters you have to

176
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,504
worry about,
but it's just this computable as these 

177
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:50,070
other things.
Well,

178
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:50,904
you see,
I then remember direct lecture you see 

179
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,803
and how it is that these things that 
work in the quantum world don't seem to 

180
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:04,440
work at the level of classical big 
things.

181
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,023
And it all depends on this process of 
what's called measurement in quantum 

182
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:12,690
mechanics.
And the measurement process is something

183
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:16,500
that you learn how to do,
but it's not the Schrodinger equation.

184
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,940
It's something else.
And Schroeder himself was very intrigued

185
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:21,774
by this fact that his own equation gives
you nonsense and you the famous 

186
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:31,860
Schrodinger's cat where he produces a 
situation in which the cat would be dead

187
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:36,180
and alive at the same time.
He produced that in an example simply to

188
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:37,014
demonstrate that roughly speaking,
his equation gives you nonsense under 

189
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:42,444
these circumstances.
So there's something else and the 

190
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:48,390
something else goes beyond our current 
quantum mechanics.

191
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,070
And it tells you what happens when the 
quantum state makes a decision between,

192
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,130
doesn't follow the Schrodinger equation 
of one thing or the other.

193
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,323
No,
everybody knows that who does quantum 

194
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:59,670
mechanics,
but they think,

195
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:00,504
oh it's what's called making a 
measurement and you're allowed to do 

196
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:03,054
something different.

197
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,130
But that didn't make sense to me.
And so I had the view that okay,

198
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,993
there is a big gap and our understanding
and if there is something in the world 

199
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,780
which isn't something you could put on a
computer,

200
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,660
that's where it is.
So the view,

201
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:22,660
I held that for a long time and uh,
that there,

202
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:27,661
there's something non computable,
something beyond computation involved in

203
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:31,770
our understandings of things.
So that's a view of health for ages.

204
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,100
I didn't do much with it.
I just held the view until,

205
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,500
I think there was a radio talk between 
Marvin Minsky and Edward,

206
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,111
Fred,
Ken,

207
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:42,690
and they were explaining about what 
computers can do.

208
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,000
And they were talking about,
okay,

209
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:47,610
you have a computer,
two computers talking to each other over

210
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:48,444
there and you walk up to the room and 
the time you've walked up the room to 

211
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,890
the computers,
they have computed.

212
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,733
Community communicates with each other 
more thoughts than the human race ever 

213
00:11:58,991 --> 00:11:59,980
has done.
You see?

214
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,611
And I thought,
well,

215
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:01,444
I see where you're coming from,
but I don't think that's what's 

216
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,580
happening in,
in human communication.

217
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:10,690
Human understanding is something 
different from what computers do.

218
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,733
And consciousness is the key thing.
Consciousness is something different 

219
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,740
from computation.
So I've held that view.

220
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,250
But then when I heard this talk by 
Minsky and um,

221
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,780
and fred skin,
I thought,

222
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,310
well,
I had ideas of writing a book some time,

223
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:28,420
you a long time in the future when I'm 
retired.

224
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:30,970
This is some while back I said,
and I thought,

225
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,070
well,
maybe this gives you the focus.

226
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,430
And so I wrote this book called the 
emperor's new mind,

227
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,160
which was supposed to be saying,
well,

228
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:40,960
you know,
we,

229
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,853
uh,
everybody seems to be thinking one 

230
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:44,500
thing,
but yeah,

231
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,830
the little kid notices that the emperor 
doesn't have any clothes.

232
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,250
So it was the,
uh,

233
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,740
that theme of that story,
which was the basis of the book.

234
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,670
So I say,
okay,

235
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,520
maybe a lots of people think that,
well,

236
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:00,910
we're doing this computing,
but if you stand back and you say,

237
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:02,500
well,
no,

238
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,393
there's something else going on.
So that was the basis of my thoughts 

239
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:07,954
about consciousness.
But I wrote this book thinking that by 

240
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:14,390
the time I got to the end of the book,
you see,

241
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:15,211
it was,
it was a lot,

242
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,080
a lot,
mostly about physics and mathematics and

243
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:17,914
things like that.
But I was really aiming for this thing 

244
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:22,390
about what's going on and conscious 
thinking.

245
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,411
And I thought,
well,

246
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:26,020
I'll learn a bit about neurophysiology 
and so on.

247
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:28,060
And by the time I get to the end of the 
book,

248
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,730
uh,
know pretty well what it could be.

249
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,803
I didn't got to the end of the book and 
I just sort of tapered off rather than 

250
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:36,850
with something a little bit 
unbelievable.

251
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,450
And that was the end.
Now you see,

252
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,284
I hope that this book would stimulate 
young people to get interested in 

253
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:46,720
science and that sort of thing,
that mathematics.

254
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,840
And that was fine.
And when the book was published,

255
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,943
I didn't get letters from young kids.
I got letters from old retired people 

256
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:54,844
who,
the ones who'd had the time to read my 

257
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,480
book.
Okay,

258
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:00,640
well that was a little disappointing,
but okay,

259
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,650
I'm glad the old retired people like my 
book.

260
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,173
But the other thing was I got a letter 
from Stuart Hameroff and this letter 

261
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,453
said more or less,
I think you don't appreciate that 

262
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:14,110
there's something else going on.
Not Neurons.

263
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:14,944
I mean the neurons,
I could see you couldn't isolate the 

264
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:18,424
quantum effects and that the,
you get the what's called an 

265
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:22,554
environmental decoherence would happen 
and you get no way of keeping the 

266
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:28,870
quantum state to the level that you need
in this picture.

267
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,060
So I really,
I didn't have it,

268
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,433
but Stuart Hameroff pointed out to me 
these little things called microtubules 

269
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:41,430
and he'd built up a theory that 
microtubules are absolutely fundamental.

270
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:42,274
The consciousness.
He had his own reasons for believing 

271
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:46,360
that I had never heard of them at that 
time,

272
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,950
but then I checked up,
you know,

273
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:48,784
I get lots of letters from people who 
maybe don't make sense sometimes the 

274
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:55,580
letters and this one I thought,
well this is another one.

275
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,190
Then I realized these microtubules are 
there and they looked like just the kind

276
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,024
of thing that could well be supporting 
the kind of level of quantum mechanics 

277
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:11,561
up to a level where you could expect the
the quantum state to sort of collapse.

278
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,304
That's the terminology.
People using quantum mechanic micro 

279
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:18,350
tubules are inside brain neurons.
They are indeed.

280
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,120
And this is a recent discovery for them.
No,

281
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,700
they're actually in lots of cells.

282
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,080
You see,
people often complain,

283
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,310
oh,
they're in your liver too,

284
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,144
not just your brain.
So why isn't your liver conscious and 

285
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:28,514
all that.
But it has to do with the organization 

286
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:33,290
of them and the nature of them,
the particular kind of microtubules,

287
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,120
how they're,
how they're arranged,

288
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:35,954
which is different in the brain.
How does it vary in the brain compared 

289
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:40,860
to other cells?
I think one big difference,

290
00:15:40,861 --> 00:15:42,920
although not Stewart emphasizes,
there's so much,

291
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:43,754
there are two kinds of microtubules.
They're the ones who have a lattice and 

292
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:49,610
the bead lattice and the a lattice ones 
are,

293
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:50,444
they're very symmetrical ones.
There are tubes and they look the same 

294
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,610
all the way around.
They've got a very beautiful arrangement

295
00:15:55,611 --> 00:16:00,611
of these proteins called Tubulin and 
they make a very nice arrangement,

296
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,590
which is connected with fibonacci 
numbers and things like that.

297
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,830
So they look a bit like for cones,
but there were powerful.

298
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,641
They're not,
they don't,

299
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,660
um,
take her off.

300
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,000
But um,
the thing is in the brain,

301
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,260
I think most of microtubules are 
probably what I be lattice ones.

302
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:21,770
And they're don't have so much symmetry.
They've got like a sort of seemed on the

303
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,963
one side and they're very important in 
transporting some substances around 

304
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,100
cells and so on.
And Microsoft was all sorts of things.

305
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:35,360
They don't just do what what stuart and 
I think they may be doing in the brain.

306
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,583
So the idea is that in the brain they're
organized differently and probably the 

307
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:43,460
ones that are important have a lattice 
ones,

308
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,294
which is a very symmetrical ones.
And for a long time people couldn't see 

309
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,880
the difference and um,
cause they look very similar.

310
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,353
Um,
and they may well be the ones that have 

311
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,720
to be in pyramidal cells as a particular
kind of cell.

312
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,113
So you know,
one of the things that interested in me 

313
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,114
a lot is how it is that not all parts of
the brain are the same in this respect 

314
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:06,914
is that you've got the cerebrum,
this is the part at the top and divided 

315
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:11,210
down the middle on that.

316
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,073
When you see brains,
that's what you normally see with the 

317
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,840
convolutions in,
in the,

318
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:16,683
in it,
but right underneath and at the back 

319
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,020
there's a thing called the cerebellum,
which more it looks more like a,

320
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,100
like a ball of wool or something.
And the Cerebellum,

321
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,753
and it may still be argument about this,
but it seems to be that it's completely 

322
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:33,890
unconscious and it has comparable number
of neurons,

323
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,220
far more connections between neurons and
the cerebrum.

324
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,563
And it's what takes control.
And maybe when you're driving your car 

325
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:42,910
and you're thinking about something else
and you,

326
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,793
you don't,
you're not thinking what you're doing 

327
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,160
because it's unconscious.
And the unconscious control,

328
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,283
you know,
a pianist who was very expert and moves 

329
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,990
the fingers around and plays a note with
a little finger,

330
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,490
that pns doesn't think,
well,

331
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,220
I've got to move that muscle this way 
and this bone that way and so on.

332
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,070
And it's,
it's all controlled unconsciously.

333
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,383
And a lot of this unconscious control is
done somewhere else in the cerebellum 

334
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,580
when you,
when you get really skilled.

335
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,990
So,
uh,

336
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,310
it seemed to me,
okay,

337
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:13,320
you've got different kinds of structures
different,

338
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,560
and it could well be that these 
pyramidal cells,

339
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,380
which have a particular organization of 
microtubules,

340
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,970
are the ones that were,
that consciousness is really coming,

341
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,680
coming to light.
Mainly,

342
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,120
I don't know.
There's a lot which is,

343
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:30,870
which is not known about this 
controversial and all sorts of things,

344
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,040
but the cerebellum seems to be different
and organized differently.

345
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,874
So it's not just how many neurons,
how many connections are there because 

346
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,830
there are more in the cerebellum,
so it's not that same else.

347
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,743
Do they know this from observing the 
brain through Fmr dry or something like 

348
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:47,490
that during particular activities?
Like Ah,

349
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,610
I don't know.
I would imagine he partly just examining

350
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:51,444
it went from dead people and looking at 
brains and trying to estimate how many 

351
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:56,190
neurons their own it.

352
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,540
Right.
But how would they know what,

353
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,830
which partial,
which is consciousness.

354
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,760
It's pretty mellow.
I don't know that they do know that when

355
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:04,390
I guess,
but the,

356
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,850
the cerebellum,
there is a bit of an argument about that

357
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,110
I think whether it's completely 
unconscious or not,

358
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,280
but it seems that actions that,
that are carried out by the cerebellum.

359
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:17,100
You don't,
you're not aware of what you're doing.

360
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,440
But I mean it's,
you know,

361
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:20,274
if he had the tennis player who has to 
think very carefully about whether with 

362
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,600
tilt the ball now that the control of 
what you're doing,

363
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,530
so the overall control,
it's probably done with the cerebrum,

364
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,890
but the cerebellum is controlling the 
detailed motions,

365
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,200
how the fingers move and all that kind 
of thing.

366
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,523
And then you'd make sure that if you 
play your thinks going to hit the ball 

367
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:45,951
down down the line there and then the,
the rest is done under the control of an

368
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,530
unconscious procedure.

369
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,600
I mean,
I may be simplifying,

370
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,090
but you're saying,
so you're saying that there's,

371
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,680
we don't totally understand,
but we know that there's different parts

372
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:01,740
of the brain that are responsible for 
different activities and some activities

373
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,050
don't seem to be conscious.
Yes.

374
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,380
Yes.
I mean,

375
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,910
I think it's probably the case.
No,

376
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,760
I'm,
I'm maybe,

377
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,950
I don't know.
I shouldn't make a statement and I don't

378
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:11,784
really know,
but certainly there are lots of 

379
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:17,430
different parts of the cerebrum which 
maybe,

380
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,633
which maybe not conscious too,
so I'm not saying that the whole thing 

381
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,610
is capable of being conscious.
It's,

382
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:25,860
they seem to be differences in different
parts,

383
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,963
but are you convinced that microtubules 
are responsible for consciousness or 

384
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:32,574
it's a primary theory?
I think they're the one of the best 

385
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:38,790
candidates.
I you see,

386
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,780
I don't think it's only microtia.
I Dunno.

387
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,380
I'm not sure what Stuart Hameroff view 
on this is.

388
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,573
He certainly thinks the micro g was 
exceedingly important in consciousness 

389
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:50,680
and I think he's right.
That's the feeling I get and he's done a

390
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:54,730
lot of work on trying to find a what?
Anesthetic gases.

391
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:55,564
It's an important,
one of the important ways you can tell 

392
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,620
things about conscious and most of it 
you can't,

393
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:01,360
it's just hearsay.
What does it vary?

394
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,194
It is,
but one of the important ways you can 

395
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:09,391
tell something about consciousness is 
what turns it off in a reversible way.

396
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,210
In Stuart's job is,
do you know he's an anesthesiologist?

397
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,713
He puts people to sleep well,
I think he would complain if I say 

398
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,133
putting it to sleep because under 
anesthetic is actually different for 

399
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,523
sleep,
but you make them unconscious in a 

400
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,104
reversible way.
You want to make sure you think you can 

401
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:29,860
wake them up again.
And a,

402
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:30,694
it's obviously a very skills thing,
but I guess a lot of his colleagues 

403
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,380
might be a skilled at doing it,
but don't.

404
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,690
They asked the questions about what 
they're actually doing from the point of

405
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:42,730
view of the biology and the physics and 
so on.

406
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,953
So it still,
it was really interested in that 

407
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:47,680
question.
Partly I think the thing is like,

408
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,543
oh my tosas cell division and he was 
very struck by the way that the 

409
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:57,180
chromosomes or lion lion up and that 
there's these microtubules which pulling

410
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,980
them and they're really a big part in,
in,

411
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,920
in,
in the structure of cells and how they,

412
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,060
how they behave and so on.
But why they are consciousness.

413
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,100
Well,
I guess it was an experience with,

414
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:13,360
with um,
putting people under anesthetics and the

415
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:16,600
fact that the gases which put you to 
sleep,

416
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,670
and there again,
I shouldn't say to sleep,

417
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:23,410
but put you on the anesthetic.
I'm very unconnected chemically.

418
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,244
They're different kinds of things be yet
they still seem to have the same effect 

419
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,260
and to understand what it is that they 
affect is,

420
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,223
you know,
there's a lot of his interest is to do 

421
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:34,534
with that.

422
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,133
So just by putting someone unconscious 
and registering what parts of the brain 

423
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,683
are no longer active,
this is what they're using to sort of 

424
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,900
reverse engineered by turning those 
parts on.

425
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,630
That's what enables consciousness is 
this,

426
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,693
well,
I think it's probably a simplification 

427
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,580
of what's going on,
but that's,

428
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,840
that's a good,
uh,

429
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,570
first first step.
Yes.

430
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,480
Consciousness becomes as a subject,
it's very,

431
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,820
it's,
it's very susceptible to woo.

432
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,900
Right.
Indeed.

433
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,210
I guess it's one of those weird ones 
where people want to start talking about

434
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:14,750
souls and universal consciousness and 
they start,

435
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,333
it gets,

436
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,433
yeah,
it's a murky area and there's no clear 

437
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,334
borderline with cc student runs these 
consciousness conferences and he's very 

438
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:25,204
broad minded.
He has people all sorts of different 

439
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:31,240
views like the ones you mentioned,
and it's not necessarily his view,

440
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:34,120
but he likes to get a broad perspective 
on what's going on.

441
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,440
I,
I,

442
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,970
I'm a bit more narrow minded than he is 
on these matters.

443
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,030
Yeah,
I am too.

444
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:41,930
I'm very skeptical because I just,
I understand the inclination that people

445
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:45,140
have to lean towards the woo then it's 
very fun.

446
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,220
Yes.
It's for

447
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,210
whatever reason people are inclined to 
lean towards,

448
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,890
do you ever see,
you saw that movie,

449
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,380
I don't know if you saw a,
what the bleep do we know?

450
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,980
Oh yes,
I did not go.

451
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,083
That kind of stuff.
That was a little worrying to me that 

452
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,500
yes,
yes,

453
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:01,910
indeed.
Now that did worry me.

454
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:02,691
Yeah.
Well,

455
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,710
it's uh,
it's just,

456
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,880
you know,
it was written,

457
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,230
the movie was made by a cult leader and 
now it gets a little squirrelly.

458
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,730
Right.
You're absolutely right.

459
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,890
And I,
I,

460
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,460
as I say,
I was distinctly,

461
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,850
I'm sure you were a lot of people that I
know there were like yourself,

462
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,490
we're worried,
but it's,

463
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,460
this is something that everyone 
contemplates.

464
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,710
Like what makes you conscious?
What is the soul?

465
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,570
Is it a real thing?
What is,

466
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:27,404
what is your consciousness?
Is it simply just your own biology 

467
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:30,974
trying to calculate your environment and
looking out for his best interests and 

468
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,240
trying to procreate and move forward 
with the,

469
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,593
the genes that had has,
or is it something almost mystical or 

470
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:42,020
far more complicated?

471
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,973
Maybe even instead of the word mystical 
might be tainted maybe something far 

472
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,710
more complex than we're currently able 
to understand?

473
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,420
I think to some extent I would agree to 
it because it's any different,

474
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,750
I need to have some internal perception 
of the external world and yeah,

475
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,150
have to think abstractly and all these 
things,

476
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,460
it's totally different from a way a 
baseball runs through the air.

477
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:08,294
And what,
what makes it spin and different than 

478
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:14,360
every other conscious animal?
I'm not so sure about that.

479
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,730
No,
I think the difference isn't that big.

480
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,260
I mean,
okay,

481
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,041
we,
you know,

482
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,260
we use language to a degree.
I mean,

483
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:24,110
some animals use language to some kind 
of degree.

484
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,770
There's a huge difference in degree.
I agree with that.

485
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,340
But whether it's a difference in kind,
I'm not a total sure.

486
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,750
Um,
you know,

487
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:33,584
you watch these nature movies and I 
remember seeing one about elephants and 

488
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:40,700
this was about how the elephants were.

489
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,930
They always,
uh,

490
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,520
they're always led by a female elephant 
that's not relevant to the story.

491
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:49,280
But they were trying to go from a to B,
I don't know,

492
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,143
maybe what it was.
And they thought that was a whole herd 

493
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:52,664
of them then would be doing that.
But then at a certain point they made a 

494
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:59,411
detour and they went off to a place 
where the leader of the elephant herd,

495
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,273
her sister had died and that the bones,
the tusks I suppose with their bones 

496
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:10,130
anyway with that and the elephants 
picked him up,

497
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,173
handed them around and and seem to 
caress them and move them around and 

498
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:17,540
then they went back and joined to the 
the route that they want.

499
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,453
Now what does that tell us?
There's something going on which is not 

500
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:26,660
just some machine behaving like a robot.
There's some,

501
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:29,270
some feelings that that we can 
appreciate.

502
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,600
I mean another one I remember was one 
with these,

503
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:36,950
a punt I African hunting dogs and the 
dogs.

504
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,073
You see there's a route where some 
antelopes we tend to go and had to go 

505
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:41,774
across the river and when they got to 
the point where the crossfit and that 

506
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:44,150
slow

507
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,590
down and,
and make their way to get across.

508
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,530
Now these hunting dogs,
you could see them,

509
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,393
I think it was taken from the air and 
they would go along towards this place 

510
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:56,190
where the river was and then they would 
break into two.

511
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,280
So half of them would go one way towards
the,

512
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,353
and they would hide just where the river
starts and the other half would go and 

513
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:06,060
chase the antelopes.
They'd gone bark and make an awful noise

514
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,013
chasing them right there.
And then the other ones were pants on 

515
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,520
them.
I mean there's something there which is,

516
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,893
you know,
there'd been working it out between 

517
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,210
themselves.
How's it doing?

518
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,980
Commute communication of some kind.
Yes.

519
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,130
And I think there is,
what will you call understanding.

520
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:23,964
Okay.
It's a more primitive level and then 

521
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,610
human understanding.
But nevertheless there was something,

522
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,270
there's no sort of clean dividing line 
in my view it's,

523
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:35,220
it's,
it's pretty continuous.

524
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,400
Yeah.
And this exists in wolves as well,

525
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:39,440
so very,
very similar behavior.

526
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,510
And they do seem to have not just verbal
but nonverbal communication.

527
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:45,344
They seem to have some understanding of 
what the task is and what their roles 

528
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:49,424
are in the task.
And even though there's not as many 

529
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:57,080
variables maybe as human life there,
there definitely seems to be a conscious

530
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:58,550
awareness of,
first of all,

531
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,393
their,
their position in the hierarchy of the 

532
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:05,030
tribe of the pack,
but also their,

533
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,020
what their objective is.
This,

534
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,873
this is not a selfish objective.
It's a group objective and they operate 

535
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,170
as a group and they do move like those 
African dogs you were talking about.

536
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,400
Yeah.
No,

537
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:17,660
it's fascinating.
I love that.

538
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:18,494
Yeah.
And there's a lot of indication that 

539
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,590
we're certainly chimps and elephants and
things in dolphins.

540
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:25,820
You,
we know about them,

541
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:28,670
but I imagine it goes quite far down,
I should think.

542
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,100
How much have you studied a Octopi?
They're fascinating.

543
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,870
Yeah.
Yes.

544
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,501
No,
I haven't.

545
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:34,334
There's a new book about them,
which I haven't gotten the chance to 

546
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,250
read yet.
I wanted to read it.

547
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,800
I think they're,
they're highly intelligent.

548
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,940
Yes,
yes.

549
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,863
Yeah.
I've only different really paying 

550
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,710
attention to them for a few years.
I have a,

551
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:45,544
a good friend.
My Friend Remy Warren was doing a 

552
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:49,010
television show,
um,

553
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,933
called Apex Predator.
We studied the way different animals 

554
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:57,431
hunted and he started studying the way 
octopus and um,

555
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,660
uh,
cuddle fish and all these different,

556
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,760
yeah,
different,

557
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,210
uh,
Octopi and what the way they could adapt

558
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,340
to their environment by changing their 
actual,

559
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,720
they'll,
they'll not just to look,

560
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:09,554
but the texture of their skin 
instantaneously and how this is not 

561
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:15,680
really understood how the,
not only how they do it,

562
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,950
but how they know what they're,
what's below them,

563
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:20,480
what they're copying.
Yes.

564
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:21,314
That they somehow or another can figure 
out how to blend in almost perfectly 

565
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:26,810
with their environment.
It's amazing isn't it?

566
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,620
They also can open jars and they can 
climb out of tanks.

567
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,663
There was one guy had a,
he had a camera on his tank because he 

568
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:36,314
had two tanks and one of them had very 
expensive tropical fish and the other 

569
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:42,070
one had his octopus and he was

570
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,920
trying to figure out what was happening 
to his expensive tropical fish.

571
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:49,030
We put a camera on it and the octopus 
was climbing out of the tank,

572
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,030
walking across the ground,
climbing into the other tank,

573
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,740
killing one of the fish,
eating it,

574
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,650
and then going back into his tank.
Yes.

575
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,820
Yeah,
that's heavy.

576
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,470
Well,
there's one I saw,

577
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,340
but I think I heard the description or I
read it.

578
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,410
I think I read it about some experiments
on testing the intelligence of octopuses

579
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:09,160
or,
and they had a,

580
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,253
a little thing they had to pull the 
chain and then open a door and get food 

581
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:13,984
out.
And this octopus was thinking then I'm 

582
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:18,070
getting fed up with this thing and so 
yank the chain.

583
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,460
It came right off and then it rose to 
the top and started to squirting all the

584
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:26,440
people in their white coats.
So I know that was pretty good.

585
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,273
You know,
there's something else going on that 

586
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,160
Justin is something going on.
Absolutely.

587
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:35,310
Now when you,
if you weren't pressed for tea to figure

588
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:40,270
this out in some sort of a,
a paper that you had to display in front

589
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,320
of scientists.
If you were,

590
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,840
you were like,
you're trying to figure out like what do

591
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,700
you think it is?
Like what,

592
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,630
what do you think consciousness is where
you say,

593
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,050
I mean to,
it's going too far to think,

594
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,400
you know,
I know that the answer,

595
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:55,234
is there anything of course.
I just think that this issue of having 

596
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,303
some kind of quantum state,
which preserves itself up to a certain 

597
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:04,924
level and the microtubules at least 
suggested something where you could 

598
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,790
isolate them from the outside and the 
symmetry of these things is important.

599
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,900
And there are other structures.
I suspect it's not just microtubules.

600
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,310
I suspect there are these um,
classrooms,

601
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,710
these are molecules which inhabit the 
synapses.

602
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,113
And um,
and the thing about these ones is that 

603
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:33,970
they're incredibly symmetrical.
They're like a soccer ball.

604
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,973
You know there you have these pentagons 
and excellence and each vertex you've 

605
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:39,874
got a protein,
it's called a [inaudible] and they 

606
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:44,050
joined themselves along the edges of 
the,

607
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:45,660
of the pattern of the soccer mom.
Okay.

608
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,680
But it's just the,
it's just a substance.

609
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:51,514
I mean it's made of these proteins and 
what are they doing hanging around in 

610
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:56,890
the synopsis,
I dunno,

611
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,290
but they,
the symmetry has a key role.

612
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:02,260
There's a thing called the young teller 
effect in quantum mechanics,

613
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,120
which tells you that when you have a 
highly symmetrical structure like that,

614
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,510
then there can be a big gap between the 
lowest energy level and the next one.

615
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:15,100
And there can be information in this 
lowest energy level,

616
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:19,090
which can be shielded from the higher 
energy levels.

617
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,390
So this is a sort of the suggestion that
some kind of quantum phenomenon is going

618
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:25,900
on in the serious way.

619
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,980
And there's a lot to understand there.
I mean synopsis themselves,

620
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:30,814
that kind of strange things.
You might think if you were going to 

621
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:33,274
build a brain,
why don't you just sold a little wires 

622
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,910
together,
the connections,

623
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,753
you see what you're doing.
Having this thing with all the chemist 

624
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,770
chemicals transferring this information 
from one side,

625
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,003
I don't know,
but it's something very needed for by 

626
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,663
the system and it's all tied up with 
these classrooms there and and 

627
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,103
Cytoskeleton structures,
which microtubials I one of the main 

628
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,910
constituents.
So you see,

629
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,100
I don't know that there's a lot to 
learn,

630
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,580
I'm sure.
So it seems like there's a,

631
00:33:00,581 --> 00:33:01,414
a bunch of different factors.
There's the biological understanding of 

632
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:04,580
the brain itself.
Yeah.

633
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,533
And then there's the understanding of 
the actual nature of cells and of 

634
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:11,294
reality itself that this is being more 
illuminated by science with every new 

635
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:16,810
discovery.

636
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,200
You know,
we're getting a better understanding,

637
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:22,840
deeper and deeper as to the very nature 
of matter and of of the,

638
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,683
of these structures themselves.
I think it is getting deep into the end 

639
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:27,194
of the way the physical world operates 
and things we don't understand about it 

640
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,690
just yet.
Yes.

641
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,320
I mean the biology is one side of it and
not,

642
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:36,650
you know,
coming as an outsider,

643
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:37,484
I get struck by seth and things.
I'm going to be quite familiar with the 

644
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:43,340
fact that the right signs of the 
cerebrum controllers,

645
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,530
the left hand and the left hand,
the right hand,

646
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,260
but then you look at this and it's not 
just that.

647
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,350
What about the soles of your feet right 
at the top.

648
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,483
What about your eyes?
They signals right at the back you can 

649
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:56,474
think this is the most ridiculous 
construction you you're going to do the 

650
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:59,840
worst possible place.

651
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:00,763
Yes.
There must be a reason and the 

652
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:02,954
cerebellum is different cause cerebellum
is the left side controls the left side 

653
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:07,850
and the right side.
The right side.

654
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,110
Did this something going on which 
involves these signals getting,

655
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,970
having to cross each other or whatever 
it is.

656
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:14,804
I Dunno.
Well we'd like to think that there's a 

657
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:19,130
reason but then we look at other 
biological life forms and they look kind

658
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:21,260
of preposterous.
Like a platypus.

659
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:22,940
For instance.
You look at that and go,

660
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,920
what is that?
It was out of the experiment.

661
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:30,140
Is that a prototype that just ran wild 
in Islam as well?

662
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:30,974
I get it.
You got to think of it in terms of 

663
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,680
natural select shoreham source.
Yeah.

664
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,870
I guess the circumstances though,
I don't know.

665
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,170
In Australia,
wherever you find it must be specific.

666
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,740
I guess the a lot of that was because 
they were isolated from,

667
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,603
from the rest of the,
so you get sort of strange animals in 

668
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:54,320
Australia and in New Zealand where a lot
of isolation from,

669
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,820
from the rest of the evolution.

670
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,830
So they did their own thing there.
Yeah.

671
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:00,920
Marsupials which is intriguing,
isn't it?

672
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,160
Well the,
the,

673
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,930
the,
the phrase quantum is another one that's

674
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,320
fraught with woo indeed.
Right.

675
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:13,490
And some people like Deepak Chopra and 
the like,

676
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,360
they love to use that word because as 
soon as you use that word you could kind

677
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:19,050
of get away with almost anything 
afterwards.

678
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,513
Yes.
I have to say I have quantum mechanics 

679
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:24,164
is a strange thing and it's,
I saw the blame me for certain things I 

680
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,550
don't want,
I don't want to be unfair here.

681
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:30,384
I'm not saying no as I blame it.
It gives some people have the 

682
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:33,950
impression,
okay,

683
00:35:33,951 --> 00:35:35,600
the fact your theory doesn't make any 
sense.

684
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,070
That's nothing against it.
You say crazy things.

685
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,083
Quantum mechanics is crazy.
So we wanted to except some other crazy 

686
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:42,534
theory.
Of course quantum mechanics has the 

687
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:45,384
virtue of that.
It does agree with an awful lot of 

688
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,394
experiments.
It gives you a huge insight since the 

689
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:53,340
things that that one didn't have before.
So just the fact that it's crazy isn't,

690
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,590
isn't enough to,
to make,

691
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,750
to make it something you should study 
seriously.

692
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,323
Well,
um,

693
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,423
well it's very,
very difficult to understand even for 

694
00:36:03,321 --> 00:36:04,580
people who study it.
Yes,

695
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:06,860
indeed.
So for someone like myself,

696
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,150
I'm trying to pay attention to this 
without devoting my entire life to it.

697
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,463
And it gets,
it's becomes a big problem because 

698
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,300
there's,
yeah.

699
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,170
Yeah.
Are there too,

700
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:21,270
I in one of my books had tried to 
explain there are actually two mysteries

701
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,440
in quantum mechanics and they get 
muddled.

702
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,100
One of them is the whole subject is 
pretty crazy.

703
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,810
Yes.
But it's coherent and it makes sense.

704
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:33,220
And if you study it properly and you 
say,

705
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:33,621
okay,
that,

706
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:34,454
that makes sense.
And this includes things like non local 

707
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:38,884
effects where you can have two things 
now they know eating thousands of 

708
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,290
kilometers apart and you can see these 
quantum entanglement effects.

709
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,223
Yes,
there they are still in some sense 

710
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:49,960
connected with each other even though 
they're that far apart,

711
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,820
which is pretty amazing.
That's baffling.

712
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:52,923
That's baffling.
But that's part of the comprehensive or 

713
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:55,584
part of quantities.
It's muddied up because there's the 

714
00:36:58,421 --> 00:36:59,254
other part which has to do with this 
collapse of the wave function and 

715
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:05,080
standard quantum mechanics really 
doesn't make sense,

716
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,573
but people get them muddled in my year 
you think because this doesn't make 

717
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:09,724
sense and that's,
well it's all a bit crazy and so 

718
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:13,780
anything crazy is,
is is up for grabs,

719
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,420
but it seems to me that quantum 
mechanics,

720
00:37:16,421 --> 00:37:17,254
the things which are crazy and they do 
hang together and the theory works and 

721
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:20,314
you understand that that's fine,
but the things which involve the 

722
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:24,004
collapse of the wave function,
that's not fine because we don't have 

723
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:28,590
the right theory.

724
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,080
That's why it doesn't make logical sense
because it's not the right theory yet.

725
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,380
That's my view.
I mean,

726
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:39,670
I'm a minority and saying this,
most people who study the foundations of

727
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:40,600
quantum mechanics,
they,

728
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:41,434
well,
we haven't got the right interpretation 

729
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:43,414
right yet.
We have to think when it means and so 

730
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,360
on.
They don't think,

731
00:37:46,361 --> 00:37:47,194
well,
hmm,

732
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,093
maybe it's not quite right.
Maybe there's something when this 

733
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,483
affects get big enough,
something else comes in and we need a 

734
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:58,030
new insights and new theory.
So that's what I think

735
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,250
now in something like super position 
where something can be both still and in

736
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:05,980
motion at the same time.
As soon as you say that.

737
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,010
Yeah,
to the common person like myself,

738
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,240
my brain glazes over and uh,
my eyebrows raised up and I go,

739
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,110
okay,
what does,

740
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,033
and then you're talking about 
entanglement things hundreds of 

741
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,200
thousands of kilometers apart that are 
somehow or another interacting with each

742
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:22,840
other in a way that we don't totally 
understand.

743
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:26,470
Or we don't have a theory that 
absolutely explains in a concrete way

744
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,603
when it does,
as long as you don't get to the 

745
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:29,494
measurement,
the measurement entanglement part is 

746
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,490
pretty well understood.
But the measurement,

747
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,130
the measurement part is not be seen as 
the puzzles

748
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,770
about the entanglement is when you come 
to the measurement,

749
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,850
you make a measurement over here and the
measurement over there and they can be,

750
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,800
well now a thousand kilometers apart.
The record was only 143 or something.

751
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:48,920
It's a little while ago.
Wow.

752
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,691
That's,
it's a,

753
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:51,250
it's a long time,
a long distance,

754
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,970
but there's hardly any movement of 
material.

755
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,360
So the thing that you see in the scheme 
I have,

756
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:59,194
which involves the collapse of the wave 
function involves certain amount of 

757
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,740
displacement and mass.
Now,

758
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:10,630
if it's just photons that's light and 
these experiments tend to be just light,

759
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,350
then there's no mass displacement in the
state.

760
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,800
And so sure what quantum mechanics says 
is fine by me.

761
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,053
Okay.
It's hard to get your mind around and I 

762
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:23,380
certainly agree with that,
but it's logical.

763
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:28,030
It's not logical comes apart.
But when you worry about the measurement

764
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:31,090
issue and the collapse of the wave 
function and portal,

765
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,370
Schrodinger was very upset by this quite
right.

766
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,303
Yes.

767
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,443
Now when you discuss consciousness and 
the mystery of consciousness and then 

768
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,700
you take into account some of these 
characteristics that are being displayed

769
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:48,474
in the quantum world,
do you think that perhaps some of them 

770
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:54,930
are interchangeable or,
or similar to consciousness itself,

771
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:59,931
that there is some sort of a connection 
that human beings share and some,

772
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,440
some strange,
unique and miss or not,

773
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,890
not understood way yet?
I think one of the

774
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,260
careful about these things and sometimes
do well,

775
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:13,400
even Niels Bohr who is one of the 
founders of these ideas,

776
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,680
um,
and so,

777
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,623
uh,
he tried to make a philosophy out of 

778
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,340
quantum mechanics and what do you call 
it?

779
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:26,450
So complimentarity and so I think that's
going a bit far.

780
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:29,090
I don't really see cause there's no 
evidence for it.

781
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,540
I don't think so.
I think it's a bit misleading that one,

782
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,763
you can see analogies between things,
but I don't see myself that that should 

783
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:42,770
be taken much further than that.
But I,

784
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:44,270
you know,
maybe there's more there,

785
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,390
but you're open to the possibility 
should new information.

786
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

787
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,090
I mean,
if it comes to things like,

788
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,023
you know,
when people talk about it entanglements 

789
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:58,230
and things quantum states can spread to 
long distances,

790
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,030
does that mean that human beings minds 
can stretch to long distances and so on.

791
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,220
So the people will raise questions like 
that?

792
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:06,570
I don't think so.
Myself.

793
00:41:06,571 --> 00:41:08,310
I think that's,
that's pretty farfetched.

794
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,410
But you,
you know,

795
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:11,244
you might worry.
Well it could it be that there some 

796
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,180
quantum state which is shared between 
different individuals.

797
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,830
It's hard to see.
That could be,

798
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:22,230
unless they were,
well I meant if they're identical twins,

799
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,330
I suppose they were once in one cell at 
one time,

800
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,910
but you'd have to preserve that 
information all the way through.

801
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,830
And I just don't see how that can 
happen.

802
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,190
So I'm not a fan of trying to use 
quantum ideas

803
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,240
sort of directly and say human behavior 
or something.

804
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,500
I think the,
those analogies are pretty far fetched,

805
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,280
partly because the sorts of mathematics 
you use in quantum mechanics,

806
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:47,114
there's very specific to quantum 
mechanics and doesn't really apply to 

807
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,780
macroscopic behaviors.
So,

808
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,800
as I can see,
is this

809
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,600
thing that is,
uh,

810
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,530
that your ax asked about most often?

811
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,650
You mean in my research all together or 
just amongst the common people?

812
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,260
Like myself,
it's only one of them.

813
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,243
But you see,
it's slightly misleading when you're 

814
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,170
thinking about what my interests are 
because I had this,

815
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:15,921
as I say,
the,

816
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:19,370
I explained more or less the history of 
ideas there and I did write a book or at

817
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,530
least another one after that too.
In fact,

818
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:23,390
I guess I've written three books about 
that time.

819
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:25,850
That one was taken down lectures and so 
on.

820
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,150
Um,
but it's not what I do mainly,

821
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,590
right.
Main research is,

822
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:31,960
is,
is um,

823
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,520
cosmology.
Uh,

824
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,560
well thing is this area called twists 
the theory but necessarily go into that.

825
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,580
But it's meant to be foundational.
Quantum is a foundational physics,

826
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,320
not necessarily,
but general relativity.

827
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,154
I mean the,
I guess the work I did originally with 

828
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:53,060
people paid attention to is in,
in general relativity and black holes.

829
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,343
What a black hole is,
why we have the idea that they're there 

830
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:58,970
at all,
that sort of thing.

831
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,830
I worked on that one point.

832
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,063
Cosmology as a whole is one of the most 
terrifying concepts to me because I 

833
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:10,080
just,
when I start thinking about the size and

834
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:10,914
scale of everything,
I get to a certain point and my brain 

835
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:17,970
just shuts off.
There's not enough juice.

836
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,050
Well,
it's pretty huge.

837
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,690
One is has to think on a pretty huge 
scale,

838
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:23,943
but it's like so many things you,
it looks sort of mind boggling at first 

839
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:27,454
and then when you get used to the idea,
you can sort of play around with the 

840
00:43:30,731 --> 00:43:34,450
ideas and maybe forget how much bottling
it should be.

841
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:35,763
I was watching a documentary around 
supermassive black holes and they were 

842
00:43:37,691 --> 00:43:38,524
discussing how the size of this was,
I don't know if this is still a current 

843
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:44,950
theory.
This documentary was a few years old,

844
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,370
but they were saying that the,
there's a supermassive black hole inside

845
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:52,210
of every galaxy that's one half of 1% of
the mass of the entire galaxy.

846
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,280
And that they,
there's the,

847
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,233
one of the theories was that inside the 
supermassive black holes could be an 

848
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:00,004
entirely different universe with 
hundreds of billions of galaxies each 

849
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:04,630
with their own black holes.
And then it's

850
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,940
infinite.
Well,

851
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:07,410
you see,
I have a fairly,

852
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,480
an idea which I think the mainstream 
does still regarded as a bit crazy,

853
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:13,314
but not like that.
I don't think you're going to have much 

854
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:18,600
fun inside a black hole.
Nobody's in there.

855
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:19,620
Uh,
not,

856
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,401
not much.
Well,

857
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:21,234
you could have a really big black hole 
and there's a lot of time in there who 

858
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:25,110
really big one.
If you,

859
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:26,670
if you were in a space ship,
you could,

860
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,090
you could have a few parties before you 
can get hour.

861
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,010
Yes.
But I'm not sure

862
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,890
I recommend it.
Um,

863
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,350
no.
Uh,

864
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,283
yeah,
I'm in black holes are remarkable 

865
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:41,460
enough.
But I mean the thing I did,

866
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:46,461
which was in 1964 and the publish under 
65 which to show that black hose,

867
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,043
well I'm using a terminal knowledge that
wasn't around at that time that the 

868
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:56,730
black holes collide.
It was co gravitational collapse.

869
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,223
You see the,
this,

870
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,063
the history went back to originally I 
guess Chandra Sekhar Indian scientist 

871
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:05,220
when he was not quite 20,
I think,

872
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:06,570
I can't remember.
He's 19 or 20.

873
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,320
And he was going to England to study 
physics,

874
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,100
astronomy and so on.
And he worked on this problem about what

875
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:15,920
holes white doffs apart.
These are the,

876
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,530
is very massive stars,
the companion of serious,

877
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:20,364
serious as a white dwarf.
And he was doing calculations to find 

878
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:27,120
out whether they,
uh,

879
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,223
what the interior has a very 
particularly as struck structure of 

880
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,064
matter.

881
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,510
And he came to the conclusions if they 
had a bigger mass than a certain amount,

882
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:41,190
which is about a bit less than one and a
half times the sun's mass,

883
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,760
they wouldn't build a home selves apart.
And so they would collapse and he didn't

884
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,980
speculate on what had happened.
He just,

885
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:53,550
one is less there.
Some very modest comment he made is one,

886
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,240
we are left speculating on possibilities
or something.

887
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:02,930
But then that was in the 1930s,
I guess round about 1930 and much later,

888
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,630
just before the war.
Um,

889
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,170
cinema one 90 13 at west,
they're a bit later,

890
00:46:09,171 --> 00:46:10,004
I guess 1939,
there was a paper by oppenheimer of 

891
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,253
atomic bomb fame and Schneider,
which is a student of his Hartland 

892
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:24,630
Snyder.
And they produced a model which was,

893
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:27,330
uh,
a solution of the Einstein Equations,

894
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,553
which describes a cloud of dust which 
collapses and becomes what we now call 

895
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:36,340
the black hole there.

896
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,800
This was the first clear picture of 
collapsed to a black hole.

897
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,000
Now in their picture,
they made two huge assumptions,

898
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:49,320
but one of them is does the material,
that means it didn't have any pressure.

899
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,840
And so you could imagine when it gets 
close to itself,

900
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:54,450
it might would push away if it had 
pressure on it in any way.

901
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:56,670
But this was just dust.
That was one thing,

902
00:46:56,671 --> 00:47:00,930
but more important that the model was 
exactly symmetrical.

903
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,820
So it was just very clear,
symmetrical all matter,

904
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,760
falling in the dust particles would be 
focused right into the central point.

905
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,073
And so it's not so hard to believe that 
you get a singularity where the density 

906
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:14,634
goes infinite,
the curvatures go infinite and your 

907
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:20,010
equations go crazy.
So at that point,

908
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:22,710
when the dust reaches the middle point,
okay,

909
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:25,920
it's not so surprising because it's a 
very contrived situation.

910
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,290
So I think a lot of people thought,
well,

911
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,260
perhaps we shouldn't take it seriously.
They,

912
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,113
I think they weren't sure.
But then there was a paper by two 

913
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:36,940
Russians caulk flattened lifshitz and 
the Kolodny cough.

914
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:42,570
And they seem to have proved that you 
didn't get singularities and the general

915
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:45,550
case that somehow it was swirl around 
and switch out again.

916
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,350
You see?
So that was a possibility.

917
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,293
And then there was this discovery,
I think in 1962 when Martin Schmidt to 

918
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:56,240
Dutch astronomer.
Okay.

919
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,200
Dutch American,
I think where he was living there at the

920
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:00,034
time,
I don't remember,

921
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,890
but he observed,
became what we call the,

922
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,163
the first quasar.
So this was an object of which was 

923
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,910
irradiating an awful amount of energy,
far more than an entire galaxy.

924
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,560
But it seemed to be a very small thing.
It couldn't be much bigger than the size

925
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,394
of the solar system if even that big,
because it variations in brightness 

926
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:27,400
indicated that the,
it's the speed of light could size of it

927
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:32,000
had to be comparable with the same speed
at which the variations in,

928
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:33,280
in,
in,

929
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:35,650
um,
in Brighton this came about.

930
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,780
So it seemed to be an object that was 
enormously energetic,

931
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:41,643
producing more energy than a whole 
galaxy and varying with such a degree 

932
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:46,534
that it must be fairly small.
And this raised the question of whether 

933
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:53,650
it was small enough to be what we now 
call a black hole.

934
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,730
In other words,
it's,

935
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,130
um,
there's a thing called the short,

936
00:48:57,131 --> 00:48:57,964
short radius.
Schwab shocked was the man who first 

937
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:02,950
discovered the solutions of Einstein's 
equations,

938
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:03,784
which described this spherical body,
but he didn't extrapolate it inwards to 

939
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:11,330
what's called this horizon.
We call it horizon now.

940
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,173
It used to be called the Schwartz at 
singularity and people began to realize 

941
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:16,324
that it wasn't really a singularity.
It's my something you could imagine 

942
00:49:18,431 --> 00:49:19,264
falling through.
I guess it was in the Metro who first 

943
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,920
made clear that clear,
but not many people paid attention.

944
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:28,480
But that was the idea of a black hole.

945
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:29,883
And it looked then is that these quasars
could be having some back hole in the 

946
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:35,524
middle of them.
And I remember John Wheeler who's at 

947
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:41,250
Princeton,
then very distinguished scientist and he

948
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,093
got where you worried about these things
and he talked to me and he were right 

949
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,370
about it.
And do we believe,

950
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:46,770
is there a singularity in the middle of 
the,

951
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,520
we believe Lifshitz and Claton and 
coffee,

952
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,320
they sort of swirl around and bounce 
that.

953
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:55,120
What are we supposed to think?
So I started thinking about this problem

954
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,280
and since that time,
well you see either people,

955
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,320
when he wants to solve the Einstein 
equations,

956
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,250
either you make a lot of assumptions and
it's a symmetrical like,

957
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,093
like the open home is slotted model.
You assume it's got very special 

958
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:12,040
properties and then you can maybe solve 
the equations.

959
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,353
But only very,
very special cases and the computers 

960
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:18,940
weren't powerful enough to tell you very
much about what happened.

961
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,613
So I started thinking about this problem
and realizing that I'd have to think 

962
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:27,070
about it in a different way.
And so I used ideas,

963
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,440
involve ideas from topology and things 
like that to show that there had to be a

964
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:36,320
singularity in the middle,
provided that the collapse had reached a

965
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:41,380
certain point of no return,
I guess to get some idea of,

966
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,490
I dunno,
it's just not too misleading.

967
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,110
There's a mathematical theorem called 
the hairy dog theorem.

968
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,060
Hairy dog pheromones.
Yes.

969
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:53,380
I mean that's just a jocular 
terminology,

970
00:50:53,381 --> 00:50:54,350
right?
But you think of,

971
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:55,203
uh,
something which is topologically a 

972
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:58,810
sphere,
that means you see it,

973
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,673
you imagine a dog shape,
but you could sort of move it around 

974
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,240
with a piece of plasticine until it 
looked like a sphere.

975
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,950
It doesn't have holes in it.
Okay.

976
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:08,780
Forget about his digestive system.
You see,

977
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,830
you're thinking about the surface 
outside and then you're out.

978
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,733
The problem is you're trying to comb the
hair on the dog all the way around and 

979
00:51:15,891 --> 00:51:18,060
the theorem says there's got to be 
somewhere where the hair,

980
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:21,440
it doesn't lie flat and you try it on 
the sphere.

981
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:25,400
There's got to be a point where with the
hair makes a kind of singular point.

982
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,773
So it's a bit like that.
You have no idea where the singularity 

983
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,700
is,
but you know from general,

984
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,540
top logical reasons that there's got to 
be one somewhere.

985
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,660
And that was the sort of argument that I
produced.

986
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,123
And uh,
I guess a lot of people had little bit 

987
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,793
be trouble because they never seen this 
kind of arguing and a lot of people 

988
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:50,620
picked up on it and particular Stephen 
Hawking and uh,

989
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,970
it became for a while,
uh,

990
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,823
many people working on it,
I guess it's not so popular now because 

991
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,940
probably would run out of serums.

992
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:06,430
The idea of a singularity or is when you
see something like a,

993
00:52:07,351 --> 00:52:08,184
a quasar or the,
the the center of a galaxy and we were 

994
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:16,490
talking a lot of black hole.
When you say a singularity,

995
00:52:16,491 --> 00:52:17,324
what?
What exactly are you do you mean by 

996
00:52:19,341 --> 00:52:20,174
that?
Well the normal expectation is that you 

997
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,980
have a place like in the middle of the 
Oppenheimer,

998
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,033
that dust cloud,
that a point there where the density 

999
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,810
becomes infinite and so the curvature of
space time becomes infinite.

1000
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:41,260
So you have a place where the equations 
and run away and they go to infinity and

1001
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:45,950
you say well something's gone wrong.
But maybe initially it was in these very

1002
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,784
symmetrical cases but but you could show
by these indirect arguments that 

1003
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:51,104
somewhere some of these got to go wrong.
You can't continue the equations of 

1004
00:52:55,761 --> 00:52:56,594
Einstein and they got stuck right to the
place where they go infinite or what in 

1005
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:02,450
detail happens.

1006
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,373
The theorems don't tell you,
they just say that something goes wrong 

1007
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,123
and that's what we call the singularity 
and if a black hole is larger or 

1008
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:13,130
smaller,
the singularity remains constant.

1009
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,263
It remains in in there.
It's remains in there but it's not 

1010
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:17,744
measurable in terms of its actual size 
or whether you can measure size very 

1011
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:24,800
well cause its size.
That's an intriguing question.

1012
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,560
You might say the size is going to zero.
Right,

1013
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:30,390
but it could be quite complicated in 
irregular.

1014
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,260
Not like the original opera.
I miss every one of my soldiers.

1015
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,040
Even then the point is the wrong point 
of view but let's not go into that.

1016
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Now there is something about the 
structure of these things.

1017
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:45,790
You can say they're not all the same.
No the singularities and all of sudden,

1018
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,220
but the black holes are not all the 
same.

1019
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,083
They're not all the same but they this,
one of the strange things about black 

1020
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:54,160
holes is that if you let them settle 
down,

1021
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,013
they're not all the same to begin with 
but are not many different things they 

1022
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,430
can settled into.

1023
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,743
They can have rotation,
they can have a certain mass and the 

1024
00:54:03,481 --> 00:54:08,481
mass translates into the size of the 
diameter of the hole and you've also got

1025
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,730
a rotation so they can rotate and these 
are short sweatshirt found.

1026
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:15,564
The non rotating ones and it was roy and
Australia and who first produced a 

1027
00:54:18,941 --> 00:54:22,500
solution for a rotating black hole 
rotating.

1028
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,000
Yes,
a rotating one.

1029
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,450
But then you see the remarkable thing is
that's what they settled down too.

1030
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,613
So there are good theorem this which 
tell you that the general black hole to 

1031
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:31,494
be very complicated,
fairly rapidly will settle down and 

1032
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:37,590
become one of these care solutions.
The rotating black hole.

1033
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,760
I remember when I first saw that 
documentary and I saw the,

1034
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,570
when they were discussing the,
the shape of these galaxies and that the

1035
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:46,404
center of it had this supermassive black
hole that was slowly devouring the 

1036
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:50,963
galaxy.

1037
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:52,803
It is an unbelievably beautiful yet 
simultaneously terrifying idea is that 

1038
00:54:58,591 --> 00:55:03,450
there's this yes,
infinite power in the center of infinite

1039
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:07,560
mass that's absorbing slowly but surely 
everything around it.

1040
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:08,803
But it's not an infinite mass.
The mass is quite well defined and 

1041
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,960
there's not infinite.
But yeah,

1042
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:15,300
I always a good question.
I mean if you wait forever,

1043
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:19,410
how much of the mass actually gets 
swallowed by the black hole?

1044
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:20,940
You see,
I think the,

1045
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:23,610
the pictures to think not just the one 
galaxy but the cluster.

1046
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,353
You see our galaxy has this 4 million 
solar mass black hole and we are on a 

1047
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:32,700
collision course with the Andromeda 
Galaxy.

1048
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,260
And I don't know how long,
but many book some time in the future.

1049
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,310
Yes.
The black holes,

1050
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:41,370
we'll probably spile into each other and
there'll be one big one.

1051
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:42,683
So it's definable mass,
but in infinite density and that this 

1052
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:47,580
point,
which were,

1053
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:48,414
they were speculating that this could 
possibly in the center of the 

1054
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:53,910
supermassive black holes,
if you could go through that,

1055
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,860
there would be another universe.

1056
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,670
Well,
you see that's speculation.

1057
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,900
So nice romantic thought.
Ooh,

1058
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,970
is it more woo,
I'm afraid.

1059
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:05,190
So it's also good though.
Yes,

1060
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:06,024
I know what it's a shame for science 
fiction because it makes a nice thing 

1061
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:09,923
that we try to make things more 
complicated than they are because 

1062
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:16,050
they're so complicated as it is dark 
matter for instance,

1063
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,990
it,
it boggles the mind that we don't really

1064
00:56:18,991 --> 00:56:22,130
totally understand what 90 plus percent.
Well,

1065
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:24,430
that's a good question.
And what does that stuff,

1066
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,890
well,
you want me to tell you my theory?

1067
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,733
Yes,
please.

1068
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,321
Well,
you see,

1069
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:32,920
it's part of a story,
which I don't know,

1070
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:37,280
about 15 years ago,
I must've years of passing back on,

1071
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,270
remember how long ago now?
So I had this idea,

1072
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,213
you see,
the universe as a whole is expanding 

1073
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,620
now,
um,

1074
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,350
early in the this century.
Don't ask me dates again.

1075
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,343
Um,
some people by observing Supernova 

1076
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,390
supernovas saw exposing sauce very,
very far away.

1077
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:06,520
They found out that the university is 
actually accelerating in its expansion.

1078
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,610
And some people found this very 
mysterious.

1079
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,073
On the other hand,
it's in all the cosmology books because 

1080
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:16,900
there is that expectation.
You see,

1081
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:21,100
in 1915,
Einstein produced his general theory.

1082
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,400
In 1917 he introduced what's called the 
cosmological constant.

1083
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,460
So you think of a,
it was called lambda,

1084
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:33,160
you think of a,
a v shape turned upside down,

1085
00:57:33,161 --> 00:57:33,994
which is a member.
And he introduced this term for the 

1086
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:40,060
wrong reason because at that time people
weren't,

1087
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,493
there was some indication in the 
universe was expanding but not very 

1088
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:44,980
clear.
An Einstein,

1089
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,830
uh,
I guess maybe didn't know,

1090
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,210
I didn't believe it.
And this,

1091
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,570
it,
the couples observations hadn't yet come

1092
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:55,450
to make a convincing case of the 
expansion.

1093
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,160
So I saw,
I thought,

1094
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:59,080
well,
maybe the universe is static.

1095
00:57:59,081 --> 00:57:59,914
It's kind of philosophically nice to 
think that it's sitting there all the 

1096
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:02,614
time.

1097
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,580
And he couldn't make it do that.
Uh,

1098
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:07,414
so he had to introduce this term called 
the cosmological constant and he did 

1099
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:16,921
that and then not while very much longer
after this Hobo showed the universe does

1100
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:19,744
seem to be expanding and Einstein 
regarded this lamb the term as his 

1101
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:25,894
biggest blunder,
which is an irony because it turns out 

1102
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,453
that this term is probably the 
explanation for the expansion of the 

1103
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:37,420
universe that we now see.
So it's what people call dark energy.

1104
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:41,320
I don't like the term very much cause 
it's neither dark,

1105
00:58:41,321 --> 00:58:45,280
no proper energy in any clear sense.
But still that was not worry about that.

1106
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,460
It's a,
it's an odd term.

1107
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,570
Yes,
I think so.

1108
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,240
It's a little confusing cause it's dark 
matter as well,

1109
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:53,350
which is quite different.
You know,

1110
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,313
I must be confused with the dark energy 
as it's called of the cosmological 

1111
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,460
constant,
which as far as we can tell,

1112
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:04,120
it is completely consistent with the 
observations.

1113
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,430
It's a positive number,
very small,

1114
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:10,240
but it seems to be producing this 
expansion.

1115
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:15,550
And I'm quite happy with that viewpoint 
because it leads to a picture,

1116
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:18,360
which I've been trying to plug for 
awhile now,

1117
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,100
maybe up to 15 years.
I can't remember.

1118
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,380
Um,
the idea,

1119
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:27,080
I said it's hard to explain,
but let me try.

1120
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,593
It came about because I was worrying 
about the remote future and I was 

1121
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:34,960
thinking,
oh,

1122
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,980
okay.
When these black holes around,

1123
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:39,560
they swallowed up all the stars and 
they're just sitting around.

1124
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,490
And what's the most next exciting thing 
happening?

1125
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:45,200
Well,
the hawking evaporation,

1126
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,063
they're going to radiate away.
Stephen Hawking showed that black holes 

1127
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:51,710
had this temperature extremely cold.
I mean the,

1128
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:52,563
these enormous ones are absurdly cold,
much colder than anything made on the 

1129
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:58,490
earth.
And uh,

1130
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,850
but when the universe expands and 
expands and expands,

1131
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:03,860
it gets colder than the black holes.

1132
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,500
And so those black holes become the 
hottest,

1133
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,560
hottest things around.
And so they radiate away very,

1134
01:00:09,561 --> 01:00:10,394
very slowly.
This hawking radiation and that carries 

1135
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:14,654
energy.
And so they shrink and the shrink and 

1136
01:00:15,891 --> 01:00:18,860
the shrink.
And finally they disappear with a pop.

1137
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,350
I said pop is probably a pretty big 
explosion,

1138
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:25,850
but,
but I'm not that big from a cosmological

1139
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,180
astrophysical scale.
So the disappear,

1140
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,553
well it may have been pretty boring when
you're sitting around waiting for the 

1141
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:35,900
black hole to go pop.
But afterwards that's really boring.

1142
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,063
So this was picture I thought off and 
being rather depressed by it thinking 

1143
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:45,200
that stats are that fate.
You see the faith of all the interesting

1144
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:46,034
things happening.
Ultimate fate is this unbelievably 

1145
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:51,050
boring final state.
Okay,

1146
01:00:51,051 --> 01:00:53,990
this is an emotional argument but it 
gives me a bit of leeway.

1147
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,513
So I began to think,
well it's not going to be us who are 

1148
01:00:58,341 --> 01:00:59,174
going to be bored because we're not 
going to be around the main things that 

1149
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:03,200
will be around.

1150
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,033
We'll be photons and it's pretty hard to
borrow a photon for two very good 

1151
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:10,694
reasons.
One is it probably doesn't have 

1152
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,550
conscious experience,
not about sure.

1153
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,503
So,
but the other is more of the science 

1154
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:20,891
point that they don't measure time cause
the photon has no mass.

1155
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,730
It travels at the speed of light and the
way relativity works,

1156
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:30,731
it means that clocks stop if you like.
So if it had experiences it,

1157
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,483
the moment of its creation would be one 
moment and the next moment would be 

1158
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:35,504
infinity.
And so they're just zip up to infinity 

1159
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:41,960
without noticing thing.
Now she had been doing work on this kind

1160
01:01:41,961 --> 01:01:42,794
of thing,
thinking more about gravitational 

1161
01:01:43,971 --> 01:01:46,460
radiation and how you measure it's 
energy and things like that.

1162
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,190
And it was a very useful picture too.
Squashed down infinity.

1163
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:52,883
A useful thing to think about here,
if you seen these pictures by the Dutch 

1164
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,254
artist Mc Escher,
and there are those which are called 

1165
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:00,614
circle limits and there's a very famous 
one with angels and devils interlocking 

1166
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,740
and they get all crowded up until the 
edge.

1167
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:07,763
They weren't.
You've got to think about is that this 

1168
01:02:08,931 --> 01:02:09,764
is a kind of geometry called hyperbolic 
geometry and the angels and devils live 

1169
01:02:13,821 --> 01:02:17,870
in that geometry and the ones right 
close to the edge think they're the same

1170
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:20,550
size and same shape as the ones in the 
middle.

1171
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:21,350
Oh,
are you good?

1172
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,260
Yeah.
Great.

1173
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,513
Yeah.
And so the idea is that if you look at 

1174
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,510
it from the angels and devils point of 
view,

1175
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,730
that's infinity,
that boundary.

1176
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,013
But from our point of view,
we can look at it and we have what's 

1177
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:40,500
called a conformal map.
That picture is a conformal map,

1178
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,450
but that means is that little shapes are
quite consistently drawn,

1179
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:46,703
but they can be big or small and you 
don't care about whether they're big or 

1180
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:50,694
they're small.
Small shapes are accurate or angles if 

1181
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:55,254
you like her correctly drawn.
So it's what's called a conformal map 

1182
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:01,710
and that can form a map,
describes infinity.

1183
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:05,490
Now you can do the same thing to the 
universe.

1184
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,353
When I say do it,
I mean you can imagine it where this 

1185
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,084
remote future,
you can squash it down just like in the 

1186
01:03:11,881 --> 01:03:16,881
essure picture to a finite boundary.
And as far as the things with no mass,

1187
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:19,950
they don't have a way of measuring how 
big or small it is.

1188
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,720
The maxwell equations don't know the 
scale,

1189
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,010
they don't care.
It's that work just as well for smaller,

1190
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:25,853
so big,
and you can stretch it in someplace and 

1191
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:27,714
squash it somewhere else.
As long as the stretching and squashing 

1192
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:30,594
is isotropic.
So just as much one way as the other 

1193
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:33,414
way,
which means more or less that you keep 

1194
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:36,690
what I go.
The light cones there,

1195
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:37,953
and that's not going to details here,
but it means that that if you have 

1196
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,660
things without mass and most 
particularly the photons,

1197
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,033
then that boundary is just like anywhere
else and the photons goes zipping up to 

1198
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:53,340
it and so you might think they got to 
have somewhere to go,

1199
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,000
okay,
well that's a,

1200
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:58,020
you don't have to think that,
but that was the point of view.

1201
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:01,800
I had the photons need the need 
somewhere to enter it in a way,

1202
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:05,520
but then where does it go?
But then there's the other picture,

1203
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:07,740
which is the opposite.
Then there's the big bang.

1204
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,860
Now you can do a similar sort of trick 
there,

1205
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,593
which is stretching it out and making it
into a boundary and that can be done 

1206
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:17,724
too.
I played around with these ideas for a 

1207
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:23,010
long time and the standard cosmology 
models you can do it with,

1208
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,230
but the more complicated cosmology 
models you might have one,

1209
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:29,940
which is very complicated,
Big Bang.

1210
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,370
The general ones don't look like that at
all,

1211
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,503
so you need to condition which tells you
that the big bang was a very special 

1212
01:04:37,951 --> 01:04:38,784
kind that it was.
It's all tied up with this thing called 

1213
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:41,994
the second law of thermodynamics and 
there's all ties together with physics 

1214
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:46,290
in a way,
which perhaps we don't have time to talk

1215
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:47,124
about,
but it seemed to me a really good idea 

1216
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:52,043
to have the condition on the big bang 
that you could continue it in the same 

1217
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:55,674
way I should say.
The idea of doing this was a former 

1218
01:04:58,171 --> 01:04:59,880
student of mine,
Paul Todd,

1219
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:03,790
who's a colleague of mine and he used 
this continuum,

1220
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:04,653
conform or continuation is,
is a nice way of saying what the 

1221
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:10,500
condition is on the big bang to give you
what you want,

1222
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,190
but that's a huge condition,
but it nevertheless,

1223
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:17,850
it's what starts our universe off in in 
a

1224
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:21,940
very special state,
which is what we live off.

1225
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:22,774
In a way.
It's the second law of thermodynamics 

1226
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:25,710
needs that to get going.
Anyway,

1227
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,790
I don't know if you want to worry about 
that.

1228
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:28,743
But anyway,
the point was that it looks as though 

1229
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:36,361
it's a good condition on the big bang,
but it also should be conformally.

1230
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,350
Uh,
like a boundary,

1231
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,290
which if you had no mass,
you wouldn't notice it.

1232
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,113
Okay.
You've got particles with mass running 

1233
01:05:44,051 --> 01:05:44,884
around near the Big Bang,
but as you get closer and closer and 

1234
01:05:46,871 --> 01:05:49,410
closer to the energy goes up,
the temperature goes zooming,

1235
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:50,283
zooming up these,
zipping around at such a speed that the 

1236
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:57,991
energy of their emotion is much bigger 
than the equals MC squared mass.

1237
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:00,723
Einstein's mass,
the energy in the mass as a certain 

1238
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:08,620
amount,
but when they get so hot,

1239
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:09,603
you can forget about the mass.
So they like photons behave like 

1240
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,330
particles without mass.

1241
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:19,330
And so they're just interested in the 
conformal geometry.

1242
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,793
So the crazy idea I had,
not just only you stretch out the big 

1243
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:26,080
bang,
he squashed on the infinity,

1244
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:31,770
but maybe our big bang was squashed down
infinity of a previous Ian.

1245
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:37,900
So I'm saying our Ian began with a big 
bang,

1246
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:41,050
ended up with this exponential 
expansion.

1247
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:44,530
There was another one before us.
They will be another one astros.

1248
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,600
There was another one before that and so
on.

1249
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,673
So it's an infinite cycle of big banks.
That's the picture and constant 

1250
01:06:50,351 --> 01:06:51,184
expansion to the point where there's no 
more energy and then somehow or another 

1251
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:54,820
a big bang comes out of that.
Yes,

1252
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:55,654
that's right.
Well that's the tricky part that people 

1253
01:06:56,651 --> 01:06:57,484
have trouble.
It's universally accepted that the big 

1254
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:00,184
bang was an event.
There's no pretty well universally 

1255
01:07:02,891 --> 01:07:04,750
theories that are attractive.

1256
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:08,403
I would say nothing terribly popular.
There are certain ideas which say you 

1257
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:16,430
can continue into the before the Big 
Bang Paul Steinhauser,

1258
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,180
what are they thinking?
It's,

1259
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,640
it's,
it has things in common with my model,

1260
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:23,110
but it's not quite the same.
And,

1261
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:26,020
and you see it still is,
he,

1262
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:26,854
there wasn't right not long after 
Einstein produces theory and this 

1263
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:33,963
Alexandra Friedman who was a Russian 
mathematical physicist and he produced 

1264
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:38,050
the first cousin cause mammalogy 
mammals.

1265
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:42,430
And one of these was the one which has 
sort of bounces and big bang.

1266
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:43,264
It expands,
it contracts again and it bounces and 

1267
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:47,020
conduct.
And so that was the one of his models.

1268
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:50,980
The only trouble is if you put 
irregularities into these models,

1269
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,083
you get black holes and these black 
holes component and an incredible mess 

1270
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:55,684
at the end.
And that doesn't join onto a nice 

1271
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:57,670
smooth,
big bang.

1272
01:07:58,170 --> 01:07:58,780
The next one.

1273
01:07:58,780 --> 01:07:59,613
So you have trouble with those models,
but still people take these things 

1274
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:04,490
seriously.
And as I say stanhart and tour,

1275
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,440
I kind of a model which is like that.
So these are the things one has to think

1276
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:11,620
about.
My own view is that they don't take into

1277
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:12,790
account the,
the,

1278
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:15,860
the black hole problem,
which is that,

1279
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:16,694
uh,
my one gets rid of that because the 

1280
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:21,320
black holes or evaporate away by hawking
evaporation.

1281
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,010
And uh,
so it's forms a model.

1282
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:27,320
I used to give talks about this feeling 
quite happy.

1283
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:30,440
Nobody would ever prove it wrong so I 
can go on and talking.

1284
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:33,910
Well that's a no,
I wasn't quite happy with that.

1285
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:36,260
I thought maybe you could see signals 
coming through.

1286
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:39,200
So I had one idea about that,
but more recently,

1287
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:42,200
and this is only just this year,
um,

1288
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,790
I have to polish colleagues,
that's Christoph Meisner and Pav on near

1289
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:48,624
[inaudible].

1290
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:53,770
And there is a Korean who works in New 
York or Daniel an and we,

1291
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:55,424
the four of us have a paper,
which I think today or tomorrow will be 

1292
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:04,400
the new improved version of this paper 
should be on the archive and this,

1293
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:05,563
the title of the paper is,
are we seeing hawking points in the cmb 

1294
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:09,831
sky?
Now,

1295
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:11,660
what's a hawking point?
You see,

1296
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:16,120
I talked about the black holes sitting 
the previous aeon two hours,

1297
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:19,610
assuming it's more or less like ours,
there will be black holes in clusters of

1298
01:09:19,611 --> 01:09:20,510
galaxies.
Huge,

1299
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,344
enormous ones swallowing up,
predict pretty well the whole cluster 

1300
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,900
and what happens to the energy in those 
black holes?

1301
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:27,943
Well,
it goes out in hawking radiation and it 

1302
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:33,020
takes an age,
ages and ages and ages,

1303
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:38,021
maybe 10 to a hundred year,
Google years or something.

1304
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:39,440
Yeah,
ages and ages,

1305
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:44,480
but all that energy in the picture comes
up basically one point.

1306
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,313
Think of that as your picture and right 
at the very edge you see that an awful 

1307
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:49,664
lot of angels and devils squashed 
together there so that the entire 

1308
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:58,250
radiation from that single black hole 
will be squashed into that little point.

1309
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,610
Now where on the other side,
what do we see?

1310
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,833
Well there will be a big release of 
energy at that point and that's what we 

1311
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:09,680
call the hawking point and it spreads 
out.

1312
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:13,010
You see what we see in the cosmic 
microwave background.

1313
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:13,844
This is radiation coming from all 
directions and this radiation doesn't 

1314
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:20,270
come from the big bang.
Exactly.

1315
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,850
It comes from 380,000
years after the big bang.

1316
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:24,684
So there's a sort of last scattering 
surface where the photons which are 

1317
01:10:27,411 --> 01:10:28,244
trying to get out finally,
finally can escape and we see them now 

1318
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:38,770
that spread out from the hawking point 
to what you see and the cosmic microwave

1319
01:10:41,811 --> 01:10:42,644
background in the last scattering 
surface is something of the diameter of 

1320
01:10:46,971 --> 01:10:49,670
about eight times the diameter of the 
moon.

1321
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:52,250
No bigger,
no smaller.

1322
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:56,270
No,
you wouldn't see the whole thing because

1323
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:58,370
our past cone,
where were we?

1324
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,770
What we see is to cut across it.
We don't see the whole thing,

1325
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:01,963
but we see probably most of it.
So you could imagine something from 

1326
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:07,820
about four to eight times the moon's 
diameter,

1327
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:12,440
which is a small region,
which is highly energetic,

1328
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,470
more energetic in the middle.
And it tapers off as you go to the edge.

1329
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,950
And we seem to see these things,
the analysis that,

1330
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,140
um,
that the polls,

1331
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:27,530
they have the techniques and the actual 
analyzing the data.

1332
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:31,830
This is the planck satellite data was 
done by Daniel Lan.

1333
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:33,263
And then we look at the data and we seem
to see an effect which see what you do 

1334
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:39,750
is you,
we've got only one universe.

1335
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:40,584
That's what they're complaining about.
So how do you know if something's real 

1336
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:42,660
or not?

1337
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,493
Whether you make zillions of fake 
universes and you compare this with 

1338
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:48,840
them.
There's a lot of technique about how you

1339
01:11:48,841 --> 01:11:50,400
do this.
But,

1340
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,593
um,
Daniel first did a thousand of these 

1341
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:57,150
fakes and they were sort of two sizes of
these.

1342
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,223
You look at these rings to see whether 
the temperature goes out from the 

1343
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:03,780
outside to the middle.
And there were two sizes,

1344
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:08,400
both within the size of the essay,
about four degrees across the sky.

1345
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:09,803
And um,
there was no evidence of them at all in 

1346
01:12:13,231 --> 01:12:15,450
the simulation.
So this is a real effect.

1347
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,003
Okay.
Then people were skeptical of this for 

1348
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:20,970
one reason or another.
So Daniel did another,

1349
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,650
well,
10,000

1350
01:12:22,651 --> 01:12:23,484
altogether,
and you occasionally the one or two 

1351
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:27,540
which do what,
two or three,

1352
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:28,374
to be precise,
where you see this effect in the 

1353
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:33,240
simulations.
But if you work out the probability that

1354
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:34,074
this is a real effect,
you come up with a confidence level of 

1355
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:40,350
99.98%
that this is a real effect.

1356
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,770
So we're waiting to see what people say 
about this.

1357
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,610
What are your thoughts on multiverses?
Well,

1358
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:48,444
you see,
this is different because this is the 

1359
01:12:50,761 --> 01:12:51,750
what?
Sequential.

1360
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,000
Yeah.
So I don't call it a multiverse.

1361
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:58,290
They each influence the next one.
And so they're not independent worlds.

1362
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,390
Right.
But in the,

1363
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:01,740
the,
the possibility of Independent.

1364
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:03,420
Yeah.
Well,

1365
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:04,254
you see,
there are two reasons for believing 

1366
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:06,594
multiverses.
One of them is the quantum reason that 

1367
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:10,733
maybe we have the shorting this dead and
the livecast they in different worlds 

1368
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:18,300
and they separate universes.
I don't believe that argument.

1369
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:20,640
I don't think that's the right way to 
look at quantum mechanics,

1370
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:21,474
but many people do.
And that suggests that you might have 

1371
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:27,120
these multiple universities and some 
sense on attractive about that to you.

1372
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:31,680
It doesn't explain what we see.
So he wanted a theory which explains the

1373
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:34,050
world we see and the world we see.

1374
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:38,400
You get collapse the state does.
And to explain that,

1375
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:39,234
well it's only because we've drifted off
into some world and another version of 

1376
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:43,464
ourselves as drift into another one and 
some c one and the other side of the 

1377
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:50,901
other and they're all in super position.
It doesn't explain why you see one world

1378
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:54,913
and she has this kind of coherence.
I mean lots of people try and there are 

1379
01:13:59,161 --> 01:14:00,900
many attempts at the sort of thing.
It's,

1380
01:14:00,901 --> 01:14:05,100
it's quite a widely held view and if you
believe quantum mechanics,

1381
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:08,010
the collapse is not real and it doesn't 
happen.

1382
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,413
And all the alternatives,
the dead cats on the cab coexists in 

1383
01:14:12,401 --> 01:14:14,560
different worlds.
That's the interpretation.

1384
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,770
That's a view.
I don't think that I want,

1385
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,530
I want an explanation for the world we 
live in.

1386
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:26,040
And you don't see cast different worlds 
with cats and well it's a long story,

1387
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:27,490
right?

1388
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:28,323
I mean it's clearly,
it's a view you can hold to and if you 

1389
01:14:30,581 --> 01:14:32,110
don't want to monkey with quantum 
mechanics,

1390
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:34,480
it's where you lead.
So that's,

1391
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:36,010
that's right.
That's the alternative.

1392
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:36,873
I,
they don't make a single try to change 

1393
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,053
quantum mechanics at all.
And then you are led to this multi 

1394
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:45,070
world,
many,

1395
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:45,933
many world picture.
I think it even doesn't make that much 

1396
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:51,220
sense.
So you've got to be careful about it.

1397
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:53,480
That whether they are really like 
different,

1398
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,290
distinct worlds,
I don't think it really,

1399
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,870
my view is it doesn't really work,
but let me not try and attack that.

1400
01:14:58,871 --> 01:14:59,704
And I think I have a different view,
which is that the theory is not quite 

1401
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:04,450
quite right.
Right.

1402
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,970
And that,
um,

1403
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:09,820
there is something which makes the 
collapse into a physical process.

1404
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,313
And,
uh,

1405
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,563
the,
there's only one world now the other 

1406
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:19,720
many worlds view,
which is comes from a different reason.

1407
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:24,370
And that is that that seem there seem to
be various accidents,

1408
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:26,350
um,
in,

1409
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:27,363
well maybe one of them being that the 
neutron is just slightly more massive 

1410
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,440
than the Proton.
That's one.

1411
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:33,603
There are lots of other accidents.
We see that if they were a little 

1412
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:38,500
different than life as we know,
it couldn't happen.

1413
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,140
And so how do you explain this?
Well,

1414
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:42,250
some people say,
well,

1415
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:47,280
all these universes with different 
values of these constants all coexist.

1416
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:48,963
It's just we only see the one that we're
in because the numbers come out right 

1417
01:15:52,031 --> 01:15:52,864
for us.
So that's what's called an anthropic 

1418
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,310
argument.
Okay.

1419
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,980
I can see the argument.
I don't like it much.

1420
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,160
It's sort of,
I think we need a better explanation for

1421
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:05,080
why the numbers are what we see and so 
on.

1422
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,920
But that's that that one makes more 
sense to me than the other one.

1423
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,473
So I saw,
I think maybe it has to take that 

1424
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:13,804
seriously,
but it's certainly not the view I'm 

1425
01:16:15,191 --> 01:16:20,191
presenting here with this picture.
It's for someone like me.

1426
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,184
It's so interesting to know that there's
still a considerable amount of 

1427
01:16:23,861 --> 01:16:25,510
speculation.
Yes.

1428
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,940
Oh yeah.
Well it's,

1429
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:30,400
it's,
there's a lot of speculation,

1430
01:16:30,401 --> 01:16:31,234
but a lot of it is pretty off the wall.
And then a lot of people think mine are 

1431
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:38,410
off the wall and see who's to say,
okay,

1432
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,220
I'm,
I'm no man,

1433
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:41,230
no.
And so,

1434
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:43,003
okay.
And I did think in decent things in the 

1435
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:45,424
past,
but you just didn't trust this abuse is 

1436
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,240
nice.
So I guess that's what people think.

1437
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:50,290
I don't know.
But you see,

1438
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:52,000
if it was just me,
I could understand that.

1439
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,523
But I've got these posts and I went an 
Armenian colleague who's done things on 

1440
01:16:57,221 --> 01:16:58,054
this two and a,
it can't be that we all all off the 

1441
01:17:00,551 --> 01:17:02,230
rails I think.
No,

1442
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:04,930
there's something out there.
And now with their talking points,

1443
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:05,764
there's something people can really go 
out and look for and if they don't see 

1444
01:17:08,831 --> 01:17:10,010
you and something funny going on

1445
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,450
somewhere,
if they do see them,

1446
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,160
there's something else going funny on 
which,

1447
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:17,250
which they'll have to think of another 
explanation unless it's my explanation.

1448
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,320
They'll have to think of a different 
view from the current inflation view,

1449
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:24,770
which is in real trouble with these 
observations as far as I can see.

1450
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,800
Do you anticipate in any foreseeable 
time in the future,

1451
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:28,653
uh,
a better understanding of dark matter 

1452
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:34,490
and dark energy or perhaps a better 
definition of what those things are?

1453
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,710
Um,
yeah,

1454
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,810
we see,
I think my,

1455
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,470
my own current view is that dark energy 
as it's called,

1456
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,220
is the cosmological constant.
Now that's a lot of explanation if you'd

1457
01:17:45,221 --> 01:17:46,120
like,
because why is it,

1458
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,233
why is it that the value it has,
why is it they're tall and they're 

1459
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,520
certainly questions about that,
which I agree with.

1460
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,440
Dot.
Matta.

1461
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,910
I didn't go into this,
but in the scheme of mine,

1462
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,260
it has to be there.

1463
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:04,130
When I say it,
I mean that if you want the equations to

1464
01:18:04,131 --> 01:18:04,964
make sense,
which crossover from our remote future 

1465
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:08,923
to the big bang of the next Ian,
you have to have a creation of a 

1466
01:18:13,761 --> 01:18:16,410
dominant new material,
which is scaler.

1467
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:18,410
And as I said,
it doesn't spin.

1468
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:23,440
It's just ordinary particles and that 
they only interact gravitationally.

1469
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:26,053
And that's what we see.
But the theory that I'm putting forward 

1470
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,053
would make these things very massive 
there about what's called the planck 

1471
01:18:34,101 --> 01:18:34,934
mass.
I don't know exactly cause there's some 

1472
01:18:36,141 --> 01:18:38,960
freedom in this.
Something like the prank planck mass,

1473
01:18:38,961 --> 01:18:42,740
which people describe as the massive of 
fleas.

1474
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,633
I don't quite know why they make it,
but that's about 10 to the minus five 

1475
01:18:48,471 --> 01:18:49,304
grams.
So you're looking at the 100000th of a 

1476
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:56,660
gram.
So it's sort of an appreciable size.

1477
01:18:56,661 --> 01:18:59,900
It's not,
it's not like basic particles in physics

1478
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:00,620
measurable.

1479
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,453
It's the sort of measurable thing you 
could imagine you could get that get 

1480
01:19:04,521 --> 01:19:05,354
hold of in some way,
but that's huge for for a fundamental 

1481
01:19:08,361 --> 01:19:10,160
particle.
So it's a,

1482
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:12,140
it's a wild idea from that point of 
view.

1483
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:17,240
But also they should decay and they 
should decay into gravitational signals,

1484
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:20,600
which may be,
could be seen by Lego,

1485
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:21,943
maybe have been seen by lego and thrown 
in the rubbish bin because they'd be 

1486
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:30,080
different types of signals from what 
people would expect.

1487
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,320
I wouldn't like to put my money anywhere
there,

1488
01:19:33,321 --> 01:19:34,154
but I'm lacking hoping that these dark 
matter particles are the ones that come 

1489
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:42,080
from the theory that,
that I'm putting forward.

1490
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,090
So that will be another consequence of 
this particular point of view.

1491
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:49,640
And they've observed,
correct me if I'm wrong,

1492
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:53,270
entire galaxies that they believe are 
the consist of dark matter.

1493
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,300
There is Liz,
let me see if I remember what it is.

1494
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,330
There's some galaxies the other way 
around,

1495
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,550
which don't seem to have any dark 
matter.

1496
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,850
There are other galaxies which have huge
amounts.

1497
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,350
That's probably what you're referring 
to,

1498
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:08,090
whether they were only dot.
Imagine

1499
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:10,370
you'd have trouble seeing them.
Right because dot.

1500
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,690
Mazur off til he,
it was just a measured thing.

1501
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:15,090
It may be,
I don't know that one.

1502
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:17,280
It's quite possible.
Yeah,

1503
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:20,350
I don't see why not.
Um,

1504
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,210
they just have to have some reason why 
they clump together in this way.

1505
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:28,320
You see it's quite possible if galaxies 
collide,

1506
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,310
then when you see the stars tend to go 
through,

1507
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:35,070
so they would accompany with they'd 
company the dark matter,

1508
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,600
the dust and the galaxies tends to get 
stuck and stay where it is.

1509
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,434
So if two collide,
then you'd have a big pile of dust in 

1510
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:43,374
the middle.
But I think the dark matter tends to 

1511
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:49,300
carry on through with the stars.
I don't know.

1512
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:53,460
There may be some process which could 
produce just islands of dark matter.

1513
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:54,390
I don't know.

1514
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,793
When you discussed the cosmos,
maybe the single most intriguing 

1515
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:03,291
possibility to us as human beings is 
what other intelligent life,

1516
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:06,270
if any,
is out there.

1517
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:07,104
And how interesting is that to you 
because you spent so much time studying 

1518
01:21:10,801 --> 01:21:13,560
the fundamental particles of the 
universe itself.

1519
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,693
How interested are you in the 
possibility of other intelligent life 

1520
01:21:18,661 --> 01:21:23,010
forms or have you just like put that out
into the,

1521
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:23,844
it's just so ridiculously unlikely or so
far away from us that we're probably 

1522
01:21:28,621 --> 01:21:29,580
never going to make contact.

1523
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:30,563
Where do you see it's not?
So there's this Seti program looking at 

1524
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,860
to see where they can see signals from 
listening to civilizations.

1525
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:42,990
The problem there from my perspective is
that although they might be out there,

1526
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:47,340
they've got to have had a real headstart
on us before he would see them.

1527
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:51,140
They might have done so.
But then I dunno,

1528
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,610
you see actually via,
he goes to John,

1529
01:21:53,611 --> 01:21:58,611
who's my Armenian colleague and who 
looked also for these ring shaped things

1530
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:01,890
and looked at them in a different way 
from the Polish people.

1531
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:05,190
But um,
we seem to have seen something there.

1532
01:22:05,191 --> 01:22:06,024
But we wrote a paper in which we 
speculated on beings from the previous 

1533
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:11,904
Ian communicating with us.
And the advantage there is that you're 

1534
01:22:16,501 --> 01:22:18,790
looking at the really advanced 
civilizations,

1535
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,580
really the,
you see

1536
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:21,673
billions of years ago that they,
their universe disappeared and then had 

1537
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:32,330
to come back to a big bank statements 
and those could come through and somehow

1538
01:22:32,331 --> 01:22:34,730
or another,
those signals Romaine.

1539
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,440
It's conceivable.
I agree.

1540
01:22:36,441 --> 01:22:38,330
It's pretty far fetched,
but you know,

1541
01:22:38,331 --> 01:22:39,710
who knows what.
So Ian's,

1542
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:41,840
how many billions of years are you 
talking about?

1543
01:22:41,841 --> 01:22:43,280
Like the,
the big bang.

1544
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:45,050
14 billion.

1545
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,390
Yes.
But you see that's way,

1546
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,960
way at the beginning in a sense or at 
three quarters of the way through.

1547
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:52,794
In another sense it depends on how you 
draw the picture in the sense of 

1548
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:58,800
interestingness or

1549
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:03,490
formal picture.
We are already three quarters of the way

1550
01:23:03,491 --> 01:23:05,800
through.
So 14 billion now.

1551
01:23:05,801 --> 01:23:06,730
So we have

1552
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:07,753
how much content does he is you see the 
trouble is it's this a cheat to cheat 

1553
01:23:11,630 --> 01:23:14,660
the year count.
It's as much as you like.

1554
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:15,494
It depends on the on on something else.
The mass has to feed out and how you 

1555
01:23:19,851 --> 01:23:24,851
measure the time it becomes problematic 
and it's either infinity you see,

1556
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:30,251
which isn't much use or you might have 
different definitions of time,

1557
01:23:30,741 --> 01:23:31,574
which depends on what particle you're 
using as your clocks and things like 

1558
01:23:33,531 --> 01:23:33,840
that.

1559
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,673
So are you essentially saying that it's 
entirely possible that we are the 

1560
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:42,810
furthest in terms of our technological 
achievement and our understanding of the

1561
01:23:42,811 --> 01:23:45,780
universe itself?
It's possible that we're at the front of

1562
01:23:45,781 --> 01:23:46,614
the line though there might be some 
other intelligent life forms in the 

1563
01:23:48,631 --> 01:23:50,940
universe,
but they might be behind us.

1564
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,330
Well there would have been,
I mean,

1565
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,920
I'm not saying they got through,
you say,

1566
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,800
well maybe they have techniques for 
getting through,

1567
01:23:56,801 --> 01:23:58,840
but that's,
that's a bit hard to imagine.

1568
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:00,160
But,
um,

1569
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,490
maybe information from them,
mcgee it through and maybe you mean from

1570
01:24:03,491 --> 01:24:04,680
the previous els?
Yes.

1571
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,600
They might have got through like somehow
or another survived.

1572
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,583
Yes.
But it would have to be in the form of 

1573
01:24:10,181 --> 01:24:11,790
photons or something.
The,

1574
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:12,910
I know you could,
it's not,

1575
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:15,290
I'm talking about ridiculous 
speculators.

1576
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,740
Sure.
In coding information.

1577
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,000
The photons.
Yes.

1578
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:19,893
Yes.
Wow.

1579
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:21,003
It's conceivable.
I don't want to say that I see it 

1580
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:24,424
happening or anything,
but it's not out of the question that 

1581
01:24:26,531 --> 01:24:31,180
they could develop some technology which
would get information,

1582
01:24:31,181 --> 01:24:34,790
which might be them in some sense,
uh,

1583
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,430
across,
in the form of photons.

1584
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:37,483
But you're not optimistic about current 
intelligent life somewhere in the 

1585
01:24:40,011 --> 01:24:40,844
universe.

1586
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,990
Not too optimistic.
Just because,

1587
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,430
um,
well maybe it took us a long time to get

1588
01:24:48,431 --> 01:24:52,240
going because the dinosaurs were there 
for a while and somebody might've got in

1589
01:24:52,241 --> 01:24:53,074
there earlier and they're different 
planets and they could've got there 

1590
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:57,070
quite ahead of us.
It's,

1591
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,050
it's conceivable.
I'm not going to rule it out.

1592
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,740
I just not terribly optimistic about it.
No,

1593
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:04,720
I think it's worth doing.
It's worth looking.

1594
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:05,943
Yes,
but it's not something that you're 

1595
01:25:06,391 --> 01:25:08,090
really not servicing.
I'm expecting.

1596
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,000
It's not so much.
I be curious.

1597
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:10,834
Certainly then I'm not expecting it.
I guess is it just because of the 

1598
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:14,134
overall lack of real evidence and it's 
just not an attractive thing for you to 

1599
01:25:20,561 --> 01:25:22,150
pursue?
It's quite attractive.

1600
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,290
It's short.
You know?

1601
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,293
I've just been doing other things and I 
don't know there's enough to do in the 

1602
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:33,241
world.
I haven't really come to terms that very

1603
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:35,800
hugely.

1604
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:39,700
So I know there's this activity and I,
I'd be interested to see if any kind of,

1605
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:40,653
you know,
if this,

1606
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:45,250
there was this thing that came past that
some people speculated was sent there by

1607
01:25:45,251 --> 01:25:46,084
and different intelligence,
which came quite close in our solar 

1608
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:50,771
system.
Oh,

1609
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:53,380
that was that strange looking.
This trailer shaved.

1610
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,233
Yes,
that's right.

1611
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:55,121
Yeah.
I mean,

1612
01:25:55,121 --> 01:25:59,380
I don't see any real reason to believe 
it's alien supposedly because of the way

1613
01:25:59,381 --> 01:26:02,660
it was traveling though was the idea or 
something.

1614
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:05,390
I really serious about it.
See what these people did suggest.

1615
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:08,750
It might be something sent by an alien 
civilization.

1616
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:13,640
So it's worth you if one could make 
connect with it in some way.

1617
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:16,910
But I don't know,
I guess it's too far away now.

1618
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:20,150
He wants another thing that's so 
uniquely fascinating for us.

1619
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:23,240
The concept of sale of another of 
another life form out there.

1620
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,550
Oh sure.
Yes.

1621
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,513
Yeah.
No you see there are lots of things I'm 

1622
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:29,743
interested in the ones I talked to you 
about and perhaps some of the main 

1623
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:33,863
months.
Although the consciousness one is I'm 

1624
01:26:36,171 --> 01:26:40,970
glad that there are people doing it and 
you see this is one of the things,

1625
01:26:40,971 --> 01:26:45,971
there's this institute that's that's 
being created using my name and uh,

1626
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:51,730
James Tag is involved with this,
started it and I was quite,

1627
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,970
I'm not admitting them,
worried about having my name attached to

1628
01:26:55,971 --> 01:26:57,440
this thing when I didn't know much about
it.

1629
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:58,483
But it seems to me a really important 
thing where you can deliberate purpose 

1630
01:27:04,521 --> 01:27:09,521
of it is to develop ideas which are make
sense but are not mainstream.

1631
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:13,460
And one of these was the consciousness 
thing.

1632
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,540
So,
you know,

1633
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:15,374
Stuart Hameroff is doing it,
but it's not a activity that's being 

1634
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,680
taken pot people researching it in,
in detail in other parts of the world.

1635
01:27:25,190 --> 01:27:26,023
So to have a place which supports that 
kind of thing is great and I think 

1636
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:33,170
that's very good.
But when I heard about it at first,

1637
01:27:33,171 --> 01:27:34,100
I thought,
well,

1638
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:38,840
most of my interests are on the physics 
side and not so much in biology,

1639
01:27:38,841 --> 01:27:39,674
which I'm pretty ignorant about.
And there are lots of ideas on that 

1640
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:44,900
side,
not just the cosmology,

1641
01:27:44,901 --> 01:27:45,734
but ideas and building experiments which
might detect the collapse of the wave 

1642
01:27:52,941 --> 01:27:53,774
function.
And one idea to look at Bose-einstein 

1643
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:57,343
condensates said,
I have a colleague that's Yvette 

1644
01:27:59,301 --> 01:28:04,301
[inaudible] who I knew about and who had
these ideas of how to use,

1645
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:06,283
um,
Bose-einstein condensates to detect 

1646
01:28:09,591 --> 01:28:11,930
gravitational waves.
And that's also very,

1647
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,420
you know,
not a mainstream way of looking at it,

1648
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,433
but a very clever idea.
And the Bose-einstein condensates 

1649
01:28:18,891 --> 01:28:21,650
because that's so quantum mechanical and
they're so cold,

1650
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:22,484
they're almost virtually absolute zero.
And they can keep external disturbances 

1651
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,513
from causing problems and you can 
manipulate them in ways to make them in 

1652
01:28:35,841 --> 01:28:36,860
two places at once.

1653
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,753
People have done this kind of thing.
And so it might well be a good way of 

1654
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:42,860
testing the one,
the Schrodinger cat thing.

1655
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:44,530
And we went,
uh,

1656
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:49,070
whether the state reduction or the 
collapse of way function is a phenomenon

1657
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:54,350
in which is kind,
which I hope might be like gravitational

1658
01:28:54,441 --> 01:28:56,320
effect.
And in,

1659
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:57,650
in that case,
if it is,

1660
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:59,750
then that will be relevant to the 
consciousness problem.

1661
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,490
So all these things tied in various 
ways.

1662
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:05,280
And so the hope was that these things,
which are,

1663
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:07,020
um,
you know,

1664
01:29:07,021 --> 01:29:07,854
could be supported.
And I thought it was important because 

1665
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:13,980
there's always the danger of such an 
institute being regarded as flaky,

1666
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:16,560
but he's doing weird things.
Who Cares?

1667
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:17,903
So the important point from my 
perspective is that they should be 

1668
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:21,323
things which can me and either now 
immediately tested experimentally or 

1669
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:30,870
when a few years.
So that things which are really,

1670
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:31,793
you can get your hotel,
you can get and test them and see 

1671
01:29:33,811 --> 01:29:34,740
whether they're right or not.

1672
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,940
So this would be a protection against 
thinking of,

1673
01:29:37,941 --> 01:29:38,774
well these,
these crazy ideas that are being 

1674
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:40,914
pursued,
they have to be ideas which are capable 

1675
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:46,740
of tests and have a reasonable chance 
of,

1676
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:47,603
of,
of showing evidence in favor in their 

1677
01:29:50,431 --> 01:29:51,570
favor or against,
you know,

1678
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:55,020
whichever would be interesting and 
important to know.

1679
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:56,063
So from the outside looking in,
to me it's so fascinating to watch 

1680
01:29:59,130 --> 01:29:59,963
intellectuals as a,
like yourself that are bouncing these 

1681
01:30:03,391 --> 01:30:06,210
ideas around that are possible but are 
not mainstream.

1682
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:10,110
And it seems to me that it's a 
precarious sort of tight rope walk.

1683
01:30:10,111 --> 01:30:13,410
Like you don't want to say anything 
ridiculous that's not true.

1684
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,463
So he would love to say something that 
seems to be ridiculous but turns out to 

1685
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:21,210
be in fact accurate and provable.
And so that was this dance.

1686
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,860
I absolutely agree.
Yes,

1687
01:30:22,861 --> 01:30:23,694
that's absolutely right.
And of course you've got to play with 

1688
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,800
ideas which are on the sort of edge of 
what we know otherwise you're stuck with

1689
01:30:30,991 --> 01:30:31,824
what we know.

1690
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:36,110
And these things will simply get 
channeled down the old roots and,

1691
01:30:36,111 --> 01:30:37,850
and you,
you need to be able to break,

1692
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:40,290
break free of those from time to time,
but not in a,

1693
01:30:40,291 --> 01:30:45,270
in a way which is too crazy to be 
examined.

1694
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,133
See whether there's truth in these ideas
are not because of the synchronization 

1695
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:52,650
that people have to go towards Wu or 
towards crazy ideas.

1696
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,870
It is important for the skepticism.
Right.

1697
01:30:54,871 --> 01:30:57,000
And it is important for the scrutiny.
Yes.

1698
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,860
Oh absolutely.
So there's real,

1699
01:30:58,861 --> 01:31:01,530
it was real danger in that ledge.
I agree.

1700
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:02,423
Well you see this is a strange kind of 
problem you see because with these 

1701
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:08,130
observations,
I'm not about,

1702
01:31:08,131 --> 01:31:09,820
they're hawking points which I was 
describing,

1703
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,460
but the earlier ones about black hole 
collisions and my Armenian colleague and

1704
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:15,294
I had written a couple of papers on this
and we hadn't gotten any response at 

1705
01:31:19,531 --> 01:31:20,364
all.

1706
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,460
And the Polish people and they'd written
papers,

1707
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:26,460
two of them accepted by respectable 
journals.

1708
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:30,810
And I'm Chris,
I've asked me,

1709
01:31:30,811 --> 01:31:32,520
you know,
what kind of responses you got and I say

1710
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:34,290
zero.
And so I see him.

1711
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:37,200
What about you?
How about what people respond to zero.

1712
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:39,600
So this is kind of spooky.
You see,

1713
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,880
we've got these things out there in the 
literature,

1714
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,313
refereed a accepted publications and 
instead of people saying this is a load 

1715
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:49,051
of nonsense,
look,

1716
01:31:49,051 --> 01:31:49,884
it doesn't make any sense for this 
reason and this disagrees with this 

1717
01:31:51,721 --> 01:31:53,610
observation and so,
and that was fine.

1718
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:56,190
If I see that,
I might be unhappy with it,

1719
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:58,680
but you've got something to work on and 
you say,

1720
01:31:58,710 --> 01:31:59,800
oh,
I see what's wrong.

1721
01:31:59,801 --> 01:32:01,540
Something needs modifying here.
Ah,

1722
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:04,780
that doesn't explain properly.
That's what's needed or yes,

1723
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:05,191
no,
you're,

1724
01:32:05,191 --> 01:32:07,300
you're right.
I had been abandoned this idea.

1725
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:08,493
All of these things come from criticisms
and to have absolutely no tension 

1726
01:32:13,271 --> 01:32:17,500
whatsoever paid to these papers.
Something I find spooky.

1727
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:19,990
Why do you think there's no attention 
paid?

1728
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:23,800
I don't know.
I don't really know.

1729
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:26,103
I mean one of the things is there's so 
much information and that people don't 

1730
01:32:29,981 --> 01:32:30,814
have time.
They've grown their own projects and 

1731
01:32:32,141 --> 01:32:32,974
they didn't want to pay attention and 
they think it looks crazy because it's 

1732
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:41,200
too much outside the picture of the 
world that they have.

1733
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:45,940
And I think a lot of it's that and they 
maybe say,

1734
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:47,360
well look,
I've been thinking,

1735
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:48,194
you know,
I'm an old guy now and I maybe I did 

1736
01:32:50,651 --> 01:32:53,000
good things in the past,
but um,

1737
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:54,970
maybe I've gone a bit off the rails,
but I think that,

1738
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:55,960
you know,
I've got colleagues,

1739
01:32:56,110 --> 01:33:00,280
it's not just me and these respect to 
people who work on these things too.

1740
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,490
So I don't think that can be a complete 
explanation.

1741
01:33:03,491 --> 01:33:04,390
Maybe it's part of it.

1742
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:05,583
Well,
the sheer volume of papers that are 

1743
01:33:06,401 --> 01:33:07,234
published,
it's got to be impossible to keep up 

1744
01:33:08,561 --> 01:33:09,050
with all that.

1745
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:12,680
I think that's a big part of the trouble
because there are other ideas which,

1746
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:16,540
which to me look crazy and do other 
people don't look in ears.

1747
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:17,443
And as crazy as my idea as you see.
So maybe that's why there's a lot of 

1748
01:33:21,021 --> 01:33:23,270
them have more attention page than the 
ones we,

1749
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:24,183
I actually,
I'm curious to know whether the hawking 

1750
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,230
points we'll take off or not.

1751
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:28,453
Well,
I'm so happy there's people like you 

1752
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:30,793
doing this kind of work.
And then someone condensing it down to 

1753
01:33:33,501 --> 01:33:38,501
an understandable point that someone 
like me can absorb and just tried to get

1754
01:33:39,351 --> 01:33:43,360
a better picture of this insane reality 
that we're living in.

1755
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:44,793
But it is pretty weird subsidies.
And it seems like the more I talked to 

1756
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:52,130
people like yourself and the more you 
study this,

1757
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:55,460
it doesn't get less weird.
It gets more weird.

1758
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,170
Yes.
I think that's right.

1759
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,420
Well,
I don't know more information.

1760
01:33:59,421 --> 01:34:00,254
It seems to be more fantastic.
There's suddenly a lot of very weird 

1761
01:34:03,201 --> 01:34:03,860
things,

1762
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:07,850
but the point about them is that they 
got to make sense,

1763
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:12,080
mathematical sense.
They've got agree with observation facts

1764
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:15,680
and that rules out.
A lot of the really weird ones

1765
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:17,173
does.
But even the ones that are observable 

1766
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:23,410
and do adhere to the facts,
they're so fantastic.

1767
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,160
It's so the,
the reality,

1768
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:26,003
this is one of the things that's most 
frustrating about people's inclination 

1769
01:34:29,471 --> 01:34:30,304
to lean towards the Wu and I,
I've been guilty of it myself and so 

1770
01:34:33,611 --> 01:34:34,444
attractive.
But what's frustrating about it is that 

1771
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:41,050
provable reality is so titanic Lee,
bizarre.

1772
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,100
That's true.
No,

1773
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:43,953
I agree that it's almost like why bother
with the woo reality is you can make a 

1774
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:51,820
good point in and of itself.
You're absolutely right.

1775
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,080
No,
it's very,

1776
01:34:53,081 --> 01:34:53,680
very strange.
Strange

1777
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:57,710
in quantum mechanics in so many ways is,
but you see you got to,

1778
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:03,430
I think there's a little bit of a danger
of separating the things which are,

1779
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,740
well first of all,
it can be just wrong.

1780
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:07,933
Secondly,
there are things which do require 

1781
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,153
quantum mechanics to be changed in some 
way and there'd be other ones which are 

1782
01:35:13,461 --> 01:35:17,510
within quantum mechanics are just weird 
and that's absolutely true.

1783
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:19,183
There are these things which,
which I believe have to be true as much 

1784
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:25,580
as the Dib died in the womb.
Quantum mechanics,

1785
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:28,700
people who follow the party lines and so
on.

1786
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:32,000
Yeah,
I mean these quantum entanglements,

1787
01:35:32,001 --> 01:35:35,420
the fact that things can be whatever it 
is,

1788
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:36,633
a couple of thousand kilometers 
separated and yet know each other and a 

1789
01:35:41,391 --> 01:35:42,224
way.
You can't explain that there are 

1790
01:35:44,541 --> 01:35:49,541
separate individuals.
They behave as though they're one called

1791
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:51,483
the and tangled state.
And you can make experiments which 

1792
01:35:54,651 --> 01:35:56,740
revealed that,
I mean,

1793
01:35:56,741 --> 01:35:57,574
it's was a John Bell who is an Irish 
theoretical physicists who really made 

1794
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:04,670
it,
made all this very clear.

1795
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
These things are real manifestations of 
the peculiarity of quantum mechanics and

1796
01:36:10,251 --> 01:36:11,450
really out there in the world.

1797
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:13,723
Was it jbs Haldane it said,
the world is not only queer than you 

1798
01:36:16,281 --> 01:36:18,150
suppose it's queer.
Then you can suppose,

1799
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:21,410
all right,
that's what this is,

1800
01:36:21,411 --> 01:36:22,460
right?
Indeed,

1801
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:23,720
yes.
This is that kind of thing.

1802
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:24,530
Well,
listen sir,

1803
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:26,480
thank you for your time.
I really appreciate it.

1804
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:29,720
I really appreciate talking to you and 
thank you for all your work and your,

1805
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:35,290
your contribution to our understanding 
of what we're looking at here.

1806
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,900
What I hope it helps a bit,
but it helps a lot.

1807
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:40,310
I appreciate you very much.
Thank you.

1808
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:41,263
Thank you,
sir.

1809
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:49,163
Hm.
