1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,960
Remember growing pains my own before Kirk
Cameron became one of the most awesome

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,170
lovers.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,970
Why is it banana shaped the way it is?

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,740
I never told you to explain that shit.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,011
Joe.

7
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:16,011
I actually was on a plane with Kirk
Cameron recently and he was just sitting

8
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:20,430
there looking so sad and depressed and I,

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,960
cause it was one of those things where uh,

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,080
I was waiting for somebody else to put
like their luggage up so I was just

11
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:28,050
standing right next to him and he's
just sitting there like looking at his

12
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:28,501
phone,

13
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,970
like looking past his phone,

14
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:33,630
not even looking what's on the screen
and he just sat there and then like some

15
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,300
woman came up to him and he just looked
up and went like did those are like

16
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,600
little smile but it was so weird being

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,470
to wouldn't,

18
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,470
you can imagine every day the guy is
fighting off the gay with every fiber of

19
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:46,084
his being.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,100
He is just clenching his teeth and finding
out if you really want to save Kirk

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,130
Cameron,

22
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:51,791
this is what you do.

23
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,930
If you're a big gay guy,

24
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,860
sit in his lap and pull your
cock out and he'll just,

25
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,320
he'll suck on it like a baby
to its mother's breasts.

26
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:01,720
Banana peel on that first security.

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,630
That's what he's doing.

28
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,890
He's just fighting off the gay
tooth and nail and claw and Fang.

29
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,300
So funny to me how the not people who
are most outspoken against homosexuality

30
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,123
gaze.

31
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:15,851
Look at him.

32
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:17,260
He's so obviously gay.

33
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,450
You can't get any
obviously gayer than Kirk.

34
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:22,020
Cameron not does anything wrong
with being obviously either.

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,800
I mean for the guy to be happy,

36
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,000
she just come out of the closet.

37
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,620
All of them just come out.

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,030
What do you think about the Tom Cruise?

39
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:29,650
A Scientology,

40
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,990
Surrey or whatever and that whole thing.

41
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,781
It's amazing.

42
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:36,380
The Tom Cruise already has
a new Ukrainian beauty,

43
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,090
fantastic picture of him and her holding
hands are ready in a magazine like a

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,430
such an obviously stage picture.

45
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,390
You're like Scientology
are bad motherfuckers cause
they're still rocking it.

46
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:50,270
Old School in 2012 all right.

47
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,310
They're putting together storylines,

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,140
they're creating like narratives.

49
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,210
They have like a whole fucking publicity.

50
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:57,140
So like,

51
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,880
like whole area.

52
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,270
A department that like figures
out how to handle it when you Tom,

53
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:04,040
my girlfriend and we
need Tom girlfriend know,

54
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:04,521
right?

55
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:05,540
It's like an a newsroom.

56
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,231
Like that's it.

57
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:06,351
They're,

58
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:06,700
they're the,

59
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,120
the like the News Corp,

60
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,890
but we spotted Caney holds New
York step pitches in New York.

61
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,753
Shit,

62
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,030
we need Tom with a hot Russian right.

63
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,840
Right now.

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,531
And Tom.

65
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:16,771
Okay.

66
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,650
You're going to go on Ellen this time and
jump on the couch and you're gonna say

67
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:20,590
you're in love and you're in.

68
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,570
I don't care if you're 15 if
you want to fix your career,

69
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,520
jump on that woman's couch.

70
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,590
All things Seaton

71
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,860
the,

72
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,310
the videos of them,

73
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,270
like people trying to go
into their welcome to the
public kind of festivals and

74
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,730
them coming out and aggressively
swarming around people and screaming,

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
what's your issue?

76
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:38,381
What's your problem?

77
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:38,891
What are you hiding?

78
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:39,724
What are you afraid of?

79
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,091
It's,

80
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:40,391
that's,

81
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:41,230
that's scary shit.

82
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,500
They love the company of Bigot too.

83
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,363
That's like a big one.

84
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,770
They call people bigots.

85
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,760
Beg It.

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,593
You're a bigot.

87
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,540
Yeah.

88
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,210
Scientology's fascinating
organization to me.

89
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,340
And just let the dogs help people though,

90
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:52,820
man.

91
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,600
No doubt about,

92
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,690
I have a neighbor who was a scientologist
who's out in Nice fucking guy,

93
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:56,961
man.

94
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,070
He's a great guy.

95
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,660
And he,

96
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,620
it helped man.

97
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,770
Hey Dude tells you all the great things
that he did for him and how it helped

98
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,251
his business,

99
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:07,360
helped his life and helped us focus and
this and that and fucking believes in

100
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,194
it.

101
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,970
Who are you tell them differently?

102
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,781
Kevin Pereira.

103
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm nobody.

104
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,891
I'm nobody.

105
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,724
Joe Rogan.

106
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,750
Do you think,

107
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:14,500
um,

108
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,820
how much of a Tom Cruise's life
is surrounded by Scientologists?

109
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:19,391
Is he just like,

110
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:19,870
you know,

111
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,140
uh,

112
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,470
uh,

113
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,230
Scientology

114
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,930
by God [inaudible] he goes,

115
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,400
yeah,

116
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,920
I think,

117
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,501
is he the head guy?

118
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,750
He wears the pig helmet at the meeting.

119
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,261
You know,

120
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:29,990
like he's the one that's like
the deepest in and I think,

121
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:33,680
I think there's like a group of like
probably like six main players and he's

122
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,330
like the one in the head guys,

123
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,164
you know,

124
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,050
it's,

125
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,780
I like that you've just created
your own fucking council of dude.

126
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,160
Right?

127
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,611
Seriously.

128
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,221
He's in a meeting,

129
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,300
they're hollowed out volcano.

130
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,260
Ever seen the video?

131
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,300
The staff were full.

132
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,070
He's like one of the
most powerful guys ever.

133
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:46,580
It is,

134
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,280
can you pull up

135
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,380
the video of him in the,

136
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:52,550
do you know the Scientology
video where he is a,

137
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,120
it's a video that wasn't supposed to get,

138
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,980
it was like supposed to play it
like a conference or something.

139
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:56,161
Right.

140
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,120
And it was supposed to be in the,

141
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:57,600
yeah.

142
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,610
I don't know what you
would said Tom Cruise.

143
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:00,391
Creepy speech.

144
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:01,230
Scientology,

145
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,191
but whatever it is,

146
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:02,341
they,

147
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:03,360
they had it set up.

148
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,501
Excuse me.

149
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:05,760
They had it set up in this,

150
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:06,594
um,

151
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,703
like a hole.

152
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,620
There was like a whole auditorium of
people that were like watching this tape,

153
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:10,851
right,

154
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,100
wasn't it?

155
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,330
Yeah.

156
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,560
Yeah.

157
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,250
And like cheering along
with it and shed him.

158
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,123
Am I remembering that right?

159
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,441
No,

160
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,000
I think it wasn't any,

161
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,120
it was like an annual meeting,

162
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:16,954
like a seminar.

163
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,330
Like you sit through that and then they
offer you a time share and then you get

164
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,164
to go skiing.

165
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,950
Poor Katie Holmes,

166
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,080
poor Jason.

167
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,830
But didn't she sign up?

168
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,521
Like I've always heard,

169
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:25,281
I've always heard,

170
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:25,471
hey,

171
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,900
sign up.

172
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,681
Sign up for it.

173
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:26,861
Yeah.

174
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,460
And it's like when you get
this much money and sure.

175
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,180
Monitor career to come back.

176
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,460
I just wanted to be relevant,

177
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,353
you know,

178
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,410
and guess what man,

179
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,630
that's the only way to do
it for a lot of these girls,

180
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,340
you know all these middling girls,

181
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,941
you know,

182
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,580
they're doing pretty good there.

183
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,401
Okay.

184
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:42,851
And you know,

185
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:47,851
five years goes by and she's
39 ou pass and that's it.

186
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,264
It's over.

187
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:49,510
Yeah.

188
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,380
So you've got to make a,

189
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:54,710
you got to bust a move before your
fucking rice runs out of the stock.

190
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,050
It sand out of the thing

191
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,640
San out of the hourglass
or the that thing.

192
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,830
The old rice bucket.

193
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,893
Right.

194
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,220
What did I feel like there's
a similar measuring devices,

195
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,460
rice and some cultures.

196
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,690
Yeah,

197
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,950
look at them all clapping.

198
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:09,784
He's got a metal,

199
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,923
he did it.

200
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,630
It's got a metal to metal heat.

201
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,431
One the religion.

202
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:13,990
I've never been

203
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,900
met a more competent
the world or background.

204
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,690
Podium tolerant,

205
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,820
more compassionate being outside of what
I've experienced from LRH and I've met

206
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,550
the leaders of leaders.

207
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,810
Okay.

208
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,770
I've met them all.

209
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,611
So I say to you,

210
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:33,821
sir,

211
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,301
cob,

212
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,680
we are lucky to have you and thank you.

213
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,583
Beautiful.

214
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,970
He's beautiful.

215
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,890
Was an l Ron busted on like a boat in
international waters having sex with

216
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:48,670
underage people.

217
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,180
Yup.

218
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,510
Okay.

219
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,770
Something,

220
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,530
well maybe not.

221
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,363
I just put I said yeah,

222
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,250
what made it so there
we go update the Wiki.

223
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,560
Can we just get that and
that's not even the man.

224
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:57,800
Um,

225
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,040
there's

226
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,990
one where he's appearing by tape,

227
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:00,171
right?

228
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:00,470
Yeah.

229
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:00,711
Yeah.

230
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:03,470
That's the one I originally found but I
thought you were talking about that one.

231
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,520
That was beautiful too though.

232
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,360
He's beautiful.

233
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,200
He's just so charismatic.

234
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,420
Sign up for five years with that.

235
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,010
Especially if it helped my career.

236
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,990
If I just had a inkling of,

237
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,450
of the possibility that maybe
he would hang out with me.

238
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,033
Right.

239
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,013
Cultures,

240
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,050
that's it.

241
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,040
I think I the music like

242
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,453
that,

243
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,350
once you know these tools
and you know that they work,

244
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:30,351
it's just not good enough and I'm just
doing okay traveling the world and

245
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:35,631
meeting the people that I've met now
talking with these leaders get various

246
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:37,014
fields,

247
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,330
they want help and they are depending
on people who know and who can be

248
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:52,290
effective and do it now and that's us.

249
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,350
That is our responsibility to do that.

250
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,640
It is the time.

251
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,230
Now is the time.

252
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,363
Stop it.

253
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,560
Stop this beautiful,

254
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,031
beautiful.

255
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,380
You better.

256
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,810
You better know it.

257
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,153
And if you don't

258
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,510
go and learn it,

259
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,950
oh that's the option.

260
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:14,784
If I don't know it,

261
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,833
learn it.

262
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,240
It's not even the end of it.

263
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,700
The end of it is what I wanted to hear.

264
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:22,430
What he says that if
you stop by an accident,

265
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:24,030
you know you have to
do something cause you,

266
00:07:24,031 --> 00:07:24,864
you're assigned to it.

267
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,880
It's an eight minute video.

268
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,230
Oh here I'll try and skip.

269
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,740
Don't,

270
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,220
don't make me get my dick hard freight.

271
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,160
Yeah.

272
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,320
Yeah.

273
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,370
That's too intense for me.

274
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,960
I just loved the beautiful possible music.

275
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:35,591
I love the,

276
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:36,040
you know,

277
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,020
I love all of them are religious mission.

278
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:40,750
Should you choose to accept it
and the Nike yourself distresses.

279
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,420
Yeah,

280
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,220
the com conviction.

281
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,911
I love the,

282
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:48,500
the fake actor intensity involved in it
and I know that he's just thinking of I

283
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:52,250
have one more hour this and I'm going to
fuck everyone cause he's got this like

284
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,510
10 dudes just waiting for him.

285
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,700
They're prepping them right?

286
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,330
He's like a horse that knows he's on the
end of the trail and he's getting back

287
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:00,141
to the feed bag there.

288
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,240
She knows there's 12 dudes
in the back of warming up,

289
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,860
waxing their beetles that
have done everything right

290
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,470
click every day.

291
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,070
When I think about those people
out there who are depending on us,

292
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,000
it does make me,

293
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,833
Sheila,

294
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,983
we got more work.

295
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,040
I need more help.

296
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,840
I'll get those spectators.

297
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,840
You're into playing
field or out of the arena

298
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,450
in the playing field or out of the arena.

299
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,343
That has been great.

300
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,041
Yeah.

301
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,410
You're either with us who
have the answers and we have,

302
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,560
we can provide all the help to

303
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,670
kill ladies and gentleman,

304
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,730
please watch the whole thing
because there's so much glory in it.

305
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,800
There's so much awesomeness in it.

306
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,360
It's so ridiculous,

307
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,980
but you know what man?

308
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,390
It's like we,

309
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,050
we value charisma like that so much
that a guy like that who can step up and

310
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:05,301
tell you what Scientology can do to
maximize you and that you will be a better

311
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,290
person.

312
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,640
It's not if you become a but
you will be a better person.

313
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,270
Thank you very much.

314
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,450
The reason you're not right now
is because you haven't joined.

315
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:15,781
Come on,

316
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:15,961
dude.

317
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:20,961
How crazy do you have to be to be wearing
a metal to wear a fucking Olympic gold

318
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:23,700
medal bigger than the Olympic medal?

319
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,020
The date they said,

320
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:25,920
what's the Olympic medal?

321
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,660
Mega 10% bigger because this is important.

322
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,720
This brings into one giant metal
and make it match his eyes.

323
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,190
We make it out of the gold we took from
the fillings at Auschwitz and yeah,

324
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,220
that's special evil goal that we have
saved up that we'd been a radiating and

325
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:45,600
saying mean things to for years.

326
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,600
One fucking pile of all the gold that
they know was made in and gotten through

327
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:53,430
the worst circumstances like black beards,

328
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,510
fucking pirate treasure mean.

329
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,540
We know he murdered babies for this goal.

330
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:57,740
Oh,

331
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,351
this is the gold.

332
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,670
I want mold into that.

333
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,430
What do you do?

334
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,690
What do you,

335
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,330
what are you watching?

336
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:01,920
The flights?

337
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,753
No,

338
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,600
you're Tom Cruise screensaver cooked in
all your photos of the half naked said.

339
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:06,811
Okay,

340
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:07,411
stop right there.

341
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:08,244
Back up a second.

342
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,780
Think about this real quick.

343
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,550
Look at him with Val Kilmer.

344
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,030
Yeah,

345
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,530
I'll think about what he looks like,

346
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,730
which is the fucking same.

347
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,770
He's showing him the house,

348
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,400
put inside them in this photo.

349
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,140
What Val Kilmer looks like.

350
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,213
He's saying,

351
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,240
I'm getting you to the elbow.

352
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,103
I iceman.

353
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,580
Val Kilmer.

354
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,290
Val Kilmer has continued to
age whereas Tom Cruise had,

355
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,180
he got to a certain point and then just
stopped because he's been eating from a

356
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:36,030
human liver restaurant and
you don't know about it yet.

357
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,040
The Petri dish.

358
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,310
Human Liver restaurant.

359
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:38,580
Yup.

360
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,000
He goes into the cryo freezer especially
picks his organs as in love with

361
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:42,870
Katie's back in the day.

362
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,410
Meanwhile,

363
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,120
what is he thinking about their cock?

364
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,931
That's what he's thinking about.

365
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:47,470
Cock is thinking about cost there.

366
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,923
He's like,

367
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,160
oh,

368
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,450
that seasons he's ready for it.

369
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,620
Actually only for cock.

370
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,800
I actually want to say on the record that
I don't think he's gay and he doesn't

371
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:58,680
want like that because in my name
is Brian Ryko over in my use,

372
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:01,830
my main stage names Red van and
I disagree with everyone here.

373
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,750
Mr. Cruz and I'm sorry,

374
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,390
what'd you do with it if he doesn't,

375
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:07,530
even if he doesn't want cock,

376
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,700
I think you should try it.

377
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,120
Yeah.

378
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,510
Cause uh,

379
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,343
it might be his thing.

380
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,801
Brian,

381
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:11,730
would you do a five,

382
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:13,140
five year stint with Tom Cruise?

383
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,170
If it meant unlimited
wealth and career success?

384
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,800
Five months.

385
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,570
Let's just say five months in my compound.

386
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:18,731
Oh,

387
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,910
I have to have sex or just hang
out with him for thank you have to.

388
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:23,040
You have to either stuck
or be fucked by Tom Cruise.

389
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,340
One of the two has to happen for sure.

390
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,230
I unlimited wealth,

391
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,191
unlimited wealth.

392
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:26,610
Sure.

393
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,390
And success.

394
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,931
What'd you do now?

395
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:28,764
Career success.

396
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,670
Five months.

397
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,151
Tom Cruise.

398
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:30,780
Sex Life.

399
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,613
Absolutely not.

400
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,510
You wouldn't for unlimited.

401
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:34,320
Well No.

402
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,370
What is unlimited wealth?

403
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,170
Doe just never having to worry about it.

404
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,681
Yeah,

405
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:39,170
but could you buy like jets and shit?

406
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,013
Certainly.

407
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,450
You can imagine your butthole.

408
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,600
You're letting a guy fuck your
butthole was worth that much.

409
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,700
It was like there was a
way you can negotiate it.

410
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,180
I'm sure it is.

411
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,100
The some salt out there somewhere now.

412
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:52,530
People think of it that they're like
sucked your Dick just for dinner and like,

413
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:53,080
really,

414
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,100
I could have gotten unlimited

415
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,550
wealth of,

416
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,260
I just got a better agent.
