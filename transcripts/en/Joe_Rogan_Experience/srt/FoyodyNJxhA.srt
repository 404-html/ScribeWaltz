1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,313
And we're live.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,293
What's up?

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,660
Uh,

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,310
nothing.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,160
I was actually doing this.

6
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:14,860
Appreciate it.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,140
Yeah.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,960
Thanks for having me.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,051
Oh,

10
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:16,860
look how you dressed.

11
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,150
Very casual look like.

12
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:18,900
Yeah.

13
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,410
It's all about comfort these days.

14
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,781
Like monk,

15
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:23,460
like he's like a lot of monk.

16
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:24,001
Like to what?

17
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,910
You got the shaved head and the
wooden beads and the whole deal.

18
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,330
Yeah.

19
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,163
Yeah.

20
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,350
I mean I kind of decided that like I
ever since cutting my hair that uh,

21
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,741
I don't know.

22
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,350
I'm just going to do
away with like not being,

23
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,420
like not being comfortable in any area.

24
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:40,610
So heels,

25
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,320
um,

26
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,570
you kinda had to pay me to do that.

27
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,920
Really?

28
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,251
Yeah.

29
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:44,610
I Dunno.

30
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,450
It's just the,

31
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,470
I'm not a big fan of heels
because I can't run away in them.

32
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,801
That's good point.

33
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,060
I think that's why they made him.

34
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:51,840
Yeah,

35
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:51,970
no,

36
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,501
it makes sense.

37
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:57,300
Like girls wearing tight skirts where
your legs are constricted or tight dresses

38
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,740
and go down to your knees especially.

39
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,220
Yeah.

40
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,850
Those things are,

41
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,980
that's like a thing where
girls can like barely walk.

42
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:02,820
You have the heels,

43
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,300
your,

44
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,260
your toes are down.

45
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,760
It's like the opposite of being strong.

46
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,740
It's like you're very vulnerable,

47
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,350
right.

48
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,190
Very vulnerable.

49
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:08,461
Yeah.

50
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,090
Like,

51
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,690
um,

52
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,760
I don't know if it's just because
of like the way I grew up,

53
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,220
but I was always like
looking over my shoulder.

54
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,830
Like anytime I was walking
down the wrong alley,

55
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:17,491
I was always,

56
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:18,324
uh,

57
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,020
you know,

58
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,880
ready to scope out the area,

59
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,441
you know,

60
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:22,440
just running,

61
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,423
be able to run.

62
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,690
I think everybody's like that though,

63
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:25,050
right?

64
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,261
I mean,

65
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:25,440
yeah.

66
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,340
Especially girls.

67
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,450
You should be.

68
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,050
Yeah.

69
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,883
I mean,

70
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,180
just me in particular,

71
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:32,940
just because that was the only
girl that looked like myself.

72
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:36,510
I was the smallest all the
time or youngest are like
the only white girl on my

73
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:36,811
black.

74
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:37,680
So it was always like,

75
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,640
uh,

76
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,900
I stood out and,

77
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:40,734
um,

78
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,610
so yeah,

79
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,444
I like to,

80
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,350
I like to be safe.

81
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,000
That's smart.

82
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,420
Yeah.

83
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,290
Or be able to like,

84
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,621
you know,

85
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:47,610
throw it kick in these pants.

86
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:48,761
Yeah.

87
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:51,500
Those were those like sweatpants
or something when he got on a,

88
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,380
these are called Harem pants.

89
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:54,214
Harem pants.

90
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,450
Yeah.

91
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,780
And she would get up there with that.

92
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,071
Oh,

93
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:57,611
they're crazy.

94
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:58,110
They're like,

95
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,440
they've got cool designs on them.

96
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:00,370
What are those designs?

97
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,633
Um,

98
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,640
I don't really know,

99
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,760
but they're very comfy and I got,

100
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,450
um,

101
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,930
they came off of this website called
Harem pants.com or something like that.

102
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,250
And what are the wooden beads about?

103
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,571
So this is,

104
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,320
um,

105
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,610
this is a guy,

106
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:15,690
I got it from a friend,

107
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,441
a Cassie,

108
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:17,490
rob who is also a fighter.

109
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,300
She's my teammate.

110
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,710
I'm back at home and she,

111
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:20,190
uh,

112
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,760
she gave it to me leading up to
the fight with Joanna and uh,

113
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,560
just for some strength and courage that
think this is supposed to like give you

114
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,840
like some type of confidence or whatever.

115
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:31,830
Yeah.

116
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,060
It's just like an energy beat.

117
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:34,440
I don't know if it really like,

118
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:34,681
I mean,

119
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:35,281
I guess it works,

120
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,300
but you know,

121
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:36,541
leave.

122
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:36,931
It works.

123
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:37,470
It works.

124
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,101
Exactly.

125
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:38,251
Yeah.

126
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:39,810
That's kind of how I was feeling about it.

127
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:39,960
Right.

128
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
The placebo effect.

129
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:41,350
Right.

130
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,040
Yeah.

131
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,610
I got to tell you that your victory
speech after you beat you on,

132
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:45,850
uh,

133
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,850
was my all time favorite because it
wasn't even just about you or about the

134
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:52,150
fight.

135
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,560
It wasn't about anything.

136
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,350
It was just you expressing yourself.

137
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:56,590
Pat,

138
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,240
what are you doing over there?

139
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,660
All right.

140
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,493
Try them out the cell.

141
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,350
Okay.

142
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,183
Tassel.

143
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,081
Yeah.

144
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,530
No,

145
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,010
uh,

146
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,940
I just think that,

147
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,774
um,

148
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,060
uh,

149
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,980
it was an awesome victory speech.

150
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:08,970
It was really amazing.

151
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,511
It was a,

152
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:10,500
you were,

153
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,850
you know,

154
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,730
you were just spilling your
heart out and it was in your,

155
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,990
your moment to shine and in
your moment to shine you,

156
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,370
you didn't make it about you.

157
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,250
I think I fight better that way,

158
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,671
you know,

159
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:22,980
when,

160
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,420
um,

161
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,253
um,

162
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:24,690
you know,

163
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,910
it's always about me,

164
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:26,960
like throughout the training camp,

165
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:27,501
like everybody,

166
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:28,970
like my coaches and teammates,

167
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:32,930
they're always helping me and just
gets to be a bit much sometimes,

168
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:33,141
you know,

169
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:33,621
and I want to,

170
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:34,310
um,

171
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,360
I want to help other people.

172
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,730
It feels my spiritual cup more,

173
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,893
um,

174
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,410
you know,

175
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,370
spiritual cup.

176
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,330
Yeah.

177
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,960
I think that,

178
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,201
you know,

179
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,034
I've,

180
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,353
uh,

181
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:44,961
you know,

182
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:45,230
if he,

183
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:45,491
if,

184
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,940
if your hands close to,

185
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,541
to give,

186
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:47,781
you know,

187
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,580
you can't be open to
receive kind of thing.

188
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:51,290
And I think that,

189
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:51,950
um,

190
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,810
the more that I can give to people,

191
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:55,130
the more that I can get myself,

192
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,490
you know?

193
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,121
And I think that,

194
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:56,570
um,

195
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:56,781
you know,

196
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:58,280
just like plants and animals,

197
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:58,730
the way,

198
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:58,970
you know,

199
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,803
if you look in nature,

200
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,600
everything is a symbiotic relationship.

201
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,740
I think that humans could be the same way.

202
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,130
Interesting.

203
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:05,970
Where you're looking at things,

204
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:07,410
if you always looked at things like that.

205
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,570
No.

206
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,403
Uh,

207
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,370
uh,

208
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,170
I shouldn't say not always,

209
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:12,551
but a,

210
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,330
I always was a person that,

211
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,010
you know,

212
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,850
want it to be outside.

213
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:17,661
I want us to be in nature.

214
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:18,430
I grew up in a,

215
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,920
like urban jungle and Milwaukee
and just concrete everywhere,

216
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:22,161
you know,

217
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,780
no place to go outside except for,

218
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:24,021
you know,

219
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:25,790
just playing in the alleys and stuff.

220
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,031
But,

221
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:26,864
uh,

222
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,123
um,

223
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,773
my,

224
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,280
my lineage is from Lithuania where
they're like very in tune with nature and

225
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:38,350
they're pagans and like
slash Christian and uh,

226
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,590
so they really,

227
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:39,910
you know,

228
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,340
just,

229
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,390
just my whole family,

230
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:41,600
you know,

231
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,030
they come from living off
the land and stuff like that.

232
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,890
And so that's always been
something I wanted to do.

233
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,010
Um,

234
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,440
I would just put in a situation,

235
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:48,981
you know,

236
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:49,814
just to,

237
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,630
you know,

238
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,850
try and do martial arts
and trying to like,

239
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,103
uh,

240
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,943
you know,

241
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,440
I guess control my emotions and stuff.

242
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:01,790
Just living in this chaotic
environment that I grew up in and um,

243
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,520
nature is where I felt
the most piece that,

244
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:07,010
so that's always something
that I connected with.

245
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,420
And then the more that I kind of,

246
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,763
uh,

247
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,100
focus on nature and animals
and stuff like that,

248
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:13,881
I noticed that,

249
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:14,600
you know,

250
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,560
there's a,

251
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,851
I don't know,

252
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,830
I tried to live my life the same way.

253
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,290
Who is this interesting
leading up to that fight too?

254
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,180
That you are kind of like the antidote
to a lot of things that people are

255
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:24,980
getting annoyed at.

256
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,813
An May,

257
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,330
all the trash talking and
all the negativity and all
the like fighting at press

258
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,164
conferences,

259
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,130
you just shut all that shit down with you.

260
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:35,964
Ana.

261
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,080
There needs to be balanced.

262
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,351
You know,

263
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:38,070
it's like,

264
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,720
I mean I like entertainment,

265
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:40,554
you know,

266
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,180
I,

267
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,550
you know,

268
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,780
I should talk sometimes too,

269
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:43,614
you know,

270
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,540
but uh,

271
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:44,970
I,

272
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,140
there just has to be a balance,

273
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:46,301
you know?

274
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,460
And it has to be honest too,

275
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:49,500
like if you really feel
this way about somebody,

276
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:51,570
like if you're really
upset with this person.

277
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:51,731
Yeah.

278
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,471
I say how you feel,

279
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:56,100
but like don't just go out of your way
just to be entertaining because you think

280
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:57,990
it's going to be funny or something or you

281
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,870
think it's just going to be like,

282
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,010
it's not genuine,

283
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,510
you know?

284
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,990
Right.

285
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,810
Yeah.

286
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,670
But it was just the way
you handle yourself.

287
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,860
Like cause her whole
thing is talking shit,

288
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,600
the whole thing is scaring people.

289
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,440
I'm the Boogie woman
and coming to get you,

290
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,600
you know all that stuff and you were just
dead faced and I think that fucked her

291
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:15,434
head up.

292
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:15,900
Oh really?

293
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,230
Do you ever see that video of like the,

294
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,620
what was that video with all that?

295
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,410
Not that one.

296
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,700
The one you just showed me earlier,

297
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,150
it was like,

298
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,160
is this dude like standing
in front of an elephant?

299
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,250
And it like started charging
at him and he was like,

300
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:28,910
calm,

301
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,450
you know?

302
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,410
And he just stood there.

303
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,403
Yeah.

304
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,920
I don't know how to phrase

305
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,283
trample them.

306
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,990
Elephant is coming through and it's like,

307
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,410
yeah,

308
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,750
I've seen that just
stands there in one spot.

309
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,663
It stops.

310
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,670
Don't try that at home.

311
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,683
Yeah.

312
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,310
Obviously because you're
talking about an animal,

313
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,411
but it's just,

314
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,050
I think it's a good analogy to draw from.

315
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,010
Like Yolanda Energy.

316
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:57,170
She was very chaotic and very,

317
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,890
um,

318
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,840
in my face and very threatening.

319
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,570
Intimidating.

320
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,070
Yeah.

321
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,610
And like,

322
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:01,821
yeah,

323
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,060
don't go out of your way to stand in
front of an elephant is running at you.

324
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:05,540
Like,

325
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,740
don't put yourself in that position.

326
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:07,574
But I,

327
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,841
I had to be there.

328
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:09,560
That's my job.

329
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,980
You know?

330
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,550
So,

331
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,821
um,

332
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,770
so when you're in those
situations where he like,

333
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,911
you don't know what's,

334
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:14,361
do you know?

335
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:15,194
You just stay calm.

336
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,001
Yeah.

337
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:16,151
Well,

338
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,680
you didn't just stay calm.

339
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:22,270
You stayed eerily calm and you were like
reciting the Lord's prayer when I asked

340
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:22,541
you that,

341
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:22,931
I was like,

342
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:23,471
whoa.

343
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:23,771
It was like,

344
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:24,730
what are you saying over there?

345
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:25,001
And you're like,

346
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,150
I'm reciting the Lord's prayer.

347
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,123
Yeah.

348
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,453
Yeah.

349
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,050
Uh,

350
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,811
the whole training camp,

351
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:32,491
it was just crazy.

352
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:34,410
But like that week in particular,

353
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:37,770
like I was convinced that
this might be my last fight.

354
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,360
This might be my last day on earth.

355
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:43,260
Like I was so just like ready
for anything at that point.

356
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,163
You know,

357
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,450
there might be your last fight.

358
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,441
I don't know.

359
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:47,274
Some crazy.

360
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,900
I Dunno just cause,

361
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:49,734
uh,

362
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:51,781
I don't know.

363
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:56,540
I think I started to think that almost
like every fight is because it's a crazy

364
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,450
with stuff.

365
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:57,930
Yeah,

366
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:58,763
it's tough,

367
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,510
but it's the best thing in the world.

368
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,580
Especially the,

369
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,443
the,

370
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,410
all of the,

371
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,420
all of the stressors that came
along with this fight in particular,

372
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,840
right.

373
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,310
Especially all of those like [inaudible].

374
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,430
And then we have what we've,

375
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:12,861
we've had,

376
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:13,580
uh,

377
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,390
in that fight we had a,

378
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,223
we had a few,

379
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,453
like kind of,

380
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,260
I don't want to say magical moments,

381
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,970
but say for instance,

382
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,180
uh,

383
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,860
we bring Mishka with us everywhere we go.

384
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,120
I'm dog.

385
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,060
Our flight was delayed three hours,

386
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,631
four hours.

387
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,160
And when we landed,

388
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,570
we landed like a few hours after that
truck drove through the park and killed

389
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:33,500
all the people in New York,

390
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,360
which was right by our hotel,

391
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,070
which if we would have been there on time,

392
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,400
we would have feel assigned the posters
and then been outside at the park

393
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,593
walking Misha.

394
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,111
So I mean,

395
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:43,370
just little things like,

396
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:43,851
like that,

397
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:48,851
like we would have been outside maybe at
that spot and had been witness to that.

398
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,120
I heard it or something
and that would affected me,

399
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:52,690
you know,

400
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,523
and um,

401
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,030
the Antifa march.

402
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,461
Yeah.

403
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:56,000
And there is just

404
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,960
all this stuff about,

405
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:57,261
you know,

406
00:08:57,261 --> 00:09:00,020
like people who are going to be protesting
and stuff like that and they even

407
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:03,650
like the day of the fight and I just
get a lot of anxiety over that stuff.

408
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:06,140
I get anxiety over like big
crowds of people and it's like,

409
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,011
you know,

410
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:07,844
just feel like crazy.

411
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,450
Yeah.

412
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,020
Um,

413
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,321
you know,

414
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:10,154
and it's,

415
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,233
uh,

416
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,321
yeah,

417
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:12,860
I just,

418
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,130
I wasn't even just thinking about the
fight when you wanna it was more than

419
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:16,400
that,

420
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,820
you know,

421
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,400
it was like,

422
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,700
whatever,

423
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,180
what all her energy represented to me.

424
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:21,230
Like all my past,

425
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:21,760
like,

426
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,100
um,

427
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,440
just negative people that,

428
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,040
you know,

429
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,850
uh,

430
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,091
you know,

431
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:28,040
want to want to strike
fear into your heart,

432
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,933
you know,

433
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,331
and,

434
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:29,660
um,

435
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,030
I wasn't gonna let that happen
even though I was scared,

436
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:32,751
but you know,

437
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,171
I just,

438
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:33,650
uh,

439
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,690
I wasn't gonna stop doing what I
was doing just because of that.

440
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,600
Well you were really eerily focused,

441
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:40,750
like one time she stuck her fist
in your face and touch your face.

442
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:41,584
You didn't even move.

443
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,390
Yeah.

444
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,110
Cause I know she needed
a reaction from me.

445
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,411
You know,

446
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:45,244
it's just like,

447
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,990
um,

448
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,110
it was just like with anybody,

449
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:47,411
you know,

450
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:50,380
so you don't give energy
to something negative,

451
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,760
you don't feed the fire,

452
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:52,160
you know?

453
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,431
Yeah.

454
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:53,930
That's gotta be a mind
fuck for her though.

455
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,300
Right,

456
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,660
right.

457
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:54,900
Yeah.

458
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,800
Used to people reacting to
her and headbutting going
head to head with her and

459
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,750
trying to show her and you just stay calm.

460
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,900
Yeah.

461
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,710
Cause I mean,

462
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,280
you know,

463
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,113
it's,

464
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,230
it's uh,

465
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,420
either you really,

466
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,441
I mean,

467
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,490
it's either one or two things.

468
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,100
Either you really disliked
me enough to like,

469
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,030
you know,

470
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,820
put your hands on me outside of
the competition or his fight,

471
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,181
you know,

472
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:19,200
or it's a character,

473
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,760
or are you just doing this for show?

474
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,240
Right.

475
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,511
You know,

476
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:24,510
it's either one of the two and I just
don't think she's really a bad person.

477
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,553
I just think that,

478
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:25,921
you know,

479
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:27,840
she's put in this position and maybe she,

480
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,110
you know,

481
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,280
that's what she felt like she had to do.

482
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:29,660
Well,

483
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,980
I wrote something about
the Volcker on the mirror,

484
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,250
uh,

485
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,480
Daniel Cormier fight the other day that
what owes Tamir was trying to do and

486
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,380
what core me was trying to do.

487
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:41,010
It's like they're trying to sow
seeds of doubt that you're trying to,

488
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,210
there's a real issue with someone that's
about to fight where you're about to

489
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,940
compete and it's this
crazy nerve wracking thing.

490
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,080
And the unknown is always there.

491
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,160
You don't know what's gonna Happen,

492
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,490
right?

493
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,020
So someone can convince you,

494
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:53,160
I'm gonna fuck you up.

495
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:53,461
You're like,

496
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,430
God damn is he gonna fuck me up and
really start thinking it if you,

497
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,660
if it's in your head.

498
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,020
And that one of the things that Daniel
said in that fight was that there's,

499
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,250
there's levels to this thing.

500
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:02,410
Like,

501
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,410
you think you're going to come
in and fuck me up with his car.

502
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,520
He's like this,

503
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,340
he's not you,

504
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,173
you're not,

505
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,850
you haven't experienced this yet.

506
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,550
Right.

507
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,990
And as it's something that I,

508
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:11,824
you know,

509
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,663
I,

510
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:12,971
I,

511
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:13,420
uh,

512
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,251
have high respect for you.

513
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:14,830
You want to sue,

514
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,191
you know,

515
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:19,090
and I think it's great that I was putting
this position to face her because I

516
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:20,620
had to get better and are like,

517
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:22,690
I had to get up to that level,

518
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,271
you know,

519
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:23,771
to face her.

520
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:25,930
And I had to do a lot of research and,

521
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:26,710
uh,

522
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,720
work on my mental stability.

523
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:28,871
I mean,

524
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:31,060
she kept saying I was mentally
unstable like you and those,

525
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,660
you know,

526
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,680
phone calls and stuff,

527
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:34,210
like the conference calls beforehand.

528
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,000
And I was like,

529
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,820
f you were mentally unstable.

530
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,250
What was the cause?

531
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,610
Rose's mentally unstable.

532
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,630
Yeah.

533
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,811
Oh,

534
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:41,644
my dad is,

535
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,760
my dad was just correct.

536
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,870
Like in what way?

537
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,063
Uh,

538
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,933
I mean,

539
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,601
well,

540
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:47,380
I don't know,

541
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,741
to me,

542
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,210
I can't speak for myself,

543
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:49,900
but like,

544
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,380
uh,

545
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:50,630
it's just,

546
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,463
uh,

547
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,020
please do,

548
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,331
oh wait,

549
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:53,730
I'm sorry.

550
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,350
Could go it.

551
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,183
Okay.

552
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,960
It's like everyone
getting ready for a fight.

553
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,660
It's,

554
00:11:59,660 --> 00:11:59,921
it's,

555
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:00,754
um,

556
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,790
there are some people who can be excited
about the fight the entire time when

557
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,440
they don't give a shit about
anything and they just,

558
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,141
they just delete it.

559
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:06,850
I love it.

560
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,440
And then there's also the ones who,

561
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,900
who get ready for a fight and
while getting ready for the fight,

562
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,010
it's nerve wracking.

563
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,170
And especially with all of
the Boogie woman and all the,

564
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:16,570
you're mentally unstable.

565
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:20,290
And then in the history with her dad and
her history growing up and just all of

566
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,610
those things coming to a head,

567
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,010
this was exactly what
rose wanted it to be,

568
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,040
the scariest possible situation for
her to be in New York with the end,

569
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,930
with the Antifa march that happened in
front of the hotel the morning of we,

570
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,020
we almost didn't make it to the fight.

571
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,150
Then march had what was going on.

572
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,970
This was the Anti Donald Trump march.

573
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,020
Yeah.

574
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,290
And it sounded way better than it was

575
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,381
walk.

576
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:45,621
Right.

577
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:46,940
We had a walk to the arena.

578
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,600
No,

579
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,060
that was year before it happened.

580
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,810
The morning of the fight right
through the front of the hotel,

581
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,580
which,

582
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,120
which that,

583
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,760
that's fine,

584
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,960
but rose had seen some weeks in advance,

585
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,900
someone somewhere posts
that Antifa was going to,

586
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,150
they were going to strike on November 4th.

587
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,000
I though they were planning,

588
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,220
they were planning on a strike or nothing.

589
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,080
Like seriously.

590
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,914
I was like,

591
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,940
we were getting ready,

592
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:14,440
like we had done our morning shake out,

593
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:14,980
you know,

594
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,390
uh,

595
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,190
and then morning shake
out the day of the fight.

596
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,090
We always like to,

597
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,920
um,

598
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,410
I was like to like first thing we do
when we get up is just shake it out.

599
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:24,020
Like,

600
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
cause you all your nerves and stuff.

601
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:26,261
Like all,

602
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:30,070
you're like nervous energy is inside of
you the day of the fight and you just

603
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:30,460
want to,

604
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,710
you don't want to go to
the arena the first time.

605
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,230
Breaking a sweat or getting
that heavy breathing,

606
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,651
you know,

607
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:36,484
because

608
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,530
before going to the arena,

609
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,723
yeah.

610
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,580
Light Mitt work or

611
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,181
uh,

612
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:42,801
actually we,

613
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,040
we blow it out hard.

614
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,300
Like when you just get it out,

615
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:45,571
you know,

616
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:45,781
like,

617
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:45,931
like,

618
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:48,620
you know when you first started running
or something or you do a workout and you

619
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,680
just like breathing heavy,

620
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:51,760
like he gets your first
like heavy wind out.

621
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:57,050
That's like you just blow right through
it and then just say pads like intense,

622
00:13:58,231 --> 00:13:58,471
you know,

623
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,131
just whatever.

624
00:13:59,131 --> 00:13:59,701
I'm actually,

625
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:01,650
it is like you go off of a feel,

626
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:01,981
you know,

627
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,390
whenever you're feeling like some days.

628
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,070
Um,

629
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,310
when I fought Teesha I was,

630
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,533
uh,

631
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,460
like kind of sick and anti
like on antibiotics cause
I like got the red tide or

632
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:12,120
something say like,

633
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,680
and I barely slept and like,

634
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,430
so I didn't,

635
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,440
our shakeout was not very long.

636
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,393
Like it was like,

637
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:17,821
okay,

638
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,830
I gotta save my energy
to get to the arena.

639
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:20,870
So we barely even did want,

640
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:21,930
but like for this one,

641
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,063
um,

642
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,960
shakeout was pretty normal.

643
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,720
You know,

644
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,280
it,

645
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,240
we just hit pads,

646
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,800
your parents for about seven minutes
and then she shadowbox real hard.

647
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,933
Yeah,

648
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,021
five minutes.

649
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:33,370
And then

650
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,530
maybe it might do a little bit of
grappling or something like that,

651
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:36,364
but yeah.

652
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,340
And then I'll go take a nap.

653
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:39,790
Like,

654
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,270
you know,

655
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,860
uh,

656
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,681
can a shower,

657
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:41,921
you know,

658
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,720
kind of visualized and just like lay down,

659
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:44,501
not even take a nap,

660
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,670
but just like close your eyes.

661
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,730
And it was like the same
thing on the day of a fight.

662
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,980
I barely even eat on a fight day.

663
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,460
Like I,

664
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,460
the way I cut weight as,

665
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:54,294
I'll do like a,

666
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,480
the day before I'll do it.

667
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:55,671
I mean,

668
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:56,990
I don't really have to
cut that much weight,

669
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:57,760
so,

670
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,310
um,

671
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,590
but like I'll do like a juice fast,

672
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,130
like,

673
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,370
oh,

674
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,110
for one day I'll just drink fluids.

675
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:03,920
Um,

676
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,620
and then the next day I'll sit in a
hot shower and then just sweat it out.

677
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,580
Um,

678
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,241
because I don't like to,

679
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:08,680
I,

680
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,560
I don't like to,

681
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:10,394
um,

682
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,110
dehydrate myself too much.

683
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,980
Like I'd rather have
fluids and no food then,

684
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,340
then lots of food in my stomach,

685
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,920
no fluids.

686
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,191
Right.

687
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:17,980
And she's talking about
sweating out two pounds.

688
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,250
I set up no like five pounds
last time you have a bigger,

689
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:22,820
no.

690
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,653
Uh,

691
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,370
this fight was,

692
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,460
I think it was like one 25 30.

693
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,443
I can't remember.

694
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,050
I think like the week of the fight I was
like one 27 and like by the time wait

695
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:33,801
cause started,

696
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:35,420
I was like one 25 ish.

697
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,100
You're cutting timber one 20.

698
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,601
She was what?

699
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:38,100
She was fine.

700
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,230
Now one thing I can't remember,

701
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,064
I don't even know.

702
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,360
Oh,

703
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,400
when we started the way gushy
rose walks around lately.

704
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,840
Lately because of uh,

705
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,010
this is just the growth and size lately
she's been walking around one 25,

706
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:50,720
one 27 but uh,

707
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,171
every,

708
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,250
every fight it'll like
the day before William.

709
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,980
She's,

710
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,813
yeah,

711
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,913
yeah,

712
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,250
yeah,

713
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,100
but I'm talking about going to the sauna.

714
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,050
Are we going to do to get this one off?

715
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:02,080
It's like I man,

716
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,983
you'll spit.

717
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,831
So you,

718
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:05,250
um,

719
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,520
you don't have like a particular type
of food that you like to eat the day of

720
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,600
a kind of food like carbohydrate
rich or like what do you want?

721
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,600
Depends on where I'm at.

722
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,463
So like,

723
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:14,981
you know,

724
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:18,650
because every place has different food
and like some places they just like nasty

725
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:18,971
food.

726
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:20,230
But I'm in New York,

727
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:23,290
there's this like little smoothie shop
across the street and there's this like

728
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,020
most delicious smoothie that I like,

729
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,150
just had it always,

730
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,880
what a chocolatier.

731
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,621
Oh this is really good.

732
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,090
So I had that like every day of the week.

733
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,990
And that was,

734
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,860
I think the day of the fight.

735
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,300
I had like a little bit of that,

736
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,320
but I don't know.

737
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,310
Um,

738
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,120
when he used the,

739
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,470
when Marty Morgan was his coach,

740
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:39,730
he's always used to say like,

741
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,090
you know,

742
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,380
you have enough food and energy in you
to sustain you for the five days more

743
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:45,161
just like mentally,

744
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,330
like if you want to eat something.

745
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,780
Right.

746
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,140
But,

747
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,590
um,

748
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,450
so I so ever since he had ever said that,

749
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:49,781
I was like,

750
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:49,961
yeah,

751
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:50,794
I never,

752
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,580
I never wanted to eat during
fight day cause I'm just like,

753
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:55,600
so yeah,

754
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:55,991
you can't,

755
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:56,860
you can't digest it.

756
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,350
You have to be like relaxed and
kind of dire to follow normally.

757
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,730
Ah,

758
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,950
I try and make everything
homemade as possible.

759
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:04,090
So that's like kind of my thing,

760
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:04,391
you know,

761
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,230
I'm never like,

762
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,840
I'm never anti anything
I don't like to be like,

763
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,030
I mean except for lots of sugar and
obviously like things that are like

764
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,610
obviously bad for you.

765
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,743
Um,

766
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,340
I like to,

767
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:15,761
yeah,

768
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,280
I like to make everything from
scratch as much as possible.

769
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:19,114
And the more,

770
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,053
yeah.

771
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,830
Um,

772
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,010
the more like the more,

773
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,330
uh,

774
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,220
process as something takes in
order to make it from scratch,

775
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:28,330
I think the less you should eat it.

776
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,433
You know,

777
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,910
like if like something like bread,

778
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,361
you know,

779
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:32,470
if you do it from scratch,

780
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:35,530
like make your own a starter
culture and like you,

781
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,310
um,

782
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,320
that takes like a week by
itself and you have to add more,

783
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,510
add flour and water to it,

784
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:42,970
like over time as he's another two weeks.

785
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,450
So like,

786
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,020
you shouldn't be eating bread every day,

787
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,060
you know,

788
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,871
so it takes a lot of work.

789
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:47,201
But like,

790
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:47,590
say,

791
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,861
you know,

792
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:49,000
if you have like a garden,

793
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,160
you've got tomatoes,

794
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:50,580
which,

795
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:50,821
you know,

796
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:51,870
we grew the last camp,

797
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,770
uh,

798
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:52,981
you know,

799
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:55,440
you could just eat those real easy
cause you just pick it and eat it.

800
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,510
So you make your own bread too?

801
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,310
Um,

802
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,541
I,

803
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,870
I tried once and it was,

804
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,630
it was all right,

805
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,890
but sorry,

806
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:02,701
go on it a little bit more,

807
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:03,511
but that's like my goal,

808
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:03,751
you know,

809
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,370
it's like to try and make
everything from scratch.

810
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:06,390
And that's interesting.

811
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,500
She's at your Gerald Kabuga.

812
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,220
Oh yeah.

813
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,551
By the way,

814
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:09,331
this is pretty good.

815
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:10,290
Like normally I don't,

816
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:10,830
oh,

817
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,280
like,

818
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,530
uh,

819
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,720
I would um,

820
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,090
use this brand to like make my own gts.

821
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,540
Yeah.

822
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,490
Like to do like the
starter scoby and whatever.

823
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:18,370
But um,

824
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,030
I usually don't like them just like bye.

825
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,230
But this one was pretty good.

826
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,500
Yeah.

827
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,240
GTS,

828
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,970
my favorite there.

829
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,660
Then you'd have to have a
driver's license to purchase that.

830
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:27,740
You have to be over 21.

831
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,310
Really?

832
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,491
Yeah,

833
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:31,610
because it's got more than one
half of 1% alcohol by volume,

834
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,150
so it's impossible to get drunk off of it.

835
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,720
I mean,

836
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,040
yeah,

837
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
just got a very marginal,

838
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
because of the fermentation,

839
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:41,060
there's a marginal amount
of natural alcohol in it.

840
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:41,630
Yeah.

841
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,171
So you have,

842
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:43,280
but that's the good ones.

843
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,590
The other other ones you
can buy in any store,

844
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,370
those aren't.

845
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:46,591
Yeah.

846
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,331
It was just like,

847
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:47,690
yeah,

848
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,940
they don't even have
like the Scoby and I'm,

849
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:50,420
I like,

850
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,680
I like making it myself though,

851
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,600
cause I think it tastes a lot better.

852
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,610
Like I'll use green
teams that a black teen,

853
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,420
um,

854
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,760
all I add ginger and
stuff like that to it.

855
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,060
Okay,

856
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,600
cool.

857
00:18:59,600 --> 00:18:59,870
Yeah,

858
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,651
I did that for a while.

859
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:01,550
I just get tired of it.

860
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,330
Yeah.

861
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,841
Big Bowls.

862
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,530
Land around the experiments.

863
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,990
Yeah,

864
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,440
yeah,

865
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,920
yeah.

866
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,753
But it's fun.

867
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,271
It's fun to do.

868
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,830
But I was doing that in the 90s.

869
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,250
Yeah.

870
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,521
Way,

871
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:11,354
way back.

872
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:11,870
Yeah.

873
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,520
I got one from Andy Dick and Dick gave
me like he was making in his house.

874
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,051
He gave me some,

875
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:18,321
I was like,

876
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:19,280
this is actually pretty good.

877
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,300
Yeah,

878
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,720
yeah,

879
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,230
yeah,

880
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,601
I know.

881
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:22,010
So,

882
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,341
so yeah,

883
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:23,001
like diet wise,

884
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:25,820
I mean I try not to be
too scientifical on stuff,

885
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,683
but um,

886
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,153
you know,

887
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,030
uh,

888
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,451
whatever,

889
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:30,770
like whatever feel good,

890
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,970
like whatever makes you feel good,

891
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:32,990
I think is what you should eat.

892
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,843
Um,

893
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,670
and you don't,

894
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,440
I don't like sweets or anything like that.

895
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,101
I don't really,

896
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:37,850
I grew up,

897
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,121
you know,

898
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,470
my mom was Lithuanian,

899
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,010
like,

900
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,460
uh,

901
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,040
my parents were actually late
Lithuanian refugees that came.

902
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:48,041
I'm first generation American and we grew
up eating sauerkraut and potatoes and

903
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:48,831
you know,

904
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:51,260
just real eastern European types of,

905
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:51,980
you know,

906
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,150
so I never really,

907
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,250
I never really like candy
or anything like that.

908
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:55,920
So I've always just been,

909
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,070
it's been like a lifestyle
for me and never like,

910
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,133
uh,

911
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,940
a thing that I'm on this
diet that I have to do.

912
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:02,700
And you know what I mean?

913
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,533
Right.

914
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,221
Now.

915
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:05,990
How did you get involved in martial arts?

916
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,431
Um,

917
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:08,300
I said they had put a,

918
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:08,630
uh,

919
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,020
put my,

920
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,970
me and my brother am taekwondo,

921
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:12,080
like from a young age.

922
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,640
And then from there,

923
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,050
you know,

924
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,030
it was just such a positive thing for me,

925
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:19,100
just cause like it kept us out of trouble,

926
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,610
Eh,

927
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:19,881
you know,

928
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:21,410
taught me how to defend myself,

929
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,610
gave me confidence,

930
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,570
things like that.

931
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:23,870
Um,

932
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,480
and then we also like watch lot
of dragon ball z growing out.

933
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:27,101
So like we,

934
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:27,411
you know,

935
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:28,100
we were like,

936
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,670
you know,

937
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,370
that as is or whatever and
without get power up his stuff.

938
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:33,740
So it was a fun thing for like as kids.

939
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:34,280
And then we kind of,

940
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,990
it kind of just evolved into more
of like a real life application and,

941
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:39,824
um,

942
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,551
you know,

943
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:41,660
babies and make fun of us,

944
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:42,200
like,

945
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,501
you know,

946
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,101
for doing that.

947
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:44,270
But we all also use,

948
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:44,540
again,

949
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,970
like little fights on like in
our neighborhoods and stuff.

950
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,823
And um,

951
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,881
you know,

952
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,500
my love for martial arts grew from that.

953
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,570
And then I just wanted
to try every martial art,

954
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:52,931
you know,

955
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:53,470
it's like,

956
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,130
you know,

957
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,090
the like,

958
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,160
like a flavors of ice cream,

959
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:57,351
you know,

960
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:58,450
you just wanted to try all of it.

961
00:20:58,451 --> 00:20:59,020
So,

962
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,681
so I tried,

963
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:00,514
um,

964
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,540
uh,

965
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,740
karate after that.

966
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,400
Then,

967
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,970
uh,

968
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,040
that's where I got introduced
to Jujitsu for the first time.

969
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,180
Like real basic,

970
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:07,781
you know,

971
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,460
positional things and then,

972
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,313
um,

973
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,781
you know,

974
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,160
weapons and stuff.

975
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,363
Uh,

976
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,620
yeah,

977
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,730
I did stick fighting for a while.

978
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,564
That was pretty fun.

979
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,120
Yeah.

980
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,490
Uh,

981
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,580
with like you get like
the head cage on you,

982
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:21,550
it's like whack each other.

983
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,820
But um,

984
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,770
and then a pankration.

985
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,510
And then after that,

986
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:29,680
once I got into high school,

987
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:32,740
I was doing a lot of sports and
stuff like cross country basketball,

988
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:33,250
track,

989
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,641
everything.

990
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:35,380
Like I just try to be
as active as possible.

991
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:36,161
Try and stay busy.

992
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,660
Cause yeah,

993
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:38,201
I did a little,

994
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:38,860
like one season,

995
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,300
the wrestling as a senior and then,

996
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,260
uh,

997
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,501
you know,

998
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:41,630
I,

999
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,610
I came to,

1000
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,060
I did kickboxing and I met pat at
Duke groups as Jim and Milwaukee.

1001
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:49,700
And then that's kind of where
I saw guys like him at the pet,

1002
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,820
all those dudes like
doing as a profession.

1003
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:52,654
So I was like,

1004
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,730
I mean I could do that
as a profession too,

1005
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,380
you know?

1006
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:55,740
Wow.

1007
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,860
And how old were you at the time?

1008
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,620
So I first walked into Duke Jamal's
I think I was like 14 and then I left

1009
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,470
because I had like other
obligations and like,

1010
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,010
you know,

1011
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,690
stopped training for a while,

1012
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,450
but I was still doing other sports
and stuff and they came back,

1013
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:10,661
you know,

1014
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:11,560
when I was like 17.

1015
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,420
So you were really thinking at that time
like maybe this would be something you

1016
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:17,740
could do for a career.

1017
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,520
Um,

1018
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:18,761
you know,

1019
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:19,541
not for sure,

1020
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:24,541
but like definitely like I
saw I was always going to
be involved in martial arts

1021
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:25,654
no matter what.

1022
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,790
So like as a hobby,

1023
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,700
did you have another thing that you were
thinking of doing before that though?

1024
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,290
Like when you were
thinking about your future?

1025
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,511
Yeah.

1026
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:32,931
I mean,

1027
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:35,150
I knew that I had to
do something for money.

1028
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:39,440
So like I tried a semester of
college and realized it's like,

1029
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,520
this isn't just like high school,

1030
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:41,241
but I'm paying for it.

1031
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:41,931
Like this is stupid.

1032
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:43,040
So I stopped going.

1033
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:43,820
Um,

1034
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,560
I really liked,

1035
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,393
um,

1036
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,900
English and so I thought maybe I
could go and sad or like I said,

1037
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,680
I try and push me into
computers and I was like,

1038
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:52,401
this is stupid.

1039
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:52,580
Like,

1040
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,260
I'm good at.

1041
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,270
I just really doesn't excite me at all.

1042
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,540
And so you're like,

1043
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,360
that sounds a little,

1044
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,120
if she wasn't,

1045
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,620
uh,

1046
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,640
doing more shorts right now,

1047
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:02,941
she'd be,

1048
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:03,930
should I not be touching this?

1049
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,103
I don't know.

1050
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,231
I was just like,

1051
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,320
just weird over there
making a lot of emotion.

1052
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,111
I'm hanging this up,

1053
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:10,600
man.

1054
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,870
I think rose would have been farming.

1055
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:12,910
Yeah.

1056
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,900
So like my,

1057
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:14,734
um,

1058
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,520
yeah,

1059
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,390
that's always been like,

1060
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:17,380
my thing is like,

1061
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,633
uh,

1062
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:18,911
you know,

1063
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:21,610
and they asked us what we want to be
when I grow up is I always said I want to

1064
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,330
be a farmer.

1065
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,890
Like ever since I was a kindergartner.

1066
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,580
Just because you liked the idea of
growing things out of the ground.

1067
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:28,070
And like you were saying before,

1068
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,750
making your own food from scratch and

1069
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,250
yeah.

1070
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,800
A tomato from your garden that you grew
tastes so much better than from the

1071
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:34,350
store.

1072
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,680
Now when you two started hanging out
and pat had already been accomplished

1073
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:42,681
kickboxer who was an MMA fighter and did
that sort of embolden you to the idea?

1074
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,250
Uh,

1075
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,380
oh,

1076
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,800
so the fighting like professionally.

1077
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:46,634
Yeah.

1078
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,331
And then I,

1079
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,500
that's when I saw,

1080
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,040
uh,

1081
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,280
you know,

1082
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,160
Gina Carano end and a
Cyborg finding at the same,

1083
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,140
uh,

1084
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,560
like that big fight that they had.

1085
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,320
And then that's kind of
what inspired me to like,

1086
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,010
I was like,

1087
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,191
oh,

1088
00:23:58,191 --> 00:23:59,630
I can take this to the next level.

1089
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,561
Wow.

1090
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:03,410
The Gina Carano thing that got
a lot of people in the MMA,

1091
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:04,130
right?

1092
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,740
Yeah,

1093
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,300
yeah.

1094
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,200
She was the first,

1095
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,530
a lot of people don't even know
a lot of these kids today that,

1096
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,050
you know,

1097
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,080
know about Ronda Rousey and they
got to introduce into the sport.

1098
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,020
Gina Carano was the original Ronda Rousey.

1099
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,600
She was the one back in the day.

1100
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,021
Yeah.

1101
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:19,100
I liked her a lot.

1102
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,760
Um,

1103
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,061
you know,

1104
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:20,990
she definitely,

1105
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
she broke some barriers,

1106
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:22,641
you know,

1107
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:27,380
and then I would say Rhonda came after
her and took it to like even quadruple

1108
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:27,591
that.

1109
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,280
So,

1110
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,113
um,

1111
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:29,810
it's,

1112
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,643
it's awesome.

1113
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,540
What does it feel like
to be the champ now?

1114
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,830
Because that's a crazy,

1115
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,000
that's a crazy thing.

1116
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,470
It's a crazy thing that happened.

1117
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,790
Fight was insane.

1118
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,160
And if people thought
you were going to win,

1119
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,890
they probably thought you'd win by
submission or maybe by decision,

1120
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,360
but when you cracked her in the first
round and dropped her and put her away and

1121
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,430
then DC starts screaming,

1122
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,413
thug,

1123
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,250
thug grows.

1124
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:52,470
Yeah.

1125
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,770
That was like one of my favorite
times commentating with DC too,

1126
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:56,580
because yeah,

1127
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,070
he just was overcome with emotion.

1128
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:00,330
Just couldn't help it.

1129
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,020
Yeah.

1130
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,853
Um,

1131
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,121
I don't know,

1132
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:03,391
man.

1133
00:25:03,391 --> 00:25:05,610
It's like somebody asked me like,

1134
00:25:05,611 --> 00:25:07,500
what's different since you've been champ?

1135
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:08,071
And I'm like,

1136
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:08,341
really?

1137
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,230
I'm just sitting here trying to
figure out what is different.

1138
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,801
You know,

1139
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,540
like obviously you're
sitting here talking to you,

1140
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:12,691
like,

1141
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:13,440
that's cool,

1142
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,820
but I'm talking to you before.

1143
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,370
Yeah.

1144
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,750
I mean talk to you now that
this crazy thing happened.

1145
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,611
Right,

1146
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:20,210
right.

1147
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,043
Um,

1148
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,771
so yeah,

1149
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,210
I mean things are different,

1150
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:23,421
you know,

1151
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:23,631
like,

1152
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:24,770
I definitely notice more,

1153
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,120
more people,

1154
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:26,960
uh,

1155
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,793
recognizing me.

1156
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,200
Do you have a very unique
look to with your shaved head?

1157
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:30,381
Yeah.

1158
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:33,680
I can't hide or you don't have to
wear a ways to go to the movies.

1159
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:34,010
Right,

1160
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,371
right,

1161
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:34,830
right.

1162
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,520
Yeah.

1163
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,530
And you guys are going
to fight again in April.

1164
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,000
Back in New York.

1165
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,750
Yeah.

1166
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,140
Yeah.

1167
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,811
That'd be cool though.

1168
00:25:40,811 --> 00:25:41,730
Growth come to Brooklyn,

1169
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,520
coming to Brooklyn.

1170
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:43,800
And what,

1171
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,431
when you,

1172
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:45,480
when the fight was over,

1173
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:45,841
what did you,

1174
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,430
what did you take some time off?

1175
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:48,750
Like how did you did it?

1176
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,860
Did it even sink in?

1177
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,551
Oh yeah.

1178
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:51,241
We had to go,

1179
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:52,440
we had to get the fuck out of there.

1180
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:53,280
We had to go home.

1181
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,114
Like,

1182
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,720
um,

1183
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,560
like all of that stuff.

1184
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:56,311
Like the,

1185
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:56,611
you know,

1186
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:56,960
the,

1187
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,670
the truck accident and like
the protests and all this,

1188
00:25:59,700 --> 00:25:59,970
you know,

1189
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,781
paranoid that I had,

1190
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:01,590
I had to,

1191
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,160
um,

1192
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,540
hideaway,

1193
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:02,751
I'm,

1194
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:03,391
I'm a hermit,

1195
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:05,270
so like I like to like to be,

1196
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,540
we went straight to the airport,

1197
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,413
two 30,

1198
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,670
two 30 in the morning or
flight wasn't until at 9:00 AM

1199
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,960
there was gonna be a marathon,

1200
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,500
right?

1201
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:14,681
Yeah.

1202
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:15,210
The next day.

1203
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:15,481
Yeah,

1204
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:16,650
we heard there's going to be a marathon,

1205
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:19,470
but also rose did what she did
and as soon as it happened,

1206
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:19,860
we all went,

1207
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,420
oh fuck.

1208
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:20,891
Oh right.

1209
00:26:20,891 --> 00:26:21,711
Like I robbed a bank.

1210
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:21,821
Like,

1211
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:22,010
oh,

1212
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:22,843
like

1213
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,630
everybody be cool.

1214
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:27,464
Just keep smiling.

1215
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,723
Wow.

1216
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:28,971
Yeah.

1217
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:29,804
That was it.

1218
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:30,230
He's

1219
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,390
like,

1220
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,800
I knew that was going to happen.

1221
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:32,634
Like I actually,

1222
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,713
um,

1223
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,310
I actually envisioned me knocking her
out with like a Burka and the third round

1224
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:41,640
because I thought she's going to be like
overly aggressive after a certain point

1225
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,720
as she would get frustrated.

1226
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,550
That didn't happen cause it,

1227
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,330
you know,

1228
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,020
uh,

1229
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,280
she thought I was throwing a jab,

1230
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,630
but yeah.

1231
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,950
Why do you think that?

1232
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,780
I mean when you went into that fight,

1233
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,760
she was such an overwhelming favorite.

1234
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,140
She was thought of as being one of the
pound for pound top fighters in any way

1235
00:26:59,141 --> 00:26:59,974
class.

1236
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,870
And why did you think that
you're going to knock her out?

1237
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,620
Because everybody tries to take her down.

1238
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Everybody is so desperate for the
take down that it's like her striking,

1239
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,770
I mean this from what I see is,

1240
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,120
I mean I sit across from volunteering
shut Chenko and like we go like back and

1241
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:15,421
forth.

1242
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:16,500
Like it's not a thing to me.

1243
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,370
Like I got Pat Barry,

1244
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:17,900
pat A's,

1245
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,661
you're burying my corner.

1246
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:22,020
I got Trevor Whitman and my
corner and I've done taekwondo.

1247
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,700
A striking like my whole life.

1248
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:26,370
Like it's not something
that I've never seen before.

1249
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:26,581
Right.

1250
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:26,791
You know,

1251
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,030
and just that Dutch style,

1252
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:28,770
like kickboxing,

1253
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,461
like it's great.

1254
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:30,121
It's hard,

1255
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:32,400
it's very intimidating
to send across from,

1256
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,960
but you can,

1257
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,621
you know,

1258
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:36,480
it's very rhythmic on the beat.

1259
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,500
Like it's not,

1260
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,140
I don't know,

1261
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,450
it's,

1262
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,010
it's just something that,

1263
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,181
it looks scary,

1264
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:44,010
but it's not to be scared of,

1265
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,903
you know?

1266
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,790
That's interesting to where you're putting
it because most people thought of her

1267
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:51,430
as being like this very solid.

1268
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,670
Her fundamentals are rock solid.

1269
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,080
She's incredibly technical.

1270
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:55,420
Yeah.

1271
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,470
Vicious Jab.

1272
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,021
Yeah.

1273
00:27:57,021 --> 00:27:57,580
No,

1274
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,430
but you just saw that the
rhythm was predictable.

1275
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,383
I mean,

1276
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,820
we knew everything she was
going to do before she did it,

1277
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,620
watching it for a long time.

1278
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,040
Right.

1279
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,341
You know,

1280
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:06,671
like,

1281
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:07,900
and she is the,

1282
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,890
the like,

1283
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,630
I mean she has the most dominant female.

1284
00:28:10,631 --> 00:28:12,580
Like these girls could not hang with her,

1285
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,473
you know,

1286
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,940
and she's still the best out there,

1287
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,863
you know,

1288
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,260
isn't been on the radar
since she'd be Carla.

1289
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,690
Like we knew that that was the
fight as soon as she'd be calling.

1290
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:24,390
And it was just a matter of
how were we going to get there.

1291
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,430
Like what route are we
going to take to get there?

1292
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:29,550
And so when the fight came around a big,

1293
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,443
a big,

1294
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,261
this whole,

1295
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:32,700
this entire training camp was mental.

1296
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,013
It wasn't physical.

1297
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,750
The whole training camp every
day was mental mentality,

1298
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:37,231
mind,

1299
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:37,621
mental,

1300
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:38,320
mental strength,

1301
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,791
just mental,

1302
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:39,061
mental,

1303
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:39,690
mental.

1304
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,680
The entire training camp.

1305
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,840
And one of the keys to the fight was
knowing what she's going to do before she

1306
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:46,171
does it.

1307
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:46,710
And I mean,

1308
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,700
not just in the fight,

1309
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:48,660
but in the interviews,

1310
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:49,590
in the press conference,

1311
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:50,400
backstage,

1312
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,091
backstage,

1313
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:51,531
like we,

1314
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:51,990
we,

1315
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,070
we knew everything that was going to
happen and it all happened exactly the way

1316
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:56,904
we knew it was coming to.

1317
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,720
Wow.

1318
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,553
Yeah.

1319
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,041
This was,

1320
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:03,000
this was an excellent dissection
of a person of an athlete.

1321
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,910
Now what is the feeling like
having gone through that,

1322
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:06,990
having accomplished it,

1323
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:09,150
having literally blown
it out of the water,

1324
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,471
right?

1325
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:09,580
Yeah.

1326
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,280
Did you smashed in the first round?

1327
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,660
Crazy moment?

1328
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,260
Yeah.

1329
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,340
Now you gotta do it again.

1330
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,201
I know.

1331
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:15,441
Yeah.

1332
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:16,370
That was the tough part.

1333
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:16,760
What's,

1334
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,593
what's the,

1335
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,860
what's the thought process?

1336
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,150
Um,

1337
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:20,720
you know,

1338
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,201
just,

1339
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:22,034
uh,

1340
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,510
you can't make the,

1341
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:23,940
uh,

1342
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,580
what was the saying?

1343
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,020
He always like,

1344
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,853
I don't get messed up,

1345
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,540
but she can't paint the model.

1346
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,131
It's twice,

1347
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:28,431
you know,

1348
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:28,720
like,

1349
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:28,940
right.

1350
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,740
So it can't be the same approach.

1351
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:31,041
You know,

1352
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,140
it has to be something different.

1353
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:33,920
It has to be.

1354
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,520
Um,

1355
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,600
but you know,

1356
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:36,981
at the same time,

1357
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:37,581
and if it ain't broke,

1358
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:38,331
don't fix it either.

1359
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:38,990
So like,

1360
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,141
uh,

1361
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:40,580
it's gotta be a combination of like,

1362
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:40,941
yeah,

1363
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:42,400
we're to keep doing what we're doing,

1364
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:42,790
but,

1365
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,031
you know,

1366
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,040
keep getting better
obviously all the time.

1367
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,261
I mean,

1368
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,940
I sounds a little general cliche.

1369
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,590
We don't prepare for one
in particular person.

1370
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:53,370
It's always were roses on the
road to getting her black belt.

1371
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,361
And that's what the,

1372
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,500
that's what the mission is.

1373
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,131
I mean,

1374
00:29:56,131 --> 00:29:59,880
of course we do get into
particulars based on who it is,

1375
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,070
but that's only for a
very short period of time.

1376
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,680
The whole goal is just to make Rose A.

1377
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,120
Black belt in every,

1378
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:06,781
in grappling,

1379
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:07,261
wrestling,

1380
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:08,094
striking.

1381
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,873
Yeah.

1382
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,721
Everything.

1383
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:10,931
Just,

1384
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:12,070
just become a black belt,

1385
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:13,330
become a master of all of it.

1386
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,523
And that's been

1387
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,460
even another,

1388
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,810
like he was saying the mentality
of this last training camp,

1389
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:20,150
it wasn't just like a,

1390
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:20,881
you know,

1391
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:21,211
okay,

1392
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:21,880
I'm going to,

1393
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,070
I mean,

1394
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,920
a journal,

1395
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,960
which I do during all that are all like,

1396
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,770
you know,

1397
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,110
like we talked about just doing like
a float tank or something like that.

1398
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:29,610
Like those little mental exercise.

1399
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:29,971
They're great,

1400
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:30,810
but also like,

1401
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,963
um,

1402
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,760
uh,

1403
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,920
working on creativity with it.

1404
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,400
I was just doing the number
of ice baths she took.

1405
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,021
Oh yeah.

1406
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:39,220
I did lot ice mass.

1407
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,790
I said,

1408
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,290
yeah.

1409
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,280
Oh the last one was the worst.

1410
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,203
Like I said,

1411
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:43,990
the last,

1412
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,823
every day,

1413
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,390
every day to a point where it actually
became challenging for me to get the

1414
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:49,021
water colder.

1415
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:49,411
Cause I was like,

1416
00:30:49,411 --> 00:30:52,250
this is ridiculous how she
didn't get in and within,

1417
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,320
under now it's gotten to a point
now it had been under 25 seconds.

1418
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:55,591
Like the,

1419
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:55,711
you know,

1420
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:56,290
when you first get it,

1421
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,430
like boom,

1422
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,290
right.

1423
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,470
Like he's under 20 seconds on 20
seconds and she's just stone faced.

1424
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:02,304
It's just amazing.

1425
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,070
Yeah.

1426
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,120
The last one that I did,

1427
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:05,680
like it was hurting so bad.

1428
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:06,790
I was like crying.

1429
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,540
Like I never had either where I
started crying because it hurts a bit.

1430
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,170
But anyway,

1431
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,003
like,

1432
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,461
yeah,

1433
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:13,270
so that,

1434
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,980
and then onto a lot of benefit from that.

1435
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,090
Yeah.

1436
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,930
I do like,

1437
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:18,550
I mean the,

1438
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,073
yeah,

1439
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,580
reduction of inflammation.

1440
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,720
Yeah.

1441
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,680
And there's just like mentally,

1442
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,970
mentally and emotionally to,

1443
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,263
um,

1444
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,981
you know,

1445
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:27,521
cause it's like,

1446
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:28,660
why is it so scary?

1447
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:29,381
But it hurts,

1448
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:30,160
you know?

1449
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,680
Um,

1450
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,210
but it's,

1451
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:31,721
it's good.

1452
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:31,961
I mean,

1453
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:35,170
if you can get in the cold ice baths
and nobody's sitting across from you is

1454
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,004
gonna scare you.

1455
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,650
It was less scary than the cold.

1456
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,311
But,

1457
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:40,144
uh,

1458
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,193
also,

1459
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,530
and I wasn't,

1460
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,690
I was trying to say this the whole time,

1461
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:43,920
but,

1462
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,753
uh,

1463
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:49,810
I've been also getting back into piano
because I used to play piano as a kid and

1464
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,220
I got away from that ever since.

1465
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:54,700
Like moving from state to state and not
having an actual panel just to keyboard.

1466
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,770
It's like stupid trying
to play on a keyboard,

1467
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:58,630
but I finally got a piano in my house.

1468
00:31:58,631 --> 00:32:02,200
And so like that's another thing that I
started incorporating into my training,

1469
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:05,800
just like training my mind and
just be more creative and um,

1470
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,720
just having like outlet too.

1471
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,781
That's interesting.

1472
00:32:08,781 --> 00:32:10,940
So you feel like that benefits you just,

1473
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,200
just being creative on a piano and,

1474
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,173
yeah,

1475
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,530
I think there's a lot of parallels
between music and fighting.

1476
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh yeah,

1477
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,811
I think so too,

1478
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:20,200
pat.

1479
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,190
I don't know.

1480
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,593
I don't,

1481
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,411
well yeah,

1482
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:23,750
he's,

1483
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,470
I was,

1484
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,540
I was classically trained
in piano and jazz,

1485
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,230
um,

1486
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,730
in high school and I was,

1487
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:31,300
uh,

1488
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,570
my mom's a pianist and so like it kind
of runs in the family and so we have been

1489
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,320
doing that as long as I've been doing
martial arts and it's just a good balance,

1490
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:38,561
you know,

1491
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:41,150
just like gardening or
anything like that is to,

1492
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,140
you know,

1493
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,490
fighting and hurting people.

1494
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,141
Well it's weird.

1495
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:44,471
I think it,

1496
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:44,620
it,

1497
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,600
it almost made like almost help with her
body mechanics in a way to be able to

1498
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,500
control an individual finger at different
times in hitting one beat on left hand

1499
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:54,071
in a different,

1500
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:54,641
totally different,

1501
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:55,610
something on the right hand and,

1502
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,710
and to be able to just do that,

1503
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,520
but over and over and over and over again,

1504
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,530
no matter how many times
you play the same song,

1505
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,080
you just keep playing it and you love
playing it like over and over again.

1506
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,093
I think that that,

1507
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:06,491
that,

1508
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:07,030
that put,

1509
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,070
that gives rose like a
cat like balance in a way.

1510
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,151
That's interesting.

1511
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:10,691
If you've seen,

1512
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:10,931
no,

1513
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:13,450
I'm sure you have seen a lot of those
things that people are doing now.

1514
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:14,820
We're a light will go up on a board.

1515
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,650
You have to touch the live like Llama
Chanko does a lot of that stuff.

1516
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,610
Or there's,

1517
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,940
there's these things that are supposed
to like be training your neurocognitive

1518
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,690
function,

1519
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:23,920
right.

1520
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,170
And your ability to
react quickly to things.

1521
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:26,890
Right.

1522
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,570
But there's probably
some parallels in that,

1523
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:29,010
right?

1524
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,843
I would think so.

1525
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,730
I mean like,

1526
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,531
like we said before,

1527
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,030
it's like if you believe in and it works,

1528
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,400
you know?

1529
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,233
Yeah.

1530
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,520
Whatever makes you feel good.

1531
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,460
Like maybe makes you happy too.

1532
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,760
And there is a huge

1533
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,320
idea for the second one who we've,

1534
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,183
we've been seeing the,

1535
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,710
the lights and the touch,

1536
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,250
this and that.

1537
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:43,730
Um,

1538
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,170
and I think for this next fight coming up,

1539
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,800
uh,

1540
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,221
a big,

1541
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:47,054
um,

1542
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,070
roses next evolution in her,

1543
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,330
in her game I think is going
to be kind of like a sniper,

1544
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,164
like accuracy.

1545
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,830
So we have an idea of having rose
punching tennis balls out of the air.

1546
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,960
Have you ever tried that hat?

1547
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:03,883
You know that happened?

1548
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,910
The tennis balls on the hat?

1549
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,813
Yeah.

1550
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,140
I haven't tried that yet.

1551
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,090
Huh?

1552
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,630
Yeah.

1553
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,463
Don't like that.

1554
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,393
You don't like that hat?

1555
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,360
Why?

1556
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,193
I think,

1557
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,300
I don't know.

1558
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:13,541
I mean,

1559
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,350
what's it for accuracy?

1560
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,400
Lama Chanko loves it.

1561
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,570
He does a lot of,

1562
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,650
it was a pretty cool dude.

1563
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:19,100
Yeah.

1564
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,090
I know he's a man at it,

1565
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:20,924
but I,

1566
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,340
in my own opinion,

1567
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:25,520
I think this is staring at this
thing and where's it going?

1568
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,010
Like a double MBA is awesome fluid.

1569
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,780
It's just got that tennis
ball in front of him.

1570
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:30,614
He's being fluid.

1571
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,533
Yeah.

1572
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,230
Can you see him practicing with it?

1573
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:33,451
Yeah.

1574
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:33,831
That's cool.

1575
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:34,430
As your mug man.

1576
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,030
Accuracy.

1577
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,331
Like I said,

1578
00:34:35,331 --> 00:34:35,810
that's,

1579
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,400
that's somewhat of an idea that we'd like.

1580
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,070
We have an idea for this next year,

1581
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:41,450
any camp where we're going
to be launching tennis balls.

1582
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:43,790
I rose and having her punch
balls out of midair but not,

1583
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,683
but not,

1584
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,970
not hitting the ball.

1585
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,480
Right.

1586
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,490
Standing there and throwing jabs as the
ball drops right in front of a booth.

1587
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,650
No punching the ball and light throwing
but throwing real punches versus your

1588
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:56,300
own idea that you came up with.

1589
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:56,540
Yeah,

1590
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,051
I had a dream.

1591
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:57,501
It was weird,

1592
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:57,760
man.

1593
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,070
It was,

1594
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:03,070
I just saw it in and if we throw multiple
balls at you in different ways and she

1595
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:05,510
can like throw a real jab in,

1596
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:06,290
hit a ball,

1597
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:06,800
boom,

1598
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,590
then then she'll be able to,

1599
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,760
I think her reflections for
hitting someone right in the tooth,

1600
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,140
you know,

1601
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,450
while they're moving right.

1602
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,250
He's going to be a ad is more elevated

1603
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,560
and this is like just,

1604
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,040
you know,

1605
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,873
this is like I said,

1606
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,420
we're,

1607
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,590
we always add new stuff,

1608
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:23,950
you know,

1609
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,400
it's like,

1610
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,233
it's never,

1611
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,630
um,

1612
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,570
we don't ever go away from
hitting a freaking bag,

1613
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:28,991
you know,

1614
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:29,980
or do I at work,

1615
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:30,251
you know,

1616
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:32,110
like you got to do things that roadwork.

1617
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,011
Yeah.

1618
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:33,844
I love running.

1619
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:34,923
I love running.

1620
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,410
I,

1621
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:35,621
you know,

1622
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:38,160
I did cross country and track in
high and I was really good at it,

1623
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:38,790
but I think,

1624
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,623
um,

1625
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,820
I was trying to run for the wrong reasons.

1626
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:46,080
Like I was trying to just
get a scholarship and get
out of the house and just go

1627
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:46,500
away,

1628
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:46,831
you know,

1629
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:47,041
like,

1630
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:47,670
so I was like,

1631
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,340
I felt like it was more of a job then.

1632
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:54,000
It was like just for fun and now
I run for fun and it's great.

1633
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:54,510
You know,

1634
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,490
it's just like a,

1635
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,060
um,

1636
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,750
I dunno.

1637
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,500
I think there's a book called
born to run and it's great.

1638
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:02,160
I think,

1639
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,110
I think we're all born
around the middle shoes.

1640
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:04,681
Yeah.

1641
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:06,210
I have some tennis or toe shoes.

1642
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:08,730
Yeah.

1643
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,710
And like my brother,

1644
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,120
like he takes it to an
a whole nother level.

1645
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:14,130
He like does barefoot to be completely,

1646
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:14,281
yeah.

1647
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:14,551
I'm like,

1648
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:15,031
he's crazy,

1649
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:16,530
but I try it a little bit,

1650
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:17,250
but um,

1651
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:17,930
yeah.

1652
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,763
But supposedly,

1653
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,873
uh,

1654
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,840
this is anything,

1655
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,150
I am my brother,

1656
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,331
my brother.

1657
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:27,950
It's a little different and he's
a whole nother level to be though.

1658
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,000
Wow.

1659
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,490
Yeah.

1660
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:29,640
No.

1661
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,200
Who organizes your training camp?

1662
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,780
Does Trevor do it or do you
guys all do it together?

1663
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:34,471
We're all,

1664
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:34,740
uh,

1665
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,460
we're all like a team.

1666
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,450
That's the key to our little circle
is like always having team meetings.

1667
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,040
Everybody being on the same page.

1668
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:43,130
We're not going from one
gym to the other to like,

1669
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,760
you know,

1670
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,250
where this coach don't know really what
I'm doing or what I just did with this

1671
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:47,881
other coach.

1672
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:48,330
Like,

1673
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,750
we're all really good friends
and we all grow together.

1674
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,183
Four of us,

1675
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:53,791
Trevor,

1676
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:54,391
Tony Rose,

1677
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:54,900
me.

1678
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,310
Yeah.

1679
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:55,491
No,

1680
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:56,311
we have teammates.

1681
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:58,710
But the core circle is just for people,

1682
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,900
the people that are in charge of how the
like fight handling as what we like to

1683
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:04,300
call it.

1684
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,831
Because it's like,

1685
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:05,071
I mean,

1686
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:08,250
you don't see flamey whether
they're going to a boxing class,

1687
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,680
you know,

1688
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,540
his voluntariness shift,

1689
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,800
tranquil been Denver now she's not.

1690
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,200
She went back to Texas,

1691
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:14,790
but she,

1692
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,520
what was it last year in January?

1693
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,510
Was it last year?

1694
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,780
Almost all of 2017 is
a phenomenal training.

1695
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,623
Part of

1696
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,420
that was perfect timing.

1697
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:31,080
That was one of the best
things that she's so technical.

1698
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:31,670
Yeah.

1699
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,251
She's so good.

1700
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,150
That check right hook that she
throws is when she fought Holly,

1701
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,010
shot Holly down with a checkbook
and she's got really good Jujitsu.

1702
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,653
It's,

1703
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,723
yeah,

1704
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,830
just grind and

1705
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,050
you submit a Julianna Pena.

1706
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,460
I was like,

1707
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,480
Oh shit.

1708
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,883
Underrated.

1709
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,451
Everybody's scared of her.

1710
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:55,330
Striking her physical strength
too is also very impressive too.

1711
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,640
Or she muscles,

1712
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,340
people built off angry lady,

1713
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,593
you know,

1714
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,500
I like,

1715
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,100
uh,

1716
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,520
she's,

1717
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,370
she's tough and I'm a big fan.

1718
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,180
So,

1719
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,740
um,

1720
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:06,960
you know,

1721
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,100
when I heard that you
were training with her,

1722
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:08,460
I was like,

1723
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,180
Ooh,

1724
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,013
that is,

1725
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,850
you want to sharpen the sword.

1726
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,640
Yeah.

1727
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,650
Iron sharpens iron.

1728
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,551
And I think too,

1729
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:18,000
I think like a lot of girls aren't
used to training with other girls.

1730
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,260
You know,

1731
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,380
where to train with other guys.

1732
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,214
So it's like,

1733
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,250
I think it's essential for us
to get together every once a,

1734
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,350
doesn't have to be all the time,

1735
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,253
you know?

1736
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,950
Cause when a girl gets like,

1737
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,860
if I get you like another girl with
something or she gets me with them,

1738
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:35,380
I get so much more angry at
it then like say if like,

1739
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:35,711
you know,

1740
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:37,270
somebody like powers another dude,

1741
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:38,440
like gets me with some,

1742
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:38,731
you know.

1743
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:38,950
Right,

1744
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,250
right.

1745
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:39,930
Yeah.

1746
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,500
Yeah.

1747
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,420
So when you're doing your camp,

1748
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,340
say how many weeks out you say,

1749
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:45,540
or I can't begins now,

1750
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,430
like say you have this April 7th fight.

1751
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,300
Yeah.

1752
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,710
How many weeks out will you,

1753
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:50,220
uh,

1754
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,200
will you just say it's time to go to war?

1755
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,353
I like,

1756
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,460
I like to close everything off like five
weeks out or like four or five weeks

1757
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:58,611
out.

1758
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:00,850
Like that's like where we hit it hard and

1759
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,900
depends on the scenario and
who it is and where we are.

1760
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,930
Like everything is a day by
day feel like there's no,

1761
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,200
you eat this on fight week and this is
the shake out that we're going to do.

1762
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:11,060
It's gonna be five rounds.

1763
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,330
It's all based on the circumstances.

1764
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:17,290
Like still the last training camp because
we did like three training camps with

1765
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,480
volunteers had Shangle
back to back for her.

1766
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:22,720
Like do things that really
aren't like what I've,

1767
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,520
you know rose was a great training.

1768
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,230
Boarding.

1769
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,531
Yeah.

1770
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:25,990
Like,

1771
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,390
like I,

1772
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,820
this is not the way
that I would try and uh,

1773
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,561
phase her,

1774
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:29,860
you know?

1775
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,190
But yeah,

1776
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,290
certain opponents.

1777
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:32,621
Yeah.

1778
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:36,100
So like just going through all
of that and all those challenges,

1779
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:38,230
I'm going into this last fight,

1780
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,400
we kinda just pulled it back.

1781
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:43,150
Like it was very not
intense at all actually.

1782
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:44,870
It was a lot more
focused on like you said,

1783
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:46,270
the mental part and like doing a lot of,

1784
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,140
you know,

1785
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,160
visualization and like self
awareness kind of exercises.

1786
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,660
Valentine is going to 25 now.

1787
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:53,140
Right?

1788
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,800
Okay.

1789
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:53,951
Yeah.

1790
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:56,410
They should be fighting
in February 3rd so yeah.

1791
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,603
And she's been,

1792
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,790
she's been in Texas I
think training down there.

1793
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,170
So yeah.

1794
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:02,960
And this it,

1795
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,671
like I said it all,

1796
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:06,460
all on feeling we should deal
with Valentino was off camp.

1797
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,550
So that was three training
camps back to back to back.

1798
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:13,810
She had a fight than Valentini came
back and he was just more nonstop in the

1799
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:14,170
way,

1800
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:19,120
the way that Valentina is capable of
doing what she's doing because she trains

1801
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:19,480
like,

1802
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,760
I mean everybody who's
good trains like an animal,

1803
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,770
everybody does 10 oh one yeah.

1804
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,041
Yeah.

1805
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:29,041
You have to tell him 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM
and Pablo sits there and like the roses

1806
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,100
necessarily emulating someone.

1807
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,410
Powell rose,

1808
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,570
go get her go attack attack and if and if,

1809
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,800
and if she's not acting right,

1810
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:39,460
go get pat,

1811
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,040
he'll get her like attack.

1812
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,460
Like it's just nice.

1813
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:43,540
I bet girl is tough man.

1814
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,510
She was one of the biggest blessings
for this training camp to come around.

1815
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,533
Yeah.

1816
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,251
So,

1817
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:50,620
so five weeks out is when
you really get crazy.

1818
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,680
Now having already face you ana and having
defeated her so soundly in the first

1819
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,490
fight is,

1820
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,390
I don't want to ever say that there's a
possibility you could underestimate her

1821
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,200
because obviously she's a very
dangerous and threatening woman,

1822
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,880
but how do you keep it fresh?

1823
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,601
Like how do you,

1824
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:11,980
how do you approach this with the same
sort of intensity and anxiety that you

1825
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:14,770
had in the first fight
that ramped up like your,

1826
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,551
your performance?

1827
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:19,990
I mean that was a big part of how turned
on you were and how tuned in you were.

1828
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:20,780
Yeah.

1829
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,590
Um,

1830
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,281
I've had,

1831
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:23,114
uh,

1832
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,180
I almost get like more pressure
anxiety off of like rematches.

1833
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,310
I mean I have all my other
past experiences to draw from.

1834
00:41:31,311 --> 00:41:32,450
So you know,

1835
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,470
like when I rematched Teesha there was a
lot of lessons learned there and I have

1836
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:40,580
to kind of apply those same lessons to
going forward or like other opponents

1837
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,480
where it could be,

1838
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:44,510
there's many like a list of reasons
to underestimate this person.

1839
00:41:44,511 --> 00:41:45,080
Like,

1840
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,370
I have to remember that,

1841
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,233
um,

1842
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,400
anything can happen at
any moment in any way.

1843
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:49,941
It can be dangerous.

1844
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,050
And then at the end of the day,

1845
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:51,591
you know,

1846
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:52,970
whatever's meant to be is meant to be,

1847
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:53,271
you know,

1848
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:56,600
like I remember one time in the
middle of the training camp,

1849
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,080
I had like,

1850
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,291
you know,

1851
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:59,630
I liked my little Yogi teas
where they like say like little,

1852
00:41:59,650 --> 00:41:59,950
you know,

1853
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,000
saying on it and it was something like,

1854
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,140
if it belongs to you,

1855
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:04,400
it'll come to you or something like that.

1856
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,450
And so it was just like,

1857
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:06,830
Kinda,

1858
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:07,850
that's how I feel about the belt.

1859
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,630
It's like,

1860
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,080
you know,

1861
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,400
don't go chasing the belt,

1862
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,040
you know,

1863
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,260
just Isabelle's meant to be yours.

1864
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,040
It's meant to be yours and do everything
that you can to keep it and do

1865
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:18,590
everything that you can to just
be the best version of you.

1866
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:19,190
But,

1867
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,401
you know,

1868
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:22,580
don't put that pressure on yourself that
I have to be the champion or I have to

1869
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,151
do this,

1870
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:23,421
you know,

1871
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:24,500
cause y'all have to do anything.

1872
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,770
The whole quest has been to see if
like it's just the mentality has been,

1873
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,620
let's see if I'm better
than this next person,

1874
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,360
someone out there is better than me.

1875
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,950
Someone eventually is going,

1876
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:37,120
maybe you want me someone out,

1877
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:37,541
there's better.

1878
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:40,090
We just need to find out who it is
and it might be the next person.

1879
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:43,720
Even if it's someone who we
previously thought it might be her.

1880
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,780
So we have to be as the the most ready
possible because we don't know who that

1881
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:50,120
individual is.

1882
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,120
And I think also like focusing on keeping
the mentality of like being curious

1883
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,000
rather than having a need to
know that you're the best.

1884
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:00,560
Like just being curious
if you're the best.

1885
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,580
I think that's a healthy way to approach
it rather than needing to know like,

1886
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,660
I am better than you.

1887
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:06,494
It's like,

1888
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:06,951
I don't know,

1889
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,240
cause we're all the same.

1890
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:09,950
We're all human beings,

1891
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,251
you know,

1892
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:11,510
like at the end of the day,

1893
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:12,680
like if it's meant to be,

1894
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,573
it's meant to be.

1895
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,830
But you went into that fight
wholly confident that you
were better at than her.

1896
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,553
Yeah.

1897
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,883
You're right.

1898
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,510
Uh,

1899
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:21,871
no.

1900
00:43:21,871 --> 00:43:22,231
I mean,

1901
00:43:22,231 --> 00:43:24,330
I definitely feel like I'm
the better martial artists,

1902
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:24,790
you know,

1903
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,610
better and the better fighter too.

1904
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,703
And it's just,

1905
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:28,580
um,

1906
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:28,810
there,

1907
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:29,160
yeah.

1908
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,090
I have a lot of going for me,

1909
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:32,190
but I just have to
remember these things that,

1910
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:33,670
you know the truth.

1911
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,080
Yeah,

1912
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,800
yeah,

1913
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,180
yeah.

1914
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,013
Stay focused,

1915
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,220
keep stay hungry.

1916
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:37,820
Yeah.

1917
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,070
Now when it comes to
strength and conditioning,

1918
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:40,551
how do you,

1919
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,384
how do you,

1920
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,590
how do you parse that out?

1921
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,341
Like how do you,

1922
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:43,700
uh,

1923
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:43,971
what,

1924
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:47,040
how much time do you spend doing that
versus how much do you spend on skill

1925
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:47,874
work?

1926
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,100
It's almost like almost all scale work.

1927
00:43:51,101 --> 00:43:51,371
I mean,

1928
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:52,270
I shouldn't say all,

1929
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,930
but it's like the strength
and conditioning isn't
something that we like is,

1930
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,100
is on the first,

1931
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,030
on the priority list.

1932
00:43:58,031 --> 00:44:00,850
It's kind of just like if we want to
change it up or do something different,

1933
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,020
like I started doing,

1934
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:02,883
um,

1935
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,053
uh,

1936
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:04,600
sorry,

1937
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,630
we just got our bikes and
that's been fun to do.

1938
00:44:07,631 --> 00:44:08,140
But it's,

1939
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,660
I feel like strength and
conditioning should kind of just be,

1940
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,100
I don't know.

1941
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:12,760
I,

1942
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,031
I'm not,

1943
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:14,380
I don't really believe in all these like,

1944
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,850
like strain the conditioning coach.

1945
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:19,210
I think whatever you believe in is
what you know works for you and that it

1946
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:19,601
works.

1947
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:20,170
Right.

1948
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:20,920
Um,

1949
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,431
but for me,

1950
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:22,750
that's something that I don't really,

1951
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:24,100
I feel like a hamster in a wheel.

1952
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:28,840
If I'm going into like some guy
telling me to do these exercises and,

1953
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,680
and do this station and then go
to this thing for amount of time.

1954
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:32,340
Like I just,

1955
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,031
I want to be free.

1956
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:33,570
Like,

1957
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,140
ah,

1958
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,973
I want to be,

1959
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,401
you know,

1960
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:36,240
running outside,

1961
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,770
I want to do something
that makes me happy.

1962
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:38,290
And like,

1963
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,091
or for example,

1964
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:41,460
like when we went to Indonesia and we,

1965
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:41,820
uh,

1966
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,450
we built or ships for like an entire
month and like we did manual labor.

1967
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,540
Like what is that worth ship?

1968
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,873
It's a,

1969
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,750
it's a self sustaining houses.

1970
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,730
I never of the people know what the fuck.

1971
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:57,580
I think John knows everything
and knows everything.

1972
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,920
I've never known you
to not know something.

1973
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,370
I'm a curious person.

1974
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,243
That's a shift.

1975
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:05,110
Our is a self sustaining house that,

1976
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:05,920
um,

1977
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,620
is built off of lake
recycle materials and uh,

1978
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,430
there's a,

1979
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:14,410
there's a documentary on it called a
garbage warriors and this dude Michael

1980
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:14,411
Reynolds,

1981
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,660
he's in New Mexico and he,

1982
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,420
he fought against
legislation like in there,

1983
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,150
in a community to make a
earthship community and um,

1984
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:23,980
New Mexico.

1985
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,460
Yeah.

1986
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,450
And so he fought,

1987
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:25,640
I don't,

1988
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,950
I can't remember how long it was,

1989
00:45:26,951 --> 00:45:27,520
but like,

1990
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,100
like 40 years or something
crazy like went to court.

1991
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:32,680
Like we need to have
this because you know,

1992
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,330
and they just want to let them,

1993
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:34,811
you know,

1994
00:45:34,811 --> 00:45:36,250
so they eventually got it.

1995
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,800
I think I built the entire
community and it's cool.

1996
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:40,380
You can go there and like
check it out in Taos,

1997
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:40,871
New Mexico.

1998
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:41,260
It's,

1999
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:41,891
it's awesome.

2000
00:45:41,891 --> 00:45:45,430
And you can like rent some and
check it out off grid living.

2001
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,600
It looks like star wars,

2002
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:47,434
like it's ridic

2003
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,850
because it was built into the ground.

2004
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:49,720
Jamie,

2005
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,250
Jamie is going to pull something up.

2006
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:52,660
Oh Jesus Christ.

2007
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,040
Fucking hell cool.

2008
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,430
Yup.

2009
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,120
The coolest.

2010
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,610
Maybe you can have like
occupied in New Mexico.

2011
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,970
I need to check out New Mexico.

2012
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:01,843
Goddammit.

2013
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,120
Let there's know when you're going.

2014
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,330
There's a hot spring that we go through.

2015
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,220
Wow.

2016
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,220
It's cold towels.

2017
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:06,820
You know what?

2018
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,830
We got to go there and
interview Rick Strassman.

2019
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,693
That's where he lives.

2020
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,940
He lives in [inaudible].

2021
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,741
He says all hippies.

2022
00:46:11,741 --> 00:46:14,630
That place is dope picture of that house.

2023
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,530
That house looks fucking bad ass shit.

2024
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,930
The thing is they're not just,

2025
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,370
there's not just built anywhere.

2026
00:46:21,371 --> 00:46:21,941
Like they,

2027
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:22,330
they,

2028
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:27,330
they do some type of coordinated so the
house faces a certain like key direction

2029
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,040
and the sun comes through and keeps the

2030
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,060
like uh,

2031
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,980
monitors a 70 degrees is like,

2032
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,170
like the best possible way.

2033
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:35,700
Yeah.

2034
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,170
They're closing up the interior.

2035
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:39,010
Yup.

2036
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,491
It's cool.

2037
00:46:39,491 --> 00:46:42,490
And it's like you're going
to have aquaponics inside
and they like have banana

2038
00:46:42,491 --> 00:46:44,290
trees growing in the middle of New Mexico,

2039
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:44,770
you know,

2040
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,420
and you can like fish in your living room.

2041
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:47,254
Like

2042
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,170
we'll do shit like that.

2043
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:50,070
That's crazy.

2044
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:50,430
Yeah.

2045
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,630
Fish in your living room.

2046
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,730
I mean you can have like
your like aquaponics,

2047
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:55,620
you know where your fish
are and you got your plants

2048
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,280
and the fish shit fertilizes plants.

2049
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,151
I've seen a lot of that.

2050
00:46:59,151 --> 00:46:59,480
Yeah.

2051
00:46:59,480 --> 00:46:59,841
Wow.

2052
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:00,680
Look at this crazy

2053
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,140
look at that.

2054
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:04,311
And they're built,

2055
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:05,450
they're built into the ground.

2056
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:06,040
So like a,

2057
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,290
they're,

2058
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,580
they're really resistant to,

2059
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:08,750
they're really dope.

2060
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:09,643
You want to move?

2061
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,360
Yeah.

2062
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,640
So we went to Indonesia
and built one of these,

2063
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,330
uh,

2064
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,950
for like 30 days and we did a,

2065
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:18,803
like a whole,

2066
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:18,991
uh,

2067
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:19,561
youtube,

2068
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:21,270
like little video on it and stuff.

2069
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,320
And just crazy.

2070
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,010
Uh,

2071
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:23,460
my,

2072
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,000
my uh,

2073
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,721
Doug Diaries,

2074
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:25,770
I have like a youtube channel.

2075
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,050
I haven't done a thug diaries.

2076
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:28,630
[inaudible] gross.

2077
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:29,463
How'd you that name?

2078
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,283
Um,

2079
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:32,920
how,

2080
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,090
how can you get this thug?

2081
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,530
Because I had to,

2082
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,041
well,

2083
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:38,840
so you know my ice cold stare
and he's Sarah Nono on it.

2084
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,460
That's,

2085
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,320
I've developed that long ago,

2086
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:41,771
you know,

2087
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:43,540
cause I was never a weighty person.

2088
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,670
I never had like a good
comeback for anything,

2089
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:47,640
so I just had to beat people
that I was like those big,

2090
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,470
all right.

2091
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,450
The like scare off like the l series.

2092
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:55,030
So that's kind of where it came from.

2093
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,331
And,

2094
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:55,930
uh,

2095
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:56,350
uh,

2096
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:56,771
my neighbor,

2097
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:58,780
I had some Jamaican neighbors that,

2098
00:47:58,810 --> 00:47:59,020
uh,

2099
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,390
her name is Erica Gibbs and,

2100
00:48:01,391 --> 00:48:01,840
um,

2101
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,710
she always used to be like,

2102
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:05,210
that's the cross right there as you know,

2103
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,040
it's still everybody like test the girls.

2104
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:07,983
We see.

2105
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:08,890
She crazy.

2106
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:09,151
Yeah,

2107
00:48:09,151 --> 00:48:09,420
it does.

2108
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,600
Telling you that is one of my fondest
memories when DC was screaming that out.

2109
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,080
Hey,

2110
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:13,913
yes,

2111
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,070
genuine moment man.

2112
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,300
Oh,

2113
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,370
it was 100% of people gave
him a hard time about that.

2114
00:48:17,371 --> 00:48:17,731
I was like,

2115
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:18,001
dude,

2116
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:19,110
don't ever change that.

2117
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,970
That is one of the things
that makes you amazing.

2118
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,660
The fact that he's common doing
commentary and it's like we're on a couch

2119
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:26,620
together watching the fight at home.

2120
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,133
Whoa.

2121
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,860
Genuine happiness.

2122
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:32,190
Yeah.

2123
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:35,990
It was like he was enjoying that moment
and it's animated and it was just,

2124
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,900
it was so stunning and shocking and
that was his real honest reaction.

2125
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:40,690
Right.

2126
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:41,171
That was cool.

2127
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:41,831
I liked DC,

2128
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:42,700
but yeah,

2129
00:48:42,701 --> 00:48:43,450
so that's,

2130
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,700
that's why I feel like it
strained the conditioning.

2131
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,410
I think that was the best,

2132
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:48,460
uh,

2133
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,130
like as shoveling stuff,

2134
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:53,950
like picking up heavy buckets
and tires and things like that.

2135
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:54,570
Like it,

2136
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:58,360
it made me feel like I was actually
doing something rather than just like a

2137
00:48:58,361 --> 00:48:59,171
hamster on a wheel.

2138
00:48:59,171 --> 00:48:59,621
Just like,

2139
00:48:59,621 --> 00:48:59,891
okay,

2140
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:01,600
I'm working out and I'm
getting in better shape,

2141
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:05,380
but I feel like I could be actually doing
something productive here and getting

2142
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:05,941
muscles too.

2143
00:49:05,941 --> 00:49:06,060
Right.

2144
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,840
So to answer the question and we don't
really do the strength and condition that

2145
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,080
we do isn't like a wouldn't
know was not weightlifting and

2146
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,280
I mean sometimes you know
that if we feel like it,

2147
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:15,114
but you know,

2148
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,950
how do you know when to do it?

2149
00:49:16,951 --> 00:49:18,000
Like say if you're in a camp,

2150
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:20,310
like you say like when do you know when
you want to lift weights or something?

2151
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,510
I mean it like for this last
training camp I barely lifted away.

2152
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,320
I don't think I,

2153
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,620
we hardly ever do like [inaudible] is
more like off season kind of thing.

2154
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:29,771
Like,

2155
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:30,300
if we're just like,

2156
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:30,491
oh,

2157
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:32,050
let's just go to 24 for fun,

2158
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,120
walk around all day with a 40 pound
weight vest on one's shadow boxing,

2159
00:49:35,121 --> 00:49:37,660
shadow vice is the best
workout you could possibly do.

2160
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,440
Because like,

2161
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,770
I think people don't like people
practice hitting pads all the time.

2162
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,730
Um,

2163
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,160
but if you don't ever
practice missing a punch,

2164
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:45,821
you will get tired.

2165
00:49:45,821 --> 00:49:50,380
Like if you throw three punches and
miss right and you never practice it,

2166
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:51,820
you'll be surprised at how tired you are.

2167
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:52,350
Yeah.

2168
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:56,020
Is kind of incredible how tired you get
missing things and it doesn't make sense

2169
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:56,500
to people.

2170
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,840
And if you ask people
shadowbox even professionals,

2171
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,703
they suck.

2172
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,693
It's like,

2173
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:01,261
well,

2174
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:01,600
you know,

2175
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,190
they just don't do it with no emotion.

2176
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:03,401
No.

2177
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,740
Like visualizing like
something in front of you.

2178
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:06,290
Like,

2179
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:06,610
um,

2180
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:07,630
if you ever watched like,

2181
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:08,703
uh,

2182
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,290
my old g Jitsu coach back in Minnesota,

2183
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,360
Greg Nelson favorite,

2184
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,270
watch him shadow box.

2185
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:14,104
He's like,

2186
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,640
he's like fighting people and kill it.

2187
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:16,474
People like,

2188
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,403
yeah,

2189
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:17,700
he's got

2190
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,410
a great video on shadowboxing is Joseph
Valtellina my glory champion and he's

2191
00:50:22,411 --> 00:50:25,200
got a whole series of things
put up on his youtube.

2192
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,460
He's got some great
instructional youtube videos,

2193
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,400
but one of the things that he'd went and
talked about is that you should think

2194
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:32,510
of that as like,

2195
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:33,344
you're fighting,

2196
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:38,470
you should visualize like fighting and
you're going through scenarios in your

2197
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:38,901
head.

2198
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:39,141
You know,

2199
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:41,860
you're checking kicks and
countering with right hands and,

2200
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,970
and delivering techniques.

2201
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:44,900
That's where a lot of people,

2202
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:45,180
they,

2203
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:45,671
I think they,

2204
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:46,011
they,

2205
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:46,490
they,

2206
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:46,761
they,

2207
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:48,740
they forget about the,

2208
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,410
the imagination part of shadowboxing way.

2209
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:51,861
People would like,

2210
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:52,581
they'd leave that out,

2211
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:53,414
they think,

2212
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:53,841
okay,

2213
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:54,330
stand there,

2214
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,220
throw some punches,

2215
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:56,060
throw some kicks,

2216
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:00,020
stretch my tricep twice and then go
to more punches and move my head once.

2217
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:00,854
And that's it.

2218
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,780
They're not actually visualizing someone
in front of you throwing punches and

2219
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:09,050
kicks out you and fighting
back and they're not
visualizing someone reacting to

2220
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:10,370
the punches that you're throwing.

2221
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,390
Yeah.

2222
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,980
And firing back and moving around.

2223
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,330
And uh,

2224
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:15,740
when it comes to shadow boxing up,

2225
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:16,811
that's,

2226
00:51:16,811 --> 00:51:17,120
that's,

2227
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,880
that's what we really are the
conditioning by 40 pound weight vest on,

2228
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,330
walk around all day just so you don't
even do anything will just stay home all

2229
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,081
day with a weight vest on.

2230
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:24,290
One.

2231
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:24,941
Do you do that?

2232
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:25,110
Okay.

2233
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:25,943
Yeah.

2234
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:26,590
Yeah.

2235
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,230
Good dog park bike,

2236
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,113
bike ride.

2237
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,470
Wait versus Nice.

2238
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,333
And um,

2239
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:31,990
what do you,

2240
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,670
what is good about the weight vest?

2241
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,680
What was it was that thing that they
used to get into Dragon Ball Z hyperbolic

2242
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:39,514
time chamber?

2243
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,363
No.

2244
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,573
What was the gravity,

2245
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,630
the gravity thing that they got it.

2246
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,380
Yeah.

2247
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,690
Oh well that's just part of like,

2248
00:51:45,691 --> 00:51:49,020
this is just like such a reoccurring
theme in the Dragon Ball z series is like

2249
00:51:49,021 --> 00:51:50,670
just gravity training and like,

2250
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,860
cause once you take your weight vest off,

2251
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:53,723
you just feel lighter,

2252
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:58,760
can breathe a lot easier if you can get
a costume breathing with a weight vest,

2253
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,550
just sitting on your shoulders all day
and moving around with this thing and

2254
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,384
this just

2255
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:04,341
in Bra.

2256
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:06,410
And then when you take it
off and we take it off,

2257
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:08,240
it's almost like as if
you instantly helium

2258
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,020
do you like you carry like backpacks
and stuff when you go hunting and stuff?

2259
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:11,410
Yeah.

2260
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,243
Yeah.

2261
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,460
The pack that I wear that has a,

2262
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:17,010
a bolt on it for a Olympic plates.

2263
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:18,081
It's called a,

2264
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:21,120
an atlas weight trainer by a
company called a outdoorsman.

2265
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,110
And a,

2266
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:26,370
they make it specifically so that people
could train for hunting scenarios where

2267
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:26,860
you,

2268
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,091
you know,

2269
00:52:27,091 --> 00:52:30,330
you have these heavy packs on so you could
put 90 pounds on your back with these

2270
00:52:30,331 --> 00:52:33,840
plates and it clamps down just like
a regular barbell has a whole locking

2271
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:34,550
mechanism on.

2272
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:34,910
Right.

2273
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,920
But it's a real good backpack word,

2274
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:40,040
like sits on your hips and
connects in and stabilize.

2275
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,570
It's perfectly like tuned into your,

2276
00:52:42,571 --> 00:52:43,100
you know,

2277
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,000
our padded right for your
shoulders and everything.

2278
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:45,951
I mean,

2279
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,550
I'm not like,

2280
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:46,931
like I said,

2281
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:48,800
I'm not trying to be like
against strength conditioning,

2282
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:50,450
but it's just whatever makes you happy.

2283
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:50,601
Like,

2284
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,760
I don't feel happy doing this.

2285
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:53,511
And they like,

2286
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:54,350
I want to do like,

2287
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,161
yeah,

2288
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:56,030
have fun with it too.

2289
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:56,450
Like,

2290
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:56,660
eh,

2291
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,740
but I like manual labor,

2292
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:58,101
you know,

2293
00:52:58,101 --> 00:52:59,150
I like digging holes.

2294
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:00,140
I like getting dirty,

2295
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:01,610
I like being outside kind of thing.

2296
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:02,240
So,

2297
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:02,600
um,

2298
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,280
but I used to power lift like,

2299
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,170
before I got to Colorado.

2300
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,740
Um,

2301
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:06,981
you know,

2302
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:08,390
so that was a great,

2303
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:09,463
um,

2304
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,240
thing for me at the time.

2305
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,590
And I think he's just phases.

2306
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:12,861
You know,

2307
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:14,120
you just do different things.

2308
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:15,980
You always gotta change it up and like,

2309
00:53:15,981 --> 00:53:16,340
uh,

2310
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,070
there was this,

2311
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,230
where were you watching that one?

2312
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:19,230
Uh,

2313
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,560
weightlifting documentary where he's like,

2314
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:22,660
if you can't do it dead lifts,

2315
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:22,851
you know,

2316
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:23,780
there's no point in living.

2317
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:24,660
And I was like,

2318
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,493
yes,

2319
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,090
I mean dead

2320
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:26,821
lifts or the Shit,

2321
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:27,510
you know,

2322
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,850
and squats and just like the basic,

2323
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:30,331
you know,

2324
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:33,570
like power lifting
positions or like movements.

2325
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:36,570
But overall I just like
to like one training camp.

2326
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:37,291
When I fought page,

2327
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:40,980
I literally a the condition
or 40 conditioning exercise.

2328
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:43,110
I would chase my dog for like five,

2329
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:46,050
five minute rounds because she's the
fastest thing ever I could chase there.

2330
00:53:46,051 --> 00:53:46,830
So.

2331
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,011
All right,

2332
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:47,844
thank catcher.

2333
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,270
I mean rocky used to chase chickens,

2334
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:51,520
right?

2335
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,160
Remember that?

2336
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,210
I run with my dog all the time.

2337
00:53:57,211 --> 00:53:58,770
It's fucking dogs are in shape.

2338
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:02,711
No,

2339
00:54:02,711 --> 00:54:02,981
we have,

2340
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:03,251
we have,

2341
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:04,240
we have videos of it.

2342
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:08,170
It's like that's getting ready for a
fight we should do and she's chasing the

2343
00:54:08,171 --> 00:54:08,590
dog.

2344
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:09,290
What else?

2345
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:10,123
She's chasing them.

2346
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:10,451
I mean,

2347
00:54:10,451 --> 00:54:11,260
it shouldn't be,

2348
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,790
it shouldn't be a miserable thing,

2349
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,031
you know,

2350
00:54:13,031 --> 00:54:13,240
like,

2351
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,073
like training camp shit.

2352
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,820
It should be hard work,

2353
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,350
but it should also be fun.

2354
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:17,680
Right.

2355
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:17,921
You know,

2356
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,530
like what,

2357
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:21,940
what the hell am I doing if I'm not having
a good time doing what I love to do?

2358
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:23,290
Like just for money.

2359
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:23,860
Like,

2360
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,041
no,

2361
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:25,080
I want to make sure that I'm,

2362
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:25,450
um,

2363
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:29,710
I'm enjoying myself during these training
camps and making sure that if I didn't

2364
00:54:29,711 --> 00:54:30,400
have this fight,

2365
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,320
would I still be doing this kind of thing.

2366
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,270
I've always said that to
someone that is asked,

2367
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:34,391
like,

2368
00:54:34,391 --> 00:54:35,171
how do I get in shape?

2369
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:35,470
I said,

2370
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:35,621
well,

2371
00:54:35,621 --> 00:54:36,700
if you take martial arts,

2372
00:54:36,701 --> 00:54:38,450
the beautiful thing about
it is you're getting a,

2373
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,490
but you're having fun,

2374
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,110
you're enjoying it,

2375
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:44,740
and then you don't even realize how hard
the work is because you're having fun

2376
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,450
and you're like getting a skill,

2377
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,030
getting a skill,

2378
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:49,240
thinking it's,

2379
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:49,660
Gee,

2380
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,670
Jujitsu and my,

2381
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,240
this is me saying good Jujitsu
is better than lifting weights,

2382
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:56,074
in my opinion.

2383
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:56,700
Costco,

2384
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,700
it because man,

2385
00:54:57,701 --> 00:54:58,150
just,

2386
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,790
just heavyweight with it's,

2387
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,781
it's slow.

2388
00:55:01,781 --> 00:55:03,550
So it's so much static,

2389
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:04,384
whole ride.

2390
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,380
Maybe I'm doing it wrong,

2391
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:10,450
but it's so much data and when I feel
like as if when you get out of it,

2392
00:55:10,451 --> 00:55:15,250
because it's a fun activity because it's
interesting and it's not just 20 now.

2393
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:15,940
I like doing,

2394
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,860
I can hit a set at a
hundred curls right now.

2395
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:18,220
We can,

2396
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,420
I can I lightweights.

2397
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:19,810
Right.

2398
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,940
But good Jujitsu has been,

2399
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,670
that's been just phenomenal man.

2400
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,590
Just like the strength
that you can get from that.

2401
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,640
If you're strong there,

2402
00:55:27,641 --> 00:55:29,530
then you're strong a lot of other places.

2403
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:30,910
And when it comes to roads conditioning,

2404
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:32,110
like rose,

2405
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,310
we,

2406
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:32,710
we,

2407
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:33,070
we just,

2408
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:37,360
we practice functional functional
things like punching harder,

2409
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,830
kicking harder,

2410
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,800
grabbing the dummy and guilty eating it,

2411
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:46,450
squeezing it for a ten second hold
and let negligence above a dummy.

2412
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:47,530
Yeah.

2413
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:48,430
Greg sounds great.

2414
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:53,580
Greg Nelson would walk around with a
scream of stick on his arm and he would

2415
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:58,000
just sit there and Kamora the stick
over and over again against his form and

2416
00:55:58,001 --> 00:56:00,320
just come more this
stick over it and over.

2417
00:56:00,321 --> 00:56:01,870
And we just to practice that technique.

2418
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:04,690
We wondered why this is going on.

2419
00:56:04,691 --> 00:56:06,520
But then if he grabs your arm is,

2420
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:07,250
yeah,

2421
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,370
it's pretty hard to stop.

2422
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:08,640
Well,

2423
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,900
so the reason why my camera got so good
is because like we were literally like

2424
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:16,310
shrimp up and down the Mat
shadowing like shadow boxing,

2425
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:17,150
shadow grappling,

2426
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,343
Camorra's

2427
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,590
Gregson under appreciated guy.

2428
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:24,040
He really is under appreciated guy in

2429
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,930
the world of martial arts.

2430
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,271
Very,

2431
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:26,140
very knowledgeable guy.

2432
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:27,160
Very nice guy too.

2433
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,100
Very knowledgeable that there's,

2434
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,130
that's,

2435
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:35,130
that's one of the guys that that for
sure is one of the guys who you can ask a

2436
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:39,250
question about any type of technique or
anything and not only can he give you

2437
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:42,160
the answer but he can give you the
history behind it and he sits up,

2438
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:45,250
this dude is a martial artists
like out of this world.

2439
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:46,590
And he like it was,

2440
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:46,871
it was,

2441
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:47,201
it was,

2442
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:51,190
it was a big deal bumping into him and
then taking everything that we've liked

2443
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:51,320
that,

2444
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,030
that she's learned from him
and then come to Denver where,

2445
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:57,720
where we met Tony Bacilli
that three of the eye.

2446
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,810
I grabbed coach and then he
took everything that all of the,

2447
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:07,530
the technical things that rose learned
and took that took that to another level

2448
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:08,980
to put some flavor in it.

2449
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,170
Man,

2450
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,270
it just took it to another level.

2451
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,530
It's a good combination because

2452
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,600
martial artists like very
strict and Tony's very like

2453
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:23,680
very creative and just does different
movements and things that you haven't seen

2454
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:24,050
before.

2455
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:24,190
Well,

2456
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,390
I'd like you both to speak to that
because it's very important to me to the

2457
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:29,340
coaches that you get,

2458
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:31,090
the martial arts instructors that you get,

2459
00:57:31,091 --> 00:57:33,070
the people that you run
into there is so critical.

2460
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:34,750
It's so important.

2461
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,430
And they should be praised.

2462
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:39,790
Like if you see a guy like Matt Hume
and could create a mighty mouse,

2463
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:40,720
I mean those,

2464
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,553
those people,

2465
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,000
they're so rare.

2466
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:46,780
It's like they're so valuable and you
got to get that connection with that.

2467
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,590
That's important to find the right fit,

2468
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,730
find the compatibility.

2469
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:52,480
And um,

2470
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,380
so I think that's why you see some people
bouncing around because it's just lay

2471
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,250
down really vibe with this place,

2472
00:57:57,251 --> 00:57:57,470
you know,

2473
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,240
or you don't vibe with
the community though.

2474
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,370
The town that you're in,

2475
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:00,611
you know,

2476
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,620
maybe you don't want to live in this city.

2477
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:04,480
And so you try all
Denver for a little bit,

2478
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,700
or maybe maybe Milwaukee is your spot.

2479
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:06,941
You know,

2480
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,970
it's like there's so many different
alternatives and there's so many different

2481
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:11,410
styles that people have.

2482
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,240
Like for some people,

2483
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:13,481
you know,

2484
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:16,180
American top team would be
the spot for some people,

2485
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:16,541
you know,

2486
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:19,540
maybe they should try Montreal
and go up to see for us a hobby.

2487
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:19,780
You know,

2488
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,060
it's,

2489
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:20,893
it's,

2490
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:21,580
it's,

2491
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,840
we're so fortunate now,

2492
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:27,310
I think that there's so many places to
choose from where you can you go to John

2493
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:28,720
crunched down in Arizona,

2494
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:29,321
you know,

2495
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:30,190
he'd go to the lab,

2496
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:30,881
you can go to,

2497
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:31,160
you know,

2498
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,710
Duke Roufus in Milwaukee,

2499
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:33,161
you can go,

2500
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:34,600
there's so many places now.

2501
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:34,840
It's so,

2502
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,330
it's amazing to find your flavor.

2503
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:37,811
Like there's,

2504
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:39,220
there's some places where you go,

2505
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,330
there's some gyms that you go to in the,

2506
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:41,621
the,

2507
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:44,650
the training of the gym consists of
who shows up to practice that day.

2508
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,461
And it's just like,

2509
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:45,641
all right,

2510
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:45,971
everybody,

2511
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:48,870
we're working on single legs
and just go and just find,

2512
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,451
you know what I mean?

2513
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:52,030
So you get better based on who showed up,

2514
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,500
like all your teammates I showed up.

2515
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:54,220
And then there's,

2516
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,110
there's the coaches where
they're very one on one ish.

2517
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,600
Like Matt human created a Demetrius
Johnson like Trevor Whitman is,

2518
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,673
is,

2519
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:07,670
is good enough to take an individual
and make them an individual versus all

2520
00:59:07,671 --> 00:59:07,811
right,

2521
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:08,501
everyone in the room,

2522
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:10,180
we're all going to throw
this one job and that's it.

2523
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:11,560
Like he's very,

2524
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:12,790
very specific and can make,

2525
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:13,420
he can,

2526
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,830
he can find what you're good at
and help you become an individual,

2527
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,210
like I say in the gym.

2528
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:19,970
Yeah.

2529
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:24,970
And maybe his style is
perfectly matched for you and,

2530
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:27,410
but it might not be perfectly
matched for somebody else.

2531
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:28,010
And it's,

2532
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,070
it's such an interesting relationship
between trainers and fighters.

2533
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:31,790
And um,

2534
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:32,340
and the,

2535
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,930
it really bums me out is how
sometimes fighters forget it.

2536
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:37,880
Just forget what got them
there and they forget.

2537
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,020
They think it's all about them.

2538
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:42,320
And it's such a selfish sport and a lot
of ways because it's really only you in

2539
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:43,120
there.

2540
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:43,361
Yeah.

2541
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:44,740
I mean they like,

2542
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:45,821
I mean,

2543
00:59:45,821 --> 00:59:47,200
they've been in so many training camps,

2544
00:59:47,201 --> 00:59:48,640
like literally pat has a,

2545
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:51,550
a meniscus surgery that
he needs to get fixed,

2546
00:59:51,551 --> 00:59:51,851
you know,

2547
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:52,900
and it's like they go,

2548
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,350
they beat up their bodies
just as much as we do to yeah.

2549
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:56,470
To train with us.

2550
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:57,520
And I especially in,

2551
00:59:57,521 --> 00:59:58,060
um,

2552
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,550
in my situation where it
is like fight handling it,

2553
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:01,660
it is like very,

2554
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:01,960
um,

2555
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,850
one on one kind of a deal where it's
not like I have hundreds of training

2556
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:07,900
partners and I go to this,

2557
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,350
you know,

2558
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:09,430
like att for example,

2559
01:00:09,431 --> 01:00:11,280
they have like hundreds
of people there and,

2560
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,243
um,

2561
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:12,611
you know,

2562
01:00:12,611 --> 01:00:14,140
like I just have these guys,

2563
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:14,620
so,

2564
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,010
right.

2565
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:15,843
Yeah.

2566
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,770
So it's good to appreciate your coaching.

2567
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:18,701
It really is,

2568
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:19,040
you know,

2569
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,511
really is.

2570
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:19,721
It's,

2571
01:00:19,721 --> 01:00:20,440
um,

2572
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,221
it's a,

2573
01:00:21,221 --> 01:00:22,840
it's such an unusual relationship,

2574
01:00:22,841 --> 01:00:24,580
the relationship between
a fighter and a coach.

2575
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,443
It's a,

2576
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,170
yeah.

2577
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:26,471
I mean,

2578
01:00:26,471 --> 01:00:27,010
like I,

2579
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:27,460
once I,

2580
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,450
once I finally,

2581
01:00:28,451 --> 01:00:29,284
um,

2582
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:29,891
you know,

2583
01:00:29,891 --> 01:00:33,130
once I finally went through kind of
just my different learning lessons,

2584
01:00:33,131 --> 01:00:34,180
like after I fought Caroline,

2585
01:00:34,181 --> 01:00:35,380
I didn't have him in my corner.

2586
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,040
And like,

2587
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:36,850
after,

2588
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,170
like I realize that was,

2589
01:00:38,171 --> 01:00:38,470
you know,

2590
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:39,820
the missing link and we,

2591
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,490
it's just something that I've realized,

2592
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:43,421
you know,

2593
01:00:43,421 --> 01:00:45,670
if I can't do it with these guys
and I don't want to do it no more,

2594
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:46,180
you know,

2595
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:46,661
cause it's just,

2596
01:00:46,661 --> 01:00:47,860
it's all about being happy.

2597
01:00:47,861 --> 01:00:48,550
It's all about,

2598
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:49,120
um,

2599
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:49,960
what makes you happy.

2600
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:50,291
I mean,

2601
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:54,700
you ever notice how like kids never get
tired or like they can just run around

2602
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:58,180
in circles for forever and it's
because they're having fun doing it.

2603
01:00:58,181 --> 01:00:58,780
And so that's the,

2604
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,280
that's where the training is based,

2605
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:00,611
is like,

2606
01:01:00,611 --> 01:01:01,140
whatever it takes,

2607
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,973
she happy.

2608
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:05,610
Now when you look at
your future and you say,

2609
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,720
I'm the champ now,

2610
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,450
do you have a roadmap that you have?

2611
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:10,350
Like,

2612
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,090
I want to retire in 10 years,

2613
01:01:12,091 --> 01:01:13,200
I want to get this,

2614
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:14,640
I want to accomplish these things.

2615
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:15,990
Do you have anything like that or you just

2616
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:16,840
my,

2617
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,161
yeah,

2618
01:01:17,161 --> 01:01:17,661
like I,

2619
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:21,180
I like to have a plan and then
if things change and you know,

2620
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,043
that's fine.

2621
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:22,521
You know,

2622
01:01:22,521 --> 01:01:24,150
you have to be able to adapt.

2623
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:25,403
Um,

2624
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:29,340
I plan on not fighting longer
than five years from now.

2625
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,150
I know.

2626
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,520
Yeah.

2627
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,353
How old are you now?

2628
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,430
25 so 30 that's a wrap.

2629
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:33,970
Yeah.

2630
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:34,500
I don't want to,

2631
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,111
if any of my thoughts,

2632
01:01:35,111 --> 01:01:35,411
I mean,

2633
01:01:35,411 --> 01:01:35,770
I could,

2634
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:36,041
you know,

2635
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,540
by the time that comes around,

2636
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:37,840
like,

2637
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,680
like time flies.

2638
01:01:38,681 --> 01:01:40,570
Like I could be their
ears old and be like,

2639
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,730
fuck yeah.

2640
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:43,703
Well it's also,

2641
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:44,170
oh,

2642
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,140
you have the potential to
be a fucking huge star.

2643
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,040
Yeah.

2644
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:48,873
I mean,

2645
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,380
I don't want to freak you out,

2646
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,110
but you're,

2647
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,810
you're this journey.

2648
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,660
You're a very unique person and
you're this very strange time in,

2649
01:01:57,661 --> 01:01:59,790
in history where it's,

2650
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:01,360
I don't want us to freak you out,

2651
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:04,090
but I think the sport
needs someone like you.

2652
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:04,721
Yeah.

2653
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,230
I really think your unique perspective
or a very unique individual and I think

2654
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:09,160
that perspective,

2655
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:12,520
I think we can help a lot of
people to recognize that there's a,

2656
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:13,120
there's a,

2657
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:18,120
a broad spectrum of people out there that
are doing this and that your genuine,

2658
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:24,640
you're genuine behavior and thought
process and how in depth your thought

2659
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:25,531
process is.

2660
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:26,310
I think it's very,

2661
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,070
it's very important

2662
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:27,820
right now.

2663
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,601
I think it is important,

2664
01:02:28,601 --> 01:02:30,190
especially for women too and you know,

2665
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,083
cause uh,

2666
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:34,900
to have a tendency to be pretty
catty and bitchy towards each other.

2667
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:35,651
And I think that,

2668
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:36,160
um,

2669
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,160
if I can show an example to other women
to be more loving to each other and not

2670
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:41,710
just,

2671
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:42,010
you know,

2672
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,920
a woman to woman but to
each other man or woman,

2673
01:02:44,921 --> 01:02:45,340
it just,

2674
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:45,660
it's,

2675
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:45,911
uh,

2676
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:46,900
I think it's important.

2677
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,090
Um,

2678
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:48,511
it also,

2679
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:49,980
the way you shave your head,

2680
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:51,030
you wearing sweat pants,

2681
01:02:51,031 --> 01:02:51,864
you don't give a fuck

2682
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,060
that,

2683
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,050
but you're still beautiful.

2684
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:57,780
I mean that's an important in
Europe also beautiful person,

2685
01:02:57,781 --> 01:03:00,150
like your personality
and I think that that's,

2686
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,430
that's so that's so needed right now.

2687
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,563
Thank you.

2688
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:04,500
It was always like,

2689
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,101
like in,

2690
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:05,401
in,

2691
01:03:05,401 --> 01:03:06,001
in time,

2692
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:08,900
there's always dark times and
there's light times as dark times.

2693
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:09,734
And we've been,

2694
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,570
uh,

2695
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,750
in the world in general
for the last few years,

2696
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:13,584
it's been kind of,

2697
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,180
things have been kind of whack.

2698
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:17,250
People are wearing more
sunglasses at night,

2699
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,230
the fighters are getting more ridiculous.

2700
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:19,860
It's just,

2701
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:20,550
yeah.

2702
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,750
And I feel like as if,

2703
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,920
not that we've hit a seriously low point,

2704
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:27,630
but things have gotten pretty whack.

2705
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:30,840
And I have the feeling that
after that performance,

2706
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:32,280
like after what she did
and when she said that,

2707
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:36,570
that was like a spark of the
beginning of things coming,

2708
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:37,240
coming,

2709
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:37,900
coming back,

2710
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,790
coming back up.

2711
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:41,790
Like just things being a
little bit more not so,

2712
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,100
like not so fucking ridiculous.

2713
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:44,491
Like I said,

2714
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,320
everybody's got their sunglasses on,

2715
01:03:46,321 --> 01:03:49,140
everybody's showing up with a leather
jacket with no shirt on under it.

2716
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:49,974
Everybody's,

2717
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,970
everybody's like talking crazy
shit and just being ridiculous,

2718
01:03:53,971 --> 01:03:54,600
man.

2719
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:54,781
Well,

2720
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:56,100
Connor kind of changed the game.

2721
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:56,330
Right,

2722
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:56,840
right,

2723
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,050
right.

2724
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:57,350
Yeah.

2725
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:00,990
I mean the time to let everybody
know how valuable shit talking is now

2726
01:04:00,991 --> 01:04:02,340
everybody's gonna be wearing these pants.

2727
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,213
Yeah.

2728
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,233
So,

2729
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:07,651
I mean it's,

2730
01:04:07,651 --> 01:04:08,310
it's,

2731
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:09,001
it seemed to me,

2732
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:09,571
I mean this is,

2733
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:10,080
uh,

2734
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,340
just my take on it.

2735
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,900
I feel like the UFC missed
out with Amanda Nunez.

2736
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:16,190
They,

2737
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:16,590
they,

2738
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,080
when they were marketing
Ronda Rousey for that fight,

2739
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:19,921
first of all,

2740
01:04:19,921 --> 01:04:20,611
I was looking at it,

2741
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:21,031
I was like,

2742
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:23,520
this is all Ronda Rousey
and she is facing,

2743
01:04:23,521 --> 01:04:24,241
in my opinion,

2744
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:25,860
the worst possible matchup.

2745
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:27,143
Brazilian Jujitsu,

2746
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:30,490
black belt who hits like
a fucking truck and uh,

2747
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,640
a real tested warrior.

2748
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,190
Yeah.

2749
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:34,260
He didn't get promoted.

2750
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:35,220
They didn't promote it.

2751
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:35,531
They may,

2752
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:37,500
they promoted the Ronda Rousey thing,

2753
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:40,980
the Ronda Rousey comeback back and her
walking around her mansion frowning.

2754
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:41,970
Like she's coming back,

2755
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,340
she's coming back to
fight a fucking killer.

2756
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,190
Yeah.

2757
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,730
And why not promote the killer?

2758
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,830
Like this woman is Merkin people,

2759
01:04:49,831 --> 01:04:50,240
the group,

2760
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,860
what she did to me should take a
look at what she's doing to people.

2761
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:57,210
She's blasting people into
orbit and then she wins.

2762
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:02,450
And you have this opportunity of the very
first gay woman who is a mixed martial

2763
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:04,350
arts UFC champion first,

2764
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:05,213
first one ever.

2765
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,113
Right.

2766
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:07,320
This is not no big,

2767
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,333
no big push.

2768
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,180
Yeah.

2769
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,590
But that also could mean from what,

2770
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:14,100
from what we've just discovered over the
last three months that it could also be

2771
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:14,934
Amanda though.

2772
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:19,540
Like we left New York that
night and no one talk.

2773
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,300
Nothing was different for two months,

2774
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:22,600
Bro.

2775
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:22,751
Yeah,

2776
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:24,940
but we created that
ourselves when we did that.

2777
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:28,600
We went home and we looked out the window
for two months trying to figure out

2778
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:29,560
who's walking down the street.

2779
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:30,400
I mean we,

2780
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:30,660
we,

2781
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:30,901
we,

2782
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:31,810
we shut it down.

2783
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:35,050
They want it rose to instantly going
to a victory tour across New York.

2784
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:37,750
They want us to stay in New York like
after that whole week in New York,

2785
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:37,931
they,

2786
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:39,100
after the fight they say,

2787
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,170
we want you to stay in New York.

2788
01:05:40,171 --> 01:05:41,080
Do you won a victory tour?

2789
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:41,710
And I,

2790
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:42,520
I had to,

2791
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:42,940
I was like,

2792
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,630
no way.

2793
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:44,381
Absolutely not.

2794
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:44,950
We have to go,

2795
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:45,491
we have to leave.

2796
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:46,810
We're not only do we have to leave,

2797
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:50,050
we're leaving right now to think that
there was some benefit in doing a victory

2798
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:52,290
tour of doing a bunch
of different television.

2799
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,170
I,

2800
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:53,350
no,

2801
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:53,491
no.

2802
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:58,491
I feel like I might have like I don't
know what I would have even said in the

2803
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:02,310
interviews at that time cause it was just
like still processing [inaudible] been

2804
01:06:02,311 --> 01:06:02,820
a good time.

2805
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:05,370
But I think that's one of the things
that people would like to see.

2806
01:06:05,371 --> 01:06:06,690
You try to process it.

2807
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:07,763
Yeah I know

2808
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:10,550
people want to do it.

2809
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,790
They were going to see rose do this.

2810
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,131
But I,

2811
01:06:13,131 --> 01:06:14,070
I honestly think

2812
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:16,670
in that circumstance it's
critical who you talk to.

2813
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:16,940
Yeah.

2814
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:21,940
Cause you can be talking to some fucking
normal morning show dummy and then I'll

2815
01:06:22,261 --> 01:06:24,920
give a shit about the sport and they're
going to ask you stupid questions.

2816
01:06:24,921 --> 01:06:26,150
You're only on for five minutes.

2817
01:06:26,151 --> 01:06:26,421
You're like,

2818
01:06:26,421 --> 01:06:26,961
well you know,

2819
01:06:26,961 --> 01:06:27,860
hey it all worked out.

2820
01:06:27,861 --> 01:06:28,694
Hey

2821
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,800
thank you know a wave at the camera.

2822
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,180
But looking back in hindsight,

2823
01:06:33,181 --> 01:06:36,630
I wish I could have like a took it in a
little bit more but it was kind of like,

2824
01:06:36,631 --> 01:06:36,841
okay,

2825
01:06:36,841 --> 01:06:37,320
next fight.

2826
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:37,981
Like you know what I mean?

2827
01:06:37,981 --> 01:06:39,030
It's just like everything is there.

2828
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:39,631
Then we were like,

2829
01:06:39,631 --> 01:06:40,500
okay let's get out of here.

2830
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:42,101
And we,

2831
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:42,461
the we,

2832
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:42,881
we all,

2833
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:43,271
we all,

2834
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:43,391
we,

2835
01:06:43,391 --> 01:06:43,991
we stood up,

2836
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:44,801
we shook hands and we said,

2837
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:46,480
everybody knows everybody would be cool.

2838
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,430
We just got to get the
fuck we got to get home.

2839
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,091
I got to say,

2840
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:49,410
I like it

2841
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:50,243
that too though.

2842
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:50,880
Yeah.

2843
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,780
I liked that approach to
get the fuck out of dot.

2844
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,673
Yeah.

2845
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,070
Like,

2846
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:55,500
so,

2847
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,540
so in our entire relationship,

2848
01:06:57,541 --> 01:06:59,790
like pet has had to learn this over time,

2849
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:01,230
that like if I get,

2850
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:02,190
uh,

2851
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:03,820
the instinct to rose,

2852
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,190
you got to really need a bus out.

2853
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,083
Like I,

2854
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:07,320
you have to listen to me.

2855
01:07:07,321 --> 01:07:07,560
Like,

2856
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,460
now's the time to go.

2857
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:08,871
You know,

2858
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:09,030
like,

2859
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,020
I'll just get this feeling.

2860
01:07:10,021 --> 01:07:10,381
I'm like,

2861
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:11,340
something will happen.

2862
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,890
Like we're leaving occurrences

2863
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:13,500
who's,

2864
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,340
his intuition has been spot on a,

2865
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:15,521
Yo,

2866
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:16,960
we gotta get the fuck
out of here right now.

2867
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,441
And we're like,

2868
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:17,741
all right,

2869
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:17,951
cool.

2870
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,030
So there's no question.

2871
01:07:19,031 --> 01:07:20,320
And now there's no question anymore.

2872
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,420
If Rose said right now we out we dry,

2873
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:24,881
we really,

2874
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:25,470
we call it a,

2875
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:29,650
everybody knows it's a countdown and Rosay
let's bounce ten nine and we're going

2876
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:31,960
to launch the last time she did this,

2877
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:33,003
wait,

2878
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:34,780
we gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

2879
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,310
We were leaving.

2880
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:36,641
There was the,

2881
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:39,000
one of the first times we
had going out to a nightclub,

2882
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:39,491
they're like,

2883
01:07:39,491 --> 01:07:41,950
we've been saying for three years.

2884
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:43,330
Then like eventually Valentino,

2885
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:44,530
like one her fight in Denver.

2886
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:44,990
So we're like,

2887
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:45,823
what you going?

2888
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:46,511
I go outside,

2889
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:46,841
I will,

2890
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:47,674
will you want to do it?

2891
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:48,551
We're going to do it.

2892
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:49,350
Then we went out to,

2893
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:49,520
again,

2894
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,830
it was fun and we danced and for years
we haven't gone to anytime it doesn't,

2895
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:53,591
we danced,

2896
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:56,380
it was great and everybody had a great
time and then all of a sudden out of

2897
01:07:56,381 --> 01:07:57,040
nowhere,

2898
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,510
1231 row says,

2899
01:07:59,110 --> 01:07:59,370
you know,

2900
01:07:59,370 --> 01:07:59,800
we got it.

2901
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,880
Let's get the fuck Outta here.

2902
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,700
And it's instant is the instant change
of the feeling around one o'clock.

2903
01:08:04,701 --> 01:08:05,121
Or if somebody say,

2904
01:08:05,121 --> 01:08:05,261
look,

2905
01:08:05,261 --> 01:08:06,220
we gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

2906
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,060
And within,

2907
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,370
within a minute we had
eight people were grabbing.

2908
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:09,830
People come with this,

2909
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:10,150
let's go,

2910
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,590
let's go from the gym.

2911
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,320
How you getting home?

2912
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:16,310
Come with us like the get in the van and
we walked through the down the stairs

2913
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,700
past this really big guy that was by
the front door arguing with the security

2914
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:20,120
guy,

2915
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:20,420
right?

2916
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,530
Pessoa excuse me sir.

2917
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,311
Right past him.

2918
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:25,070
And as soon as we got past him he
started shooting everybody pop,

2919
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:25,261
pop,

2920
01:08:25,261 --> 01:08:25,421
pop,

2921
01:08:25,421 --> 01:08:25,571
pop,

2922
01:08:25,571 --> 01:08:25,730
pop,

2923
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:25,931
pop.

2924
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:27,470
Like he just started shooting everybody.

2925
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,220
Wow.

2926
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:28,731
It's been,

2927
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:31,610
it's been instances
like this where Rosanne,

2928
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,750
where the gun was going off,

2929
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:33,380
pop,

2930
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:33,711
pop,

2931
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:34,251
pop out.

2932
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:35,510
And then not only that,

2933
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,540
but we got in the van and everybody
fucking don't move the dude,

2934
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:38,990
they,

2935
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,410
he walked to the car that was
parked right in front of us.

2936
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,920
Like we were parked like
this chick where in the van,

2937
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,690
the Schick runs up to the door.

2938
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,330
She's scrambling trying to get
in his guys casually walking.

2939
01:08:50,331 --> 01:08:51,320
We don't know what's going on.

2940
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:52,310
He just casually walking around.

2941
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:53,000
We just see this guy.

2942
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,811
He opens up the door,

2943
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:54,411
pulls a gun out.

2944
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:55,060
She was,

2945
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:55,730
oh,

2946
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:56,460
shoots her.

2947
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:56,650
No,

2948
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:56,920
no,

2949
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:57,340
no,

2950
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:57,560
no,

2951
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,260
no.

2952
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,000
She's old.

2953
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,833
She was living

2954
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:00,460
Nicola,

2955
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:02,930
she was having an argument
with the doorman I think.

2956
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:03,090
Yeah.

2957
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:04,730
Because they weren't letting
him in or something like that.

2958
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:05,990
So he's just started shooting pow,

2959
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:06,410
POW,

2960
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:06,770
POW,

2961
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:07,101
pow.

2962
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,640
And then he walked to his car and
then when he got his coat he said,

2963
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:09,980
Huh,

2964
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:10,280
Huh,

2965
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,113
put the gun up again.

2966
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,180
He hit him more to do and then got in
the car and they just casually drove off.

2967
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,920
[inaudible] that we're on is like,

2968
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:17,910
I,

2969
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:18,360
yeah,

2970
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,193
I,

2971
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:19,891
I like,

2972
01:09:19,891 --> 01:09:21,240
I will call it like instantly.

2973
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:24,030
Like you just think you
have very good intuition.

2974
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,890
Just seen stuff like that,

2975
01:09:25,891 --> 01:09:26,161
you know?

2976
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:26,470
Like I,

2977
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:27,303
I will,

2978
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,450
I just can feel the energy
of a room like change,

2979
01:09:30,451 --> 01:09:31,284
like,

2980
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:31,830
um,

2981
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:32,131
you know,

2982
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:34,700
when I was a kid and we was
just playing basketball and,

2983
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:35,221
and it's like,

2984
01:09:35,221 --> 01:09:37,260
it's weird how nobody
else will pick up on it.

2985
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:38,090
Like,

2986
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,210
except for myself,

2987
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,110
you know?

2988
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:40,943
Um,

2989
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,570
in those situations,

2990
01:09:42,571 --> 01:09:45,150
like I was playing basketball with my
friends and then like down the street,

2991
01:09:45,151 --> 01:09:47,670
I thought I heard something
in a distance that like,

2992
01:09:47,671 --> 01:09:47,881
you know,

2993
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:48,840
just people talking,

2994
01:09:48,841 --> 01:09:49,230
but it,

2995
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,390
or some like people making noises.

2996
01:09:51,391 --> 01:09:52,224
But I didn't,

2997
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,741
you know,

2998
01:09:52,741 --> 01:09:53,040
there's,

2999
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,651
there's always nice,

3000
01:09:53,651 --> 01:09:54,391
we're in the middle of the city,

3001
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:54,601
you know,

3002
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:57,570
but for some reason my attention
was brought to this noise,

3003
01:09:57,571 --> 01:09:58,680
like it's something's wrong.

3004
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,880
So I look and I'm like,

3005
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,490
and I think I see some people
wrestling over there or something.

3006
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:03,480
And then you know,

3007
01:10:03,481 --> 01:10:04,200
my friends like,

3008
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:04,561
oh no,

3009
01:10:04,561 --> 01:10:04,891
it's probably,

3010
01:10:04,891 --> 01:10:05,521
they're probably cool.

3011
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:06,061
What are you talking about?

3012
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:06,600
And I was like,

3013
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,740
I'm gonna go over there and check it out.

3014
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:08,171
And it's like,

3015
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:08,520
uh,

3016
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:08,761
you know,

3017
01:10:08,761 --> 01:10:11,040
run across the street
a couple blocks down.

3018
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,430
And then like also,

3019
01:10:12,431 --> 01:10:14,490
and I see a guy have
a knife and stabs him,

3020
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:15,091
you know,

3021
01:10:15,091 --> 01:10:18,390
and then he falls down and he like
turns towards me and then I'm like,

3022
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,501
oh shit.

3023
01:10:19,501 --> 01:10:19,771
You know,

3024
01:10:19,771 --> 01:10:21,240
so and then I realized that my,

3025
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,530
my little like,

3026
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:23,251
dude,

3027
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:23,610
that I,

3028
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:26,130
that I would like help
raise like as a kid,

3029
01:10:26,131 --> 01:10:27,060
cause he was like young as,

3030
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:28,170
as well as myself,

3031
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,430
I think it was Matthew.

3032
01:10:29,431 --> 01:10:31,230
And then I saw him follow me over here.

3033
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:32,340
And so I thought it was the only one.

3034
01:10:32,341 --> 01:10:32,880
So I was like,

3035
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,181
Oh shit,

3036
01:10:33,181 --> 01:10:34,014
I'm happy you go home.

3037
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:34,381
You know,

3038
01:10:34,381 --> 01:10:34,890
like,

3039
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:39,150
so we had the run and then he ended
up just driving off or whatever.

3040
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,530
I don't know if they
found the guy or whatever,

3041
01:10:40,531 --> 01:10:41,760
but um

3042
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,300
hmm.

3043
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,111
Rosa says shit,

3044
01:10:43,111 --> 01:10:44,840
like we're on the highway
driving on a road trip.

3045
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:45,091
She's like,

3046
01:10:45,091 --> 01:10:45,690
get off right here.

3047
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:46,440
Like just quick get over it.

3048
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,330
You go to start getting off in the car,

3049
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:49,164
flips over.

3050
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:50,700
It's spooky.

3051
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,391
I don't question it.

3052
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,260
I don't question it anymore.

3053
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,241
And then it just like,

3054
01:10:53,241 --> 01:10:53,541
you know,

3055
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:54,790
just like the whole thing with the,

3056
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,120
with the truck driving an accident,

3057
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:57,980
like that type of stuff.

3058
01:10:57,981 --> 01:10:59,570
Like it's just seems like,

3059
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:01,483
I dunno,

3060
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:01,950
like,

3061
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,200
and that's why I always believed,

3062
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:06,320
believed in the fact that if you're
delayed or you're late for something,

3063
01:11:06,321 --> 01:11:07,154
it's for a reason.

3064
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:07,641
You know?

3065
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:10,860
And so that's why I was like the week
of the fight I was like in nervous cause

3066
01:11:10,861 --> 01:11:11,690
it was like,

3067
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:11,991
oh,

3068
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:14,770
we're gonna get there late and you know,

3069
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:15,360
it was going to be all,

3070
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:15,661
you know,

3071
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:17,160
things are starting to go wrong already.

3072
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:18,330
And then once we landed,

3073
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:19,470
I kind of like put,

3074
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:20,580
put the pieces together like,

3075
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:21,660
oh yeah,

3076
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:21,901
that's,

3077
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:23,580
that's why everything
happens for a reason.

3078
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,750
So do you,

3079
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,840
you always feel like you're kind of
tuned in to something that other people

3080
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:28,710
aren't tuned into?

3081
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:29,481
Um,

3082
01:11:29,481 --> 01:11:31,010
it depends on where I'm at in my life.

3083
01:11:31,011 --> 01:11:32,330
Like sometimes if I'm,

3084
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:33,650
if I'm living the right way,

3085
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:34,581
if I'm healthy,

3086
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:35,190
if I'm like,

3087
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:35,540
you know,

3088
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,500
in shape or if I'm,

3089
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:37,603
you know,

3090
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:38,421
spiritually,

3091
01:11:38,421 --> 01:11:38,721
right.

3092
01:11:38,721 --> 01:11:38,901
Yeah.

3093
01:11:38,901 --> 01:11:41,690
Like a troubled,

3094
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,580
like if I'm surrounding myself,

3095
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:46,640
if I'm making the wrong choices of
I'm surrounding myself around like,

3096
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:47,150
you know,

3097
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:48,050
just evil and stuff.

3098
01:11:48,051 --> 01:11:48,810
Like if I'm,

3099
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:49,643
uh,

3100
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,250
just like the wrong people,

3101
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,030
you're trouble,

3102
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,370
then I won't have like,

3103
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,053
confused.

3104
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:56,480
Yeah.

3105
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,200
Then it's hard to make
clear decisions or like,

3106
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:01,063
yeah.

3107
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,300
Or to have good intuition.

3108
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:03,223
Yeah.

3109
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:08,310
So if you're free of any regret
or remorse of your own actions,

3110
01:12:09,771 --> 01:12:11,180
you're more clearly,

3111
01:12:11,181 --> 01:12:13,070
you can discern what's going
on in your environment.

3112
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:13,591
Right.

3113
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:14,550
And that's why I say like

3114
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,180
very,

3115
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:15,601
very,

3116
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:16,860
very super observant.

3117
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:17,820
I mean just coming up with a,

3118
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,950
and it's almost like a,

3119
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:24,390
I would say just from the stories that
I've heard of the growing up in the past,

3120
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,320
um,

3121
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,153
uh,

3122
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,960
because of those experiences,

3123
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,270
she got a really like a really good,

3124
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:33,390
a really good at scoping out a room,

3125
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,051
you know what I mean?

3126
01:12:34,051 --> 01:12:35,460
Like really like nothing can,

3127
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:35,701
like,

3128
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:37,540
it's really hard to sneak up on rose.

3129
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,630
She sees you coming from two days ago.

3130
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:40,464
Like it's just,

3131
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:41,011
it's really,

3132
01:12:41,011 --> 01:12:41,191
it's,

3133
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:41,411
it's,

3134
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:42,244
it's uh,

3135
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,040
she's very observant.

3136
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:44,491
I said,

3137
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:46,650
let's say that and in a way because of,

3138
01:12:46,651 --> 01:12:48,090
because of growing up,

3139
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,050
it's,

3140
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:51,390
it's a skill that had to be developed.

3141
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:53,280
You snuck up on me once.

3142
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:54,120
I don't ever happen again.

3143
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,133
Right.

3144
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,091
As kids,

3145
01:12:56,091 --> 01:12:56,570
like,

3146
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:56,871
you know,

3147
01:12:56,871 --> 01:12:58,670
people that I used to
like hang out with on the,

3148
01:12:58,750 --> 01:12:59,000
uh,

3149
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,721
in my neighborhood,

3150
01:12:59,721 --> 01:13:01,100
we would help each other out.

3151
01:13:01,101 --> 01:13:02,630
Like we would teach each other like,

3152
01:13:02,631 --> 01:13:02,841
yeah,

3153
01:13:02,841 --> 01:13:05,690
I don't go down that place or don't
hang out over there because somebody got

3154
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:06,320
shot over there.

3155
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:06,890
Like,

3156
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:07,723
you know,

3157
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,500
like the same car,

3158
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:11,540
like circles around this
block too many times.

3159
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:12,260
Like go inside,

3160
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:12,750
you know,

3161
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,271
kind of thing.

3162
01:13:13,271 --> 01:13:14,104
Yeah.

3163
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:16,160
How hard is it to watch each other fight

3164
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,000
when he was fighting?

3165
01:13:19,001 --> 01:13:19,850
It was pretty hard for me.

3166
01:13:19,851 --> 01:13:22,940
But then when I was actually there when
he had a kickboxing fight and I was

3167
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:24,110
actually able to be in his corner,

3168
01:13:24,111 --> 01:13:25,190
I felt a lot better.

3169
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:25,791
But,

3170
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:25,970
uh,

3171
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:27,470
being away at home,

3172
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,000
that was difficult for me.

3173
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,320
And also because she knew
internally I wasn't ready.

3174
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:32,803
Yeah.

3175
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:33,501
Yeah.

3176
01:13:33,501 --> 01:13:33,681
Well,

3177
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:35,330
I guess that's not all the time,

3178
01:13:35,331 --> 01:13:35,840
but yeah,

3179
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,490
that's also the big part of it.

3180
01:13:37,491 --> 01:13:37,701
Like,

3181
01:13:37,701 --> 01:13:41,390
I could have been more ready
for the majority of the
fights that rose was around

3182
01:13:41,391 --> 01:13:43,940
for what was wrong with me.

3183
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,700
Yeah,

3184
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:44,970
no,

3185
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:47,030
I meant just fighting for
the wrong reasons and,

3186
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:47,420
uh,

3187
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,030
just not,

3188
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:50,000
not necessarily going about
it in the healthiest way.

3189
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:50,271
I mean,

3190
01:13:50,271 --> 01:13:51,980
I had a prescription pill problem.

3191
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,510
The whiskey was delicious.

3192
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:53,721
I mean,

3193
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:53,931
just,

3194
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:54,390
just living,

3195
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:55,191
living in the living,

3196
01:13:55,191 --> 01:13:55,611
not that,

3197
01:13:55,611 --> 01:13:58,190
not the healthiest life
and not the best life.

3198
01:13:58,191 --> 01:13:59,024
Like,

3199
01:13:59,120 --> 01:13:59,650
like I said,

3200
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:00,411
I was doing,

3201
01:14:00,411 --> 01:14:02,960
I was doing it for the wrong reasons.

3202
01:14:02,961 --> 01:14:04,670
Like there was a when and I met,

3203
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,360
I said,

3204
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,050
um,

3205
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:06,291
uh,

3206
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:07,010
you are,

3207
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:09,200
you are good enough to
be a world champion.

3208
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,230
You're good enough to be the best in
the world and this is something that you

3209
01:14:11,231 --> 01:14:11,831
really want to do.

3210
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:13,210
I'll make sure you never
have to have a job.

3211
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,073
All you have to do is train.

3212
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:15,640
If this is something that
you really want to do,

3213
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,370
I'll make sure you never have
to work a day in your life.

3214
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,290
All you have to do is train
and be a fighter and that's it.

3215
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,600
So as soon as that started,

3216
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,020
um,

3217
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,040
I kind of,

3218
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:29,350
I caught myself getting into fights
asking how much does this one pay?

3219
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,180
25 and 25 all right,

3220
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:31,391
cool.

3221
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:33,430
I can do some math on if I
went into just another loose.

3222
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:33,791
All right,

3223
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:33,941
cool.

3224
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:34,630
Just get into the fight.

3225
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:35,201
She lost.

3226
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:36,400
I don't give a fuck how much.

3227
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,151
Like I,

3228
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:42,151
I find myself getting a uncontrollably
getting into that scenario now.

3229
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:43,450
The kickbox and message she was at,

3230
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,310
I was ready for that.

3231
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:45,830
Like I actually was,

3232
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,870
was passed all that,

3233
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:51,760
a shitty decision making that I was
making a and and was actually prepped for

3234
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:52,240
that woman.

3235
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,210
But there were other times where
whether it be conscious or not,

3236
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:58,690
subconsciously there
was somewhere inside of,

3237
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,040
I would guess the mind where
we both knew that I wasn't,

3238
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:04,030
I hadn't done,

3239
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,100
I'm supposed to do 10
but no one's looking.

3240
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:08,200
So I only did eight and it just
didn't say anything you want.

3241
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:09,370
I mean like that type of thing.

3242
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:11,290
Do you have regret?

3243
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:12,743
No,

3244
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:13,880
no,

3245
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,070
no,

3246
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,200
no,

3247
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:14,470
no.

3248
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:15,230
Never.

3249
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:17,630
And the reason why is because if
I go back and change anything,

3250
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,890
I won't be sitting here
talking to you right now.

3251
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:21,830
You don't like every
decision that I've made,

3252
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:26,150
every life experience that I've had dad
passing away when I was a kid having to

3253
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:27,200
do all these different,

3254
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:30,440
like all of the decisions that I've made
and all of the trials and tribulations

3255
01:15:30,441 --> 01:15:34,220
that I've been through have been exactly
why I'm sitting here right now with the

3256
01:15:34,221 --> 01:15:36,710
beautiful woman right next to me who
happens to be a world champion talking to

3257
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:37,544
Joe Rogan.

3258
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:38,080
And,

3259
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:38,381
you know,

3260
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:40,300
I've learned a lot of
lessons from his mistakes,

3261
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:40,511
you know,

3262
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:40,780
like,

3263
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,613
or an his,

3264
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,910
his successes as well,

3265
01:15:42,911 --> 01:15:43,211
you know,

3266
01:15:43,211 --> 01:15:44,044
just watching him.

3267
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,250
Um,

3268
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:45,461
yeah,

3269
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:46,330
it goes through all that is,

3270
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:47,680
it's helped me a lot.

3271
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:48,430
Yeah.

3272
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:49,150
No regrets.

3273
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:52,600
It's almost like I've been able to
experiment with having a UFC career,

3274
01:15:52,601 --> 01:15:55,120
but not actually having to like do it,

3275
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:55,361
you know,

3276
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:58,780
like living vicariously through him
and then now I can know what I can do.

3277
01:15:58,790 --> 01:15:58,980
Dip.

3278
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,400
It's like doing it all over again.

3279
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,080
When did you decide to stop pat?

3280
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,560
I have still not,

3281
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:05,693
he's still not,

3282
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:06,091
no.

3283
01:16:06,091 --> 01:16:06,340
No,

3284
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,173
I'm not.

3285
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:08,550
I'm never going to,

3286
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:10,670
okay.

3287
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:11,650
This is this,

3288
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,680
this doesn't have to be a belief
that everybody believes in,

3289
01:16:13,681 --> 01:16:16,530
but I believe that if you're a fighter,

3290
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,360
you don't really retire.

3291
01:16:18,361 --> 01:16:21,300
You'd ever really retire until
people just stop giving you fights.

3292
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,190
I'm never going to want to stay.

3293
01:16:23,191 --> 01:16:23,451
I'm,

3294
01:16:23,451 --> 01:16:24,690
I'm always one to want to fight.

3295
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,230
Always.

3296
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:25,531
Always,

3297
01:16:25,531 --> 01:16:25,771
always.

3298
01:16:25,771 --> 01:16:26,604
The last time you fought,

3299
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,190
man,

3300
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:29,023
two years ago.

3301
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:30,280
Was it in glory?

3302
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,000
Yeah.

3303
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,220
Uh,

3304
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:31,401
no.

3305
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:32,234
This was like

3306
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,540
no legacy.

3307
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:36,640
I think it fuck Demori Demario
Dennis who was maybe my last fight,

3308
01:16:36,641 --> 01:16:38,250
the last kickboxing match I think,

3309
01:16:38,251 --> 01:16:39,084
um,

3310
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,980
I think that was it like two years ago.

3311
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:44,010
But like I still want to fight now.

3312
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,030
I have a,

3313
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,400
uh,

3314
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,030
have a,

3315
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,570
a lateral meniscus tear
that I would like to get.

3316
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:49,291
I need for this,

3317
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:49,501
for,

3318
01:16:49,501 --> 01:16:52,800
for just my own happiness and for roses
training camp I need to get done with

3319
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:56,910
like take care of that because that puts
a lot of hindrance on training after

3320
01:16:56,911 --> 01:16:57,810
all these years.

3321
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,550
As soon as the knee starts feeling weird,

3322
01:16:59,690 --> 01:16:59,840
oh,

3323
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,460
automatic lease.

3324
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,910
Just take it easy and just
don't fuck with it too much.

3325
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:07,020
But the tear that can be fixed with stem
cells or is it something that has to be

3326
01:17:07,021 --> 01:17:10,310
done with the a scope
I think needs a scope.

3327
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:15,350
We are just finding out about stem cells
is a question I was going to ask you.

3328
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,190
How do you feel about that?

3329
01:17:16,191 --> 01:17:16,371
Like,

3330
01:17:16,371 --> 01:17:16,970
uh,

3331
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:17,351
I would,

3332
01:17:17,351 --> 01:17:17,690
you know,

3333
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:20,030
and he did what you told me before,

3334
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:23,180
but I'm a big believer in it.

3335
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:23,580
Yeah,

3336
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,140
yeah,

3337
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:24,381
yeah.

3338
01:17:24,381 --> 01:17:26,540
I'm sure it does some
pretty miraculous shit.

3339
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,370
If you use it correctly
and you get a good doctor.

3340
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:28,970
Yeah.

3341
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:32,270
So I'm looking at for Dr.
Davidson from the UFC.

3342
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:32,570
Yes.

3343
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:32,810
Yeah.

3344
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:33,860
Talk to him about it.

3345
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,191
He's,

3346
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:34,341
well,

3347
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:35,170
he's who I talked to her,

3348
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:36,590
I called him kind of in a,

3349
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,041
we have 11 left.

3350
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:39,320
Were you 11 weeks off from the fight?

3351
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:44,360
[inaudible] I would like to call myself
one a roses main training partners and

3352
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:49,100
it would be cool if I can get this need
taken care of either this week or next

3353
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,070
week at the latest so I can have the
few weeks off of recovery and still have

3354
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:54,500
seven weeks left to attack every day.

3355
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:54,891
You know what I mean?

3356
01:17:54,891 --> 01:17:55,041
Like,

3357
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,750
like in order for us to do that.

3358
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:58,670
But do I want to fight again?

3359
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,120
Yeah,

3360
01:17:59,120 --> 01:17:59,461
absolutely.

3361
01:17:59,461 --> 01:18:00,170
I'm always gonna want to

3362
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,480
[inaudible] I got to
fight all over yesterday.

3363
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:02,363
Hell No.

3364
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,860
Hell no,

3365
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:04,720
no,

3366
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:04,980
no,

3367
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:05,160
no.

3368
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:05,521
Hell No.

3369
01:18:05,521 --> 01:18:08,190
But I will,

3370
01:18:08,191 --> 01:18:08,910
I fight again.

3371
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:09,743
No idea.

3372
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:10,321
Roses,

3373
01:18:10,321 --> 01:18:10,820
roses,

3374
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,390
the star of the show though,

3375
01:18:12,391 --> 01:18:12,781
you know,

3376
01:18:12,781 --> 01:18:13,081
like,

3377
01:18:13,081 --> 01:18:13,440
Nah,

3378
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,170
it has to be like the right thing,

3379
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:16,621
you know,

3380
01:18:16,621 --> 01:18:17,720
like it has to be,

3381
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:18,871
everything has to me,

3382
01:18:18,871 --> 01:18:19,704
right?

3383
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,733
Oh,

3384
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:24,770
I think it was going to be like on a
Sunday at the county fair or sounds like

3385
01:18:24,771 --> 01:18:25,604
that.

3386
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:26,600
Pedro,

3387
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,320
his own man,

3388
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,510
he's a guy who's been around a long,

3389
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,410
a long time.

3390
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:32,810
He's been in some war a long time,

3391
01:18:32,811 --> 01:18:33,830
but I got off of that now.

3392
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:34,491
I said,

3393
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:34,851
no thank you,

3394
01:18:34,851 --> 01:18:35,900
but I'm still,

3395
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:40,790
I'm still getting the calls every once
in a while for not as much as you to say

3396
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:41,361
no thank you.

3397
01:18:41,361 --> 01:18:42,410
Because it was about offer.

3398
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:43,400
No,

3399
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:43,570
no,

3400
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:43,910
no,

3401
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:44,151
no,

3402
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:44,361
no,

3403
01:18:44,361 --> 01:18:44,600
no.

3404
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,433
Well,

3405
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:46,603
I don't know.

3406
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:48,411
Not,

3407
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:48,741
not,

3408
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:49,610
not good timing.

3409
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,550
And this is an MMA fighter
or a kickboxing fight,

3410
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:53,510
man.

3411
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:56,900
I think it was going to be a
kickboxing match with MMA gloves on,

3412
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,793
I think.

3413
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:58,700
I Dunno.

3414
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,710
But I also had another
fight with Eric Prindle.

3415
01:19:00,711 --> 01:19:01,910
Those supposed to be November 18th,

3416
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:05,660
that that was a kickboxing match
with the MMA gloves on I think.

3417
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:06,200
And um,

3418
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,760
that one got postponed,

3419
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:08,110
which,

3420
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,110
which was totally,

3421
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,280
completely great.

3422
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:13,010
Light rose is the shit.

3423
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:13,761
Yeah.

3424
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:15,170
I'm not getting,

3425
01:19:15,171 --> 01:19:16,430
I'm not getting in the way of that,

3426
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,110
like roses fucking rolling right now.

3427
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,130
I am calm.

3428
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:19,451
I,

3429
01:19:19,451 --> 01:19:20,060
I'm,

3430
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,160
I'm embracing the role of,

3431
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,750
of a coach and team leader now and not
being the athlete anymore and I get it.

3432
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,840
I know I'm 38 now.

3433
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,630
Whatever the fuck is going on with,

3434
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:33,231
with me,

3435
01:19:33,231 --> 01:19:34,610
which things are a lot better now.

3436
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:35,220
Uh,

3437
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:35,570
I'm,

3438
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,520
I'm healthy and everything's great,

3439
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:40,310
but rose is where it's at.

3440
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,690
Like that's where my attention,

3441
01:19:41,691 --> 01:19:43,280
my time and attention
has been since we met,

3442
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,473
since we met.

3443
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,920
And it's still going to be that way.

3444
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:46,730
Like roses,

3445
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:47,330
roses,

3446
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:48,410
I'm gonna I,

3447
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,940
I said when we met,

3448
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,440
I was gonna make it a point.

3449
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,333
You will be,

3450
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:52,660
you,

3451
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,830
you have what it takes to be the best,

3452
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,000
I'm going to make sure of it,

3453
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,960
you know,

3454
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,640
like that,

3455
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,780
that that's the role that I like,

3456
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:00,710
that's the role that I liked.

3457
01:20:00,711 --> 01:20:02,240
Now it's a lot more comfortable now.

3458
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,070
Oven baked pizza every fucking night.

3459
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:04,910
Like I love it.

3460
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:05,850
Like it's,

3461
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:10,020
it's more comfortable now for me to
do that now at the exact same time.

3462
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,420
It drives me crazy that I'm not fighting.

3463
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,660
You just got to have a,

3464
01:20:13,661 --> 01:20:14,491
a good purpose,

3465
01:20:14,491 --> 01:20:15,360
but how much you're doing,

3466
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:15,751
you know?

3467
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:16,920
It's just like the,

3468
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,660
the bottom line,

3469
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:18,931
you know,

3470
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:19,830
whatever you want to do,

3471
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:21,280
you can do anything that you want to do.

3472
01:20:21,281 --> 01:20:22,710
What was your reasoning?

3473
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:23,220
Right.

3474
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:23,760
And um,

3475
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,160
for me at this point
is to change the world.

3476
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:29,160
Like I know it's a little freshman
reasoning is to change the world.

3477
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:29,700
Yeah.

3478
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,210
Really?

3479
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:30,420
Yeah.

3480
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,160
How so?

3481
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:31,993
This is like my,

3482
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:34,680
this is the my best,

3483
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:35,340
uh,

3484
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,750
skill am I bet.

3485
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:39,480
Like the thing that I can
do the best and I think it,

3486
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:40,110
it,

3487
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:42,060
it reaches a lot of a big audience.

3488
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:42,630
Um,

3489
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,070
and I can get my message across.

3490
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:44,760
Yeah.

3491
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,810
And um,

3492
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:46,920
you know,

3493
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,280
like you were saying like it
just sat in a better example,

3494
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:51,391
trying to,

3495
01:20:51,391 --> 01:20:51,930
um,

3496
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,720
change the way people think or I leaches
offering a different perspective,

3497
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:54,910
you know,

3498
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:55,743
got to think like me,

3499
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:56,360
you know,

3500
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,060
um,

3501
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,340
is this is an active idea.

3502
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:00,241
It's in your head.

3503
01:21:00,241 --> 01:21:01,530
Like while you're training,

3504
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,030
while you're doing media,

3505
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,013
you thinking,

3506
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,820
I have a chance to change the world.

3507
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:06,601
I want to,

3508
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:07,290
um,

3509
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:12,270
build a urban farm in my community and
I want to make it available for like

3510
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:12,961
other people that,

3511
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:14,790
cause the way that I grew up.

3512
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:18,780
I wish there was like an urban farm where
I could learn how to grow my own food

3513
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:22,440
and I could get my own food that
was not from the grocery store,

3514
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:23,160
you know.

3515
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:23,993
Um,

3516
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,940
and so I want to provide
that for other people and,

3517
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:27,361
you know,

3518
01:21:27,361 --> 01:21:28,410
finds the best,

3519
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:29,790
the quickest way I can do that.

3520
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,660
And I think,

3521
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:31,350
you know,

3522
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:32,161
and there's other ways,

3523
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:32,480
you know,

3524
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,313
like,

3525
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:34,441
yeah,

3526
01:21:34,441 --> 01:21:35,310
for example,

3527
01:21:35,311 --> 01:21:36,144
um,

3528
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:39,390
I started getting into like some
crypto currencies and stuff and,

3529
01:21:39,391 --> 01:21:39,960
um,

3530
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,360
there's this thing called
Evergreen coin that's just like,

3531
01:21:42,361 --> 01:21:42,511
you know,

3532
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:43,300
one of the alt coins,

3533
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:43,790
whoever,

3534
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:44,161
I don't know,

3535
01:21:44,161 --> 01:21:44,341
it's,

3536
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:45,720
it's still a pretty small whatever,

3537
01:21:45,721 --> 01:21:46,400
but it's,

3538
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:46,710
it's a,

3539
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:49,950
so like it's a sustainable
cryptocurrency that,

3540
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,813
um,

3541
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:51,740
it doesn't,

3542
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,530
it doesn't use as much electricity
and it kind of goes into every kind of

3543
01:21:55,531 --> 01:21:57,060
philosophy that I agree upon.

3544
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:57,570
You know,

3545
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:58,290
it feels,

3546
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:00,120
it falls in line with my beliefs and it,

3547
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:00,840
um,

3548
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,480
there's just a lot of aspects
about it that I really like.

3549
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:05,820
And so that's something that like you get,

3550
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:06,703
um,

3551
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:07,710
you can,

3552
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,670
it's good for charities.

3553
01:22:08,671 --> 01:22:10,470
So like if you hold some evergreen coin,

3554
01:22:10,471 --> 01:22:11,460
like you can,

3555
01:22:11,461 --> 01:22:12,000
um,

3556
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,460
get some stock in it from,

3557
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:14,930
I mean,

3558
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,240
I sound kind of stupid trying
to recite all this information,

3559
01:22:18,241 --> 01:22:18,751
but yeah,

3560
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:19,530
like you just,

3561
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:23,790
you can generate money with it and then
you can donate it to charity and it

3562
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:24,624
works that way.

3563
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:25,620
Okay.

3564
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,650
So these are just a,

3565
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:31,290
a bunch of different things that you
would like to let people know about and

3566
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,550
help people understand.

3567
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:32,871
Yeah.

3568
01:22:32,871 --> 01:22:34,610
And I'm still formulating these ideas,

3569
01:22:34,611 --> 01:22:34,881
you know,

3570
01:22:34,881 --> 01:22:35,631
obviously like,

3571
01:22:35,631 --> 01:22:36,261
cause I mean,

3572
01:22:36,261 --> 01:22:38,060
fighting takes up all your time,

3573
01:22:38,061 --> 01:22:38,331
you know,

3574
01:22:38,331 --> 01:22:41,210
but I like to think about these
things and I think it just,

3575
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:41,661
you know,

3576
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:42,241
over time it,

3577
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:43,730
it's just kind of like
kind of fall into place,

3578
01:22:43,731 --> 01:22:43,941
you know,

3579
01:22:43,941 --> 01:22:45,140
just doing things like,

3580
01:22:45,141 --> 01:22:45,770
you know,

3581
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:50,030
the Indonesia earthship trip and like
just doing different stuff that I can,

3582
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:50,864
um,

3583
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:52,370
build skills for later.

3584
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,370
And you're going to do more of
this on your Youtube Channel?

3585
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,151
Yeah,

3586
01:22:55,151 --> 01:22:55,601
I'm trying to,

3587
01:22:55,601 --> 01:22:56,081
I'm trying to,

3588
01:22:56,081 --> 01:22:56,914
um,

3589
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,800
I've been trying to now as a chapter,

3590
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,090
it seems like a great idea.

3591
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:01,500
Yeah.

3592
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,050
Yeah.

3593
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,920
I've been trying to put
together the next episode.

3594
01:23:03,921 --> 01:23:05,020
I have a whole bunch of footage.

3595
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:05,800
Um,

3596
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,100
so

3597
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,520
like,

3598
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,353
sorry guys.

3599
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:09,390
It seems like something
I want to get involved,

3600
01:23:09,391 --> 01:23:11,790
like some sort of a production
company or something.

3601
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:12,001
I mean,

3602
01:23:12,001 --> 01:23:13,410
it seems like a no brainer to me.

3603
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:13,681
Yeah.

3604
01:23:13,681 --> 01:23:14,461
I've got a camera guy,

3605
01:23:14,461 --> 01:23:14,860
Austin,

3606
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:15,120
Eric,

3607
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:15,571
and who,

3608
01:23:15,571 --> 01:23:15,871
you know,

3609
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:17,220
he does a great job and um,

3610
01:23:17,221 --> 01:23:18,054
it's just been,

3611
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,680
it's just been kind of a roller coaster,

3612
01:23:19,681 --> 01:23:19,861
you know,

3613
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:21,030
all this traveling or just,

3614
01:23:21,031 --> 01:23:21,271
you know,

3615
01:23:21,271 --> 01:23:23,460
trying to get things together
and get my shit together.

3616
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,950
Will we also have to shut it down and
put it on pause after the Michelle fight?

3617
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:27,540
Yeah.

3618
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,530
After Michelle Waterson
fight however long ago,

3619
01:23:29,531 --> 01:23:29,951
that was,

3620
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:31,060
as soon as that was over with,

3621
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:32,490
we knew Yolanda was next and we,

3622
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,260
everything stopped.

3623
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:38,260
Social media kind just got off of like
that for a little while and not off of it

3624
01:23:38,871 --> 01:23:39,471
completely,

3625
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:43,640
but just trying to like minimize
it and because I knew that well,

3626
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:44,690
um,

3627
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:45,500
I think it,

3628
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,333
you know,

3629
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:46,970
I dunno,

3630
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:47,191
it's,

3631
01:23:47,191 --> 01:23:47,491
it's,

3632
01:23:47,491 --> 01:23:48,170
it's the,

3633
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:49,610
the most addictive drug,

3634
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:50,031
you know,

3635
01:23:50,031 --> 01:23:54,110
like just being on your phone and you
just fill your head up with just like a

3636
01:23:54,111 --> 01:23:58,700
whole bunch of information that like when
you're focused on just this one person

3637
01:23:58,701 --> 01:23:59,980
and like to defeat this person,

3638
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:00,801
this one mission,

3639
01:24:00,801 --> 01:24:01,820
it's hard to,

3640
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:02,570
you know,

3641
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:05,320
like you only have so much room in
your head for that kind of stuff.

3642
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:08,340
And also because we knew you ana was
checking her Instagram every day.

3643
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:08,830
Yeah,

3644
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:09,663
it was driver does,

3645
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,790
it would drive her crazy to not
post anything or be seen anywhere.

3646
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:13,540
Like,

3647
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:13,870
um,

3648
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:14,111
it's,

3649
01:24:14,111 --> 01:24:14,470
it's,

3650
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:15,330
it's uh,

3651
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:16,880
she even said in the interview,

3652
01:24:16,881 --> 01:24:17,181
she's like,

3653
01:24:17,181 --> 01:24:19,310
she don't want to do social
media and stuff is like,

3654
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:20,330
like,

3655
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:21,800
I mean like why does it bother you?

3656
01:24:21,801 --> 01:24:22,900
Like understand like

3657
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,680
she couldn't see you,

3658
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,320
she had no idea what you looked like.

3659
01:24:26,321 --> 01:24:27,570
She does training.

3660
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:29,710
She did send doing any of that offense.

3661
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:30,581
It probably,

3662
01:24:30,581 --> 01:24:31,610
she had paper view points.

3663
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,360
Yeah.

3664
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,460
So she had a,

3665
01:24:33,461 --> 01:24:35,080
she had a great reasoning to do it,

3666
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:37,850
but part of the strategy going
into this fight was to go see you,

3667
01:24:37,851 --> 01:24:38,650
Ana.

3668
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:38,981
That was,

3669
01:24:38,981 --> 01:24:40,060
that was a big,

3670
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,410
that was a factor.

3671
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:45,130
That was a big part of this
game plan was to ghost had,

3672
01:24:45,131 --> 01:24:46,360
no matter what she says,

3673
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:47,950
no matter what she does,

3674
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:49,900
and we knew that it was
going to come and level.

3675
01:24:49,901 --> 01:24:50,830
She's going to say this,

3676
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:52,270
then she's going to say this,

3677
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,830
then she's going to save this.

3678
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:55,420
Then she's going to talk about your dog.

3679
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:56,291
Like it's just gonna.

3680
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,940
It's gonna get bigger
and bigger and bigger.

3681
01:24:57,941 --> 01:24:58,840
And she might even,

3682
01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:00,820
we even knew she was going to touch you.

3683
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:01,900
She's gonna push you.

3684
01:25:01,901 --> 01:25:03,760
She's going to touch you when she does.

3685
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:04,870
Don't move,

3686
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,600
don't react given nothing.

3687
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:07,540
Give her nothing.

3688
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:08,710
And it worked.

3689
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:09,700
Now she knows though,

3690
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,493
the g

3691
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:16,230
and I'm going to be starting phase.

3692
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:16,720
I mean,

3693
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,590
she's the big mega,

3694
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:18,510
don't believe in,

3695
01:25:18,511 --> 01:25:18,811
you know,

3696
01:25:18,811 --> 01:25:19,290
like,

3697
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:19,790
I mean,

3698
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:19,970
go.

3699
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:21,380
Don't put a hex on her.

3700
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:22,881
She's gonna,

3701
01:25:22,881 --> 01:25:23,301
she's gonna.

3702
01:25:23,301 --> 01:25:24,830
She's coming mega bogies coming,

3703
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:25,933
she's going to be,

3704
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,630
I love it.

3705
01:25:27,631 --> 01:25:27,901
You know,

3706
01:25:27,901 --> 01:25:28,321
I don't,

3707
01:25:28,321 --> 01:25:29,490
I don't hate on her for doing it.

3708
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:30,011
She's doing,

3709
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:30,271
you know,

3710
01:25:30,271 --> 01:25:30,910
it's just,

3711
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,250
it's kind of like silly,

3712
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:32,521
you know,

3713
01:25:32,521 --> 01:25:32,881
to me.

3714
01:25:32,881 --> 01:25:33,940
But um,

3715
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:35,941
but it was great,

3716
01:25:35,941 --> 01:25:36,211
you know,

3717
01:25:36,211 --> 01:25:37,640
like without right.

3718
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:41,220
Without her and without my
contrast and personality,

3719
01:25:41,221 --> 01:25:44,100
that fight wouldn't have been
nearly as exciting as it was,

3720
01:25:44,101 --> 01:25:44,401
you know?

3721
01:25:44,401 --> 01:25:45,240
So like we need,

3722
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:48,660
I need her and that's why I think I like
to get people to understand like other

3723
01:25:48,661 --> 01:25:49,051
fighters,

3724
01:25:49,051 --> 01:25:52,260
like you need your opponent just as much
as you need your training partners and

3725
01:25:52,261 --> 01:25:53,850
your teammates and your coaches,

3726
01:25:53,851 --> 01:25:54,121
you know,

3727
01:25:54,121 --> 01:25:56,670
like is your dancing
partner like it's a show,

3728
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,190
you know,

3729
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,023
and it's awesome,

3730
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,040
but it's real to,

3731
01:25:59,041 --> 01:25:59,700
you know?

3732
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,180
Yeah.

3733
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,290
It's also what gets you up.

3734
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:01,900
Yeah.

3735
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:02,760
Gets you fired up.

3736
01:26:02,761 --> 01:26:05,330
I the to fight a woman
that's that dangerous.

3737
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:06,283
Yeah.

3738
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,630
Yeah.

3739
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,463
I don't know.

3740
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:09,431
Yo,

3741
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:09,641
Yo.

3742
01:26:09,641 --> 01:26:10,211
Hey Yo.

3743
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:12,310
So she told rose some crazy like,

3744
01:26:12,311 --> 01:26:12,521
okay,

3745
01:26:12,521 --> 01:26:14,140
so I'm all week shit was going on.

3746
01:26:14,141 --> 01:26:15,250
We missed the car accident,

3747
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:16,110
we missed the ant.

3748
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:18,040
Like the Antifa thing
happened right in front of us.

3749
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:18,521
Uh,

3750
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:21,580
we got down to the locker room and they
gave rose the wrong gloves and didn't

3751
01:26:21,581 --> 01:26:23,680
want to give her the right gloves
like Dave or the wrong gloves.

3752
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:24,760
What do you mean by the wrong gloves?

3753
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,130
Uh,

3754
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:28,460
I need like a bantamweight
sides glove and it gave me a,

3755
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,910
they gave a straw way going
somewhere specifically before hand.

3756
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:32,590
Yeah.

3757
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:33,423
Yeah.

3758
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:34,361
She got broken fingers.

3759
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:35,194
This was going on.

3760
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,610
I knew that these are piano playing hands.

3761
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:38,503
Yeah.

3762
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:40,950
We've got to the arena late.

3763
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:45,420
Like usually you get to the
arena and you have three hours.

3764
01:26:45,421 --> 01:26:45,590
Right.

3765
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:46,680
But you were just going to say something.

3766
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:47,670
You stopped yourself.

3767
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:48,300
You said she was,

3768
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,770
she said something to rose.

3769
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:50,540
Yeah.

3770
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:50,661
Yeah.

3771
01:26:50,661 --> 01:26:51,270
So I would get to like,

3772
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:51,600
we got,

3773
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:51,930
we got,

3774
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:52,800
we got to the regional late.

3775
01:26:52,801 --> 01:26:53,670
They gave him the wrong gloves,

3776
01:26:53,671 --> 01:26:56,050
they played the wrong walkout music like,

3777
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:56,910
and walk out music.

3778
01:26:57,190 --> 01:26:57,941
I have no idea.

3779
01:26:57,941 --> 01:26:58,900
It was something terrible.

3780
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,700
I was so mad.

3781
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:02,330
Who is mostly come out too?

3782
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:03,221
Well,

3783
01:27:03,221 --> 01:27:04,001
so originally,

3784
01:27:04,001 --> 01:27:04,461
what was it?

3785
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:05,294
It was we freedom.

3786
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:09,010
I switched it to that all week long.

3787
01:27:09,011 --> 01:27:09,820
I was like,

3788
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:11,110
cause I want to something uplifting,

3789
01:27:11,111 --> 01:27:11,771
something happy,

3790
01:27:11,771 --> 01:27:12,071
you know,

3791
01:27:12,071 --> 01:27:15,130
and and I was something that we've been
jamming out to for like a few weeks or

3792
01:27:15,131 --> 01:27:15,730
whatever.

3793
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,563
And um,

3794
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:17,890
the whole week I would
tell him how I'm like,

3795
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,600
I can't wait until late
playing my walkout song.

3796
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,890
It's just all I care about.

3797
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:23,100
They fostered that song.

3798
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:26,923
So

3799
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,770
he actually came out to do you know,

3800
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,840
I have no use like some oasis.

3801
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,390
I don't know.

3802
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:38,470
It was like someone make a decision
or did they fuck up till now?

3803
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,040
I try it.

3804
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,130
I think somebody told me
that there was a mistake.

3805
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:43,293
I'm sorry,

3806
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,160
Dickhead who loves oasis so
you don't miss the old year.

3807
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,030
What I want to hear man,

3808
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:50,320
I mean it's just such a contrast thing,

3809
01:27:50,321 --> 01:27:52,330
like style and be like,

3810
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:52,630
ah,

3811
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:54,490
I didn't even know how
you can make that mistake.

3812
01:27:54,491 --> 01:27:55,520
Like oh whatever.

3813
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,383
Be the best part,

3814
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:58,360
the best part of the week.

3815
01:27:58,361 --> 01:28:00,080
Because by the time that
happened it was like,

3816
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:00,330
ah,

3817
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:01,163
fuck it.

3818
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:02,390
Fucking everything,

3819
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:02,571
man.

3820
01:28:02,571 --> 01:28:03,291
It's fucking man.

3821
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:04,124
It's crazy.

3822
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:07,330
What will you going to say
that she said you want to,

3823
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:12,470
you don't want to be for the fight came
like they you do on the EU side of drug

3824
01:28:12,471 --> 01:28:13,250
testing,

3825
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:13,760
uh,

3826
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:18,680
roses walking back through the hallway
with her official as she crossed paths

3827
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:21,080
with Ilana and all by herself.

3828
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,580
And you want to go ahead?

3829
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:23,161
Oh yeah.

3830
01:28:23,161 --> 01:28:25,560
She like in a different tone of voice too,

3831
01:28:25,561 --> 01:28:26,640
like the weirdness,

3832
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:28,560
like she didn't seem
like herself for a sec.

3833
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:28,831
I mean,

3834
01:28:28,831 --> 01:28:31,500
I'm sure it is getting in fight mode or
whatever and it's just like breaking in

3835
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:32,670
her gloves and you see like,

3836
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:33,840
and that gave her like the US up,

3837
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:34,620
you know?

3838
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,210
And she gave me the what's
up and then she was like,

3839
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:37,800
I'm just like,

3840
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:39,300
I think she asked me something like,

3841
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:40,620
cause you buy the ticket.

3842
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:41,610
All right.

3843
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:42,443
I was like,

3844
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,320
she's like,

3845
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,180
do you believe him or
do you believe in them?

3846
01:28:45,181 --> 01:28:45,970
Or something like that.

3847
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:46,751
Do you believe him?

3848
01:28:46,751 --> 01:28:47,740
Did you buy the ticket?

3849
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:48,280
Yeah.

3850
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,600
And then she walked off

3851
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:51,570
and didn't say no and I was just like,

3852
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:52,753
uh,

3853
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:53,873
it was like,

3854
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:55,173
wow.

3855
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:55,921
Did you buy the test?

3856
01:28:55,921 --> 01:28:57,480
She's Kaiser Sosa.

3857
01:28:59,140 --> 01:28:59,621
Yes.

3858
01:28:59,621 --> 01:29:01,300
His Dad to do that like all week long way.

3859
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:02,163
Even in the

3860
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:02,970
no way in,

3861
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:03,420
you know,

3862
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,490
after the way ins this of
like all kinds of stuff.

3863
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:09,840
I'm fucking shit right back to the
locker room now we're ready all week.

3864
01:29:09,841 --> 01:29:11,070
We've been deflecting shit.

3865
01:29:11,071 --> 01:29:12,500
We've been deflecting shit now roses,

3866
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:13,870
a very emotional person template.

3867
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:14,630
Like she's,

3868
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:15,600
we got to keep rolling.

3869
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:18,240
Keep rolling straight cause she comes
in with the wrong look on her face.

3870
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,633
Something's wrong.

3871
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:22,160
She goes off and does the
drug testing comes back.

3872
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,740
And when she sat down she
sits down and he says,

3873
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,293
we have to,

3874
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:28,730
we have to have a meeting now that's cold.

3875
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:29,810
We have to have a meeting.

3876
01:29:29,811 --> 01:29:30,351
Is Code for,

3877
01:29:30,351 --> 01:29:31,041
shut it down.

3878
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:32,060
Everybody get the fuck out.

3879
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:33,320
We were bouncing.

3880
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,110
We have to have a meeting is like kind
of another way of saying start the

3881
01:29:36,111 --> 01:29:36,530
countdown.

3882
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:37,363
We're leaving.

3883
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,300
We have to have a meeting.

3884
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:39,321
And when she said that,

3885
01:29:39,321 --> 01:29:40,120
the way she said it,

3886
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,210
I mean everything came over me like,

3887
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:41,931
oh fuck.

3888
01:29:41,931 --> 01:29:43,100
Well what happened?

3889
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,331
And then when she said,

3890
01:29:44,331 --> 01:29:45,830
would you wanna sit in the back?

3891
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,731
What do you want to told her?

3892
01:29:46,731 --> 01:29:47,420
Do you believe him?

3893
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,760
Did you buy the ticket and then left

3894
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,390
without any explanation?

3895
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:52,110
Yo,

3896
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:52,760
when wrote,

3897
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:53,880
when Rose said that to me,

3898
01:29:53,881 --> 01:29:56,520
my fucking head exploded it and
the only thing I could say was,

3899
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:57,503
ah,

3900
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:57,931
shit,

3901
01:29:57,931 --> 01:30:00,150
I don't want to have to fucking
think about this all night.

3902
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:04,343
Oh

3903
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,593
Man.

3904
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:15,470
You know she's been notable time world
champion and she just knows how to fuck

3905
01:30:17,551 --> 01:30:18,384
with people,

3906
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:18,810
Bro.

3907
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:20,070
We deflected everything.

3908
01:30:20,071 --> 01:30:23,970
We deflected the knuckles in the mouth
in the crazy shit that she was saying,

3909
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:25,020
ticket everything.

3910
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:27,850
And if she came and said that
when we got back to Louisiana,

3911
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:28,703
just five minutes

3912
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,600
delayed or,

3913
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,433
or

3914
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:36,903
for,

3915
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:39,060
for a good three,

3916
01:30:39,061 --> 01:30:41,730
four minutes for three or four minutes,

3917
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:42,751
Trevor,

3918
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:45,270
Tony Rose and I all sat
in the locker room just

3919
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:47,870
because,

3920
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:48,600
because,

3921
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,190
because that was the little,

3922
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:53,930
that was the little thing that could
have fucked everything up because I know.

3923
01:30:54,530 --> 01:30:55,460
What does that mean?

3924
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:57,410
What does that mean?

3925
01:30:57,411 --> 01:30:58,244
Did you buy the two?

3926
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:59,100
Cause they're email,

3927
01:30:59,100 --> 01:30:59,511
she says,

3928
01:30:59,511 --> 01:31:00,320
do you believe him?

3929
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,760
But you had to know it was horse shit.

3930
01:31:01,761 --> 01:31:02,060
Right?

3931
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:03,360
You had to know what she was doing.

3932
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:10,370
Like if you ran into someone at the
fucking seven 11 and they said something

3933
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:12,020
like that's crazy asshole.

3934
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:13,700
It'd be out of your head in a minute.

3935
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:17,040
But she said it with a calm
voice and then just walked off.

3936
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,613
No accent,

3937
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:22,430
no accent.

3938
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:25,790
Just said it just said it real common
like to the point where there's,

3939
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:27,440
there's even a chance

3940
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,690
and I think this one there's
even a chance that you want it.

3941
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,250
No recollection of nowhere.

3942
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:34,313
Maybe she,

3943
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,191
I don't know man.

3944
01:31:35,191 --> 01:31:37,710
I was just like red
roses be spooky sometimes

3945
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:42,070
like so there's a chance that like just
with the way the whole week when that

3946
01:31:42,071 --> 01:31:46,480
maybe that was let's say God or a
higher being or something like that.

3947
01:31:46,481 --> 01:31:48,040
Maybe that was the last test.

3948
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,570
Do you fucking believe him?

3949
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:54,850
Did you buy the ticket and then just
walked off was that was a test of whether

3950
01:31:54,851 --> 01:31:55,684
or not

3951
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,490
we're going to get all the way down to
right here and you're going to be fucked

3952
01:31:58,491 --> 01:31:58,810
in the head.

3953
01:31:58,810 --> 01:31:59,840
Now knew by the way,

3954
01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:04,690
this is after the facts re
re mastering the system.

3955
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,531
By the way,

3956
01:32:05,531 --> 01:32:06,580
like in a moment,

3957
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:07,750
something inside of me.

3958
01:32:07,751 --> 01:32:08,081
I was like,

3959
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:08,950
I don't know what she's talking about,

3960
01:32:08,951 --> 01:32:11,000
but just gave her the thumbs up like yeah,

3961
01:32:11,001 --> 01:32:11,381
I'm a fuck.

3962
01:32:11,381 --> 01:32:12,214
I believe in him.

3963
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:15,010
Like I don't know what
you're talking about.

3964
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:15,870
Yeah.

3965
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:23,900
Yeah.

3966
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:24,490
Hey Yo man,

3967
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:27,850
we didn't know we were in the locker
room and really rose had to get up to go

3968
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:31,180
and do something over there and when she
got over there I turned to Trevor and

3969
01:32:31,181 --> 01:32:31,660
Tony said,

3970
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:32,081

3971
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:32,620

It's so crazy.

3975
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,360
That one little silly thing.

3976
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:37,530
Yeah.

3977
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:39,100
She's just trying to fuck with your head.

3978
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:39,190
Right.

3979
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:40,050
That actually works.

3980
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:41,590
Got Three minutes.

It's just like a little mind fuck yes.

3983
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:48,000

Yeah,

3989
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:54,363

3990
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:55,230
Yeah.

3991
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:55,390
Hey,

3993
01:32:56,741 --> 01:32:57,491
I said they start thing.

3994
01:32:57,491 --> 01:32:57,701
I was like,

3995
01:32:57,701 --> 01:33:00,520
what did I do now do
you think at all about,

3996
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:02,350
you don't think at all about
doing that back to her.

3997
01:33:02,351 --> 01:33:04,630
I mean you just fucked
her up in the first round.

3998
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,140
So what do you say that I did it like
I did fuck her up and I had though,

3999
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:12,430
you definitely did you fuck me up
and I was about to interview you.

4000
01:33:12,431 --> 01:33:12,740
I'm like,

4001
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:14,830
she got this thousand
yard stare and she's,

4002
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:15,671
and I was like,

4003
01:33:15,671 --> 01:33:16,480
what were you saying?

4004
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:16,751
And you're like,

4005
01:33:16,751 --> 01:33:17,770
I was saying the Lord's prayer.

4006
01:33:17,771 --> 01:33:18,130
I was like,

4007
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:19,420
oh Jesus Christ.

4008
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:22,030
Right there was like
the devil and a priest.

4009
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:22,571
I was like,

4010
01:33:22,571 --> 01:33:23,420
the two of you together.

4011
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:24,263
It was like,

4012
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:27,450
and she was like saying
she was the Boogie,

4013
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:31,710
it was one of my favorite
stare downs and the buildup,

4014
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:35,190
the way you handled it was
very interesting because
most people handled it.

4015
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:36,580
They'd get in her face too.

4016
01:33:36,581 --> 01:33:37,480
Fuck you bitch.

4017
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:40,840
Claudia and her would get together.

4018
01:33:40,841 --> 01:33:43,130
And I think that emotional,

4019
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,470
like the conflict and all the,

4020
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,680
the extra energy that's involved in that,

4021
01:33:47,681 --> 01:33:47,971
like he,

4022
01:33:47,971 --> 01:33:49,240
it fucks with people's heads.

4023
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:49,710
Right,

4024
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:49,840
right.

4025
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:50,770
And that's what she's looking for.

4026
01:33:50,771 --> 01:33:52,330
I think I over you on his career.

4027
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:55,870
She came in as a silent killer
who's destroying everybody
and then she found out

4028
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:57,130
that if I start talking shit to someone,

4029
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,320
they get fucked in the head
before the fight even happens.

4030
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:00,830
And then it worked and
worked and it worked.

4031
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,900
So he got to the point where she's that,

4032
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,090
that,

4033
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:05,170
that almost,

4034
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:06,461
that,

4035
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:06,790
that,

4036
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:11,330
that one weapon right there almost
replaced some of the ferociousness in,

4037
01:34:11,331 --> 01:34:11,551
in,

4038
01:34:11,551 --> 01:34:12,520
in her fighting maybe.

4039
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:12,820
Yeah.

4040
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:13,540
Like,

4041
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:14,650
like knowing that end,

4042
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:18,730
that why is also why the game plan was,

4043
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,670
was to go see Awana no
matter what happens.

4044
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:23,950
Like we know that she needs a reaction.

4045
01:34:23,951 --> 01:34:25,030
She's looking for something,

4046
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:25,811
no pictures,

4047
01:34:25,811 --> 01:34:26,321
no videos,

4048
01:34:26,321 --> 01:34:27,101
no social media,

4049
01:34:27,101 --> 01:34:27,671
no interviews,

4050
01:34:27,671 --> 01:34:28,241
no nothing.

4051
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:29,021
And when she says something,

4052
01:34:29,021 --> 01:34:29,854
don't even look at it.

4053
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,810
Just like she doesn't exist.

4054
01:34:31,811 --> 01:34:32,191
Just ghost.

4055
01:34:32,191 --> 01:34:33,850
It goes to the entire time.

4056
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,290
We know for a fact that even
before we were signed up to fight,

4057
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:39,133
she's thinking about me.

4058
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,110
You know,

4059
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:42,710
like she knew I was on
the radar of course.

4060
01:34:42,711 --> 01:34:43,500
A long time.

4061
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:43,850
Yeah,

4062
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:45,250
of course you have to be.

4063
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:45,700
Yeah.

4064
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:45,881
I mean,

4065
01:34:45,881 --> 01:34:49,270
there's a handful of contenders in the
strawweight division and you are at the

4066
01:34:49,271 --> 01:34:51,610
top of the heap and especially
after you beat Michelle,

4067
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,240
right?

4068
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:52,750
Yeah,

4069
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:53,583
yeah,

4070
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,520
yeah.

4071
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:55,211
That's how we knew it.

4072
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:56,230
So no social media,

4073
01:34:56,231 --> 01:34:56,771
no nothing.

4074
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:57,140
We just,

4075
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:57,500
we just don't,

4076
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:57,680
no,

4077
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,070
it was just

4078
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:58,701
feels better,

4079
01:34:58,701 --> 01:34:58,971
you know,

4080
01:34:58,971 --> 01:35:00,530
like not having to do all that,

4081
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,220
you know,

4082
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:02,053
but I mean

4083
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,440
on you to try to do that kind of shit.

4084
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:05,260
No,

4085
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:05,510
they,

4086
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,821
they,

4087
01:35:05,821 --> 01:35:06,210
they,

4088
01:35:06,210 --> 01:35:06,511
they,

4089
01:35:06,511 --> 01:35:07,321
they did,

4090
01:35:07,321 --> 01:35:08,400
but we sold,

4091
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:12,330
honestly said not this time
that they just understood.

4092
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:13,380
Yeah.

4093
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:14,520
We've very honestly said,

4094
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:15,450
no,

4095
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,283
that's not me.

4096
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:17,420
That's not going to work out for us.

4097
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:17,911
We need to,

4098
01:35:17,911 --> 01:35:21,300
we need to prepare for this fight
and we need to be all the way ready.

4099
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:24,390
Now there's of course there's some
interviews that need to be done,

4100
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,860
but the other,

4101
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:27,060
like the other little things,

4102
01:35:27,061 --> 01:35:28,320
like how come you not posting about them?

4103
01:35:28,321 --> 01:35:28,450
I mean,

4104
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:29,450
not re tweeting this picture,

4105
01:35:29,451 --> 01:35:29,820
it's like,

4106
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:30,290
nope,

4107
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:30,400
not,

4108
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:30,581
no.

4109
01:35:30,581 --> 01:35:33,660
It'd be hilarious if you did a bunch
of shit that had nothing to do with the

4110
01:35:33,661 --> 01:35:34,080
fight.

4111
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:34,771
Like almost like,

4112
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:35,011
you know,

4113
01:35:35,011 --> 01:35:35,844
even fighting,

4114
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:36,883
right.

4115
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:38,540
It's found a cool Indian restaurant.

4116
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:40,723
I know.

4117
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:41,810
Seriously.

4118
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,291
Oh,

4119
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:43,130
I love this movie.

4120
01:35:43,131 --> 01:35:43,970
It's Hilarious,

4121
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:46,443
right?

4122
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,870
No pad hitting,

4123
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:51,250
no shit talk and the
motivational speeches,

4124
01:35:51,251 --> 01:35:51,530
I mean,

4125
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:52,580
because really like,

4126
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:56,480
I think you should like show other
sides of you other than just like,

4127
01:35:56,481 --> 01:35:59,000
I think I get kind of just bored,

4128
01:35:59,001 --> 01:36:01,700
just posting and other group
picture and other like,

4129
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:01,941
oh,

4130
01:36:01,941 --> 01:36:03,440
this is what I'm eating today.

4131
01:36:03,441 --> 01:36:04,111
Or you know,

4132
01:36:04,111 --> 01:36:04,431
like here,

4133
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:06,110
this is my workout today.

4134
01:36:06,111 --> 01:36:06,740
I don't know.

4135
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:09,770
I mean some of the word goals
is definitely to be watched.

4136
01:36:09,771 --> 01:36:11,210
Like we got some cool footage,

4137
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:11,830
uh,

4138
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:12,460
hiding away.

4139
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:13,293
But

4140
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:17,950
did you post that stuff after the fight
or do you think that any of the stuff

4141
01:36:17,951 --> 01:36:18,784
that you post,

4142
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,310
like on workout footage,

4143
01:36:21,311 --> 01:36:21,981
training footage,

4144
01:36:21,981 --> 01:36:23,590
especially like working on technique,

4145
01:36:23,591 --> 01:36:26,680
do you think that in any way
that helps people read you?

4146
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,870
I don't know cause it's totally different
standing across from me in the ring,

4147
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:30,441
you know what I mean?

4148
01:36:30,441 --> 01:36:31,540
Like I could train,

4149
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:32,750
I mean I trained with teacher's door is,

4150
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:32,991
you know,

4151
01:36:32,991 --> 01:36:33,570
like,

4152
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:34,550
and we fought each other.

4153
01:36:34,551 --> 01:36:35,930
We've lived in the same house together,

4154
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:37,130
like for multiple weeks.

4155
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:37,401
You know,

4156
01:36:37,401 --> 01:36:38,570
and I'll still fight her again.

4157
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,171
You know what I mean?

4158
01:36:39,171 --> 01:36:39,621
So it's like,

4159
01:36:39,621 --> 01:36:40,454
it's not,

4160
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:41,370
it's,

4161
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:42,140
you can't,

4162
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:43,430
I mean there's things you can pick up.

4163
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:43,671
Yeah.

4164
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:45,200
But I'm gonna change it up on you.

4165
01:36:45,201 --> 01:36:46,880
I always got another ace in my pocket,

4166
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:47,743
you know?

4167
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:48,913
Yeah.

4168
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:50,450
I like to,

4169
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:51,710
I don't,

4170
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:52,151
I don't know.

4171
01:36:52,151 --> 01:36:53,300
I keep everything to myself,

4172
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:53,651
you know,

4173
01:36:53,651 --> 01:36:54,390
like I said,

4174
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:55,011
you want to give,

4175
01:36:55,011 --> 01:36:55,380
you know,

4176
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:56,213
sure.

4177
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:56,790
Training.

4178
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:56,970
The,

4179
01:36:56,970 --> 01:36:57,211
the,

4180
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:57,430
the,

4181
01:36:57,430 --> 01:36:58,263
the challenge.

4182
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,970
So it's so,

4183
01:36:59,971 --> 01:37:00,540
uh,

4184
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,700
it's so barely different,

4185
01:37:02,701 --> 01:37:03,090
but,

4186
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:05,760
but it is still different how you
can train together all day and night.

4187
01:37:05,761 --> 01:37:07,170
But when the bell rings for a fight,

4188
01:37:07,171 --> 01:37:08,010
it's totally different.

4189
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:08,290
Yes.

4190
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:08,900
You ever hear,

4191
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:09,451
you ever hear,

4192
01:37:09,451 --> 01:37:09,660
uh,

4193
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:10,341
stories of clay,

4194
01:37:10,341 --> 01:37:12,720
Guido and the gym and
at practice he can't.

4195
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:13,440
They appear.

4196
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:13,681
We,

4197
01:37:13,681 --> 01:37:14,640
we've been hearing for years.

4198
01:37:14,641 --> 01:37:14,941
I played,

4199
01:37:14,941 --> 01:37:15,351
we had a good,

4200
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:17,580
it just gets thrown around
at the gym all day and night,

4201
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:19,140
but when he gets in the
rink and fight like a Mazda,

4202
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:20,540
like we've like,

4203
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:20,820
there are,

4204
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:21,420
they can,

4205
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,070
they can train together all day and night,

4206
01:37:23,071 --> 01:37:24,150
but when it comes five time,

4207
01:37:24,450 --> 01:37:24,871
it's just,

4208
01:37:24,871 --> 01:37:25,591
it's just different.

4209
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:25,850
Huh.

4210
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:28,250
Funny my ability that I'm
really good at what I do,

4211
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:28,611
you know?

4212
01:37:28,611 --> 01:37:29,360
And it's just,

4213
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,920
it makes it more fun to share
it with people and like,

4214
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,870
you know,

4215
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:34,670
but I want to give all my secrets away.

4216
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:36,283
You know,

4217
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:37,670
he had to keep making up new ones,

4218
01:37:37,671 --> 01:37:38,360
you know.

4219
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:38,980
Um,

4220
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:40,000
well listen rose,

4221
01:37:40,001 --> 01:37:42,220
I'm happier out there
cause you a lot of fun.

4222
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,600
I really enjoy calling your fights
and I really did enjoy that whole,

4223
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,650
the whole week,

4224
01:37:48,010 --> 01:37:50,730
all the press conferences and your,

4225
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:51,670
your behavior.

4226
01:37:51,671 --> 01:37:53,350
And I think to this day,

4227
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:54,161
like I said,

4228
01:37:54,161 --> 01:37:55,380
after your fight,

4229
01:37:55,381 --> 01:37:57,130
that post fight speech was my,

4230
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:58,560
one of my all time favorites.

4231
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:58,920
Yeah,

4232
01:37:58,920 --> 01:37:59,370
thank you.

4233
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:00,001
It was awesome.

4234
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:01,110
And it was very genuine,

4235
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:01,500
you know,

4236
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,480
and I think you guys have
an awesome relationship.

4237
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:04,171
It's very cool.

4238
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:07,710
It's very cool to see you guys and how
much he cares about you and the way you

4239
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:08,640
guys work together.

4240
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:08,820
It's,

4241
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:09,870
it's fucking awesome.

4242
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:10,690
Yeah.

4243
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:11,371
Hopefully we can,

4244
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:11,850
uh,

4245
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:13,410
maybe not make the on Lisa again,

4246
01:38:13,411 --> 01:38:14,340
but you know,

4247
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,240
making the,

4248
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,073
and called,

4249
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:18,150
we called Dana White
and told them after the,

4250
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,100
when they were asking for the next fight,

4251
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:21,420
they're trying to get
us out of the contract.

4252
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:22,980
We told him that she won the belt,

4253
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:24,090
so we were going to start a family.

4254
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:27,151
She wanted the belt.

4255
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,550
So we're going to start a family and now
he'd come back in a few years and then

4256
01:38:29,551 --> 01:38:30,990
did he say they didn't like that at all?

4257
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,830
It was like,

4258
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:32,101
Nah,

4259
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:32,281
man,

4260
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:33,114
just kit

4261
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,620
April 7th paper view.

4262
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:39,720
I'm going to be there and I can't wait.

4263
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:40,111
Thank you,

4264
01:38:40,111 --> 01:38:40,830
Pat Barry.

4265
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:41,663
Thank you rose.

4266
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:43,220
The rose.
