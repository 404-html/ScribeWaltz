happy to be here and my friends.

28
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,470
Thank you to whoever gave me this
this weekend at the icehouse.

29
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,010
Some dude gave me hunter s Thompson
is the rum diary a nice paper back.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,730
Just one of the things I
got it is shared drugs.

31
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,200
Psychedelics,

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,550
have you done your share yet?

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,120
No,

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,980
not yet as mushrooms.

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,000
I took a four hour
shower on mushrooms once.

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,223
Nice.

37
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,290
And then I was hiking in big whiskey
mountain on mushrooms with my buddy.

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,060
We decided to take a back route,

39
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:27,661
which you never do.

40
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:28,860
I was climbing up a landslide.

41
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:29,371
That's smart.

42
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:29,831
And I was like,

43
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:30,181
to my buddy,

44
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:30,331
I go,

45
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:31,040
dude.

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,261
He goes,

47
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:31,381
what?

48
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:31,680
I go,

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,850
you got to move with the mountain.

50
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,170
You're not moving with the mountain.

51
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,350
He's like,

52
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,731
okay,

53
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:36,600
he's a real mountain mine.

54
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,321
So he's climbing.

55
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:37,501
I go,

56
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,580
still not more in the mountain.

57
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,443
Okay,

58
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,650
I'm gonna stay here and talk to this rock.

59
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,500
And I had to have a conversation with
the Rock and then as he tells it,

60
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,820
we're on top of whisky mountain,

61
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,410
which is a very big mountain.

62
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,070
Okay.

63
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,050
Luckily it was in the summer as well.

64
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,450
I was with,

65
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,470
I was dating Patrick back in the day
and they were waiting downstairs and he

66
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:56,550
turns back around and I'm
not wearing any clothes.

67
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,533
And I mean,

68
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,373
no clue.

69
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,280
And I'm,

70
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,470
I'm top of a mountain that you,

71
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,510
that takes a really long time
to climb up and I'm naked.

72
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,730
What'd you do with the clothes?

73
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,950
Oh,

74
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,910
we never found my clothes.

75
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:06,840
No,

76
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,460
but I did stop and eat
a lot of blueberries

77
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,300
and by the time we also took a shit,

78
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:12,780
um,

79
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,411
squatting.

80
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:15,210
And then as I was doing that naked,

81
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,950
my buddy moved some branches pretending
it was a bear jumped up and started to

82
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,970
run and uh,

83
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,110
that caused a problem.

84
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,230
And then I came back down the mountain,

85
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,100
all scratched up,

86
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:29,090
no clothes and I can't
stop and eat blueberries.

87
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,750
My buddy who's got you
stop eating blueberries.

88
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:31,740
I had a blue mouth.

89
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,130
Uh,

90
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,551
Shit.

91
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,384
You walked,

92
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,470
you walked barefoot.

93
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,520
That's right.

94
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,090
My phone.

95
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,810
I'll cut up.

96
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,250
My skills was going to take,

97
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:38,820
I don't know,

98
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,200
a day and a,

99
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,034
I literally,

100
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,640
literally,

101
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,460
literally probably four
hours or something,

102
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:46,980
like a five hours were up
at any point during the war.

103
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,031
When I finally got down,

104
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:50,170
I had a blue mouth from
eating blueberries and,

105
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,440
and I was all cut up and patty was like,

106
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,700
what you're doing?

107
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:53,970
I was like,

108
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,260
I need to did my ass in the lake.

109
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,270
I've shit ass cause I didn't have,

110
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,440
I couldn't walk wipe it.

111
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,411
So,

112
00:02:59,411 --> 00:02:59,910
um,

113
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,130
yeah,

114
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,671
one another.

115
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,690
One of my shit stories.

116
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:02,524
Thank you.

117
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,461
So,

118
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,061
so she was like,

119
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:04,271
wow,

120
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,081
that's attractive.

121
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,351
You're a,

122
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,100
you're my man.

123
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,110
Well I'll take the skinny guy with the
Blue Mountain has shit in his assets.

124
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,650
It was coming down off mushrooms.

125
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,220
So that was my experience
with [inaudible].

126
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,440
How much did you take?

127
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,000
Did I heat?

128
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,210
My buddy gave me just a handful,

129
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,180
handful,

130
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,800
it goes eat them.

131
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,633
I was like,

132
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,533
okay,

133
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,980
I want to have an experience.

134
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,740
You got to get them on an empty stomach.

135
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:27,160
I hadn't eaten.

136
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,491
Of course.

137
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,324
That's really good.

138
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,830
And we're climbing man.

139
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,320
And I just started literally
just hallucinating.

140
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,441
I,

141
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,030
you're better off that
you didn't eat anything.

142
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:34,890
If you had eaten something,

143
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,550
you'd probably throw it really bad.

144
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,900
I took a shower one time,

145
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,010
I wouldn't get out of the shower.

146
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,780
Patty was banging on
the door and I was like,

147
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,291
I'll be there.

148
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,640
I'm trying to figure something out.

149
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,540
And then,

150
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:43,900
nope.

151
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,800
It's hard to explain.

152
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:48,180
But I believe I kept seeing my profile
and the first thing I was like,

153
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:48,760
cause I kept saying,

154
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,301
Oh fuck,

155
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,530
I wish I was barrel chested.

156
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,510
I'm not barrel chest,

157
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,260
my grandfather's barrel chested.

158
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,900
I know I have a sunken chest.

159
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:56,734
This is horse shit.

160
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,271
I was like,

161
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,290
that's a terrible profile.

162
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,430
So then I resolved,

163
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,930
resolved while I was in the shower to
just spend the entire summer on a bench

164
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:05,231
press.

165
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,340
I was going to hire a coach,

166
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,180
just a bench,

167
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,680
which that never happened.

168
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,060
And then I came out of the shower and
then I had this experience of somebody

169
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:15,400
standing like watching me and judging me.

170
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,190
And I felt like it was the devil
telling me that I was a phony.

171
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:18,840
So I was like,

172
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:18,930
oh,

173
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,571
I'm a phony.

174
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,650
I'm a skinny phony.

175
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,790
Why you think it was the devil?

176
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,653
I don't fucking know.

177
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,111
I just felt,

178
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:25,620
I saw this just felt like
that's what it was like.

179
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,220
It was just the truth.

180
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:28,570
And so me and I was so raw.

181
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,540
I came out fucking God.

182
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,713
Maybe,

183
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:32,900
maybe.

184
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,500
Or was it just felt like the
devil because he didn't want to,

185
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,880
didn't want to admit the truth.

186
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,714
Exactly.

187
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,610
That's what the badge that is,

188
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,330
bro.

189
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,070
I can always tell the people,

190
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:42,760
you can just see,

191
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,830
it's so interesting to watch how people,

192
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,780
like I was thinking
about this the other day,

193
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,520
how people basically as adults,

194
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,800
like I would call it to adulthood and
what they call maturity is the slow

195
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,890
acceptance of what you will never be.

196
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,150
That's kind of what it is.

197
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,910
So what happens is you so much things,

198
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,290
you see little girls
dressed like princesses,

199
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:02,890
right?

200
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,240
And and that's their ideal.

201
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,260
They grow up with these ideas.

202
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,810
We still,

203
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,330
we stick these ideals and children.

204
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,450
Like you're going to marry a prince and
he's going to be pimped prince charming

205
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,610
and that shit gets whittled away.

206
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,550
You start settling for
simulation and simulation.

207
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,140
It basically your life becomes,

208
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:20,950
I'll take what I can get until finally
you're dating some guy with on his ears

209
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:21,910
and a pot belly.

210
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:23,380
Well at least he pays a fucking bills,

211
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,700
which is when I like to get them.

212
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:25,360
By the way,

213
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,160
I like to get them when they're
just going through a divorce,

214
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,080
had their heartbroken to 300 times.

215
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:29,621
They're 40.

216
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,970
They work out way too much.

217
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,090
That anger and frustration is combined
into this fucking creates like a freaky

218
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,900
that I can really work with.

219
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,500
Hotel 39 year old.

220
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,334
Crazy wall.

221
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,223
Yes.

222
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,091
Yes.

223
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,920
Look at my ass like work out all the time.

224
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,110
That's fantastic.

225
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,281
I like,

226
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:52,114
I'm old,

227
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,370
not even old old.

228
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,653
That's young for me.

229
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,231
So,

230
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:57,650
um,

231
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,790
you're coming down the hill,

232
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,110
you're totally naked.

233
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,670
You're high as a kite on mushrooms.

234
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,210
Do whatever.

235
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,781
Any point.

236
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,560
Realize like you starting to
sober up at any point in time.

237
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:07,120
Like what's,

238
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,360
what's happening as you're sobering up,

239
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,690
what was happening as I was sobering up
and because I'm such a freak because I

240
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:14,600
had read a lot about how when you
can be on a mountain in the summer,

241
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,060
winter storm can brew up,

242
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,141
right?

243
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,030
They can pick up,

244
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,110
you can get caught in hailstorms,

245
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,210
freeze to death actually sometimes,

246
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,020
you know?

247
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,651
And so,

248
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:25,070
uh,

249
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,903
I was like,

250
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,773
I was like,

251
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,300
I got to get the phone
and I'd read about k two,

252
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,610
and I don't know if he ever
read about climbing k two.

253
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,200
It's one thing to climb Mount Everest.

254
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,180
It's quite another thing that can't climb.

255
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,050
K Two I believe there's only
one side of k two one can climb.

256
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,180
And for a while I believe in,

257
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:44,120
you can check this on fact
check one in four people,

258
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,540
uh,

259
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,650
wouldn't make it.

260
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,280
Uh,

261
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,570
uh,

262
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,520
on k two people died all the time
because people would make it.

263
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,370
Can you do fact check?

264
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,380
Cause I believe that was
the case for quite awhile.

265
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,360
She's cranky.

266
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,270
And so what happened was it was the holy
grail of mountains still is cause uh,

267
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,960
cause um,

268
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,560
what happens is storms whip
up really fucking fast.

269
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,800
Like really fast and a and you die.

270
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,750
Yeah.

271
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,070
So,

272
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,770
so what happened was I,

273
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,400
um,

274
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,550
I started thinking of storm might
whip up and I suck in the cold.

275
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,450
Whoa.

276
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,650
What does it say on fact check?

277
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,591
Um,

278
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:18,820
it's just talking about there was a,

279
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,230
there's been a bunch of disasters.

280
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:20,841
Oh,

281
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,410
a lot of people have died on Kaytoo.

282
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,581
You don't climb k,

283
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:24,810
two very few people.

284
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,080
Client.

285
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,120
When you meet a mountain
climber and they said,

286
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,990
I got to the top of k two that
dude is on the all star team.

287
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,590
Wow.

288
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,330
That's a very rare dude.

289
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,280
And you have to go through Pakistan,

290
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:36,750
I think on the Pakistan side.

291
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,273
Yeah.

292
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,233
No bodies and you,

293
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,800
you pass bodies all the time.

294
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,141
You know,

295
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:41,860
it's hilarious.

296
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,250
The United States just got word from
Afghanistan that if we go to war with

297
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:45,821
Pakistan,

298
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:47,680
Afghanistan is on Pax dead side.

299
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,593
What a surprise.

300
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,520
Out of all the fucking to
all the bullshit propaganda,

301
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:56,380
pretending that we're helping
those people were all,

302
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:56,691
come on,

303
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:57,690
we're on your side.

304
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,533
We're pride.

305
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,640
We're extracting minerals,

306
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:00,901
blah,

307
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:01,031
blah,

308
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:01,341
blah.

309
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:02,111
Taking heroin.

310
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:03,280
But we're here for you.

311
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:07,030
We're bribing fucking entire tribes
to have loyalty to like Kabul.

312
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,550
They're getting information on these guys.

313
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:11,860
You know the number one
method for these warlords?

314
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,080
No Viagra.

315
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,471
Oh,

316
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:14,101
that's right.

317
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:14,970
I read about that.

318
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,183
That's right.

319
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,400
Hey,

320
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,821
I know you,

321
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:20,760
I know you have all these loyalties
you want a hard on for a long time.

322
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,490
Oh,

323
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,323
of course.

324
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:22,931
Yeah.

325
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:23,621
Well these guys,

326
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:24,370
he's warlords.

327
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,480
They start hitting 50 and 60 and then
you're fucking hurt and goats all day.

328
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:29,081
You're tired,

329
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:29,291
man.

330
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,810
You can't take to those 20
wives that you've accumulated.

331
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,100
You got cocky when you were young.

332
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,181
When you're young,

333
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:34,790
you're young.

334
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,770
My blood is hot.

335
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,780
You could have 10 fucking wives,

336
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:39,400
but then when you're a 60 year old man,

337
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:40,750
you've got to fuck 10 of these bitches.

338
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,550
They started talking shit to him,

339
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,930
it's actually four in Islam,

340
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,510
you have to treat all of
them exactly the same.

341
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,450
So if they had four though and one
of them was getting all the deck,

342
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,940
that's I the other ones,

343
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:51,774
start complaining.

344
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,340
It's the craziest thing because
I've never met two women.

345
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,353
Two women,

346
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,910
like four women get along.

347
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,810
My friend cat watch.

348
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,130
When a girl girls were really good.

349
00:08:59,131 --> 00:08:59,700
Here's the good news.

350
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,510
I'm marrying you.

351
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:00,991
Bad News.

352
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,280
We're all gonna share the same roof.

353
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,150
Fucking luck.

354
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,930
How are they doing it in
the Mormon communities?

355
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,510
All these crazy Mormon cults,

356
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,081
they don't.

357
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,760
It's always been very small subsets,

358
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,680
and if you look at who
those cult leaders are,

359
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,900
they're basically class Jeffrey's tops.

360
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:13,231
Again,

361
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:14,490
closet perverts,

362
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,480
sociopath,

363
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,313
pedophiles,

364
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,281
scumbags.

365
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:18,790
That Guy Warren Jeffs was a pedophile.

366
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,681
Totally right.

367
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:22,020
And that it is a sort
of part of the kinks,

368
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:22,191
right?

369
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:23,790
They always find out that
these guys are marrying,

370
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,440
these girls were like 14 and shit.

371
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,020
They keep finding that younger,

372
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:28,500
younger,

373
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,080
really nice guys.

374
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:31,420
Yeah.

375
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,221
It's just weird,

376
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:32,401
man.

377
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,450
A weird offshoot.

378
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,860
You know that it's just,

379
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,940
it's just so strange.

380
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:40,140
It's some people vibrate on a frequency
that low their bullshit detectors that

381
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:44,700
week that they get sucked into that kind
of a community perspective and context.

382
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:44,971
I mean,

383
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:47,430
when you get somebody who's young
and they've never been told anything

384
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:47,821
different,

385
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:48,090
you know,

386
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,810
we're just,

387
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,220
you look at children with people,

388
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:50,431
you're,

389
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:50,661
you're,

390
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:52,050
you are what you get.

391
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,420
What put what's put inside you.

392
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:53,890
You need,

393
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,240
you need.

394
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,370
That's why I always tell
young people fucking read,

395
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:59,730
but read the right things and what
you don't know it's going to hurt you.

396
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:00,540
You've got to read.

397
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,650
You just gotta you gotta.

398
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,060
Did you,

399
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,490
have you seen the Zike
guys to moving forward?

400
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,090
No,

401
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,781
I haven't either.

402
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,040
I haven't watched the whole thing,

403
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,360
but I watched a chunk of it.

404
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:11,730
People just constantly trying
to get me to see this thing.

405
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,280
It's one of those things where
people email me once a day,

406
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,551
dude,

407
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,870
have you seen Zike guys moving forward?

408
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:16,150
And I'm like,

409
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,920
Oh,

410
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,790
I saw the first Zeit geist and
although I thought it was very moving,

411
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,300
I also thought there was like,

412
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,490
there's this some stuff on
nine 11 that I was like,

413
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,031
this is,

414
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:27,990
you're just you,

415
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,330
you,

416
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:28,681
you know.

417
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,150
There was stuff about the twin towers,

418
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,880
like they couldn't have
possibly fallen like that.

419
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,211
And I'm like,

420
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:33,810
listen man,

421
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,280
this is not real science.

422
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:35,970
This is,

423
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,290
you don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

424
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,680
This is the end to say this to state
that for sure that happened I think is

425
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,360
crazy.

426
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,540
Well,

427
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:41,850
you know,

428
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,560
here's the only way to find out,

429
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,880
build the same fucking thing.

430
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,530
I have another fucking plane fly into it.

431
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,730
Let's see if it falls down again.

432
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,564
If it does,

433
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,230
Ooh,

434
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,400
you just fucked up.

435
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,160
If you actually want a really
good a debunking of that.

436
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,670
Um,

437
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,130
popular mechanics got together a whole
bunch of mechanical engineering science

438
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,110
called debunking the nine one
one myths and they talk about,

439
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:01,681
for example,

440
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:02,290
how care,

441
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,730
um,

442
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,070
jet fuel burns at a certain
temperature and what,

443
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:08,580
and I believe it's 1600 degrees
iron melts at 900 degrees,

444
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:09,570
especially that kind of iron.

445
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,050
So it made sense that the iron would
start to melt and the building would

446
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:13,350
crumble.

447
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,940
But they had a whole bunch of different,

448
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,630
they actually took each and it's a really
interesting bullying that's annoying

449
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,080
when you read the arguments
against it because some of the,

450
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,880
the information that people
pull out is just flat out wrong.

451
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,930
Like they're talking about how there's
cuts to the beams and you want to say,

452
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,853
look folks,

453
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,400
they cut the beams when they needed to
break everything down because they were

454
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,270
clearing out the area.

455
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,740
There's a lot of photographs in that man.

456
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,010
You,

457
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,450
there's no evidence that they cut the
beams to bring the fucking building down

458
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:41,130
lanes.

459
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:41,963
A lot of,

460
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,680
a lot easier to believe that a group of,

461
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:44,910
of,

462
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,820
of young men who are fanatics said,

463
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:48,510
you know what?

464
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,140
Let's let's fly planes into a building
that seems more than some huge and

465
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:54,160
massive government

466
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,880
conspiracy.

467
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,930
Think how many people would have
to keep their mouth shut again,

468
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,870
something like that going not just that,

469
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,960
but that,

470
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,710
that's the only way of
building like that can fall.

471
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,990
I really don't think that they have,

472
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,221
uh,

473
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:07,930
a lot of data on what the fuck happens.

474
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,730
The skyscrapers and they get hit by giant.

475
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,331
She didn't say,

476
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,520
I didn't know you got your
degree in mechanical engineering,

477
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,120
my friend.

478
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,751
That's exactly,

479
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,620
every time I hear somebody,

480
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,550
people are full of medical advice as well.

481
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:17,081
I love this.

482
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:17,980
If you read a lot of stuff,

483
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:18,810
for example,

484
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,050
what,

485
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,380
what people will tell you there was a,

486
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:22,090
there's a good ted lecture by this,

487
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:25,810
a epidemiologist who's a scientist
and put actually does science,

488
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,770
does the science on,

489
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,521
for example,

490
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:32,170
when they said that up glass of red
wine a day can help you prevent breast

491
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:32,980
cancer.

492
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,280
The problem with that statement that
you read in the New York Times and

493
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:40,810
everywhere else is that the actual
experiment was they had cancer cells in a

494
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:41,740
petri dish.

495
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,340
They dropped red grape
extract onto the cancer cells.

496
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,870
Those cancer cells died.

497
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,321
You'd,

498
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:48,071
that doesn't mean,

499
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:48,251
yeah,

500
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:52,990
you don't is what it is a right,

501
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,730
right,

502
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,563
right.

503
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,840
But you don't,

504
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,060
that doesn't mean you infer
then that a glass of wine,

505
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:58,520
it's going to kill,

506
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,000
you know,

507
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,833
it's going to prevent

508
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,490
kinds of breast cancer by the way,

509
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,080
and cancer itself as an umbrella term
for essentially the irregular division of

510
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:08,914
cells,

511
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,600
all different kinds of cancer.

512
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,570
We don't know why some kick on
some happen when you're a child.

513
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,890
Others when you're an adult,

514
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,540
there are different theories about it.

515
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,000
Some are environmental summer genetic.

516
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,500
So you know,

517
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,850
and by the way,

518
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,430
when people say you got to
build your immune system,

519
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,360
then if you drink this,

520
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:26,830
it'll prevent cancer.

521
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,703
In fact,

522
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,210
uh,

523
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,830
I was reading that some,

524
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,780
some cancers don't actually grow as a
result of a stronger immune system because

525
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,400
they are,

526
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,180
they are aligned with your immune system.

527
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,040
When your immune system is strong for
whatever reason and cell start dividing in

528
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:42,820
a healthy way,

529
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,980
the unhealthy cells do as well.

530
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,501
So,

531
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:45,801
so,

532
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:46,490
so there are,

533
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,560
depending on the cancer,

534
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,070
which is why they use chemotherapy of
poisons your whole body and that's his off

535
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,260
the cancer cells right
before it kills off you.

536
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,010
That's right.

537
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,430
That's right.

538
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,750
And you remember some,

539
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,210
some cancer intuitive to
the holistic approach.

540
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:00,680
There was like super healthy
Greens and stuff like that.

541
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,481
You want to be healthy.

542
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:02,380
I take all that stuff.

543
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:02,921
I do that.

544
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:03,371
But yeah,

545
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:06,160
I mean we don't forget what
western science has given us.

546
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:06,700
Look,

547
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,040
up until the 1970s,

548
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,731
late seventies,

549
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:12,880
I believe a testicular
cancer killed many young men.

550
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:13,960
When you had testicular cancer,

551
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:14,794
you were done.

552
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,580
Okay.

553
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,510
But because they came up with a
chemotherapy that ha that uses,

554
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,443
um,

555
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,701
yeah,

556
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:22,240
right.

557
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,721
That's probably,

558
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:23,650
that's what they used to do.

559
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,410
But you,

560
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,340
you had things called,

561
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,020
but there were,

562
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,420
there was,

563
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:26,870
um,

564
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,410
um,

565
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,950
there's a platinum compound
in the chemotherapy.

566
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:30,821
It is,

567
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:31,630
it has made,

568
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:31,990
um,

569
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,830
testicular cancer,

570
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,210
highly curable.

571
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,531
Most,

572
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:37,300
almost always when you
get to stick a look,

573
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:40,330
cancer young men live
now budget they take,

574
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:40,961
they take chemo,

575
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:43,960
they're sick for a little bit and then
it just goes away and it's curative.

576
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,100
So you know,

577
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:45,911
you gotta be careful,

578
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,020
you're right with people,

579
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,170
have a lot of information and if you
actually start scratching the surface and

580
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,010
asking them questions,

581
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,531
it's like,

582
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:51,820
dude,

583
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,653
you don't,

584
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,290
where are you getting your information?

585
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,480
Do you know the genealogy of your idea?

586
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,620
Did you study?

587
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:57,991
Do you,

588
00:14:57,991 --> 00:14:58,711
do you know what?

589
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:02,460
Too many people are just too quick to
just grab a hold of a yes or a no or this

590
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:03,430
side or that side.

591
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:04,530
And you've got to look at the whole thing.

592
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,430
You know the,

593
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,010
the only thing that puzzles me about
September 11th is that the sat that uh,

594
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,260
tower seven building,

595
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,150
and there's a lot of debate on that.

596
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:15,450
That's the one that the architects and
engineers from nine 11 truth have a

597
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:16,170
problem with.

598
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,570
They don't know why that building
collapse like that and it looks like a

599
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,404
controlled demolition.

600
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,160
That's really interesting.

601
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,900
I've seen a bunch of them.

602
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,071
It's,

603
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,980
it's very interesting because I'd never
seen a building fall into its base like

604
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:26,221
that.

605
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:28,200
Like give out in uniform and
come down a straight line.

606
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,330
But it doesn't mean that it can't happen.

607
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,990
Right.

608
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,490
It's gotta be real careful about that.

609
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,160
Yeah,

610
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,280
it looks like a controlled
demolition and you know,

611
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:39,060
you've hear that this Larry Silverstein
guy had all this money invested in it

612
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:39,601
and when the,

613
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:39,811
you know,

614
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:40,680
if the buildings went down,

615
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:43,530
he made billions of dollars and
you hear all this craziness online.

616
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,570
But the,

617
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,930
the real reality is,

618
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,560
again,

619
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,580
we don't know how a building like that
performs until something like that

620
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:51,030
happens.

621
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,620
You got to light it on fire.

622
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,300
You got to make big holes in it.

623
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:54,841
Yeah.

624
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:57,570
And the other thing is nobody ever
realizes that these are people,

625
00:15:57,571 --> 00:15:57,841
right?

626
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:58,621
So if you look at,

627
00:15:58,621 --> 00:15:59,051
like if you,

628
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:00,590
if you read like Bob Woodward's though,

629
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,190
are you looking at how like governments,

630
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,300
the CIA,

631
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,540
this defense intelligence and
the national security agency,

632
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,583
the White House,

633
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,061
if you,

634
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,210
if there's a crisis,

635
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,330
it's really interesting to see and if
you look at these memoirs now that are

636
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:14,320
coming up about,

637
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:15,154
about the Bush era,

638
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,760
it's really interesting to
see how they do arrive at,

639
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,300
at,

640
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,730
at conclusions and
decisions to take action.

641
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,820
It's fucking heated in those rooms.

642
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,200
And like human beings,

643
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,910
everybody's got a different point of view.

644
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,810
Everybody has their own group
of people they control and,

645
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,210
and it comes down ultimately to date.

646
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,920
Everybody presents their
case to the present,

647
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:36,581
biting their lip,

648
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:37,990
having testy arguments,

649
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,010
not talking to each other,

650
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,560
threatening to resign like
Condoleezza Rice did with,

651
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:44,200
with the Donald Rumsfeld cause she
just didn't get along with him.

652
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,340
She thought he was condescending,

653
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:46,150
et cetera.

654
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,650
And the president and
finally has to be like,

655
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:48,100
guys,

656
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,460
guys,

657
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,840
can you,

658
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,150
hey,

659
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,560
let's not stop fighting.

660
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,310
Stop it.

661
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,600
I'm the one who makes the decision,

662
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,460
ultimately present your idea to me.

663
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,930
Way Scarier is the idea that we actually
let a guy like Bush really be president

664
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,850
to me is way scarier than the idea that
there's some massive conspiracy amongst

665
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:06,090
globalist to control all the resources.

666
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,760
But my fact that a guy really could be
president and they really don't have it

667
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:10,594
locked down.

668
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,613
Totally.

669
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,131
It's true.

670
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,250
Like I know it's not pushing
to have a lot of wisdom.

671
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,450
He didn't have to,

672
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:16,901
he was there.

673
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:17,730
He's a puppet.

674
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,310
They obviously had Dick Cheney and Dick
Cheney was a guy who was the fucking CEO

675
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:22,144
of Halliburton,

676
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,481
uh,

677
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:27,460
a company that made untold billions of
dollars reconstruct and countries after

678
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:28,810
we blow them the fuck up.

679
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,010
It's not a coincidence at this guy would
be really fascinated with going to war.

680
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,401
I mean,

681
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:34,840
he owed own stock.

682
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,131
The president,

683
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:39,580
President Bush was a fucking
character on a sitcom for us.

684
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:39,960
Listen,

685
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,810
calm guy that spoke for us,

686
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,270
Condoleezza Rice had a huge

687
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,330
falling out with Dick Cheney and a huge,

688
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:50,331
huge arguments about the fact that
the guy believed in a extraordinary,

689
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:52,050
I think it's called
extraordinary rendition,

690
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,480
where we would kidnap people,

691
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,680
kidnap people,

692
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,410
and take them to undisclosed locations,

693
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,850
usually a country they didn't object
to torture and a and put them in these

694
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:03,631
detention cells,

695
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:04,740
the CIA prisons.

696
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,873
And she was like,

697
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,700
you can't just disappear
people you can't do that.

698
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,490
Can't you can't take somebody off the
streets of Italy and bring them to the

699
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,010
Turkey.

700
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,520
There's certain people
that have an unquestionable
character to certain people.

701
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:16,930
You hear him talk and you say,

702
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,180
that's a man of character.

703
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,440
That's amount of intelligence.

704
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:21,730
That's amount of experience.

705
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,360
Yeah.

706
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,770
Colin Powell is one of those people.

707
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,450
I hear that guy talk and I go,

708
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:26,410
that guy's legit.

709
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,240
That's the real also against the Iraq war.

710
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:28,961
Yes he was.

711
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:29,521
And he was like,

712
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:29,680
oh,

713
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,970
did anytime in uniform.

714
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,450
Yes.

715
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,590
And he was also,

716
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,573
you know,

717
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,750
disenchanted with the
entire administration and it
didn't really work out for

718
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:36,881
him.

719
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:37,390
And you know,

720
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,760
everybody was real excited when
he joined the Bush administration.

721
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,781
But you know,

722
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:44,710
there's a guide that really
is a real American hero.

723
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,320
He's the,

724
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,641
these,

725
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:46,630
the real fucking deal.

726
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,930
And he's with all these jackasses and
war criminals and fucking thieves and he

727
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:55,090
has to sit there and watch them pillage,

728
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,860
just pillage the world.

729
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,890
Those motherfuckers well

730
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,810
till too seriously.

731
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,920
But I think that it's worth
being serious about that.

732
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,750
You know,

733
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,021
it is,

734
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,580
but it isn't because it's
not helping anything.

735
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:09,960
No,

736
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,230
but,

737
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,660
but no,

738
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,230
like I have a joke about occupy Wall
Street and I totally support the movement,

739
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:16,390
but the joke is that those hippies
are just going to start living there.

740
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:18,310
Now what's going to happen
is you're going to go there,

741
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,500
everyone's just going to be shitting
all over the street and you just have to

742
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:21,780
just drive through that
all the way to work.

743
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,390
Hey Man,

744
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,290
will you doing is wrong man.

745
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,560
Well,

746
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,880
nothing ever changes ever.

747
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:28,370
And that's the thing I was talking to
Neil and Neil Brennan was telling kind of

748
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:28,660
like,

749
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,320
give me a hard time for not,

750
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:30,650
not.

751
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:30,921
Um,

752
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:31,671
I disagree with them.

753
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,211
On a lot of things.

754
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:32,690
But um,

755
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,020
he was,

756
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,260
he,

757
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,860
but I respect meal because he works very
hard at earning and opinion developing

758
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:37,480
an opinion.

759
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,030
We are,

760
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,863
we're on a bit,

761
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,880
I think we're on different
sides of the equation but,

762
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,780
but Neil,

763
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,613
Neil,

764
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,410
Neil was saying you should
be down there protesting.

765
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,360
And my problem with the protest movement,

766
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:51,320
the occupy Wall Street
movement is that I don't,

767
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,130
I don't know that that's the
only group to play there.

768
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,180
There are a lot of groups
to plan the government,

769
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,170
Wall Street,

770
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,370
irregular consumers that were buying
houses and knowing they couldn't afford

771
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:01,461
them.

772
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:02,870
Nobody ever talks about that.

773
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:03,510
And,

774
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,940
and,

775
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,230
and so there and so when
you occupy Wall Street,

776
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:07,610
what you're really talking
about Wall Street of course,

777
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:11,870
just a euphemism or just a kind of a name
for I very amorphous group of people.

778
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,990
Because what you're talking about
when you talk about Wall Street is the

779
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,010
investment community.

780
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,810
That's what you're talking about now.

781
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:19,940
Do you want to protest
the investment community?

782
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,751
If so,

783
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:22,010
let me ask some questions.

784
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,020
What aspect of the investment community,

785
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:27,200
cause I would remind everybody
they pay a lot in taxes.

786
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,150
They also produce a lot of wealth.

787
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,780
You wouldn't have startup companies
without venture capital for example.

788
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,160
You want to start taxing,

789
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:34,800
uh,

790
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,270
uh,

791
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,940
you know,

792
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,540
um,

793
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,760
the capital gains tax,

794
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,510
see what happens to your venture catalyst.

795
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:39,651
He's,

796
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:42,410
we'll see what happens to capital
that is invested in businesses.

797
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:43,850
So I don't know the answers.

798
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,410
These are complicated issues.

799
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,710
And you start following that
thread and start saying,

800
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:47,861
well,

801
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,060
let's occupy Wall Street.

802
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,960
Okay,

803
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,440
okay.

804
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,510
There are some unscrupulous
assholes and Wall Street.

805
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,350
There's no doubt.

806
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,273
There's no doubt.

807
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,910
But,

808
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,260
but what are we going to do about it?

809
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:56,800
I would,

810
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I believe personally that you had an
incentive structure in place and incentive

811
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:07,360
structure and a system with holes in
it where smart people got together and

812
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:07,660
said,

813
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:07,901
hey,

814
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:08,734
you know what?

815
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,870
I got to tell you this.

816
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:15,460
There are some very big legal loopholes
here and we can make a lot of money.

817
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:15,731
You know,

818
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,330
why?

819
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,720
Because three other houses down the
way or making a shitload of money.

820
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,760
So what are we doing guys?

821
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:22,900
Cause we're not gonna be able to compete.

822
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:23,734
Here's another thing,

823
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,200
we may be out of a fucking
job if we don't do this.

824
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,070
So there were,

825
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,710
so when you're in that and
you start to realize it,

826
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,810
it's really an interesting
development where you go,

827
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:32,051
Gee,

828
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:32,860
what would I,

829
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,540
what would I do in that situation as well?

830
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,320
It was so,

831
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,370
it was so fucking murky and it seems to
me what you want to fix is the incentive

832
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:39,761
structure.

833
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:40,594
Do you want to fix,

834
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,050
you want to go back to two nuts and bolts,

835
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,890
nuts and bolts.

836
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,910
What are you producing?

837
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:47,260
What is the bottom line?

838
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,820
How do you produce wealth?

839
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,680
What does produce wealth in the past?

840
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,310
And,

841
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,030
and um,

842
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,060
she may have been making money off just
making money and moving money around,

843
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,170
passing risk along.

844
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:56,990
Remember,

845
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,690
remember even much bigger than the
actual size of the actual economy as he,

846
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,160
there's a bus of the derivatives,

847
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:03,460
right?

848
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:03,910
Yes.

849
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,091
And,

850
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:04,291
and,

851
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,430
and there's a very good
book that I'm about to read.

852
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:08,950
And I had two very big
bankers who are in this,

853
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:13,390
who were in this and had lived
through it and saw every bit,

854
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:14,021
every detail.

855
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:14,351
And they said,

856
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:16,690
the book to read is the
big short by Michael Lewis.

857
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,860
He wrote Liar's poker.

858
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,930
It's would like to read this
book called the big short,

859
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,990
really for anybody.

860
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,970
It'll explain the genesis and,

861
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:25,670
and this guy is,

862
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,860
and is not,

863
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,360
it doesn't have a grind to acts here.

864
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:28,601
He's,

865
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:28,740
uh,

866
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,320
he's,

867
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,290
he is a journalist who is a
outstanding FirstClass writer.

868
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,130
I read liar's poker.

869
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:34,300
He's a great writer.

870
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,040
I believe it's Michael Lewis is his name.

871
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,090
I might be wrong with the first name,

872
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:38,950
but the point is that
he wrote the big short,

873
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,270
and that is renowned,

874
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:40,511
that is,

875
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:44,950
that is widely respected as the book
and sort of the Bible on how the shit

876
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:46,750
happened and what happened.

877
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,670
And essentially who's to blame.

878
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,770
But you start going into that blame game.

879
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:51,730
It's really interesting.

880
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:55,180
It's really fucking interesting because
there are a lot of people and they're

881
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:57,520
not just republicans and
not just libertarians.

882
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,930
A lot of people can make a very strong
case for things like the equal lending,

883
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:02,950
housing lending act,

884
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,830
that the kinds of laws that
came out of government,

885
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,370
because it was very popular in the
Republican and democratic side to say,

886
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,270
Hey,

887
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm going to pass legislation
that makes it easy for everyone.

888
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,770
Own a house.

889
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,540
That's the American way.

890
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,010
That's the American dream.

891
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:18,550
Uh,

892
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,670
they did a study that they that
listen to this really interesting.

893
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:22,250
The first,

894
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,700
the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston did a study.

895
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,970
They found that even if
you're qualified for a loan,

896
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:28,751
if you're a minority,

897
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:29,950
if you're black or Latino,

898
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,380
and even if you're just as
qualified as a white person,

899
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:34,540
you're four times as
likely to be turned down,

900
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,950
turned down for that loan.

901
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,760
Okay?

902
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,440
So if you're black or you're Latino,

903
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,101
back in,

904
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:43,210
I think this was in 1996 or whatever,

905
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:44,080
I don't remember the date.

906
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,680
If you're black and Latino,

907
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,010
you have the

908
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,240
same credit as a white person.

909
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:49,580
You're still four times as likely
to be turned down for a loan.

910
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,250
Countrywide mortgage is all in the family.

911
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,590
Maybe you need it and
then everybody could,

912
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,060
but countrywide Morgan said,

913
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:56,511
fuck this.

914
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:01,100
Let's open a bunch of small offices
with minority people working in there.

915
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:03,470
Let's start giving loans to these people
if they had the same credit rating,

916
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:04,304
let's do that.

917
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,130
It's really interesting when you start
really listening to the shit and you're

918
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:07,311
like,

919
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:07,611
wow,

920
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:07,851
man,

921
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:08,120
this is,

922
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,350
this got this got fucking crazy
on top of the fact that Europe,

923
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,280
the rich countries,

924
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:14,810
we're buying our,

925
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,400
our mortgage back securities,

926
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,760
they were buying the housing
debt and so we could pass it on.

927
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,750
It's just so weird that people thought
that it was normal that you would buy a

928
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:27,280
house and then it would be worth
twice as much in two years.

929
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:27,951
That's what happened.

930
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:28,840
Like what happened to my house,

931
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:29,070
dude,

932
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,191
I,

933
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:30,620
everybody was telling me this dude,

934
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:33,620
I bought it for 500 I sold
it for a mill and I'm like,

935
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:34,210
what?

936
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,590
Yeah,

937
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:34,850
you,

938
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,050
you,

939
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,120
you just made a half a million
dollars just like that.

940
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,300
How the fuck did you do that?

941
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:38,991
How's that happen?

942
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:39,750
How's that real?

943
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,251
My father,

944
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:40,911
who was a banker,

945
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:41,211
said,

946
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:42,290
my father looked at me and he goes,

947
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:42,980
uh,

948
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,890
not going to last because
I was to kind of buy it.

949
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:46,730
I was going to buy a piece of
property getting a real estate.

950
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:47,000
He goes,

951
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,900
you know anything about real estate?

952
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:48,111
And I go,

953
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:48,231
no.

954
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:48,500
He goes,

955
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,520
you're not how to make people laugh,

956
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:49,671
right?

957
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:49,851
I go,

958
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:50,061
yeah.

959
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:50,450
He goes,

960
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,400
stick to making people laugh
because you're going in real estate,

961
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,270
you will lose all your money,

962
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,261
all this route and well,

963
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:54,920
not only that,

964
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,430
right,

965
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,330
don't be cocky and think you can jump
into a game like that and not give it 100%

966
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,164
of your attention.

967
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,260
Like people saying they're
going to moonlight in MMA.

968
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,730
I'm going to have a couple
of fights on the side.

969
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,140
Good luck with the rest of your life.

970
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,820
Thinking out of that
shitty brain of yours,

971
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,550
cause someone's going wrap a fucking Shin
around your skull and you're not gonna

972
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,920
remember things too good after that.

973
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,793
And then the hardest,

974
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,451
I'm sorry,

975
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:16,130
but that is the hardest
way to earn a living.

976
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,660
So I walked up there,

977
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,760
I watch these guys fight and you know,

978
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:20,594
and I was watching,

979
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,460
I was watching baseball the other day.

980
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:24,200
I'm watching the world
series and you know,

981
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:24,621
baseball,

982
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:25,161
they're athletes,

983
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,210
they can hit a ball.

984
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:26,471
You know,

985
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:27,780
you've got to swing the bat perfectly.

986
00:25:27,781 --> 00:25:28,311
You've got to throw,

987
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,570
you've got to feel the ball and it's,

988
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:29,811
you know,

989
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:31,860
there's a lot of skill
involved in baseball but,

990
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,880
but when it comes to fighting and you're
out there with gloves that are just

991
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:37,820
tiny and you and somebody else is trying
to knock your fucking head off and you

992
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:41,090
have to know how to kick punch and
Russell so much more difficult,

993
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:42,520
so much more as on lawn,

994
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,373
physically,

995
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:43,791
your,

996
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:44,750
your physical health,

997
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,620
your playing a game,

998
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:48,800
how much your courage or your mind,

999
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,000
you gotta stay loose but aggressive and
you're going to be exposed in front of

1000
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:53,834
all these people.

1001
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,690
You're gonna people are
gonna see you break,

1002
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,600
what would you not,

1003
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,090
you probably are not allowed
to even say this cause you,

1004
00:25:59,091 --> 00:25:59,841
you call the fights.

1005
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:00,470
But if,

1006
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,970
if you had to put,

1007
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,440
I don't know if it's a fair question,

1008
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:07,040
I was you about the stone and Anderson
Silva fight or are they gonna fight first

1009
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:07,221
of all,

1010
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:07,700
do we know?

1011
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,300
Who knows?

1012
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,901
I don't know.

1013
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:09,380
I'm a,

1014
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,550
Dana likes the fight.

1015
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:12,470
It's a promotable fight for sure.

1016
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,610
It's a very exciting fight.

1017
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:15,500
Anderson kind of hesitant to fight him.

1018
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:16,251
I don't believe so.

1019
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:18,590
I believe his manager
has said some things,

1020
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:19,281
but you know,

1021
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,570
a lot of that is just a,

1022
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,441
it's a,

1023
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:22,250
it's a game.

1024
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:22,491
You know,

1025
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:24,080
you got to realize that promotion,

1026
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,360
uh,

1027
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,193
you know,

1028
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,660
managing fighters and stuff,

1029
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:28,730
there's a lot of publicity
involved and there's a lot of,

1030
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,830
just keeping it in the
press is a good thing.

1031
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,930
Saying the child doesn't
deserve it as a good thing.

1032
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:35,420
Building up any sort of
animosity is a good thing.

1033
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,141
And then sales people.

1034
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:36,510
So yes,

1035
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,343
she does deserve it.

1036
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,720
Anderson's where he's
going to kick his ass.

1037
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,410
Then you got,

1038
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,340
you got a thread going,

1039
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:40,611
man.

1040
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:41,300
So you can't,

1041
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,290
he can't be a rube.

1042
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,130
You've got to look at
these things and go listen

1043
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,930
and sores is a smart dude.

1044
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,380
And Anderson Silva is a goddamn genius
and chill son and is the greatest

1045
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:53,040
marketing mind that combat sports
has ever known by a long shot.

1046
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,750
No one's funny than him.

1047
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,340
No one wanted me to hear that in him.

1048
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:57,000
He's a beast.

1049
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,620
I watched him and I get depressed it,

1050
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,230
I'm not helping what
he said to Brian Stann.

1051
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:00,451
He said,

1052
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:03,660
he is an American hero and he's going
to get a good old fashioned red,

1053
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:04,880
white and blue ass kicking.

1054
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,510
It was so great.

1055
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:07,931
I saw,

1056
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:09,190
I'm talking about the nuclear brothers.

1057
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,260
He's on another level.

1058
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,340
It's talking about the Nogueira brothers.

1059
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:14,120
It's like they thought that's possible
that they thought it was a rocky

1060
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,560
[inaudible] interview with a man.

1061
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:15,811
He's,

1062
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:17,700
he's saying give them a carrot.

1063
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,470
I brought it up to him.

1064
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:19,681
He goes,

1065
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,514
that happened.

1066
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,480
He goes,

1067
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,850
one of them pull this belt off
like he's going to take it home.

1068
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,850
Come on little fella and
you know I'm white dude.

1069
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:27,661
On top of that.

1070
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:29,670
Then motherfucker could fight his ass off.

1071
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,370
If he was just a shit talker,

1072
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,530
I would still love him,

1073
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,440
so I'd be lost.

1074
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,280
Everything like Sean McCorkle has lost
a couple of times in the UFC and you

1075
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:38,491
know,

1076
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,870
or at least once in the o Sing Sha.

1077
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,920
Sorry Sean for I said one,

1078
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,900
but he's a great shit talker.

1079
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,240
He's a hilarious shit talker.

1080
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:44,550
I'm like,

1081
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,830
I like to see the guy back just
to hear him talk some more shit.

1082
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,020
You know,

1083
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,080
Shell's son and talk shit.

1084
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,900
Anybody funnier than I
am and I'm a comedian.

1085
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:52,141
I'm like,

1086
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:52,261
Hey,

1087
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:53,094
this guy's got,

1088
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,670
he's figured out how to finish guys
instead of just staying on top of guys and

1089
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:57,570
punched him in the face.

1090
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:57,891
You know,

1091
00:27:57,891 --> 00:27:59,130
you can win a fight like that,

1092
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:00,060
but you know what else you can do.

1093
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,610
You can lose a fight like that cause
the guy survives and catches you in a

1094
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:04,500
submission when you're on top of a guy.

1095
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:05,430
If you're a wrestler,

1096
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:08,790
the kind of caliber of [inaudible]
and you're not going to get up,

1097
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:09,150
man.

1098
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,970
The only way you're going to get up as
he's going to make it subtle mistake it

1099
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:13,260
probably late in the fight.

1100
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:13,681
You know,

1101
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:16,610
maybe he's trying to finish you
off and he gets cocky and you,

1102
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,450
you get an under hook and
you get back up to your feet.

1103
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:21,630
But for the most part a guy that can
keep you down and if he's got good

1104
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:22,464
submissions,

1105
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,011
fuck,

1106
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:24,060
why would he have good submissions?

1107
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:24,490
What?

1108
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,120
Look at the elite level grappling he has.

1109
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,300
All you have to do is just teach them
a few different positions and he'll be

1110
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:31,680
elite in those positions as well.

1111
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,890
And his triangle that he hit Brian Stann
with was a crusher dude because Brian

1112
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,160
Stan was defending the right way.

1113
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,230
The way to defend is called
like answering the phone,

1114
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:43,500
you put your hand over your ear and
it relieves some of the pressure.

1115
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,321
But chill,

1116
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:48,090
squeeze is so fucking tight
that it didn't matter.

1117
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,730
He did everything perfect.

1118
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,660
He's he just positional a will,

1119
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:52,830
Willa strong gorilla,

1120
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:53,730
strong end,

1121
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,560
mentally tough as fuck.

1122
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,870
He's tough as fuck and has crack in the
past and it's tougher because of it.

1123
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,120
How about that has quit in the past,

1124
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,570
had,

1125
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,710
has done things in the past that he's
not happy with and those things motivate

1126
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:09,960
him in a fight and much
like George Saint Pierre,

1127
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:13,740
I think losing and cracking under
pressure makes them more dangerous.

1128
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,421
I really do.

1129
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,660
When a guy's been humiliated a couple
of times and then he comes back and is a

1130
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:19,494
fucking Badass.

1131
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,530
There's a different level of
intensity that those guys have.

1132
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,960
A guy's been humiliated
like a George Saint Pierre.

1133
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,561
There's a,

1134
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:28,620
there's an intensity that he brings to
the table where this is not going to

1135
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:29,790
fucking happen again.

1136
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,450
That's also on the menu on the
menu is I'm going to kick your ass.

1137
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:33,870
I'm on.

1138
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,340
On the menu is I'm going
to force you to fight my,

1139
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,180
my fight,

1140
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,000
but also on the [inaudible] menu is
that Matt Serra fight is not going to

1141
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,040
fucking happen again.

1142
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,340
Salesman caught by
Anderson and a triangle.

1143
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,030
Paula filio caught him in an arm bar,

1144
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,970
but he's a,

1145
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,550
he's a better fighter than back then.

1146
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:49,810
I don't know what's going on.

1147
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,520
I don't know if its consistency,

1148
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,510
intensity.

1149
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,310
I know a lot of his strength resides in
his hair and they think sand delicious

1150
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:58,180
here dude,

1151
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,901
he's a,

1152
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:01,090
he's a fucking most marketable guy ever.

1153
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,841
He's a man.

1154
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,220
He's just,

1155
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,370
he should have his own right where you
can talk radio show when you're a man and

1156
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:06,071
you're watching the guy,

1157
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:06,510
you're like,

1158
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,343
Aye.

1159
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,220
He's definitely the silver
back and I'm a backbone.

1160
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,710
I'll throw fruit from the tree
and he's entertaining as hell.

1161
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:12,011
Man,

1162
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:12,670
he said was saying,

1163
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,031
Larry,

1164
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:13,840
this is great.

1165
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,330
I'm a big fan of that guy so
that's going to be a big fight.

1166
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,181
The rematch,

1167
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:17,380
those,

1168
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,970
but Anderson right now is recovering
from a shoulder injury and that's tricky

1169
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:22,270
man.

1170
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,650
I mean they can take a long time.

1171
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:26,920
I came to the last it depending on
the severity of Anderson's injury.

1172
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,050
Cain Velasquez has been
out for a long time.

1173
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,750
I mean he had to get surgery and
that's a good solid nine months.

1174
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,430
It's a very complicated joint.

1175
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,293
The shoulder.

1176
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:34,511
I mean,

1177
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:38,770
look at all the different moves that
the shoulder can do and think about how

1178
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,050
loose the tissue has
to be inside of there.

1179
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,280
And if something goes wrong,

1180
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:47,310
if there's tears and soft tissue damage
or worse ligament rips and things that

1181
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:47,831
need,

1182
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:50,860
and you got to go back in there and stitch
everything up and put it together and

1183
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,340
you know,

1184
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,270
possibly even,

1185
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:52,740
you know.

1186
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,140
Yeah.

1187
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,360
And possibly even have
more than one surgery.

1188
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:55,991
Yeah.

1189
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:56,621
I mean there's,

1190
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,320
there's people that have
shoulder injuries and it's nine,

1191
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:00,100
10 months.

1192
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,520
Wow.

1193
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:00,761
Yeah,

1194
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:01,451
it's a long time.

1195
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:03,040
So Kane still hasn't come back yet.

1196
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,750
So he's his junior dos Santos fight is
his first fight back on Fox because he's

1197
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:09,010
been out for Jesus.

1198
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:09,401
It's been to,

1199
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,540
it's got to be like a year.

1200
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,060
He beat Brock Lesner over a year ago,

1201
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:13,691
I believe.

1202
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:13,981
I'm not,

1203
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:15,650
I'm not exactly sure when the,

1204
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:15,740
uh,

1205
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,830
the fight took place.

1206
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,730
He,

1207
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,110
and my opinion is just,

1208
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:25,300
he's the perfect size heavyweight
where he's not a giant guy,

1209
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,640
so he doesn't require
all this amazing oxygen,

1210
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,080
but he's still small.

1211
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:31,380
So can move is always
that debate about what,

1212
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:32,380
what's the perfect size?

1213
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:33,520
Because when you got,

1214
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,180
when you're to 60 you don't have the kind
of explosive speed with your punches.

1215
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,200
He usually got a lot of weight in those
arms to when you fill up with blood man,

1216
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:44,290
you lose the snap into the punches.

1217
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,340
He's got great,

1218
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:48,040
snapped his punches because
he's not muscle balance.

1219
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:48,460
Right?

1220
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,800
He's got a real athlete's body.

1221
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,281
I mean his,

1222
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:56,281
his body is exactly built that way
because of years of combat sports.

1223
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,250
So it's built the exact way it needs to
be to perform at the level that he wants

1224
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:00,661
to pour it.

1225
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:01,450
And with him,

1226
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,500
the big thing with that guy,

1227
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:03,430
his volume,

1228
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,420
he has the most ridiculous pace of any
heavyweight and they never seen a guy

1229
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,254
with cardio.

1230
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:08,951
His ability.

1231
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:09,161
Yeah,

1232
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,690
his cardios was insane.

1233
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:11,710
It doesn't make any sense.

1234
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:16,711
He's 240 pounds and Africa gives out
works Lightweights at the gym at Aka Aka

1235
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,581
American Kickboxing Academy in San Jose.

1236
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:19,930
One of the best gyms in the country,

1237
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,520
filled with killers,

1238
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:21,851
you know,

1239
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:25,780
filled with John Fitch and
Josh Koscheck and Mike Switch.

1240
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:30,130
And all these fucking animals up there
and this guy is outlasting them in in

1241
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,030
conditioning drills.

1242
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,230
That's unheard of.

1243
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,920
You're talking about like a Josh
Thompson like well those kinds,

1244
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,890
that's like an elite,

1245
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,540
elite MMA athlete.

1246
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:37,841
You know,

1247
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:40,250
like as good a shape as you can get an as

1248
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,420
athletic as you can get in and to have
this fucking freak heavyweight beating

1249
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:44,991
them in,

1250
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:45,221
in,

1251
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:46,310
in exercise drills.

1252
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:47,270
It's really kind of crazy.

1253
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,070
Or at least getting close to them.

1254
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,060
Heavyweights are traditionally way easier
to tire out and he just puts a pace on

1255
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:56,690
these guys so you could see them
and just can't believe it's real.

1256
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,920
They can't believe it's real.

1257
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,270
Like a perfect example.

1258
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,980
The Brock Lesnar fight was a good example.

1259
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,911
That was a good example,

1260
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:05,420
but there's been a couple of other
fights in earlier in his career where you

1261
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:08,030
just see him hit guys with this pace.

1262
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,730
I'm a big Ben Rothwell.

1263
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,700
That's a perfect fight.

1264
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,060
He hit Ben Rothwell with this
pace that was just ridiculous.

1265
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,470
It was just ferocious.

1266
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:17,360
Everything he did was perfect.

1267
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,950
Every takedown was perfect.

1268
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,900
Every side positioning was perfect.

1269
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:23,630
Every Hammerfest was perfect
because he wasn't touch was perfect.

1270
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,390
Yeah.

1271
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,350
It just keeps going six feet,

1272
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:28,330
six foot one and Sammy,

1273
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,970
something like that.

1274
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,810
It's not a giant guy.

1275
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,201
Like I said,

1276
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:31,040
he's only two 40.

1277
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,850
Unbelievable.

1278
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,271
He's not a,

1279
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:32,781
he's not a,

1280
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:33,680
might be a little,

1281
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,420
it might be six foot one at the most.

1282
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:35,991
I should,

1283
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:36,830
I should actually look that up.

1284
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:37,664
You can say,

1285
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,190
uh,

1286
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,023
he's Mexican,

1287
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,470
you know his brown pride
tattooed on his chest.

1288
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:42,910
Somebody.

1289
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,030
That's how you know
he's a bad motherfucker.

1290
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,870
I write ca and you in a yacht,

1291
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,310
you know Google and it
says Cain Velasquez.

1292
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,410
That's how you know you're
a bad mother fucker.

1293
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:51,980
Okay.

1294
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,980
Not even Canada or California are
castration or castration or cat cats

1295
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,503
or cats.

1296
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,330
That's what would come up.

1297
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,480
Mine says catch.

1298
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:02,870
I mean you guys,

1299
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,790
I should just say it now.

1300
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,690
I'm a cat free.

1301
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,050
Six foot one six foot one two 44 perfect.

1302
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:08,780
Size heavyweight.

1303
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,101
Not,

1304
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:09,671
not too big.

1305
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:10,504
Not too small.

1306
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,760
And if a guy like Brock
Lesnar can't out muscle you,

1307
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,541
I'm so depressed.

1308
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:18,430
I'm five 11 one 70 but you always say
this but you never do anything about it.

1309
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,361
I lift weights,

1310
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:19,680
dude.

1311
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,700
Do you do heavyweights?

1312
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,151
Like did you,

1313
00:34:22,151 --> 00:34:23,650
do you read Tim Ferriss's book?

1314
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,440
Did you see all this to shut the shit
that he had about gaining weight?

1315
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,170
Yeah,

1316
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,390
but I really want to get bigger.

1317
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,433
You wouldn't be as funny.

1318
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,700
I know that's a problem.

1319
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,360
I don't want to spend that much
time trying to like work on my body.

1320
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,110
It's too embarrassing.

1321
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,990
You would be just as funny.

1322
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:35,824
That's ridiculous.

1323
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,823
But I don't,

1324
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,000
I don't want to spend somehow,

1325
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,670
I don't want to spend a lot of time,

1326
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,570
a lot of time trying to get big and
just swamp 10 pounds more muscular,

1327
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:44,051
tired,

1328
00:34:44,051 --> 00:34:44,300
quick,

1329
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,300
just embarrassing that
I don't get tired quick.

1330
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,470
The real problem with the big muscles
is that you have to feed those bitches.

1331
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,750
You don't realize what a
big difference it makes.

1332
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,480
That's why like,

1333
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:53,670
you know,

1334
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:57,580
you look at the real elite UFC
athletes like Bj Penn and Nick Diaz,

1335
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,200
they don't look like a darkness.

1336
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,060
I was talking to him at
that premiere of warrior.

1337
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,780
I was looking at Bj Penn,

1338
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,340
I was like,

1339
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,820
well,

1340
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,650
you're about as threatening and a
buttoned down shirt as the ups guy.

1341
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,930
You got those ears closed up.

1342
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:11,621
I know what that means,

1343
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:12,490
but I'm looking at him and go on,

1344
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm sorry I'm taller than you.

1345
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:15,880
And frankly my shoulders are broader.

1346
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,590
I,

1347
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,860
that's all I was thinking the
whole time you're sizing them up.

1348
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,950
People must do that to
Bj on a daily basis.

1349
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,970
Nobody dummies.

1350
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:26,110
He wants to have to talk to.

1351
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,850
I just keep looking at him like,

1352
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,490
I mean how were you one of the
baddest man on the planet yet?

1353
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:31,270
He is,

1354
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:31,421
oh,

1355
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:35,170
he's an animal and then I met
Alistair Overeem who was white.

1356
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,960
The opposite elsewhere.

1357
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,460
Overeem is like someone

1358
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,560
gave someone a super person pill.

1359
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,423
I was going to say,

1360
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,490
if you were a character in a comic book
and you know you found a pill was an

1361
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,550
doctor,

1362
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,170
laboratories are spinning
nail impersonator.

1363
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:49,620
That's what he,

1364
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,453
yeah.

1365
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,113
Okay.

1366
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,970
Adam Corolla would say about
women who are really hot,

1367
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:57,301
female,

1368
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:58,290
female impersonators.

1369
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,290
He's a male male.

1370
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,630
I was like looking at his back,

1371
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:01,620
I was grabbing his arm.

1372
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:04,380
I was basically doing everything
but making out with a guy.

1373
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:04,680
I was like,

1374
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,430
ah,

1375
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,250
here's the thing about Alastar
know when since he's been that big,

1376
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,590
no one's had to push him in an MMA fight.

1377
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,401
You know his,

1378
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:15,780
his fights that he's had while he's
been that big or really kickboxing,

1379
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:16,800
he's done very well.

1380
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,720
But I think there's something to that
size in kickbox and that's particularly

1381
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,290
intimidating with the skill
of an ouster over him.

1382
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,710
He's very good at covering up.

1383
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:30,060
He has so much muscle and I think that
muscles also sorta like a padding.

1384
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:30,870
It's like armor.

1385
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,820
My friend Walter say that
when we were doing taekwondo,

1386
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,120
he would say that muscles don't help
you learn that teach out of fight.

1387
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:38,880
But where they do do no doubt
about it is offered protection.

1388
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:39,451
He goes,

1389
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:41,160
they protect you against
injuries and he goes in,

1390
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:42,930
it's padding and you've
got to think of your,

1391
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,120
if your body body's heavily muscled,

1392
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:44,431
it's patty.

1393
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:47,100
There's a certain point in time where
it's a point of diminishing returns.

1394
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:50,760
But the question remains as to whether
Allister's hit that point of diminishing

1395
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:53,520
returns because he's so
big and in kickboxing,

1396
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:56,730
he's a fucking beast and he was a bad
motherfucker when he fought Alster or when

1397
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,930
he fought on Brett Rogers.

1398
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,130
But truth be told,

1399
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:00,810
Brett Rogers is not at his level.

1400
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,970
He's not nearly technical enough,

1401
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,940
standing up to stand with
Allister and you're not going to,

1402
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,290
he's not world class wrestler,

1403
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,580
so he's not going to
take them on the ground.

1404
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,240
He's basically a brawler who was in
there with one of the best precision

1405
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:13,021
strikers in the world.

1406
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,110
So that wasn't exhausting.

1407
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:14,710
Allister,

1408
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,030
Allister Allister's that
wrestling is not that good,

1409
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,830
but he's got real good Jujitsu.

1410
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,390
Wrestling is not good.

1411
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:21,720
He's not,

1412
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,550
he doesn't have the best takedown defense,

1413
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:24,384
but it's good,

1414
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:24,810
you know.

1415
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,710
But the bottom line,

1416
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,510
it says he's got a nasty guillotine choke.

1417
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,051
He choked out.

1418
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:28,920
Vito Belfort with it.

1419
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:29,754
If he tore tapped,

1420
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,481
yeah,

1421
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,410
it caught [inaudible].

1422
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,131
I mean that's how good.

1423
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:33,620
He's a lot taller though.

1424
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:33,990
Yeah.

1425
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,430
Well back then he wasn't back then.

1426
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,960
They were both fighting
around the same way.

1427
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,650
Interesting.

1428
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:37,891
Yeah,

1429
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:40,890
he might have a eat some
good foods and you know,

1430
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:44,490
got a lot of weight put on his body
and my friend people put 35 40 pounds.

1431
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,350
Well he does work hard man.

1432
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,360
His workouts are unbelievable.

1433
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:48,630
There's,

1434
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,830
there's videos of him online,

1435
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:51,870
crazy dead lifts and all
this strength and shit.

1436
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,570
But they're the true test of that.

1437
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,870
Whether or not you could perform with
all that muscle on really is when you get

1438
00:37:57,871 --> 00:38:00,090
stuck under the bottom of
a guy like Brock Lesnar.

1439
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,650
That's the true test.

1440
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,071
You know,

1441
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,760
because that big mother fucker will take
you down and he'll be on top of you and

1442
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:06,151
you might be,

1443
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:06,960
fuck son.

1444
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,700
I think Bronx biggest challenge is
knowing how to a box with a guy like Cain

1445
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,530
Valasquez cause that
takes forever to learn.

1446
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,180
Well because king can wrestle.

1447
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,850
See Cain is a nightmare
because cane can wrestle.

1448
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,460
He started as an excellent wrestler.

1449
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,530
So his technique is a wrestler too.

1450
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,030
He's very technical.

1451
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,200
Like even though he's like,

1452
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,280
he does like a lot of shit.

1453
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:28,380
Like he chains take downs,

1454
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,020
does it in a way that
very few heavyweights do.

1455
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,430
It's like the way he moves.

1456
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:36,010
He's like the way a lighter weight guy
would wrestle and so brings this really

1457
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:37,630
technical wrestling to it too.

1458
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,780
So when Brock starts heaving
and hoeing just a little,

1459
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,720
Kane's got under hook,

1460
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:44,890
she's back up to his feet and boom and
cans all of a sudden kickbox with them,

1461
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:45,670
lighten them up.

1462
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:45,911
His,

1463
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:46,211
his,

1464
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:46,800
you know,

1465
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,320
he's got the worst case
scenario for a guy like Brock.

1466
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,700
He's got nasty standup,

1467
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,870
knocked out Nogueira ridiculous flurry
the way that no one's able to do.

1468
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,171
You know,

1469
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:56,950
he's good man.

1470
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,840
His standup as good
and he can take a shot.

1471
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,710
He took two solid punches from
Czech Congo that dropped him.

1472
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,610
Same kind of punches that knocked Pat
Barry unconscious and he took it right on.

1473
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:09,130
The Chet dropped and then
he completes a takedown.

1474
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,960
That's what's so sick
and amazing about it.

1475
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:12,370
Cut like Frankie Edgar for example,

1476
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:13,690
who is me right now,

1477
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:16,060
the most impressive human being.

1478
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,060
The fact that that guy can
take shots to the face.

1479
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,100
There's a correlation
between both of them.

1480
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,671
Neither one cut.

1481
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:22,090
Wait.

1482
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,160
I was going to say I was gonna.

1483
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,420
I was gonna ask you about that
because when it seems to me,

1484
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:26,590
if a fight's going to go three rounds,

1485
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:27,520
it's one thing to cut weight.

1486
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:29,020
When the fight's going to go five rounds,

1487
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:30,370
cutting weight is,

1488
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,720
is going to be a liability.

1489
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,500
You know,

1490
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,600
usually if the guy,

1491
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,810
the other guy has not cut weight,

1492
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,260
your,

1493
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,130
your muscles and all those cells
are hydrated and you're not gonna,

1494
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,010
you're not gonna get as tired.

1495
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,060
So it's an interesting kind of,

1496
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,150
well,

1497
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,530
you know,

1498
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,100
strategy,

1499
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,400
they re uh,

1500
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,360
they rehydrate with Ivs and it helps,

1501
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,820
it's definitely better than the
way they used to do it guys.

1502
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:49,511
The way they used to do it,

1503
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:53,260
you started eating slowly and then
they would start slowly sipping water.

1504
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,420
Yeah,

1505
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,680
I know.

1506
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,870
Try to get up in the middle of the night
and drink water and they would drink

1507
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:57,040
water and pedialyte.

1508
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,731
But now,

1509
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,040
now that the smart way
to do it is with an ivy,

1510
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:03,400
but there's been some studies
apparently that were done on soldiers.

1511
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,210
Um,

1512
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,320
and I need to get ahold of this.

1513
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:08,620
My friend Dustin told me about it and
they were talking about how long it takes

1514
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:11,620
to rehydrate your cerebral
spinal fluid and all that stuff.

1515
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,210
And that is where it's scary because that
shit takes weeks when you get hit and

1516
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:16,990
you're dehydrated.

1517
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,880
Very bad for your brain,

1518
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,940
very bad for your man.

1519
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:20,830
You cannot take a shot nearly as well.

1520
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,930
[inaudible] you're more likely to die.

1521
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,793
What is gray Maynard?

1522
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,010
Uh,

1523
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,581
walk around.

1524
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:25,990
That to me tells me he's a big guy.

1525
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,130
Like one 90 or something.

1526
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:27,610
I don't,

1527
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,880
well I think he can probably get up to
one 90 of his eating whenever the fuck he

1528
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:32,410
wants and power lifting and shit.

1529
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:35,470
But he's most certainly
too big for one 55 I think.

1530
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,101
I mean,

1531
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:36,430
look,

1532
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,390
he's a beast,

1533
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:37,630
man.

1534
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,291
Don't get me wrong.

1535
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,480
If he catches you with,

1536
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,211
with a big shot,

1537
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:41,044
he'll put you away.

1538
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,960
But I think he's so thick that,

1539
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,291
you know,

1540
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:49,150
for him it might be better if you're like
lifted last and just got just a little

1541
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:50,950
bit more cardio into a system.

1542
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:52,300
And I know he's got good cardio,

1543
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:52,511
don't,

1544
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:53,171
don't get me wrong,

1545
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:56,620
but he doesn't have the same
cardio that a guy like Edgar does.

1546
00:40:56,621 --> 00:41:00,280
And I think one of the reasons for it
is a guy like Edgar has less body mass

1547
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,150
period.

1548
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,983
He has less,

1549
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:02,471
less,

1550
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:04,840
much small oxygen that has
to push through the muscles.

1551
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,070
And I think again,

1552
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:07,660
there's a point of diminishing returns.

1553
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,860
Edgar is obviously not
as strong as as gray.

1554
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:13,850
Maynard gray Maynard is
way stronger than him.

1555
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,520
The way scarier a punch or two,

1556
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:19,030
he can hurt you with like one of those
early punches that he hit and it with.

1557
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,110
Holy Shit Dude,

1558
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,900
his upper cut is nasty to Greg can punch,

1559
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,030
but I think that's a mechanical thing,

1560
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:25,271
man.

1561
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:27,760
I think he would be able to punch
like a motherfucker no matter what.

1562
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:31,390
I think he's just become a much better
boxer over the course of the time we've

1563
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:32,224
seen him in the UFC.

1564
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,980
I don't think him a

1565
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,410
little bit of mass would would hurt that.

1566
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,280
I really don't.

1567
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,173
I think he would.

1568
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,013
He would be,

1569
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,500
you know,

1570
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,950
I think he would benefit from just
having a little less mass on his body.

1571
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,510
But this is just me talking shit.

1572
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,490
If he knocked out Frankie
Edgar in the first round,

1573
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:46,970
I'd be saying,

1574
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,121
oh,

1575
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:49,510
he improved and he came back and he's,

1576
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:49,871
he's,

1577
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:50,111
you know,

1578
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:51,680
he's the best of the,

1579
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,940
the division now.

1580
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:56,990
And think about the thing about you UFC
now as these guys become better punchers

1581
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,760
those little gloves becomes such
a liability for any kind of error.

1582
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,460
You make any fucking mistake.

1583
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:05,121
And you go out,

1584
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:05,990
look at Eve Edwards,

1585
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,400
he was a great fighter.

1586
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,540
He was fighting really well.

1587
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,430
But one shot to the jaw with those,

1588
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,160
you're done the way eves went down.

1589
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,240
Like a guy who has been knocked
out before though there's an,

1590
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,380
I'm not saying that it wouldn't
have happened a long time.

1591
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:18,651
Yeah.

1592
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:21,080
I'm not saying that it
wouldn't have happened anyway
because it was an excellent

1593
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:21,740
shot.

1594
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:21,951
You know,

1595
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:23,000
it could have put them out anyway.

1596
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:23,660
But man,

1597
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,070
it was disturbing how we went out
because I really like Eve Edwards.

1598
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,470
He's a smart dude and he's a cool guy.

1599
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:32,570
And he said very skilled guy too.

1600
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,351
And you know,

1601
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,670
it's been around for a long time.

1602
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:34,880
You know it,

1603
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,750
you spin around.

1604
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,050
I watched him fight in the hook and shoot
days back when he fought Aaron Riley

1605
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:39,971
and we were in,

1606
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:43,130
we were in Pittsburgh together and
we were doing warrior and he was a,

1607
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:43,964
he was,

1608
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,510
it wasn't me and Nate Marquardt when we
were in my apartment and he was there,

1609
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:48,620
we were all a little drunk.

1610
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,750
And I start yapping off and I,

1611
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,410
and I'm like,

1612
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,071
and I'm like,

1613
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:52,341
you know,

1614
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:52,791
and I'm like,

1615
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,070
well I don't know why you guys
don't just fucking go for a double.

1616
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,120
I tag them that I'm just saying stupid
shit that he was trying to get his goat.

1617
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,820
I'm like,

1618
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,100
cause I know you're a boxer.

1619
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:00,531
I know.

1620
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:02,240
But then I was talking to us,

1621
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:02,760
so my,

1622
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,550
you want no part of my feet and my friend,

1623
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:05,384
I'm doing all this shit.

1624
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,141
He's like,

1625
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:06,730
he's trying to say,

1626
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,850
he's like really?

1627
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:08,141
And they,

1628
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:11,750
all of a sudden he grabs me and now he's
practicing moves on me as I'm trying to

1629
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:13,470
fucking stay alive and on,

1630
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,100
on the rug as he's
letting me choke them out.

1631
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:16,311
He's like,

1632
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:16,821
choke me and God,

1633
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:18,120
I'm not gonna fucking choke you gods.

1634
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:18,531
And he goes,

1635
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:19,041
could try,

1636
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:19,761
just try,

1637
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:20,594
come on try.

1638
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,261
Next thing I know,

1639
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:22,094
I'm like,

1640
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,540
I'm getting like twist it around.

1641
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:25,280
It's so fun in a role with guys like that.

1642
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,540
Just what they can do to you.

1643
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,860
It's just fucking ridiculous.

1644
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,240
So you just started training again though.

1645
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,201
How long?

1646
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:30,711
How many times?

1647
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:31,131
Just once.

1648
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:31,940
Just once.

1649
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,100
How many years off to Jeff years?

1650
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,330
We had a weird situation.

1651
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,140
How does Brian scared
the shit out of me when,

1652
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,211
when he told me this,

1653
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:40,100
this whole story is,

1654
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,120
it's very disturbing.

1655
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,720
Um,

1656
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,700
you had a real,

1657
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,640
real medical problem.

1658
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:43,800
You,

1659
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,150
I had,

1660
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,770
I had a concussion and um,

1661
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,220
I,

1662
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:51,220
my hands for like three months felt
like I was holding a hot snowball and it

1663
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,500
would come back all the time.

1664
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,920
And I found out that,

1665
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:56,161
that,

1666
00:43:56,161 --> 00:43:58,010
that is one of the case.

1667
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,300
That's one of the effects of a severe
concussion because I had a 40 minute fight

1668
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,980
with this guy named Pasqual,

1669
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:04,761
this French guy,

1670
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:05,181
and boom,

1671
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:05,421
boom.

1672
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:07,290
And Sini was watching and I,

1673
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:07,791
and I,

1674
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:10,130
it was at street sports
and I didn't want to lose,

1675
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:10,761
I was like,

1676
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:11,870
I'm not tapping in front of boom,

1677
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:12,230
boom,

1678
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,550
but how'd you get a concussion?

1679
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:14,690
I think I didn't even,

1680
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:14,901
you know,

1681
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:15,950
when you're wrestling that hard,

1682
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,090
you don't even realize you get,

1683
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:17,271
you know,

1684
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:18,380
you hit your head on the mat,

1685
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:19,041
you've fallen,

1686
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,050
you're doing all kinds
of crazy going crazy.

1687
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:25,190
I just hit my head on the
mountain a drilled recently.

1688
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:25,491
I was like,

1689
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:25,821
whoa.

1690
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:26,630
That was a hard one.

1691
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,110
Yeah.

1692
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,700
Head head injuries are no joke.

1693
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,181
But you know,

1694
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:29,901
I just,

1695
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:30,734
uh,

1696
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,200
uh,

1697
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,130
and I'm back though.

1698
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:32,880
I miss it.

1699
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,511
So when you,

1700
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:33,750
uh,

1701
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,460
you didn't know what the injury was,

1702
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:37,660
you couldn't pinpoint
that with brain tumor man?

1703
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:37,910
Nobody.

1704
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:38,191
I know,

1705
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:38,671
but I mean,

1706
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:38,901
when,

1707
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:40,440
what had happened when we were rolling,

1708
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,690
there's not one moment that
I don't remember any of it.

1709
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,240
And I've been so,

1710
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,230
you don't even know.

1711
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,601
I've been knocked out.

1712
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:48,270
I've been kicked in the head up and punt
I know wouldn't be being knocked out as

1713
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:48,450
you know.

1714
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,020
I know,

1715
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,680
but um,

1716
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,940
for this it was just,

1717
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:51,251
I got,

1718
00:44:51,251 --> 00:44:51,360
I,

1719
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,781
I guess,

1720
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:54,360
I think what happened was at one point I,

1721
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,141
I went,

1722
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:58,350
I think I was standing and I came back
and hit my head on the mat and we just

1723
00:44:58,351 --> 00:44:59,030
kept,

1724
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,730
you know,

1725
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,540
who knows,

1726
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,290
who knows.

1727
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,460
You don't think about
what you're fighting.

1728
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,740
Are we doing this?

1729
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:06,600
Why are we as a grown man
while you're having this?

1730
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:11,240
Because I still haven't let go
of the fact that I'm a pool is a

1731
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,760
lack of some mole man.

1732
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,320
Bill.

1733
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,153
Like I want to be,

1734
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:17,671
I want to,

1735
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:18,680
I wish I had some small,

1736
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,041
that's all I want.

1737
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:20,431
Just a little,

1738
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:21,470
give me a little fucking Simone.

1739
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,180
I just want the hair and the dark skin.

1740
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,080
No hair on my skin.

1741
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:25,860
Good.

1742
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,041
Look,

1743
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:28,140
I can wear turquoise and be a bad ass.

1744
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,580
Yeah.

1745
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,510
I can't wear jewelry.

1746
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,380
I looked like a fucking,

1747
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:34,770
I look like a something that I tell
in who wears turquoise or jade.

1748
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,341
Johnny Depp,

1749
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:37,050
he gets away with all
that shit were awesome.

1750
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:42,051
This something about when guys were like
large silver bracelets with big jade

1751
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:43,590
ovals inside of them.

1752
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:43,861
You're like,

1753
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:44,461
okay dude,

1754
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:44,851
what do you do?

1755
00:45:44,851 --> 00:45:45,930
You believe in channeling?

1756
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,111
Oh,

1757
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,640
is what I ask them like right away,

1758
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:48,570
what's going on with you man?

1759
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:49,980
He's spent some time with Sedona.

1760
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,001
Exactly.

1761
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,080
Do you know any healers?

1762
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,891
Exactly why?

1763
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:54,030
My ex wife's a healer.

1764
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,580
I was in,

1765
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,413
I went here,

1766
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,030
I went to John Varvatos,

1767
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:57,480
you know that,

1768
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,030
that we're where it costs $1
million for a pair of shoes.

1769
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,840
What does that,

1770
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,630
it's a really cool clothing company
that actually loved their clothes,

1771
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:04,920
actually look good in their clothes.

1772
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:05,191
You know,

1773
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:07,410
it makes them for guys who
were built exactly like me,

1774
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:09,330
but it's like really
nice cashmere sweater,

1775
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,410
shit you wear all the time.

1776
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:10,731
That,

1777
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:11,564
that it's like,

1778
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,920
because guys have two criteria
when they dress right.

1779
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,470
They don't want to look like a pussy
and they want to be comfortable.

1780
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,100
That's it.

1781
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,791
That's it for me.

1782
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:17,971
I don't,

1783
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:18,630
I'm not dressing,

1784
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,201
I'm not wearing,

1785
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:19,920
you know,

1786
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,161
but,

1787
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:20,700
um,

1788
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,290
so I get in there and that dude,

1789
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,153
that dude,

1790
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,260
this guy is like just very phase,

1791
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:25,651
just like,

1792
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:26,131
hi,

1793
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:26,964
how are you?

1794
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:27,360
I'm like,

1795
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:27,910
good.

1796
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,450
He's like,

1797
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:28,830
um,

1798
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,670
well let's start.

1799
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:29,971
I go,

1800
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:32,970
I'm doing a one hour special for
showtime and I'm bullshitting.

1801
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:33,271
I'm like,

1802
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:33,540
you know,

1803
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,373
I am by the way,

1804
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:34,861
but I go,

1805
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:35,611
I'm doing a special,

1806
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:36,061
and I go,

1807
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:36,570
um,

1808
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,051
and I want to,

1809
00:46:37,051 --> 00:46:37,771
I need somebody,

1810
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:39,030
I need to wear something on stage.

1811
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:39,864
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

1812
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,760
We have some great stuff
and he brings me over at,

1813
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:42,361
and before I know it,

1814
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:43,194
I'm wearing like,

1815
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,640
I got a vest on,

1816
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,270
I gotta,

1817
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,640
I got a fucking awesome fedora.

1818
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:48,631
I got this,

1819
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:49,464
he puts this,

1820
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,090
this unbelievable,

1821
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,800
this like chain around my,

1822
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,790
I look,

1823
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,020
I looked in the mirror and I was like,

1824
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:55,860
I'm sorry,

1825
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,570
but right now not to be a dick.

1826
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,820
I'm the coolest looking
motherfucker on the planet.

1827
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,451
This is,

1828
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:00,811
this is,

1829
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:01,500
I look them up.

1830
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,150
I was so impressed with how good I look.

1831
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:03,960
And I went,

1832
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,340
I've never worn jewelry.

1833
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,210
And he goes,

1834
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:06,421
oh,

1835
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:08,790
I mean if you don't wear jewelry
then all you're wearing his cloth.

1836
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:09,780
That's our rule here.

1837
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:10,441
I'm like,

1838
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:11,790
well you have to wear jewelry.

1839
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,780
Well it just looks,

1840
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,840
I was surprised but then right.

1841
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,610
But then I looked at him in the mirror
and I was looking at myself when I went

1842
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:18,900
like this and I said
right in front of my goal.

1843
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:19,891
Then again,

1844
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:21,650
I do punch people for looking like,

1845
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,613
you know,

1846
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:24,810
you see guys who are like,

1847
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:25,651
they walk in like,

1848
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:29,410
you know intelligentsia coffee where they
charge you $6 for a cup of coffee and

1849
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,910
their hair's just must,

1850
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:32,050
just the right way.

1851
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,610
They got a bracelet on this.

1852
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:34,060
Awesome.

1853
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,080
Don't hate the player Bro.

1854
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,700
I hate the game cause that shit works.

1855
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,140
It does.

1856
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,460
We pull up in a late model Maserati,

1857
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,490
you know you have a fine
[inaudible] that shit.

1858
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:42,941
Reading,

1859
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:43,211
reading,

1860
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:44,620
perhaps the Wall Street Journal.

1861
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:45,371
I want to keep up on.

1862
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:47,440
The market's going to get my coffee.

1863
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:48,274
Why me?

1864
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:48,610
Yeah,

1865
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:53,610
very successful financially when a man
typically not so much since the family

1866
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:55,211
died in the fire,

1867
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:57,130
I just can't find the right one.

1868
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,300
If family died in the fire,

1869
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:01,350
you don't introduce any tragedy until at
least the first couple of two or three

1870
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:01,670
dates.

1871
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,150
Got a biggest problem
when I'm not running,

1872
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,290
not running orphanages.

1873
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,370
I guess my biggest problem is what?

1874
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:07,900
The sweat to spend all my money on.

1875
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,490
You got to come off like a hippie pussy.

1876
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:09,881
They don't,

1877
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:10,590
you don't want that.

1878
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,550
Don't talk to the orphanage.

1879
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,220
She can.

1880
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,360
She can find that out.

1881
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,220
You're making grand plans.

1882
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,840
You can't keep banging her for long.

1883
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,610
You're at a one night pled.

1884
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,370
If you want to keep a girl in the game,

1885
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:22,690
you can't just make up orphanages.

1886
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,291
I do.

1887
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:23,620
I like,

1888
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,570
I like the Oscars like
the Wall Street Journal.

1889
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:26,404
That's good.

1890
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:26,681
Yeah.

1891
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:28,150
You've got to pretend like
you're a serious person.

1892
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:29,891
I'm a man.

1893
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:30,371
She's lost.

1894
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:31,870
She's got a pair on fucking rent,

1895
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:32,260
man.

1896
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:32,681
It's hard.

1897
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:33,514
It's hard out there.

1898
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,050
You know she's not in,

1899
00:48:35,051 --> 00:48:36,040
she doesn't feel like a woman,

1900
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,860
but yet she is who she is to just,

1901
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,460
I just manage my investments.

1902
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,010
I wear one of those book bags that
you could keep your dog in the back.

1903
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:45,930
Have you seen those things
with the little book bags?

1904
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,440
They met carrier dogs,

1905
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,550
animals in the back.

1906
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,630
Wouldn't you want it in the front?

1907
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:50,980
So you dog nose bleed.

1908
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,750
A little dogs are great chick magnets,

1909
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:53,770
puppies.

1910
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,060
But what's crazy about these book bags,

1911
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:57,730
it's like if you look at the
reviews like on Amazon or whatever,

1912
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,290
there's so many psychos that are like,

1913
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,940
I could fit all three cats.

1914
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,550
I love going to target
with my cats and my cat.

1915
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,310
The reviews are hilarious.

1916
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:11,110
Checking it on our podcast where somebody
was talking about walking their cat on

1917
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:11,944
a leash.

1918
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,671
Who was the,

1919
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:15,520
maybe there's a guy that walks
his cat on a leash by my house.

1920
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:16,863
Someone,

1921
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:17,620
God,

1922
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,070
I'm sorry.

1923
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:18,161
Oh,

1924
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:18,680
I'm sorry.

1925
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,300
Someone on,

1926
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:19,691
I believe,

1927
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:22,180
I thought it was on our podcast was
talking about walking in cat and all that.

1928
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,590
I might've said they had a
history teacher in college who uh,

1929
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,670
who told me that his buddies dog,

1930
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,130
his buddies lab had like
a litter of puppies.

1931
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,840
Like get the fuck can we
do with these puppies.

1932
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,690
There's like eight weeks they're weaned
and stuffs like nobody wanted puppies.

1933
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:35,260
He's like,

1934
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,621
fuck,

1935
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:37,150
and they're like board
and go on to the beach.

1936
00:49:37,151 --> 00:49:37,451
And I was like,

1937
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:37,870
I got to the,

1938
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:38,950
so let me just feed the dogs.

1939
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:39,700
And his buddy goes,

1940
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,533
hold on,

1941
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,643
I've got an idea.

1942
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:42,040
It's like,

1943
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,341
what do you mean?

1944
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:43,174
He goes,

1945
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,850
let's paint the puppies to
the peach and the guys like,

1946
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:46,960
what do you mean being the fucking pub is?

1947
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:47,290
He goes,

1948
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,123
don't worry about it.

1949
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:48,851
Next thing you know,

1950
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:52,750
they got a box of puppies and they
have a sign that says rent a puppy and

1951
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:53,830
they're renting puppies.

1952
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:54,371
You can go take,

1953
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:55,600
just take the puppy for an hour,

1954
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:56,503
leave a credit card,

1955
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,700
play with the puppy.

1956
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,730
Of course everybody
wanted to fucking puppet.

1957
00:49:59,731 --> 00:49:59,921
They're like,

1958
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:00,754
how much do I have the book?

1959
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,713
But my buddies,

1960
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,660
my history professor was like the girls,

1961
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,960
the girls that ended up that everybody
ended up hooking up with were just

1962
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:08,441
unbelievable.

1963
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:09,700
You just surrounded by girls,

1964
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:12,040
bring a bunch of puppies to
a fuck to the fucking beach.

1965
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,030
Forget your gym.

1966
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,430
You're working out for three
months trying to get your chest.

1967
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:15,851
All right,

1968
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:16,540
bullshit.

1969
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,321
You don't have to work out.

1970
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:18,670
Just show up with a bunch of puppies.

1971
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,990
Girls will flock to you.

1972
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:21,131
There you go,

1973
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:21,820
ladies and gentlemen.

1974
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,210
Thank you.

1975
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,043
Rent a puppy.

1976
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:23,890
Brian Collins,

1977
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,200
a genius when it comes
to picking up chicks,

1978
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:28,040
you don't really want to
up in the first place.

1979
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,823
That's the problem.

1980
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,320
Everybody is so starving to get laid.

1981
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,520
Men are so starving.

1982
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:38,060
The reason why there's so many bitches
pussies in the men department and this

1983
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:43,061
world today is because of the commodity
of pussy is so goddamn powerful and it's

1984
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:44,530
totally the,

1985
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,450
the percentage of the market
devoted to pussy is like,

1986
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,411
it's shit.

1987
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:53,180
It's got to be like 40 or 50% of the
market is based on pussy acquiring it.

1988
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:53,421
Right?

1989
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:54,250
And pressing it

1990
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:54,500
the,

1991
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:54,940
when I,

1992
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,860
when I think of the
conversations I've had,

1993
00:50:56,861 --> 00:51:01,840
the sincere conversations I've had with
girls just to get laid where my brow is

1994
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:02,220
not.

1995
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:02,920
And I'm like,

1996
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,580
really?

1997
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,450
That's amazing.

1998
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,000
Say more stuff that we do when,

1999
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,610
so tell me about this dream you had again.

2000
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:08,200
Ooh,

2001
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,033
wow.

2002
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,850
And women to get angry at
us for this insincerity.

2003
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:13,080
But this is what you have to understand.

2004
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:13,351
Okay,

2005
00:51:13,351 --> 00:51:15,270
we're junkies and you're the dealer.

2006
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,650
It's really that simple.

2007
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:20,700
The Universe is set up fucked up because
we have the same bodies that we had

2008
00:51:20,701 --> 00:51:23,580
back when infant mortality rates
were through the fucking roof.

2009
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,420
So you had the want to fuck all the
time so that you can have a reasonable

2010
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:30,330
amount of people so that the
human race could survive.

2011
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:30,841
You know,

2012
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:34,800
it was really cool common like back
in the day for people to have 10 kids,

2013
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:35,701
11 kids,

2014
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:36,534
12 kids,

2015
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:37,590
they just kids,

2016
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:38,281
we're fucking dying,

2017
00:51:38,281 --> 00:51:38,611
man.

2018
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:39,660
Kids didn't last.

2019
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,840
Then people got crazy diseases and it
would wipe out entire villages and if

2020
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,260
animals were eating
people on a regular basis,

2021
00:51:46,261 --> 00:51:46,800
you know,

2022
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,250
so we have that same body and
we want to fuck all the time.

2023
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,560
Our body has not reacted to the,

2024
00:51:52,561 --> 00:51:53,670
especially if you're athletic,

2025
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,100
it's one thing if you're
unhealthy and if you,

2026
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:00,120
if you're confined to a cubicle and
you know your body become sedentary,

2027
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:00,450
you,

2028
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,170
you'll lose a certain amount of that drive
as you get your 30s or forties but if

2029
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:05,010
you're athletic,

2030
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,440
if you're athletic person
and you have your personal,

2031
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:10,920
just the wheel hard engineered
to like the hunt of it,

2032
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,790
the same way,

2033
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:15,660
you can't roll a ball of yarn in
front of a kitten if a girl walks by,

2034
00:52:15,661 --> 00:52:17,100
it doesn't even matter
if you want to fuck her.

2035
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,220
If a girl walks by in high heels and a
bikini with a big ass and big floppy real

2036
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:25,380
tits and she's hot and she looks at you,

2037
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,161
you go,

2038
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:27,000
oh,

2039
00:52:27,001 --> 00:52:30,390
you just have to find a reason why
you had to get out of the room.

2040
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,213
Meanwhile,

2041
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:37,350
we are in queer becoming increasingly
automated and computerized.

2042
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,363
And so what happened?

2043
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,031
Worse than that,

2044
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:39,540
worse than that,

2045
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,370
we are because they're changing.

2046
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:46,470
Because the fact that pussy so powerful
men are doing a lot of shit that women

2047
00:52:46,471 --> 00:52:47,304
want them to,

2048
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:47,631
right?

2049
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,391
It's not normal.

2050
00:52:48,391 --> 00:52:51,240
But I would say that's
also because testosterone,

2051
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,830
muscle aggression,

2052
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,020
those things are becoming um,

2053
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,291
uh,

2054
00:52:55,291 --> 00:52:55,861
tools.

2055
00:52:55,861 --> 00:52:57,750
We no longer need to survive.

2056
00:52:57,751 --> 00:53:01,110
Think about what it was like just
to get by and feed your family.

2057
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,060
You had to work the
fucking land should split,

2058
00:53:03,061 --> 00:53:04,770
would bale hay catch around food,

2059
00:53:04,771 --> 00:53:05,251
all that shit.

2060
00:53:05,251 --> 00:53:06,084
That took a lot of weight.

2061
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,480
And now what happens is you go to the
supermarket and you swipe your credit

2062
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:09,721
card.

2063
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:10,170
Okay,

2064
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:10,490
so,

2065
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,190
so it,

2066
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:11,910
and I'm watching,

2067
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,620
I was watching two shows in particular.

2068
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:16,350
I watched Whitney and I
watched American horror story.

2069
00:53:16,351 --> 00:53:16,561
Okay.

2070
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:18,030
I like American horror
story stories by the way.

2071
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,983
It's scary,

2072
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,410
but it has it.

2073
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,300
He has an affair.

2074
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:21,560
Oh,

2075
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,500
crystal is my buddy.

2076
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,631
But he has it.

2077
00:53:23,631 --> 00:53:24,211
He has a,

2078
00:53:24,211 --> 00:53:24,790
um,

2079
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:28,050
a bad is fair on a Whitney.

2080
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:28,850
I haven't,

2081
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:29,220
I don't,

2082
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:29,461
I mean,

2083
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:30,920
I don't mind that it's a sitcoms,

2084
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:31,530
actually not,

2085
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:32,430
it's actually never lie to me.

2086
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,350
Like this actually has terrible,

2087
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,230
we go way back probably over a decade.

2088
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:38,850
This thing's going to be gone.

2089
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,820
I like the last topic,

2090
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:40,440
honestly.

2091
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,270
Like the laugh track.

2092
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,070
It's my favorite part.

2093
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:42,990
She's very pretty girl.

2094
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:48,390
I personally really like
Whitney as personally I,

2095
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:48,630
you know,

2096
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,111
I'm biased,

2097
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:51,540
but someone about those billboards
and made me feel like I was in a Coen

2098
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:52,374
brothers movie.

2099
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:53,101
I was like,

2100
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:53,940
I think this is it.

2101
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:56,760
I think this is the last piece of
evidence that life is a work of fiction.

2102
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:57,721
It's like,

2103
00:53:57,721 --> 00:53:59,630
what the fuck is happening?

2104
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,460
Just do not work for me anymore.

2105
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,353
I can not do

2106
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,100
that.

2107
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,780
But if you locked into a good one,

2108
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:07,620
if another Seinfeld,

2109
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,030
I mean modern family's funny.

2110
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,361
Yeah,

2111
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:10,830
I heard that's very typical.

2112
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:15,060
Sick on to backtrack studio audience
supposed to be pretty good at.

2113
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:15,880
I was doing really well.

2114
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,970
So that's what Chelsea's Chelsea handler.

2115
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,380
This Whitney's as well.

2116
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:19,800
She quit.

2117
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,161
Oh,

2118
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:20,731
that's right.

2119
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:21,180
Yeah.

2120
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,013
Oh yeah.

2121
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,750
It works her ass off.

2122
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,000
Man.

2123
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,300
That's crazy that she's got to show.

2124
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,041
I'm happy for it,

2125
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:26,191
man.

2126
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:26,680
I love her.

2127
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,820
I've known her forever and I knew her
back when she was doing open mics,

2128
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:30,091
you know,

2129
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:30,830
and she,

2130
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,340
she worked her ass off man.

2131
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,271
And you know what about,

2132
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,630
we know what I love about Whitney Whitney.

2133
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:39,180
He's always been fucking really
positive and really supportive.

2134
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:39,960
That's awesome.

2135
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,890
She's the girl.

2136
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,161
Well,

2137
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:41,911
I'd be on stage.

2138
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,610
She'd be out there laughing her ass off.

2139
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:43,741
Well,

2140
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:44,760
you don't get that everybody.

2141
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:45,301
How great.

2142
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:46,650
I was successful.

2143
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,110
You don't get that successful
without being positive.

2144
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:49,920
It's impossible.

2145
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,530
Positive person who worked
her ass off and guess what?

2146
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,790
I read the pilot of Whitney and
and I was laughing and I was like,

2147
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:57,510
she wrote it,

2148
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,080
she wrote it.

2149
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,560
Now you stopped blowing and stuff saying
it for a Sitcom and it might not be,

2150
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:02,394
you know,

2151
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,061
I'll just say it,

2152
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:03,894
I'm saying,

2153
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:04,590
but I'm proud of her.

2154
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:04,930
I said,

2155
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:05,260
thanks.

2156
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,260
I think said it comes to
the point I was making this,

2157
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:10,010
this is that w like Chris's character,

2158
00:55:10,011 --> 00:55:13,650
it looks at a girl and for
the whole episode she's
giving him a hard time and he

2159
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:15,600
feels guilty and he can't admit that.

2160
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:16,980
He was just looking at
for a girl and I was,

2161
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:17,930
I was saying it like that.

2162
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,420
I was like,

2163
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:18,840
look,

2164
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,070
the truth of the matter is we're fucking
genetically programmed to be that way

2165
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:26,970
until they have an honest conversation
about about what that struggle is for a

2166
00:55:26,971 --> 00:55:27,750
guy,

2167
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:31,650
then we're always going to die because
there's a struggle for a girl to,

2168
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:34,740
it's a respect issue and that's why I
don't think that people looking at other

2169
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:37,470
people while you're in a relationship
was cool while you're with someone,

2170
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,721
it's,

2171
00:55:37,721 --> 00:55:38,101
it's the,

2172
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,150
you know what you're doing.

2173
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:39,511
You know,

2174
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:39,721
when,

2175
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:40,021
when,

2176
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:40,621
when a girl,

2177
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:43,890
like I've seen girls do it to
dude's and it's very disturbing.

2178
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,820
It's happened.

2179
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:45,683
Especially,

2180
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,880
it happens around a lot around fighters.

2181
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:48,241
Like,

2182
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:49,230
I'm not talking about that.

2183
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:50,160
I'm just talking about when,

2184
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:51,150
when it does happen,

2185
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,590
instead of pretending it didn't,

2186
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:54,870
or instead of saying that
I don't feel that way,

2187
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:55,710
there is,

2188
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:56,790
there is a dialogue to be had,

2189
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,180
which is,

2190
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,600
which is,

2191
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,050
yeah.

2192
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:58,770
You know what,

2193
00:55:58,770 --> 00:55:59,341
that's,

2194
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:01,260
that's the way when you
get shit out in the open.

2195
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:01,631
Yeah.

2196
00:56:01,631 --> 00:56:01,890
Yeah.

2197
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:02,760
It takes the edge off.

2198
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:03,211
It does,

2199
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:04,900
but it's a disrespect
issue in the first place.

2200
00:56:04,901 --> 00:56:05,700
You shouldn't be doing it.

2201
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,280
You shouldn't be staring at some chicks
ass when you're in front of your wife.

2202
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,114
You know what the fuck it is.

2203
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,220
Just you know it's,

2204
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:11,280
it's easy to not do,

2205
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,850
you know it's easy to take it
in for a second goat chase.

2206
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:15,760
I surprised and then don't say it don't,

2207
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,190
but don't fucking stair blatantly at some
chick because you're just doing it to

2208
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:21,030
create conflict.

2209
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:23,760
You're doing it to make that girl feel
bad and we've all seen guys do that.

2210
00:56:23,761 --> 00:56:24,100
Sure.

2211
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,180
We've all seen guys do that.

2212
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,400
Or it might even actually say something,

2213
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,200
you know that makes everybody,

2214
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,380
I'm so lucky I get the elbow to me like,

2215
00:56:32,381 --> 00:56:32,861
Hey Brian,

2216
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:34,960
look at that girl's ass
like it's backwards for me.

2217
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,240
What else we want to see before.

2218
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,050
But again,

2219
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:38,530
no,

2220
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:39,363
his girl does.

2221
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,900
She does lesbian motion,

2222
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,410
like seating box.

2223
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,700
That's fantastic.

2224
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:47,320
Don't have kids where they
are but that's fantastic.

2225
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,390
Well you never know.

2226
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,980
You never know is riding on a grill.

2227
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:51,850
Give up on her pussy.

2228
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,110
They don't though.

2229
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,720
They just take a break and then when the
40 they kick you out of the house and

2230
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:56,890
move in with their horse trainer.

2231
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:01,720
Yeah.

2232
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,770
That's what's going to happen,

2233
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:03,260
Bro.

2234
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,900
They'll tell you a couple of years off,

2235
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,440
you'll have kids with them and then when
they're like 20 the kids or be like 20

2236
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,400
if you do it with your eyes wide open,

2237
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:13,091
it might be a risk,

2238
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:13,924
but fuck it.

2239
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,550
Take it anyway and she's like,

2240
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:17,260
got a pass and she's all fucked up,

2241
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:18,700
but you liked her dater.

2242
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:19,181
We'll see.

2243
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:20,050
You might lose your house,

2244
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:20,810
but fuck it.

2245
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:21,670
You'll get another house.

2246
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,860
I don't know if he necessarily
should be having children right now,

2247
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:24,694
but I see your point.

2248
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,370
There's no guarantee they'll guarantee,

2249
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:27,491
well,

2250
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:28,031
not only that,

2251
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:29,020
people do evolve.

2252
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:29,883
They do change.

2253
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:30,550
He,

2254
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:33,430
you can't judge everyone based
on their earliest fuck up.

2255
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:34,890
We'd all be losing disaster.

2256
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:35,893
Compassion.

2257
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:36,730
Yeah.

2258
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,900
There's some sort of a time in between
your fuck ups and who you are today that

2259
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:41,740
we have to accept.

2260
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:43,780
I don't know what that number is.

2261
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:44,620
What a time machine.

2262
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:49,240
I'd go back and just meet me when I was
23 and slap my face with an open hand.

2263
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,201
Why would you do that?

2264
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:51,034
But it's perfect.

2265
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,870
What'd you've gotten through
is absolutely perfect.

2266
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:54,420
You've gotten through
it all with humility.

2267
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:59,430
It everyone's afraid of making those big
colossal mistakes because they somehow

2268
00:57:59,431 --> 00:58:00,310
know that define you.

2269
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,480
I say they don't.

2270
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:02,800
I say you're not your past.

2271
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:06,880
I say your accumulation accumulation
of your experiences and what you've

2272
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:11,110
observed and learned in groove from
your experiences and because of that you

2273
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:11,220
know,

2274
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,610
or how you've grown from your experiences.

2275
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:13,480
Because of that,

2276
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,250
you're better because
of all your fuck ups.

2277
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:16,180
You should embrace them.

2278
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:16,900
If you,

2279
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,400
as long as you learn from your fuck ups,

2280
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:19,480
you're better because of them.

2281
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,160
I am unquestionably,

2282
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:24,160
I would not change a single thing
about anything I've ever done ever.

2283
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:24,760
I mean,

2284
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,980
I definitely feel bad for,

2285
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:30,010
I've ever hurt anyone's feelings
at any point in time in my life.

2286
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:30,910
That's the number one thing.

2287
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:31,930
If anything I ever regret,

2288
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:33,960
it's like maybe I shouldn't
have been so mean to that dude.

2289
00:58:33,961 --> 00:58:36,400
Or maybe I shouldn't have yelled
at this check or maybe I shouldn't.

2290
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,230
Maybe I should have like ate it before.

2291
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:40,980
I was just taking a look at
where they're coming from.

2292
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:41,680
Perspective.

2293
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,010
Yeah,

2294
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:42,240
yeah,

2295
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:42,400
yeah,

2296
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:42,581
yeah.

2297
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:43,121
Or you know,

2298
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:43,871
instead of just said,

2299
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:44,591
shut the fuck up.

2300
00:58:44,591 --> 00:58:45,081
I don't want to hear you.

2301
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:45,640
You know,

2302
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,900
those type of things but isn't,

2303
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:48,250
that isn't on what I chose to do.

2304
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:50,290
My regret is I didn't work
hard enough and some things,

2305
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:50,441
you know,

2306
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:50,970
really.

2307
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:51,270
Yeah.

2308
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,103
A little bit.

2309
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:52,850
Well,

2310
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:53,010
like,

2311
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:54,050
I know what I don't know.

2312
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:54,893
I don't know.

2313
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,760
I don't think there should be because
you've had a very enjoyable life and yet

2314
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:58,990
you have to realize is,

2315
00:58:58,991 --> 00:58:59,291
you know,

2316
00:58:59,291 --> 00:58:59,650
you,

2317
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,770
there's a certain amount of
whimsy to your personality and to,

2318
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,310
uh,

2319
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,720
to what makes you a fun guy.

2320
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:09,130
And part of what makes you a fun guy is
that you're never really truly satisfied

2321
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,750
with your current position in life.

2322
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:11,621
You know?

2323
00:59:11,621 --> 00:59:12,950
But that's an interesting point.

2324
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,050
But like you like that,

2325
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,670
and I've never had anybody
use the word whimsy.

2326
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,820
That's a ran of whimsy.

2327
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,380
I had a barrel chest.

2328
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:21,320
Oh,

2329
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,100
like think of yourself

2330
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:26,180
on top of a fucking all day
long boat with a broad sword.

2331
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,940
Whatever special is coming out in June.

2332
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,160
My one hour special on the cover
of the DVD as me hold my eye.

2333
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,400
They made my muscles really big.

2334
00:59:34,401 --> 00:59:35,540
I'm holding the Mike over man.

2335
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,770
And two girls are clutching.

2336
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,200
He's looking up at me and
I'm on a mountain top.

2337
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:40,090
You fucking eyes.

2338
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,060
That's what I want to be.

2339
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:44,180
And there's a horse rearing off in
the distance and a hawk in the air.

2340
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:44,691
I'm like,

2341
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:44,961
that's,

2342
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:45,794
that's what I want to be.

2343
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:46,850
Yes,

2344
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:47,391
it's true.

2345
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:48,450
I've always wanted to be,

2346
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:48,660
uh,

2347
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,250
you know,

2348
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,430
I've always wanted to be everybody.

2349
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:50,871
Everything.

2350
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:51,291
I'm not,

2351
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:51,681
but you know,

2352
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:52,161
in that sense,

2353
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:53,930
I kind of like who I am at the same time,

2354
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:55,923
that is who I am.

2355
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:56,731
But it is who you,

2356
00:59:56,731 --> 00:59:57,830
why it's not true though.

2357
00:59:57,831 --> 00:59:58,310
It's not,

2358
00:59:58,310 --> 00:59:59,600
it's not a real need.

2359
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,570
It's a whimsical fantastic is again,

2360
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,351
it is.

2361
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:03,891
If it is,

2362
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:04,081
it's,

2363
01:00:04,081 --> 01:00:05,290
it's like he's like,

2364
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,620
he's being silly about it all.

2365
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:08,480
If you really truly wanted it,

2366
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,261
you would do it.

2367
01:00:09,261 --> 01:00:12,320
It's like never take that motion
that you have as a father.

2368
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:13,920
I see the devotion that you have for,

2369
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,721
for your work.

2370
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:15,980
When you're actually
concentrating on something,

2371
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,450
when you actually want to do something,

2372
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:18,710
you're very focused on doing it.

2373
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:19,940
So it's kind of a fake.

2374
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:20,340
It is.

2375
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:25,340
It's almost an admiration for extreme
examples of certain individuals and how

2376
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:27,201
inspiring.

2377
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:28,490
Like you meet a guy like Alister overing.

2378
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,990
You don't necessarily
want to get that big,

2379
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:30,471
but God,

2380
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:31,520
Dan was inspiring.

2381
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:31,950
Oh,

2382
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:32,783
grab his fund.

2383
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:36,100
Giant Anaconda arm goes Gulf coast stuff.

2384
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,060
David off coast you,

2385
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,390
you're grabbing the guy's fucking arms.

2386
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:39,290
You don't even know the guy.

2387
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,550
You're grabbing his shoulders.

2388
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:40,921
I was Scott,

2389
01:00:40,921 --> 01:00:41,181
who's out,

2390
01:00:41,181 --> 01:00:41,601
who's grabbing,

2391
01:00:41,601 --> 01:00:43,280
I'm putting [inaudible] and I was like,

2392
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:43,480
wow.

2393
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,740
I was asking him about Brock Brock.

2394
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:46,790
I had to touch his body.

2395
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:47,240
I was like,

2396
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:47,391
well,

2397
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:49,130
look at this guy who
made these people don't,

2398
01:00:49,131 --> 01:00:49,371
you know,

2399
01:00:49,371 --> 01:00:49,731
that's a,

2400
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,260
it's an interesting fight thing else.

2401
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:52,640
There's one of the best
fighters in the world,

2402
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:55,180
but I think Brock is big as
fuck in a serious restaurant,

2403
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,420
had a lot of respect for Brock.

2404
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:56,811
He says,

2405
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:57,051
you know,

2406
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:58,490
he says he's not ready for the fight,

2407
01:00:58,491 --> 01:00:59,960
but I have a lot of respect for Brock.

2408
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:00,830
He's a great fighter,

2409
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:01,311
and I was like,

2410
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,550
whoa.

2411
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:02,540
He said that without cameras.

2412
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:05,360
It was just the fact that you can just
go up to a guy like that and grab them,

2413
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,420
shows you where you're coming from
because if you are weird in any way,

2414
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:09,530
you wouldn't be able to get that off.

2415
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,680
Now you can get that off because you're
trying to make it happen every 10

2416
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:12,890
minutes.

2417
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:13,101
I get,

2418
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:13,910
same thing with mayhem.

2419
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,590
I'm always like trying to
under hook them and he's like,

2420
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,160
you're crazy to think that you would ever
want to do anything different because

2421
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:20,640
whatever you've done has made you,

2422
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:21,563
you,

2423
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,051
I,

2424
01:01:22,051 --> 01:01:22,530
you know,

2425
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:22,861
I,

2426
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:25,190
I'm sorry for anybody that
ever hurt their feelings,

2427
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:27,140
but I'm so happy everything
turned out the way it,

2428
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:27,771
I guess you're right,

2429
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:27,951
man.

2430
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:28,611
I never thought of that,

2431
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:29,444
but I really liked that.

2432
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,200
As I was thinking,

2433
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:30,951
as you were talking,

2434
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:31,460
I went,

2435
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,110
I spent a lot of time
wishing I was somebody else.

2436
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:34,190
That's why I'm an actor.

2437
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:34,611
That's my,

2438
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:35,241
I'm a comic,

2439
01:01:35,241 --> 01:01:35,841
and by the way,

2440
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:36,770
that is who I am,

2441
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:37,310
isn't it?

2442
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:38,990
We don't want a guy who wishes he was,

2443
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,640
who spends a lot of time
wishing it was somebody else.

2444
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:41,660
That's my identity.

2445
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,820
Every guy wants an undefeated record.

2446
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,420
Okay,

2447
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,021
but I'm telling you,

2448
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:46,070
that shit ain't good for you.

2449
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,470
You have to understand
what it's like to lose.

2450
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:48,891
Of course,

2451
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:50,150
you have to understand failure.

2452
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:50,751
You have to,

2453
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:53,960
you have to be able to look back in
your past at a moment where you fuck

2454
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,970
something up and feel
uncomfortable about it,

2455
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:59,140
and that should provide you with a certain
amount of humility and they're just

2456
01:01:59,150 --> 01:01:59,980
trying to understand it.

2457
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,520
I think a man is,

2458
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,870
is the product of what,

2459
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,770
partially a large but
largely a product product of,

2460
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:12,080
of how of the actions he chose
to take as a response to failure.

2461
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,603
You know?

2462
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,181
Yeah,

2463
01:02:14,181 --> 01:02:14,571
for sure.

2464
01:02:14,571 --> 01:02:17,660
I don't know how you learn
anything other than the hard way.

2465
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:18,494
I don't,

2466
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:19,543
you don't,

2467
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,010
you don't

2468
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,440
really look,

2469
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:20,670
we're,

2470
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:21,270
we're,

2471
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,120
we're a strange animal that's
dealing with infinite variables.

2472
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:29,420
And the only way to truly find a
focused way through this path is to have

2473
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:35,241
accumulated a massive amount
of experiences and forged
positive information and

2474
01:02:36,271 --> 01:02:38,880
game plans from these experiences
and be able to move forward.

2475
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:42,090
You cannot know it all
right away from the get go.

2476
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,590
That's right.

2477
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,000
You know,

2478
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,350
just you,

2479
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:44,760
all you can do is control how you,

2480
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,680
how you respond to failure,

2481
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:48,600
what you choose to do differently,

2482
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:49,080
uh,

2483
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,550
readjusting your approach.

2484
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:51,720
And by the way,

2485
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:55,560
although the one thing for me
is I've learned just to enjoy,

2486
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,590
enjoy that and allow the frustration,

2487
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:58,930
uh,

2488
01:02:58,930 --> 01:02:59,100
what,

2489
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,110
how would you be able to make
fun of yourself when you fuck up?

2490
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:01,381
How many,

2491
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:03,150
so you guys can do that.

2492
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:04,080
So huge.

2493
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:04,741
There was a guy,

2494
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:05,410
do you remember?

2495
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,170
It's so big and you're great at it.

2496
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:07,361
There.

2497
01:03:07,361 --> 01:03:08,610
There was a guy recently,

2498
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,141
I say recently,

2499
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:10,500
it was in,

2500
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,610
within the last couple of years.

2501
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,900
It was back when,

2502
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:13,170
uh,

2503
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:14,270
legends was at the,

2504
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:18,190
the old bomb squad on Santa Monica
Boulevard where the two Jimmys to,

2505
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:18,660
yeah.

2506
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:18,931
Anyway,

2507
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:20,370
this guy picked up a hooker.

2508
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:21,530
I came back from Iraq,

2509
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:22,710
picked up a hooker.

2510
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,570
Turns out the hooker was a dude.

2511
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,300
The guy had sucked this deck for,

2512
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,180
I don't think I was a guy,

2513
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:27,940
shot him.

2514
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:28,440
Oh No.

2515
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,680
Dump the body in an alleyway
and an alleyway like a movie.

2516
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,410
So the cops apparently see
this guy dumped the body,

2517
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:35,430
the high speed,

2518
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:36,264
chase and sues.

2519
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,010
They chased them all the
way up to the desert,

2520
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,260
gets out of the car with
his gun suicide by cop.

2521
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,910
They shoot him dash wow.

2522
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,780
And all I'm thinking of
is this motherfucker,

2523
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,480
if he could just make fun of himself,

2524
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,320
would have the best story ever.

2525
01:03:47,321 --> 01:03:47,780
So true.

2526
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:51,810
The idea of the stubble and
this guy did it really quiet.

2527
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:52,644
Suddenly.

2528
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:54,703
You don't know that story?

2529
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:56,413
No.

2530
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,210
Interesting.

2531
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:57,660
Well,

2532
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,410
if I may,

2533
01:03:58,410 --> 01:03:58,930
if you play,

2534
01:03:58,930 --> 01:03:59,431
can't believe,

2535
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:00,420
I've never told you this story.

2536
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:01,780
I can't believe you haven't eaten it.

2537
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,610
And you might have,

2538
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,000
I met,

2539
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,620
I'm a club USA

2540
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,320
in New York City.

2541
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,243
How many years ago?

2542
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:07,741
Oh,

2543
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:08,220
I dunno.

2544
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,020
20.

2545
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:09,370
Whoa.

2546
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,203
I don't know.

2547
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:10,671
I'm,

2548
01:04:10,671 --> 01:04:11,090
I'm,

2549
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,240
I'm 63 now.

2550
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,300
You know,

2551
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,330
I've just had a lot of work done,

2552
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:15,961
but,

2553
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:16,740
um,

2554
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,130
uh,

2555
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:17,521
yeah,

2556
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:17,881
I'm,

2557
01:04:17,881 --> 01:04:19,560
I'm a Ahmed USA.

2558
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:21,330
I'm a young man and,

2559
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:21,650
uh,

2560
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,070
I'm dancing and,

2561
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,281
uh,

2562
01:04:23,281 --> 01:04:25,620
with my buddy and I meet this,

2563
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,240
I have a weakness for Latina girls,

2564
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:27,500
right?

2565
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,380
A little fatigue,

2566
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:29,010
curvy.

2567
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,190
I see this beautiful Latino girl.

2568
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:34,200
She's got this black pony tail.

2569
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,190
She's got,

2570
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:36,190
she's got that debt,

2571
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,200
caramel skin,

2572
01:04:37,201 --> 01:04:38,970
this cute little ass.

2573
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:39,960
They're just getting hard.

2574
01:04:39,961 --> 01:04:40,740
And I know,

2575
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,550
and this title,

2576
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:42,211
stop touching.

2577
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,044
She's dancing,

2578
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:44,550
she's dancing,

2579
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:45,600
she's dancing.

2580
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:46,434
She's,

2581
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:48,271
he said,

2582
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:48,900
stop,

2583
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,690
don't touch again.

2584
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:50,310
Sorry.

2585
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:55,310
She's dancing and she's dancing and she
locks eyes with me with the eyes of a

2586
01:04:55,321 --> 01:04:55,980
fighter.

2587
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:56,580
I mean,

2588
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,050
just looking at me and I'm like,

2589
01:04:58,051 --> 01:04:58,560
all right,

2590
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,120
well that's my wife.

2591
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,230
That's my wife right there.

2592
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:04,890
I start dancing with her and
we would dance one moment.

2593
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,560
She smells like fucking apricots.

2594
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:08,640
I don't remember what smells like,

2595
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:09,301
we're for the story.

2596
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:11,250
She smells like fucking apricots.

2597
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:12,503
And I'm just,

2598
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:12,730
um,

2599
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:13,171
does this,

2600
01:05:13,171 --> 01:05:13,500
uh,

2601
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,770
we started making out and I mean Bob
slapping on the dance floor and you know,

2602
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:18,130
sometimes

2603
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,963
when you're that attracted,

2604
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:20,230
everything else melts away.

2605
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,770
You just see that one person.

2606
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:24,850
I'm a little drunk and I'm
kissing her and romantic.

2607
01:05:24,851 --> 01:05:25,810
I mean deep.

2608
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:26,741
Oh God.

2609
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:28,630
So there are these booths,

2610
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:34,050
there were these peak booths at Club USA
where you could go in and there was a

2611
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:36,310
glass thing where other
people can watch you.

2612
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:41,340
So I take this girl into the Pete booths
and I didn't give a fuck as a glass so

2613
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:43,450
other people can watch and they
want to come into the booth.

2614
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:44,111
They can watch.

2615
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:47,140
But nobody took care of freaky 20.

2616
01:05:47,141 --> 01:05:47,321
No,

2617
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:47,831
23.

2618
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:48,491
I didn't do what the fuck.

2619
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:48,791
I was like,

2620
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:49,241
I'll take my,

2621
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:50,650
I'm fucking fucking right here.

2622
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,180
Condom shot off.

2623
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,460
So I'm literally like,

2624
01:05:54,461 --> 01:05:57,320
I'm going to fuck this girl right
here in this club and you know,

2625
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:58,330
so you cuff me,

2626
01:05:58,331 --> 01:05:59,081
go fuck yourself.

2627
01:05:59,081 --> 01:05:59,770
I was just in love.

2628
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:00,310
I'm going to get hurt.

2629
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:02,080
This is my girlfriend as well
as my girlfriend forever.

2630
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,900
So I'm kissing and I'm making out.

2631
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,560
And I'm feeling a bodies,

2632
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:06,821
guys,

2633
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:07,391
little dance.

2634
01:06:07,391 --> 01:06:07,631
I'm like,

2635
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,261
these are smaller.

2636
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:09,094
It doesn't matter.

2637
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,460
That waste so hard enough.

2638
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,310
The ask was on another level.

2639
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:12,910
I,

2640
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:13,220
yeah,

2641
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:18,220
she had a beautiful ass and
I reached down and I go for,

2642
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,890
well I grab a grab a branch,

2643
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:25,720
I grab a fucking branch branch
that had been talked under and she,

2644
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:30,721
he goes up and pulls my hand away and
I immediately realize that was a cop.

2645
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:35,890
I've been,

2646
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:37,750
I've been deep kissing,

2647
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:40,510
deep kissing for two hours,

2648
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,280
so I'm definitely a little gay.

2649
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:45,290
I mean deep kissing and
I just grabbed the cock.

2650
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:48,610
You ever thought or do you not
know about the cock and tight?

2651
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,361
How did I not know,

2652
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:50,194
dude?

2653
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,110
Because she was,

2654
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,920
she was taking hormones obviously.

2655
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:54,491
Secondly,

2656
01:06:54,491 --> 01:06:55,390
she was already like,

2657
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,380
had that skin,

2658
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,270
Latino or Filipino,

2659
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,150
whatever she was where she just
didn't have hair on her body.

2660
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:01,993
She was petite.

2661
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:02,561
He,

2662
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:06,110
I keep saying she's such
a girl and you know,

2663
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,944
but here's this here,

2664
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:07,271
ready,

2665
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:07,631
here's the,

2666
01:07:07,631 --> 01:07:08,680
here's why I'm a good guy.

2667
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:10,420
Here's why I'm a really fucking nice guy.

2668
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:11,740
Nope.

2669
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:11,940
I,

2670
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,360
I looked in her eyes.

2671
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,400
She was so hurt his eyes.

2672
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,420
He was so like,

2673
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:17,141
he was just like,

2674
01:07:17,141 --> 01:07:17,770
please,

2675
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:18,040
you know,

2676
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,530
let this big and I'm such a fucking shit.

2677
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,380
Oh,

2678
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,110
I felt so bad that I go,

2679
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:25,210
I go back in to kiss her,

2680
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:28,810
I kiss her him for
another like two seconds,

2681
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:29,201
three seconds.

2682
01:07:29,201 --> 01:07:30,070
When I go on the lips,

2683
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,120
of course food.

2684
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,700
You fuckers now listen.

2685
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,563
Oh,

2686
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:36,730
I'm not ready.

2687
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:37,031
Ready,

2688
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:37,301
ready?

2689
01:07:37,301 --> 01:07:37,661
I go,

2690
01:07:37,661 --> 01:07:38,231
I go like this.

2691
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:38,830
I go,

2692
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:39,280
oh.

2693
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:39,850
I go,

2694
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:40,780
oh fuck.

2695
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,250
I have an old sir.

2696
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,031
I have an ulcer in.

2697
01:07:43,031 --> 01:07:44,050
My stomach is killing me.

2698
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:44,710
And she goes,

2699
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:45,071
you do?

2700
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:45,550
I go,

2701
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:45,821
yes.

2702
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:46,031
She goes,

2703
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:46,811
do you have to go to the bathroom?

2704
01:07:46,811 --> 01:07:46,961
I go,

2705
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:47,101
no,

2706
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:47,161
no,

2707
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:47,231
no.

2708
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:47,860
I just have to.

2709
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,030
I have a very bad old sir.

2710
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:50,270
Sometimes it just keeps,

2711
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,970
so I want to protect her feelings.

2712
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,260
I felt bad him.

2713
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,280
His shit is and,

2714
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:58,720
and that's how I got out
and I left and I never,

2715
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,280
I did not come back to that quote.

2716
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:03,910
I can't believe you went
back in and you gotta be,

2717
01:08:03,911 --> 01:08:05,020
I didn't want to be rude.

2718
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:05,893
No,

2719
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:06,971
wait a minute.

2720
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:07,081
Wait,

2721
01:08:07,081 --> 01:08:07,150
a,

2722
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,680
I would have been the person,

2723
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:12,220
some person pretended to be a girl
and tricked you into kissing him.

2724
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:16,710
Never even told you something that for
a lot of guys would make them violence.

2725
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,710
I would've gave back for a lot of guys.

2726
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:19,400
I know,

2727
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,233
I know.

2728
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,790
I would've been mad if,

2729
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:22,010
if,

2730
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,720
if this person [inaudible] guys,

2731
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:24,554
it's an experience.

2732
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:26,921
It's an experience.

2733
01:08:26,921 --> 01:08:27,710
Well okay for you.

2734
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:30,830
But for a lot of guys it's an experience
that they don't want to have and

2735
01:08:30,831 --> 01:08:34,040
someone tricked them into doing it and
they could get violent and I don't,

2736
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:34,940
I don't justify it.

2737
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:37,040
But I'm saying a lot of guys
that would be the reaction.

2738
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,660
The fact that you felt bad.

2739
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:39,390
It's very strange.

2740
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:40,223
He went back.

2741
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,870
And then what are a poem?

2742
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:43,520
Did you ever the tongue after that?

2743
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:44,090
Uh,

2744
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:45,530
I don't believe a kissed with tongue,

2745
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,540
but if I tell the story again
I'll definitely use that.

2746
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,220
I know.

2747
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,760
Isn't it funny how Lego a
memory from that far back.

2748
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:57,050
It's almost bullshit anyway cause
it's so like fragmented and odd.

2749
01:08:57,051 --> 01:09:00,530
It's like I can recite the facts
of a lot of details of my life,

2750
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,120
but do it truly recall them.

2751
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,410
And if I didn't have a language,

2752
01:09:03,411 --> 01:09:04,670
they wouldn't even exist in my memory.

2753
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,040
But I'm tempted to tell you another story.

2754
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:07,491
I can do it.

2755
01:09:07,491 --> 01:09:07,801
Yes,

2756
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:08,180
yes,

2757
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,050
please do this.

2758
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,373
That was pulled.

2759
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,960
Did I tell you that Jimmy Burke story?

2760
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:12,853
Which one?

2761
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:13,340
No,

2762
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:14,420
a million Jimmy Burke stories.

2763
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,070
The one where where we were both
together with two girls on my bed.

2764
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,053
Yes,

2765
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:21,343
yes,

2766
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:22,483
yes.

2767
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:23,540
All right,

2768
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,050
that's good.

2769
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:24,710
Okay,

2770
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:26,270
so I had my best friend's thumb in my ass.

2771
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:26,690
All right.

2772
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:27,523
Uh,

2773
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,730
but that's a whole different story,

2774
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:29,750
Joe.

2775
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,340
What you put your thumb?

2776
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,293
No.

2777
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:34,851
Did I tell him?

2778
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:35,690
I'll say my thumb.

2779
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,500
Let's be clear about it because we
refer to each other as best friends.

2780
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:43,260
And I tell my thumb was never
anywhere near the punchline away,

2781
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:44,300
but there's a very,

2782
01:09:44,301 --> 01:09:45,440
very good excuse for it.

2783
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:48,763
Oh,

2784
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:49,010
well,

2785
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,090
should I tell him the podcast?

2786
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,470
It's a little late because
you already gave away.

2787
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:55,210
The punchline is if you can tell
the story somehow or another make it

2788
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:55,671
entertaining.

2789
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:56,840
Even though the punchline was already,

2790
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,670
I used to have ice date,

2791
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:02,930
I two girlfriends for a long time that
I had sex with 10 years after the fact.

2792
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:04,070
They were just my two girls.

2793
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:04,940
Loved them,

2794
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:05,660
loved them.

2795
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,130
I had texted those girls,

2796
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:07,610
I,

2797
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,920
you know that we dated in
college and then I dated them.

2798
01:10:09,921 --> 01:10:14,030
We want to add right after college
and and for the next 10 years,

2799
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,230
maybe longer.

2800
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:17,360
They were always a booty
call and I was kind of,

2801
01:10:17,361 --> 01:10:18,640
relationships are so strange,

2802
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:19,913
so weird.

2803
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:23,270
Even through their boyfriends to
girlfriends and we would always get crazy.

2804
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:23,780
Paul,

2805
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:24,321
how many,

2806
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:28,400
how many girls like that have a guy like
that somewhere in their life where they

2807
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:31,410
just have some arrangements
and they can always up places

2808
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:34,813
dirty.

2809
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,090
How can you tell?

2810
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:38,840
What do you cause they're there.

2811
01:10:38,841 --> 01:10:42,620
They talk about him a lot because he's
still in their life because he's still

2812
01:10:42,621 --> 01:10:45,050
really important to them
because they had a long time.

2813
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:46,063
I can always tell him,

2814
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:46,360
whoa,

2815
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,500
you're saying you could sniff
it if a girl's doing it to you?

2816
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,570
You can tell.

2817
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:49,920
I mean,

2818
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,271
I know.

2819
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:52,160
And it doesn't give you like
a nice green light though.

2820
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:53,571
You're like,

2821
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:54,021
okay,

2822
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:54,171
yeah,

2823
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:54,590
yeah,

2824
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:54,831
yeah.

2825
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:55,664
You should be friends.

2826
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,610
You're automatically goes to,

2827
01:10:57,611 --> 01:10:58,790
can assume that she's doing that.

2828
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:00,260
Just horr rampage

2829
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:03,750
was

2830
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,470
that with this one girl,

2831
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,633
right.

2832
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:08,960
Sorry about the training,

2833
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,290
but I was that with this one girl and she,

2834
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,133
um,

2835
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,010
hold on

2836
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,230
one second is it's getting hot in here.

2837
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,450
I'm going to continue the story.

2838
01:11:17,451 --> 01:11:18,284
I'm sorry for,

2839
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,230
I'll go slower Joe.

2840
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:21,320
So,

2841
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,350
so she um,

2842
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:23,700
she basically was,

2843
01:11:23,701 --> 01:11:24,530
uh,

2844
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:24,770
uh,

2845
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:25,200
she,

2846
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:25,560
she,

2847
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,393
she was the girl.

2848
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,260
Both of them were,

2849
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:27,660
you know,

2850
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,770
my girls for a long time.

2851
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:33,120
They are down at a restaurant in
New York City called [inaudible],

2852
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,070
which is a great restaurant by the way.

2853
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,890
And I get a call from one of them,

2854
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:39,360
which is essentially like,

2855
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,171
Hey Brian,

2856
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:42,330
it's such and such and such and such,

2857
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:45,210
and we're hanging out and we
really wish you were here.

2858
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,090
And we were talking about
you and we were talking,

2859
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:49,110
telling dirty stories,

2860
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:51,280
whatever they were saying and I,

2861
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,580
I couldn't call back fast and I was like,

2862
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:54,271
where are you?

2863
01:11:54,271 --> 01:11:55,740
Like where are the Il Buco I'm like,

2864
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,610
I'll be there.

2865
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:57,750
I'll be there now.

2866
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,660
I mean I was literally like 20 minutes
away and I got down there and five

2867
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:01,130
minutes I was,

2868
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:02,170
I was at his hand at the capitol.

2869
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,110
I drive faster drive factor.

2870
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,080
I get there.

2871
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:05,940
Long story short,

2872
01:12:05,941 --> 01:12:06,930
because I'm a team player,

2873
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:08,340
I call my best friend Jimmy Burke.

2874
01:12:08,341 --> 01:12:09,174
I saw Jimmy,

2875
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:09,871
that's it.

2876
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:10,621
I called Jimmy Burke.

2877
01:12:10,621 --> 01:12:11,250
I say,

2878
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,840
get down here.

2879
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:16,410
That by the way is always the code for
fuck and there's something about to go

2880
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:17,970
down and it always involves pussy.

2881
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,740
Get down here.

2882
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:20,071
He goes,

2883
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:21,150
be right there guy.

2884
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:24,180
He's there in two seconds
we'll drink and wine.

2885
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:26,730
I'm fucking getting them all
applied up talking about it.

2886
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,260
I could see the two of them,

2887
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,280
the two girls are,

2888
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:29,760
are,

2889
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,130
are all over each other and I'm like,

2890
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:32,551
Oh,

2891
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:36,180
you want to use me as a bridge to
have an experience with each other.

2892
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:36,991
How interesting.

2893
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:40,590
My two old girlfriends who subsequently
asked me to have children with them,

2894
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:41,250
by the way,

2895
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,330
just to use my sperm,

2896
01:12:42,331 --> 01:12:43,170
which was very flattering,

2897
01:12:43,171 --> 01:12:44,004
but I had to say no.

2898
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:45,000
But anyway,

2899
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,750
so,

2900
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:46,231
okay,

2901
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:48,150
so I'm like that Jimmy Burke goes,

2902
01:12:48,151 --> 01:12:48,900
hey guys,

2903
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:49,551
let's go back to my,

2904
01:12:49,551 --> 01:12:50,460
I call him the maestro.

2905
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:51,330
He goes,

2906
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,350
let's go back to my place.

2907
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,310
Let's go back to my place.

2908
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:54,270
I'll pull the fire,

2909
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,104
got some weed,

2910
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,760
I'll make some fucking
chocolate chip cookies.

2911
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:57,540
How's that sound?

2912
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,580
We'd fireplace chocolates or cookies.

2913
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:00,810
They're like,

2914
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:01,470
uh,

2915
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:02,100
yeah.

2916
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:02,581
Okay,

2917
01:13:02,581 --> 01:13:03,414
sounds good.

2918
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:04,380
We get to the place,

2919
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:09,390
he goes to the kitchen to get like to
start whipping up chocolate chip cookies.

2920
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,830
He's bringing out some weed.

2921
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,310
He goes to,

2922
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:12,690
cause we bring brings out we'd,

2923
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:13,460
it brings out a joint.

2924
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:14,101
By that time,

2925
01:13:14,101 --> 01:13:16,220
I'm already naked on the bed with the,

2926
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:16,771
with the girls.

2927
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:18,690
I'm already naked and he's like,

2928
01:13:18,691 --> 01:13:21,190
what the fuck is this is?

2929
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:24,560
And I'm like,

2930
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,810
oh my God,

2931
01:13:25,811 --> 01:13:28,180
you no longer working my balls.

2932
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:28,830
I'm like,

2933
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,470
oh my look at you.

2934
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:29,831
I'm like,

2935
01:13:29,831 --> 01:13:30,161
look at him.

2936
01:13:30,161 --> 01:13:30,460
I go to,

2937
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:31,110
I go to Jamaica.

2938
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,950
I'd rather be nowhere else
in the world right now,

2939
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:33,250
brother.

2940
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,380
This is the place to be.

2941
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,310
This is the greatest
experience of my life.

2942
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:38,830
Literally like I'm living a
porn right now and I love them.

2943
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:39,880
They're both my girls.

2944
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,460
So Jimmy's like,

2945
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:41,701
well,

2946
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:43,200
let me take my clothes off.

2947
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:44,051
He takes it.

2948
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:44,711
He looks like a red,

2949
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:45,341
bumpy pickled.

2950
01:13:45,341 --> 01:13:46,174
By the way,

2951
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:47,980
he's fucking hairless.

2952
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:49,540
Got a piece on him and I'm like,

2953
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:50,890
that's just not attractive to me,

2954
01:13:50,891 --> 01:13:51,724
but whatever.

2955
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,280
So he's trying to get
this girl's pants down.

2956
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:55,020
He's getting it.

2957
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:55,620
He's trying to,

2958
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,850
and he's got a tongue
literally that goes literally.

2959
01:13:57,851 --> 01:13:59,020
He could catch fucking flies.

2960
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,850
He's like one of those frogs.

2961
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:04,720
Like people don't know
what a entertaining dude,

2962
01:14:04,721 --> 01:14:05,440
this guy he's got.

2963
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:05,621
No,

2964
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:06,910
he's one of these guys.

2965
01:14:06,911 --> 01:14:09,010
Like there's certain people that it you,

2966
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:09,220
you,

2967
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,110
they go from cradle to the grave.

2968
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,130
They never become famous.

2969
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:13,600
And it's a national disaster.

2970
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,860
It's a tragedy we call national tragic,

2971
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:16,121
calm,

2972
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:16,990
the national treasure.

2973
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:17,830
He's the greatest.

2974
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,020
He's hilarious.

2975
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:19,841
He's incredible.

2976
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:22,580
He's a Joey Diaz type character
is one of those dudes.

2977
01:14:22,581 --> 01:14:24,430
It's just fucking hilarious.

2978
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:25,570
Like you're so happy.

2979
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:28,330
You know him cause you're always laugh
when you're around him because he,

2980
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:30,910
because he rides around
because it's Christmas time.

2981
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:31,301
He goes,

2982
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:31,901
come outside.

2983
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:32,141
I go,

2984
01:14:32,141 --> 01:14:37,141
well he's driving down fucking 57th street
with a cowboy hat on of down fest in

2985
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:40,120
the middle of winter
with no fucking pants on.

2986
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,133
And I hear him go,

2987
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:42,900
that goes with bowls of holiday.

2988
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:47,980
Oh and this woman goes and
screams because he's driving,

2989
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:52,530
standing up on the pedals and it's God
is going on 57th street in the middle of

2990
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:52,571
the,

2991
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:53,080
I used to,

2992
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:53,561
I was like,

2993
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:54,660
you're the craziest motherfucker.

2994
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:55,900
He was three blocks away from his house.

2995
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,220
There was a restaurant that we stopped.

2996
01:14:57,221 --> 01:14:58,180
I stopped going to,

2997
01:14:58,181 --> 01:15:01,450
I'm going to stop going to this restaurant
because the last time I went was with

2998
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:06,451
you and Jimmy and the fucking waiter
kept interrupting Jimmy Stories with some

2999
01:15:08,561 --> 01:15:13,561
newer bullshit plate that they're bringing
over with some fucking description of

3000
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:17,290
where the olives came from
and how the cheese is cured.

3001
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:22,410
And Jimmy's telling some crazy
fucking post nine 11 horror story.

3002
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,630
You know about like hearing the bodies
hit the ground and this motherfucker

3003
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,940
comes over with a plate of cheese.

3004
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,090
This cheese is a book too
from South America and it's,

3005
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:33,190
it's a type of cheat to
see what that Yak milking.

3006
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:34,870
Get the fuck out of here,

3007
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:35,500
man.

3008
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,660
Put the stuff down and
let's be done with this.

3009
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:39,010
There's nobody who tells
better stories neck.

3010
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,410
So entertaining.

3011
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:43,240
It was just bums me out.

3012
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:43,421
Well,

3013
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:43,630
the,

3014
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:45,160
that a guy like that sort of,

3015
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:45,820
well,

3016
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:46,421
you know what though?

3017
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:48,730
He always says that he goes
to life is my tapestry.

3018
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,410
He just has such a blast.

3019
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:54,160
He does always makes it a good time
no matter where that fucking guys,

3020
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:54,730
he's,

3021
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:55,090
he's,

3022
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:56,440
he's taken this girl's pants down.

3023
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,690
He's trying to get as
taste frog tongue in there.

3024
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,760
She's cheese trying to
go down the other girl.

3025
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:02,880
So she's more than the
other girl as I'll Megan.

3026
01:16:02,881 --> 01:16:03,340
Oh yeah,

3027
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:03,740
go on.

3028
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,000
I'm like,

3029
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,181
Oh,

3030
01:16:04,181 --> 01:16:05,180
is that my cock glare?

3031
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:05,820
As you know,

3032
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:06,490
I'm just a fucking,

3033
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:07,600
I'm sorry to be graphic,

3034
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:08,111
but the point is,

3035
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:10,240
it was just a fucking craziness.

3036
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:10,470
Okay.

3037
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:10,780
So,

3038
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:11,471
so he,

3039
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:13,060
he's trying to get a sense and she stops.

3040
01:16:13,061 --> 01:16:13,271
She goes,

3041
01:16:13,271 --> 01:16:13,690
wait,

3042
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:14,523
hold on.

3043
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,760
I don't like this.

3044
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:16,870
You guys need to,

3045
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,310
you guys need to get,

3046
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:19,360
do something together.

3047
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:19,550
I,

3048
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:20,171
I don't,

3049
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:21,850
I don't like to say I
look at Jim and we'd go,

3050
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:22,361
oh,

3051
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:23,290
we don't do that.

3052
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:24,243
I don't do that.

3053
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:24,551
See,

3054
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:27,490
I don't fuck around with guys
because it's not that I'm homophobic,

3055
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,260
just not attracted to guys.

3056
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,980
And I definitely have a hard on right now.

3057
01:16:30,981 --> 01:16:33,250
And so it was my buddy and there's
no fucking way that's bad enough.

3058
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:35,110
We're about two feet away from each other.

3059
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,490
I'm not doing anything with my buddy.

3060
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,560
And this is the girl that
Jimmy was trying to eat out,

3061
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:39,394
right?

3062
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,590
Like in Jimmy,

3063
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,673
right?

3064
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:42,280
No,

3065
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:42,881
she wanted to really,

3066
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:44,410
she was more into the girl she was into,

3067
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:45,244
you know,

3068
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:46,000
so,

3069
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,540
so,

3070
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:47,260
um,

3071
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:48,670
so she says,

3072
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,500
so she says to Jimmy,

3073
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:51,490
she goes,

3074
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:52,510
and Jimmy could give a fuck.

3075
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:52,781
He,

3076
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:53,290
he,

3077
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:54,130
he doesn't give a shit.

3078
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:55,090
He's down to go.

3079
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,260
And if he has to fuck me
in the ass to get to this,

3080
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:58,210
he's going to,

3081
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,140
he's like this.

3082
01:16:59,141 --> 01:17:01,000
I can see the look in his
eyes and he's fucking like,

3083
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,810
let's go.

3084
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:02,530
Let's go.

3085
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:03,610
What the fuck do you need me to do?

3086
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,870
I want you guys to make out
that we had done a play.

3087
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:07,890
We wrote a sketch where we,

3088
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,540
where we make guys,

3089
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:08,890
Joe.

3090
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,350
And I go,

3091
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,521
no,

3092
01:17:09,521 --> 01:17:09,581
no,

3093
01:17:09,581 --> 01:17:09,740
no.

3094
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:10,610
I don't make out with guys.

3095
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,450
It's disgusting.

3096
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:11,811
Can't do.

3097
01:17:11,811 --> 01:17:12,620
I can't do it.

3098
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,440
I had to do it.

3099
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,273
There was,

3100
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,230
you said you wrote a plate that you guys,

3101
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,470
I wrote this player.

3102
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:20,373
We can make out.

3103
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,090
I can't,

3104
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,300
I can't make out with doers.

3105
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:26,380
But I did write this play where
I make out with every letter.

3106
01:17:26,381 --> 01:17:28,270
And it's unfortunate that
it had to be that way.

3107
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,650
They had to make out with a guy.

3108
01:17:29,651 --> 01:17:30,484
But I mean that's just,

3109
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:33,160
that's what I wrote that I wrote.

3110
01:17:33,161 --> 01:17:34,080
It's called kissing a boy.

3111
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:34,923
But the point is this,

3112
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:35,940
um,

3113
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:36,290
skills,

3114
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:37,360
one of my dick hard.

3115
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,433
Why am I crying?

3116
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:41,890
Okay,

3117
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:42,290
let's call.

3118
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:43,450
Why am I crying your wife?

3119
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:44,351
Anyway,

3120

3126
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:49,540

3130
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:53,920
Oh Man.

3131
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,170
He goes,

3132
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,120

3133
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:55,960

3134
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:56,350

01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,111
And I'm like that.

3138
01:17:59,111 --> 01:18:00,880
So now I'm back to my girl,

3139
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:05,560

All of a sudden I feel like I'm not a,

3152
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:26,680

3153
01:18:26,681 --> 01:18:27,514

3154
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:28,150
So,

01:18:28,391 --> 01:18:29,560
So I'm like,

3157
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:30,460

3158
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:30,850

01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:33,610
I go,

3164
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:34,210
Oh,

3165
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:34,760
I guess,

3166
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:34,970
oh,

3167
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:35,740
you're a girl.

3168
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:36,251
I wouldn't go,

3169
01:18:36,251 --> 01:18:36,431

3170
01:18:36,431 --> 01:18:37,420

3171
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:37,630
I'm like,

3172
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:38,050
AH,

3173
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:38,883
fuck off.

3174
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,790
And I'm just so on.

3175
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,193
And then,

3176
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:43,250
and then I find,

3177
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,840
then I feel what feels like
a greyhound bus in my ass.

3178
01:18:46,841 --> 01:18:51,130
You understand a greyhound
bus in my ass to which I go,

3179
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:51,910
oh,

3180
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:52,301
like that.

3181
01:18:52,301 --> 01:18:53,350
Exactly what I went,

3182
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:54,520
oh like that.

3183
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,680
And I turn around like this.

3184
01:18:56,681 --> 01:18:57,461
I'm stuck.

3185
01:18:57,461 --> 01:18:57,761
I all,

3186
01:18:57,761 --> 01:18:59,350
I can do this on my back.

3187
01:18:59,351 --> 01:18:59,741
I turned,

3188
01:18:59,741 --> 01:19:00,100
I go,

3189
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:00,341
oh,

3190
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:01,000
I like that.

3191
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,280
And my buddy's got his thumb and my ass,

3192
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:04,001
and he goes like this.

3193
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:04,660
He goes,

3194
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,730
you fucking pussy.

3195
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:07,723
Oh,

3196
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,170
you know what had me style.

3197
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:11,070
Let me explain.

3198
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,000
Let me explain.

3199
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:12,930
Let me explain.

3200
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,130
Let me explain why and how she said

3201
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,053
the ham.

3202
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,380
I'm not going to do any more.

3203
01:19:18,381 --> 01:19:19,280
I will fuck you,

3204
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:21,320
but you have to stick
your finger in his ass.

3205
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:22,280
Do you don't have the balls.

3206
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:23,300
And Jimmy goes,

3207
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:24,290
what?

3208
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:24,650
I don't know.

3209
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:27,280
Fuck the fuck you shut the fuck.

3210
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:28,263
Yay.

3211
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,640
She give a shit.

3212
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:30,570
It's like,

3213
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,170
hey guys,

3214
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,190
I mean a little something here.

3215
01:19:32,191 --> 01:19:33,300
I understand wanting to get laid,

3216
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:34,860
but the stick your finger
in my fucking house.

3217
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,460
I go,

3218
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:36,780
I go,

3219
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:37,620
here's the problem.

3220
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,350
I got to tell them otherwise we're gay.

3221
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,650
I tell all your friends and
tell everyone in the world,

3222
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,850
I sold a half a million
people on the podcast.

3223
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:45,121
Hey,

3224
01:19:45,121 --> 01:19:45,571
you know what?

3225
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:46,140
There it is.

3226
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:46,570
I told,

3227
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:47,760
I was told my friends in New York,

3228
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:48,660
we told the story,

3229
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:49,500
they went like this,

3230
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:50,860
my buddy like German fat and they,

3231
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:51,081
they,

3232
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:51,301
they,

3233
01:19:51,301 --> 01:19:51,571
they,

3234
01:19:51,571 --> 01:19:52,800
they had their hands in their pocket.

3235
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:53,260
They are listening.

3236
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:54,093
They just went,

3237
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,223
fuck this.

3238
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:01,850
You wouldn't have talked to me
shaking their head in a bad mood.

3239
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,240
Can I fly Jimmy out here?

3240
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:05,500
Yeah.

3241
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,380
Has Him on the podcast?

3242
01:20:06,381 --> 01:20:06,830
Yes.

3243
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:07,260
Okay.

3244
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,160
The next time

3245
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,110
you do the podcast,

3246
01:20:09,111 --> 01:20:09,270
let's,

3247
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:11,070
let's schedule it in like
three or four weeks from now,

3248
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:12,480
somewhere before thanksgiving.

3249
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,160
You come out to do the podcast.

3250
01:20:14,161 --> 01:20:15,660
We'll fly Jimmy out from New York.

3251
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:16,450
If he can do it.

3252
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,040
Great idea.

3253
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,150
I'll put them up in a hotel.

3254
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:18,840
The whole deal.

3255
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,010
You stay out here for a few days.

3256
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:20,700
Okay,

3257
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,121
beautiful.

3258
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:21,750
Perfect.

3259
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,330
I remember the first time I met Calvin,

3260
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,520
I was sucking his Dick and uh,

3261
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:26,460
wait a minute.

3262
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,420
But you were wearing a blonde,

3263
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:27,650
right?

3264
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:28,060
Don't you think it,

3265
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,120
this shows me the gay enough

3266
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:31,261
wage.

3267
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:32,094
You want to,

3268
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:33,810
what made you want to take it deeper?

3269
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,440
It was these brain alpha
brain shit works son.

3270
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:38,251
Hey,

3271
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:38,560
I'm,

3272
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,460
have you heard about Trey Parker
and Matt Stone being investigated by

3273
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:43,260
Scientology for the last five years?

3274
01:20:43,261 --> 01:20:44,094
Have you heard of those?

3275
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:44,761
For what?

3276
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:44,911
No,

3277
01:20:44,911 --> 01:20:45,840
I haven't heard anything about it.

3278
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:46,020
Yeah.

3279
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:46,411
Well you know,

3280
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:50,440
they made fun of the whole
Tony I believe is crap.

3281
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:51,363
Yeah.

3282
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:54,810
Has a really big article about it.

3283
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,201
You know,

3284
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:56,370
and in some way,

3285
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,150
and this is,

3286
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:00,210
this is going to sound weird because
I'm a huge south park fan and I,

3287
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,740
I'm on their side 100% but there's
a thing about having a gang,

3288
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:06,300
like the Scientologists behind you.

3289
01:21:06,301 --> 01:21:08,280
The must be pretty fucking bad ass.

3290
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:08,821
I mean,

3291
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:09,271
you think about it.

3292
01:21:09,271 --> 01:21:09,421
Look,

3293
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:10,254
I don't,

3294
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:12,990
I don't buy into any ideology.

3295
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,660
I don't believe anything
that you can't show me.

3296
01:21:15,661 --> 01:21:20,661
I will entertain almost any offer
except religions made by science fiction

3297
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:21,211
authors.

3298
01:21:21,211 --> 01:21:21,990
There's a certain,

3299
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,270
and a certain point in
time I step away and I go,

3300
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:24,631
wait,

3301
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:24,781
wait,

3302
01:21:24,781 --> 01:21:25,021
wait,

3303
01:21:25,021 --> 01:21:25,590
what?

3304
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,120
But it has a,

3305
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,280
as a group and as a clan,

3306
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:30,930
let's call them a clan of people.

3307
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:31,710
Yeah.

3308
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:32,491
I respect that.

3309
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:33,990
They fucking stick together like that.

3310
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,710
People love being in solidarity
with other groups of people,

3311
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:39,340
whether it's occupied Wall Street,

3312
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,841
whether it's,

3313
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:40,051
you know,

3314
01:21:40,051 --> 01:21:40,884
I mean,

3315
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:44,550
I respect people don't
respect is when people use,

3316
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:45,210
um,

3317
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:45,510
what,

3318
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:47,850
when people use lawsuits,

3319
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:49,183
abuse,

3320
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,600
use litigious behavior to try it,

3321
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:52,830
intimidate and,

3322
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:53,371
and,

3323
01:21:53,371 --> 01:21:53,850
and

3324
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:56,540
scare people from taking
a look at them and that,

3325
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:57,374
that's what I am.

3326
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,353
I don't know.

3327
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,230
I don't know if that's what
they're doing inside and talk to,

3328
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:00,421
well,

3329
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:00,721
you know,

3330
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:01,140
look,

3331
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,930
Matt stone and Trey
Parker or they're too big.

3332
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:04,771
You know what?

3333
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:07,430
I know Scientology can shut down some,

3334
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:09,110
some shitty writers or some,

3335
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:13,200
some unknown people or some people that
haven't been established by the media,

3336
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:14,760
but those guys have a voice.

3337
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:15,930
You can't silence,

3338
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:18,570
then you're just not going
to make it way worse.

3339
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,220
You start picking on those guys,

3340
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:21,980
make it way worse.

3341
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:22,813
I know buddy.

3342
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:26,210
Fuck you up like they do like
what are they doing to treasure?

3343
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,330
Like what's this like?

3344
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,340
Are they just pointing
magnets towards their house?

3345
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:30,263
They're like,

3346
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,050
you know,

3347
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,380
I actually know a lot Scientologists

3348
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,950
cause I took class at the
Beverly Hills Play House and uh,

3349
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,031
for a while there,

3350
01:22:37,031 --> 01:22:39,910
there were a lot of them in it and some
of the teachers and one of the teachers

3351
01:22:39,911 --> 01:22:40,870
that I've said something really cool,

3352
01:22:40,871 --> 01:22:41,360
he goes,

3353
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,440
somebody asks me if I was assigned to us
and he had been for 23 years and he had

3354
01:22:44,441 --> 01:22:44,951
a good answer.

3355
01:22:44,951 --> 01:22:45,640
He said,

3356
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:49,510
have I taken classes there and gotten
immense benefit from some of them.

3357
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,470
Yes.

3358
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:53,170
Have I taken classes there
and got nothing out of them?

3359
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,273
Yes.

3360
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:54,521
He goes,

3361
01:22:54,521 --> 01:22:55,960
if that makes me a scientologist,

3362
01:22:56,050 --> 01:23:00,340
whatever has ra Elouan Hubbards dianetics
and different philosophies helped me a

3363
01:23:00,341 --> 01:23:02,110
great deal of my life in some ways.

3364
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:02,944
Yeah.

3365
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:04,240
And it was kind of a good answer.

3366
01:23:04,241 --> 01:23:04,541
He goes,

3367
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:05,290
it's a,

3368
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:06,280
that helps me a lot.

3369
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:09,670
But when he did in creating his own
religion is used a lot of excellent

3370
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:13,120
principals from a bunch of different
ideology takes responsibility for yourself

3371
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:14,140
as a lot of it is good.

3372
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:15,910
All the positive thinking and you know,

3373
01:23:15,911 --> 01:23:20,911
and there's something to be said for
his way of thinking about reprogramming

3374
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:24,040
your psyche and reprogramming
your reward system,

3375
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:28,090
attitude and belief and you know,

3376
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:28,331
and,

3377
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:32,260
and just just moving forward
in a positive direction.

3378
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:33,190
Very strong,

3379
01:23:33,191 --> 01:23:35,080
very important aspects of life.

3380
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:36,980
I think so 100% I think that w,

3381
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,420
you know,

3382
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:40,000
one of the things is just
looking at yourself and saying,

3383
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:40,241
okay,

3384
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:41,020
whatever happens,

3385
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,040
you can always make an excuse.

3386
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:42,671
Whatever happens,

3387
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:44,320
I'm responsible for
every condition on him.

3388
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,750
It's a better way to go through
your life even if you're not.

3389
01:23:46,751 --> 01:23:47,171
So what?

3390
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:47,670
It doesn't matter.

3391
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:48,910
Just move on to the carrots,

3392
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:50,190
move off to get my shit.

3393
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:50,460
What,

3394
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:51,310
what the excuse is.

3395
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:52,690
You can have the best cause Houston world.

3396
01:23:52,691 --> 01:23:53,800
The problem is the world goes,

3397
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:54,280
I know.

3398
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:54,940
That's terrible.

3399
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:55,773
Next,

3400
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,380
next.

3401
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:56,531
Well,

3402
01:23:56,531 --> 01:24:00,190
some people just need an
ideology and that ideology works,

3403
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:00,821
you know?

3404
01:24:00,821 --> 01:24:01,201
And I,

3405
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:03,280
I like I had a next door
neighbor who was a scientologist.

3406
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:04,450
It was a nice fucking guy.

3407
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:05,800
They were really nice family.

3408
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,810
I always enjoy talking to them.

3409
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:08,680
I know a lot of them,

3410
01:24:08,681 --> 01:24:09,580
I've met a lot of them and,

3411
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,320
and uh,

3412
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,500
I've never had a problem with them.

3413
01:24:11,650 --> 01:24:16,650
But I absolutely agree with you when
it comes to them lawsuits and people

3414
01:24:16,991 --> 01:24:20,170
critiquing them or criticizing
them and them going after people,

3415
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:20,680
you know,

3416
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,970
I gotta let that shit go,

3417
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:22,570
man.

3418
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,410
That's probably,

3419
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:24,420
you know,

3420
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,200
they're bullies.

3421
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,220
They're the powerful
few people in power who,

3422
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:28,650
who,

3423
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:30,670
who are doing these kinds of things.

3424
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,890
It doesn't necessarily
mean that everybody,

3425
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:33,160
you know,

3426
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:33,611
it's not,

3427
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:34,870
it's not an indictment by the,

3428
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,141
you know,

3429
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:35,710
by a few.

3430
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:35,980
Right,

3431
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:36,760
right.

3432
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:37,241
Well,

3433
01:24:37,241 --> 01:24:37,541
you know,

3434
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:38,080
I don't know.

3435
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,913
I don't know.

3436
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:40,030
I don't know the real numbers,

3437
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:42,220
but it is a fascinating thing to me that,

3438
01:24:42,221 --> 01:24:44,230
that it is possible to
do something like that.

3439
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,540
But it also is very Coen brothers ask,

3440
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:46,871
you know,

3441
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:51,871
it's also very much like another piece
of evidence appointment to the idea that

3442
01:24:51,881 --> 01:24:54,130
the entire world that we
live in is a work of fiction.

3443
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,211
It's not real.

3444
01:24:55,211 --> 01:24:57,040
It's a part of my imagination
because otherwise,

3445
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:58,450
why would this really exist?

3446
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:00,760
Why would actress be so vapid?

3447
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:00,941
I mean,

3448
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:02,360
if you ever met actors when you,

3449
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:04,370
you're on the senior working with
them and you'd go into and go,

3450
01:25:04,371 --> 01:25:05,470
this isn't even real.

3451
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:06,363
There's no you guys,

3452
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:07,810
you went too far.

3453
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,220
This is not believable.

3454
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,300
What Daniel Day Lewis,

3455
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:12,070
there's a great interview where he said,

3456
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,460
Dan Daly was said the funniest thing
because I think he's an incredible actor,

3457
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:15,670
right?

3458
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,560
So I started like kind of like
researching them and stuff.

3459
01:25:17,561 --> 01:25:18,170
I just,

3460
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:18,680
he's amazing.

3461
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,690
We've talked about on the podcast,

3462
01:25:19,691 --> 01:25:21,550
so a thousand times he said,

3463
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:21,701
you know,

3464
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:23,200
you guys want to know about my process.

3465
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:23,860
He said,

3466
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:24,340
you know,

3467
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,190
I stuck flowers at my jacket,

3468
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,043
did cartwheels.

3469
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,060
It wouldn't really matter.

3470
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,260
The bottom line is this.

3471
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,620
I sit around all day wearing
somebody else's clothing,

3472
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,330
having somebody else's thoughts,

3473
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:39,360
saying somebody else's words and trying
to believe all of it basically because I

3474
01:25:39,491 --> 01:25:40,780
am at heart,

3475
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:42,850
a boring Middleclass Englishman,

3476
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:45,830
I think he said because I'm ashamed of
being basically a boring middle classes.

3477
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,770
It was a great answer because he just,

3478
01:25:47,771 --> 01:25:47,920
he,

3479
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,990
he looked at the absurdity Christian Bale.

3480
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:50,321
They were like,

3481
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:51,670
why do you lose weight so much since then?

3482
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:52,040
He goes,

3483
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:56,200
because I'm a man and I put makeup on
and I make believe for a living and I got

3484
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:56,890
to make it.

3485
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:58,540
I gotta make it feel like real work,

3486
01:25:58,590 --> 01:25:58,870
you know?

3487
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:02,530
I got it so I can close to
dying when he did the machine.

3488
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,160
That's ridiculous.

3489
01:26:04,161 --> 01:26:05,780
I've never seen a
transformation like that.

3490
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:06,261
You know,

3491
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,310
a lot of people like were,

3492
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:09,530
I remember back in the day when
people were first starting to do that,

3493
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,620
Robert Deniro was one of the first guys
to put on weight for a movie for raging

3494
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:13,700
bull and I was like,

3495
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:14,061
wow,

3496
01:26:14,061 --> 01:26:15,440
he really got fat for that movie.

3497
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:16,101
Like that's crazy.

3498
01:26:16,101 --> 01:26:17,510
And I read about his diet.

3499
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:19,280
It was just eating like a regular Italian,

3500
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:21,760
just fucking meatballs and Pasta all day.

3501
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:22,760
And um,

3502
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,061
you know,

3503
01:26:23,061 --> 01:26:23,811
and everybody was like,

3504
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:24,051
wow,

3505
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:24,801
that's amazing.

3506
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:27,410
But with Christian Bale did
was a thousand times harder.

3507
01:26:27,411 --> 01:26:30,470
He literally almost
starved himself to death.

3508
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:30,921
Credible.

3509
01:26:30,921 --> 01:26:32,720
That guy is fucking incredible.

3510
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:32,821
Yeah.

3511
01:26:32,821 --> 01:26:33,111
It's like,

3512
01:26:33,111 --> 01:26:36,710
you remember that that below out when
he was on were they kept playing in our

3513
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:38,630
radio stations where he was
yelling at some guy on the set.

3514
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,520
It's cause it kind of
sets a fucking idiot.

3515
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:41,563
He's right.

3516
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:46,750
If you're operating on that level of
frequency where you need to really believe

3517
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:50,330
that you're in this scene and
some asshole keeps walking around,

3518
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:51,550
tweaking things in,

3519
01:26:51,551 --> 01:26:51,800
in,

3520
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,281
in your,

3521
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:53,510
in your line of sight.

3522
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:54,860
But that's not supposed to be there.

3523
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:55,783
It's maddening.

3524
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,390
And everybody knows that one pastory
motherfucker that you can work with the

3525
01:26:59,391 --> 01:27:02,630
whole fucking anywhere his
face for the rest of his life.

3526
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,000
But it's hilarious that
they released that.

3527
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,251
They're,

3528
01:27:05,251 --> 01:27:06,230
they're released that and look,

3529
01:27:06,231 --> 01:27:06,441
yeah,

3530
01:27:06,441 --> 01:27:07,340
he was going crazy.

3531
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:09,200
But one of the things what he was saying,

3532
01:27:09,201 --> 01:27:09,531
it's you,

3533
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:11,150
you're not fucking professional.

3534
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:12,110
He goes,

3535
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:13,070
you're a nice guy.

3536
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:13,881
You're a nice guy,

3537
01:27:13,881 --> 01:27:15,380
but you're not fucking professional man.

3538
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:16,010
He's right.

3539
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:16,251
You know,

3540
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:16,441
you,

3541
01:27:16,441 --> 01:27:16,731
you,

3542
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,650
you reach a certain level of intensity,

3543
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:19,550
emotional intensity.

3544
01:27:19,551 --> 01:27:20,990
When you do a role like that.

3545
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:21,711
Again,

3546
01:27:21,711 --> 01:27:23,330
I'm just totally talking out of my ass.

3547
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:24,770
I was just as a zookeeper,

3548
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,950
I was at a child or your various,

3549
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:28,581
my big,

3550
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:29,414
my big park.

3551
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,440
But there's a certain intensity
that you reach when you're,

3552
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:36,260
you're putting yourself into a part
like that and you see some guy walking

3553
01:27:36,261 --> 01:27:37,100
around in the background,

3554
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,500
tweaking the fucking lights
right in front of your eyes.

3555
01:27:39,501 --> 01:27:39,681
Like,

3556
01:27:39,681 --> 01:27:40,514
come on dude.

3557
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:41,383
Really?

3558
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,920
I could the fuck are you doing Bob?

3559
01:27:42,921 --> 01:27:43,820
Put the lights down.

3560
01:27:43,821 --> 01:27:45,040
Get the fuck Outta here.

3561
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,160
Yeah.

3562
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,360
If you're trying to be great,

3563
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:50,810
what he's trying to do is that
somebody is fucking buzzing around.

3564
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:52,100
You can understand it,

3565
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:54,080
but we allow them to
do like a Batman movie.

3566
01:27:54,081 --> 01:27:56,810
You're allowed to do those piece of shit
when it was needed to make that money.

3567
01:27:56,811 --> 01:27:57,560
Son,

3568
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,530
I'm going to come back and
do something else crazy.

3569
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,250
He's fucking amazing.

3570
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,490
So this is only a few of those guys.

3571
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:01,761
You know,

3572
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:04,580
there's a few of those Russell Crowe's
out there that really become a different

3573
01:28:04,581 --> 01:28:05,140
guy.

3574
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,740
You're like Russell Crowe and the insider,

3575
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:10,670
so one of my favorite movies because
movie scary fucking movie man.

3576
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:13,640
When you find out how much
of it is based on reality,

3577
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,720
how terrifying it is,

3578
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:16,460
how much power that
tobacco companies have,

3579
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:18,680
and that's sort of like what's going on.

3580
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,230
My thoughts about this whole
occupy Wall Street thing,

3581
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:25,310
when you look at banks and hedge fund
companies and all these is this corruption

3582
01:28:25,311 --> 01:28:27,530
and the financial situation
that we have right now.

3583
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,640
You look at it and you're like,

3584
01:28:28,641 --> 01:28:28,941
man,

3585
01:28:28,941 --> 01:28:32,450
these people have been getting
away with so much for so long.

3586
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:35,480
It's like telling them that
everything has to be fair now.

3587
01:28:35,481 --> 01:28:36,200
They're like,

3588
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,310
fuck you.

3589
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:38,840
Like I made him get into this.

3590
01:28:38,841 --> 01:28:39,470
To be fair,

3591
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:44,030
I got into this because I met my friend
Tim at school and he was two years ahead

3592
01:28:44,031 --> 01:28:47,780
of me and he brought me out in a limo
with coke and hookers and they said,

3593
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:48,291
listen bro,

3594
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:50,240
we're trading stocks
were shortened things.

3595
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:51,380
We're making millions.

3596
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,630
We got this fucking town
wired and you're like,

3597
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:53,990
mmm,

3598
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,823
I want in.

3599
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:56,420
And then you'll all get
together in the 80s,

3600
01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:59,450
Gordon Gekko style and start
fucking raping the financial system.

3601
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:01,280
That's why the day in the first place,

3602
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:02,280
they're there to make

3603
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,340
as fuck tons of money through
every possible loophole.

3604
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,710
Did you read about one of the CEO's wives,

3605
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:08,281
um,

3606
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:08,701
who uh,

3607
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:13,701
got some of the government bailout
money to start a new business like $250

3608
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:15,490
million in loans from some fucking guy.

3609
01:29:15,491 --> 01:29:16,740
He's got like billions of dollars.

3610
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:17,850
It's amazing.

3611
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:18,900
His wife,

3612
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:22,830
he had his wife do a twosome snazzy
loophole that they engineered into the

3613
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:23,221
system.

3614
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:24,650
You start to feel invincible on it.

3615
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:25,513
So amazing.

3616
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:25,910
Well,

3617
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:26,191
look,

3618
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:26,971
when the old,

3619
01:29:26,971 --> 01:29:27,480
the president,

3620
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:27,901
the United States,

3621
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:29,850
when you know how much they own shit,

3622
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:31,680
when the president of
the United States says,

3623
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:32,970
ladies and gentlemen,

3624
01:29:32,971 --> 01:29:35,310
poor suffering people of our country,

3625
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:40,550
I am going to take billions of dollars
of your tax money and I'm going to give

3626
01:29:41,221 --> 01:29:44,040
it to these cunts that ruined these banks.

3627
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,500
And I'm real sorry about this.

3628
01:29:46,501 --> 01:29:50,340
But they get bonuses and their bonuses
are going to be roughly half of what

3629
01:29:50,341 --> 01:29:52,020
you're going to make in your entire life.

3630
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:54,180
It's going to be a half a
million dollars is what?

3631
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:55,320
We're going to put a cap on it.

3632
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,000
That's the cap he was trying to put on it.

3633
01:29:57,170 --> 01:30:00,540
It was like when to put a half a million
dollar cap that's there's no buddy.

3634
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:01,410
Your bank is done.

3635
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,360
You can't give a bonus
if there's no money.

3636
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:04,710
You don't have a bank anymore.

3637
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:08,370
The reason why you have a big is cause
you took our fucking taxes and you throw

3638
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:11,520
it back into your system and
now everything's spinning
and you want to shit out.

3639
01:30:11,521 --> 01:30:12,354
Bonuses.

3640
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:17,100
What kind of contract do you have where
you have a bonus when the bank breaks,

3641
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:17,550
right.

3642
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:18,870
It literally breaks.

3643
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:19,560
I will say it,

3644
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,580
but how old?

3645
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:21,340
I mean what,

3646
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:23,160
what message are they telling us?

3647
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:27,260
When the president tells all the
poor people of this country with the

3648
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,920
middleclass is falling apart.

3649
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:31,080
Poverty is an all time level high.

3650
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:34,110
Exactly four 47% of all of Detroit.

3651
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:34,680
You're literate.

3652
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:35,820
I mean literally the infrastructure,

3653
01:30:35,821 --> 01:30:37,230
everything's falling apart and he's like,

3654
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,420
I'm going to limit it to
a half a million dollars.

3655
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:39,600
Like,

3656
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,500
but first of all,

3657
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:40,801
first of all,

3658
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:41,180
you can't,

3659
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:41,820
you can't,

3660
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:42,570
you can't eliminate it.

3661
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:42,831
Thing on.

3662
01:30:42,831 --> 01:30:43,740
The other thing is that,

3663
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:44,683
the other thing is that,

3664
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:45,230
um,

3665
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:46,370
I think at the end of the day,

3666
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:46,611
the,

3667
01:30:46,611 --> 01:30:47,150
the,

3668
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:47,983
the um,

3669
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,740
I went to occupy Los Angeles last night.

3670
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,270
What do you mean you can't limit anything?

3671
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:51,731
Well,

3672
01:30:51,731 --> 01:30:52,000
well,

3673
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:52,750
w w well,

3674
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,350
the,

3675
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,920
when you,

3676
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:54,753
when you,

3677
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:55,451
what,

3678
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:58,480
what banks will say is
when you give that money,

3679
01:30:58,481 --> 01:31:01,450
when you give that tarp money to a bank
and they're going to use it for various

3680
01:31:01,451 --> 01:31:02,830
things there,

3681
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:05,290
they're using it to
operate their business,

3682
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:06,640
to keep their business afloat.

3683
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:07,210
And the PR,

3684
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:10,390
the biggest problem was that these banks
came to that to someone like Obama.

3685
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:10,690
Well,

3686
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:11,950
actually not to Obama and Bush,

3687
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:14,050
he's the fucking president.

3688
01:31:14,051 --> 01:31:15,220
He goes to them and says,

3689
01:31:15,221 --> 01:31:15,790
listen,

3690
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:16,601
no bonuses.

3691
01:31:16,601 --> 01:31:18,280
You fuck you still wait.

3692
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:19,230
He's not allowed to

3693
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:21,221
get away with it.

3694
01:31:21,221 --> 01:31:21,620
In other words,

3695
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,900
[inaudible] who is the fucking president?

3696
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:24,490
Know what I'm saying?

3697
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:25,330
Was running shit.

3698
01:31:25,331 --> 01:31:26,460
That's tells you the banks.

3699
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:27,130
Yeah.

3700
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:30,430
The Bay from the banks were too big to
fail and that's the biggest problem.

3701
01:31:30,431 --> 01:31:34,350
When you have a bag that's a
philosophy esophageal it maybe,

3702
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:35,231
but when you have a bank,

3703
01:31:35,231 --> 01:31:35,651
when you have,

3704
01:31:35,651 --> 01:31:39,100
when you have a situation where most
economists are saying that the president

3705
01:31:39,101 --> 01:31:39,790
look,

3706
01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:43,870
the central nervous system of this
economy is going to collapse if you don't,

3707
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,190
I'm not saying this is good.

3708
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,900
I understand the arguments for the bail.

3709
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:48,130
His problem is that these fucking,

3710
01:31:48,131 --> 01:31:51,490
these banks weren't dealing
with their own money there.

3711
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:51,870
We did.

3712
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:53,920
They were taking risks with your money.

3713
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:56,020
That is a huge problem
and it is a huge problem,

3714
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,160
but that's not my point.

3715
01:31:57,161 --> 01:32:00,050
My point is that you have
these giant bail them out

3716
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,120
and they were still giving them bonuses.

3717
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:01,983
Exactly.

3718
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:03,310
Doling out bonuses,

3719
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,800
how blatant it is.

3720
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:07,090
The way they justified it was this.

3721
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:07,451
They said,

3722
01:32:07,451 --> 01:32:10,570
if we don't give bonuses and those guys
will go to other corporations and we'll

3723
01:32:10,571 --> 01:32:12,160
go under suck my cock.

3724
01:32:12,161 --> 01:32:14,380
I will say that the banks have
paid back all that money though,

3725
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:15,370
which is pretty impressive.

3726
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:16,270
That is pretty crazy.

3727
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:18,690
It just shows you how quickly
they've been stealing left and right.

3728
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:19,920
Good deal.

3729
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,370
Good government made a
lot of interest on that.

3730
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:23,780
So every bank has paid back.

3731
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:26,080
The money has been paid back and
they made a lot of interests.

3732
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:27,730
So why is the economy fixed?

3733
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:29,440
The economy is not fixed.

3734
01:32:29,441 --> 01:32:31,510
I think primarily because it was fake.

3735
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:32,081
No,

3736
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:37,081
I think that I think that the U S is
having to compete with China and India and

3737
01:32:37,871 --> 01:32:40,960
a lot of other countries and we are truly
becoming a global economy and I don't

3738
01:32:40,961 --> 01:32:42,820
think in a lot of ways to u
s has gotten ready for that,

3739
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:44,980
but we're not making anything
other than Corvettes.

3740
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:46,360
What else do we make this about?

3741
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:51,361
As we made Corvettes and catalogs still
our economy actually still is run on

3742
01:32:51,551 --> 01:32:52,330
ideas.

3743
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:53,350
Although I have a Mustang,

3744
01:32:53,351 --> 01:32:54,710
I have to say it's pretty fucking bad ass.

3745
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:57,220
Do you us the US exports ideas.

3746
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,890
The U s is an ideal kind of economy
and that's good thing to be.

3747
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:01,330
We remember it most.

3748
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:04,810
Most innovation by leaving shot comes out
of the United States in the Mustang is

3749
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:05,410
an idea.

3750
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:08,520
I have a gt 500 it's paper.

3751
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:09,520
It's a stupid car.

3752
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:12,610
It's got a manual transmission
with a cue ball for a shifter.

3753
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,830
It's got a 540 horsepower engine.

3754
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:17,470
Oh my tires slide all over the place.

3755
01:33:17,471 --> 01:33:20,740
Whenever you hit the gas tile tire
slide in second year all the time.

3756
01:33:20,741 --> 01:33:21,850
It's a ridiculous car,

3757
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:26,080
but it's fun as fuck and
it's it truly American car,

3758
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,160
like you hear it,

3759
01:33:27,161 --> 01:33:27,851
the engine,

3760
01:33:27,851 --> 01:33:29,900
the ridiculousness of excessive nature,

3761
01:33:29,901 --> 01:33:30,850
all of it and the end,

3762
01:33:30,851 --> 01:33:31,690
the fun of it.

3763
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,460
It's got a lot of low end torque.

3764
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:33,841
You know,

3765
01:33:33,841 --> 01:33:37,630
you hit that low end torque on a big
fucking eight with a supercharger and hear

3766
01:33:37,631 --> 01:33:38,464
the whine.

3767
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,450
The U s exports,

3768
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,600
a lot of of ideas there.

3769
01:33:42,601 --> 01:33:43,434
I'd and fun.

3770
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:44,620
They're culture is fun.

3771
01:33:44,621 --> 01:33:49,150
Rock and roll is not the only reason why
our culture is fucked up or rather our

3772
01:33:49,151 --> 01:33:50,380
financial systems fucked up.

3773
01:33:50,381 --> 01:33:53,590
It's fucked up because of corruption
and greed and what you said earlier,

3774
01:33:53,591 --> 01:33:54,550
which I always say as well,

3775
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:55,420
it should be real clear.

3776
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:56,560
One piece of gold eagles,

3777
01:33:56,561 --> 01:33:57,340
one donkey.

3778
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:01,450
That's my standard way of when you start
getting into derivatives and shorting

3779
01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:02,201
and gambling.

3780
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:04,060
I mean what does that is the Vegas,

3781
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:04,211
you're,

3782
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:04,510
you're,

3783
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:05,343
you're going Vegas,

3784
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:06,300
gambling.

3785
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,020
But then there's also but there is room,

3786
01:34:08,021 --> 01:34:09,160
there is room to levers,

3787
01:34:09,161 --> 01:34:10,180
there is room for borrowing,

3788
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:12,460
borrowing and credit.

3789
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:17,140
Yes but why is there room for things
like derivatives and shorting and why are

3790
01:34:17,141 --> 01:34:17,974
they allow

3791
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:19,350
relatives and stuff?

3792
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:22,010
What back when it was working a lot of
those derivatives and things like that

3793
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:23,440
allowed people well allow people,

3794
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:26,910
allow people to minimize risk so that
banks would lend money cause they could

3795
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:30,810
minimize risk was distributed and and
as long as that was self contained,

3796
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:32,130
they drew it know,

3797
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,090
put a lot of,

3798
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:34,710
put a lot of our wealth
back into the system.

3799
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:39,320
I think what happened ultimately was
a lot of economists and historians are

3800
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:43,440
starting to talk about this was also
a function of the rise the east.

3801
01:34:43,441 --> 01:34:46,800
It was also a function of the fact
that other countries were buying and

3802
01:34:46,801 --> 01:34:48,540
investing in the US housing market.

3803
01:34:48,541 --> 01:34:49,374
Think about it.

3804
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,820
If you have big,

3805
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:53,160
big central banks who are saying,

3806
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:55,410
we want to buy your housing debt,

3807
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,131
what happens?

3808
01:34:56,131 --> 01:34:58,400
That means I can bundle bundle

3809
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:00,770
mortgages and sell them at a profit.

3810
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:01,963
Guess what?

3811
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,500
It makes it a lot cheaper now.

3812
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:04,670
Now when people get a mortgage,

3813
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:05,481
it's worth something.

3814
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:07,280
Of course I'm going to lend
you a mortgage for no money.

3815
01:35:07,281 --> 01:35:08,540
I can make money on the mortgage,

3816
01:35:08,541 --> 01:35:09,680
I can serve with Germany,

3817
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:13,400
and a lot of it was that a lot
of it was people in this country,

3818
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:15,440
a lot of whom you and I know who said,

3819
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:17,420
I'm going to start treating my
house like it's a commodity.

3820
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:17,930
Not,

3821
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:19,100
not like it's a place to live,

3822
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:19,780
but rather a plate,

3823
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:20,630
a way to make money,

3824
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:22,820
and that was pretty fucking rampant.

3825
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,000
So a lot of this was human overreaction
to a new set of rules to a new world

3826
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:31,000
and just fucking human nature,

3827
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,140
human nature.

3828
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:33,360
When they find holes in the system,

3829
01:35:33,370 --> 01:35:33,890
the Brian's,

3830
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:35,530
you were saying that you
went to occupy Wall Street.

3831
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:36,020
What was that?

3832
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:36,390
Yeah,

3833
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,761
it was.

3834
01:35:36,761 --> 01:35:38,260
It was exactly what I
thought I was going to be.

3835
01:35:38,261 --> 01:35:39,530
What was crazy is that I,

3836
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:41,170
I have these combat boots,

3837
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:41,620
like these,

3838
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:43,390
those a safari combat boots.

3839
01:35:43,391 --> 01:35:45,490
I bought it at a surplus store.

3840
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,700
So I did they think you are a government
decided to wear them because of that

3841
01:35:48,701 --> 01:35:49,061
reason?

3842
01:35:49,061 --> 01:35:50,880
Really the,

3843
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:51,371
I don't know,

3844
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:53,770
just for fun government issue boots.

3845
01:35:53,771 --> 01:35:55,180
So I would think that you're a bad guy.

3846
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:55,601
Yeah.

3847
01:35:55,601 --> 01:35:56,680
Just to see what would happen.

3848
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:57,401
And uh,

3849
01:35:57,401 --> 01:36:02,260
so I parked and amazingly I got a parking
spot right across the street from it.

3850
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:02,540
Yeah.

3851
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:03,520
None of them have cars.

3852
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:04,030
Yeah,

3853
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:04,241
no,

3854
01:36:04,241 --> 01:36:04,391
no.

3855
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:06,550
It was like this cop car pulled
out right when I got there.

3856
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,410
And so like all these people were kind of,

3857
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:08,921
you know,

3858
01:36:08,921 --> 01:36:12,490
like boards sitting on the line staring
at me so I could come up in her is like

3859
01:36:12,491 --> 01:36:14,140
people getting their tits
painted and I'm like,

3860
01:36:14,141 --> 01:36:14,980
this is awesome.

3861
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:15,430
Good.

3862
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:15,671
Yeah,

3863
01:36:15,671 --> 01:36:16,504
that's good.

3864
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:20,590
And then immediately I pull out my phone
and this guy comes up right up to me

3865
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:20,831
and goes,

3866
01:36:20,831 --> 01:36:21,580
hey man,

3867
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:22,391
can I have a cigarette?

3868
01:36:22,391 --> 01:36:23,350
Like right in my face?

3869
01:36:23,351 --> 01:36:23,610
Like,

3870
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:23,930
like,

3871
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:24,100
uh,

3872
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:25,600
he looked like Charles
Manson and I was like,

3873
01:36:25,601 --> 01:36:26,080
Oh shit.

3874
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:26,861
This is a yeah,

3875
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:27,200
sure.

3876
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:27,340
Got,

3877
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:27,911
get out of my face,

3878
01:36:27,911 --> 01:36:28,570
you know,

3879
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:29,920
and then I keep on walking.

3880
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:31,000
I'm looking at my phone now,

3881
01:36:31,001 --> 01:36:33,360
I'm kind of freaking out a little
because I'm by myself and it's,

3882
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,330
it is a little,

3883
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:34,811
I mean,

3884
01:36:34,811 --> 01:36:36,580
I don't know if you've ever
been downtown Los Angeles,

3885
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:37,840
it's kind of scary down.

3886
01:36:37,841 --> 01:36:37,930
Yeah.

3887
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:39,940
We've come a lot of fear
factor episodes down there.

3888
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:40,600
Yeah.

3889
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,900
So there was kind of like this
element around that area that's like,

3890
01:36:43,901 --> 01:36:44,111
hey,

3891
01:36:44,111 --> 01:36:48,200
there's a new apartment complex opening
up for the homeless people type thing.

3892
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:48,331
You know,

3893
01:36:48,331 --> 01:36:48,521
it was,

3894
01:36:48,521 --> 01:36:49,690
cause it was like a village.

3895
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:50,381
They had,

3896
01:36:50,381 --> 01:36:52,060
first day they had libraries,

3897
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,001
they had a,

3898
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:53,740
you know,

3899
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:54,550
they had donate,

3900
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:58,900
there's donations coming in that feed
like this whole entire like block,

3901
01:36:58,930 --> 01:36:59,260
uh,

3902
01:36:59,260 --> 01:36:59,551
you know,

3903
01:36:59,551 --> 01:37:01,150
of the State Capitol building or whatever.

3904
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:01,780
Right.

3905
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:02,230
And,

3906
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:02,950
uh,

3907
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:06,160
then this other guy kind of staring
at me and he comes up to me and goes,

3908
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:06,820
hey man,

3909
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:07,930
can you check the score for me?

3910
01:37:07,931 --> 01:37:09,610
And I'm like a square for wet.

3911
01:37:09,611 --> 01:37:09,971
And he goes,

3912
01:37:09,971 --> 01:37:10,511
Pittsburgh.

3913
01:37:10,511 --> 01:37:11,344
And I'm like,

3914
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:12,183
uh,

3915
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,720
I have no idea what he's talking about.

3916
01:37:13,721 --> 01:37:13,841
Like,

3917
01:37:13,841 --> 01:37:14,080
I'm like,

3918
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:14,440
ah,

3919
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:15,910
so he's asking you check it on your phone.

3920
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,880
Yeah.

3921
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,600
You're asking people
to Google shit for it.

3922
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:21,670
Can I get a cigarette's not good enough.

3923
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:22,930
Now can Google me the score.

3924
01:37:22,931 --> 01:37:25,600
I have a cell phone and the whole
time he's like staring my phone down.

3925
01:37:25,601 --> 01:37:28,900
So I think maybe some high government
issued boots and it was like trying to

3926
01:37:28,901 --> 01:37:29,680
figure out,

3927
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:30,970
cause I had like a shaved head,

3928
01:37:30,971 --> 01:37:32,110
like a military haircut.

3929
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:32,401
Oh.

3930
01:37:32,401 --> 01:37:35,410
And wearing the coat from
taxi driver or whatever.

3931
01:37:35,411 --> 01:37:35,910
You know,

3932
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:39,450
obviously we had Kevin Pereira from attack
of the show on here the other day and

3933
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:41,550
we were talking about agent provocateurs,

3934
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:45,490
government people who were sent in to
break up calm protests and turn them into

3935
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,360
violent protests.

3936
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:47,870
They can bring him in fucking arrest her.

3937
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,270
But it's common tactic.

3938
01:37:49,271 --> 01:37:49,781
It's smart.

3939
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:50,021
Really.

3940
01:37:50,021 --> 01:37:50,501
They get tired.

3941
01:37:50,501 --> 01:37:52,180
All these fucking hippies in their banjos.

3942
01:37:52,181 --> 01:37:54,100
So this guy's kind of
frequently to look out for them.

3943
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:55,200
Uh,

3944
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,310
I've been impressed with how,

3945
01:37:56,311 --> 01:37:56,940
um,

3946
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:59,130
when I hear the occupy Wall Street people,

3947
01:37:59,131 --> 01:38:02,850
a lot of them are people who are actually
educated w who just can't find a job.

3948
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:03,250
Yeah.

3949
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:07,600
And I'm trying to find the answer in the
case as much as I thought it wouldn't

3950
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:07,810
be.

3951
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:08,910
This was mostly,

3952
01:38:08,911 --> 01:38:09,381
by the way,

3953
01:38:09,381 --> 01:38:10,340
we're not in Wall Street.

3954
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:12,263
No,

3955
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:15,150
it doesn't really have a financial,

3956
01:38:15,151 --> 01:38:17,700
I mean it's just a small
financial district,

3957
01:38:17,701 --> 01:38:18,780
but it smelled like,

3958
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:22,890
I don't even know where he would
occupy downtown law by Los Angeles.

3959
01:38:22,891 --> 01:38:25,440
He's got clothing companies
and the government buildings.

3960
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,810
So this guy is like
kind of freaking me out.

3961
01:38:27,811 --> 01:38:29,910
Like it's like checking me up
and down and stuff like that.

3962
01:38:29,911 --> 01:38:30,421
And I'm like,

3963
01:38:30,421 --> 01:38:30,751
all right,

3964
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:31,584
this is kind of sad.

3965
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:32,550
You get for trolling.

3966
01:38:32,551 --> 01:38:32,970
I fuck.

3967
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:33,361
I know,

3968
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:33,670
I know.

3969
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:36,400
But then my friend who's running like the,

3970
01:38:36,401 --> 01:38:39,090
the live stream and all the media
coverage of the whole place,

3971
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,370
he called me over and
so kind of rescue me.

3972
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:44,050
And so I go through was like my friend,

3973
01:38:44,051 --> 01:38:44,281
see,

3974
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:45,090
hang,

3975
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,310
he's a c hung on a Twitter.

3976
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:47,820
Uh,

3977
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:48,390
so,

3978
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:48,900
uh,

3979
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:52,380
there was a rap battle going on up on
stage because there's entertainment

3980
01:38:52,381 --> 01:38:53,041
throughout the day.

3981
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:53,970
There's speakers,

3982
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:56,760
there's like local musicians and comics,

3983
01:38:56,761 --> 01:38:57,001
you know,

3984
01:38:57,001 --> 01:38:57,880
like Jeffrey Ross,

3985
01:38:57,881 --> 01:38:58,570
Jeff,

3986
01:38:58,570 --> 01:38:59,310
yeah.

3987
01:38:59,310 --> 01:38:59,891
And so,

3988
01:38:59,891 --> 01:39:00,090
uh,

3989
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:00,923
it was fine.

3990
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,700
I sat there and watched this
rap concert for why were they,

3991
01:39:03,701 --> 01:39:07,440
people are handing off the mic and this
homeless guy was like looking guy with

3992
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:12,100
like balancing like pop cans
on his head while rapping.

3993
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:12,361
I was like,

3994
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:12,601
wow,

3995
01:39:12,601 --> 01:39:13,440
you don't see this everyday.

3996
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:13,950
You know.

3997
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:15,360
So it was like the entertainment value,

3998
01:39:15,361 --> 01:39:16,194
it's pretty sweet.

3999
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,060
Smelled like boo though like crazy.

4000
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:20,970
And then they took me through the
media event where they do all the live

4001
01:39:20,971 --> 01:39:25,110
interviews and all the media stuff
and it's all like generators and solar

4002
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:26,040
collectors.

4003
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:29,360
And then there's tons of computers and
then there's this girl is just out of

4004
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:31,200
nowhere comes up to my
friends see and was like,

4005
01:39:31,201 --> 01:39:31,381
Hey,

4006
01:39:31,381 --> 01:39:34,920
I want to donate these laptops
and gave him like three laptops.

4007
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:35,371
And I was like,

4008
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:35,551
wow,

4009
01:39:35,551 --> 01:39:36,420
this is really bad ass.

4010
01:39:36,421 --> 01:39:39,420
I need to start occupying Burbank
outside of best buy or something,

4011
01:39:39,421 --> 01:39:39,691
you know,

4012
01:39:39,691 --> 01:39:40,524
and get some shit.

4013
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,810
Uh Oh Brian,

4014
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:44,003
silly.

4015
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,130
But then they took me through the
whole thing and there was like drums,

4016
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:47,250
drum circles.

4017
01:39:47,251 --> 01:39:48,150
There was like it,

4018
01:39:48,151 --> 01:39:48,781
it seemed pretty cool.

4019
01:39:48,781 --> 01:39:50,760
And I guess that I've never
seen a good drum circle.

4020
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:52,051
Never been there.

4021
01:39:52,051 --> 01:39:53,100
Well I fucked this.

4022
01:39:53,101 --> 01:39:58,101
Is this PLO drums and if anything it
seems like the more I walked around I,

4023
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:01,470
I did see like the people trying
to sit down and come up with,

4024
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,970
with solutions and ideas.

4025
01:40:02,971 --> 01:40:05,160
So you did see the good part of what's,

4026
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:07,110
but the majority of it was just like,

4027
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:09,250
it looked like a bunch of deadheads.

4028
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,430
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

4029
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,660
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

4030
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:15,450
I think that's just going to be the
case no matter what with any sort of a

4031
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:15,930
movement.

4032
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:17,790
But this was a very exciting time,

4033
01:40:17,791 --> 01:40:18,031
man.

4034
01:40:18,031 --> 01:40:21,090
There's never been a time where this
many people have got together and had a

4035
01:40:21,091 --> 01:40:22,410
peaceful demonstration.

4036
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:23,910
It was pooping in a shit.

4037
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,890
Shitting in the street is
not exactly a peaceful,

4038
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:27,630
he's a little bit of
violence involved in that.

4039
01:40:27,631 --> 01:40:28,790
But you know the,

4040
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,450
they're shitting all
over the fucking street.

4041
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:31,550
You go anywhere near Wall Street.

4042
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:32,350
Yeah,

4043
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:32,880
the shitting.

4044
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:33,713
Oh God.

4045
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,080
It smells like human shit everywhere.

4046
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:37,470
I felt like such an ass,

4047
01:40:37,471 --> 01:40:39,240
cause I had a tin can and there was this,

4048
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:41,070
there's three different
colors of trash cans.

4049
01:40:41,071 --> 01:40:42,090
Like the green trash.

4050
01:40:42,091 --> 01:40:43,080
It's black and the blue.

4051
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:43,800
Oh,

4052
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:44,490
I'm sitting here going,

4053
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:45,121
which one is it?

4054
01:40:45,121 --> 01:40:46,680
Green is green as grass blue.

4055
01:40:46,681 --> 01:40:47,251
What's blue?

4056
01:40:47,251 --> 01:40:48,040
That's waiting.

4057
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,080
It's like water bottles.

4058
01:40:49,081 --> 01:40:51,080
And this is a can is a black.

4059
01:40:51,081 --> 01:40:51,630
I just throw it.

4060
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:53,540
So I'm like trying to figure it coated.

4061
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:54,010
They didn't have

4062
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,131
like,

4063
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:54,964
it didn't save her.

4064
01:40:55,610 --> 01:40:57,040
It was a green trashcan of blue.

4065
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:57,190
Oh,

4066
01:40:57,190 --> 01:40:57,761
that's ridiculous.

4067
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:58,451
I think it's supposed to be.

4068
01:40:58,451 --> 01:40:59,470
You're supposed to know the colors.

4069
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,610
Human Shit still bothering.

4070
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:00,970
Yeah,

4071
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:01,870
they shit everywhere man.

4072
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:02,741
Well they have to,

4073
01:41:02,741 --> 01:41:02,921
you know,

4074
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:04,060
there's a lot of people sleeping there,

4075
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,710
but people have their
kids there and everything.

4076
01:41:05,711 --> 01:41:06,870
Port-A-Potties this is,

4077
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:07,640
yeah.

4078
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,473
Then sometimes

4079
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:11,051
they can't.

4080
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:11,231
Okay.

4081
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:11,860
But this again,

4082
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:13,060
we're talking about the Los Angeles.

4083
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:15,940
Los Angeles one is a different animal
than the write up one New York one man,

4084
01:41:15,941 --> 01:41:18,310
the videos in New York one
is there really a shocking,

4085
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:20,140
and here's what's really crazy.

4086
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:21,910
The Wall Street,

4087
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:22,240
uh,

4088
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:22,750
has a,

4089
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:25,660
not only have they donated four
point $6 million to the police,

4090
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:28,270
but they also started hiring the police.

4091
01:41:28,271 --> 01:41:29,590
It's something that
most people don't know.

4092
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:33,340
You can hire a police officer
for roughly $37 an hour.

4093
01:41:33,490 --> 01:41:38,490
So all of these Wall Street firms are
hiring tons of cops off duty cops to do,

4094
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:38,860
uh,

4095
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:39,250
you know,

4096
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:40,240
paid work there.

4097
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:44,230
And they work as a police officer with
a real badge and a real gun and the real

4098
01:41:44,231 --> 01:41:45,430
ability ability to arrest.

4099
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:47,050
But they're working for the bank.

4100
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:47,551
So the,

4101
01:41:47,551 --> 01:41:47,830
they,

4102
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:48,360
it's a,

4103
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:51,940
it's a loophole where
these are police officers,

4104
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:54,310
but they are doing the
bidding of the bank.

4105
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,780
They are doing that.

4106
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:57,790
They're working for the bank.

4107
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:59,440
They're not like the bank says,

4108
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,240
Hey,

4109
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:00,510
uh,

4110
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:01,360
police officers,

4111
01:42:01,361 --> 01:42:04,900
can you organize your own police
presence around this area?

4112
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:05,330
And,

4113
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:05,590
you know,

4114
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:09,850
put as many police officers you see fit
and I guess you guys work for the state

4115
01:42:09,851 --> 01:42:10,361
and you know,

4116
01:42:10,361 --> 01:42:10,991
maybe we'll,

4117
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:11,201
uh,

4118
01:42:11,201 --> 01:42:11,471
we'll,

4119
01:42:11,471 --> 01:42:14,770
we'll throw in a picnic for ya and we'll
help generate some money to pay for all

4120
01:42:14,771 --> 01:42:16,390
this extra revenue that's going to cost.

4121
01:42:17,550 --> 01:42:18,230
They're paying,

4122
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:19,063
but

4123
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:22,960
they're paying the cops so
they tell the cops where to go.

4124
01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:24,730
I didn't know it.

4125
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:25,100
It's,

4126
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:25,960
it's fucking crazy.

4127
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:26,923
I was legal.

4128
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:27,220
It's,

4129
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:27,761
yes,

4130
01:42:27,761 --> 01:42:28,660
you should think it shouldn't be,

4131
01:42:28,661 --> 01:42:29,400
but it was a I,

4132
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:32,230
I think a Koch Mayor
Koch came up with that.

4133
01:42:32,231 --> 01:42:34,180
I think it was in the
90s that they had that.

4134
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:34,510
Yeah,

4135
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:35,231
I think the biggest,

4136
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:35,481
you know,

4137
01:42:35,481 --> 01:42:36,314
and people have always had it.

4138
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:41,980
I think the biggest threat facing all
of us is as far as this whole situation

4139
01:42:42,021 --> 01:42:42,681
talking about this,

4140
01:42:42,681 --> 01:42:47,681
I think the real enemy is that we are
slowly or maybe very quickly losing our

4141
01:42:47,811 --> 01:42:48,950
representative government.

4142
01:42:48,951 --> 01:42:51,070
And what I mean by that is that this,

4143
01:42:51,071 --> 01:42:53,810
this government and James
Madison warned warned about this.

4144
01:42:53,811 --> 01:42:54,141
He said,

4145
01:42:54,141 --> 01:42:56,990
the one thing you have to be careful
of in a democracy like this is special

4146
01:42:56,991 --> 01:42:58,030
interests because,

4147
01:42:58,090 --> 01:43:01,370
because the constitution says you are
allowed to petition your government,

4148
01:43:01,371 --> 01:43:02,450
that's a constitutional right.

4149
01:43:02,451 --> 01:43:03,800
It should be a constitutional right.

4150
01:43:03,801 --> 01:43:08,801
The problem is that our country now
is being run by small bands of very

4151
01:43:09,261 --> 01:43:09,861
energetic,

4152
01:43:09,861 --> 01:43:12,110
well-financed fanatics.

4153
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:12,670
And,

4154
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:15,830
and when you are a representative
in the House of Representatives,

4155
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,450
if you are a congressman,

4156
01:43:17,451 --> 01:43:18,680
if you are even a senator,

4157
01:43:18,681 --> 01:43:19,514
but especially in Congress,

4158
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:25,030
you don't do a goddamn thing unless
you check what that lobby and checking

4159
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:29,960
unless you check with the people that
finance your campaign and the people that

4160
01:43:29,961 --> 01:43:31,430
have real power in Washington,

4161
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:34,490
our fundraisers and lobbying groups.

4162
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:35,150
Now,

4163
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:36,170
James Madison said,

4164
01:43:36,171 --> 01:43:37,850
what's going to happen is these lobbyists,

4165
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:40,040
lobbyists will offset each
other with their different,

4166
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:42,620
and it'll be competing interests
and stuff hasn't happened.

4167
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:43,401
In fact,

4168
01:43:43,401 --> 01:43:46,790
what seems to be happening is that some
of these groups have so much fucking

4169
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:47,390
money.

4170
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:49,460
And if you look at Potomac
where they're all live,

4171
01:43:49,461 --> 01:43:50,930
or just Washington area,

4172
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:52,041
that is,

4173
01:43:52,041 --> 01:43:54,920
that is the highest per
capita income in the country.

4174
01:43:54,921 --> 01:43:55,910
Why do they produce.
