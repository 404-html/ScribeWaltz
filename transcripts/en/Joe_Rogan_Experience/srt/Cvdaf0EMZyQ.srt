1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,620
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is unprecedented occurrence here.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,000
Josh Barnett was on his way and not only
did he run into ridiculous traffic,

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:12,001
but Josh is so gangster.
He drives a 1969 automobile around and 

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:16,610
unfortunately got a flat tire.
He drove that bitch all the way up 

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,861
because it work on.
You could throw that pitch all the way 

6
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:19,861
from Orange County.
You do that on a regular basis.

7
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,280
Yeah,
I bought the thing to be a daily driver,

8
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,290
you know,
and uh,

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,300
I got kind of tired of how.
I mean I don't drive anything 

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,730
passionless,
but I just want to drive an old car.

11
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:30,450
I,
I just,

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,290
I liked the simplicity of it.
I like the noise.

13
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,550
I like the feel of it.
So.

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,440
And plus it's not,
it's not anything super special.

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,790
It doesn't have a bunch of fancy motard 
outbreaks and all.

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,870
No,
it's all pretty much old school 

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:45,870
technology.
I know exactly what I'm dealing with and

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,160
stuff breaks.
I can fix it.

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:48,940
Not a problem.

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,490
You don't,
it doesn't bother you.

21
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:52,110
The,
it takes a long time for those things to

22
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:54,300
slow down.
Trying to brace,

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,300
uh,
you gotta account

24
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,560
for that.
This is true.

25
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,140
Um,
I don't know.

26
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm used to driving old cars all my 
life.

27
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,220
I've driven a lot worse than this and I 
do have a,

28
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,270
I have a rear disk conversion kit,
so it will be four wheel disc brakes.

29
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:11,180
It's still going to take way longer to 
stop and say my challenger,

30
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,160
but I'm okay with that.

31
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,210
Yeah.
Once he drive a modern version of a 

32
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,210
muscle car,
like,

33
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,210
oh,
why can't you just do this with a better

34
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,831
interior?
Why can't you do this with like an old 

35
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:22,831
school interior?
Like make it like that.

36
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:24,850
It's just,
I like a car that can start,

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,360
like when you want to start it and start
start.

38
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,000
Sure.

39
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,820
My color turns right over every single 
time.

40
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:34,010
Just go boom.
Just goes.

41
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,800
Just super,
super clean.

42
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:38,160
So it's runs great.
It's 100 percent reliable.

43
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,750
It's that it is 100 percent reliable and
I'm putting a,

44
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:44,230
a overdrive tranny in it.
I'm doing things here.

45
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:45,720
Things are.
And uh,

46
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,510
it will be.
I just want basically a high 14 second 

47
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,170
quarter mile car that you can drive 
everywhere and never.

48
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,450
Yeah.
And See I can't even enough alone.

49
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:57,520
It's got.
It's got a peg leg in it right now,

50
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:00,070
so I got to put a pause unit in it.
That just has to happen.

51
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,650
You are,
you like the quintessential boy turned 

52
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,540
man metal music cage fighting muscle 
cars.

53
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,400
It's all of the quintessential manly 
type shit

54
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,870
somebody ever asked me like,
so.

55
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:17,720
So what are you really good at?
Doing manly shit.

56
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,500
Making manly faces while I do manly 
shit.

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Like I can,
I can look inquisitive and I can stare 

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,350
off in the distance and I can hold a 
cigar in my mouth and I can.

59
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,210
I can put grease in the right places.

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,250
Yeah.
You gotta cover all as a whole manly 

61
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,250
repertoire.

62
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,270
Yeah.
Which is good because it offsets,

63
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,040
you know,
all the Times that I'm wearing panties,

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,640
it offsets the society too as a distinct
lack of manliness going on.

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,860
It does the uh,
the boobs are not just on the women 

66
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:48,860
anymore.
Yeah,

67
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:48,860
it's not,
you know,

68
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,280
there's a lot of that.
There's a lot of,

69
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,480
a lot of,
you know,

70
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,350
men are giving into what women like 
because if you don't,

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,930
you get labeled,
you know,

72
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,790
you,
if you like all the shit that you like,

73
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,800
you get labeled,
you like you're a chauvinist,

74
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,570
your uptake,
there's something wrong with you.

75
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,400
You're a meathead,
you're a metal head.

76
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,180
Know what,
uh,

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,130
you get labeled as being someone you 
know,

78
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,260
undesirable or slightly immature.

79
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,930
I know,
I love the fact that,

80
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,000
uh,
so I blamed skinny jeans for all that.

81
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,760
But yeah,

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,920
skinny jeans are ridiculous.
If you can't sprawl in your pants,

83
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,970
then you shouldn't be wearing them.
If you couldn't throw it,

84
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,900
at least a body kick and your pants,
you shouldn't be wearing them.

85
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,110
You shouldn't be wearing something that 
you have to struggle to get out of or in

86
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,570
that shits they're seeing maybe those

87
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,400
chuck norris karate pants,
the karate denims with a gusset crotch.

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,290
We'll come back in to round out anybody 
in the face.

89
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:47,291
No problem.
We need to get like a true religion 

90
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,470
version of the Chuck Norris Jeans.
Like they need to combine forces,

91
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,560
club pants,
high kicks with the ultimate.

92
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,770
The ultimate Ninja Douche bagger.
Oh,

93
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,810
could you imagine just the commercials 
we guys throwing roundhouse kicks with 

94
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,371
their,
with their foot slip on shoes and our 

95
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,980
fucking heavily monogrammed glittery 
shirts.

96
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,260
Throw,
throw in karate,

97
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:11,000
roundhouse kicks.
But uh,

98
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,170
as far as like labels like I been 
labeled all my life.

99
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,230
I wasn't a nerd,
a Dork and I was an outcast kid,

100
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:23,231
you know,
and I liked weird shit like foreign 

101
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:26,291
films and Gore movies and anime and 
comic books and we'd go to the race 

102
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,941
track with my family and classic cars 
and just all kinds of weird fucked up 

103
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:31,420
shit were,
you know,

104
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,430
I could.
I'm captain of the football team but 

105
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,650
nobody else knows what the fuck I what 
tip I'm on.

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,760
They're just going,
dude,

107
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:38,330
you're a Weirdo.

108
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,860
Is this where you always attracted to 
being into shit that was like away from 

109
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,640
the crowd or is that just the stuff that
you liked?

110
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,410
Both.
Both.

111
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,240
I mean,
I,

112
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:53,241
I grew up in that weird era where cable 
came about and so they would fill the 

113
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,930
airways full of whatever cheap shit they
could get.

114
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,030
And that ended up being a lot of weird 
shit,

115
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,790
a lot of weird shit from,
from Japan,

116
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:05,791
from everywhere.
And then I had a fixation with horror 

117
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,730
movies as a kid and that lead to other 
places,

118
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:11,731
you know,
all of a sudden the cycle Friday the 

119
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:11,731
13th is cool,
but I didn't really get to see that head

120
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:12,400
get crushed.
So where,

121
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,750
where can I pick that up at?
You know,

122
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,610
what movies got that in it.
So yeah,

123
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,740
the faces of death.
Did you get into all that?

124
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,990
Actually I was more into like the 
Italian,

125
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:24,991
like full cheese Zombie movies and stuff
or they're horrible and the dubbing is 

126
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,290
the worst ever.
But you know,

127
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,620
people are like vomiting out their 
insights,

128
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,720
you know,
vaginas start talking and eating things,

129
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,230
whatever.
If that's a movie,

130
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:36,370
you should probably see it.

131
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,740
And there was a whole series in like,
I guess it was the sixties and the 

132
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,060
seventies of just what they would call 
Gore movies.

133
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:49,210
What movies were unbelievably gory.
Like I remember I picked up a magazine 

134
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,090
about at once.
It just,

135
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:52,460
you know,
it was one of those just looking through

136
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:54,080
random magazines like what the fuck is 
his,

137
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:57,950
like Fangoria,
and it was all about one type of

138
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,070
Gore film at this one duties to make it

139
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,230
herschell Gordon Lewis,
stuff like that hasn't maniacs.

140
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,590
And I think that's it.
And uh,

141
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:06,250
the wizard of Gore.
Yeah.

142
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
And so he came out,
he,

143
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:10,550
when they were making like these,
I think they're x rated at the time,

144
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,700
they weren't hardcore but like these,
these exploitation films at one point,

145
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,800
and then it was like,
that wasn't enough.

146
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:21,390
So they created this movie.
They showed people getting their tongues

147
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:24,090
cutoff and I mean they're really cheesy,
so bad,

148
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,120
but still starving,
but back then it really fucked people's 

149
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,120
minds up.
Yeah.

150
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,150
And uh,
and that was,

151
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,980
you know,
that was just,

152
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,660
that was their new thing.
All of a sudden the audience was flipped

153
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,160
out about it and they had to get more of
it.

154
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,810
Yeah.
I remember seeing that as a little kid 

155
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:40,810
going,
woo,

156
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,480
fuck wants to wash this.
Like this is just disturbing.

157
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,140
Like I understand a good Zombie movie,
a good vampire movie,

158
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,280
you know,
something fun.

159
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,610
Well,
who the fuck wants to watch people just 

160
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:51,610
get chopped up like that.

161
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,410
That's a lot of people know with the,
uh,

162
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,720
with you've got the whole,
um,

163
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,680
what was that?
Uh,

164
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,040
Eli Roth thing,
a torture film.

165
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,830
But they had.
Oh yeah.

166
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,780
Which I can't remember.
They've done.

167
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:08,781
Two of them I think were the travelers 
end up in Romania and then they get into

168
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:11,100
some place by hobbits.
Hostile.

169
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,620
Hostile.
Yeah.

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,690
Yeah.
I only saw the first one.

171
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,150
Right.
And then,

172
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:18,950
and then of course even the rich people 
will pay to the court.

173
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,540
But honestly,
really it's all the women's fault.

174
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,250
The chicks lured them in those course.
Vagina ruins lives.

175
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,110
They,
it certainly can,

176
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,090
you know,
you go up for a piece of strange and you

177
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:33,300
get a fucking splinters shoved into your
eye.

178
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,340
That's what happens.
It can happen.

179
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,050
No.
And there's no protection for that.

180
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:38,420
Like they don't make a condom for that 
one.

181
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:38,810
No.
You,

182
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,280
you fought all over the world,
right?

183
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,680
I mean,
if you're a fun Russia,

184
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,720
I have never fallen Russia.
Um,

185
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,840
do you ever hear he's hearing this 
description of going to the hospital and

186
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,110
it looked like dawn of he dead bodies 
laying out there and just stitching 

187
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,870
people up in front of you and you're 
like,

188
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:56,970
what the fuck is going on man?
Love bodies like laying on,

189
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,740
on like vodka probably for an 
antiseptic.

190
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,910
Yeah.
And that was during the dark age when 

191
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:05,910
the,
uh,

192
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,960
the Soviet Union collapsed.
So I think times were really fucking 

193
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:08,960
hard there for a long time.

194
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,820
I'm sure there's still some of that to 
be found over in Russia because it's 

195
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:13,820
such a difference.
And,

196
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,010
and class at this point it's like the 
uber rich and then there's not,

197
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,780
not really a middleclass to my 
understanding people.

198
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,050
That's why I'm moving like hostile works
because you know,

199
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,420
you look at these pretty girls and 
you're like,

200
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,180
if they were really cold hearted killers
from Russia,

201
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,720
they could sneak you in,
pull your butt cheeks apart until you 

202
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,371
died.
I wonder if they really are that people 

203
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:40,191
that are willing to pay people to go 
about thinking about all the perverted 

204
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:41,760
shit that we think about.
Right.

205
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:46,761
And then we go and then we go look up 
and watch on the Internet while 

206
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:47,880
masturbating,
so to speak for yourself.

207
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,710
Some of us,
some of us are easily amused.

208
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,870
Uh,
but the thing being is that you can 

209
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,870
think of all kinds,
fucked up,

210
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,490
weird fetish and there is at least a 
handful of people out there.

211
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:04,491
They're going to do it.
Anything you can imagine someone's 

212
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:04,491
doing.

213
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:06,530
I just couldn't imagine someone being 
able to organize a place where you could

214
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:11,531
actually go to torture people.
I feel like somebody is going to tell 

215
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:11,760
this.
This is good.

216
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:11,830
Okay.

217
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,920
Fall apart.
I just,

218
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,550
I don't,
I don't put anything past humanity is 

219
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,521
the most fucked up thing.
And the most beautiful thing is easily 

220
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:21,680
as one of the other.

221
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,580
Have you ever seen the Bohemian Grove 
footage?

222
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,230
Do you know anything about Bohemian 
Grove?

223
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,880
No.
It sounds like a bunch of hippies.

224
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,440
No,
just the opposite.

225
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,320
A bunch of like banker type dudes and a 
dignitaries from foreign countries and,

226
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,430
and like skull and bones type dudes.
They get together and who knows what the

227
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:42,370
fuck is really going on?
But they have this giant Molek,

228
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:44,860
the owl God,
and they all dress up in robes.

229
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:46,450
It's ridiculous.
I mean,

230
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,370
it's been proven that there's a secret.

231
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,570
Sounds like larping,
larping,

232
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,920
larping black factored roleplaying.
Oh,

233
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,260
running around

234
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,240
when these guys that are in skull and 
bones and there's a lot of weird,

235
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,120
silly,
ritualistic shit that they are doing.

236
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,380
And apparently they're literally are 
people to this day,

237
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:15,381
I don't mean the Alex Jones broke into 
it and it was over a decade ago and 

238
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:15,530
filmed it.
These fucking people are.

239
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,240
They're burning in effigy.
They have sticks wrapped up there,

240
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,760
burning it for the sacrifice of the owl 
God.

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,760
Man.
This is like,

242
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,770
he's like millionaires and it's

243
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,460
I.
They couldn't have chose something 

244
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:29,460
better than that.
Molex a bad motherfucker,

245
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:29,520
dude.
Apparently.

246
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:30,390
I don't know.
I've never.

247
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,480
I know that there are topics carry 
everything,

248
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,050
but why not a grizzly bear?
That would definitely be scary than it.

249
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,880
That will totally be scary.
It makes it even gnarlier noise.

250
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:46,881
I was.
Don't sound scary and it took a long 

251
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:49,521
time from Allah kill you and you 
probably would win if you had to go toe 

252
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:50,300
to toe in an owl.
I put my money on myself.

253
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,280
Fuck yeah.
All you need to do is grab a hold of his

254
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:56,660
neck was not any kind of defenses and 
will have not even like a,

255
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,700
it could flesh out whenever we're 
talking about what we're talking about 

256
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:01,700
life and death and kill it,
kill it.

257
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,610
But even a small brown bear,
black bear,

258
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,620
I'll fuck you up man.
Kind of bears are scared of you so you 

259
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:09,620
don't have to worry about them as much.

260
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,030
But uh,
you know,

261
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,960
if he wanted to fucking cat man,
30 pound cat,

262
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:15,240
scary as shit.
I do have a desire,

263
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,840
I don't think I'll ever make it happen 
to have like a cougar sized cat is like 

264
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,800
my,
my pet.

265
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,140
And I don't mean like pet,
like I want to lock it around on a 

266
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,201
leash.
I just want someone to break into my 

267
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:30,201
house while I'm gone.
So you know the,

268
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:30,630
the variation being,
Oh,

269
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:33,600
you got your dogs,
they're the Robert Breaks in or whatever

270
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:35,580
the dog,
they run away.

271
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,050
Well the cat,
the drama breaks in,

272
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,750
she's keeps stealing shit.
Right?

273
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:44,751
And he's like,
unhooking your TV and all of this and 

274
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:47,780
all of a sudden there's going to hear 
that roar from a Puma and it's on his 

275
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,540
neck just murdering him.
So you come home and you're like,

276
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,470
oh,
I see you had someone to play with while

277
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,130
I was gone.

278
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,030
They see that if you see a mountain lion
first,

279
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,060
that it's very likely that he's not 
going to attack you if you see him 

280
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,060
first.
I couldn't believe that a pcs,

281
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,810
you first,
he might not be able to resist it.

282
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,480
You know,
if he knows that you don't know what the

283
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:12,481
fuck has happened,
that that rush of just creeping up on 

284
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,421
you.
And Jack knew bushwhacking speech so 

285
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:15,421
far.
I mean that's what they love.

286
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:16,020
So what they should do is I should get

287
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,140
mountain lions to be the ones that 
spread the gospel of Jesus around 

288
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,140
because then nobody would know that they
were around.

289
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,450
They could sneak up on you and I,

290
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,680
Hey,
you haven't been to talk about our Lord 

291
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:28,680
and Savior.
You're like,

292
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:28,680
fuck,
where'd you come from?

293
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,150
They would do it a little differently 
than they would introduce you to them 

294
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,521
immediately.
At least if you get killed by a cat 

295
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,910
though,
they kill you know,

296
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,700
barriers.
Just start eating it.

297
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:40,650
Just hold it down and start eating you.
That's,

298
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,600
that's a lot more of a pain in the ass 
here.

299
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:47,601
But that guy in Africa student,
he got eaten by a bear fucked up by 

300
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:47,890
chimpanzees.
Oh,

301
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,400
they dragged him a mile,
dragged him a mile,

302
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,460
beat the fucking shit out of him,
dragged them under a fence and then 

303
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,910
dragged them like,
can we blame Kubrick for that?

304
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,660
Well,
these chimps were all problem chimps.

305
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,390
They were all chimps that had been in 
zoo's and captivity.

306
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:07,300
They were trying to reintroduce that CDC
problem.

307
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:11,810
Champs should be.
Somebody should have a problem.

308
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,650
Chips are,
but they're not.

309
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,010
They're not even wild chimps.
Chimps that they're trying to 

310
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,610
reintroduce the wild zoo champs circus 
champions.

311
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,000
So they're like,
I needed therapy.

312
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,980
And then these chimps.
Sure.

313
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,250
They finally got issue as well.
A lot of those chimps,

314
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,070
first of all,
I think they get milk,

315
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,170
mental illness,
if you're naturally a supposed to be in 

316
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,681
a wild situation where you're all your 
instincts are tuned into protecting 

317
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:37,780
yourself,
looking around,

318
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:41,050
making sure that nothing sneaking up on 
you and yet you live in front of a giant

319
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:45,310
glass wall where every day these weird 
pink monkeys are staring at you and your

320
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:48,670
senses are going off and you have you 
don't know what the fuck to do.

321
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,040
He just becomes normal and you get used 
to it,

322
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,650
but every day you probably go crazy.
They're probably crazy.

323
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,210
It's completely unnatural environment

324
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,270
because they have the the higher brain 
capacity to to to to logically work out 

325
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,550
what's going on,
where they're at,

326
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:08,551
how this,
how this whole deal works and how many 

327
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:08,551
of them are or abused.

328
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:08,700
I think a lot.
I think a lot of them get abused.

329
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:13,701
You know,
that's the scenario that took place in 

330
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:14,490
that a planet of the apes movie,
the most recent one was that one guy was

331
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:16,290
an asshole spraying the champs with the 
hose.

332
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,790
I'm sure that happens.
I'm sure they the news,

333
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,620
and I'm sure they're assholes too.
I should.

334
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:24,510
They do country things and you want to 
fucking spray the chimp with a hose.

335
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,990
I wouldn't doubt that for a second.
Have you seen him raping frogs?

336
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,890
Ooh,
yeah.

337
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:30,720
It's hilarious.
But fuck a frog.

338
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,010
Who put them in.
What they do?

339
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,470
Throw the frog in there at some point.
Like monkey ruthless frog.

340
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,480
I wonder if it was just a natural 
occurrence.

341
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:41,430
The frog just fucked up and wound up 
there,

342
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,820
but a lot of them though,
they have like a thing where you can't 

343
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:46,820
climb out.

344
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,800
Yeah.
So I think there's some like 19 year old

345
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:52,400
zookeeper dip shit.
He's like people and animals.

346
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,490
What a strange combination.
It's going to be real weird if we find 

347
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,281
out that something much smarter than us 
because we're going to have to figure 

348
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:01,670
out how to convince it to not put us in 
a zoo.

349
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,290
I think about the way we treat all this 
shit that's just barely a little less.

350
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,320
A little less than us.
I don't think that they would have to be

351
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:11,570
convinced.
I think we do it to ourselves anyways,

352
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,090
probably reality television.
We're,

353
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,170
we're,
you know,

354
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,200
the idea of sticking out behind a cage 
and letting us act like the biggest 

355
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,240
assholes we could possibly think of a 
generally in New Jersey.

356
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,950
Uh,
then there you go.

357
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,180
It's ratings.
Wonder.

358
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Yeah.
Housewives that shows like a human zoo 

359
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,380
and a lot of ways or that's part of the 
appeal is that you don't know anybody 

360
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,380
like that.

361
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,390
You're not hanging out.
You're not introducing anybody like 

362
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:38,390
those idiots in your life,
but yet you can watch them,

363
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,490
you know,
like the men posturing with each other.

364
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,370
I'm going to call him Joseph Feed.
He's a fucking girl.

365
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,660
That one.
You're like,

366
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:45,980
whoa.
I do you hear yourself?

367
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,960
This is an actual.
You're a grown man.

368
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Josephine.
That's a pretty complex for calling 

369
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,490
another won't really common common and 
Jersey Grandmother's name Josephine,

370
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,520
Italian woman's name.
It's very common,

371
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,650
but the guy was joe who's calling 
Josephine,

372
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,200
meaning you'd go to a fulcrum,
use a little girl.

373
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:05,380
I'm cooling.
My girls knew like,

374
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,660
what kind of asshole would you.
I mean,

375
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,140
would you ever let that guy in your 
house,

376
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,510
would you ever hang out with him?
If anybody like that was talking to your

377
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:16,511
house?
He would immediately start mocking them 

378
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:16,511
and you would go get the fuck out of 
here.

379
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:17,810
I'm probably married.
That's your type.

380
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,400
Oh,
I love it.

381
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,600
Oh,
oiled up.

382
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,720
Spiky hair and lots of,
uh,

383
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,710
lots of big earrings.
Steroids.

384
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,330
Oh,
totally.

385
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,650
To Stop.
Big Hoop earrings.

386
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:33,090
Those are very important.
Something about the daring dual hoop dj 

387
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,830
on the side.
I did the stretch.

388
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,220
Things start happening.
There's two,

389
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,820
I don't know,
I don't know when the plug thing started

390
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:41,860
happening.
I know like,

391
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,540
I mean there was a piercing kids.

392
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,550
We're into that and it was like a 
certain kind of a certain kind of scene 

393
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,470
want to do that.
And then like hipsters started doing it 

394
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,990
like indie kids are kids and then it 
started to grow,

395
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:55,530
grow,
grow,

396
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:56,960
and then,
well,

397
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,840
and you know,
at some point,

398
00:16:57,841 --> 00:17:02,841
okay,
let's say you don't want to fucking 

399
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:02,841
hearing anymore.
You don't have to wear an earring,

400
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:05,481
but we just fucking mangled your ear 
into some weird grown out disc like once

401
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,500
you get over that,
I don't know.

402
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,580
Uh,
I suppose they like loop it over the 

403
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,140
rest of the year.
They cut it back.

404
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,820
I've heard someone say that he can do 
whatever.

405
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:18,210
I'm like,
well,

406
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:19,590
who wants to go through all of that?

407
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,350
That's a pain in the ass.
And then what did you get?

408
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:22,470
Staff?
Yeah,

409
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,210
you're stupid.
Yeah.

410
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,660
There's two things that always troubled 
me in our culture.

411
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:30,560
Like how does that get that far?
Because I understand,

412
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,480
you know,
in other cultures have been doing things

413
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:35,300
for thousands of years and the Thai 
stick fucking robots.

414
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,940
You're living in a jungle and I mean,
you're not even trying to be about 

415
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,180
modernization.
You're just living your life.

416
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,250
But in this country there's that.
There's the ear thing and then there's 

417
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,181
the fucking saggy pants thing,
the saggy pants and kills me more near 

418
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:51,181
thing.
The saggy

419
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:51,340
pants thing is,
uh,

420
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,900
I can't believe if you came up to me and
the 19 eighties and said these things,

421
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,810
saggy pants are still be around 2012.
There's no way.

422
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:02,610
It's so dumb.
I can't believe it's here now.

423
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:03,270
I'm like,
trust me,

424
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,940
it's not going to last.
They don't even know what it's from.

425
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,950
It's from prison.
When the guys are in prison,

426
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:10,050
they got no belts because they don't 
want to commit suicide.

427
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,120
So everyone's sagging their pants.
So when they get out,

428
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:14,310
they used to doing that.
It's like an ex con thing.

429
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,770
Something cool about it.
Well,

430
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,040
somehow or another it became a rockstar 
thing and like you meet guys that are in

431
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:25,041
bands and they're sagging their pants,
they have their pants buckled up over 

432
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,041
there.
I'm like,

433
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,830
what the fuck are you doing?
Are you a gangster?

434
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,350
Are you a basketball shorts underneath?

435
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,140
What is that about?
What is that?

436
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:33,810
That is a weird.
It's horrible.

437
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,870
And then how about.
And then there's kids with the skinny 

438
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,870
jeans,
the practical jeggings,

439
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,861
and they're say like,
there's like a little weird urge to 

440
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:46,200
pants those guy in headbutt them when 
you see a dude with the pants,

441
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:49,800
like really just below their dick,
like this is just,

442
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,210
you're crazy.
You're sprinting and watch me follow 

443
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,090
themselves,
walking around amongst people and you 

444
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,030
basically look like a slob.
You basically handcuffing yourself and 

445
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,051
you're allowing people to close the 
handcuffs like you've got this little 

446
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:08,721
thing on.
You can just say we're just pants you 

447
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:08,721
and push you over.
Like,

448
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:09,580
this is ridiculous.
This is the dumbest thing.

449
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,780
You can be retarded.
What kind of man?

450
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:16,781
What kind of.
What does that say about our society 

451
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:16,781
that people,
for whatever reason,

452
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:16,781
this is how they choose to leave the 
house.

453
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:21,651
They want to buckle their pants above 
their cock and have their underwear 

454
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:22,640
hanging above it.
What?

455
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,940
No,
that's what you do.

456
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,530
Yeah,
man,

457
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,480
it's dope.
I'm sagging like that doesn't even.

458
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,870
That's got to be some sort of a.
it's an aberration,

459
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:31,510
like some sort of a.

460
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,870
you'd think so,
but it just continues to exist and 

461
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,730
perpetrate and it just still continue to
be.

462
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,230
I see people like that all the time.
I see guys where they buy the jeans.

463
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,000
Sag.
I'm so much that.

464
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:49,001
And then where the long shirt that it.
It looks like crazy legs or your knees 

465
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,380
are two feet long.
That doesn't make any sense.

466
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:52,130
I mean,
you know what?

467
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:57,131
I'm not here to talk about fashion for 
the most part in terms of like why 

468
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:57,750
didn't mean that in general we want to 
talk about fashion.

469
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:03,090
A politician.
I'm not here to talk about Fascia and my

470
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,990
opponent was talking about fashion.
I want us to tax you for skinny jeans.

471
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah.
Taxi for being a Douche bag is your belt

472
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,860
buckle below your Dick.
You're a fucking idiot.

473
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,930
Okay.
Is Your Dick Above your belt?

474
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:18,790
Buckle.
You Sir are an asshole.

475
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:24,030
You need to put your fucking pants off.
You can't possibly be contributing to 

476
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,241
society.
How old does that make you feel to have 

477
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:27,241
that very old,
that rant.

478
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:27,690
Not just old,
but a confused like,

479
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,720
this is not something has happened.
I think

480
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,360
we've lived through arrows and are 
familiar with,

481
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,180
with evolutions of fashion as it is and 
just we've seen,

482
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,820
yeah,
not nearly as preposterous.

483
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,450
No,
no,

484
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:47,451
they're not.
And yet and not nearly as offensive 

485
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,970
either.
So we started off on from [inaudible] 

486
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,211
77,
so I remember when bell bottoms are 

487
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:53,370
still kind of hanging around and fucking
mork and mindy vest,

488
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:56,810
but like the multicolor them goofy shit.
Right.

489
00:20:56,811 --> 00:21:00,130
And the bowl haircuts but then going 
into the eighties and they're like the,

490
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:05,131
the,
the abstract hairs and the all the 

491
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:05,131
different.
And there was like the,

492
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:08,290
all the androgynous shit.
There was the super tight stuff.

493
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,970
There was a really colorful stuff.
There's like everything.

494
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,710
The girls that look like Nagel 
paintings.

495
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Okay.
I seen all that and then you go to the 

496
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,961
nineties and then it just got okay.
Sagging pants and like weird odd colors 

497
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,340
and shoulder pads and whatever.
And then the 2000 and then you start.

498
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,560
Now we start combining fashion stuff 
from,

499
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,090
from classic era's and Amin all sorts of
stuff is making all kinds of comebacks.

500
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:33,400
So you're seeing looks from all over the
place everywhere.

501
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,750
Every day,
even right now,

502
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,770
that is the word,
the sagging jeans just that is the.

503
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,500
I just can't get.
I mean

504
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,390
that's the bottom.
That's the least understandable rockstar

505
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,530
on

506
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,660
stage and you're sagging your jeans a 
little bit and you're looking like 

507
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,050
particular you're deliberately trying to
look like,

508
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,050
like you're a,
like a pile of shit,

509
00:21:56,051 --> 00:22:01,051
like some sort of thrown together.
Just just sloppy son of a bitch on 

510
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:02,470
purpose.
Yes.

511
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,180
Got It.
To a degree when you were like a size 30

512
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:12,420
waist and you've got 40 genes on and 
they're just piled around your ankles 

513
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,760
and just what the fuck are you thinking 
of buying like quadruplex shirts that 

514
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,360
hang down past your knees,
you know who wears shirts that are so 

515
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,301
big that it covers their whole body.
Women do when they sleep at night and 

516
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:29,590
I'm not pregnant yet or when they're 
pregnant,

517
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:34,591
they were that.
Or girls wear that when you're like 14 

518
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:34,591
your 90 shirt.
Sure.

519
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:35,980
Silly Bitch.
Someone's got to pants you.

520
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Someone's got pants.
You push you over and pull your shirt 

521
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,970
over the top of your face and then give 
you nuggets.

522
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,680
It's ridiculous.
Look,

523
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,010
and I can't believe it's still around,
it doesn't make sense and I think it has

524
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:53,011
something to do with the fact that we're
not fulfilling our hunter gatherer 

525
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:55,890
jeans.
A hunter gatherer genes are being 

526
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:55,890
ignored.
100 genes,

527
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,880
$100 jeans are sagging our warrior 
genes.

528
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,910
They're not being fulfilled,
so we have all these genetic impulses 

529
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,070
that are all suppressed and so what do 
people do?

530
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,570
What goes off in aberrations and some.
Some aberrations are like sagging jeans.

531
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,480
They do stupid shit because they know 
that they're not.

532
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:14,481
They don't have to work.
If you were out in fucking Alaska and 

533
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:14,481
you were running away from bears all 
day,

534
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:16,340
you would have your belt buckles cinched
in,

535
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,580
have your fucking boots tied,
walk outside the door and you would the 

536
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:22,420
fuck is that.

537
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,100
You wouldn't be like,
yeah man,

538
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:26,980
you no longer taking cops to put my 
pants sagging.

539
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,320
Do they're medicating themselves on 
purpose,

540
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,160
leaving medical,
leaving their house dulled.

541
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,710
Why?
Because they're thumbing their fingers.

542
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,520
That given the finger to nature,
right?

543
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,530
You're saying it's so safe.
I can go out with my fucking lap belt 

544
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,320
tightening to think of new ways to be an
asshole because I don't have anything to

545
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:48,140
worry about it anymore dated,
going outside,

546
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,520
not worried about sleeping on a park 
bench,

547
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:57,521
you know,
worried about animals coming up and 

548
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:57,521
eating,
you know,

549
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:57,521
animals out here,
the pigeons,

550
00:23:57,521 --> 00:24:01,751
that's it.
You're going to worry about shit and 

551
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:01,751
they're not doing a damn thing with God.
Dammit.

552
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:03,120
We thumbed our nose and the face of 
evolution,

553
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:05,520
and this is the.
This is the system we found.

554
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,650
Yeah,

555
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,190
the,
the,

556
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:08,980
the easier things get,
the weaker we become,

557
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:13,220
the more we started looking for new and 
other ways to try and express that which

558
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:18,221
is not be used at all and not that I'm 
saying everybody needs to go out and 

559
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:19,420
start getting a fistfight,
drinking whiskey and,

560
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,060
and being fucking heavy metal bat.
I like myself,

561
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,730
but do something.
Do something difficult.

562
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,160
So your character,
anything difficult,

563
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,780
anything like to start by let's say 
maybe want using definite,

564
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,470
definite a definite words.
When you speak,

565
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,500
stop saying like kind of sort of.
I sat there and listened to a cable 

566
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,410
guide connecting my myself saying,
well you kind of do this,

567
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:46,100
and it's like that,
and it's,

568
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,730
what do you mean?
It's kind of in like you fucking hit the

569
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:53,731
enter button and it absolutely 
positively chooses set thing that you 

570
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,400
fucking put the cursor on this not kind 
of,

571
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,720
it's not sort of,
it's like it's a filler.

572
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,390
It's,
it's,

573
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,600
it's another,
but now it's come in,

574
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,780
you don't want to commit to anything.
Nobody wants to deliberately say I'm 

575
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,730
going to be there at this time and I'm 
going to fucking be.

576
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:13,140
There was a kind of maybe,
you know,

577
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:18,141
no one ever wants to also be deliberate 
in their speech because what they say 

578
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,170
I'm going to go.
And I,

579
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,180
I think that uh,
that black is the new gray and then 

580
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:26,080
someone goes,
what?

581
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:26,800
No,
no.

582
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:28,900
And they disagree because you made a 
definite statement.

583
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:31,060
You took a stand,
you made yourself,

584
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,260
you know,
and I think black is the new.

585
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:33,850
Great,
fuck you.

586
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,470
If you think differently,
fine,

587
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:37,150
we're going to get into an argument 
about it.

588
00:25:37,151 --> 00:25:38,920
I might run you over with my fucking 
car,

589
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,630
whatever,
but this is how I feel about it.

590
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,570
If you say I kind of thing that I get to
name,

591
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,400
it gives you that wiggle room that you 
can fucking slinkier way out.

592
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,330
You can use your greased up and slide it
under the door kind of.

593
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,420
And I fall.
It's such a common part of speech at 

594
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,450
this point that even I find myself 
saying like,

595
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:01,930
and kind of here and there,
but I can't stand it.

596
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,040
I hate when I catch myself saying like,
I'm not,

597
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,180
I'm not,
I'm not all about the like either,

598
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,690
but you know,
kind of this sort of that and no,

599
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,900
it isn't kind of or sorta anything.
Lots of shit in this world is not Kinda 

600
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:15,970
sorta.
It just is.

601
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,060
So you can't,
you can't get away from that.

602
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:21,400
Just fucking deal with it.
So uh,

603
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,720
you know,
that's just a huge pet peeve of mine 

604
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:26,720
dealing with people on a regular basis 
because it's,

605
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,100
it's so much easier for someone to think
of things.

606
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,770
Always have the ability to excuse 
themselves from it.

607
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:38,130
So that way they don't ever have to take
the brunt of the responsibility either 

608
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:38,170
way,

609
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,560
reason for not liking that and other 
people's that you would hate to see ever

610
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,160
in yourself.

611
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,290
It's an.
It's a weakness we've all been seeing.

612
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:46,960
Yeah,
well done.

613
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:48,940
Those things are all done.
Bullshit.

614
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,700
Stuff like that.
I think the difference being is when you

615
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:53,230
realize that that was bullshit.

616
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,010
Yeah.
You learned.

617
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,390
Yeah.
And some people aren't learning some and

618
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,790
that's,
that's where they need to.

619
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,650
Someone needs to kick him in the ass.
Somebody needs to say,

620
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,540
listen,
you got to catch the fuck up.

621
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,990
Right?
You learn from your mistakes and then 

622
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,540
improve and move on.
It's not just a continual cycle of 

623
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,750
failing and trying to get back on the 
horse and failing.

624
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,580
It's learned how to ride a fucking 
horse.

625
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,620
Okay?
It's not how many times you fall off the

626
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:17,210
horse.
Don't fall off the fucking horse again.

627
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:18,950
Stupid.
Train the Horse,

628
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:23,951
right?
Ride the horse right and don't fall off 

629
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:25,961
the horse.
You could be Christopher if you keep 

630
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:25,961
falling off horses,
especially if you want to get a horse to

631
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,460
jump over some shit that he doesn't want
to jump over.

632
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,570
I will never understand that

633
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,710
and it's.
You know what?

634
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:35,460
It is a lot to say that you could master
an animal like that,

635
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:40,010
but it is a massive fucking animal and 
when he doesn't want to do what it wants

636
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:40,930
to do,
like how are you?

637
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,630
How do you think it's great that we can 
use our intellect to control this thing,

638
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:46,910
but when it came down to the physical 
aspects,

639
00:27:46,911 --> 00:27:49,550
like you can't make a fucking horse do 
what it doesn't want to know.

640
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,780
Pullover shifts.
One thing,

641
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:55,781
if you run a trail horse,
you want the horse to ride on the trail 

642
00:27:55,781 --> 00:27:58,730
horse with a 200 pound man on his back.
It's really not that big a deal for a 

643
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,650
horse and they can safely walk.
But you want a horse to jump over shit.

644
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,680
You want it to fly through the air with 
a person the back.

645
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,130
Okay.
You fucking crazy.

646
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,040
What?
What's what?

647
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,190
What if you ever tried?
There's a lot of other shit,

648
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,580
you know,

649
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,130
fucking take a martial arts class,
learned how to drive a race car and race

650
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:17,550
cars are great.
They have breaks there.

651
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:22,770
They're fantastic.
They learn how to steer the very 

652
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:22,770
predictable.
It's not a fucking animal.

653
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,850
Some crazy might of its own.
It just wants to jump for whatever 

654
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:27,990
reason,
wants to fuck you back.

655
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,690
He lands on you and crushes your scholar
rock.

656
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,790
How about that?
The rest of your life,

657
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:38,810
you've.
If you have a window the size of a 

658
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,341
quarter that you could see the world out
of and you're fucking shitting your 

659
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:41,341
pants.

660
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:41,990
That's not anything that I'm interested 
to.

661
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,750
This is what I shoot all horses on site.
Have you ever had some of those Alistair

662
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:46,780
overeem?
More steaks?

663
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,190
No.
No,

664
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:49,690
no.
I haven't worked my way up.

665
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,880
I'm more of a goat.
Dick Guy.

666
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,870
The whole heavy metal attitude.
A little spicier.

667
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:58,240
It's supposed to be really a delicious.
Actually I have had horse meat into then

668
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,290
at Bra.
Did you like.

669
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,690
Oh really do wrong.
Yeah.

670
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:03,360
It's like a horse that she needs like a 
delicacy over there,

671
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:06,210
especially in like tissue in the more 
southern prefectures,

672
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,380
but I just,
it doesn't.

673
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:08,940
Uh,
I didn't dig it.

674
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,910
Alright.
And then what does Johnston?

675
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,980
I'm a is,
it kind of gave me kind of Gamey.

676
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,570
It's,
I couldn't really.

677
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,680
I'd be like sort of a taste maybe closer
to that.

678
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,240
Uh,
but I like Venice,

679
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,550
love Venice.
Uh,

680
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,470
it's just,
it's a little

681
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,790
man.
I'm amazed how hard it is to get 

682
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:33,790
venison.
You would think like really like.

683
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,621
Yeah.
You think like these are fucking pretty 

684
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:37,621
prevalent animals.
Why is it someone breeding them?

685
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:38,230
Like around here,
you know,

686
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:38,620
I mean

687
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,600
somewhere in the valley or something.
That big fucking field of because thing,

688
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,120
it's worth a shit.
Was hard enough to get to get assholes 

689
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,631
in Hollywood as it is.
And then then you go ahead and then you 

690
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:52,510
want to deliver something like,
okay,

691
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:54,190
they're gonna eat cow.
They'll eat chicken.

692
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,880
Definitely fish.
I was just making fun of somebody in the

693
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,770
day.
Where do you want to to Sushi?

694
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,020
Oh,
of course you want to go to such a let's

695
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,260
get a Sushi.
I love Sushi.

696
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,250
I'm like,
God,

697
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,640
give me some like,
oh,

698
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,940
have you ever been to a Sushi 
restaurant?

699
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,360
Like what the fuck?
Why does every woman in la?

700
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:13,060
Why don't eat fucking raw fish?
Why do you think that is?

701
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,290
Because it's what other,
what they think every other woman in La.

702
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,920
Those really.
Yes.

703
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,910
I thought it was because it was now me.
It's good,

704
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:24,970
but it's not like fuck,
let's go eat Sushi.

705
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Like fuck that.
Like you don't wake up one day and just 

706
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,640
think,
okay,

707
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:35,641
I might use to want fish.
I just want to say yes to everything 

708
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:37,410
man.
So I,

709
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:39,960
I forced me and it was all right.
But uh,

710
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,410
um,

711
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:48,310
what do you even like the other one 
thing he like almost above everything 

712
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,850
else during your,
in your diet or you'd be fairly clean,

713
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,970
like nutrition minded or flavor?

714
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,440
Uh,
try to be both.

715
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:00,720
I mean,
I do really enjoy the red meat hamburger

716
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:05,721
or steak or you can do a lot.
It's pretty personal too with that,

717
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,450
right?
Yeah.

718
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,630
So most satisfying food.
But one thing is,

719
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:10,800
okay,
there's that,

720
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:15,280
or if I just had some serious piece of 
ass,

721
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,390
the very next thing I want to hand to 
the next thing I want is a fucking him 

722
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:21,570
I've,
I've left.

723
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,900
I've left departments at odd hours of 
the night just tracking down any 24 hour

724
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,590
Carl's Jr and Jack in the box because I 
need a fucking hamburger immediately.

725
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,720
I'm done with the late night hamburgers.
I switched over,

726
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:42,720
I try to use,
I tried to eat some chicken sandwiches.

727
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:45,000
I'll eat like a carl's jr chicken 
sandwich or something like that.

728
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:50,001
But the progress,
it's either in and out or Wendy's and 

729
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:50,001
the other tapping out.
I can't.

730
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:50,840
I can't do Mcdonald's burgers too.

731
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,900
I don't,
I don't almost.

732
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,510
I almost never eat any of that crap.
I'll be honest.

733
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,580
Like I,
if I'm going to have a burger,

734
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:02,581
there's plenty of places I could go that
I know that meat is a lot healthier and 

735
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:07,650
I understand also the idea of keeping 
costs at those so far overboard in terms

736
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:11,680
of what corporations is people try to do
to save a buck.

737
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,590
Basically you through all integrity out 
the window,

738
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:16,510
so I can't support them

739
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,660
that.
What is that?

740
00:32:17,661 --> 00:32:22,661
That's not even a burger.
You've seen those pictures where they 

741
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:24,731
could take a Mcdonald's burger and then 
they track it for six months and it 

742
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:24,731
doesn't rot,
which just sits there.

743
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:28,310
I heard I did read about that because my
buddy did the same thing in his gym,

744
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,670
a crossfit breath.
He took the Bergens,

745
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,310
left it there and it didn't.
And then I read something about,

746
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:36,080
well,
it's got so much salt in it,

747
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,920
so it's more of a salt thing.
Really.

748
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,840
They said the weirdest thing about it 
isn't really the Burger.

749
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,960
It's thought that thing,
not molding.

750
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:50,290
That's where that's the most fucked up 
part of the whole thing and you should 

751
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,720
really be the most worried about putting
that in your mouth.

752
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,010
Really that phrasing,
I figured that a piece of bread,

753
00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:00,110
I mean you can,
you can salt meat to a degree that you 

754
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,200
know,
that it keeps for a long time.

755
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:05,201
They've been doing that forever,
but I mean long before we had 

756
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:06,280
refrigeration,
all meat with salt and pretty much so.

757
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,760
And you can make it into Jerky,
that bond,

758
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,420
we don't really write.
It doesn't have that kind of shelf life.

759
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,640
What is the effort,
what are they putting in there?

760
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,740
So insane preservatives,
I don't know,

761
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:23,770
something,
something totally Ireland that you 

762
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:23,770
really probably shouldn't be putting in 
your body.

763
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:28,130
It's amazing.
But in order to feed the amount of the 

764
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:28,130
amount of people that we have packed in 
the cities,

765
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,370
like you just drove here from Orange 
County,

766
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,720
think of that crazy drive which is one 
of the worst drives in the country as 

767
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,181
far as population centers.
I mean that is an enormous amount of 

768
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:38,181
people from the four.
Oh,

769
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:40,040
five for the five.
That whole area is,

770
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,290
that's an incredible amount of pain 
you're going through

771
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,170
through all these different demographics
the whole way.

772
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,410
And the only food.
Everybody needs food.

773
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,440
I think that there is a.
I'm like,

774
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:51,820
okay,
Penn and teller,

775
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:56,821
I love watching of filler bullshit.
And they had their whole thing on 

776
00:33:56,821 --> 00:33:57,570
organic food and about how uh,
you know,

777
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:02,850
the various chemicals also determined 
whether it's something can be called 

778
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,941
organic or not,
but then some certified or things that 

779
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:09,901
can be considered organic in terms of 
pesticides are actually worse than that 

780
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:09,901
than the things that they've created 
since then.

781
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:14,760
Well fine,
but it's that fine line where if you 

782
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,840
like,
you can take it to this point.

783
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,610
Okay.
To a degree.

784
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,650
But people take it that,
you know,

785
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:25,070
they want to save that extra thirty 
cents on the dollar while,

786
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:30,090
or three cents on the dollar and cent on
the dollar and pink slime.

787
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,420
That should just never be.
It should just never be excellent.

788
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:33,870
Yeah.
That,

789
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:38,871
that,
that pace that they throw into the 

790
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:38,871
burgers.

791
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:38,871
Oh yeah.
Normally,

792
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:43,510
yeah.
Like all the really gnarly treated with 

793
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,780
like ammonia see you kill all the 
bacteria that's in it.

794
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:49,160
It's like the idea that that's a burger.
It's ridiculous that in a burger.

795
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,740
Have you seen,
what would they do to fast food burgers?

796
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,840
The fillers and all the different things
they have.

797
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,450
I love,
Oh fuck out.

798
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,540
Or I'll have a three by three.
Would you like five guys?

799
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,580
Five guys.
Five guys?

800
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Pretty fucking good.
I might like that better than out on 

801
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:09,600
your button.

802
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,910
Yeah,
my buddy was going in and out.

803
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:13,330
It's better.
I think I will say that there

804
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,160
equal,
equal,

805
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,320
pretty fucking bad ass.
Can we just say separate?

806
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,110
Different.
Separate but separate sequel.

807
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,720
They're equally delicious

808
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,910
in a different way.
I'm a big fan.

809
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:32,911
I'm A.
I'm really on a hunt to find the best 

810
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:35,430
ultimate cheeseburger you can get 
anywhere and a mommy's definitely got a 

811
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,181
great one.
Father's office was fantastic and I'll 

812
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:39,400
the whatever you know the 12 bucks on a 
hammer

813
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,710
in Atlanta called the laughing skull and
they got some cheeseburger place,

814
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,220
apartment.
That is God.

815
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,800
I can't remember if you remember that 
place.

816
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:52,380
Brian.
The laughing skull plus the cheeseburger

817
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:54,270
place.
Hadn't remember.

818
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,380
Torsions fusion.
Fusion,

819
00:35:56,381 --> 00:35:57,990
I think.
I don't remember.

820
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,760
Whatever it is.
If you're in Atlanta,

821
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:04,761
it's above the laughing,
so it's the fucking greatest 

822
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:04,761
cheeseburger place on the face of the 
earth.

823
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:09,040
He had like all great buffalo burgers 
with blue cheese and just gore may slam 

824
00:36:11,091 --> 00:36:14,450
and cheeseburgers.
Real meat cooked the way you want.

825
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:16,050
You want it rather than giving you a 
rare.

826
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,010
You want a medium,
right?

827
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:17,090
Right.

828
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,900
Trust,
trusted.

829
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:18,930
It's like,
oh,

830
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,960
it was so awesome.
There's a place in Chicago I got to get 

831
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,281
to.
It's all heavy metal theme called 

832
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:28,020
coolest corner.
Have a slayer burger or go burger later.

833
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,110
The minute listen,
a good horror burger.

834
00:36:30,111 --> 00:36:32,220
It was.
It was like a.

835
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:37,300
It was like a lamb patty or something 
with ground beef sirloin and these are 

836
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,850
like gourmet,
like pretzel rolls a with goat cheese on

837
00:36:40,851 --> 00:36:45,851
top.
I mean to to to put like the layer that 

838
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:50,130
entire one has these,
these sauteed a pear slices that have 

839
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:53,170
been thrown on top of Gorgonzola and all
this,

840
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,220
I mean just damp and you have dirty 
metal heads in there listening to know 

841
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,460
immortal and then they're just counting 
the greatest burgers.

842
00:37:04,461 --> 00:37:05,910
Never known world.
Well,

843
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,260
weird combination and the Jews like in a
death metal and exquisite gourmet 

844
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,160
burgers.
Yeah.

845
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,250
That's so rare.

846
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,800
Exactly.
Why not go there?

847
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,500
How did you become a big death metal 
head?

848
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,260
Started off just getting into metal from
the classic rock side of things and my 

849
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:29,271
dad used to play guitar and just for fun
like Blues and Classic Rock and grew up 

850
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:33,441
listening to Sabbath and led Zeppelin 
and the Beatles and what have you.

851
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:38,691
And then I found like this kid that was 
the son of where my babysitter,

852
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,920
he was in,
he introduced me basically to I made.

853
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,740
And that was like,
oh fuck yeah,

854
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:50,030
of course at like six years old seeing 
Eddie.

855
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,150
The mascot was the coolest thing ever.
Like seen iron gate.

856
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,720
It's like a monster look in Zombie 
thing.

857
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,980
They call him Eddie.
And I remember he had this killer's 

858
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,250
shirt for the new album killers and 
Scott and he's like holding like some 

859
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,610
limp woman in his hand with like a 
bloody hatchet in the other spot that is

860
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,980
so bad ass.

861
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,420
And then I remember like,
and then from there with like metallica 

862
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,350
and slayer and negative and anthrax and,
and uh,

863
00:38:21,351 --> 00:38:25,070
and then that progressed to,
I remember hearing simple Hoorah.

864
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,130
And that was harder and heavier.
And then I found this pan bolt thrower 

865
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,310
and I'm like,
what the fuck is that?

866
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:37,311
The covers are so amazing and they're 
from these games like whammer 40 k 

867
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:37,311
stuff,
something like that.

868
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,970
I already liked that.
So let me check this out.

869
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,980
Oh God.
This is the heaviest,

870
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:45,410
most crushing music I've ever heard.
It sounds like.

871
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:51,270
It sounds like.
Sounds like an entire army of guitars 

872
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,380
coming up over the top of a ridge.
And then all fisk fucking you all at 

873
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,380
once.

874
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:01,590
Pretty much on Marshall amps.
Dropped out of the sky continuously on 

875
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,821
top of yours.
Raining on you being written by like 

876
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:05,960
trolls.
Is that the kind of Shit you listened to

877
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:09,230
you in your car?
Blew my tire out though.

878
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:11,350
I'm playing the music.
Oh it didn't?

879
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,230
No,
he didn't know what you said.

880
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,810
You listen to them when you work out.
I listened to it all the time,

881
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:21,811
but it's.
It really depends on my mood so I can 

882
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:22,120
listen to.
The only thing that I'll have on my ipod

883
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,370
is country music.
Really?

884
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,710
I can't get with country music.
You'd ever heard you?

885
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,370
No.
Reagan.

886
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,550
Bob Marley.
I could probably buy one reg,

887
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:35,551
a compilation album and have all the 
essentials for any reggae song ever 

888
00:39:35,551 --> 00:39:36,180
created ever.
And I'm okay with this.

889
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,840
Like 10 really good ones.
Right?

890
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,750
Would you be loved?
That's a great gym.

891
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,380
Yes.
That's a great jam.

892
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,720
Stand out to you

893
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,160
that get up.
Stand up.

894
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,080
Yeah,
but it gets a little repetitive

895
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,020
and I,
you know,

896
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:51,290
I've heard it said like,
okay,

897
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,070
got it.
Got It.

898
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,930
All right.
Now what are you seeing about today?

899
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,880
I and I.
What?

900
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,580
All right,
cool.

901
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:00,630
Yeah,
but at least it's better than Hawaiian 

902
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,581
music.
Hawaiian.

903
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,940
They're very proud people and I would 
understand if you got offended and when 

904
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,920
I go to Hawaii next time when people are
pissing me,

905
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,660
but the reality is you're there.
You had a perfect rock,

906
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,990
new orleans,
the perfect climate and the most 

907
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,370
beautiful place in the world,
and you're playing a song like the red 

908
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,680
and green button will all this shit you 
can be playing right now.

909
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,690
You could be playing a whole lot of 
love.

910
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,620
You can be playing led Zeppelin.
Okay?

911
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,120
You guys can have acd,
skinner,

912
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,170
you.
You'd be playing some real fucking 

913
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,170
music.
This is ridiculous.

914
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:48,470
How has this not been changed by the 
introduction of a song?

915
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,360
That song go that song?
She can.

916
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,930
It sounds ridiculous.
Uh,

917
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,890
all the great songs,
but it's like,

918
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:58,180
well,
I island things,

919
00:40:58,181 --> 00:40:59,910
you know?
Yeah.

920
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Oh,
Jesus always cracked me up is as you 

921
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,910
look like a magazine and her flying to 
Hawaii for the first time,

922
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:12,180
it will fight super raw 13 and I'm 
looking through the inflight magazine 

923
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,690
and it's got a little section for all 
the music and felt like,

924
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:14,430
oh,
here's the look,

925
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:19,470
you know,
channel four locals and you look and 

926
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,880
there was like this gnarly big jacked up
to,

927
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,590
to the big handlebar,
the gnarly biker mustache or whatever.

928
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:28,930
It's like food for Luther is his name 
and spelling.

929
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,560
You listened to his music.
The sweetest boys ever.

930
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:33,940
I've been

931
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,830
blowjobs or like right in the morning 
with Strawberry Syrup,

932
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,160
all I'm just tripping shoulders.
He does a,

933
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,560
pulls them out of socket because he's 
like 470 pounds,

934
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,590
eight feet tall and used to play for the
NFL.

935
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:01,060
It's just bad music for the greatest 
place on earth warrior culture to chill 

936
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:05,520
music.
It's all good.

937
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,940
That killed those red and green bananas.
Shit.

938
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,920
Take five minutes while resting scares 
me about the fucking hilarious though.

939
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,060
Oh,
that would be cool.

940
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:28,080
Maybe it's the navy.
It was a strategy to keep people from 

941
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,940
moving to Hawaii.
Just keep putting that shit in music and

942
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:34,210
I get tired of this music because if you
were like on the beach and they're like 

943
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,650
the best bands in the country all were 
in Hawaii.

944
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,910
You're like,
why don't we live in

945
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,300
cool.

946
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,570
That's awesome.
And the dirty upset,

947
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:49,571
right?
You spend a lot of time on why a lot of 

948
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:49,571
people get upset.

949
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:52,050
They're not happy about all of us.
How he's coming down there or actually 

950
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:52,050
really anybody from the mainland,
they're just like,

951
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:52,840
why don't you stay there

952
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,160
really?
Even if you're a Hawaiian blood from 

953
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,160
them.
Any live in the wetland.

954
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Yeah,
I can't.

955
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,060
I can't speak on that,
but as far as if you're just not 

956
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,140
Hawaiian,
she ever lived there?

957
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,180
No.
I spent time there and amazingly a why 

958
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,511
were great to me.
I Love Hawaiian island cultures at 

959
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:11,750
large.
I think part of it is because I'm from a

960
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,760
place like Seattle and I have some 
country roots to me in terms of like I 

961
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,320
grew up,
we'd go hunting and race cars and just 

962
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,140
all kinds of redneck.
He asked Shit in addition to any of this

963
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:27,141
high art bullshit that my mom got me 
sort of weaned on and love like modern 

964
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,080
architecture and culture and the 
classics and reading,

965
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,920
but I'm a fucking down there.
They're like,

966
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,420
oh no,
you're really down to earth who?

967
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:37,610
You're cool.
You're all right now.

968
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,460
You're,
you're cool.

969
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:40,710
You're a Allie.
The rest of those fuckers.

970
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:41,670
Well,
sure.

971
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:43,830
I mean if he,
he will see the average douchebag,

972
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,210
American tourists,
you know,

973
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,050
route.
I wouldn't.

974
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:51,430
Yeah.
I wouldn't want them to fucking crush 

975
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,430
reader.
Especially.

976
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,661
A lot of people who are emotional and 
fork and spoon was one of those Jersey 

977
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,280
Douche bags because you imagined most 
jersey shore type or housewives of 

978
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,490
Jersey type of Douche bags or you can 
even take the Jersey shore,

979
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,560
the west coast from Heineken.
One of those assholes around down there,

980
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,160
bro.
Bro.

981
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,550
Bro.
Bro.

982
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,070
Bro,

983
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,400
perfect.
That was a really good impression of one

984
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:19,401
of those asshole say bro.
17 times and every sentence you want me 

985
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:21,690
to show the fuck out,
get more tribal task.

986
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,520
We need to get those motherfuckers in 
the gym and then it get strangled and 

987
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,611
need to get humiliated.
They need to get down to earth like calm

988
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:31,980
the fuck down

989
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,190
and just be a little nicer taste.
So much more than that because so many 

990
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,620
guys,
especially on the west coast now,

991
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,620
the west coast,
each bag,

992
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,640
they go to the gym every now and again.
They definitely live.

993
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,890
You go there,
they go to plays or whatever they do.

994
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,520
They train,
train Joko to use

995
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,330
and they get in there and they never 
really fight a little bit.

996
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:01,350
Not Fighters.
They're just guys that had a couple of 

997
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:01,350
fights.
The big difference,

998
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:01,750
but

999
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,180
you're getting humbled and humiliated in
the gym

1000
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,610
because outside of the gym like,
well,

1001
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:12,750
that's a different place as a whole 
other that's a sort of country that only

1002
00:45:12,851 --> 00:45:15,460
exist there and then when I'm out in the
general populace,

1003
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,720
when I'm being an asshole on the streets
of of like main street and end and Pch,

1004
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,760
that's.
It's different.

1005
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,000
That's the big problem that there is a 
lot of those guys,

1006
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:30,580
right?
There isn't a Douche.

1007
00:45:30,581 --> 00:45:35,200
Bags are douchebags of average downer.
I've leveraged honoring every Douche bag

1008
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:40,201
has this has this thing.
You got your history Douche bag that 

1009
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:42,680
thinks they're so above you and there's 
culture and everything they say has so 

1010
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,480
much meaning behind it,
so much deeper.

1011
00:45:43,481 --> 00:45:44,680
It's like,
no,

1012
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,770
you're just as bullshit.
Anybody else?

1013
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:52,771
In fact,
more so because you don't even realize 

1014
00:45:52,771 --> 00:45:54,541
that they should.
You say it doesn't matter or you know 

1015
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:57,541
you've got.
You've got the MMA douche bag like runs 

1016
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,871
around wants me to make sure everybody 
knows that they train and that it can 

1017
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:03,940
fly and all that kind of bullshit and 
you've got your club each day.

1018
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:06,850
You've got bags of all sorts.
Not everybody takes it as money.

1019
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:09,050
Douche bags.
There's fitness Douche bags,

1020
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,700
just fitness to stretch your grade.
You can't even have a conversation about

1021
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:13,980
anything but their diet.
I mean,

1022
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:19,010
that's wonderful.
That's how I want to spend the next 30 

1023
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,591
minutes sitting at a table with someone 
that's talking about how many like 

1024
00:46:22,591 --> 00:46:23,100
grains of rice they can have and 
everything.

1025
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,690
And it's for like,
like a,

1026
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:25,890
a,

1027
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,430
it's competition.
Like what are you doing?

1028
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,150
Well,
it's like,

1029
00:46:29,151 --> 00:46:30,740
you know,
you sort of do a,

1030
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,100
you know,
different poses and you know,

1031
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:35,090
you do like maybe a little bit of 
gymnastics.

1032
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,540
Like cheerleader seems a lot like 
cheerleading,

1033
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:41,180
man.
What are you doing?

1034
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:46,181
A fitness competition with a megaphone,
you support the team.

1035
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:53,060
It's just ridiculous bodies.
But even with,

1036
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,550
if the minute they step off the stage 
like that,

1037
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:01,150
I've had an elegant or they.

1038
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,140
It's like,
hey,

1039
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:02,880
how you doing?
Hey,

1040
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,540
what's up?
Oh,

1041
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,090
you're a mom.
You're like,

1042
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,080
oh,
I don't know.

1043
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,670
I don't want to talk about,
you know,

1044
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,450
boneless chicken breast.
No,

1045
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,030
I,
you know what I'm here for.

1046
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,120
I've got somewhere to be,
but I'll be right back.

1047
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:21,121
Don't worry about that.
It didn't supersized in the morning 

1048
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:21,121
thinking about hills.
Fucking do it.

1049
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,420
I don't want to talk about it.
How was the.

1050
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,960
How could anybody consider that to be 
something interesting?

1051
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,010
Oh yeah.
We have that.

1052
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,940
We have an understanding and that I know
a secret that is

1053
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,070
it for entertainment.

1054
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,830
Never understood.
People that are into like I can 

1055
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,111
understand wanting to be in shape,
but I can understand like crossfit 

1056
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:42,111
competitions and stuff like that

1057
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:47,070
to be the best in the world of working 
out and be the best in the world at 

1058
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:47,070
doing cleans,
you know,

1059
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,680
Olympic.
No,

1060
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,500
no 100 cleans in a row with 50 pounds.
You know,

1061
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:57,270
like we need to know what's going on 
here for bodybuilding.

1062
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,540
So is like,
okay,

1063
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,210
hold on.
Everybody has a,

1064
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,640
you know,
they're using the way that they're going

1065
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:08,641
to live for a specific purpose.
Now I'll say I think bodybuilding is 

1066
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:11,321
pointless.
What's the point of putting all that 

1067
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:11,780
time and effort to look at it?
Just look a certain way.

1068
00:48:11,781 --> 00:48:14,810
I never use it.
And then you've got the crossfit,

1069
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:18,170
which is the same thing,
exact same thing,

1070
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:22,370
but just they're an actual better 
overall shape and you know,

1071
00:48:22,371 --> 00:48:27,371
they use it,
but they only use it for more working 

1072
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,291
out.
So we're basically just jerking off the 

1073
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,230
whole time.
That's all anybody is doing.

1074
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:32,710
They're just jerking themselves off and 
uh,

1075
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:33,380
you know,
okay,

1076
00:48:33,381 --> 00:48:38,090
well why don't you body build because 
you know,

1077
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:43,120
you to look better on screen or do power
lifting because you want to be stronger 

1078
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:48,131
and then do crossfit,
whatever workout for your anaerobic 

1079
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:52,610
endurance animal and all this.
And then like take it and then go play a

1080
00:48:52,611 --> 00:48:56,390
game.
Go play football with your friends or go

1081
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,480
hiking or climbing a mountain or 
grappling or something like that and 

1082
00:49:02,301 --> 00:49:05,690
then apply it into a skilled deal.
I saw this video where there was,

1083
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:10,950
it was the gist of it was these two nfl 
dues are boxers are very.

1084
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:16,090
Nfl guys are former NFL.
They just come from facts and they did 

1085
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,631
some prostitute workout,
some crossfit gym in La and they did an 

1086
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:23,981
x amount of time then.
And here's our crossfit guys that are 

1087
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:26,180
here all the time that the kids did it 
faster than the other guys.

1088
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:29,270
And I'm like,
but they can catch a fucking football.

1089
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,960
You can just run around with a little.
He's like an asshole.

1090
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,080
That's all you can do.
You can do 100 kipping pull ups.

1091
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,350
Great.
So a great.

1092
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,490
Well let's just stop you from no one.
You know what?

1093
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:44,570
100,000
people are not going to fall into a 

1094
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:44,570
stadium and pay millions of dollars for 
Washington.

1095
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,410
Pull ups are about someone trying to do 
something and someone else trying to 

1096
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:51,050
stop them from doing something.
So multifaceted.

1097
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,240
Sort of the competition when you're 
dealing a bunch of chips.

1098
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,620
No stopping you.
It says you have chefs and it's,

1099
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,990
it's kind of a weird halfway sport.
I'm going,

1100
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,570
I can see how it's athletic or conceal 
requires willpower and discipline.

1101
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,800
Amazing Shit.
And it's impressive when got incredible 

1102
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:09,800
shit.
But I would rather,

1103
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,960
I would rather learn a martial art.
I would rather learn how to play a game.

1104
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:15,810
I'd rather learn to do rather learn 
hockey anything.

1105
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:19,890
It's just kind of be more input.
There's more going on than just standing

1106
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,210
there doing cleans.

1107
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,270
I can't.
I don't get it either.

1108
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:30,271
I,
I think like that's the you do to make 

1109
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,100
you help you be better at the real thing
that you do.

1110
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,490
Yeah.
I was talking to.

1111
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:37,550
I slept competition,
competition in class.

1112
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,900
Take some intermural basketball.
We do something we were talking to play,

1113
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,760
go play a tournament.
Do crossfit,

1114
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,040
be in shape and Api the way these days 
shape and an API it don't,

1115
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,930
don't go run around the whole world 
about it.

1116
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,530
So like don't look at other somebody 
else and be like,

1117
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,880
well when I did that,
you know francine and I did Zelda.

1118
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,330
I did it 17 minutes and that's it.
I don't care.

1119
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,130
No name,
name,

1120
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:15,700
name,
name Tommy and rescue and Nikki's deck,

1121
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,270
like a righteous indignation when they 
order the green tea at starbucks.

1122
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,880
But that's.
I don't even.

1123
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,420
And I think the root,
all that kind of stuff isn't doing.

1124
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:31,700
Crossfit isn't doing any.
It couldn't be any.

1125
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:33,950
You could substitute crossfit with 
anything else.

1126
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,280
It's just something comes along.
It gets to a certain level where people 

1127
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,230
start jumping on it because one,
whether it's good or it's bad,

1128
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:47,231
it's something that's new and it's 
different and it and it and it is a 

1129
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:50,501
change from what the norm was,
so therefore everybody feels like 

1130
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:51,590
they're like they're improving who they 
are,

1131
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:56,591
they're they're growing and now they're 
a part of something that's more special 

1132
00:51:56,591 --> 00:52:00,730
and therefore then that by a group gets 
taken way out of context and then the 

1133
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:04,380
after effects of that are people 
becoming Douche bags

1134
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,570
mathematically,
Broadway,

1135
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,260
lot of Nice people and there's a lot of 
people that don't want to just go to the

1136
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:20,050
gym and lift weights and be bored,
so they take the shitty stuff.

1137
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,210
Of course there's good stuff

1138
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,410
not working out and staying healthy is 
awesome.

1139
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:30,040
I love that crossfit is as looked back 
to older,

1140
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:32,880
simpler ways of training and brought 
that to the,

1141
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,000
to the,
to the populace.

1142
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,470
I think that's great.
You know,

1143
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,710
strongman type stuff,
old schools,

1144
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,910
the old school thought processes of 
just,

1145
00:52:39,911 --> 00:52:41,620
you know,
grab heavy shit and lifted,

1146
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:47,020
but you know,
there's a lot of flawed reasoning in my 

1147
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:47,020
opinion.
Behind some of that too,

1148
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,130
and also like I get so sick of it.
Oh I,

1149
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,480
you know,
I'm saying like a fighter,

1150
00:52:49,481 --> 00:52:50,410
like,
no you're not,

1151
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:55,670
you're not a fighter.
It's not the same trying to choke the 

1152
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:56,370
life out of you brain,
you know,

1153
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,780
and if you go to kickboxing class at 
night,

1154
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:01,090
that doesn't make you a fighter either.
Like fighters are fighters,

1155
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,010
people that do martial arts,
martial art,

1156
00:53:03,011 --> 00:53:03,700
martial art,
you know,

1157
00:53:03,701 --> 00:53:08,701
the train training is know what,
just be realistic and there's nothing 

1158
00:53:09,341 --> 00:53:09,820
wrong with that.

1159
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,160
If you're not going to be a fighter,
even though you've trained in martial 

1160
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:15,160
arts,
that's okay.

1161
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,670
People talk to me about coming and 
trying to jam or or whatever.

1162
00:53:18,671 --> 00:53:19,870
And I said,
you know what?

1163
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,400
Don't do it because you want to be a 
fighter.

1164
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:23,250
If you really want to be a fighter,
the fighter,

1165
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:24,180
not a fighter,
to,

1166
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,250
to,
to every level that you need to,

1167
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,470
which these,
you're probably never going to amount to

1168
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:32,310
anything with fighting because it's.
The odds are totally against you,

1169
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:37,690
but that's not the reason you do it.
Not Because of success that you think 

1170
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:40,701
are going to get from it.
You do it because you're driven and you 

1171
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:43,370
love it and you have to do it and that's
the only way that you can ever fully 

1172
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:45,630
realized that most of your potential.
More people are going to fail,

1173
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:50,631
then they're going to succeed,
but honestly if you are better when you 

1174
00:53:50,631 --> 00:53:54,651
end it and when you started and you 
don't have any regrets and you 

1175
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:57,320
absolutely succeeded,
you didn't get the metals you need to 

1176
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,391
get the money,
but you took you as you stood here today

1177
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:06,080
and became something better and more 
encompassing and have lived a life 

1178
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,890
experience because you decided to do 
something and do it like you mean it.

1179
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,140
And that's hard for people to wrap their
heads around that,

1180
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,030
you know,
I go into the gym,

1181
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:20,150
I just want to be better than when I 
step off of that than I was when I 

1182
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,540
stepped on it.
And some days aren't so great.

1183
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,950
Some days are amazing and I also have 
like this huge mean streak.

1184
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,890
I hate losing whatever,
but I also.

1185
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:32,040
And as much as that is always a part of 
who I am,

1186
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,190
uh,
I have to temper that and I have to look

1187
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:37,950
at all the data that comes from 
everything that I do when I'm in the gym

1188
00:54:37,951 --> 00:54:39,840
and then break it down and then be more 
effective.

1189
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:42,950
But I think that guy he used up,
do,

1190
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,430
you know,
I mean,

1191
00:54:44,431 --> 00:54:47,330
yeah,
in my head I'm thinking I'm going to jab

1192
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,640
the living shit out of that fucker until
his Dick Falls off.

1193
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,440
That's how much I'm going to jab that 
period.

1194
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:57,460
I'm going to jab in so many times and 
he's never been to want to get in the 

1195
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:57,460
ring with me ever again.
Ever.

1196
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,000
Period.
You think this is about training?

1197
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,400
Yes,
but I also have to sit back,

1198
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,110
but I'll go,
why was he able to Jab me?

1199
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,640
What did I do wrong?
But I do,

1200
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:08,010
right?
Why is this so effective?

1201
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:13,310
How do I take that and make it mine?
Or how do I analyze that and see the 

1202
00:55:13,681 --> 00:55:15,840
patterns before they become a problem 
for me,

1203
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:22,050
isn't it in the development of a martial
arts to see someone set an incredibly 

1204
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,400
high level and realize that that is 
where the market set

1205
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,740
can be the best at everything.
There's somebody out there,

1206
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:33,310
there's probably plenty of people out 
there that I can just annihilate and 

1207
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:38,081
uses the toothpick with their user bones
as tooth toothpicks when I'm done with 

1208
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:40,340
them,
chances are they're out of that group of

1209
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:45,341
people that I'm talking about therapy 
within that there's things that they do 

1210
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:48,140
better than I do that maybe that one 
thing or maybe a couple of things,

1211
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:53,141
but they're better at it by far so I 
could look at them and paste something 

1212
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:58,721
from.
It doesn't matter how much better of a 

1213
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:01,121
fighter I am.
There's so much to be to be seen or 

1214
00:56:01,121 --> 00:56:02,090
taken in.
There's a million ways that the body can

1215
00:56:02,091 --> 00:56:07,091
move and one way you know,
and I realized that there's some things 

1216
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:09,050
I'm never going to be great at because 
the physicality,

1217
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,060
physical limitations or injuries or 
whatever,

1218
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:16,210
it's just that's okay.
Like I'm never going to get with rubber 

1219
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:16,340
guard because my knees are too fucked 
up.

1220
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:22,190
What's wrong with you?
I have torn ligaments sent home and 

1221
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,371
they're just a mess.
This has been repaired on the right 

1222
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:28,261
before and it was just,
they won't take it if I pull on him 

1223
00:56:28,261 --> 00:56:28,370
through our like that,
it'll start.

1224
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,460
It was sent out to like lock master.
That's a man that's got to be kind of 

1225
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,130
tricky to be a dry with no injuries and 
be a guy.

1226
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:42,130
I just need a.
I just have a very good feel for it and 

1227
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:46,451
I know what I can get away with and I 
know a lot of like lost her ankle goes 

1228
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:50,921
before it needs to be.
Oh my ankles are not the greatest thing 

1229
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:50,921
either.
But um,

1230
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:54,560
he's just sort of understand what you're
dealing with and then go from there.

1231
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:59,620
But I have nonetheless,
since I know that I'm never going to be 

1232
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,940
someone that can affect it,
like be a good rubber guard guy.

1233
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,950
I pay attention because Shannon like to 
use those setups.

1234
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,350
So she's working on something.
I can go to her and go,

1235
00:57:09,351 --> 00:57:09,960
okay,
look at you,

1236
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,350
you know,
get angled like this because look at the

1237
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:17,351
way that,
that pushes your body weight and your 

1238
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:17,390
pressure against their joint there and 
this,

1239
00:57:17,391 --> 00:57:20,390
and this is where now you're creating a 
weakness in them at this angle,

1240
00:57:20,391 --> 00:57:23,600
so you can defeat that angle here.
Or Hey,

1241
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:26,240
this guy's really good rubber guard.
Now Watch how he's going to.

1242
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:31,450
He's going to try and get these angles 
and these positions on you because this 

1243
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:31,450
is where it's going to take you out of 
position.

1244
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:35,650
So this entire you're going to have to 
defeat them because fulcrums levers,

1245
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,730
it's all relative.

1246
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,570
If you work on your flexibility,
what I do,

1247
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,480
it's hard.
It's hard to get there.

1248
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:43,350
And I'm,
I'm older.

1249
00:57:43,351 --> 00:57:48,351
And how much of a fighter success do you
think is a timing issue?

1250
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,050
Like getting involved in a sport at the 
right age time?

1251
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:52,700
Good.
Excellent.

1252
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,720
Something.
How much of it is bulldog determination 

1253
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,320
and just your ability to learn from your
mistakes and despite the bad feelings,

1254
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,750
it's mental,
mental,

1255
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,020
mental aspect of it.
Uh,

1256
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,200
because that's kind of the mental aspect
is the thing that is going to not only 

1257
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,410
make you want to fight when you want to 
quit,

1258
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:18,660
but it'll also be a step back and 
realize that all these things,

1259
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:24,140
all these circumstances came about 
within these moments and how to take 

1260
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,460
them,
change them,

1261
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,500
understand them and make the appropriate
changes and additions crashes from your 

1262
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:35,930
game to be better.
You have to be analytical like that and 

1263
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,540
you have to remove emotion from that,
from those circumstances because when 

1264
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:41,370
she get emotionally attached and worked 
up about it,

1265
00:58:41,371 --> 00:58:46,371
then it will defeat your ability to be 
as useful as possible.

1266
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:47,580
And like,
I mean,

1267
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,370
especially in the case of a lot of 
people,

1268
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:55,550
most people are never going to be really
successful with fighting if they choose 

1269
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:55,600
that as their,
as their,

1270
00:58:55,601 --> 00:58:57,190
a pair occupation,
you know,

1271
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,330
it's not going to make the money for 
them to pay one.

1272
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,410
It's not,
but it shouldn't hurt somebody.

1273
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,850
They should just do it because they love
it.

1274
00:59:02,851 --> 00:59:06,520
I was watching a lecture by Alan,
depending,

1275
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,430
I think his name is,
and I'm like that on pessimism.

1276
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,440
The philosophical lecture on pessimism 
and about how one of the reasons why you

1277
00:59:13,441 --> 00:59:18,441
get so upset about things and you get so
worked up is because you have these 

1278
00:59:18,441 --> 00:59:19,320
expectations that things are always 
going gonna work out well,

1279
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:22,220
but if she put the reality of most,
don't work out at all.

1280
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:27,610
In fact,
there's almost always more failure than 

1281
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:27,610
there is success,
but you're so primed for success.

1282
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:32,300
You have to believe that this will 
always work in your favor and it's like 

1283
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,620
a traffic.
You know,

1284
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,160
you get so mad and angry and pissed off 
line and we only traffic,

1285
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,650
but the thing is is that there's always 
traffic.

1286
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:41,550
Traffic is the,
the,

1287
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,430
the not the exception.
It isn't the norm.

1288
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,740
So when you encounter it,
why is he so mad?

1289
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:51,040
It's always there and it always occurs,
so it's more unusual for there to be any

1290
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:56,381
traffic at all,
but we have this concept in our head 

1291
00:59:56,381 --> 00:59:57,650
that even getting behind the wheel and 
driving down the road,

1292
00:59:57,651 --> 01:00:02,651
it's all gonna work out for us instead 
of us having to waste just like every 

1293
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:03,500
other schmo because things are the way 
they are.

1294
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,720
Yeah,
that's a funny way of looking at it.

1295
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,380
Um,
we,

1296
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,520
we can't,
uh,

1297
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:13,710
one thing I can appreciate failure as a 
tool for success,

1298
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,420
you know,
because every time that I've ever,

1299
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,240
especially as a comedian,
one of the best,

1300
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,670
most motivating factors is bombing on 
stage.

1301
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,280
And when you,
when you eat a dick on stage,

1302
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:27,090
you never want that to happen again.
And you'll tighten everything up.

1303
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:29,400
You'll go over your material with a fine
tooth comb.

1304
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,160
Think about your delivery,
you listened to recordings.

1305
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:37,310
He don't want that feeling.
How long does it joke suck before it 

1306
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:37,920
becomes good?
You never know,

1307
01:00:37,921 --> 01:00:39,120
man.
You never know.

1308
01:00:39,121 --> 01:00:43,710
Sometimes you'll come up with a joke and
it's perfect the moment it comes up.

1309
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,610
And then other times it might take a,
a,

1310
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,670
a year for Joe to evolve.
And remember,

1311
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,270
I'm Louis Ck was telling me that Chris 
Rock,

1312
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,060
Chris rock has this one really 
controversial bit.

1313
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:54,970
He goes,
ah,

1314
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,930
I love black people.
I hate niggas you ever heard that bit?

1315
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,110
I don't think I have

1316
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,040
brilliant bit about,
uh,

1317
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:03,290
you know about it,
you know,

1318
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:05,500
the difference between a,
in his mind,

1319
01:01:05,501 --> 01:01:08,460
a black guy.
And a Nigga and um,

1320
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,270
it,
it took a long time to work.

1321
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,640
Apparently it took like a year.
It was bombing for a year.

1322
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:17,670
He would go on to an each,
couldn't get it to work and then it 

1323
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:20,071
became eventually became a closing bit.
It became a bit that it was just 

1324
01:01:20,071 --> 01:01:21,520
destroying perfect old school.
Classic bit.

1325
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,850
But it's one of those things where every
bit's got its own timeline.

1326
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,880
Every bit has its own shelf life to some
bits are timeless and some bits they're 

1327
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,880
only good.
They're a monster for six months.

1328
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:36,030
Maybe it's topical.
Maybe things change can make a joke 

1329
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,030
about vhs tapes anymore.
Nobody gives a shit thing.

1330
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,830
Time moves on,
you know.

1331
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,600
I mean,
I used to have a great joke about nextel

1332
01:01:40,601 --> 01:01:42,390
phones.
It was a fuck about next time.

1333
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:43,810
No,
it's uh,

1334
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,020
some of them will last for a long time 
and some of them don't.

1335
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,420
And some of them are done the moment you
say it,

1336
01:01:49,421 --> 01:01:50,260
the first time on stage,

1337
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,540
that's its lifespan.
It's funny.

1338
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:55,240
Only the first time hearing it.
Sure.

1339
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:55,670
Is it.

1340
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:59,250
There's some of that and there's some 
bits that are there are fully formed bit

1341
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,650
the moment out of your mouth and the 
last few years it's totally different,

1342
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:04,420
you know,
just uh,

1343
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:08,350
it completely depends on the subject,
depends on what you're trying to say,

1344
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,330
how,
how silly or complex it is.

1345
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,590
Usually the more common

1346
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:14,330
has I imagine also what bits led into 
that.

1347
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:15,130
Sure,
yeah.

1348
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:18,770
Bits go from exile and what not just 
jokes being said,

1349
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:23,771
but what tone is being set,
so all of a sudden you're going one 

1350
01:02:23,771 --> 01:02:23,771
direction.
You change gears.

1351
01:02:23,771 --> 01:02:25,110
Sometimes that immediacy hard stop,
changed,

1352
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:30,140
catches people off Guard and reserve any
and it makes them laugh or at least you 

1353
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:33,380
know,
it gets their mind spinning in a way 

1354
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,941
that sets up the next stuff.
Or sometimes it just confuses them and 

1355
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:36,140
flux the whole rest of the next,
you know,

1356
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:39,000
10 minutes of jokes up.
Just knowing that you can be a comedian,

1357
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:44,320
could easily be a community.
Just having this conversation and 

1358
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:44,320
knowing that I always tell people that 
you get,

1359
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,240
it's nothing.
It's not that complicated,

1360
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:46,820
but it's not easy.
A,

1361
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,900
it's a weird.
I've never been to,

1362
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:53,901
a comedian was a,
was sitting with a friend who was a 

1363
01:02:53,901 --> 01:02:55,510
comedian and they were going to go on 
and on.

1364
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,050
I'm just hanging in the pre show and 
we're all,

1365
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,000
a bunch of us were all just hanging out 
in the,

1366
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:03,000
uh,
in the Iowa and I'm just being the crack

1367
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:05,580
and stupid jokes and doing wordplay and 
whatever.

1368
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,200
Someone was like,
you know,

1369
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,160
you work in at night.
I'm like,

1370
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,900
I got a little boehner and I was like,
very little.

1371
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,730
And uh,
and I just thought,

1372
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:19,820
no,
I'm not a comedian at all where you 

1373
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:19,820
think I'm fucking,
I like that you can do it.

1374
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,060
It's not that complicated.
It's a,

1375
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,360
you know,
it's almost like a normal skill that 

1376
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,181
everyone sort of has a small form.
Most people at least try to have like 

1377
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,190
one or two things they could say that a 
witty in their life,

1378
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:37,420
you know,
it's just a matter of cultivating those 

1379
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:37,420
and becoming like a woody farmer.
And I say,

1380
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:38,880
how many people can keep their nerve too
though.

1381
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,470
It's a little of that.
Yeah.

1382
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:43,290
If I had to get on stage and deliver 
stand up,

1383
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:47,190
that would would freak me the fuck out 
would be more.

1384
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:51,780
That's more way more fearful than 
fighting even five guys all at one time,

1385
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:55,980
like that's okay by me,
but once you do it a couple times,

1386
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:57,090
it would be easy.
Dude.

1387
01:03:57,091 --> 01:04:02,091
I have been in some of these public 
speaking scenarios where people are so 

1388
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:02,091
great.
I go,

1389
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:03,870
I'm shitting myself.
So scary.

1390
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,650
It's crazy.
Shitting yourself.

1391
01:04:07,651 --> 01:04:09,150
It doesn't make any sense,
I guess.

1392
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:10,480
No real fear.
Exactly,

1393
01:04:10,481 --> 01:04:11,370
and that's,
that's,

1394
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,850
that's a hard thing to get past is that 
in my mind,

1395
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:19,260
I know that that all this fear is all 
self created.

1396
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:22,290
If everybody thought I was an idiot,
who cares?

1397
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,300
Right?
It only matters what I think.

1398
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:26,010
If I don't think I'm an idiot and I'm 
okay with it,

1399
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:28,550
then fuck you all like go,
go fucking.

1400
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,020
You can all burn.
I don't get that shit.

1401
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,660
Take a long time to get to the point of 
comfort filled.

1402
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:37,661
That is part of being a man and one of 
the most important parts of being a man 

1403
01:04:37,661 --> 01:04:38,460
is getting to a point where you 
genuinely,

1404
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:42,050
truly don't give a fuck if someone 
doesn't like what you like.

1405
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,560
It was like,
I know what I like.

1406
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,190
I don't give a fuck like that.
Very few people really don't.

1407
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:51,960
And even once we get to that point,
where is the one area?

1408
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,840
A couple areas I should say.
Well,

1409
01:04:53,841 --> 01:04:56,250
we make those exceptions obviously.
Yes.

1410
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:57,890
What else?
He breaks you.

1411
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:00,400
Policy Ruins the mind,
the brakes.

1412
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,690
Oh,
plus you just tragic.

1413
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:07,860
It can break a man.
Plus he was one of my song and listen to

1414
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:12,861
uh,
a from every time I died I got this 

1415
01:05:12,861 --> 01:05:12,861
great lyric.
It says,

1416
01:05:12,861 --> 01:05:12,861
uh,
it's uh,

1417
01:05:12,861 --> 01:05:17,230
it's not lack of ambition that keeps 
women not lack of ambition that keeps 

1418
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:17,950
good men bedridden.
It's true.

1419
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,710
Yeah.
I know dudes that it becomes a,

1420
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:24,520
it becomes such a massive part of their 
life that eclipses all else.

1421
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:29,590
I have a friend that I've,
I've seen him like glue do his fucking 

1422
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:32,630
phone and it's almost,
it should be integrated into his body.

1423
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:37,710
He is on it so much and yet it's 
constantly chattered little text here 

1424
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:38,990
there.
Oh well,

1425
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:41,600
you know an hour's gone by on this one,
so I need to resend a response there and

1426
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:46,601
just constant communication between 
women the whole time because that's the 

1427
01:05:47,271 --> 01:05:51,470
amount of effort it takes to to bang 
that much fucking tail.

1428
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:57,040
And I remember sitting there thinking,
I don't have the patience for this at 

1429
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,140
all.
Like it'll just get to a certain point.

1430
01:05:58,141 --> 01:05:59,780
Then if I deal with enough stupid shit,
I'm like,

1431
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:02,330
you're a fucking idiot.
Get off of my fucking phone.

1432
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,190
Who's my number?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

1433
01:06:04,191 --> 01:06:07,850
It's hard enough for me to even have a 
conversation with you with my thumbs,

1434
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:13,060
let alone have to think about the idea 
of putting aside a block of time to run 

1435
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:17,000
into you to work you up to the point of 
trying just to have sex with you.

1436
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:22,040
Oh yeah.
It gets to a weird point where some 

1437
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,030
people just want to chat all day.
What's up?

1438
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,970
Like you get a text like what's up?
Nothing.

1439
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,940
Some of you thinking of going to the 
gym.

1440
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,760
Fucking go fucking go,
cut.

1441
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,320
Tell me how it turns out.
I,

1442
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:41,330
you know,
that's what your facebook is for you to 

1443
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:41,330
tell me that you're going to go to the 
gym telling me that you,

1444
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,180
uh,
how,

1445
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:46,150
how good of a workout you had you to 
beat up with a face to face and go,

1446
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,120
listen,
time is very precious for me.

1447
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:49,800
My Vagina,
vagina,

1448
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:50,520
vagina,
vagina,

1449
01:06:50,521 --> 01:06:51,430
man.
It does it.

1450
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,760
So it takes a certain amount of.
And this is probably why I'm a single 

1451
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:56,850
man,
but uh,

1452
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:02,120
also.
But that's also why men try so hard to 

1453
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,421
be bad motherfuckers.
They try so hard to be bad 

1454
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:05,421
motherfuckers.
Partially.

1455
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,950
One of the reasons to dominate is to be 
more attractive to women.

1456
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:08,790
Yes,
natural.

1457
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:13,830
But I got to tell you,
the difference between being a real bad 

1458
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,330
motherfucker and being an outwardly,
seemingly bad motherfucker is night and 

1459
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:17,320
day.
If you're an outwardly,

1460
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,290
if you seem like you're a bad 
motherfucker,

1461
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:22,890
then people think than most people think
you are right.

1462
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:28,080
The real bad motherfuckers.
Nobody really ever knows it and they 

1463
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:28,150
don't.
They don't have to tell the world,

1464
01:07:28,151 --> 01:07:29,770
they don't have to.
It's like someone who asked me the other

1465
01:07:29,771 --> 01:07:32,860
day about if I ever get into street 
fights or anything like that.

1466
01:07:32,861 --> 01:07:34,060
And I go,
no,

1467
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:36,010
because the people that even when I want
to fight them,

1468
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:36,910
they won't.
And they're like,

1469
01:07:36,911 --> 01:07:37,500
oh,
well they all,

1470
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:38,770
oh,
who would fight you?

1471
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:40,390
And I go,
they don't know who I am.

1472
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,150
I'm not famous.
I'm not a celebrity.

1473
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,280
They don't know our,
amongst martial artists.

1474
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:46,560
Right.
And you know,

1475
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:51,600
if I,
if you give me my little pocket of 

1476
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:51,600
people,
yeah,

1477
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:51,600
I'm fucking somebody there.

1478
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,790
But in general you're here.
I'm sure dog on.

1479
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,390
I'm so popular.
I'm so amazingly.

1480
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:58,330
I'm just all flammable.
But the rest of the world,

1481
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,490
nobody knows who the fuck I am.
I'm okay with that.

1482
01:08:00,491 --> 01:08:01,530
So,
you know,

1483
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,640
I've had guys,
I balled me,

1484
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:06,490
whatever I've seen the fucking the signs
of it.

1485
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,010
You think if anybody knows when the 
fight gonna happen and be a fighter.

1486
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:14,011
So when I go,
or if someone's being a Dick 

1487
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:15,400
deliberately in my presence or to a 
woman that's,

1488
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:19,150
that's around or whatever,
and I step up and I say something like,

1489
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:24,450
I go,
people don't want to fight me and I owe 

1490
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:24,450
because you're bigger.
No,

1491
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:24,450
no.
It's got nothing to do any of that.

1492
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:26,210
Because when you look into somebody's 
eyes,

1493
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,540
you can tell who really wants to fucking
fuck people up.

1494
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:32,270
Who really doesn't.
And I don't get upset.

1495
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:34,130
I don't yell,
I don't scream.

1496
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,290
I don't have any,
I don't have to do any of that.

1497
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:41,620
I just look at them.
I tell them how it's going to be and I 

1498
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:41,620
let him know if this is what we want to 
do.

1499
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:43,710
Like I'll enjoy it.
Like,

1500
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,100
let's just please make this happen.
I've said the one guy,

1501
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,810
I'm like,
how many friends do you got?

1502
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:49,250
He was like,
why?

1503
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,520
Because you don't have enough.
Let me just tell you that much.

1504
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:57,610
Or I told one dude or do you don't know 
anybody that knows anybody that knows 

1505
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:57,610
anybody that knows anybody that kicked 
my ass.

1506
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,300
I don't know what you're going to do 
here.

1507
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:03,560
But getting a bad way,
I laughed at a guy to anthrax,

1508
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:07,590
I'm standing there with a girl and he 
keeps trying to nudge.

1509
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:10,470
People keep trying to manage through 
right where we're at and I'm like,

1510
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:13,800
of all places you see a dude and a chick
go somewhere else.

1511
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:16,530
So I'm standing right there and I 
decided that's it.

1512
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,730
They're going to have to start going 
around.

1513
01:09:17,731 --> 01:09:19,190
So I keep my elbows out,
tries.

1514
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:21,090
I feel as dude bumping into me on the 
rise,

1515
01:09:21,091 --> 01:09:23,040
I can't get through and he tries to get 
thrown the left,

1516
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:25,500
but I'm just standing tall so he's 
trying to get around it.

1517
01:09:25,501 --> 01:09:30,501
But he can't.
It's like pushing him over him running 

1518
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:30,960
himself into my own elbow.
And then he starts getting mad.

1519
01:09:30,961 --> 01:09:33,030
I'm just,
he's yelling at me about something.

1520
01:09:33,031 --> 01:09:37,250
I'm going,
what is trying to get through man?

1521
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:39,010
And he goes,
I saw,

1522
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,140
I saw this,
that.

1523
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:42,060
And I said,
can I go?

1524
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:45,120
Anthrax is playing.
I can't fucking hear what you're saying.

1525
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,890
And he's looking at me crazy.
I go,

1526
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:51,891
just walk up to the front and he gets 
all fucking wild eyed and he's looking 

1527
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:53,430
at me crazy and I go,
is this what you want to do?

1528
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:55,260
Yeah.
I just started laughing at him.

1529
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,790
I go,
you just need to keep moving,

1530
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,330
and eventually the girl in front reaches
up and grabs a hold of his arm,

1531
01:10:00,331 --> 01:10:01,950
pulls down and go,
don't do this,

1532
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:07,820
don't do this.
I'm just smiling the whole time and he 

1533
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:07,820
just fucking.
Of course he leaves.

1534
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,120
It's all about the posture and you get 
upset.

1535
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:09,960
When I look at you,
you're,

1536
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:10,410
you ready?

1537
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,070
Recurring this in your mind.
You're recreating this in your mind.

1538
01:10:13,071 --> 01:10:18,071
I can see your pulse.
Quicken your testosterone that I stay 

1539
01:10:18,071 --> 01:10:20,370
calm but carry a grudge.
You carry your story.

1540
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,810
So I'm a Scorpio,
so apparently according to all the books

1541
01:10:23,811 --> 01:10:25,050
that are out there,
I.

1542
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:25,760
Yeah,
cary grow,

1543
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:27,560
but it's also.
It's total stripper talk.

1544
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,070
Yeah,
it is.

1545
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:33,680
I'm a Scorpio.
Spicy thing is a.

1546
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,660
I love being in those violent 
confrontations.

1547
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:39,480
Why do you like that?

1548
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,580
Is it because when you were picked on 
when you were a kid,

1549
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:47,670
you still harbor some resentment?
Towards people that we fuck with you 

1550
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:48,310
because you're a nice guy.
You would never fuck with anybody,

1551
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:53,430
but if someone was fucking with you,
it's almost like now you have a license 

1552
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:53,430
to.
Yeah.

1553
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:54,800
I can't put a finger on it.
It was,

1554
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,460
I knew that,
uh,

1555
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:00,740
I enjoyed fighting when I was a kid.
Like being in the fights.

1556
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:03,290
I didn't start the fight,
but if you gave me a reason,

1557
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:08,950
cool.
And then my mom said I was the angriest 

1558
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:08,950
kid ever.
She said,

1559
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,310
well,
when I was born I came out frowning.

1560
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,590
I looked like I looked like Ron Paul and
I fucking,

1561
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:13,910
she

1562
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,160
tried to hug me and I stiff armed her 
area and she said,

1563
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,130
broker fucking art.
I got the.

1564
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:23,420
I wouldn't let my own mother holding me.
Wow.

1565
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:26,570
And I was yellow and jaundiced and I was
an asshole apparently.

1566
01:11:26,571 --> 01:11:28,250
I just came out.
I was like,

1567
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,070
and she said,
as a kid I just,

1568
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:36,530
I would,
once I blew up about if I got angry,

1569
01:11:36,531 --> 01:11:39,290
I got so angry.
It wasn't like a temper Tantrum,

1570
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:40,060
angry.
It was like,

1571
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,380
phew.
Ming-Li raging violent,

1572
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,880
like flames,
daggers.

1573
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:48,920
I'm just,
that's connected between your health at 

1574
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:48,920
birth,
you know,

1575
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,091
being in poor health at birth and being 
brought into this world in a bad 

1576
01:11:52,091 --> 01:11:54,140
situation where you're uncomfortable.
Yellow and jaundiced.

1577
01:11:54,141 --> 01:11:59,141
I wonder if that like set the stage for 
an angry or maybe you got some viking 

1578
01:11:59,141 --> 01:12:01,370
jeans.
I might got some Viking genes in there.

1579
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:04,430
Even if I bought those,
I bought those at Nordstrom.

1580
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:06,970
True Religion,
Viking jeans,

1581
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:11,260
chuck notice gusset horns and a beard on
the crotch.

1582
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,360
As long as it has plenty of like really 
big buttons.

1583
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:19,510
Snaps.
Intricately carved a place to hang my 

1584
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:19,700
hat,
my hands.

1585
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,620
It has to be pre damaged.
Pretty damning.

1586
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:25,160
Of course it has to look like it's 
already been through.

1587
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,330
You know,
the Poetic Edda.

1588
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:31,420
That's the only thing that's almost as 
gay as the sagging pants is the caught 

1589
01:12:31,521 --> 01:12:33,110
up pants.
The chopped up.

1590
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:37,520
The stress is that I went to one place 
and I was like,

1591
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,930
do you have any fucking pants?

1592
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,750
Don't have holes in them.
Can I just buy a pair of.

1593
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,780
I like to have a regular pair of jeans.
I'm not a child.

1594
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:46,430
Sorry.
This is not.

1595
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:49,100
This is not gonna last,
this fake worn out jeans.

1596
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:54,280
This shit is temporary and I'm not 
buying a fucking pair of jeans that are 

1597
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:54,280
fake,
worn out.

1598
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,420
It's one thing you wear a pair of jeans 
out.

1599
01:12:56,421 --> 01:13:00,260
There's pride in that because these are 
jeans I've had for 10 fucking years.

1600
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,700
They're comfortable is shit.
Yeah,

1601
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:04,400
there's some holes in them,
but I broke them in man.

1602
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:07,790
I think so and so in those days.
There you go.

1603
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:13,090
I don't know if I have any.
I want to actually take that DNA test 

1604
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,880
that tells you why they can tell you if.
Because I know I'm German and I know I'm

1605
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,490
Irish and Cherokee Indian and I brought 
some English in me,

1606
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:21,290
but no,
I got Indiana toll on me.

1607
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:26,650
I know I do.
This brow Ridge fucking brother in law 

1608
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:26,650
used to call me the,
uh,

1609
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:31,840
the eagle from the muppets,
the muppets and I never even thought 

1610
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:37,730
about the eagle is such a prominent 
frown asshole path.

1611
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:42,590
That's a funny fucker.
But I want to take that test to also see

1612
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:44,600
if I got the warrior gene.
Oh yeah.

1613
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:46,040
There is a warranty supposed to make.
Make

1614
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:50,060
People Kinda gnarly and,
and the thing is like,

1615
01:13:50,061 --> 01:13:52,740
I don't have to have anything personal 
or any girls.

1616
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:56,090
I don't to get into a fight,
but I enjoyed it.

1617
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:59,480
I even getting hit hitting back like 
just the whole thing.

1618
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:04,690
I know for me fighting is a time I feel 
most alive and free in the entire world 

1619
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:09,940
because I can go out there and do just 
about anything I can do with who I am 

1620
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:12,250
and no one's going to try and stop me.
Do you prefer

1621
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:16,870
I'm old school rules rules?
I prefer for those who don't know,

1622
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:19,060
super raw was soccer kids.
Stomps.

1623
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,430
Had I prefer headbutts elbows?
No.

1624
01:14:22,431 --> 01:14:23,470
No,
I understand.

1625
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:25,120
No gloves.
Our gloves,

1626
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,410
they were,
I think they were gloves.

1627
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:31,411
Do you prefer gloves or no gloves.
I prefer gloves only for your own kind 

1628
01:14:31,411 --> 01:14:32,560
of fit but uh,
or broken hands.

1629
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:38,090
But uh,
not to say that it's really been doing 

1630
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:38,890
much shinier hand wrote this.
He's got a broken leg.

1631
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,950
A lot of broken hands.
Nma.

1632
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:40,960
Yeah.
Uh,

1633
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,940
but a super common,
right?

1634
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:43,750
Yeah.
Very.

1635
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:45,730
Is there any way around that?

1636
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:49,940
It's hard to say.
I don't know if it's an equipment thing.

1637
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:55,450
Is it possible to pad the gloves more or
is it just that one thing I noticed and 

1638
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,720
pride,
there wasn't that many broken hands.

1639
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:58,790
Yeah,
well I was asking that once too,

1640
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,680
and I was saying,
is it a better glove?

1641
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:02,360
Is a pride glove,
a thicker glove?

1642
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:07,470
Uh,
not necessarily son I would say because 

1643
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:07,470
it's all fixed fights.
Oh,

1644
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:11,720
of course.
Say that he's so crazy.

1645
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,000
Well,
he said some of that shed about like the

1646
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:15,240
like pride fights.
Like,

1647
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,110
come on man,
you know,

1648
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:18,120
some of that is just,

1649
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,980
it's brilliant stance to take.
It's such a,

1650
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,280
it's such a fucking aggressive,
just obnoxious thing to say someone is 

1651
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:32,071
bound to get run now who's done or the 
person that gets mad at the person who 

1652
01:15:32,071 --> 01:15:32,071
says it,
person gets mad

1653
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:37,200
of course.
But the problem is there's a wee bit a 

1654
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,880
truth in the fact that some fights in 
pride.

1655
01:15:38,881 --> 01:15:41,250
We're staged.
So like if you look at Coleman Takata,

1656
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:43,800
it's pretty obvious or something going 
on there.

1657
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,140
There's a few every now and that.
I mean,

1658
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:48,780
you look at like a cro cop,
Nogueira.

1659
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,930
That's a real fucking fight.
There's no doubt about it.

1660
01:15:51,931 --> 01:15:54,300
That's a real fucking fine.
But man,

1661
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:57,450
you watched Coleman tap out to that heel
hooks from Chicago.

1662
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:02,100
Wait a minute.
Oh,

1663
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:08,060
I mean it was ridiculous.
It's not the best example of pride.

1664
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:11,370
What was it like being.
You were there in the golden era,

1665
01:16:11,371 --> 01:16:16,371
man.
I mean you were there during the time 

1666
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:16,740
when pride was,
in my opinion,

1667
01:16:16,741 --> 01:16:21,570
like put on some of the greatest shows 
in mixed martial arts history to pride,

1668
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:24,990
openlink Grand Prix,
the middleweight Grand Prix.

1669
01:16:24,991 --> 01:16:29,991
I mean you just look at just the 
historic fights like minute Toro versus 

1670
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:34,281
Bob Sapp.
I mean there was some crazy historic 

1671
01:16:34,281 --> 01:16:35,230
fights from your era.
That was a.

1672
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,120
You were there,
man.

1673
01:16:36,121 --> 01:16:38,400
You were there for all that shit.
What was that like?

1674
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,920
Unfucking believable dude was like 
performing for was the biggest crowd you

1675
01:16:42,921 --> 01:16:46,920
did a biggest crowd ever fought in front
of was $50,000.

1676
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,520
The biggest.
The biggest crowd I ever stepped out in 

1677
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:52,520
front of them at least grabbed the mic,
was 93.

1678
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,390
Jesus to want to tell you how big it is 
here and I go,

1679
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:01,400
it is,
and in America it's once it hits the 

1680
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,540
media,
the way American media is,

1681
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:06,380
things blow up in such a different 
capacity than they do in Japan,

1682
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:10,230
but man,
we were stepping in front of $30,000

1683
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:14,270
on a regular basis.
I did a show with Hulk Hogan,

1684
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:17,600
you know,
Hulk Hogan wrestling shown on 55,000

1685
01:17:17,601 --> 01:17:20,440
people and I fought a,
you know,

1686
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,280
she thought,
Gosh,

1687
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,510
independent my king of pancreas in the 
Tokyo Dome.

1688
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:25,370
That's.
It doesn't.

1689
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:30,490
Those shows were on such a different 
level than what we see here in the 

1690
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:33,590
states and the feeling of course feeling
is going to be different in terms of the

1691
01:17:33,591 --> 01:17:37,100
culturally it's going to be way 
different because you have Japan,

1692
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:42,101
this incredible homogeneous society with
their ways and very specific versus 

1693
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:43,160
America.

1694
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,940
So trying to compare that sort of thing 
is not really fair.

1695
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:52,930
Apples and oranges really is.
People are different everywhere you go 

1696
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:54,440
hold those fights in Uganda or you hold 
them in Transylvania or what.

1697
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,560
They're always going to be different 
because people's cultures are different.

1698
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:02,980
A plaid,
they felt so dynamic.

1699
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:07,020
Those shows,
they were so big,

1700
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,040
it wasn't just the lights and that was 
the mood,

1701
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:15,220
the setting.
When that music would start up and the 

1702
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:15,220
lights would drop,
don't,

1703
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:15,310
don't,
don't,

1704
01:18:15,311 --> 01:18:20,311
don't,
and you're sitting in back and I'm 

1705
01:18:20,311 --> 01:18:20,390
fighting like ninth or something,
but I'm all of a sudden I'm just wired,

1706
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:21,320
I'm ready to go.
I'm like,

1707
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:24,260
let's just fucking grab swords and start
screaming and running down the ramp.

1708
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:27,150
A lot of pageantry to those events too.
I mean,

1709
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,920
look,
I did not appreciate it sometimes when I

1710
01:18:29,921 --> 01:18:34,921
was like,
just get into the fucking fights 

1711
01:18:34,921 --> 01:18:36,541
already,
like six hours long and you like to be 

1712
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:37,270
so jazzed up in the beginning,
but looking back,

1713
01:18:37,271 --> 01:18:39,610
man,
when everybody would line up,

1714
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:44,640
you know,
when they would introduce fighters one 

1715
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:44,640
at a time and they would all line up,
you're like,

1716
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,600
wow,
this is going to be a fucking epic 

1717
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,151
night.
It really did build it up and it really 

1718
01:18:51,151 --> 01:18:52,060
did make it more of a special event.
You know?

1719
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,070
I mean,
the UFC,

1720
01:18:54,071 --> 01:18:56,680
they've kind of done away with even some
of the walk ins,

1721
01:18:56,681 --> 01:18:56,920
like,
well,

1722
01:18:56,921 --> 01:19:01,921
we're pressed for time.
Sometimes guys are already in the cage 

1723
01:19:01,921 --> 01:19:02,020
and there's no walking at all.

1724
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:05,600
It doesn't even have walked in.
Uh,

1725
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:06,430
I,
I,

1726
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:11,510
you know,
a TV product definitely changes things 

1727
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,510
and in Japan they're TV system is way 
different than they,

1728
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,750
than we run out.

1729
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,010
Joel,
he'll deal over.

1730
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:15,790
I'll get burned.
Yeah.

1731
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:16,300
He,
uh,

1732
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:20,760
he was a big fan of Michael Jackson's 
and he thought it would be real cool

1733
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,000
to set himself on fire before he went 
out and fought.

1734
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:27,480
Not what Jerry curl before he lit up.
Oh,

1735
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:30,270
Jerry curl has another thing that ever 
happened.

1736
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:36,450
And Pre ripped jeans.
How the fuck did those exist?

1737
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,490
He'll got hit with.

1738
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,920
He was in the wrong spot.
I don't know if the marker was wrong or 

1739
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:47,601
he lost in translation and he got hit 
with some pyrotechnics and it just lit 

1740
01:19:48,661 --> 01:19:49,680
him up.
Now.

1741
01:19:49,681 --> 01:19:51,690
Thankfully he,
you know,

1742
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,900
with the burns,
he was able to,

1743
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:56,010
to come back and he even fought again in
pride.

1744
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,350
Um,
and so I'm really,

1745
01:19:59,040 --> 01:19:59,940
really glad that,
that,

1746
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:04,970
that was the case because you'll hear 
the Olivia and luke delivery legend 

1747
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,780
school nhb dude at that.
That's.

1748
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:07,630
Yeah.
Sad

1749
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:08,200
though.
It's sad.

1750
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,480
I mean,
for a lot of people don't know.

1751
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:12,030
He was one of the original guys back in 
the day,

1752
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:14,250
you know,
he fought in some of those,

1753
01:20:14,251 --> 01:20:14,940
uh,
those,

1754
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:16,050
uh,
valley to two events,

1755
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,590
the bare knuckle,
no rules,

1756
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:24,591
events there were so crazy.
Like when Gary Goodrich fought that 

1757
01:20:24,591 --> 01:20:26,850
Pedro grabbed this deck and they really 
reached into his pants,

1758
01:20:26,851 --> 01:20:31,851
there was no rule against it.
So reach into his pants and crushed his 

1759
01:20:31,851 --> 01:20:33,870
balls and his dick in his hand like no 
one had ever thought of that.

1760
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,570
No one had ever.
But Gary went so deep,

1761
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,180
he literally grabbed the guy showed 
deep.

1762
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,470
Oh,
Gary Good.

1763
01:20:41,471 --> 01:20:45,460
Which is a fucking arm wrestling 
champion with these gigantic arms.

1764
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:48,250
And just imagine that that guy crushing 
your package.

1765
01:20:48,251 --> 01:20:53,251
I think he might've started off with the
tickle just to let go the underlings.

1766
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:57,190
And if tickle turned into a squeeze and 
see the guide,

1767
01:20:57,650 --> 01:21:02,650
the guy didn't tap out immediately.
It wasn't like saying giant black man 

1768
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:03,730
hand in my crotch screaming,
fuck no.

1769
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,180
Yeah.

1770
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,280
Finger and uh,
you know,

1771
01:21:12,281 --> 01:21:13,420
he was giving me a shocker.

1772
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:17,780
Prostate balls were already numb.
It's like he had taken so many.

1773
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:20,570
That's why.
That's why he tapped out as Gary's.

1774
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:25,920
He's like knuckles deep and he's like,
he's got two knuckles in there and he's 

1775
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:25,920
going,
you know what to do.

1776
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,130
Do you need to go get this

1777
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:31,130
st if you know we're fighting a lot,
we need to get you out of here.

1778
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,810
And he's like,
thanks.

1779
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,150
Thank you so much.
Did,

1780
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,280
did you ever put a fight in A.
I never stuck my nipples in a man's ass.

1781
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:45,020
Any event that allowed ball shots,
like the old he attacked me,

1782
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,660
Joseph,
you know,

1783
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,150
by the,
by the time we were doing that,

1784
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,850
it was,
you always sort of a universal like,

1785
01:21:49,851 --> 01:21:50,660
dude,
don't just,

1786
01:21:50,661 --> 01:21:54,200
don't hit anybody in the nuts.
Joe Simons a famous moment in mma

1787
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,500
boom,
and he's like a tiger choke on it.

1788
01:21:57,490 --> 01:21:58,970
Especially when you,

1789
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,980
you know,
find out later that you know,

1790
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,140
joe is a fucking mass rapists and 
maniacs,

1791
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:09,350
crazy person,
crazy person who was involved in a gang 

1792
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,350
rape,
you know,

1793
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,070
they caught him for something else and 
they did a DNA scan on him.

1794
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:13,500
That guy used to always hang around the 
comedy store.

1795
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:18,650
He was always in the back room and the 
comments that you'd run into him and he 

1796
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:18,810
call everyone sir and like bout 
everyone.

1797
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:21,690
He was really weird.
It was really weird.

1798
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:26,890
Yeah.
And he have like no shirt on and he was 

1799
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:26,890
like super yolked.
Really short limbs but super.

1800
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:26,890
Yeah.

1801
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:30,320
You'd be calling everyone now

1802
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,120
this guy was like a mass or a gang 
rapists.

1803
01:22:33,121 --> 01:22:34,140
You're like,
Oh wow,

1804
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,500
what a weird guy to have hanging around 
about as bad as it can be,

1805
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:40,040
but I don't know.
I would think that I would.

1806
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:45,140
I think he,
in his mind he probably said his bar 

1807
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,421
even higher than that.
Did you ever try any of these 

1808
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,350
compression shorts?
A Cup?

1809
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:54,351
Things like videos of them,
like shockoe has one and diamond mma 

1810
01:22:54,351 --> 01:22:54,351
have one.
You know,

1811
01:22:54,351 --> 01:22:57,780
I used to wear the 30 bucks everyone 
tour,

1812
01:22:57,990 --> 01:23:02,040
but I also learned a hard lesson of if 
you're wearing.

1813
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:03,450
I see,
okay.

1814
01:23:03,451 --> 01:23:05,120
I also,
I worry about like Tito trunks,

1815
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:10,200
right?
So if you're wearing spandex trunks and 

1816
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:13,120
you put spandex shorts on underneath 
that spandex and Spandex,

1817
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:18,121
just sort of all of a sudden your outer 
trunks are turned into some sort of 

1818
01:23:18,121 --> 01:23:20,060
daisy Duke Wedgie up your ass and then 
you're under trunks are hanging.

1819
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:23,620
He just looked like a fun,
sexy as shit.

1820
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:25,420
He was like,
oh my God,

1821
01:23:25,421 --> 01:23:27,640
look at that little.
Those compression shorts is probably the

1822
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:32,320
best way to avoid a really bad ball 
shots where I keep it in place.

1823
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:37,321
Or is it a trap or Die Cup?
I think if you use Taco jockstrap just 

1824
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:39,050
trap with,
uh,

1825
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,400
with uh,
with one of those flexible cups because 

1826
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:44,400
my,
my thighs are so big that a normal cup,

1827
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,871
I just,
it just starts digging into the inside 

1828
01:23:48,871 --> 01:23:48,871
of my legs.
Those flexible cups are good.

1829
01:23:48,871 --> 01:23:49,420
But these,
uh,

1830
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:50,740
I've,
I've tried recently.

1831
01:23:50,741 --> 01:23:55,741
The reason why I asked this is a diamond
nma has this really intense compression 

1832
01:23:55,741 --> 01:23:57,740
shorts setup with all of these straps 
and his videos,

1833
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:59,940
like are you sure it's for training and 
not for like,

1834
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,870
well,
it's got a ball gag,

1835
01:24:01,871 --> 01:24:03,790
but it's optional.
The uh,

1836
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:06,670
the idea is that this guy has eliminated
the movement,

1837
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:08,620
which is where the cup fails.

1838
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:13,650
You know,
the cup moves to the side and then you 

1839
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:13,650
get kicked in the balls and the cup 
actually hits the balls,

1840
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:16,690
which obviously can happen if you just 
have a loose jock strap to the side.

1841
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,440
Yeah.
His shit is.

1842
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:19,180
Yeah,
there's no tuskie's from the side.

1843
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:24,240
This shit is slammed in place,
but Kenny Florian says that a Thai Cup 

1844
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:24,810
is the best.
He says that you could if you.

1845
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:27,970
It's uncomfortable as fuck because it 
has to go up your ass like a g string.

1846
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:30,370
But if you do it that way,
it's not moving.

1847
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,750
It's just sort of saying Kenny Florian 
isn't the mass play.

1848
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:38,090
I don't think he's into that man.
I don't think he minds shaped inner 

1849
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:39,100
thighs though.
Steel Cup,

1850
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,880
like a little piece of leather around 
rather than balm and do is grunt.

1851
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:43,720
Yeah,
you'd probably have to.

1852
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:45,820
Before you get going,
you'll probably have to use some key and

1853
01:24:45,821 --> 01:24:47,880
the size of your thighs a little bit.
Kaggle's.

1854
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,340
Okay.
They can hear it.

1855
01:24:54,341 --> 01:24:59,341
Okay.
So here we're going off in the 

1856
01:24:59,341 --> 01:24:59,341
direction.
We're talking a lot about cups.

1857
01:24:59,341 --> 01:25:03,170
Yeah.
Which is not entirely what I thought it 

1858
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:03,190
was going to be on the table today,
but it's a terrible design.

1859
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:06,010
The human body with the balls and the 
outside fighting.

1860
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:06,930
I mean we,
you,

1861
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,960
you're a fighter,
but if your involvement on the outside 

1862
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:11,960
she couldn't like true lick them while 
you're adding.

1863
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,420
You're stroking it.
Yeah.

1864
01:25:13,421 --> 01:25:14,820
It's like a trade off.
Yeah.

1865
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,140
I mean you gotta you got the good with 
the bad on that.

1866
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:20,590
What a ridiculous button that every man 
has his button seeing.

1867
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,000
Ding,
Ding,

1868
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,080
Ding.
It's out there.

1869
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:28,081
Everybody knows where it is.
We're all running around vulnerable and 

1870
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:28,240
we've made countless jokes about it.
If you couldn't,

1871
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:30,820
didn't know that it was not only with 
the painful.

1872
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:33,960
It's hilarious.
Yeah.

1873
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:36,860
Even when you're watching an mma about 
and uh,

1874
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:38,560
someone to get kicked in the balls,
like,

1875
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:40,810
oh,
one more time.

1876
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:41,650
Yeah,
let's launch a few.

1877
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:43,060
Yeah,
we always replay it.

1878
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,160
I don't know why.
There's no reason to.

1879
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:49,990
There's got to be fetishes built around 
cups,

1880
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,640
I'm sure.
Absolutely.

1881
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:56,730
I'm sure people like someone that 
where's the cup and gets a boner under 

1882
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:57,960
the cup somehow.
I don't know.

1883
01:25:58,110 --> 01:26:03,020
It's like crushing is mushroom were 
dudes that like jerking off to guys.

1884
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,580
Joseph,
I heard your podcast.

1885
01:26:10,581 --> 01:26:13,690
Joseph wasn't funny.
What were you send them to me.

1886
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:17,840
He should.
He shouldn't really tell this story,

1887
01:26:17,841 --> 01:26:21,740
but he was focusing on former UFC 
heavyweight champion,

1888
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:26,950
great,
great kickboxer world kickboxing 

1889
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:26,950
champion and trained in honor of a 
utility bill.

1890
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:31,780
Not a joke.
So he's got this leather utility belt 

1891
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:36,011
thing with pockets and pouches and all 
this shit and gadgets as monogrammed on 

1892
01:26:36,231 --> 01:26:40,250
it for multiple sclerosis.
So it's not quite a fanny pack.

1893
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:42,890
Oh,
it is the ultimate of fanny packs.

1894
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:46,910
It's Batman utility belt.
I'm a little jealous.

1895
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,080
Well,
he can get one made for you.

1896
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:53,120
I mean,
he was pretty proud to tell me about 

1897
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:53,120
where I'm like,
I am actually mocking you.

1898
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,230
I'm not,
I'm not asking for free for,

1899
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,480
for location on where I could have one 
of my own.

1900
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,830
You saw,
I'm sure you saw Maurice,

1901
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,300
his last fight.
Of course I did.

1902
01:26:59,301 --> 01:27:01,460
I jumped out of my chair.
I was losing my shit.

1903
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,410
It was so awesome.
And I,

1904
01:27:02,411 --> 01:27:05,270
I know exactly when it was all going to 
go down hill.

1905
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:10,810
There was a point because I used to spar
and race all the time and he's standing 

1906
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:11,540
out in front of the guy and he kinda 
gets this little grin.

1907
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:12,160
I go,
that's it.

1908
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,480
He's figured this dude out.
He's got them handled.

1909
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:19,930
This only going to get worse from here 
and the more mode doesn't go for the 

1910
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:22,901
kill.
He's not like a get in there and just 

1911
01:27:22,901 --> 01:27:22,901
trying to annihilate you.
Do he chopped you just score.

1912
01:27:22,901 --> 01:27:23,630
Score.
Score.

1913
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:27,170
Job Too hard.
It's too hard to score.

1914
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:27,800
Score.

1915
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:31,550
That's Maury Smith.
So,

1916
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:34,230
um,
so anyway,

1917
01:27:34,231 --> 01:27:36,530
so he's,
he's fighting say score,

1918
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:39,220
score,
score score.

1919
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:40,850
If you,
if you keep landing you're good.

1920
01:27:40,851 --> 01:27:42,740
But you know,
eventually I'll try to go for the kill.

1921
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:44,540
You set yourself up and you know,
eventually,

1922
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:49,720
yes.
Eventually the right shop will present 

1923
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:49,720
itself.
So you know the,

1924
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:50,270
he threw that right hand and step right 
kick.

1925
01:27:50,271 --> 01:27:52,910
He knew the guy was going to take off to
his left and the aid it and it was,

1926
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:56,660
oh his majesty.
He was great in the first Coleman fight,

1927
01:27:56,661 --> 01:28:01,661
man,
whether when you really got a chance to 

1928
01:28:01,661 --> 01:28:01,661
see talk all that shit.
He's like,

1929
01:28:01,661 --> 01:28:01,661
oh,
you hit like a girl and all this.

1930
01:28:01,661 --> 01:28:05,390
And Coleman tried to punch them out and 
gassed and he just took his phone and he

1931
01:28:05,391 --> 01:28:07,330
never got upset by it.
All I was,

1932
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,680
I was talking to,
me and him were talking before the fight

1933
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:12,800
and everybody thought he was going to 
his death and Maurice was,

1934
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:18,410
he was so calm.
He was just hanging out back there with 

1935
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:20,950
kirk the duties to train them and to 
transcend the mind.

1936
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:24,080
Settle down.

1937
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:26,630
Marie Smith,

1938
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:32,760
he's driving around in his porsche 
kickboxer old like read,

1939
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:37,830
done.
He always had like 73 was like a little 

1940
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:39,100
too much engine.
The GTT kid on it or something.

1941
01:28:39,101 --> 01:28:44,101
So anyways,
he's driving around this porsche and I 

1942
01:28:44,101 --> 01:28:44,101
think somebody,
he,

1943
01:28:44,101 --> 01:28:45,620
he,
I don't remember how he ended up getting

1944
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,730
contact with us.
He was fighting,

1945
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:51,750
he was doing an extreme fighting and 
then he fight in UFC and this guy at a 

1946
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:52,930
bus stop somehow he said,
and he goes,

1947
01:28:52,931 --> 01:28:55,270
Hey,
I want to buy something off of you.

1948
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,310
And Maria says like,
okay,

1949
01:28:57,311 --> 01:29:02,311
he's like anybody with jock strap.
Emory's had his stuff on him and he goes

1950
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:04,830
like 300 bucks,

1951
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:10,720
documenter bucks takes off and is like,

1952
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,200
you can do whatever he wants.
What an idiot,

1953
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:14,160
you know,
I ain't got $300.

1954
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:20,890
And you have now a Maurice Smith limited
edition semen stained fricking jockstrap

1955
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:24,320
now like maybe the guys wearing it on 
his face,

1956
01:29:24,321 --> 01:29:26,940
like darth vader,
like it's something but something.

1957
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:30,060
And then it made me think,
what is my jock strapless?

1958
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:32,970
What I sell it.
Fuck yeah.

1959
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,070
How much

1960
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,770
I'd like to get five fingers.
Four fingers,

1961
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:41,960
thousand bucks.
That's not impossible.

1962
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:44,060
You know what I think if you could take,
well it's too bad.

1963
01:29:44,061 --> 01:29:46,530
You probably already watched it from the
great man.

1964
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,270
You know what?
It'd be amazing plastic bags.

1965
01:29:50,271 --> 01:29:55,271
I'm not saying you should fake this,
but if you did have plastic bags where 

1966
01:29:55,271 --> 01:29:59,290
you structure your shock from the randy 
couture fight is in a Ziploc bag for 

1967
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:04,480
medically sealed medically seal.
This is the jock strap you were wearing 

1968
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,550
when you won the title straps.
Yeah.

1969
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,260
Only jockstraps.
Yeah.

1970
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:15,290
Good.
If you just had them all in a file at 

1971
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:15,290
home.
I'm not saying you should fake this,

1972
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:19,390
but if you did have like a file that you
pull apart and it was filled with 

1973
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:19,760
organized.
How many fights have you had?

1974
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:20,020
No.

1975
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,350
Fuck a unsanctioned.
Okay.

1976
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:28,370
Included over 50.
Could you imagine if you had 50 plastic 

1977
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:30,630
bags filled with every jockstrap from 
every fight he'd ever been in,

1978
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:33,630
including some blood on him,
some smeared,

1979
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:38,890
you know,
some with quick knockouts where you 

1980
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:38,890
didn't even really get.
I'm stinky.

1981
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:47,010
They would have to be hermetically seal 
because of the smell is a radiator shops

1982
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:47,650
for,
for,

1983
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:52,110
for like a 50 mile radius of pulling 
every woman and every feral dog.

1984
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:54,760
Shit.
Coyotes at night.

1985
01:30:55,490 --> 01:31:00,490
And uh,
the like the MBA one would probably be 

1986
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:01,860
worth the most because there's still 
like sweat inside the bag.

1987
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,370
Something like bubbles,
some moisture bubbles in the bag,

1988
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:06,660
you know,
we're like,

1989
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,100
yeah,
go back to the pride days.

1990
01:31:08,101 --> 01:31:11,960
Those are dried out right now.
They've shrunk a little event.

1991
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:18,040
That would be somebody like,
someone's going to do it now because we 

1992
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:18,390
brought it up.
We set that in motion.

1993
01:31:18,391 --> 01:31:21,150
This is going to be sold.
I got to pay for tires if I keep blowing

1994
01:31:21,151 --> 01:31:26,151
up.
So what better than to use a little bit 

1995
01:31:26,151 --> 01:31:26,820
of a laugh around my waist might be able
to retire on this.

1996
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,700
I'm telling you,
if you could just stop,

1997
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:29,670
you could,
you would,

1998
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:33,600
you could retire on something as 
ridiculous as that sounds.

1999
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:35,160
The jocks job.
Well,

2000
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:40,161
we should put up a thing.
You got one more fight coming up in 

2001
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:40,161
strikeforce,
right?

2002
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:40,570
Yeah.
When,

2003
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,750
how long has he been going to be before 
your hands healed?

2004
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:48,050
Uh,
I'm sure I got at least another three 

2005
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:48,050
months.
What do you have to do for like physical

2006
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:50,460
therapy when that happens?
Did they put a pin in it?

2007
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:55,461
And everything,
I'm going to have that removed at some 

2008
01:31:55,461 --> 01:31:58,971
point.
Basically you have to have that removed 

2009
01:31:58,971 --> 01:31:58,971
or is it an option?
No,

2010
01:31:58,971 --> 01:32:01,510
I don't have to,
but I think it's smarter in the long run

2011
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:06,570
to heal the stronger.
That way a lot of people don't have 

2012
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:06,570
plates in there on the plate is the 
problem.

2013
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:08,170
Right.
And if it does break,

2014
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:11,520
if you break the hardware and that ain't
got that crap stuck in the bone,

2015
01:32:11,521 --> 01:32:12,430
it makes it even worse.

2016
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:16,350
Put it all back together.
What's a Nogueira situation like this?

2017
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:21,370
I think it's called a humorous.
The upper bone snapped when a mere 

2018
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:21,370
tapped him.

2019
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,890
I think he just started rubbing off on 
it.

2020
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:25,200
They,
uh,

2021
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,480
his issue right now is the plane,
you know,

2022
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,430
I don't know if they can go in and take 
it out though.

2023
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:32,820
Is it every fight?
No,

2024
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:35,110
he pulled out of the Congo fine.
He can,

2025
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:40,120
uh,
he apparently is in intense pain during 

2026
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:40,450
wrestling when he was fine for a little 
while.

2027
01:32:40,451 --> 01:32:42,850
But then when it got to wrestling,
it was just too much pain,

2028
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:45,880
I guess,
that that plate,

2029
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,400
digging into your bones and digging into
the army,

2030
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:52,260
I don't think you're supposed to.
I mean,

2031
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:56,200
I think that has to be probably removed 
if you're gonna engage in sports.

2032
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:58,010
What about um,
uh,

2033
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:58,990
mirrors,
leg,

2034
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:02,350
whatever happened with that.
Does he still have the plate?

2035
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:07,350
And then I probably the prosthetic with 
a machine gun and so great hides his 

2036
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:09,100
knives.
He's still crazy,

2037
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,420
strongest dudes walking the planet and 
I'm covered in weapons,

2038
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,210
convert it.
God,

2039
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:15,850
all the people that want to attack me.

2040
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,950
Well,
I don't know what that's all about,

2041
01:33:17,951 --> 01:33:19,790
but he is the wrong dude to fuck.

2042
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:20,700
Yeah.
No.

2043
01:33:20,701 --> 01:33:22,360
You know what,
if he fell down a flight of stairs,

2044
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:24,240
he stabbed and stuff to death and shoot 
people.

2045
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:24,480
Yeah.

2046
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:32,550
Got Two office buildings.
Trips on the sidewalk.

2047
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:35,770
Ankle gun goes off.
Oh,

2048
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,460
is the gas station across the street is 
dictate or just stats?

2049
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,320
Yeah.
What's up with him?

2050
01:33:43,321 --> 01:33:44,790
I was like,
who's already a killer?

2051
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:47,280
And he wants to be like fully armed to 
the teeth when he leaves her house,

2052
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:48,610
he's like a real survivalist type.
The

2053
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:53,670
dude and that way you live in Vegas.
I imagine his survival skills are a lot 

2054
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:57,901
different than the usual guy.
Like how do you avoid vomit on the 

2055
01:33:57,901 --> 01:34:00,451
street?
And I didn't get into the Strip club 

2056
01:34:00,451 --> 01:34:00,880
without paying.
When you work there,

2057
01:34:00,881 --> 01:34:02,470
it's easy.
But what?

2058
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:06,850
Vegas is a dark place though as far as 
like Vegas.

2059
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:07,870
I'm like,
I hate Vegas.

2060
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:11,060
I don't like it because it's one,
it's,

2061
01:34:11,061 --> 01:34:16,061
it's,
it's purposefully fake an engineered to 

2062
01:34:16,061 --> 01:34:19,351
fuck you up.
Like even from the carpet from the way 

2063
01:34:19,351 --> 01:34:22,720
they did.
I think it's kind of cool that they 

2064
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,650
figured out the ways to make you gamble 
and spend money and fuck your life over 

2065
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:27,580
to a scientist.
Some formula like wow,

2066
01:34:27,581 --> 01:34:30,010
that's pretty good.
That's fucking cool.

2067
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:31,960
In a way,
I just don't want it to happen to me.

2068
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,870
But then once you leave the strip,
right?

2069
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:37,260
Leave all the opulence and all the cool 
shit that they're there,

2070
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:42,380
all the fucking things that they're 
dangling out there to pull you in and 

2071
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:44,650
you get just outside the strip.
Like every service industry thing around

2072
01:34:44,651 --> 01:34:47,460
there is filled full of all the last 
great tea.

2073
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,910
Fucking prison,
tatted,

2074
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,460
like wrangled up,
fucking used condoms.

2075
01:34:51,461 --> 01:34:56,461
Have people that,
that all like lost everything in Vegas 

2076
01:34:56,461 --> 01:34:57,530
and they can't leave and

2077
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,830
you know,
you go and you order your,

2078
01:34:59,831 --> 01:35:03,590
your sonic burger and you're like,
fuck dude,

2079
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:08,620
I don't know what happened to you,
but I that looks contagious and I don't 

2080
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:09,040
really like,
you know,

2081
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:11,750
seven like fucking snaggle tooth on one 
side.

2082
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:14,070
It's a strange,
strange part of the news.

2083
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:16,250
Strange part of the country.
Desert,

2084
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:18,190
desert.
What is it?

2085
01:35:18,191 --> 01:35:20,000
A desert miss?
There's life in the desert.

2086
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:22,250
I've seen on that national geographic 
bullshit too.

2087
01:35:22,251 --> 01:35:24,890
I know it,
but not really meant for us.

2088
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:26,450
Yeah.
You know who lives in the desert?

2089
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,930
Crazy people.
Chromogens are Weirdos.

2090
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:35,230
We were actually talking about that 
before you got here were like the shit 

2091
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:35,230
goes down.
Vegas is one of the last places you want

2092
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:37,640
to be because there's no food there.
They can't get food,

2093
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:40,960
so once the truck stopped coming in and 
playing stop landing with food,

2094
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:43,210
$6,
prime ribs gone,

2095
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:43,970
all that shit.

2096
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,380
Yeah,
no money.

2097
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:47,770
There's no money for casinos.
Said northwest.

2098
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,820
You can grow everything you need up 
there.

2099
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:51,890
That's the truth.
That's the truth.

2100
01:35:51,891 --> 01:35:56,891
I was watching the video.
Chael sonnen preparing for Anderson 

2101
01:35:56,891 --> 01:35:57,170
Silva and it showed Portland.
I'm like,

2102
01:35:57,171 --> 01:35:58,670
God damn,
that's beautiful.

2103
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:01,760
Go fucking green.
Everything is green and healthy.

2104
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:03,260
I mean,
you could have an incredible car.

2105
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,580
You'd have a serious problem.
Portland,

2106
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,340
why all the people with the fucking 
disks in their ears?

2107
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:08,860
You'd be.
You'd be off.

2108
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,800
Put all the other sizes.
Not Sagging yet.

2109
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:14,120
I know.
That's another thing.

2110
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:17,060
I don't get the bullring so many 
beautiful women have that.

2111
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:23,540
It's just like it should only be okay if
you can attach a little chain onto it 

2112
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:23,600
and drag them around.
What's that?

2113
01:36:23,601 --> 01:36:25,280
A girl or Tina Marie,
didn't she?

2114
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:28,060
She had the nose like this thing go into
the war to the ear,

2115
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:30,260
right number,
yeah.

2116
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:34,040
Portland does have a lot of freaky 
people with those nose rings.

2117
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:39,130
That nose ring is so unnecessary.
I've seen some girls nose ring and it's 

2118
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:41,750
kind of sexy,
like I did it a girl once you had a ring

2119
01:36:41,751 --> 01:36:44,420
in or not.
People can pull shit off,

2120
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:46,910
but they can't pull off that bull ring.
That's pretty.

2121
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:51,970
I've never seen anybody.
The other thing is chest tattoos on a 

2122
01:36:51,970 --> 01:36:52,970
woman is not my thing.
Unless she's hot as fuck.

2123
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,540
I was so goal with the wings and I look 
at it,

2124
01:36:56,541 --> 01:37:01,541
but I'm like,
you're not a sailor apa fight or 

2125
01:37:01,541 --> 01:37:01,541
something like,
no,

2126
01:37:01,541 --> 01:37:03,920
you're not.
So you don't know what you have tits.

2127
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:06,680
You have the greatest tattoo ever 
created for your chest.

2128
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:09,010
Yeah,
the ultimate big fish,

2129
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:10,250
little tits,
whatever.

2130
01:37:10,251 --> 01:37:15,251
You got kids.
You don't need to put ink on top of the 

2131
01:37:15,251 --> 01:37:15,251
tits.
Leave the tits alone.

2132
01:37:15,251 --> 01:37:15,270
Yeah,
it's.

2133
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:19,010
Leave me to have the chest tattoos and 
the handlebar mustaches.

2134
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:22,820
It's why you brought this up.
I have to write something down because I

2135
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:24,500
can't forget that.
Uh,

2136
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:28,410
I have to make fun of my friend Bill 
Burr for using,

2137
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:31,080
uh,
a Thomas Guide in 2012.

2138
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,790
One of those dudes like,
he,

2139
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:36,980
uh,
I loved the guys and awesome comedian,

2140
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:40,700
but he has a 1950 a,
a pickup,

2141
01:37:40,701 --> 01:37:45,701
I think it's got like the shifter on the
column on the column and he got no 

2142
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:51,791
navigation system.
He uses fucking Thomas Guides and he's 

2143
01:37:51,791 --> 01:37:51,791
like,
he's always joking around about it,

2144
01:37:51,791 --> 01:37:55,871
you know,
like using Thomas Guides know there's 

2145
01:37:55,871 --> 01:37:55,871
some people that refuse map.
They get it,

2146
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,000
they get a kick out of like ignoring 
antiquated to the level of difficulty.

2147
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:02,670
Yeah.
You know,

2148
01:38:02,671 --> 01:38:07,671
why people have maps because it was 
fucking hard trying to fucking follow 

2149
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:09,900
the Falcon as it went down the road.
And remember.

2150
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,960
No.
So we created a map and I ain't went 

2151
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:14,960
from a map.
And this is your bed,

2152
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:15,730
I think actually about the whole,
you know,

2153
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:20,750
and now you're going to go back to when 
you were living in some fucking dirt 

2154
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:21,570
hole when you discovered you had a 
bathtub.

2155
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:23,460
Right.
Look at how much of an advancement type.

2156
01:38:23,461 --> 01:38:24,180
This is wonderful.
I'm gonna.

2157
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:27,570
Have my baby in a bathtub and then you 
go from that and you have a hospital and

2158
01:38:27,571 --> 01:38:28,740
then now all of a sudden like,
no,

2159
01:38:28,741 --> 01:38:33,741
let's go back into a fucking hole full 
of mud and have a baby in that because 

2160
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:34,380
that's natural.
Yeah.

2161
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:39,380
Well that was me making fun of women 
want to have natural births like stupid 

2162
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:40,710
somebody else.
Yeah,

2163
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:42,150
no,
I've heard that.

2164
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,140
Oh,
that's his.

2165
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:45,030
Well,
it becomes a thing man.

2166
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:47,880
When you are around a bunch of people,
you kind of forget sometimes.

2167
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:49,800
Who was the one who said it,
but it made the.

2168
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:52,200
It's funny,
but it makes perfect sense.

2169
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:54,150
Like it's not,
there's nothing.

2170
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:55,190
Okay.
Having wine.

2171
01:38:55,191 --> 01:38:57,720
I have a natural childbirth in some way 
or whatever.

2172
01:38:57,721 --> 01:38:58,710
Like okay,
I can.

2173
01:38:59,110 --> 01:39:00,350
All right.
Yeah.

2174
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:03,380
I get it on a beat where the WHO has the
most likely chance.

2175
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:06,300
Exactly.
Died constantly all the time.

2176
01:39:06,301 --> 01:39:09,510
So now we have the ability to keep 
babies from dying.

2177
01:39:09,511 --> 01:39:11,250
So why don't we do that?
So it's the same thing.

2178
01:39:11,251 --> 01:39:11,820
Like,
okay,

2179
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:14,160
I understand using a thomas map or 
whatever,

2180
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:15,570
but that.
Sorry,

2181
01:39:15,810 --> 01:39:20,810
we have gps now and now if you have the 
Thomas guys because you're in case your 

2182
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:21,810
gps fails,
that's cool.

2183
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:24,960
Kids driving a three speed truck.
That's all right too.

2184
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:26,010
Like that's

2185
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:31,630
as long as you're aware of what you're 
dealing with.

2186
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:36,660
You're okay.
I just drove up here in [inaudible] 69 

2187
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:36,660
while barely drove up here in 
[inaudible].

2188
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:37,900
60 nine oldsmobile,
but I know what I'm dealing with and I'm

2189
01:39:37,901 --> 01:39:42,901
okay with that,
but I didn't drive up here with a 

2190
01:39:42,901 --> 01:39:42,901
fucking thomas map the whole time trying
to do this.

2191
01:39:42,901 --> 01:39:44,290
I used to have a 68,
four,

2192
01:39:44,291 --> 01:39:44,920
four,
two.

2193
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,930
Used to have a lot of cool shit.
I love that.

2194
01:39:46,970 --> 01:39:51,970
So do I bet back that back bumper and 
one of the greatest bumpers in the 

2195
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:54,250
history of automobiles,
that giant chrome shying bumper.

2196
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:58,810
That's one of the reasons why I have 
this kind of car because I had a 300 CSR

2197
01:39:58,811 --> 01:40:02,140
t a great car.
It had been rear ended twice,

2198
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:05,170
so I never got any wrecks until I got to
California.

2199
01:40:05,171 --> 01:40:06,370
I'm on the six.
Oh five.

2200
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:11,670
We get past this,
this fucked up traffic and I start 

2201
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:13,270
driving by and I see it fucked up car on
the right,

2202
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,650
which is why we're also,
I'm like,

2203
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:19,770
fucking California,
you just can't go a day without having 

2204
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:21,010
to run yourself into somebody else,
like just fucking morons.

2205
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:24,220
And we speed up and then started slowing
down and I'm like,

2206
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:24,970
ah,
fuck.

2207
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:30,320
I slow down,
stop and then right into my back.

2208
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:32,620
Wasn't paying attention,
of course not.

2209
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:35,320
And then they manage it,
fixed the car from that.

2210
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:37,930
It's all good.
I go and I pull the trim off,

2211
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:42,931
have all the chrome turned black and do 
all that and make the murder of the car 

2212
01:40:42,931 --> 01:40:43,210
looks awesome.
Okay,

2213
01:40:43,211 --> 01:40:48,211
cool.
I'm going to keep onto this for so many 

2214
01:40:48,211 --> 01:40:51,091
more years and then I'll finally get a 
new car and then I'm leaving at this 

2215
01:40:51,091 --> 01:40:51,970
place like 2:30
in the morning.

2216
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:56,180
It's been a good night for.
And I'm on beverly and last Deanna.

2217
01:40:56,181 --> 01:40:59,770
I just parked for four cars maybe ahead 
of me.

2218
01:40:59,771 --> 01:41:01,990
Is that a red light?
And I'm just chilling,

2219
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:09,120
like didn't even hit brakes.
There's a ranger just plowed right into 

2220
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:09,120
the back.
I mean,

2221
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:09,370
you just annihilates the back of my car.

2222
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,660
Was He texting?
I don't know what he was doing.

2223
01:41:13,661 --> 01:41:18,661
He wasn't drunk because the first thing 
I did is I got hit and at first I 

2224
01:41:18,661 --> 01:41:18,661
thought,
Oh shit.

2225
01:41:18,661 --> 01:41:21,710
It was a crazy boyfriend.
Hit me like crazy ex boyfriend.

2226
01:41:21,711 --> 01:41:22,360
Sorry.
No,

2227
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:24,020
it's not that guy.
Uh,

2228
01:41:24,021 --> 01:41:26,830
and his truck and I looked over and so I
see,

2229
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:29,110
I see.
I see a truck and I got.

2230
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:34,330
Well the first thing is doing all this 
fighting shit that I've been doing high 

2231
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:37,210
stress situations.
I know I have way better facilities than

2232
01:41:37,211 --> 01:41:42,211
your average person.
Even today I'm driving in the 

2233
01:41:42,211 --> 01:41:44,040
fascinating 75 miles an hour and there's
that wall on the one tab on the left 

2234
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:45,970
hand side of the concrete divider and I 
heard boom.

2235
01:41:45,971 --> 01:41:49,150
And it goes out and the car immediately 
tries to go into the wall.

2236
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,910
But I manage that by breaking the car.

2237
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:57,020
Um,
I'm applying brakes and feathering it 

2238
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:57,070
and steering the wheel and keeping it 
straight.

2239
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:58,690
I didn't hit a fucking thing,
you know?

2240
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:00,820
Oh yeah,
like a man,

2241
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:01,900
like a man,
like a man,

2242
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:06,901
Josh Barnett,
that once I wrote that ditch and I 

2243
01:42:06,901 --> 01:42:08,270
fucked it,
looked good and then ate it and then it.

2244
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:11,950
And then I became buffered and more 
sexually dominant.

2245
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:15,040
My prowess,
my sperm count went up so long.

2246
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:18,160
We've been doing this almost two hours,
an hour,

2247
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,800
45.
So I go and I get hit.

2248
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:22,510
Look,
I see the truck,

2249
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:25,600
first thing I do when to get out of the 
car and I jog over to where the truck is

2250
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:30,601
pulled over onto the side.
And then I noticed different truck come 

2251
01:42:30,601 --> 01:42:30,601
over,
take a look,

2252
01:42:30,601 --> 01:42:35,050
and I see these two dudes in the car and
they're like freaking out.

2253
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:35,770
Like,
oh my God,

2254
01:42:35,771 --> 01:42:36,690
fuck,
I can't believe I just did.

2255
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:41,690
I can't believe this.
They're upset about getting into an 

2256
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:42,460
accident.
Not Drunk at all.

2257
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,760
So we texted each other,
even one of the two,

2258
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:48,790
maybe both at the same time,
texting while blown each other,

2259
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:50,670
texting you about how good it felt to be
blown away.

2260
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,350
It's just so awesome.
Uh,

2261
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:56,680
so after that I'm like,
you know what?

2262
01:42:56,681 --> 01:42:59,950
I really liked the idea of having a nice
allsteel car,

2263
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,330
so like,
go ahead and run into this.

2264
01:43:01,331 --> 01:43:03,220
See how that's gonna work out for you.
That's true.

2265
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,140
That's one thing about those old cars,
man.

2266
01:43:05,141 --> 01:43:07,020
Naked.
Take a fucking hell of a wallop.

2267
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:12,900
You can smash into stuff and you know,
when I finally lose it and I just 

2268
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:13,360
started going Berserk on the freeway and
hitting people,

2269
01:43:13,361 --> 01:43:15,100
then this is going to be the vehicle to 
do it.

2270
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,070
It's definitely better than like a 
prius.

2271
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:19,490
Oh,
everything's better than,

2272
01:43:19,491 --> 01:43:20,470
than a fucking Prius.

2273
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:24,680
I assault you seen windows on the road 
tax.

2274
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:30,000
They're the worst because they can't 
even fit any luggage in the trunk 

2275
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:30,760
headache.
But I'm,

2276
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,860
I don't have anything against hybrid 
technologies or cleaner,

2277
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:38,650
safer burning stuff.
Fine.

2278
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,560
Cool.
With the rumble of the V eight.

2279
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:41,860
No,
no you can't.

2280
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:43,210
And,
and here's the thing,

2281
01:43:43,211 --> 01:43:45,100
like if you want to drive that,
go for it.

2282
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:50,140
You think you're saving the environment 
by creating a bunch of fucking shitty 

2283
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:50,140
batteries that are going to pollute 
something somewhere.

2284
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:53,390
Then all whatever minerals from Congo.
So,

2285
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,600
uh,
anything designed that it's all a 

2286
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,140
fucking scam.
It's not,

2287
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:04,940
there's,
there's been ways I'm sure that you 

2288
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:07,721
could have the most fuel efficient 
gasoline powered car that we have no 

2289
01:44:07,721 --> 01:44:12,671
idea because every one of those things 
has been shelved on purpose by the oil 

2290
01:44:12,671 --> 01:44:16,271
companies themselves because what good 
would it do to you to have to buy less 

2291
01:44:16,271 --> 01:44:18,670
gas is probably a car that can run on 
water running.

2292
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:20,200
So anyhow,
uh,

2293
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,600
etc.
These prius's and it's okay,

2294
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:28,601
but it has no soul hybrid cars have no 
souls whatsoever.

2295
01:44:29,121 --> 01:44:31,250
I've driven a hybrid car and I'm like,
well,

2296
01:44:31,251 --> 01:44:32,120
you know,
iT drives,

2297
01:44:32,121 --> 01:44:34,160
it's a car,
it's fine and does what it means to do,

2298
01:44:34,161 --> 01:44:39,161
but I feel like I'm in a soulless,
lifeless box and you sPend so much time,

2299
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:41,510
especially if you live in la behind the 
wheel.

2300
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:44,600
I want to drive something that makes me 
feel good about being in it.

2301
01:44:44,601 --> 01:44:49,601
That makes me get out of bed in the 
morning and go to get my car and be 

2302
01:44:49,601 --> 01:44:50,180
like,
god damn,

2303
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:52,510
if you were a chick I totally hit on,
you know,

2304
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:56,960
and that's a 69 old does that.
Well it's a grizzled girl,

2305
01:44:57,020 --> 01:45:01,200
I'll tell you that.
But she knows her way around the block a

2306
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,180
no,
she,

2307
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:08,030
she smoked a about 687,000
cigarettes in her life and you know,

2308
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:13,660
now she's,
she talks with some of those little 

2309
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:13,940
fucking microphone dailies in her neck,
but it's,

2310
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:19,000
you know,
it's got personality and the car is not 

2311
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:19,000
perfect and that's fine.

2312
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,930
You know,
it's mechanically sound and it runs 

2313
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:24,050
great and it's fun.
And trying to explain the appeal though.

2314
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:28,010
It's of like one of those having like a 
v eight engine.

2315
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:33,600
It has.
You turn the car over and it's got a 

2316
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:33,600
sound.
It's like,

2317
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,850
hey,
what's up here?

2318
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:35,630
Are you doing?
Where are we?

2319
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,280
What are we doing today?
What do you want to do?

2320
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,290
My run some shit over.
I want to go fast.

2321
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:41,570
What do you want to do now?
We could just hang out,

2322
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,000
just fucking get on the road.
It's completely different experience 

2323
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:47,690
that corolla,
even though corollas and french car come

2324
01:45:47,691 --> 01:45:52,691
get you where you want to go.
It's lacking that and this something 

2325
01:45:52,691 --> 01:45:53,690
that was captured in the creation of 
those cars.

2326
01:45:53,691 --> 01:45:57,260
These cars are steel and they're solid.
They're meant to last a very long time.

2327
01:45:57,590 --> 01:46:02,590
They are and there are touches in terms 
of comfort and of just style that are so

2328
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:06,800
stupid like you didn't.

2329
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:11,920
That's obnoxious.
The you didn't have to create little 

2330
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:14,231
emblems if some little fucker had to 
paint himself and then put them on the 

2331
01:46:14,231 --> 01:46:17,890
inside of the interior like no one's 
ever going to pay attention to half of 

2332
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:17,930
that shit,
but they did it anyways,

2333
01:46:17,931 --> 01:46:22,931
you know,
and they're like sinking the lights in 

2334
01:46:22,931 --> 01:46:24,381
in a certain way and having to put 
chrome around that bezel and going the 

2335
01:46:24,381 --> 01:46:27,521
extra mile,
the extra 30 of mile that is,

2336
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:32,360
you're not gonna get in a car nowadays 
and be in that kind of.

2337
01:46:32,361 --> 01:46:37,361
It's like going into those old buildings
and seeing all those touches that they 

2338
01:46:37,361 --> 01:46:40,211
put into the flooring,
into the mantles and you're getting 

2339
01:46:40,211 --> 01:46:44,051
that.
But in a vehicle you can tell the 

2340
01:46:44,051 --> 01:46:44,690
difference between factory just churning
out some,

2341
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:49,810
you know,
four wheeled immobile to get you 

2342
01:46:49,810 --> 01:46:51,461
wherever and somebody even a,
a factory line where people are putting 

2343
01:46:52,351 --> 01:46:52,950
these things together.

2344
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,890
Do you appreciate a technologically 
advanced cars?

2345
01:46:55,891 --> 01:46:57,390
Like,
like a nissan gtr

2346
01:46:57,460 --> 01:46:59,760
bruised in the godzilla.
Yeah.

2347
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:02,200
I think it's amazing that they can make 
over 4,000

2348
01:47:02,201 --> 01:47:04,710
pound car run that fast.
I don't think it's quite that heavy.

2349
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:06,780
I think it's 3,930
8:50.

2350
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:08,490
It's heavy.
It's very heavy.

2351
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,760
Four wheel drive,
zero to 60 in less than three seconds.

2352
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:16,960
It's crazy.
It's unreal or their car and then it'll 

2353
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,941
do it.
And in such a way that what my race or 

2354
01:47:19,941 --> 01:47:24,171
friends will telling me that almost any 
idiot can get behind the wheel of that 

2355
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:25,700
car and learned to be fast.
So I in fact in.

2356
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,420
So some folks were like,
don't get one of those.

2357
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:28,050
I'm,
well,

2358
01:47:28,051 --> 01:47:30,320
I'm like,
I'm not just sitting on a grant.

2359
01:47:30,321 --> 01:47:32,250
I'm going to go run out and buy a car 
with,

2360
01:47:32,251 --> 01:47:33,900
but okay,
why not?

2361
01:47:33,901 --> 01:47:38,901
And I go,
you're not gonna you're going to get 

2362
01:47:38,901 --> 01:47:38,901
bored.
You know,

2363
01:47:38,901 --> 01:47:38,901
it's going to be awesome.
It's going to this and that.

2364
01:47:38,901 --> 01:47:40,660
And then eventually it's like there's no
fun in this isn't it?

2365
01:47:40,970 --> 01:47:45,970
Doesn't need to be.
Well it doesn't scare the shit out of 

2366
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:45,970
you.
It doesn't come as everything.

2367
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:50,390
Yeah,
it does everything and does it all well 

2368
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:51,991
and it takes all the,
the efforts and a lot of the skills out 

2369
01:47:51,991 --> 01:47:54,070
of learning and adapting to a vehicle 
and it takes it away.

2370
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:55,240
Well,
you can take all that shit

2371
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:57,550
off.
You can shut off all that shit.

2372
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:02,580
You can shut off all that electronic 
control and treated like you're on a 

2373
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:02,580
race track and then it'll scare the fuck
out of here.

2374
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:04,360
You can go sideways on that car.
Oh,

2375
01:48:04,361 --> 01:48:05,200
I'm sure you can.
Yeah,

2376
01:48:05,201 --> 01:48:08,230
you just have to just shut off all those
stability system.

2377
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:08,320
Right?

2378
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:13,400
I love the car.
I think it's one of the coolest cars on 

2379
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:13,400
the road.

2380
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:13,400
It's almost ridiculous to get anything 
else.

2381
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:15,110
If you wanted to get a car that goes 
fast,

2382
01:48:15,111 --> 01:48:16,970
like that car,
not only is it go fast,

2383
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:22,120
it's like it's super tech.
It's like the most advanced 

2384
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:26,860
technological achievement as far as like
what we can do today to get you to go 

2385
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:29,360
fast and safe.
That's the most efficient

2386
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:32,490
a car that costs three times as much.
Right?

2387
01:48:32,630 --> 01:48:33,730
Yeah.
But then I,

2388
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:38,800
you know,
I was talking to somebody about the 

2389
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:38,800
difference.
There's okay that gtr will do it,

2390
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:43,241
but when you get in that gtr and you 
look around and it is comfortable and 

2391
01:48:43,241 --> 01:48:45,821
it's got everything you need or if you 
get in that ferrari or that all of a 

2392
01:48:45,821 --> 01:48:45,821
sudden things,
it's not okay.

2393
01:48:45,821 --> 01:48:48,860
The ferrari isn't maybe quite as fast or
maybe it's as fast,

2394
01:48:48,861 --> 01:48:53,000
but you look at the way it was put 
together in a way to let it remain.

2395
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:58,040
But hands.
I mean there's a huge difference there 

2396
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:59,380
and I would have trouble with a frog is 
I would love to get behind the wheel,

2397
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:03,200
which I've never done and drive the shit
out of one and treat it like,

2398
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:03,840
like,
like,

2399
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:06,100
like that.
It is totally true.

2400
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:07,900
She is all over.

2401
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:12,850
Yeah.
But uh,

2402
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,850
um,
it's too expensive.

2403
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:19,000
You just,
you do that and all of a sudden the bill

2404
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:21,160
shows up for changing oil breaks,
all that fun.

2405
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:23,260
And if you don't have the,
the,

2406
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:25,330
the nomenclature that says you had it 
all done,

2407
01:49:25,331 --> 01:49:29,490
then the value starts going down and 
like that's just too much fucking money.

2408
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:31,890
Which is also why I bought a sIxty nine 
olds cutlass.

2409
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:36,460
That is not a super special one.
It's not super pretty.

2410
01:49:36,461 --> 01:49:38,650
It's not perfect.
So when it gets dinged,

2411
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:41,470
oh well,
whatever.

2412
01:49:41,770 --> 01:49:46,770
Well,
that's one of the things I've always 

2413
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:46,770
said why there's something to be said 
for like a corvette zr one.

2414
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:48,010
It's like what they've done is just

2415
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,860
blown everything out of the water as far
as performance.

2416
01:49:50,861 --> 01:49:53,800
As far as zero to 60,
it's right up there with every other car

2417
01:49:53,801 --> 01:49:55,800
that's ever been made.
Zero $60.

2418
01:49:55,801 --> 01:50:00,801
Zero stops quicker than any car that's 
ever been made has got one of the most 

2419
01:50:00,801 --> 01:50:03,520
ridiculous norberg ring times,
but it's like,

2420
01:50:03,810 --> 01:50:05,360
no,
the interior is friends.

2421
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:08,740
Good,
but look.

2422
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,590
Okay,
put all that shit aside.

2423
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:13,170
The fuck it's or works right?
You hit that,

2424
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:15,670
that gas pedal,
that's a real engine bitch.

2425
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:20,790
That's a 638 horsepower va that.
That sounds like.

2426
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:24,970
Like like hell.
It sounds like the fires of hell

2427
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:29,160
world challenge a road racing for a,
for a scca.

2428
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:34,170
They have a team of a cadillac and all 
those fucking cts bees.

2429
01:50:35,190 --> 01:50:37,480
Those are ridiculous.
They start rolling around the crack.

2430
01:50:37,481 --> 01:50:39,340
They sound bad.

2431
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:41,000
Fuck yeah.
They just,

2432
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:43,160
they sound like even if they don't take 
first,

2433
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:45,550
they at least let everybody know that 
they were there.

2434
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,830
So beastly fucking car and if you,
those ctsv are ridiculous.

2435
01:50:48,831 --> 01:50:52,280
Like you can't believe you're in a four 
door sedan that's a cadillac,

2436
01:50:52,530 --> 01:50:56,180
you know,
and they were like 560 something fucking

2437
01:50:56,181 --> 01:51:01,181
horsepower essentially the same engine.
It's a deep tuned version of the zr one 

2438
01:51:01,181 --> 01:51:04,340
gesture and just hauling ass and you get
in a wagon so you just take your kids in

2439
01:51:04,341 --> 01:51:07,070
the back.
It shows the g force on a wagon.

2440
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:10,740
We live in an awesome time as far as 
what they're,

2441
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:12,250
what's,
what's possible too.

2442
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:15,790
I think so I think our cars have come to
such a different level.

2443
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:18,070
I love my,
my gt $500 [inaudible].

2444
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:23,160
It's such a bad ass car and my sponsors 
and everybody have helped me to make it 

2445
01:51:23,681 --> 01:51:25,060
even more gnarly.
Yeah.

2446
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:28,750
I have a gt 500.
I have a 2011 convertible.

2447
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,360
What do you think?
Fucking grave.

2448
01:51:30,361 --> 01:51:33,430
But he's just an amazing car.
It sounds so good.

2449
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,980
You could slide the tail out if you want
to.

2450
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:41,010
You know,
I mean it has some sort of traction 

2451
01:51:41,010 --> 01:51:41,890
control,
but it's a fucking live actual car.

2452
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,990
It's fun.
It's really enjoyable.

2453
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:49,050
Yeah.
Well I went and took all that enjoyable 

2454
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:49,050
thing and then turned it into like a 
murderer.

2455
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:52,960
So why put a whipple supercharger on it?
So it's 686 horsepower.

2456
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:55,930
I got kw and bmr for suspension.
They,

2457
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:59,320
I braced the whole fucking thing up and 
have coil overs all around.

2458
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:01,150
And the wider tires.
Not yet,

2459
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:02,540
but you're going to be.
Yeah,

2460
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,810
no,
a hrd is supposed to make the wheels for

2461
01:52:04,811 --> 01:52:05,710
a,
for the car.

2462
01:52:05,711 --> 01:52:10,711
I'm just waiting on somebody to step on 
the brakes because it's going to be in 

2463
01:52:10,711 --> 01:52:10,711
the optimal ultimate streetcar 
challenges.

2464
01:52:10,711 --> 01:52:12,160
Here I've got one piece,
carbon,

2465
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:17,180
uh,
one piece of aluminum drive line from 

2466
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:17,180
lethal performance and like all this 
different stuff.

2467
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:18,790
And uh,
I had somebody drive the car,

2468
01:52:18,791 --> 01:52:20,950
I took the rear seats out of it.
I pulled all the rivers,

2469
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:23,790
all the rear stuff out by this little 
deal set in a.

2470
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:26,600
I've got to put a roll cage in a,
uh,

2471
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:31,750
honestly.
And I'm still taking weight out of the 

2472
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:31,750
car.
And doing the thing,

2473
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:31,750
but it's still,
it's got the stereo in it,

2474
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:32,460
it's got everything.
It's.

2475
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:35,320
I put these amazing recaro seats in the 
front.

2476
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,270
Uh,
it's super comfy.

2477
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:42,570
But,
and I've got this magnaflow exhaust all 

2478
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:42,880
through these three inch pipes and I,
every time I turned the car over,

2479
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:45,380
I mean I know that my neighbors are just
like fucking rambling.

2480
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:50,810
Just a stock exhaust and the gt fIve 
fucking amazing.

2481
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:51,860
Now.
It's ridiculous.

2482
01:52:52,030 --> 01:52:56,450
It's one of the greatest sounds ever 
that the roar of a good va,

2483
01:52:56,710 --> 01:52:58,920
great exhaust.
And uh,

2484
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,980
I let I let this guy drive it and he 
goes,

2485
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,230
it's cars trying to murder you.
I,

2486
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:04,430
oh yeah.
Pretty much.

2487
01:53:04,431 --> 01:53:07,940
I tell everyone it's a 30 slash 30 car 
in 30 seconds to 30 feet.

2488
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:11,750
Some joe schmoe gets behind the wheel.
They've wrecked it because it'll just go

2489
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:16,751
out from underneath you.
It doesn't take anything to blow the 

2490
01:53:16,751 --> 01:53:17,090
tires on it.
Way too much power for those back tires.

2491
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:18,050
Right?
Well,

2492
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:19,520
kind of.
Well the suspension,

2493
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:24,730
honestly,
leaving a belt optima challenge last 

2494
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:24,730
year.
It's just watching.

2495
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:27,860
And I decided to go through death valley
instead of.

2496
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:32,950
And then meet up with the 15 so it was 
just stretches of just empty road and 

2497
01:53:32,950 --> 01:53:36,410
I've got this little problem right now.
I've got to sort that out.

2498
01:53:36,411 --> 01:53:39,020
So I like to put the car in limp mode so
I can't stop it.

2499
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:44,250
I can pull into stuff I pick,
it'll cruise at 140 flat as fuck.

2500
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:47,280
And if you go into a 55 mile,
an hour corner at 1:20

2501
01:53:47,281 --> 01:53:49,370
and just rolls right through it and 
comes right back out.

2502
01:53:49,371 --> 01:53:54,371
I mean this,
this suspension from kw and all the 

2503
01:53:54,371 --> 01:53:57,730
chassis embracing shift from bmr just 
has this thing rocked on the ground and 

2504
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:59,450
I took it to this guy out in west la.

2505
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:02,750
And Then this guy,
tom can't remember the name of his shop,

2506
01:54:02,751 --> 01:54:07,751
but at any moment you could have like 
$11 million with the cars all sitting 

2507
01:54:07,751 --> 01:54:12,100
around this place.
It looks like a dump and you don't even 

2508
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:12,780
know it's there.
But he's fantastic with doing suspension

2509
01:54:12,781 --> 01:54:17,781
and tweaking these cars out.
And they set it up for my weight and 

2510
01:54:17,781 --> 01:54:19,960
everything and dropped it and lowered it
and set all the suspensions.

2511
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:23,090
Your physical way because you're a 
heavier guy,

2512
01:54:23,091 --> 01:54:24,760
right?
So because you have to to,

2513
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:29,880
to adjust for that 250 pounds sitting in
the driver's seat and how that affects 

2514
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:34,730
suspension.
So do they have like an asymmetric 

2515
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:34,730
suspension?
Is that what it is?

2516
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:38,060
Like one side is like at a different 
height or something?

2517
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:43,540
Yes,
slightly to keep it basically is have 

2518
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:44,900
your fat ass sit in there and then 
fucking adjust to adjust.

2519
01:54:44,901 --> 01:54:47,540
And I take the measurements and then do 
the adjustments as need be.

2520
01:54:47,770 --> 01:54:49,360
And uh,
my cat,

2521
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:54,400
my buddy chris from kw and he works with
all the drift guys like dai yoshihara 

2522
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:58,190
and all them and sets their suspensions 
up and everything comes up with trick,

2523
01:54:58,220 --> 01:55:01,130
different ways of doing it.
What is the whole drift movement?

2524
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:06,131
What is that about?
Why do people like to go sideways and 

2525
01:55:06,131 --> 01:55:06,131
cars basically will one because it looks
cool,

2526
01:55:06,131 --> 01:55:06,710
right?
It does look pretty,

2527
01:55:06,711 --> 01:55:11,711
it looks fuckinG cool.
I think I would call drift the 

2528
01:55:11,711 --> 01:55:15,110
different,
like the combination of stunt driving 

2529
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:18,020
and racing because they have to go fast 
enough through it.

2530
01:55:18,021 --> 01:55:19,580
They've got to do,
but they've got a.

2531
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:22,910
It's not just about going sideways 
because they do it in those tandems,

2532
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:28,090
so the idea is like to try and match 
your and get as close and as tight into 

2533
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:31,040
any late.
The guys run in front of you as tight as

2534
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:33,380
possible without hitting him,
hitting the wall,

2535
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:38,500
hitting anything else,
and doing it as fast and as skillful as 

2536
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:38,500
possible.
So I look at it,

2537
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:41,930
I'm like,
it's just like a violent auto ballet.

2538
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:45,930
That's funny.
That's a funny way.

2539
01:55:46,430 --> 01:55:51,430
It's a really fun too.
So they've got like djs and it's like a 

2540
01:55:51,430 --> 01:55:51,510
huge party the whole day.
Long island auto belay,

2541
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:52,610
violent,
automatic.

2542
01:55:54,910 --> 01:55:57,720
How do they judge?
It's based on judge on a speed.

2543
01:55:57,870 --> 01:56:02,870
They look at the speed.
They look at how now they have these 

2544
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:04,851
clipping point things,
so they've got these lights that will 

2545
01:56:04,851 --> 01:56:04,851
monitor up if you get within a foot of 
them with your car.

2546
01:56:04,851 --> 01:56:07,710
So they measure how close you get to 
these clipping points.

2547
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:10,380
They also measure how closely you follow
the.

2548
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:13,260
You hit the right apex is in lines for 
the drips,

2549
01:56:13,261 --> 01:56:17,490
but also how closely and tightly you 
follow the guy ahead of you.

2550
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:19,950
The lead car in the fall and you're as 
the follow car,

2551
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:24,260
so a lot of crashes.
There's a decent amount of wacky stuff.

2552
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:25,250
Yeah.
ShIt.

2553
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:27,120
I mean,
but they're not catastrophic.

2554
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:28,290
But yeah,
they,

2555
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:33,360
they,
most of their body panels or title and 

2556
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:33,360
zip ties,
they just fucking rip right off.

2557
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:33,360
Oh really?
Yeah.

2558
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:38,180
On purpose.
We'll just so that because we have all 

2559
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:40,350
these fucking zoots fittings all over 
the place,

2560
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:43,110
locked in there and it gets torn.
No instead,

2561
01:56:43,111 --> 01:56:45,960
now just breaks it some little spot and 
falls off real easy.

2562
01:56:46,230 --> 01:56:51,230
So instead of tearing like a whole bunch
of fairing off of the car or something 

2563
01:56:51,230 --> 01:56:54,831
and just tears off a little,
like the bumper rips off and you can go 

2564
01:56:54,831 --> 01:56:55,000
ahead and fix that real quick and zip it
right back on again.

2565
01:56:55,150 --> 01:56:55,480
That's interest.

2566
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:00,740
So there's sort of like altered them to 
deal with the constant collision.

2567
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:05,780
Yeah.
Well and like there are some amazing 

2568
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:07,300
moments where someone's coming through 
a,

2569
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:09,610
uh,
come up against the wall and they're,

2570
01:57:09,611 --> 01:57:12,810
they're getting that back end out and 
they get so close with their back end,

2571
01:57:12,811 --> 01:57:16,020
hits the wall just enough to fold it in.
And when they come off,

2572
01:57:16,021 --> 01:57:17,190
it pops back out.
I mean,

2573
01:57:17,191 --> 01:57:19,480
that's holy shit dude.
You,

2574
01:57:19,481 --> 01:57:21,420
you literally ran your car into the 
wall,

2575
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:22,950
but just enough that it was still okay.

2576
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:24,750
Okay.
Well one day there's going to be.

2577
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:29,960
Every car is going to be like a gtr 
where everything is calculated to going 

2578
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:29,960
to see things coming in

2579
01:57:29,970 --> 01:57:34,970
except it's not going to go that fast.
And the governments can tell you where 

2580
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:34,970
to drive.

2581
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:35,070
That's going to be a real problem,
isn't it?

2582
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:36,570
You know,
I had heard something about,

2583
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:39,450
I don't know if this is a true story,
I never really researched it,

2584
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:43,830
but someone was really driving really 
fast on the highway and the cops,

2585
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:45,320
um,
called a,

2586
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,350
what is it?
Onstar.

2587
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:48,210
And they shut the car.
Is that true?

2588
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:49,530
Uh,
I think that is,

2589
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:51,390
is that really possible?
See,

2590
01:57:51,391 --> 01:57:56,391
that seems to me to be.
I'm not people getting aWay from the 

2591
01:57:56,391 --> 01:58:00,861
cops either,
but I am not also for the fucking 

2592
01:58:00,861 --> 01:58:01,380
skynet.
Shut your car off.

2593
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:02,790
Know that drives me nuts.

2594
01:58:03,230 --> 01:58:06,650
like if you have a problem,
there's one thing is to,

2595
01:58:06,651 --> 01:58:08,470
to,
to deal with the problem.

2596
01:58:08,471 --> 01:58:13,471
And then he is to take it so,
so much further that all of a sudden 

2597
01:58:13,471 --> 01:58:14,480
everybody's freedoms are impinged.
That's not okay.

2598
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:19,540
Yeah.
The fact that I'd rather have to deal 

2599
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:21,101
with cops chasing somebody down,
even if it ended up in my house getting 

2600
01:58:21,101 --> 01:58:24,731
ruined because of it.
Then having the big brother able to make

2601
01:58:24,891 --> 01:58:26,960
everybody do everything the way they 
want to.

2602
01:58:26,961 --> 01:58:29,750
Every time.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

2603
01:58:29,751 --> 01:58:31,370
And I was talking to this gal and she's 
going,

2604
01:58:31,371 --> 01:58:36,371
oh,
I would love it if cars start driving 

2605
01:58:36,371 --> 01:58:36,371
themselves.
So they were talking about that magnetic

2606
01:58:36,371 --> 01:58:39,521
system where they had the cars following
and traffic and stopping and slowing 

2607
01:58:39,521 --> 01:58:40,640
down and you know,
reducing accidents.

2608
01:58:40,641 --> 01:58:45,310
And I think safety is great,
but life is dangerous,

2609
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:46,210
period.
We don't,

2610
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:47,330
we die everyday.

2611
01:58:47,410 --> 01:58:48,810
That's part of the time.
Yeah.

2612
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:52,260
You know what cormac mccarthy talked 
about the,

2613
01:58:52,261 --> 01:58:54,490
the,
about everything is about games,

2614
01:58:54,650 --> 01:58:55,870
uh,
in this booklet and marine.

2615
01:58:55,871 --> 01:58:57,330
And then he goes on about how it's,
you know,

2616
01:58:57,370 --> 01:58:58,780
games,
men love games,

2617
01:58:58,870 --> 01:59:00,530
boys love games,
but what they love,

2618
01:59:00,610 --> 01:59:05,610
the thing about a game that makes it 
more important or less is what's at 

2619
01:59:05,610 --> 01:59:08,611
stake.
So war being the ultimate game because 

2620
01:59:08,611 --> 01:59:11,161
death is at stake if and that is the 
ultimate ultimate wager is life and it's

2621
01:59:13,181 --> 01:59:18,181
true.
If there was no consequences for the 

2622
01:59:18,181 --> 01:59:18,181
things that for a lot of the things that
we did,

2623
01:59:18,181 --> 01:59:20,260
there would be no that wouldn't have any
meaning.

2624
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:25,420
Of course getting into the ring and 
fighting somebody with no consequence of

2625
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:30,340
injury or death or whatever wouldn't 
wouldn't hold nearly as much interest.

2626
01:59:30,341 --> 01:59:32,800
It wouldn't have the same meaning behind
it.

2627
01:59:32,801 --> 01:59:37,801
And then it has to be very careful 
because the samurai fighting starts 

2628
01:59:37,801 --> 01:59:38,680
becoming really popular and do start 
actually sword fighting.

2629
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:41,400
Then people aren't gonna.
Watch mma especially.

2630
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:44,140
I think there's a whole collection of 
sword fighting videos right now.

2631
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:48,890
I think it's put as a boy with cox.
Oh yeah.

2632
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,860
Do you think that there's a.
That I could do?

2633
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:55,180
Well,
I dunno.

2634
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:02,280
Was like night of the warrior fighting 
with swords.

2635
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:07,980
Is that possible for us to go back down 
to like the romans and the christians to

2636
02:00:07,990 --> 02:00:09,410
the lions and all that stuff?
Not yet.

2637
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:10,970
Not yet,
but anything's possible.

2638
02:00:11,030 --> 02:00:11,510
Right?
I mean,

2639
02:00:11,511 --> 02:00:12,290
come on,
look it.

2640
02:00:12,590 --> 02:00:16,400
Look at the way that the government is 
today versus where it was saying,

2641
02:00:16,401 --> 02:00:19,490
and in the fifties or in the 19,
early 19 hundreds,

2642
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,000
it's much more intrusive by far our,
by far and,

2643
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:30,060
or just look at how radical tastes may 
change in terms of what content you'll 

2644
02:00:30,351 --> 02:00:33,470
see on television versus what you would 
see,

2645
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:36,860
let's say even in the most risky part of
the twenties and thirties.

2646
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,250
Technology of course,
always has a lot to do with that.

2647
02:00:40,251 --> 02:00:45,251
You know,
you have cameras and that anybody can 

2648
02:00:45,251 --> 02:00:47,711
use the shoe.
So of course it's much easier to make 

2649
02:00:47,711 --> 02:00:48,560
porn than it was back in when you had an
edison machine or whatever.

2650
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:50,850
Yeah,
you actually had a day.

2651
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:55,880
You gotta you gotta have a good strong 
arm and you gotta you gotta have 

2652
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:56,270
coordinates that jerk off and wind a 
wheel at the same time.

2653
02:00:56,690 --> 02:00:57,620
Uh,
but,

2654
02:00:58,190 --> 02:01:01,850
but look at if you just turn into 
regular advertising,

2655
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:02,920
I mean,
it's,

2656
02:01:02,970 --> 02:01:07,970
it's amazing that there are just men 
jerking off on corners everywhere they 

2657
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,440
go because there's so much sex being 
thrown at you all the time.

2658
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:11,670
The best way to sell.
And uh,

2659
02:01:11,710 --> 02:01:14,560
and how much we can get away with in 
terms of flesh and,

2660
02:01:14,850 --> 02:01:16,700
and provocative,
whatever and,

2661
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:19,730
and what.
And we see these things as being an,

2662
02:01:19,790 --> 02:01:21,440
I don't have anything against any of 
this,

2663
02:01:21,441 --> 02:01:26,441
but back in the thirties,
like people would have an aneurysm 

2664
02:01:26,441 --> 02:01:28,860
unthought of to see something like that 
and it just things progress.

2665
02:01:28,861 --> 02:01:33,861
Now.
Could things progressed to where people 

2666
02:01:33,861 --> 02:01:33,861
are really sort of fighting?
I don't know.

2667
02:01:33,861 --> 02:01:37,121
I suppose so.
And they have to have a few natural 

2668
02:01:37,121 --> 02:01:37,490
disasters.
People wanted to sword fight.

2669
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:41,630
Shouldn't they be allowed to?
I think if they choose to do it,

2670
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:43,020
if they choose to do it,
yeah.

2671
02:01:43,410 --> 02:01:44,440
If they choose to do it,
if,

2672
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:47,440
if people want,
they want the ultimate contests.

2673
02:01:47,970 --> 02:01:49,440
I mean,
it's not like if they don't do that,

2674
02:01:49,441 --> 02:01:54,441
they're gonna live forever.
There are temporary being if you choose 

2675
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:54,441
to go out that actually

2676
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:56,620
as a highlander,
I have to sword fight to live forever.

2677
02:01:57,070 --> 02:01:57,820
That's the only way,
right?

2678
02:01:58,330 --> 02:01:59,650
There can be only one.
Of course.

2679
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:01,430
Josh barnett.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2680
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:03,230
this is a bit of fun podcast,
dude.

2681
02:02:03,231 --> 02:02:04,970
Thanks for very much.
My pleasure.

2682
02:02:04,980 --> 02:02:06,560
Great to come back on.
Oh please.

2683
02:02:06,561 --> 02:02:07,580
Anytime.
Anytime.

2684
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:08,720
Definitely.
And when,

2685
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:13,760
so you said about three months before 
people can look forward to seeing you 

2686
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:14,390
very much before you can go back into 
training.

2687
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:17,470
Uh,
hard to say I got to follow up on friday

2688
02:02:17,471 --> 02:02:20,470
but I mean I've got good range of motion
in it but I do want to take,

2689
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:25,500
I know that that's going to take a 
little longer to cut this back open and 

2690
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:25,600
I don't like surgery.
I don't want to get cut open.

2691
02:02:25,601 --> 02:02:28,390
I don't want to go under but I just 
think in the long run it's going to be a

2692
02:02:28,391 --> 02:02:31,870
lot better.
So you have to do that soon and then you

2693
02:02:31,871 --> 02:02:33,690
have to recover from that.
Yeah.

2694
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:35,470
Yeah.
And you know,

2695
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:40,980
I,
I'm even looking into like there's like 

2696
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:41,680
what can they do for bone density,
you know,

2697
02:02:41,681 --> 02:02:44,290
nowadays and I mean this is my 
livelihood.

2698
02:02:44,291 --> 02:02:46,030
I need to make sure if this shit doesn't
happen again.

2699
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:51,540
What kennedy can you.
I was having online about micro wars 

2700
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,010
because there's any fucking.
I think so those kinda,

2701
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:56,180
those cannot punch just about anything 
there.

2702
02:02:56,200 --> 02:03:01,200
And there's like chinese iron palm 
techniques and these people work on it 

2703
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:04,921
and so it seems like it would condition 
your hands the war or those kinds of 

2704
02:03:04,921 --> 02:03:05,430
giant knuckles and it seems like that 
would help little.

2705
02:03:05,590 --> 02:03:10,590
I've seen documentary the duties.
He hits a little piece of steel 

2706
02:03:10,590 --> 02:03:12,160
everyday.
Fu dude is legit,

2707
02:03:12,161 --> 02:03:15,340
man.
The guy he doesn't feel to look at doing

2708
02:03:15,341 --> 02:03:17,410
something like that and like,
you know,

2709
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:22,740
what forms of calcium or whatever.
There was supposedly something called 

2710
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:22,930
forteo out there which was a bone 
density drug.

2711
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:24,970
Really.
They give it to us,

2712
02:03:24,971 --> 02:03:29,971
throw the women with osteoporosis with 
high a likelihood of fracture.

2713
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:35,550
Wow.
And it might be able to like a healthy 

2714
02:03:35,550 --> 02:03:35,710
person,
jack up your bone density I suppose.

2715
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:37,590
I mean,
the thing is we're losing bone density

2716
02:03:37,770 --> 02:03:38,490
day.
Yeah.

2717
02:03:38,491 --> 02:03:41,460
That is a problem with getting older,
with fighting the power man,

2718
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:42,610
fighting it.
Really

2719
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:47,850
every,
every cell that we have in our body is 

2720
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:50,970
constantly being attacked and they will 
degenerate over time and can't live 

2721
02:03:50,970 --> 02:03:51,280
forever.
But uh,

2722
02:03:51,630 --> 02:03:52,690
when you,
while you're here,

2723
02:03:52,691 --> 02:03:54,610
you'd like to be able to use it as much 
as possible.

2724
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:56,590
Holding noman 34,
34.

2725
02:03:56,591 --> 02:03:59,440
How much longer are you thinking of me 
throwing down so I can't tell.

2726
02:03:59,441 --> 02:04:01,930
You can't tell the fucking fucking.
Yeah,

2727
02:04:01,931 --> 02:04:06,931
bloody my hands for the last breath.
Be torn for me because as much as you 

2728
02:04:06,931 --> 02:04:11,521
fucking.
This isn't the only amount of time you 

2729
02:04:11,521 --> 02:04:11,521
have in your life to do this and 
fighting is me.

2730
02:04:11,521 --> 02:04:14,770
I am a fighting is absolutely a part of 
who I am,

2731
02:04:15,010 --> 02:04:17,040
violence,
a part of my life and that I'm.

2732
02:04:17,110 --> 02:04:20,170
I've got a lot more to me than that.
But being in the ring and being in war,

2733
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:21,060
that's what I'm saying.

2734
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:23,390
There's a lot of guys who say that and 
you go,

2735
02:04:23,391 --> 02:04:25,190
okay,
and do to keep convincing yourself.

2736
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:28,430
When you say that josh barnett is 
telling the fucking truth,

2737
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:31,400
that's exactly what you feel.
That's exactly what you mean when you're

2738
02:04:31,401 --> 02:04:32,460
saying it.
You're,

2739
02:04:32,490 --> 02:04:34,820
you're 100 percent committed and 
convicted to it.

2740
02:04:34,830 --> 02:04:35,230
It's a.

2741
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:37,440
And I told someone the other day,
I go,

2742
02:04:37,441 --> 02:04:38,070
when I go to the

2743
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,360
ring,
I'm already dead.

2744
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:41,910
I go to the ring is a dead person.
I have no feelings.

2745
02:04:41,911 --> 02:04:43,830
I have no emotions.
I don't care about anyone,

2746
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:46,590
I don't care about anything.
I don't care about my life anymore.

2747
02:04:46,591 --> 02:04:47,310
I don't have it.
I,

2748
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:50,170
I have a little set list of songs I 
listened to you in my,

2749
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:52,770
my hotel room before I go to and I,
you know,

2750
02:04:52,771 --> 02:04:55,440
like a couple tiers might fall from my 
eyes.

2751
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:58,290
I don't,
without out any sound,

2752
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:00,170
just you know,
just out of nowhere.

2753
02:05:00,171 --> 02:05:05,171
I just,
and I know that those tiers are for the 

2754
02:05:05,171 --> 02:05:05,400
life that I no longer own,
that it is gone.

2755
02:05:05,401 --> 02:05:10,401
I am dead now.
I'm more into my life and is no longer 

2756
02:05:10,401 --> 02:05:11,070
exist.
I am this,

2757
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:16,130
this is me right now.
I'm walking the life of a dead person 

2758
02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:18,120
and the only way to go is to go out 
there and let's go to the death.

2759
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:22,170
It's just I have nothing to lose because
I have nothing anymore.

2760
02:05:22,171 --> 02:05:23,550
There is nothing.
I feel nothing.

2761
02:05:23,551 --> 02:05:26,450
I care for nothing.
And in the middle of that,

2762
02:05:26,451 --> 02:05:28,640
it's going to be the most intense 
feeling of all time.

2763
02:05:28,641 --> 02:05:30,410
When you,
when you're in the middle of the cage,

2764
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:33,620
like your last fight,
the most recent will call me and you,

2765
02:05:33,650 --> 02:05:38,650
you guys are both throwing down and and 
you both had broken hands at that point 

2766
02:05:38,650 --> 02:05:42,491
in time.
It's got to be one of the most intense 

2767
02:05:42,491 --> 02:05:42,491
and realistic forms of struggle on her.

2768
02:05:42,491 --> 02:05:46,750
It is,
but unfortunately that's where it's 

2769
02:05:46,750 --> 02:05:48,440
great where your corner man can,
can give you that input to,

2770
02:05:48,470 --> 02:05:49,190
to,
to,

2771
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:52,940
to aim your direction because I got on 
there and broke my hand,

2772
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:56,990
made a couple fucked up a couple times 
in there and then all of a sudden I went

2773
02:05:56,991 --> 02:05:59,570
into fight to the death mode,
but it's not a fight to the death.

2774
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:02,810
It's a fight for five rounds.
If you don't finish it in five,

2775
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:07,190
chances are on those.
So I didn't really.

2776
02:06:07,191 --> 02:06:07,730
I mean,
yeah,

2777
02:06:07,731 --> 02:06:08,530
people looking at you like,
oh,

2778
02:06:08,590 --> 02:06:10,910
you're like blonde blood out of your 
nose and just,

2779
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:11,750
you know,
you're coming out.

2780
02:06:11,751 --> 02:06:14,150
People never stopped coming forward and 
trying to murder.

2781
02:06:14,151 --> 02:06:15,800
I'm like,
right,

2782
02:06:15,890 --> 02:06:20,660
but in front of three judges,
a referee and five rounds,

2783
02:06:21,290 --> 02:06:24,860
it didn't work.
So I got paid less.

2784
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:28,040
And you know,
think there's still a learning process.

2785
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:31,860
It is,
and I know it's,

2786
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:33,190
it's a,
yeah,

2787
02:06:33,191 --> 02:06:35,800
it is a learning process,
but I know that for me,

2788
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:38,500
being like that feeling that way,
that's,

2789
02:06:39,130 --> 02:06:44,130
that's there's days I feel like most of 
the time I feel like that's the way I 

2790
02:06:44,351 --> 02:06:47,110
really am.
That's when I get my strip off.

2791
02:06:47,170 --> 02:06:52,170
Everything that society has imparted on 
me and him and parts on me like pushes 

2792
02:06:53,141 --> 02:06:55,840
on and be like that.
I throw it all away and it to.

2793
02:06:56,070 --> 02:07:01,070
I tell you what,
feeling like your dead is pretty free.

2794
02:07:02,610 --> 02:07:07,610
You really feel free.
You've never appreciated life more when 

2795
02:07:07,610 --> 02:07:08,170
you've already given it away.

2796
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:10,430
It makes sense.
Yeah.

2797
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:14,630
That makes sense.
It's as intense as things can get.

2798
02:07:15,710 --> 02:07:17,210
There's no,
there's no other way.

2799
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:18,960
Right.
I mean that is as intense.

2800
02:07:18,961 --> 02:07:21,470
It's nothing other than actual war 
itself,

2801
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:23,660
you know,
there's nothing more intense.

2802
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:24,860
No.
And uh,

2803
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:26,310
it,
it also,

2804
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:27,120
I think,
you know,

2805
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:28,740
you start getting a bad.
It's like the,

2806
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,420
I'm gonna try and do something.
You just do it.

2807
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:32,430
If there's something that must be done,
you do it.

2808
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:33,780
You just do it.
And uh,

2809
02:07:34,270 --> 02:07:34,980
you can,
you don't,

2810
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:37,600
everything doesn't have to always be to 
the level of know,

2811
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:39,150
um,
you know,

2812
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:44,160
the walking dead and,
and I don't have any emotion or feeling 

2813
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:45,010
anymore.
I had a girl I was in love with,

2814
02:07:45,011 --> 02:07:50,011
break the living shit out of my heart as
soon as I had to go off over to Japan 

2815
02:07:50,011 --> 02:07:52,450
and I had pro wrestling matches to do 
and stuff and I'm destroyed inside.

2816
02:07:52,451 --> 02:07:56,500
I'm totally ruined and I'm giving press 
conferences and shit like that.

2817
02:07:56,501 --> 02:07:59,230
And you know,
they need to see a hero.

2818
02:07:59,231 --> 02:08:01,570
But inside I just feel like a piece of 
shit,

2819
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:06,600
you know,
I feel terrible and I'll go out there 

2820
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:06,600
and wrestle.

2821
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:07,930
Matt and I had a wrestling match in 
front of 12,000

2822
02:08:07,931 --> 02:08:12,400
people and make it look amazing.
And I did and we fucking,

2823
02:08:12,401 --> 02:08:15,290
we tore the house down.
But it was a,

2824
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:16,540
it was like,
you know what?

2825
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:21,600
You feel like death right now.
You feel like the lowest form and your 

2826
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:23,980
heart is so broken,
but nobody paid for that.

2827
02:08:24,490 --> 02:08:25,990
So it doesn't really matter how you 
feel.

2828
02:08:25,991 --> 02:08:30,991
Right now you have this in front of you.
And this must be accomplished and you 

2829
02:08:30,991 --> 02:08:33,700
can anybody make,
excuse you for cIrcumstances,

2830
02:08:33,730 --> 02:08:35,470
but that's.
No sorry.

2831
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:40,800
There really is no excuse.
there is only the result and only you 

2832
02:08:40,910 --> 02:08:42,370
know,
whether you do it or you don't.

2833
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:46,040
What's it like for you to see guys that 
you came up with?

2834
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:51,250
Guys like pedro,
his own that have reached pretty much 

2835
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:51,650
the end and you see the end and did,
do you,

2836
02:08:51,651 --> 02:08:55,130
uh,
do you take like a mental account?

2837
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:55,700
Dionte

2838
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:02,160
have there ever been training even 
because I'm tired of getting hit in the 

2839
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:03,570
head by fucking monsters that are in 
there.

2840
02:09:03,571 --> 02:09:08,571
And I just,
I know that part of the reason I tried 

2841
02:09:08,571 --> 02:09:09,730
to read as much as I do and I do want to
Be a more,

2842
02:09:09,731 --> 02:09:14,040
well everyday that I have a chance to be
a better person and learn more and be,

2843
02:09:14,070 --> 02:09:17,070
have a broader sense of this world at 
large,

2844
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:20,040
um,
is necessary.

2845
02:09:20,041 --> 02:09:23,280
It's important.
I think that's part of my,

2846
02:09:23,580 --> 02:09:26,190
uh,
not just right as a person to do so.

2847
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:28,420
But I think it's a necessity.
Like you,

2848
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:30,960
you should have to do that.
Uh,

2849
02:09:32,010 --> 02:09:37,010
but it's also the stable way,
the effects of that kind of shit of 

2850
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:41,540
dementia and whatever.
I mean I'm getting mad and practice 

2851
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,630
constantly and then I go in the ring and
get hit in the head some more and,

2852
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:44,640
and it damages your brain.

2853
02:09:44,730 --> 02:09:49,730
There's no way around it.
Some people are more susceptible to the 

2854
02:09:49,730 --> 02:09:52,640
side effects of it,
of catching pugilistic dementia and the 

2855
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:56,790
different becoming punchdrunk and,
but I know that there've been times 

2856
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:58,650
where I find myself trying to catch a 
word and I'm like,

2857
02:09:58,651 --> 02:10:00,600
I don't know why I can't think of that 
right now,

2858
02:10:00,601 --> 02:10:05,601
but that's maybe,
maybe it's because I'm getting hit in 

2859
02:10:05,601 --> 02:10:06,270
the head by eric prindle who's 300 
pounds,

2860
02:10:06,830 --> 02:10:11,830
but so why not just save it,
save that brain so that I can use more 

2861
02:10:11,911 --> 02:10:16,911
of it and even I'm still going to be 
getting hit in the head no matter what 

2862
02:10:16,911 --> 02:10:16,911
headgear I have on me.
But,

2863
02:10:16,911 --> 02:10:18,900
uh,
I don't want to take things to the point

2864
02:10:18,901 --> 02:10:23,901
where I've made a disability for myself 
mentally or physically with fighting.

2865
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:30,940
uh,
do you think you'll be able to discern 

2866
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:30,940
that?
I think I'll be.

2867
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:30,940
I think if I'm honest,
I will,

2868
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:31,890
um,
and,

2869
02:10:31,891 --> 02:10:36,891
but why watch guys like pedro can't take
a punch like he used to and part of me 

2870
02:10:36,891 --> 02:10:39,040
feels bad when you know,
I,

2871
02:10:39,050 --> 02:10:44,050
I do feel sad for that,
where they're at now compared to where 

2872
02:10:44,050 --> 02:10:48,761
they used to be,
but I'm also more so happy that they are

2873
02:10:50,091 --> 02:10:53,300
here on this earth,
loving their life,

2874
02:10:53,990 --> 02:10:58,400
still being able to exert themselves in 
the ring and be a part of this.

2875
02:10:58,430 --> 02:11:01,190
And if they decide to retire or when it 
comes to that point,

2876
02:11:01,191 --> 02:11:02,900
they need to retire.
That they did it,

2877
02:11:03,030 --> 02:11:05,090
that they had the opportunity to live 
that life.

2878
02:11:05,091 --> 02:11:10,091
They took those experiences into 
themselves and they can stand there in 

2879
02:11:10,091 --> 02:11:11,180
front of anybody and go,
I did this.

2880
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:15,170
I made my mistakes.
I had my success is I did this.

2881
02:11:15,171 --> 02:11:18,950
I did it with everything I got.
And you know what,

2882
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:21,590
you can't take any of that away from me 
ever.

2883
02:11:21,950 --> 02:11:23,360
It's all mine.
And I earned it.

2884
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:24,800
And that's beautiful,

2885
02:11:24,820 --> 02:11:28,960
powerful wisdom from josh barnett,
ladies and gentlemen.

2886
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:31,390
And with that note,
that's the end of this podcast.

2887
02:11:31,391 --> 02:11:36,391
The real end of this product.
This is the first time we ever did a 

2888
02:11:36,391 --> 02:11:36,880
podcast like this for folks listening.
this is gonna sound weird.

2889
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:42,060
A,
it might sound a little different 

2890
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:42,060
because we're using a totally different 
setup.

2891
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:45,151
We had a some sort of electrical 
shortage and brian got zapped in the 

2892
02:11:45,151 --> 02:11:46,460
face with a fucking lightning bolt,
but uh,

2893
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:48,360
yeah,
it was,

2894
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:53,580
it was white sparks,
too busy trying to run my car into the 

2895
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:54,700
fucking divider and wall on 1:10
north.

2896
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:59,760
Well,
there was a lot involved in making this 

2897
02:11:59,760 --> 02:11:59,760
podcast happened,
but it did happen.

2898
