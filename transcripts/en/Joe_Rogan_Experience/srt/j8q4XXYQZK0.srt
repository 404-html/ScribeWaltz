1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello Freak bitches,
but marijuana stays in your system

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:08,250
because it's fat soluble way longer,
like seven weeks.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,503
Whereas,
um,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,470
with coke it's a couple of fucking days.
I didn't tell you my marijuana story

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:17,310
when I came home from a dance club.
One night is right after it.

6
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:19,590
This before I started doing comedy.
He's living in Malden,

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,290
Granada highlands,
up on the hill there.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,230
Those are nice.
But yeah,

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,340
I come up in the palace,
a palace and Sagas.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,300
Yes.
We lived like a half a mile from it.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,770
Okay.
I come home,

12
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:30,180
my buddies all went out.
I come home,

13
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:34,250
Shit faced is the thing that tomato
sauce and it's like one in the morning

14
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,510
and I'm starving.
I make spaghetti.

15
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,730
I eat enough for like five people.
Okay.

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,190
I wake up like an hour later and my ears
are ringing in the rooms going like

17
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,570
this.
I started puking,

18
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:46,620
puking,
violently.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,330
I hit my buddies,
come in,

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm in the bathroom.
I hear them go into the kitchen.

21
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:52,170
They go,
he ate all the fuck.

22
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,030
They made Rasta Pasta loaded with and,
and they,

23
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,210
they ate this much of it.
They said they like a,

24
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,110
you know,
a tiny amount,

25
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:05,310
they will fucked up all night and this
is a guy who I only get high at that

26
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:08,670
point a couple of times in my life and
that now my roommate's talking to me.

27
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,320
Right.
He's right where you at?

28
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:13,020
He's like five feet away,
but it sounds like he's yelling from a

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,360
mile away.
I was tripping on the fucking they were

30
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,620
going to take.
They didn't know if they should take me

31
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,510
to the hospital,
not fucking puking.

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,230
I'm swearing at him and,
and,

33
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,310
and honest about it.
It was a week later,

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,680
I remember watching the superbowl and
still being fucked up

35
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,220
because it's so,
like you just said when you went,

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,610
when you ingested orally,
it's way stronger and,

37
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:33,360
and,
and it,

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,650
it little reason my system.

39
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,860
I don't know how long.
I mean,

40
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:36,750
you know,
you can look it up,

41
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:38,490
but I,
and this is from somebody who didn't.

42
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:40,590
I didn't smoke a lot of weed.
That's crazy.

43
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,980
Week later.
Oh,

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,160
at least a weekly.
No,

45
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,420
at least I'm probably being conservative
with that because it stays in.

46
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,740
If you saw how much I ate,
you know,

47
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:54,741
if you saw how much tomato sauce,
such a grease ball and,

48
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,060
and uh,
and they will like,

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,040
they will fucked up all night with this
much and they were like,

50
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,200
oh no,
you're making of the fingers like a

51
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,570
hockey puck.
Forget I'm not on TV.

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,760
But yeah,
about half the size of a hockey.

53
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:07,170
But I was sitting there like,
you know,

54
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,260
and my ears were ringing and they would
like I said,

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,190
my roommate's like that close to me and
it sounded like he was yelling down the

56
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:14,850
hallway.

57
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,020
It's interesting because as we talk
about this and we've talked a lot about

58
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:20,790
the damage guys,
because we've gone through all the

59
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,410
various techniques,
you know,

60
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,800
after you had,
you know,

61
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,610
a discussion with Brendan Schaub.
A lot of people came out and they

62
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:27,151
started saying,
hey,

63
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,700
should we feel bad for talking about
this sport?

64
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,650
And I,
and I've heard that conversation again,

65
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,080
you know,
at what point should we feel guilty for

66
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:37,200
watching guys?
We know our aging fighters and you know,

67
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,730
you could do the same thing with
football.

68
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,340
You can certainly do the same thing in
the military where there there's a lot

69
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,440
of traumatic brain injuries taking place
in the military as well.

70
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,930
One thing that I think people forget in
that I think people need to understand.

71
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,180
It's not to excuse anything or take away
from the conversation.

72
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,850
It's,
it's a little bit of a mitigation.

73
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,150
The,
the men and women who do sports like

74
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:59,200
this,
if you take it away from them,

75
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,990
they're going to find it elsewhere.
I mean,

76
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:02,920
it's,
it's a need.

77
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,980
You know,
for a guy like me had I not found mixed

78
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:08,380
martial arts,
I was going to find something.

79
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,101
There's,
there's like,

80
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:13,600
there's drive inside us to do something
extreme that makes people raise their

81
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,760
eyebrows and say,
are you sure you want it?

82
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:18,420
You really are going to do that.
They have that,

83
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,310
that desire,
and it's just a personality trait.

84
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:21,850
I mean,
if,

85
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,880
if mixed martial arts didn't exist,
I mean look at cowboy cerrone,

86
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:29,530
the things he does to,
to fill that hole in his life and you're

87
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:32,200
going to get a lot of guys.
That's why guys don't want to retire.

88
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:35,170
It's just part of who they are.
We all know the risks.

89
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,960
We all know everything we're up against.
We still sign the contract,

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,400
and so it's important to remind them
that if you know for people that are

91
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,740
anti this and anti that,
you know,

92
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,630
we're going to do something like that
anyways,

93
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:49,090
we're going to find something else to do
and at some point we've got to be

94
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,110
accountable for our own actions.

95
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,270
Well,
there's a wide variety of human beings.

96
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,270
There's always going to be sedentary.
People that sit in their couch is going

97
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,670
to be people who want to fucking rock
climb with no ropes.

98
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,740
My friend already went back to the flip
phone.

99
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,240
He goes,
no,

100
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,980
our fear stand up.
Comedian,

101
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,640
he defended his iphone and went to a
flip phone,

102
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,920
went off.
He does all of his social media stuff

103
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,220
either on a computer or not.
He doesn't check his twitter on his

104
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,054
phone.
His.

105
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,520
He's like,
I was getting too wrapped up in like I

106
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,240
would be talking to someone that goes to
this guy.

107
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,243
I want to finish

108
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,850
sleep last night on like literally the,
my iphone hit my forehead three times

109
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:25,140
and I finally gave up because I was
like,

110
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:26,840
what the fuck am I going to post?
Yeah,

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,100
another concussion,
you know,

112
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,240
I'm like,
I'm looking at.

113
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,280
I don't think it's spelled correctly and
it's probably like a bunch of weird

114
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:34,580
wingding character or something that
brings me back.

115
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,090
So what I was going to say is like
there's,

116
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,310
there's,
there's something about iphones that

117
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,420
drag people in,
right?

118
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:45,060
There's something about like being able
to look at videos and you're,

119
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,670
you're interacting with your phone.
Yeah.

120
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,060
The interaction that you get with those
old cars,

121
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:52,280
the field that you get,
the addiction that you get to get in

122
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:54,950
those things is very different than the
new cars.

123
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:57,320
And is there.
And I wanted to ask you this because

124
00:04:57,321 --> 00:05:01,400
you're the expert on those older cars,
but is there like a point where it

125
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,370
crosses this line and it's not the same
experience anymore?

126
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,150
And was there like a sweet spot in the
production of cars?

127
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,440
Whereas we're there a spot where all the
technological advances and all the

128
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:15,650
advances of suspension,
although they may allow you to get

129
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:17,330
around a race track a little bit
quicker,

130
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:21,290
especially with like PDK transmissions
with dual clutch is working at the same

131
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,660
time.
They do allow you to get places faster,

132
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:28,100
but is it,
is it missing all the stuff that gets

133
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:32,120
people excited about cars.
I mean because I know that driving an

134
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:35,720
automatic car is fun.
It is satisfying,

135
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:40,721
but I also know it's not as satisfying
as shifting your own gears as the field

136
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:43,040
that you're going to get from a car like
yours.

137
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,130
And I think that that's something that's
missing.

138
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:50,390
I think ultimately moving forward the
manual may become a lost art because you

139
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,810
love kids growing up today that don't
know how to drive manual cars.

140
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:58,030
So the point of reference is completely,
you know,

141
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,360
most of us here I think learn driving a
manual car and everything that you said

142
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,750
is perfectly true.
That a see interaction between man and

143
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,870
machine,
which gets you down the road differently

144
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,480
in a manual than what it does in a new
car.
