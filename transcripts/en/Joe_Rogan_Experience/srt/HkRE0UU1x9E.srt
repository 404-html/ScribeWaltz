1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,960
The joe rogan experience and this
extreme lack of empathy though the lack

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:09,030
of empathy towards anyone who doesn't
share your position.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,760
This is very strange.
It's um,

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,960
it's very,
it's piss poor thinking and it's

5
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:16,794
everywhere

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,210
and in everyone wants to feel like not
being a part of one of the tribes is it

7
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:26,410
extremely lonely position and you get
called all the bad names because people

8
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:29,800
want you to be a part of their tribe and
people don't want to be called bad names

9
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:33,040
and they want to feel like they're are
any name group hug emotionally.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,640
I totally got that.
Yeah.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,220
Kind of sucks being homeless.
Well it's just politically homeless.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,810
Yes.
It's just when you got a president

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,840
that's so polarizing and you have an
opposition to him that's so there,

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,720
there,
there's so much momentum in opposing him

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,670
and I think this is a giant wedge in
between these two sides.

16
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:01,510
And then you have that hat and that hat.
If that kid wasn't wearing that hat,

17
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:04,300
a guarantee and be like 20% less hate,
it would be.

18
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,630
It would be people would still get mad
at him because he was still like,

19
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:11,080
I've seen people say when a native elder
walks up to you and he's banging his

20
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:13,150
drums,
get the fuck out of the way.

21
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:14,080
I saw that.
Like,

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,930
come on,
you can't expect that you what?

23
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,240
You can't just beat your drum.
First of all,

24
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:22,090
he got right in the kid's face like
inches from the kid's face.

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,630
Pretty amazing.
The restraint this kid had to just smile

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,610
and the idea that you're going to judge
this kid millions and millions and

27
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,900
millions of people going over this right
now.

28
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,470
That kid woke up that morning,
he had no fucking idea.

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,840
He was a kid in a cult.
Okay?

30
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:42,160
He's in a Catholic cult school and he's
going to some weird thing,

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,920
some march for life where people are
trying to kill babies.

32
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,300
We've got to stop him from killing
babies,

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,370
right?
And he goes there and there's this black

34
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:52,120
Israelites calling them the faggots and
there's these all these people calling

35
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,370
them names.
And then all of a sudden this guy's

36
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:56,500
beating the drum in front of his face
and we're supposed to,

37
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,320
we're supposed to docsis kid now cause
he smirked.

38
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,850
[inaudible] that's a crazy,
an impossible lack of empathy.

39
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,300
It's impossible to defend like unless
you hate boys,

40
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,930
unless you hate all boys because boys
are dumb like 16 year old boys are

41
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,850
almost universally dumb.
They all,

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,450
they all grow up to be men.
Some of those men will be your best

43
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:19,890
friend.

44
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,320
So when those men will be amazing,
some of those men you be so happy to see

45
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,760
when you see him,
you'll give him a big hug.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay lets me write me.
I was a stupid fucking 16 year old and

47
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,190
I'm a man now and I try to be as nice as
I can to everybody.

48
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,920
I go way out of my way to be a kind
person.

49
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,920
That could be that kid too.
Like what you're doing is not good for

50
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,180
anybody.
It's not,

51
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:43,870
it's not good for society to take this
trend and run with it.

52
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:44,621
And this is,
well,

53
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:45,910
this is what people do now

54
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,080
we're coming home from a Christmas
extravaganza,

55
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,000
which I do with my buddies every year.
Right before Christmas,

56
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:55,140
we get a big card pile in and we'd go
Christmas shopping for our families.

57
00:02:55,141 --> 00:03:00,141
And what have you coming home loaded?
I supposedly threw a burrito from taco

58
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,910
bell or something and hit the guard.
So there's four,

59
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,710
three or four of my buddies.
We get to my house,

60
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,410
we pig out on Shitty Taco bell food,
you know,

61
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,340
until everybody passes out.
And the next thing I know the cop lights

62
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,720
are,
are banging on the door.

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,590
Get out of here.
I'm,

64
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,550
I come to the door.
God,

65
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,673
Hey,
why?

66
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,200
You know,
after you've been drinking it,

67
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,860
he'd do a bunch of food.
You're fucking gone.

68
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,800
And uh,
so long story short,

69
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,970
they said,
well,

70
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,360
you're going to be arrested for assault
if you don't go down and say you're

71
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,500
sorry to this guy saw what?

72
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,790
A burrito.
Correct.

73
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,150
Right.
And by the end.

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,070
So if you charge a man with a salt,
because he throws a Burrito at you,

75
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:41,170
you should,
you should turn in your card.

76
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,350
But we were to tape,
it was not like throwing it at him.

77
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,600
It's not like I've barely with a
baseball right here.

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,240
I like chunked it to him to eat,
but he didn't see it coming and so it

79
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,600
like slapped him and fell down.
So they cuffed me,

80
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,360
they take me down to the guard house.
Yeah,

81
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,520
they put me in the back of a cop car.
Kofi cops.

82
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,800
These are real ones.
Oh really?

83
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,990
Yes.
He filed a report and a,

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,510
so this is how stupid it gets shaped by
then.

85
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,190
I'm so fricking loaded,
right.

86
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,920
And I get there and the Burrito is still
on the ground,

87
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,620
like it's evidence or some shit.
And they're telling me,

88
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:15,100
I gotta apologize to this guy and all I
can focus on is there's a perfectly good

89
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,060
fucking burrito round here.

90
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,920
I'm going to eat this burrito.
So I sit down and literally start eating

91
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,780
the Burrito God.
And you're like,

92
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,660
please just tell him you're sorry.
So you go back home and I'm like,

93
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,950
okay.
So I tell him,

94
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm sorry,
I'm still eating a Burrito and they just

95
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,410
left me there like a mile from my house
at the guard shack.

96
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,210
You walked home with mild drunk,
a man named Mr John.

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,250
My wife and I own barber,
so people don't know.

98
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,860
We own these things called the shea
washing room shops.

99
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:44,500
We have one at state farm arena that one
of the Atlanta Hawks play.

100
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,820
We have our flagship store on age with
avenue.

101
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,230
Edgewood avenue was once an Auburn
Avenue.

102
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,860
Well wants to sinners of black Atlanta
in terms of commerce and retail and

103
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,950
money.
Atlanta life insurance company with the,

104
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:58,600
are you guys google?
Some of this stuff is big time shit.

105
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,310
You know,
this isn't the old narrative of we've

106
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,320
never had nothing cause that's not the
truth.

107
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,990
And Landon was a very rich city for
African Americans.

108
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,550
Still is on this street,
used to be owned by African Americans.

109
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:12,070
The storefronts in there,
their children.

110
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,700
After these people died off,
sold the buildings off and sold it for

111
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,890
cheap.
And I know this because a man named Mr

112
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,170
John who runs a grocery store,
they're stopped me one day.

113
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,640
He said,
you know Michael,

114
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,730
after we're gone and this neighborhood's
been gentrified and everything's

115
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,410
different,
they're going to come along and say that

116
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,290
white people stole this from us.
And he said,

117
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,800
that's not true.
He say the children or the people that

118
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:40,060
were here left and they never came back
because they didn't think what they

119
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,340
parents built was good enough.
Oh man,

120
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,070
to kill me because that not just black
people,

121
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:50,040
that's Americans period.
We have gotten to a point where we are

122
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,450
on appreciative,
we are entitled,

123
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,540
and we don't think what happened before
us was good enough.

124
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,860
So we don't treasure it.
We don't honor it.

125
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:58,160
We don't

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,460
reinvest in it.
That could be a farm in Milledgeville,

127
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,600
that could be a house in Adamsville,
but we have to do a better job of

128
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,460
appreciating ourselves,
appreciating our community and in

129
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:11,450
appreciate now greater community and you
have to reenter.

130
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,720
You have to reenter fi day.
You have to be a part of whatever

131
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,470
gentrification happens to make sure that
your stake is still there and that what

132
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:21,530
you care about from a morals and civil
perspective represented there.

133
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,090
I've known Bobby Lee for 20 plus years.
He's never put out a comedy special.

134
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,730
That's insane.
Yeah.

135
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,110
Bobby Lee almost got me killed at a
strip club in San Diego.

136
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,310
First Time I met him.
I already believe it be continue.

137
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,700
We were in our twenties and uh,
and uh,

138
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,020
uh,
I met bobby laid down there at the La

139
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,540
Jolla comedy store and then we went out
after the show,

140
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,180
this is probably like 90,
late 90 somewhere.

141
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,500
And we went out afterwards,
went out to the Strip club and there was

142
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:54,190
this Mexican gentleman with a tattoo on
his face in the 90s,

143
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:56,710
which is rare.
And he had long,

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,930
straight black hair.
Wow.

145
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,150
And he had a look in his eyes like,
he's killed people.

146
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,940
I'm a good,
I'm a,

147
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:06,670
I'm a good at sniffing out danger.
I'm like,

148
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:08,560
that's real danger.
And Bobby was hitting on,

149
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,720
his girl was trying to get a lap dance
from his girlfriend.

150
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Got in Bobby's defense,
it's at a strip club,

151
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:17,500
but this girl was apparently his
girlfriend at a strip club and Bob and

152
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,240
uh,
the guy stood up,

153
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,100
you know,
and he stood up and he said something to

154
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,840
bobby and bobby comes over and he's
like,

155
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,180
fuck that guy.
And I looked at the guy,

156
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,930
looked at Bobby,
I'm getting out of here right now.

157
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,370
And he's like,
either I go,

158
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:29,410
you should come with me or you're going
to walk home.

159
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,273
I'm like,
fuck you.

160
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,600
I go,
I'm not getting killed for,

161
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:34,660
you know,
we all ran out into the car and I had a

162
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:38,440
Toyota super at the time and I got in my
car and bobby was like,

163
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:39,520
that guy ain't gonna do shit.
I'm like,

164
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,460
cat in the fucking car.
I'm like,

165
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,020
dude,
you don't understand danger.

166
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,390
You're going to get everyone killed.
It's guys like you.

167
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,550
Yeah.
He told me a story once about a,

168
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,593
he,
he's,

169
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,500
he's at mad TV.
They had a table read and uh,

170
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,010
he hadn't slept in a couple of days.
He'd just gotten back from Mexico.

171
00:07:57,011 --> 00:08:00,190
He had a giant bowie knife,
like tucked into a shirt.

172
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,070
And it was fucked up on pills and he was
just sweating.

173
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,000
They been up for days and he's at the
table read.

174
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,430
And that was before he decided to clean
his act.

175
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,330
Yeah,
I was lucky enough to come across like,

176
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,250
well,
after those days,

177
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,720
uh,
and we,

178
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:18,090
they wrote,
they wrote a script to fuck with him.

179
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,450
They gave him the wrong script.
We'd like extra lines with a monologue

180
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:24,240
that took up like the whole page so that
he would have to remember it.

181
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,671
We know.
No,

182
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,450
he just had her read it and everyone's
like,

183
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,380
like jen cheap.
They tell everybody like,

184
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,970
don't worry about that part where he
thinks he's a bird.

185
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,510
And so bobby's like,
I'm a burden.

186
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm supposed to.
And like the writer was coaching.

187
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:35,340
I'm just like,
do the wackiest bird boy.

188
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,790
And he's like,
God supposed to fly coach and I'm a

189
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,730
burden and he looks up and we're crying,
laughing,

190
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:44,250
and he see someone scream,
fuck you got any through the script

191
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:46,140
across the room.
And I remember just taking pictures of

192
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,003
yeah,
just to,

193
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,650
they just did it on his birthday or
something to mess though.

194
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:53,130
It was like the best prank.
Trump kept calling jeb bush low energy,

195
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,230
laying on the couch going,
that's fucking me.

196
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,064
He's talking about,

197
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,060
I'm laying on the couch and I hear about
somebody dying in an avalanche.

198
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,830
You know,
I watch it on t and I laugh because I

199
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:05,070
wouldn't have a fucking be dropped off
in a helicopter at the top of a mountain

200
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:08,940
to go snowboarding and then they die.
I'm laughing my balls off eating a bag

201
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,541
of chips.
Well,

202
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,180
the one person,
he's never called anybody anything is

203
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,620
Nancy Pelosi.
And people like,

204
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,450
why hasn't he come up with a nickname
for her yet?

205
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,050
Yeah.
You know,

206
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,370
cause you can't say content that's going
to cost him the election.

207
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,970
That will cost him about 2020.
Greg Fitzsimmons had a joke about that.

208
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,360
He's like,
it's countdown until trump,

209
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,770
that sick ankle dog face.
That's what I call Hillary,

210
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:34,520
adding the calorie count.
Uh,

211
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,530
what,
what,

212
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,660
what kind of a nickname,
if you were going to help him,

213
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,880
like if he hired you like nick,
hello.

214
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,190
See,
I need a solid republican comic to help

215
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:44,410
me with my one liners.
What do you think?

216
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,780
Uh,
well I call her on my show for her.

217
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,693
The,
uh,

218
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,920
uh,
the leathery nippled.

219
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,170
Hmm.
That's too pretty good luck catching her

220
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,710
day like a lion,
ted.

221
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,460
Okay.
Yeah.

222
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,250
Fucking naughty.
Nancy.

223
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,260
What did he call Hillary?
Crooked Hillary.

224
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,780
Crooked Hillary.
Lying Ted.

225
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,810
How Bout Energy Jeb?
How about a yeast infection in heels?

226
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,251
No,
no,

227
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:11,084
no,
no,

228
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,083
no,
no.

229
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,630
How about lying liberal?
Mm.

230
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,940
Lubbock stick.
Do you know that she's worth $100

231
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,241
million?
Yes,

232
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:22,670
I do.
The little people job.

233
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,510
She represents the working class.
You know,

234
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:28,670
she has fucking walls around our
matching.

235
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,310
Meanwhile,
people laying their own feces in San

236
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,420
Francisco.
Well,

237
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:34,160
that Laura loomer check the chick that,
uh,

238
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,760
handcuffed herself to twitter.
She hopped Nancy's fence and he started

239
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,594
setting up,
uh,

240
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,670
like uh Oh,
I grin camp nancy slot.

241
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,340
Did you see that?
What happened?

242
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,870
They kicked her out.
What was the result?

243
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,670
Illegal.
She's doing something illegal.

244
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:49,420
She's trespassing.
I would say Denat I'll be outside of

245
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,740
house gone.
This fence has a moral mm,

246
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,950
right.
Build that wall or don't I also like the

247
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:56,840
wall still,
but when we have a machine guns and

248
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:59,550
tanks and flame throwers,
like I took them,

249
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,050
you don't have to kill.
I'm serious about this.

250
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:03,940
You're going to laugh.
Okay.

251
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,830
Cause uh,
you don't have to.

252
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,360
But Sarah,
I love how we rule out lethal force as

253
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,700
far as protecting our board.
That's not even on the plate.

254
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,860
So I,
okay.

255
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:18,730
It's too many levels to pick somebody
off as they're climbing over,

256
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,050
but okay.
You something less lethal.

257
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:25,410
A supersoaker Filbert cat piss
or the,

258
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:34,950
okay.
