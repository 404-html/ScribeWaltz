1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,820
Her low freak bitches and I did my first
marathon in 2002 so I've been doing

2
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:08,110
this for whatever,

3
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:09,070
14 years.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,253
Um,

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,540
multiple marathons
every year back to back.

6
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,660
Sometimes my body is not 100%,

7
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,850
so I can push,

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,980
I have a high high pain tolerance,

9
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:22,210
but eventually,

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,403
um,

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,730
it adds up.

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,830
And so it's pain for me.

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:28,960
Is this,

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,140
who was a joint pain?

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,831
Knees,

16
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:31,251
everything.

17
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:32,420
Is it just the whole body?

18
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,700
It's waste down,

19
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,563
hips,

20
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,703
knees,

21
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,430
ankles,

22
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,070
feet.

23
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,450
And how long does it take you to recover?

24
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:42,930
Like you were telling me that your legs
were swollen twice the size of normal.

25
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,291
Yeah,

26
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,124
last year.

27
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,390
Last year was way worse.

28
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,770
This year I had,

29
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,740
I've put in a bunch of miles leading up.

30
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,660
I was running about a
half a marathon a day.

31
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:56,040
So my body was pretty fit
and pretty used to it.

32
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,290
So my recovery was much shorter.

33
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,124
I mean I,

34
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,390
and again

35
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,480
people aren't going to understand this,

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,310
but the next,

37
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,370
the day after I ran 102 I ran 13 miles
and that was just because when I run the

38
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,980
big foot 200 I'm going to have
to be able to come back after,

39
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:14,760
you know,

40
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,760
multiple days of being hurt and banged
up and that's the name of the game,

41
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,640
you know,

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,450
to cover 200 miles and a
couple of days like I want to,

43
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,920
I'm not going to be 100%
so I thought well I can't,

44
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,070
I can't know what it feels like to run
after I run a hundred miles unless one I

45
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:39,210
run a hundred miles and
two I run the day after.

46
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,100
So you can't simulate that.

47
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,270
There's no way to simulate that.

48
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,690
So you ran 13 miles a day
after you run 102 miles,

49
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,950
what the fuck is that like?

50
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,540
Uh,

51
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,550
it'd be using the running term loosely.

52
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:52,050
It was painful.

53
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:52,884
Slow.

54
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,010
I was hiking the up hills
running would be like,

55
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,143
it would,

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,360
I probably looked like a 90 year old
man trying to run it frickin hurt.

57
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,070
And what are you legs?

58
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:05,850
Totally swollen.

59
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,683
We doing this?

60
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,533
Yeah.

61
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,850
Yeah.

62
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,091
My,

63
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:09,360
uh,

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,360
my ankles are all swollen and calves that
don't really have an ankle it so same

65
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,710
size from my foot up and yeah,

66
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,380
I mean it's not good for me.

67
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,010
I mean it's not in anybody who
talks about doing hundreds,

68
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,870
hundreds aren't good for probably anybody.

69
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,763
So it's,

70
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:25,981
it's,

71
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:26,814
yeah,

72
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,830
I know that what I do isn't in
the best interest of my body,

73
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,230
but it's just the name of the game.

74
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,150
So what I do do this cock,

75
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,920
Jamie pulled up the
fucking definition is this,

76
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:41,080
an urban dictionary says
a better definition,

77
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,070
I think than the one you gave.

78
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,341
Oh.

79
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:43,174
How dare you.

80
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,830
Demasculated millennial liberal male
who often speaks of white privilege and

81
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:51,640
modern feminism blames white men
for all of the world's problems.

82
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,770
The new definition or

83
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,133
I like,

84
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,400
I like this though.

85
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,510
There goes chat again with the
telling everyone that he's a Vegan.

86
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,403
What a cook.

87
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,310
Okay.

88
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,180
I like that.

89
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,650
I liked that a lot.

90
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,280
But um,

91
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,051
look up cock,

92
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:09,820
hold on here.

93
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,890
But cock hold is different.

94
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,360
It's a different,

95
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,110
uh,

96
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,110
short for cuckservative what they fucking
till word cock is most commonly used

97
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:25,201
on Twitter to describe anti white males
while it was originally formed with the

98
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:28,240
original meaning of cock cock hold.

99
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,380
The use of the word cock does not
necessarily denote a sexual connotation.

100
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:32,591
Wow.

101
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,424
It's morphing.

102
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,740
The language is evolving before our eyes.

103
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,080
Cox do not care about Islamic countries
throwing gays off buildings or hanging

104
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:43,270
them as much as the cake Baker,

105
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,420
who is Christian and warrant
served gay wedding customers.

106
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,751
Oh,

107
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,584
that's interesting.

108
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,071
Coxe.

109
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:51,880
Give a free pass to anyone who criticized
them for fear of looking racist or

110
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:52,481
homophobic.

111
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,250
We'll still have that
lady in Germany is a cook.

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,730
The word originated from
white nationalists vocabulary,

113
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,860
but it's still widely used by all.

114
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,341
Okay.

115
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,174
But that,

116
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,681
so,

117
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:06,790
but they took caught hold and
turned it into this new thing go to.

118
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,730
But what is the definition for Koc hole?

119
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,140
So this has nothing to do with guys'
wives getting bang by Chris does me.

120
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,400
It's still real to me,

121
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,980
dammit.

122
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,680
It's also like an official definition
that an old dictionary from old English,

123
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,800
Oh means a man whose wife
was unfaithful cut cold,

124
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,680
which is yeah.

125
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,150
Yeah,

126
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,090
to make a cuckold of so if you,

127
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:28,361
okay,

128
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,194
that's uh,

129
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,800
that's how Norton I think
described it to me like a man.

130
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:33,161
If you,

131
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:37,000
if your wife is out banging other dudes
and you know about it but you don't say

132
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:37,331
anything,

133
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,380
you become a cock hold.

134
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,430
But there's also like cock hold porn where
it's like I said the guys there while

135
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,730
like sobbing in the corner
while his wife gets grilled.

136
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:49,564
Fucked.

137
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,983
Interesting.

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,480
The world is evolving.

139
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,603
It's beautiful.

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,930
So it's still open,

141
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,880
open season then for use
cook anyway you want,

142
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,540
because we were really just
hit like five definitions.

143
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,640
I still have a fucking clue what I mean.

144
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,500
Yeah.

145
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,980
I mean a bunch of cooks sensitive cooks.

146
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,600
I liked that one definition though.

147
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,130
The the,

148
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,980
the Vegan,

149
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,240
it's gets on the megaphone.

150
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,970
It's usually a Vegan who's been
a Vegan for like a month to,

151
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,690
all right.

152
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,460
Those are my favorite fucking Cox

153
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,421
boy.

154
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,670
How do you pull out of this
and have a normal conversation?

155
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:22,970
Where are we?

156
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:22,970
Do

157
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,591
we go from here,

158
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:24,160
Joe?

159
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,810
We always say you're either a hunter,

160
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:27,730
you're like Brendon
mentioned a berry picker,

161
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,800
and it's in our DNA if you're a hunter.

162
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,860
And to be able to test that against the
toughest conditions against the hardest

163
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:40,210
animals to hunt in the most remote places
is to me the ultimate test of being a

164
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:42,340
human being and ultimate
test of being a hunter.

165
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,050
And that's what drives me and what
we do and why they train year round.

166
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:48,220
Why I'm always thinking about gear,

167
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:48,791
about food,

168
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,331
about Wade,

169
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:50,470
about uh,

170
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:50,891
what,

171
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:51,010
uh,

172
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,310
what,

173
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,180
how I could improve from what I learned
on last year to this coming seasons.

174
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:55,960
Um,

175
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,010
and preparation of it is a,

176
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,790
it's fun.

177
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,061
Yeah,

178
00:05:59,061 --> 00:05:59,894
I love it.

179
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,600
I live it and breathe it and uh,

180
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:01,941
it's,

181
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:02,774
it's challenging.

182
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,650
It's really challenging.

183
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,020
Well,

184
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,930
it unfolded for me,

185
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,440
uh,

186
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,740
and it still continues to do so cause
I've only been doing it for four years.

187
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:09,891
I mean,

188
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:13,850
Rinella got me involved and he
took me out to Montana in 2012.

189
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,170
And uh,

190
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,471
you know,

191
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:15,801
I was like,

192
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,101
Oh hey,

193
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,000
this is kind of be interesting.

194
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,050
Let's see what this is all about,

195
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,050
because I had watched shows
and I read some stuff about it,

196
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,460
but one of the things that he said,

197
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:22,731
he's like,

198
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:22,971
man,

199
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:24,740
there's a steep learning curve to this.

200
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,750
There's a steep lines and it goes long.

201
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,441
And I was like,

202
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:27,531
well,

203
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,311
how long can it go?

204
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:29,440
He fucking find an anime,

205
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,530
shoot it and kill it and eat.

206
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,760
It would seem so hard.

207
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,710
But then as you get into it,

208
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:34,544
you realize,

209
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,780
and then of course bow hunting,

210
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:38,480
which is the most difficult
of the most difficult pursuit.

211
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,620
And as you get into it,

212
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:40,250
you realize like,

213
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,880
oh,

214
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,850
this is like some crazy puzzle.

215
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,440
It's like some crazy challenge that you
have to figure that also involves a way

216
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,370
to procure your food.

217
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,330
It does.

218
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,490
And it's a skill set you
never quit learning on.

219
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,933
Every time you go,

220
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,780
I learned something new.

221
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:55,351
Yeah,

222
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:55,980
there's a,

223
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,900
there's a natural
progression you go through.

224
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,090
I mean it's like you're
just excited to be there.

225
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,630
Right?

226
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,710
And then your,

227
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,573
and then you,

228
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,950
you see it with people you've
take out for the first time.

229
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:05,430
They're just like,

230
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,641
oh,

231
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,020
kind of what's what's going on here.

232
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:07,291
And you know,

233
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,870
and then then all of a sudden they
get a little click and it's like,

234
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,243
I want to get one,

235
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,140
you know?

236
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,960
And then,

237
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,231
you know,

238
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:14,850
that's usually a couple of years and then,

239
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,300
and then,

240
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,570
yeah,

241
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,080
I want to get an,

242
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,390
I'm going to get a nicer one than
one I got last time and I want,

243
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:20,010
you want to do something
a little more challenging.

244
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:22,080
And it just keeps progressing until like,

245
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,423
you know,

246
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,450
till you get,

247
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:24,750
you know,

248
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,471
wherever it ends.

249
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:25,791
And it's,

250
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,380
it's you,

251
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,930
you're hunting the,

252
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,250
the toughest animals,

253
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:30,150
the biggest animals,

254
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:33,280
the oldest animals in the toughest
conditions and being successful and,

255
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,920
and a lot of people won't get there,

256
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,400
but it's,

257
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,880
it's,

258
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,050
it's always a challenge.

259
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,250
It's something that never gets old.

260
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:38,851
I mean,

261
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:39,061
it's,

262
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:39,510
it's,

263
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,731
you know,

264
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:41,880
it was comparable to any athletic event.

265
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,800
Only you can do it for your whole life,

266
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:44,190
you know?

267
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,910
I mean,

268
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,620
there's lots of stuff you do athletic
and then in growing up or whatever,

269
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:50,041
and it's like,

270
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,090
but it doesn't really translate,

271
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:51,400
you know,

272
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,380
a college wrestler that doesn't translate
that well to write the rest of your

273
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:56,210
life.

274
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,620
Exactly.

275
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,980
You're that dude down there at
the intermural wrestling like,

276
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,480
ah,

277
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,360
you've missed,

278
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:00,870
you know,

279
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,590
hunting is one thing that is
just throughout your entire life.

280
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,730
Depending on where you're at.

281
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:05,941
I mean,

282
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:06,270
you can,

283
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,480
it's,

284
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,450
you can always continue
to learn and pursue it.

285
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:09,931
And you know,

286
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:10,530
sometimes you,

287
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:10,801
you know,

288
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:13,230
you don't have a ton of time
you can do a short on sometimes,

289
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,100
you know,

290
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,970
things are going well,

291
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:15,990
you can do something that's,

292
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:16,261
you know,

293
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,160
an epic adventure.

294
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:18,510
But it's always a challenge.

295
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:19,710
It never gets easy though.

296
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,200
I mean,

297
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,650
the,

298
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,280
the animal you killed
last time does not care.

299
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,620
The,

300
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,630
the new animal you're hunting does
not care what you got last time.

301
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:28,411
You have to go out.

302
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:30,030
You gotta be sharp every single time.

303
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,250
Yeah.
