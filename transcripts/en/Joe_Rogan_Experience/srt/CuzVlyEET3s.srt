1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,630
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,300
A lot of us get there,

3
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:04,780
right?

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,430
A lot of people that we know came from
a place where when they were really

5
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:10,240
young,

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,901
they were like,

7
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:13,090
what the fuck is going on with the world?

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,600
Yep.

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:13,781
Wait,

10
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:14,410
how old were you?

11
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,810
Do you think you were
when you had your first,

12
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,381
Oh,

13
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:19,930
I think my parents might
be fucking crazy thought.

14
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,651
What do you like?

15
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:22,930
These people are in charge
of telling me what to do.

16
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:23,860
This is nonsense.

17
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:24,400
You're making you,

18
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,630
you're talking crazy talk here.

19
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,690
It happens.

20
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,070
It happened for me.

21
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,610
Uh,

22
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,110
the first time that I took,

23
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,610
uh,

24
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,443
LSD.

25
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,030
Uh,

26
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,110
and maybe before that,

27
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:34,100
but when I took Lsd,

28
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,520
I,

29
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,960
when I took LSD for the first time,

30
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:37,270
I can remember when,

31
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,780
whenever you take Lsd,

32
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:39,670
uh,

33
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,431
especially,

34
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:40,850
you know,

35
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,380
I mean,

36
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:41,661
you know,

37
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:42,650
when I took Lsd,

38
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,820
what worries do I have?

39
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,320
I'm in fucking high school.

40
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:45,891
There's no,

41
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:46,850
there's nothing in there.

42
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:47,684
There's nothing to,

43
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,100
there's no demons to come swimming out
of my brain and taught me with like all

44
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:54,080
the myriad of things you
get when you're older.

45
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,640
There's this fucking
nothing you would just open.

46
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:56,881
I'm,

47
00:00:56,881 --> 00:01:00,680
I might be upset cause like a
cheerleader that came over to my house,

48
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,480
I couldn't figure out how to kiss her.

49
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:05,660
Maybe that's like the biggest
problem I'm having at the time.

50
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:06,290
So,

51
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:06,561
but I,

52
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:06,831
you know,

53
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:11,180
at that time when I did it for the first
time and had that initial experience,

54
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:11,900
uh,

55
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,351
you know,

56
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:14,360
when you go back to your
parents who've never taken it,

57
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,760
and if you mentioned it to
them that you'd even taken it,

58
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:20,090
they might want to put you in a drug
rehab or they think you're insane or they

59
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:21,560
think you're getting down the wrong track.

60
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,360
You're forced into this place of like,

61
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,433
fuck man,

62
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,363
I can't,

63
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,290
I w you guys don't even,

64
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,700
you don't even know you,

65
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:30,140
you don't even understand this,

66
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,740
this a new way of experiencing life,

67
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,490
you know,

68
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,000
so,

69
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,930
and I think there's a lot of people who
spend their whole lives never knowing

70
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,870
that you don't have to take
psychedelics to get to that place.

71
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:43,340
There's other ways to get to that place.

72
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,360
But yeah,

73
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:45,890
it's a very strange thing.

74
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,870
And those people who
never get to that place,

75
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:48,920
they're the ones who are,

76
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,210
a lot of them are,

77
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:50,931
are in control.

78
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:51,200
Right.

79
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,200
So your life took a inexorable change
when you did acid that was like the point

80
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:57,650
where you look back and you said,

81
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,020
this is the point where I
went off into this direction.

82
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,410
Um,

83
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,670
well I know I'd say that the,

84
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,210
the,

85
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:03,531
that,

86
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:07,590
that taking acid started
with a series of like books.

87
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,870
It started with contact with like,

88
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,153
you know,

89
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,630
the whole weirdness.

90
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,270
My whole weird weirdness started with,

91
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,680
or as I recall,

92
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:21,681
it started with me coming upon this
book that my mom had called Raja Yoga by

93
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:24,360
Yogi mature Rocka,

94
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,260
who by the way,

95
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,350
it was never a Yogi was
just some English mistake.

96
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,710
Okay.

97
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,200
Mind about being a Yogi.

98
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,050
But it's a fascinating story.

99
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,830
But the book,

100
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,430
uh,

101
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,731
you know,

102
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:39,660
that was the first time
I'd ever read the idea.

103
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,620
They,

104
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,340
you there that you are an
observer observing yourself,

105
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,060
that you,

106
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,400
you aren't necessarily the you,

107
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,240
that you think the you,

108
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,940
that can be observed is not you.

109
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,410
You're the observer state,

110
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,250
the mindfulness,

111
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,330
the watch or that's when I,

112
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,820
that's the first time I'd come upon
the idea of what that's called,

113
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:57,390
the amen.

114
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,470
The thing that observes yourself,

115
00:02:59,471 --> 00:02:59,651
you know,

116
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,000
when you,

117
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,221
you know,

118
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:00,761
someone will say,

119
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,320
I'm really mad right now.

120
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,870
The moment you say I'm mad,

121
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,610
you're creating a distinction.

122
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,181
You know,

123
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,640
between the thing that's
observing that you're mad.

124
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:10,750
And the thing that's mad.

125
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,980
So that observer,

126
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:12,880
that watcher,

127
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,230
that's the thing that,

128
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,270
that mindfulness is what,

129
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:16,631
you know,

130
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,850
throughout my whole life I try to,

131
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,301
you know,

132
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:23,950
go into that place of observing
myself rather than being the thing.

133
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,510
And it's a game that you can play in.

134
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,520
It really is quite
helpful with a variety of,

135
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:29,231
of problems,

136
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:30,940
especially if you get really angry.

137
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,510
If you get really angry and you can
stop yourself and just watch and there's

138
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,421
tools you can use.

139
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:37,811
In that book.

140
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,800
I remember it said as you walk around,

141
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,740
start thinking he is walking.

142
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,210
That was like one of the tools,

143
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:45,310
like it's in a book and
you're a character in a book.

144
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,760
So when you're going around,

145
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,380
you're like,

146
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,651
you know,

147
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:50,110
right now he's doing a podcast right now.

148
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,980
He's talking.

149
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,940
And so that's,

150
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,540
these are,

151
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,370
these are activities
designed to create this,

152
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,730
like the watcher,

153
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,550
the state of presence of watching.

154
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,660
So that started it.

155
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,950
That led me to like,

156
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,900
you know,

157
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,151
I,

158
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,200
and then I found out about,

159
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,960
you know,

160
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,400
I,

161
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,880
I,

162
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,010
I think I read the
electric koolaid acid test,

163
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,830
you know,

164
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,840
about fucking,

165
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,261
uh,

166
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:12,400
Ken Keyes and the merry
pranksters blasting themselves
on acid and going to the

167
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:13,450
world's fair and a bus.

168
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,950
Then I read that shit.

169
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,191
No,

170
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:15,671
I remember,

171
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,120
wait,

172
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,650
I'll tell you then I'll stop this weird,

173
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,633
weird rant.

174
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,050
I remember now.

175
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,500
Fucking filmstrip that's
what it started in my head.

176
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:28,000
I think I was in fourth grade and they
showed us a drug filmstrip remember film

177
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,430
strips new fucking popped up.

178
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:32,020
This guy like it taught,

179
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,801
there's a guy,

180
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,030
I still remember it to guy in it.

181
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,920
It's a guy in a fucking,

182
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:36,754
um,

183
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,280
empty apartment and he's curled against
the law and the fetal position and it's

184
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,440
an LSD and it looks terrible.

185
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,420
And then the narrator says,

186
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,330
Lsd can make you
experience hallucinations,

187
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,190
you can see dragons.

188
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,151
And I remember him saying,

189
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,140
you could see drag is,

190
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:53,800
I'm like,

191
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,311
I want to see you.

192
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:55,144
Okay,

193
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,710
that sounds awesome.

194
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,560
Fuck the empty apartment.

195
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,470
The fetal position.

196
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,580
I'll figure it out.

197
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,830
That guy's a pussy.

198
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,570
Like what are you crying?

199
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:08,860
So dragging a little bit,

200
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,670
it took acid and takes back.

201
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,573
Yeah.

202
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,830
And that was that put
it in my head is like,

203
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:17,470
well you know I think that that's
an interesting thing to explore but

204
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,973
yeah.

205
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,420
Yeah.

206
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,330
Oh that's hilarious.

207
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,710
So you think that you were
like to Dunkin's like Dunkin
one and Dunkin to like

208
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:30,010
Dunkin one is like regular
Dunkin growing up innocent boy.

209
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,430
Sure.

210
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,181
Boom.

211
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,520
Psychedelics and then Dunkin 2.0

212
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,060
yeah.

213
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,400
Yeah that there's
definitely a dunk into that.

214
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,930
That happened I'd say.

215
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,330
And then that that
Dunkin to change too man.

216
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:40,930
Cause you,

217
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,231
you know,

218
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:41,980
as you get older,

219
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,650
the best thing,

220
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,510
there's two great,

221
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,150
the best thing that can happen
to use you get knocked off track.

222
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,280
That's the best thing that
can happen to you in general.

223
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,490
Cause generally the track you're on has
been set for you by people who never got

224
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:54,700
off their track.

225
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,450
You end up,

226
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:55,781
you know,

227
00:05:55,781 --> 00:06:00,200
you end up the child of someone decided
to have you in their twenties 2122

228
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,790
they're not going to know a lot of stuff.

229
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,700
They're not going to understand the
universe that much unless they were like

230
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,230
came from a really good family of
like artists are intelligent people.

231
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,180
Chances are they're scared,

232
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,871
hungry,

233
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,590
desperate,

234
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,370
angry.

235
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,580
They don't want to be in
the relationship anymore.

236
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,270
They don't want to be monogamous anymore.

237
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,720
The idea of non monogamy to
them might just seem insane.

238
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,111
The,

239
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,351
you know,

240
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:22,940
like who the fuck knows?

241
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,760
But you're born into that planet.

242
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:26,000
You're,

243
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
that's the atmosphere you're born into.

244
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,990
That's what you're breathing
when you're first born.

245
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,640
And that can set you on a weird path.

246
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,980
And that's a very sad
path that you can get on.

247
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,320
And so hopefully if you're lucky,

248
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:37,310
you'll come across somebody,

249
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,990
you knocks you off that fucking path.

250
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:39,470
You know,

251
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,210
I remember the guy who
hooked me up with acid.

252
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,360
I remember sitting in the theater
of my school cause I was taking,

253
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:47,780
I was a drama nerd and I sitting in the
theater of my school and next to this

254
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:48,614
guy

255
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,080
next to this Guy Brad.

256
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,320
And uh,

257
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,960
I remember seeing an I and we were
talking and he mentioned tripping on Lsd.

258
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,281
And I'm like,

259
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,114
what?

260
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,361
It's like,

261
00:06:59,361 --> 00:06:59,571
oh yeah,

262
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:00,740
I took acid over the weekend.

263
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:01,574
I'm like,

264
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,370
well why you can get acid,

265
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,200
the movie,

266
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,030
the life,

267
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,850
the life of somebody must animate this.

268
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:11,921
Somebody,

269
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:12,010
the

270
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,601
police.

271
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:15,120
I know your folks out
there that animate shit.

272
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,710
You got to animate this,

273
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,430
that,

274
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,820
that moment took me two,

275
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:21,720
and this is really weird.

276
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:22,261
Tell me what the,

277
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:23,520
the first trip was like.

278
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,940
God,

279
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,870
I love to,

280
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,100
the first trip was it was white blotter,

281
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,780
a white blotter paper.

282
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:31,060
I,

283
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,410
I don't,

284
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,490
it was just white bladder,

285
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,451
a little Pete,

286
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:34,140
you know,

287
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,520
somehow if you don't know this,

288
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,170
uh,

289
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,580
LSD gets put on sheets.

290
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,290
Let's just look like blotter paper.

291
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,430
And sometimes they have design,

292
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:42,390
sometimes they don't.

293
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:46,710
But the name is always a reference to
usually as a reference to the design on

294
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:47,101
the sheet.

295
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:47,760
So,

296
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,001
uh,

297
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:48,810
you know,

298
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,351
purple,

299
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,011
Jesus,

300
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,720
White Blotter of lips.

301
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,230
You know,

302
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,290
there's a million different names
for the different types of acid,

303
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:55,710
but,

304
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,610
so this is just white.

305
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,391
You who knows what it was,

306
00:07:57,391 --> 00:08:00,870
but it was really good and
I can remember I took it

307
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,420
and you have to,

308
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:03,601
you know,

309
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:06,450
it takes 30 to 45 minutes
sometimes longer for it to kick in.

310
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,450
I still remember I was sitting
in my friend's trailer in
a trailer park in North

311
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,310
Carolina sitting in an empty back,

312
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,790
like when it like an empty Jacuzzi
tub that was in this trailer.

313
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,480
And I'm sitting there and they're
watching star wars and I'm sitting in this

314
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,660
bathtub and all of a sudden the greatest,

315
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,460
it's the greatest feeling just started
going through my legs and up into my

316
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:30,090
body.

317
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,980
And it was a fucking sword fight.

318
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,701
It was a,

319
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:33,900
a light saber fight.

320
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,470
Bam,

321
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,020
Bam.

322
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,791
When I'm listening to that.

323
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:36,750
But all of a sudden now,

324
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,160
the sounds echoey,

325
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,080
like someone's turned an echo up on it.

326
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:40,380
So I was like,

327
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:40,531
yeah,

328
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:40,920
well,

329
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,753
you know,

330
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,980
parents kind of bouncing around.

331
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,890
It's beautiful and I feel so fucking good.

332
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,240
Started laughing.

333
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:49,290
It seems so funny.

334
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,650
Then I went outside and lay in
the grass and staring at the sky.

335
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,720
Everything's beautiful.

336
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,460
You put your hand in front of your face
and it's just this rainbow of hands

337
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,080
drifting in front of your face.

338
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,880
Everything's breathing.

339
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,550
They're my friends come running out
because they knew this is the first time I

340
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:08,100
was tripping and they all
start jumping over me.

341
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:09,570
They're like jumping over me is,

342
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:13,740
I'm low and they're laughing and we're
all fucking laughing and it's just

343
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,670
perfect.

344
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,760
Then I remember they
pulled their cock out.

345
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,200
That's when they pulled that too.

346
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,840
We all started fucking,

347
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,230
we fucked and fucked and then a dog came
by and we grabbed the dog and started

348
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,470
fucking the dog.

349
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,793
No,

350
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,240
no.

351
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,150
It was beautiful to the spirit of acid.

352
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:32,960
It's very now.

353
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,391
Yeah,

354
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:34,650
there was no fucking happening.

355
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,750
There was a lot of like laughing.

356
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,231
There was a,

357
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:42,231
I remember going into my friend's shitty
high school car and like sitting in

358
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:46,680
like pulling the seat back and looking
at the ceiling and I'm looking at the

359
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:51,660
ceiling and it's fucking hieroglyphics
or some kind of like ancient writing.

360
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:51,930
You know,

361
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,970
I don't even think I knew
what Sanskrit was at the time,

362
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:54,780
but I probably be like,

363
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:54,961
oh,

364
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:59,910
I'm seeing Stan script some kind of
runes are glyphs all over my friend's car

365
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:04,530
that she's kind of breathing and
warping and it's just beautiful.

366
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,640
So yeah,

367
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:06,181
that was the,

368
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,410
that was the first time.

369
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:07,570
And,

370
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,300
and once you've had that experience,

371
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,970
how do you go back to a world,

372
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,380
a normal kind of world?

373
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,401
Incredible.

374
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:14,880
Amazing.

375
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,480
What is it?

376
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,390
It's cursed.

377
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,543
Swale

378
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,473
is a,

379
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,840
they call him a futurist and
he's responsible for many,

380
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:22,651
many patents.

381
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:23,341
He's a brilliant,

382
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,174
brilliant man.

383
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,110
And um,

384
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,340
he is a huge proponent of the idea
of the technological singularity.

385
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,730
And the idea behind that is that one
day artificial intelligence is going to

386
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,900
literally and virtually come alive and
we're going to merge with it somehow.

387
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,640
We are either going to be downloaded into
computers or consciousness is going to

388
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:48,660
be replicated and indistinguishable from
our current consciousness and that will

389
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:49,950
be downloaded into computers.

390
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,200
And though our biological body will die,

391
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,840
are our electronic signal.

392
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:57,540
That is our consciousness
that has been recreated.

393
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:57,780
Like,

394
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,141
you know,

395
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,880
like you copy a Microsoft word file.

396
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,180
Yeah.

397
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,890
You will copy your mind,

398
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,360
you will copy your consciousness,

399
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,050
your soul.

400
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,490
Yeah.

401
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:04,830
Yeah.

402
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,330
You will copy something and you will
put it into this whatever the fuck it is

403
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:10,380
that holds all this stuff.

404
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,680
But what we're saying is that life is
almost completely connected to technology

405
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:18,691
and it's a very,

406
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,840
very short time that this
has happened 200 years ago.

407
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:22,800
There were no cars,

408
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,371
you know,

409
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:27,420
so in those 200 years we have
been connected to cars who was,

410
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:27,820
um,

411
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,350
a really fascinating video that someone
sent me that I put up on Twitter.

412
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:32,850
I retweeted it the other day.

413
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:34,920
You can find it if you just
scour through my Twitter,

414
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,190
but it's a time lapse video of,

415
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,113
uh,

416
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,630
of cars moving back and forth on freeways
and how it looks like blood and the

417
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,040
car.

418
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,820
Yeah.

419
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,390
How it looks like the pulsating
of blood coming back and forth.

420
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,081
You know,

421
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:56,080
I mean it's clearly is the breath
of breathing in and breathing out,

422
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:56,980
you know,

423
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,050
the heartbeats in and out the cars leave
the house and come back to that house.

424
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:01,541
I mean,

425
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,440
it really is.

426
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,490
It really is like,

427
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,590
it's a type of life form.

428
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,340
It's just,

429
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,870
it happens so slowly.

430
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:08,800
All this traffic sucks.

431
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:09,580
My Dick,

432
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:09,881
you know,

433
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:10,510
on the fucking,

434
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,450
my car's dying shit and
all these things that you,

435
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,010
you micro manage that,

436
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:15,970
that scenario.

437
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:19,000
And then you don't see it
as this pulsating thing of,

438
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,580
of cars coming in and cars going out.

439
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,190
And how many of them go
in the same God damn door

440
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,090
every day?

441
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,661
Here's the thing,

442
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:24,901
man.

443
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:25,620
And this is where the,

444
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,490
I think about this all the
time because the way for,

445
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,940
for things to work,

446
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:31,260
the way they're working right now,

447
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,570
which is for there to be capitalism in
there to be super rich people and super

448
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:39,780
poor people in war and all
the things that you know,

449
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,240
or rather distasteful or seem to be,

450
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:42,980
uh,

451
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,290
uh,

452
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,720
seem to be a destructive for that,

453
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:46,260
to exist.

454
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,240
Each of those little nodes of
consciousness that represent
that bloodstream have

455
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:54,600
to think they're individuals and have
to think they're more important than all

456
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:55,434
the other ones.

457
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,410
So you've got a bunch of
blood cells all thinking,

458
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:58,561
yeah,

459
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,251
I got to get to work.

460
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,110
What the fuck's wrong with
this asshole in front of me?

461
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,080
And not realizing they're all
part of this one super organism.

462
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,660
And if somehow everyone's consciousness
shifted from the idea of like,

463
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:13,110
I gotta get to work to whatever
the next thing would be,

464
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:18,000
which is I'm connected to this
super mind that is the planet,

465
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:18,870
which I think is going to,

466
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,220
that's what the singularity will be.

467
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:21,720
It will be some technologically,

468
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,890
uh,

469
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,431
uh,

470
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:28,431
applied empathy that allows everyone to
connect their consciousness to mother

471
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,491
earth.

472
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:29,671
Yeah.

473
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:34,380
That moment capitalism kind of ceases
as we know it and capitalism of course,

474
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:34,950
it's just a,

475
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,480
it's a symptom of something deeper.

476
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:37,470
But that,

477
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,970
that model,

478
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,970
the model that's running
everything is no longer possible.

479
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,160
And that model encourages
a competition model,

480
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:51,161
encourages people to push and strive and
push beyond their comfort in order to,

481
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,371
you know,

482
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:55,790
to create more action and create
more money to create more,

483
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,780
more building,

484
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,130
more construction,

485
00:13:58,131 --> 00:13:58,760
more,

486
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,591
more things,

487
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,380
more wars,

488
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,191
more prisons,

489
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:02,024
more la,

490
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,470
buying more things,

491
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,400
more diseases.

492
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:05,790
So we can have more realism.

493
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,310
Yeah.

494
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,881
All of it.

495
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:08,930
It all accelerates.

496
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,430
They invented diseases.

497
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,481
It's a,

498
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:13,100
it's a fascinating thing man.

499
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,611
You know,

500
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:13,941
the,

501
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:14,540
uh,

502
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,350
the idea that everything moves in the
same direction is that the single celled

503
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:19,184
organisms,

504
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:19,820
you know,

505
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,180
that,

506
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,690
you know,

507
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,340
or even how about we look at blood,

508
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:22,521
you know,

509
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:24,080
when you're talking
about it looking like a,

510
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,120
like blood moving through arteries,

511
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:26,811
you know,

512
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:28,150
blood is a single cell,

513
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:28,450
you know,

514
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,450
single cells of blood move as in the
same as this huge animal that has a,

515
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,120
you know,

516
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,220
billions of cells and not just that,

517
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:41,570
but is also a host for all sorts of
bacteria and stuff that live inside of our

518
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:42,404
bodies.

519
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,580
But we have to,

520
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:47,000
in order to keep it going in the
same direction as those cells,

521
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:52,150
we have to have all these different
little tools that we use sort of justify

522
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:53,270
existence,

523
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,990
all these different little tools
like the love of having your baby,

524
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,910
the love of Orgasms,

525
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,570
you know,

526
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,990
the love of going on stage
or of creating something,

527
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:03,390
you know,

528
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,990
and you think about the one
thing that's the most satisfying,

529
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,501
you know,

530
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:10,190
outside of childbirth and in having
your own children is creating,

531
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,791
you know,

532
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,791
people who don't create things I think
as a whole are way less happy than people

533
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:17,540
who do create things.

534
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,030
And I know dudes that make pool cues.

535
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,800
I know dudes that make belts,

536
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:25,610
they make custom wallets and there's a
something that they get when they like,

537
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:25,851
you know,

538
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,350
I bought a wallet from this dude and you,

539
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,710
you buy a wallet from him and he sells
you the wallet and he made it for you and

540
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:30,920
shit.

541
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,390
Like there's a smile that he has,

542
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,980
like he created something,

543
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:37,590
he created a piece of artwork and
someone else is appreciating a,

544
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:38,031
wow,

545
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:39,500
I love how you did this is wow,

546
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:40,490
this is awesome work.

547
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,230
It's so clean and well done.

548
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:42,471
He's like,

549
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:42,881
thank you.

550
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,660
I like his effort and his,

551
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,170
his creativity have gone
into an actual object.

552
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,820
And to us that's very,

553
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:50,181
very,

554
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,290
very satisfying.

555
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,860
And then there's the comedy satisfaction
that you get for performing.

556
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:55,551
I mean that's all we,

557
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:56,510
you and I understand.

558
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:56,641
I mean,

559
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:57,200
you don't understand it.

560
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,370
I guess it's in music,

561
00:15:58,371 --> 00:15:59,590
it's probably just the same thing.

562
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,440
You create a song and then people
love that song creating something.

563
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,200
Then what are you doing when you're
creating something while you're doing the

564
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,190
same fucking thing.

565
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,630
You're,

566
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,140
you're pushing the machine,

567
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,650
you're pushing it in your way and
your way is making people happy and,

568
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,050
and giving people some
positive energy by your DVD.

569
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,050
And there's an industry behind that and
they come see what the clubs and this

570
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,310
cause industry behind that.

571
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:24,650
Even behind putting gas in
their cars and you know,

572
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,041
it's,

573
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:25,281
it's,

574
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:26,300
it's a really,

575
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,710
it's amazing how many
different pieces are in place.

576
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,191
If you,

577
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:30,110
if you take back,

578
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:30,920
if you like,

579
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,460
you know,

580
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,050
zoom in on the idea of what is creation
and creation is taking something from

581
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,300
the nothingness and bringing
it into the something that's,

582
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:42,160
and so you sort of become the doorway for
sending that come from the nothingness

583
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,450
into the,

584
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,161
something I said,

585
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:44,030
when you're creating,

586
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,330
you're actually experiencing a as flow
through from the infinite into the finite

587
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:53,990
and that I think that is the feeling
that we love so much is that sense of

588
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,100
feeling that that thing
when you're working on jokes
and all of a sudden it goes

589
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,930
from being a drudge
Tavis sudden it's like,

590
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:00,764
Holy Shit,

591
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,281
you know,

592
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:01,910
it's happening.

593
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,870
All of a sudden you get sucked
into this weird vacuum and you,

594
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,490
you've written for like two
hours and it feels like a second.

595
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,300
You know,

596
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,130
that that sense of being pulled into a
momentary current or something's coming

597
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:16,340
out of you that's clearly
not necessarily you.

598
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,550
That to me is like one of the ultimate.

599
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:19,911
It is,

600
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:20,970
it's the ultimate feeling.

601
00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:22,020
And I have the,

602
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,401
you know,

603
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:27,401
I think if you go by this idea of this
attractor that Mckenna talks about her,

604
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:32,090
this thing that exists and hyper
hyperspace that it's what it wants to come

605
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:32,361
through.

606
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:35,750
I send it this universe that wants
to express itself through us.

607
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,580
And um,

608
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,820
I think that's the compulsion
that you're talking about.

609
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:43,370
I think that's an alternative
viewpoint obviously.

610
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,090
Um,

611
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,370
there's the cynical way
of looking at it like,

612
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:46,641
no,

613
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:46,881
no,

614
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:47,091
no,

615
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:47,271
no.

616
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:49,830
That's a natural inclination
that people have.

617
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,150
Monkeys are curious.

618
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,140
This is what we do.

619
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,700
We think about things.

620
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,480
And every joke that you have is just,

621
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,820
is a cumulation of your life experiences
and you're figuring out a little bit,

622
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:00,654
congratulations.

623
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,430
You're not tapping into the universal
consciousness will be ranked back.

624
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,780
Sarah Pailin is on the line and we're
going to have a nice little sit down with

625
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:10,590
a future president of the United States.

626
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,500
Maybe let's hope he doesn't fuck anybody,

627
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,110
that he's not married to
buy imaginary rituals.

628
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,761
The thing about it,

629
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:18,630
but you know what I'm saying?

630
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,080
The cynical point of view
about the idea of creativity.

631
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,570
There's something to
that point of view too.

632
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,740
You have to address it.

633
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:30,741
You can't always go hippie and one of the
things I bet I bounced back and forth.

634
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,680
I don't think it is either,

635
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:32,514
but it is a little,

636
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,780
I bounced back and forth with the
idea of the imagination being a,

637
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,370
almost like when you,

638
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,470
when you have imagination,

639
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,260
the imagination is the
real force behind the,

640
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:47,280
the evolution.

641
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,860
What imagination truly is
is we think of as like,

642
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,221
oh,

643
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:51,210
I can see things.

644
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:52,890
I go and work around problems.

645
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:53,724
I have this idea.

646
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,610
But when you imagine an idea,

647
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:57,870
when you imagine a product,

648
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,690
you imagine how to design an engine
for a car and you're the for,

649
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:01,861
you know,

650
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:03,960
your Henry Ford or whoever the
fuck made the first engine.

651
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,041
When you're,

652
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:10,041
your imagination has this idea for this
thing and then you build it and design

653
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:11,610
it and boom,

654
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,473
it's there.

655
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,850
That thought what there,

656
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:17,760
there was no thought of
that before it existed.

657
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,000
It's not that people were running around
thinking of the car and I know it's

658
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:22,530
going to look like there
was no thought of it.

659
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:25,260
You created this or it came to you.

660
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,510
There was something from nothing,

661
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,403
something from,

662
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,210
from what is that from the ether.

663
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,500
Something from these.

664
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,980
Even if it's just these
synapses firing in your mind,

665
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,550
where is,

666
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,660
what is the signal,

667
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,110
what is the root of this
signal to be so you know,

668
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,720
mathematical about it and say,

669
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,201
wow,

670
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,450
it's just human ingenuity
and that's what it is.

671
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,840
It's good old sticktuitiveness and your
roll up your sleeves and yet figure out

672
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:49,680
this world want that.

673
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:52,080
Henry Ford created a
great thing and you know,

674
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:53,190
whilst dinner and Tosh,

675
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,500
I understand he was a great fella.

676
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,550
[inaudible] neurons sweating.

677
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,150
Yeah.

678
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,660
You know,

679
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,230
I don't necessarily know it's,

680
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,280
it is possible that the imagination is
something that is information that is out

681
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:04,801
there.

682
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:05,231
Like the,

683
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:06,900
the idea of the acacia records,

684
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,050
the idea of uh,

685
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,680
you know,

686
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,380
that there's shit out there.

687
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,820
And then what we are is
little antennas and that our,

688
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:16,190
when we tune into something,

689
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,250
if we pick up this,

690
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,700
this signal for the engine
and someone picks it up,

691
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,450
excellent.

692
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,950
Once that piece is in place,

693
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,551
oh,

694
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:25,450
and then it flowers and blossoms like,

695
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,570
like a Fibonacci sequence on a fucking,

696
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,473
uh,

697
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,520
a sunflower.

698
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:29,881
You know,

699
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:30,870
it all bursts out,

700
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,380
you know,

701
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,330
exponentially in certain directions.

702
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:36,300
And then that starts creating
more inventions with all,

703
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,920
which also burst out.

704
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,280
But all of them emanate in
the imagination initially.

705
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,740
All of them have to be thought up auto.

706
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:48,741
All of them have to be created by the
human mind or what the human mind can tune

707
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:49,180
into.

708
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,890
There's no way into this
universe as a human,

709
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,750
but through a pussy.

710
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,040
And there's no way.

711
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:02,041
Now there is no way for an idea to come
into this universe except through a

712
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:03,551
thought.

713
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:06,250
There's no way for an invention
except it to come through our mind.

714
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:07,150
Our minds are the,

715
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,300
our minds are sort of the creative
orifices through which all innovation,

716
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,440
every invention,

717
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,610
every idea comes.

718
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:16,840
It's through the human mind.

719
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:17,410
Now,

720
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:22,410
if you want to think that some day you
just wake up and you get in the shower

721
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,050
and you get lucky enough for your neurons
to fire a certain way where you figure

722
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:31,030
out how to reduce the cost of making
solar power panels and solve the uh,

723
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:31,391
you know,

724
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,860
the energy problem on the planet.

725
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,360
If you want to think
that that's an accident,

726
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,140
fine.

727
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,801
If it helps you.

728
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:39,460
It seems like it helps a lot of people
to think that the universe springs from

729
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:43,030
some kind of lightening pole adding
plasma or the earth does or humor,

730
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,320
biological life on the earth.

731
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:49,030
And some people like to think that their
neurons get lucky in fire cause they

732
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:52,540
squeeze their brow together in the
right way and popped out an idea.

733
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,660
But I think you'll find that
most of the great creators,

734
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,110
they don't think that
you know when you write,

735
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,560
but is that because the best way to
create is to not think about yourself?

736
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,720
The best way to create is like when
you start thinking about yourself,

737
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,430
the ego starts tripping over his own dick
and you start thinking about like how

738
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:10,264
cool you are.

739
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,540
That's like when you see a guy on stage
and the guy like obviously thinks she's

740
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,000
cool.

741
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,380
The worst it's the worst is the
feeling is a feeling of gross.

742
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:22,360
Nist is a disconnect and that disconnect
also disconnects him from creativity.

743
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,300
Whereas if you see a guy on stage
and he's just in the moment,

744
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:25,481
man,

745
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:26,440
he doesn't give a fuck.

746
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:27,490
He's just tuned into it.

747
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,740
So compelling and so interesting.

748
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,290
You know?

749
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,950
So maybe it's a trick,

750
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,963
you know what I'm saying?

751
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,890
Like maybe this idea that you know that
we are tuning into the infinite and it

752
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,420
is maybe not,

753
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,870
maybe it just requires a certain
state of mind to be creative.

754
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,210
And that state of mine
is to avoid the ego.

755
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,190
Like the car.

756
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,450
They don't just invent the car,

757
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,740
you invent the wheel first.

758
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,540
And it's because somebody sat there like,

759
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:52,751
Hey,

760
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:56,140
I need to take stone or
take heavy thing over here.

761
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:56,640
You know,

762
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,370
it's,

763
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,050
I understand the intent of the movie.

764
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,460
I think it's also necessity.

765
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,710
Inventions come with
necessity certainly is,

766
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:03,670
but guess what?

767
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:05,290
Antelopes on event and shit.

768
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,750
They keep getting jacked
by Jaguars left and right.

769
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:08,650
They're stupid fucks.

770
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:10,120
They never figure it out every year.

771
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,370
They never invented annual mobe car.

772
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,800
Whether you can just give
the finger to the Jaguar,

773
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,900
beeped the Horn and run
over the Jaguar babies.

774
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:17,734
They seen the road.

775
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,120
They can't do it.

776
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,200
We can and the one of the reasons why we
can is because we're conscious because

777
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,370
we can think and,

778
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:25,600
but what is thinking?

779
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,250
The real question is what are,

780
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:30,220
what are all these things firing together,

781
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:31,420
solving problems.

782
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,960
What is all that really because
some people can't solve shit.

783
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:35,531
There's,

784
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,120
it's very clear that there's a,

785
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,160
there's different types of people.

786
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,630
There's people that are super solvers
and there's people that can barely solve

787
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,890
taking a shit and wiping
their ass correctly.

788
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,920
There's people that can barely
show up for work every day.

789
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,210
Everything they do is a fucking mass
and they make more people that are just

790
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:53,661
like that.

791
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:55,820
Well if you think that there's
an order to the whole thing,

792
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,380
what are those fucks here for?

793
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,891
You know,

794
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:01,850
are they here just until robots can
become invented to do menial tasks?

795
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:02,900
Is that what it is?

796
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,620
Well yeah.

797
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,190
Here's the thing.

798
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,651
What you do,

799
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,270
this is what you do.

800
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,880
Especially you don't,

801
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,030
you think of an IC eat
and when things get bad,

802
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,900
for sure they think of like
the greatest idea ever.

803
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:11,721
And your brains though,

804
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:16,010
didn't he get mad cow disease
where ions will fuck you up.

805
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:16,371
You can,

806
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,380
if you cannibalize you
candidate every the brain,

807
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,850
the brain,

808
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,130
just the legs,

809
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,900
nature,

810
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,170
nature's balls and asshole
rates are goes bitch,

811
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,060
you got a problem,

812
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,530
people brains you fucking crazy.

813
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,300
Pella chips are delicious.

814
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:30,861
If you look at,

815
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:31,310
if you,

816
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,143
so the idea,

817
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,460
just to get back to this idea of
like where do thoughts come from?

818
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,460
Well if you,

819
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:43,010
if you take things out of the temporal
perspective and look at things as some

820
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:43,850
unified whole,

821
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:46,430
and by temporal you
mean present and future.

822
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:46,790
Okay.

823
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,370
So let's look at the whole thing
is like from the perspective,

824
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:53,840
if we could jump out of time and we
could look at whatever this event was,

825
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,430
let's call it the big bang for now and
the series of reactions that happened

826
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,420
directly after the Big Bang and those
first few seconds that the people at the

827
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:04,370
particle accelerators want to understand.

828
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,810
And then you follow that all the
way to the condensation of gas,

829
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:10,310
I guess that made matter.

830
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:12,110
An event in the galaxies and the Gat.

831
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,660
And then you follow all
the way that to the first,

832
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,430
uh,

833
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,740
uh,

834
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,410
mix chemical soup that whatever that was.

835
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:20,390
And then the DNA starts
forming out of that.

836
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:24,830
And then that DNA somehow
gets encapsulated in a
membrane and we have cells in

837
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:27,380
the cells gain symbiotic relationships
with other sounds and become

838
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,150
multicellular organisms,

839
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:30,770
which have symbiotic relationships.

840
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,570
And eventually you end up with us.

841
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,780
We still are at basically a DNA trail
going all the way back to before DNA to

842
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:38,811
matter,

843
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:40,940
all the way back to
this explosion of light.

844
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,860
And so a thought is an idea
of emerging from infinity,

845
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,110
from the ultimate explosion.

846
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,560
The trillions of years ago
and to the present moment.

847
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:51,951
Now,

848
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,210
if that ain't come in from nowhere,

849
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:54,290
I don't know what it is.

850
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,191
You can say,

851
00:25:55,191 --> 00:25:55,491
well no,

852
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:56,870
it's my neurons that did it.

853
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:56,961
Well,

854
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:58,670
your neurons did it right now,

855
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,590
but you're a chain of super reactions
that led to this moment in time when you

856
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:04,940
invented the thing you invented,

857
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,480
right.

858
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:05,751
You know,

859
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:07,040
you're not just your neurons,

860
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:12,041
you're connected to that an
entire ecosystem and you're
connected to a infinite

861
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:13,184
past,

862
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:13,701
you know,

863
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:14,270
and it's just,

864
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,740
I guess when you start looking at things,

865
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,490
it just,

866
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,210
you know,

867
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,840
there's your 60 year lifespan,

868
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,820
I suppose things can start looking
pretty grim and Penn and teller nourish.

869
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,120
But if you really just step out of time
and really look at what's going down,

870
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:26,570
it's like,

871
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,620
it's fucking crazy,

872
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:28,400
man.

873
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,140
We got blasted out of some infinite passed
and we're like yapping about it right

874
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:33,620
now.

875
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:33,760
It

876
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,111
really,

877
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:36,630
it just keeps going over and over and
over and over and over and over again.

878
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:39,060
Can I tell you my new
theory of reincarnation?

879
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:39,894
Yes.

880
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,990
And it's really intense because I
thought at this and it freaked me out.

881
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,280
It's pretty horrible.

882
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,060
So it's like that common
idea of reincarnation.

883
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:51,990
If you subscribe to the theory is
that you die and you're born again.

884
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:53,130
You go through your childhood,

885
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,230
did you grow up and then you die.

886
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,670
Maybe you get born as a cat,

887
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,720
maybe a butterfly,

888
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,080
right?

889
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,913
Maybe an Amoeba.

890
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,240
This is what I was thinking.

891
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,300
Cause I had a dream once and
in this dream I was a kid,

892
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,560
a little girl,

893
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,460
and my mom was rubbing my
head and I knew I was dying,

894
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,960
but I didn't know what that meant except
I knew it was bad and I could kind of

895
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:17,340
feel myself fading out.

896
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,970
There was this like white sort of thing
happening and then I woke up out of the

897
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:21,361
dream like,

898
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:21,841
fuck,

899
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:22,860
what is shitty dream?

900
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,930
So I was thinking like,

901
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:25,883
Oh fuck,

902
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,630
what if that's what reincarnation is.

903
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,950
What if when you die,

904
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,290
you know when you're
driving home one night,

905
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,990
you've had too many part lollipops.

906
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,520
You're listening to coast to coast.

907
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,280
Someone says something shocking that
makes you look away from the road.

908
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,420
You swerve off,

909
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:40,620
you slam into a tree,

910
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,783
you wake up,

911
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,500
you're here back in your house like,

912
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:44,071
Oh fuck,

913
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:44,970
what is shitty dream,

914
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,470
but you've really died.

915
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:49,200
You just re-incarnated again
into an ultimate reality,

916
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,280
an alternate reality,

917
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:52,110
so you literally can't die.

918
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,580
There's no break.

919
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,090
This just goes on forever
and ever and ever and ever.

920
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,170
No break,

921
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,370
no stopping,

922
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:00,360
no new age.

923
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,720
Going into the light and seeing your
parents and your family and taking a,

924
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,040
going into some new age,

925
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,330
a cosmic spa where you get to
shake off all your shitty Karma.

926
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,530
It never stops.

927
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,180
It just keeps happening again.

928
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:12,630
Again,

929
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,900
maybe like right now there's an earthquake
and the ceiling collapses and all of

930
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:19,140
a sudden you're just some
daydreaming cabby and Boston like,

931
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:19,381
wow,

932
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,550
that was fucking weird.

933
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:23,400
I was just imagining I
was a comedian in la,

934
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,550
but you know what I mean?

935
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:24,691
Well,

936
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:25,470
that's bizarre.

937
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,610
You're going to change lives.

938
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,840
You just snap and do another [inaudible]
become the guy rides his body out.

939
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,051
Yeah.

940
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:33,080
You snap into an alternate
life with all your

941
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,310
memories embedded,

942
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,980
everything already embedded in
there because it's an infinite,

943
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,843
it's an infinite,

944
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,160
this,

945
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,390
the,

946
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:38,730
the,

947
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:38,990
Oh,

948
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,070
it goes on forever.

949
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,160
What if your consciousness is living a
bunch of different lives simultaneously

950
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,090
and you just can't,

951
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,960
you can't see them.

952
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,181
Yeah.

953
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:45,561
It's like a,

954
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:48,530
an office filled with cubicles and no
one's poking their head over the top of

955
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:48,951
the cubicle.

956
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:49,251
Yeah,

957
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:49,550
right.

958
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,860
We're all rolling at the same time.

959
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,150
Yeah.

960
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,400
Or like the way I thought
about it is like if you're,

961
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:54,360
if there was like some,

962
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:54,580
this,

963
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,560
it sounds really crazy,

964
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:58,020
but imagine that each of your fingers,

965
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:58,854
it sounds insane,

966
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,370
but imagine like each of your fingers
had their own personality and their own

967
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,380
like consciousness or something.

968
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,130
It's like,

969
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,150
and you could stick them through some
kind of hole where they would forget they

970
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,940
were attached to your hand and they
would just think that they were their own

971
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,080
individual selves.

972
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:13,711
You know what I mean?

973
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,450
Like maybe that's what we are.

974
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:19,470
We're just like little fingers protruding
into this dimension from some infinite

975
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:20,040
thing.

976
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,400
But the product of protruding into
this dimension as we get instantaneous

977
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:27,840
amnesia and part of like dealing with a
shock of coming into this dimension is

978
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:30,870
we forget our true identity and
replace it with our ego structure.

979
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:31,930
Good.

980
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,470
We'll do it a four minutes and 14 seconds.

981
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,030
We'll just end this
because it's fascinating.

982
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:35,361
By the way,

983
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:38,360
I'm not dissing this guy at all and
I fucking love this music and I love,

984
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,490
I love his song and I
love that kind of music.

985
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,050
I like it a lot.

986
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,070
Toby Keith Song,

987
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,181
I don't have anything wrong.

988
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,370
A patriotic songs at the end of it,

989
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:49,270
listen to sky does this little speech
and this is like this old old dude that's

990
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:49,421
like,

991
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:50,254
hello my country.

992
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,810
I love my guns,

993
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,453
I love my payment,

994
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,560
I left the way it is now and anybody
that tried to change it has to come

995
00:29:58,561 --> 00:29:58,711
through.

996
00:29:58,711 --> 00:29:59,544
Mate,

997
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,690
I should be on our head.

998
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,550
Jeez is this is America and a country
boy is good enough from make sense?

999
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,610
Okay,

1000
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,880
play that back again because that
might be a terrorist message.

1001
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,661
Okay.

1002
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:12,210
That re retarded fucking

1003
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,581
speech.

1004
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:13,031
Back it up.

1005
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:13,240
Read it.

1006
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,260
Listeners listen to us.

1007
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,251
Is that a bag?

1008
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,084
Listen,

1009
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,163
I love my country.

1010
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,730
I love my guns.

1011
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,373
I love my family.

1012
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,660
I left the way it is now and anybody that
tried to change it has to come through

1013
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,494
me.

1014
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,770
That's for music or entity.

1015
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,740
That should be all of our answers.

1016
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,880
That's this is America and a cut.

1017
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,160
Your goal is good enough to make

1018
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,040
country boys good enough for me.

1019
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:40,020
Like we are as evolved as I need.

1020
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,490
Let's stop right here.

1021
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,630
Anybody else talk and if you
can listen to a cancer cell.

1022
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:46,560
That's what I sound like.

1023
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,860
It's just so fucking stupid.

1024
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,330
It's like a little more guns.

1025
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,193
Oh,

1026
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,720
that's you.

1027
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:53,861
Oh,

1028
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:54,630
I love my country.

1029
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,463
I love my guns.

1030
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,340
Oh Jesus.

1031
00:30:56,341 --> 00:30:56,511
Dude.

1032
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:58,380
Just hurry up and die
when you fucking hurry up.

1033
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,200
You fucking modeled t human being.

1034
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,760
You dip shit.

1035
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,983
Just die.

1036
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,380
Oh,

1037
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,130
love my family.

1038
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,030
I love my guns.

1039
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,081
Broad troughs.

1040
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:07,620
Take those.

1041
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,453
They'll come to me.

1042
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,160
I'll take a look.

1043
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,560
I'm not saying I don't
want to take your guns,

1044
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:11,060
dude.

1045
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,400
All right.

1046
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,780
I don't want to talk about guns too.

1047
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,910
I love my family too.

1048
00:31:13,911 --> 00:31:14,281
All right.

1049
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:16,370
Settle the fuck down
every time in history,

1050
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:16,860
Christ,

1051
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,030
every time in history,

1052
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,900
no one's coming through you,

1053
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:19,230
bro.

1054
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,850
But every period in history,

1055
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,170
he's got those human anchors desperately
trying to dig their claws into that

1056
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,610
fucking in into the earth and
keep evolution from happening.

1057
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,211
Desperately.

1058
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:30,550
Fight.

1059
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,500
They'll kill for it.

1060
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,350
They'll kill for acquisition.

1061
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,260
What do you mean?

1062
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,093
Wait a minute.

1063
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,270
You can't be serious.

1064
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:36,840
Do you?

1065
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,810
Everyone gathered round.

1066
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,270
Did you hear Galileo?

1067
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,330
Did you hear what Galileo just said?

1068
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,780
Father,

1069
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,660
he said that hurt.

1070
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,570
He speak.

1071
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,490
I love my earth in the
center of the universe.

1072
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,120
Earth.

1073
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,280
I love my sticks and bows and arrows.

1074
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:53,730
I love,

1075
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,960
I love Burt's ears.

1076
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,040
I love my slang.

1077
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,150
I love my slave.

1078
00:31:57,151 --> 00:31:57,910
I love my love.

1079
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,311
Hornen,

1080
00:31:58,311 --> 00:32:00,660
which is anybody tried
to take my catapult away.

1081
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,831
I'll come through me.

1082
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:03,240
I love my scroll.

1083
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,720
I love my car.

1084
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,240
I love carving in rock.

1085
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:06,630
Oh,

1086
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,470
I love walking.

1087
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,020
I don't need to ride any horses.

1088
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,410
I don't need domesticated animals.

1089
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:11,760
That's complicated.

1090
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,050
Nobody wants to domesticate.

1091
00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:13,950
Horse has got to come through me.

1092
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,720
I love being a hunter gatherer.

1093
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,290
I love having a lifespan
of a single cell organisms.

1094
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,060
We're all having a good time down
here at the bottom of the ocean floor.

1095
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,470
Anybody wants to change that?

1096
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,313
It's got to come through me.

1097
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,050
I love being a carbon molecule.

1098
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,410
I love exists in the
pre big bang conditions.

1099
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,030
Hello family 11 but it wants

1100
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,610
to change that.
