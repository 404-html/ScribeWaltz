1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:01,871
All right,

2
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:02,704
we're live.

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,421
First of all,

4
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:04,710
thank you very much for coming.

5
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,640
I really appreciate it.

6
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:05,961
Well,

7
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:06,780
if I get the hell man,

8
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,140
man,

9
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,240
looking forward to it for a long time.

10
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,270
I am as well.

11
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,900
I enjoyed our conversation in
New York City two years ago now.

12
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:13,380
Right?

13
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,400
It was a fun time and um,

14
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,660
I've been a big fan of your work for a
long time before that and I find you a

15
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:23,110
fascinating character and I'm glad you.

16
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:24,990
I mean you got up early this morning,

17
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,010
English time.

18
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,800
It's 8:00 here in Los Angeles,

19
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:29,650
so this is like,

20
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,500
what do you like eight hours ahead of us?

21
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,543
So we're talking to a,

22
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,830
to even out for awhile fella.

23
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,660
This is not good for life expectancy,

24
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,140
right?

25
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,580
This is certainly true.

26
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:38,800
People.

27
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,633
Let's play this out.

28
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,710
I think another thing that I do
that are probably not good for me,

29
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,550
that's the one,

30
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:45,450
and I'll get enough sleep.

31
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,281
Don't get enough sleep.

32
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,590
And you like the booze fella that.

33
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:49,640
Well that may be good for me.

34
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:50,240
You never know.

35
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,320
Really moderation in moderation.

36
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,193
Yeah.

37
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,750
While we're drinking it right now,

38
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,830
a little Jack Daniels,

39
00:00:57,831 --> 00:00:59,060
is that supposed to be good for colds?

40
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,521
Does that.

41
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:00,800
A man is working for me.

42
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,400
Okay.

43
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,091
It does work for you.

44
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:02,480
Really.

45
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,080
It helps you.

46
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,480
It certainly does whatever
makes you feel better.

47
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,440
Um,

48
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,580
you're involved at the.

49
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,770
For folks who don't know Aubrey de Grey,

50
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,150
you're a researcher at Cambridge.

51
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:12,200
You were involved.

52
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Very much so in the forefront
of anti aging life extension.

53
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,120
As far as medical science is concerned,

54
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,470
you're at the forefront of this.

55
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:24,820
So actually,

56
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,510
first of all,

57
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,871
correct.

58
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:26,590
One thing,

59
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,470
I haven't been affiliated
with the University of
Cambridge for a very long time

60
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:29,650
now.

61
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,483
How long has it been?

62
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,730
Fucking wikipedia tells assholes.

63
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,910
Two thousand six or something like that.

64
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,550
Yeah,

65
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,690
I mean basically the same as we were able
to bring enough funding to be able to

66
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,880
pay me a full time salary.

67
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,590
It made most sense for me to know actually
we're doing something else to pay the

68
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:48,424
bill.

69
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,620
So what is your organization now?

70
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,550
So sensory fetched foundation
where if I a one C,

71
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:56,890
three public charity in mountain view,

72
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:58,930
California and we,

73
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,850
uh,

74
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,300
a level of roughly $5,000,000
per year in terms of our budget,

75
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,370
so we're still really pretty small,

76
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:07,960
but I think we spend it pretty well.

77
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,030
And for folks who said
what's wrong with his voice,

78
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,250
he's suffering from a
bit of a cold right now.

79
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:13,030
Ladies and gentlemen,

80
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,380
that's why he's drinking the whiskey.

81
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,700
I don't know how it works that way.

82
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:16,631
What,

83
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:17,464
what is,

84
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,120
what's exciting right now in terms of
like medical research when it comes to

85
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,110
life extension,

86
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:23,620
like what are,

87
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,440
what are the exciting
areas to you're pursuing?

88
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Perhaps the most exciting thing is
that no one exciting thing they really

89
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:37,441
important thing to understand
about medical research
into aging is to start out

90
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:41,380
from remembering that aging
is not just one phenomenon.

91
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,520
It's a collection,

92
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,470
a network of interacting phenomena,

93
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,300
and the way that it's going to be
effectively tackled by medicine in the

94
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:53,110
fullness of time is by a
divide and conquer strategy.

95
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:54,490
A panel of interventions,

96
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:58,180
all of which need to work with me really
well in order for the whole nfs to

97
00:02:58,181 --> 00:02:59,014
actually work,

98
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,010
um,

99
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,460
to an appreciable degree
in terms of Perth Berman,

100
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,310
devel health.

101
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,470
So from my point of view,

102
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm working at the coalface,

103
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,743
so to speak.

104
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,640
It's a fantastic thing that,

105
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,523
you know,

106
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,360
there's always something every week
there's something that's got a new

107
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,530
breakthrough here in that.

108
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,230
But of course the breakthroughs
are often very technical.

109
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,650
There are often things
that only specialists would
understand that they actually

110
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:21,510
were breakthroughs.

111
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,181
They're not like,

112
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:22,391
you know,

113
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,260
we haven't doubled the mice,

114
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,020
the lifespan of mice in the past week,

115
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,913
for example.

116
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,653
Nevertheless,

117
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,280
that's fine.

118
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,520
You know,

119
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,850
I mean,

120
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,720
that's how pioneering technology has
always developed and the people that do

121
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:35,740
need to understand,

122
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,281
in other words,

123
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:40,120
the people who are doing the research
and who need to know about each other's

124
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,210
results in order to know
what experiment to do next.

125
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,330
You know that that community obviously
is sufficiently cohesive that these

126
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,070
pieces of information are distributed.

127
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,050
I obviously play a large part in doing
that as well as in actually overseeing

128
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,000
the research that the foundation does.

129
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,230
So,

130
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,063
um,

131
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,323
you know,

132
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,180
coming back to my original statement,

133
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,350
there's no one answer,

134
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,050
um,

135
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,710
but they,

136
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,980
that's a very good point because is
there a lot of cooperation between the

137
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:14,240
various different individuals
all throughout the world
are working on these life

138
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:17,750
extension technologies and
life extension medical science.

139
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,230
So that's actually a totally different
question to which the answer is

140
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:22,220
depressingly different.

141
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,383
Um,

142
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,850
the failed,

143
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,890
the individual failed that I think all
need to be developed to a reasonable

144
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,591
degree of efficacy in order to actually
give the overall result that individual

145
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:40,190
failed a nightly cohesive and people
talk to each other within the field.

146
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,660
But between the failed,

147
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,070
it's a very different matter.

148
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,650
One of the things that I've had to do,

149
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,930
everything that I
started out in this area,

150
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,190
and certainly over the past,

151
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:50,510
let's say 10 or 12 years,

152
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,600
I've had to actively bring
these people together,

153
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,610
the far too much balkanization
building up of silos and of,

154
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,011
you know,

155
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:02,810
unnecessary barriers between field
that somehow don't think that they're

156
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:03,920
relevant to each other.

157
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,710
And this happens not in any way.

158
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:11,711
I'm not blaming the scientists for that
because it happens rarely as a result of

159
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,580
the vagaries of funding.

160
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,830
The fact that nobody's got enough money
and therefore in order to get whatever

161
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:19,664
they can,

162
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,300
they've got to focus on the things
that are already known to be good at.

163
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,120
It works extraordinarily
strongly against the um,

164
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,151
uh,

165
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:33,230
the portability of cross disciplinary
work and also against high risk,

166
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:34,160
high gain work.

167
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,310
And it really massively flow
science and technology down.

168
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,920
So it's a tragedy and
everyone kind of knows it,

169
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,020
but nobody really knows
what to do about it.

170
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,470
It's not any one person's
interests to do anything about it.

171
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,690
So the whole system is perpetuated.

172
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,260
So is it one of those situations where
you have like various pharmaceutical

173
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:52,310
companies or what have you,

174
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,990
standing on the outside looking in,

175
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:57,690
waiting for something to be
something that they could

176
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,620
put their chips on something where
they can hedge their bets and say,

177
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:01,861
okay,

178
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,331
this is a,

179
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:04,950
this is a promising little
piece of research here.

180
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:09,360
Now we'll start to gamble on this being
profitable down the line because for

181
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,390
medication especially to be ultimately
profitable is there's a huge period of

182
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,380
testing and research and ultimately can
cost millions and millions of dollars

183
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,830
before you could ever even find
out the efficacy of a product.

184
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,130
That's exactly right.

185
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,761
And again,

186
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:26,770
if not quite the same thing
as I was thinking about it,

187
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,220
but it's related when I was talking
about earlier was really with respect to

188
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:31,320
academia per se,

189
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,510
with respect to people who rely on
government funding to get worked on the

190
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,410
pharmaceutical industry or more generally
the medical industry have a different

191
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:42,244
perspective,

192
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,290
but it kind of has the
same kind of problem.

193
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,400
Um,

194
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,930
medicine is tricky to do and everyone
wants to keep it as simple as possible,

195
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,630
which means the inherent bias against,

196
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,703
um,

197
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,220
against cross disciplinary work,

198
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,600
against a divide and conquer strategy
that involved doing more than one thing at

199
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,160
the same time to the same person,

200
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,450
but ultimately we're going to have to
bite that bullet and there are smart

201
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:11,080
people in the pharmaceutical and medical
industry just as there are in academia

202
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,810
and everyone kind of getting used to this.

203
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,110
It's just that it's a very difficult
thing for anyone to be the first group,

204
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:20,801
the first company,

205
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:21,580
the first place,

206
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,510
first referred group to actually do it.

207
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:28,720
Kind of got to be a
collective shift of mindset.

208
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,500
I kind of sea change in the
culture of how all this is done.

209
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,330
So is this something that's being
actively pursued all over the world?

210
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,750
Are there pockets of intellectuals
that are working on this or

211
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,201
all over the world,

212
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:42,340
but yet only pockets.

213
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,740
I'm afraid at this point there
is still an enormous tendency,

214
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,890
enormously productive tendency to
retreat into doing what just makes money

215
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:57,790
quickly and what get papers published
quickly irrespective of whether it's Gals,

216
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,361
in other words,

217
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:02,590
whether it leads to significant
progress in the longer term.

218
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,880
So,

219
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,121
uh,

220
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:08,970
the biggest thing that I always point
to if they absolutely biologically

221
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,670
inaccurate and damaging idea that the
diseases of old age or in farm fence

222
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:19,330
distinct from aging itself,

223
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,900
it's complete nonsense
that leaves about eight.

224
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Anything that causes people who were
born a long time ago to be fair,

225
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,290
but it doesn't tend to affect
people who are in early adulthood.

226
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,670
Those things are that way because
they are side effect of being alive.

227
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,080
They are side effects of having been
alive and accumulating damage for a long

228
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:42,010
time in the body.

229
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,410
And that is the only thing that one can
fire the definition of aging itself to.

230
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,070
So one should not be dividing these
two things and saying the things that

231
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,450
disease and this other thing,

232
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:53,170
if not,

233
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,160
we shouldn't be doing that.

234
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,010
And if we doing that,

235
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,370
then we've got a chance of
actually understanding how
to attack the this network

236
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:07,140
of interacting l health issues that
affect the elderly in a manner that really

237
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:07,974
works.

238
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,750
We will stop trying to be over optimistic
about these things that we choose to

239
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,100
call to.

240
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,710
They've learned over pessimistic about
the things that we don't and we'll start

241
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:19,500
to realize that all of them
together can be tackled.

242
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,150
So you're looking at aging
itself as a type of a disease.

243
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,100
I would actually go the other way.

244
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,900
I would say that the right thing to do
is not to look at the local diseases of

245
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,910
old age diseases because of course
there is a huge distinction between the,

246
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,700
between things that are side effect
of being alive in the first place,

247
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:41,160
on the one hand and infections,

248
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,230
infections or what the word disease
should be restricted to infections and

249
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,730
congenital diseases that we say,

250
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,023
um,

251
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,470
infections can be actually eliminated
from the body that can be cured by bashing

252
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:57,810
away at the symptoms and
eliminating the infectious itunes.

253
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,381
Now,

254
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:01,710
if you try to do that with something
that's a side effect of being alive,

255
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,960
you're obviously not going to succeed
unless you like go as far as eliminating

256
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,831
being alive,

257
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:09,240
which you'd rather defeat the object.

258
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,020
Right.

259
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,401
So,

260
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:10,920
um,

261
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,020
so you know,

262
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,260
that's the,

263
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,730
that's the conceptual thing that people
think that something like outside of or

264
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:23,210
atherosclerosis or cancer is basically
just not all that different from

265
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,950
tuberculosis complete bullshit.

266
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,040
And that fundamental conceptual error
causes enormous amount of money to be

267
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:36,531
spent in the wrong way against the
diseases of old age in ways that will only

268
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,450
ever make a very minimal
impact on the disease.

269
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,471
So is that,

270
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,450
that there's sort of a resignation,

271
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,250
that Alzheimer's is just
a side effect of old age,

272
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:46,680
that there's nothing they can do about.

273
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,100
Ah,

274
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,770
well no,

275
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,060
no,

276
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,740
the is not a resignation.

277
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:51,270
People say it's a disease,

278
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:53,240
therefore we should not on your part.

279
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,170
But I mean that's the problem that people
think they can cure it in isolation.

280
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,580
They think,

281
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:58,750
oh,

282
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,790
it's people get old,

283
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,653
but let's kill it.

284
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,080
So what you're saying is what we
have to cure is the getting old part.

285
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:04,860
That's right.

286
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,500
Okay.

287
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:05,870
What are,

288
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,703
what's.

289
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,760
What do you think will
be the method ultimately,

290
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:10,410
and obviously there's a
bunch of different ideas.

291
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,470
What do you think will be the method
ultimately that we move into that

292
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,070
direction?

293
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,070
It's been very clear to me for at least
15 years now that the way to do this is

294
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,160
damage repair,

295
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,050
that we must develop a
panel of intervention,

296
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,060
the panel of therapies which go in
and restore the molecular and cellular

297
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,600
structure and composition of
the body of an elderly person.

298
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,260
To her it was more or
less in early adulthood,

299
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,650
so that means things like putting cells
back when the body is having fellows

300
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:47,100
dying and not being not being
automatically replaced by cell division.

301
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,980
It means taking sales away
when cells are dividing,

302
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:51,960
when they're not supposed to
or when they're not dying,

303
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,050
when they are supposed to.

304
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,240
It means cleaning out molecular waste
products if they're accumulating because

305
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,960
they saw the body doesn't
know how to get rid of them,

306
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,120
doesn't know how to break
them down or to excavate them.

307
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,260
You know,

308
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,850
pretty basic things really,

309
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,160
but it turns out that even thinking in
that it sounds like a very simplistic

310
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:12,910
way.

311
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,910
It's a very robust framework for actually
identifying what needs to be fixed and

312
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,714
how to fix it.

313
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,810
Do you think that diet,

314
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:27,790
it all plays a part in this or do you
recommend a specific diet to people to

315
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,580
enhance their their body's
ability to repair itself?

316
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,320
I don't really do that
first for two reasons.

317
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,490
First of all,

318
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,580
with regard to data and a
more generally lifestyle,

319
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,950
anything that people can do today,

320
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,060
I definitely take the view that there
are plenty of other people who know more

321
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:46,100
about the me and the four.

322
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,990
If I also became an expert in this area,

323
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:51,230
I really wouldn't be making as much
difference as I am making by spending my

324
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:52,460
time in this other way.

325
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,390
Second thing is that,

326
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,390
and this is rather depressing,

327
00:12:56,391 --> 00:13:01,220
but it's rather an important thing to
mention that as far as we can tell,

328
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:05,330
the overwhelming evidence is that none
of these things make very much difference

329
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:06,164
to most people.

330
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,270
It feel an unlucky person.

331
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:13,271
If you're someone who drew the short
Straw and you are aging unusually rapidly,

332
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,750
then it's a bit different.

333
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,560
Um,

334
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,690
especially if you're
aging unusually rapidly,

335
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:23,170
only in one particular
way or one or two ways.

336
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,510
Then maybe there are supplements or
dietary or lifestyle regimen that will

337
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:33,770
substantially normalize your rate of
aging and that's obviously a good thing,

338
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,470
but for those of us who
are already average,

339
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,080
especially for those of us who are
already doing better than average,

340
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,130
that's not the case.

341
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,160
The evidence seems to be that
these interventions simply
don't give you anymore.

342
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:50,230
The body is already as well tuned as it
can be subject only to the development

343
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,410
of much more sophisticated interventions
of the thought that sensory research

344
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,550
foundation is working on.

345
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,220
So the things like getting good sleep,

346
00:13:58,221 --> 00:13:59,180
getting good diet,

347
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,340
they're really essentially only one

348
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,263
go so far.

349
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,170
There are only going to
go very familial out.

350
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:03,790
That's right.

351
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,623
So you'll have a.

352
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,930
we'll live an extra 10
years or sometimes even 10.

353
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,490
I think an overstatement,

354
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:11,800
I think we're talking like more
like one or two if you're lucky.

355
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,060
One or two.

356
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,350
So he pulls it up.

357
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,184
Folks,

358
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,970
here's a,

359
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,940
here's a good illustration of this.

360
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,610
People often around the rest of the world,

361
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,150
you know,

362
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,770
people laugh at the Ufa a lot for it,

363
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:30,450
for the fact that even though it spans
a huge amount of medical care far more

364
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,040
ahead than any other country.

365
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,001
Nevertheless,

366
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,650
if you look at longevity,

367
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,440
uh,

368
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,100
the USA is way down the leg table.

369
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,200
It's like number 45 or
something like that.

370
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,513
Ridiculous.

371
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,691
People say,

372
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:44,140
well,

373
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,690
this is just so you know,

374
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,833
that

375
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,810
that money doesn't buy
health or something.

376
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,290
But actually a much more important
message comes if you look at the real

377
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,150
numbers,

378
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,350
not just the league table,

379
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,960
it's something I'd like to ask you,

380
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:00,990
just if you know that.

381
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,210
What do you think the
difference is between the life
expectancy of people in the

382
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,370
USA and the life expectancy
of people in Japan?

383
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,750
The longest live country in the world?

384
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,640
I would say the life expectancy,

385
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,350
the United States is probably
a good average is probably
in your sixties where I

386
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,600
would say Japan is
probably in your seventies,

387
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,943
so I'll give you a number.

388
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,390
Sixty four,

389
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,170
78.

390
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:25,750
How about that?

391
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,090
You say you're going to say 14 years.

392
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,073
Yes.

393
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,033
Four years.

394
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,260
Four full full.

395
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,580
It's not much.

396
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,413
That's right.

397
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,201
That's my point.

398
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,580
And the for the last four,

399
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,211
really,

400
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:37,044
you can have them.

401
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,563
Well,

402
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,690
of course the left foil you can.

403
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,280
It's the same in Japan.

404
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,240
A long time if to stay healthy
long time first and then the.

405
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:47,850
The,

406
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,320
the period of decline
is typically about fame.

407
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,620
However long the period of
good health was beforehand.

408
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,410
So in all these factors that
people look to to enhance like,

409
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,010
you know,

410
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,570
surround yourself with loved ones,

411
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:01,040
have a good community,

412
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,430
but do something that you enjoy
doing it when they're talking.

413
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,680
They're really only talking
about a very small amount of time

414
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,553
anyway.

415
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,750
The reason I spent so much
time emphasizing this and
making sure that people

416
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,630
understand it is because
if people don't understand,

417
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,770
if people think well,

418
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:20,180
they can do a great deal to post the oral
health just by doing things that they

419
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,380
can do already,

420
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,320
then they're going to be
correspondingly less enthusiastic,

421
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:28,790
less committed to figuring out and
helping and hastening the development of

422
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,230
things that we can't do already.

423
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,651
Of course,

424
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,040
the sort of stuff that I'm working on,

425
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,540
it's really because the impact of things
that we can do today so small that it

426
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,400
becomes urgent to develop new things.

427
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,690
What do you think will be the
method for repairing damage?

428
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,360
I mean how?

429
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,650
How will that find itself in our lives?

430
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,200
There are many different types of debt
and the only reason why it was possible

431
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:56,440
for me to come up with a really solid,

432
00:16:56,441 --> 00:17:01,441
robust clinical research
program was because 15 years
ago I was able to identify

433
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,700
a way to classify.

434
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:07,480
They've many types of damage into a much
more manageable number of categories.

435
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,440
Just seven categories within the law.

436
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Within each category there is just one
generic intervention which may differ in

437
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:20,140
detail from one example within
the category to another,

438
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,460
but early in detail.

439
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,090
So basically we're talking about
and seven different types of repair.

440
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,430
So for illustration,

441
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:31,990
let me just talk about when I
tell them I'm one type of damages,

442
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,831
loss of cells,

443
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:37,831
cells dying and not being automatically
replaced by the division of other cells.

444
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,310
That basically the reason why
we get Parkinson's disease.

445
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,840
That's probably the best example of it.

446
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:44,920
Most obvious example,

447
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,860
I'm now in Parkinson's disease.

448
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,600
What happens is there's just one part
of the brain called the substantia Nigra

449
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,920
in which there are a special type of
neuron called dopaminergic neurons.

450
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,210
These neurons die much more rapidly
than neurons in most parts of the brain,

451
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,280
and sure enough eventually they have
enough of them now and most of us,

452
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,880
you've already lost about 20
percent of guys near by old age,

453
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,230
but some people live a little bit faster
and then maybe a last 70 or 80 percent

454
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,860
intellegence.

455
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,990
Those are the people that
got Parkinson's disease,

456
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,770
so then they asked what
is the damage repair?

457
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,950
The onset,

458
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,980
it's actually really clear
and well known in this case,

459
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,780
namely stem cell therapy.

460
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,180
That's what stem cell therapy is you,

461
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,950
but excuse me,

462
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,060
you put cells into the body
that are prepared in advance,

463
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,621
so to speak.

464
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:39,621
They're set up so that they will have
the tendency to divide and transform into

465
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,650
replacements for the cells that the
body was not replacing lights out.

466
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,990
So you restore the number
of cells in the tissue.

467
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,460
Does she started working again?

468
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,930
You've fixed the disease and about 20
years ago people started trying this

469
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:56,040
because people realize this didn't really
work too well back that and it worked

470
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:56,874
occasionally,

471
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,070
but the basic problem was we didn't
know enough about how to manipulate stem

472
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:04,230
cells before injecting them into the body.

473
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,580
Now we know a lot,

474
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,170
lot more and there are new stem cell
trials for Parkinson's disease starting up

475
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:10,890
now,

476
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,050
which people are really
optimistic about it.

477
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,460
I think there's a very good chance,

478
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:18,960
I would say even a 50 slash 50 chance
that we will be able to say in as little

479
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,040
as 10 years from now,

480
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,450
the Parkinson's disease has
genuinely been cured with them.

481
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:24,260
South therapy.

482
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,681
Wow.

483
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:26,270
That is very promising.

484
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:27,230
That's incredible.

485
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,190
Ten years.

486
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,350
That's a relatively short amount of time.

487
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,323
Unless your.

488
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,450
It is 74.

489
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,400
Yeah,

490
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,210
right.

491
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,890
It a short amount of time.

492
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,180
A lot of the therapies that we think also
need to be developed to address other

493
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,950
part of aging.

494
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,090
I think harder than that and I think we
could be talking about 20 or 25 years

495
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,110
and even then we're only
talking about a 50 slash 50.

496
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,380
A probability of getting
there for anything that's
more than a few years away.

497
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,240
It's obviously extremely speculative.

498
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,650
If we're talking about timeframes,

499
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,030
I think we have a responsibility
to give her a bath,

500
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,060
get to the general public because the
general public's bath guest is going to be

501
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:08,900
a lot worth.

502
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,830
Right.

503
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,390
And you've got to know,

504
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,590
you've got to have some kind of idea
of how close something in order to

505
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:20,120
understand how much to agitate
to make it happen faster,

506
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,880
you know,

507
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,460
mean a thousand years away.

508
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:26,390
It's not going to be a priority
to make it only 990 years away.

509
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,553
Right.

510
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,340
Um,

511
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,880
so that's,

512
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,790
that's a big part of why we to
talk about these timeframes.

513
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,391
But yes,

514
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:35,100
I mean I think there's at least a 10
percent chance that we won't get there for

515
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,020
a hundred years.

516
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,560
Wow.

517
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,270
That's no big deal,

518
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:39,540
right?

519
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,390
Because 50 percent challenge is quite
enough to be worth fighting for.

520
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,080
Most.

521
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,913
Certainly.

522
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,040
You and I met at the global two,

523
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,090
what

524
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:48,251
is it?

525
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:48,530
20,

526
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,580
45 initiative event in New York City,

527
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,710
which is a group of sort of a,

528
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,050
a group of two different groups of people.

529
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,950
There's people that are
concerned with biological aging,

530
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,330
which is your group medical,

531
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,164
biological aging,

532
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,000
and these people that some folks
classify as a Psi Phi dreamers.

533
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,360
That belief you're going to be able to
download your consciousness into a robot

534
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:17,590
and bypass the whole biological process
in the first place and that all this

535
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,240
work about repair,

536
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:22,150
it's only going to be a moot point because
we're going to get to a point where

537
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:26,200
we're going to develop a body that's
far superior to the biological body that

538
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,760
we're born with and will simply,

539
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:29,200
in part our consciousness into that.

540
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,480
Do you give any credence to that?

541
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:34,450
Do you do dabble in that or do you
just concentrate on what you're doing?

542
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,330
I have a very open mind
about these things.

543
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,470
I'm not at all fun of people talking
about things that are clearly impossible,

544
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,120
but very often when I'm thinking initially
looked clearly impossible look left,

545
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,440
you understand that it might actually
already definitely really difficult,

546
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,260
or this could be an example.

547
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,590
Uploading is the idea of moving
world consciousness to a difference.

548
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,133
Hardware,

549
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:01,580
you know,

550
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,140
it's not completely clear
that it can't be done.

551
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,210
The May and the end be reasons
why it totally can't be done,

552
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,260
but I think all that really matters
now is that we can say that it's very

553
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:13,094
difficult.

554
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,630
I think that,

555
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,560
yeah,

556
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,270
I would certainly say in fact that

557
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,280
I bet serious money that the problem
with aging will be decisively solved by a

558
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:30,641
biomedical approach of the thought that
we're aware pursuing well before it gets

559
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,760
sold by an uploading a pro,

560
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,460
but here's the thing,

561
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,300
like a central technologist,

562
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,970
I know I might be wrong and therefore
I'm delighted that there are people

563
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:43,900
working in these other areas so further,

564
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,660
if they their work turned out to be easier
than I think it hit and my work turns

565
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:48,560
out to be harder,

566
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,140
that and they get their first,

567
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,460
then there'll be saving
lives that I couldn't save.

568
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,353
That works for me.

569
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:53,781
Now,

570
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:55,850
there's a philosophical debate here,

571
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,290
a philosophical conversation,

572
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,550
and that conversation is,

573
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,690
why would you want to continue?

574
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,060
How long do you truly want to live?

575
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,560
Do you want to live to be a thousand?

576
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,220
Do you want to live to be 100,000 years
and will that be an issue as well?

577
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,250
As far as national,

578
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,110
our national natural resources go.

579
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,591
I mean,

580
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:17,690
are we already overpopulated?

581
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,440
Are we already putting a tremendous
burden on the natural resources of this

582
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,980
planet that will be accentuated by a
thousand year old people just running

583
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:26,900
around having babies when
they're 900 years old.

584
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,070
So I'm going to hold for that
question in two very separate parts.

585
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,230
First we're going to talk about the so
called philosophical issue of how long

586
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:34,210
one would want to live.

587
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,890
I find that quite remarkable that people
worry about this simply because it's

588
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:44,800
not the way that people actually
think about anything else.

589
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,630
Let's remember that the longevity aspect
of all of this work is a side effect.

590
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,290
I don't work on longevity.

591
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,310
I don't.

592
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,460
I certainly don't work on immortality
the way you might think if you read the

593
00:23:58,461 --> 00:23:59,294
papers.

594
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,580
I just work on health.

595
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,600
I'm just interested in stopping people
from getting sick when they get older.

596
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,210
Now if you think about it,

597
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,620
all medicine is like that.

598
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,730
All medicine involves stopping people
from getting sick or fixing them up if

599
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:17,690
they are fake and old medicine has a
side effect that people live longer than

600
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:18,770
they otherwise would have done.

601
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,850
So the only real difference between the
work that sensory research foundation

602
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:27,851
does and the work that everything everyone
else in medical research does is a

603
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:28,730
difference of degree.

604
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:34,150
The fact that the longevity side effect
of our work may be substantially greater

605
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,010
than the longevity side effect
that we're familiar with.

606
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,690
It's still a side effect.

607
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,020
So if we come to the question of
how well I might want to live,

608
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,233
you know,

609
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,223
just like any,

610
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,250
even a meaningful question to me,

611
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,084
it's like saying,

612
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,660
what time would you like to
go to the toilet next Sunday?

613
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,973
You know,

614
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,060
we know that that's a dumb thing
to have an opinion about it.

615
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:00,070
A dumb thing to have an opinion about
because we know we're going to have more

616
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:03,530
information on the topic near at the
time and we're going to be able to act on

617
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:05,930
the information and it's the same deal.

618
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,950
You know,

619
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,060
nobody makes decisions on the basis
of how long ago they were bought.

620
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,140
People increasingly make decisions as
they get older on the basis of how long

621
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,880
they think they've got to live,

622
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,150
but that's because the amount of time
they think they've got to live with going

623
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:20,984
down,

624
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,820
which won't be going down anymore.

625
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,590
If you've got an arbitrary amount of time
behind you earn other arbitrary amount

626
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,560
of time ahead of you,

627
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,580
your decision making is going to be
based on more short term considerations,

628
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:32,180
you know,

629
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,440
like peer pressure.

630
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:34,080
And so,

631
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,460
you know,

632
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,293
as I point out,

633
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,980
when people ask me these
things oftentimes say,

634
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,353
okay,

635
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,200
take yourself back to the
first time you got laid.

636
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,800
Oh yeah.

637
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,180
Alright.

638
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,350
Now think about what you
were thinking at the time.

639
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,940
Were you thinking,

640
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:50,631
Oh my God,

641
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:51,051
Oh my God,

642
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,110
I have to get this person into bed right
now because I've only got another 60

643
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:55,070
years to live.

644
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,113
So what?

645
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,030
I mean it's just ridiculous.

646
00:25:59,570 --> 00:25:59,781
Okay,

647
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:02,690
so then I want to come to like
the second half of your question,

648
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,670
which was the business about
overpopulation and such.

649
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:07,720
Like this is I again,

650
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:08,040
I,

651
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,110
I recall somewhat at the idea that the.

652
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,510
He said for philosophical question to
me it's a psychological question and

653
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:15,344
that's not the same at all,

654
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,360
but without getting into semantics,

655
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,543
what is the answer?

656
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,730
I have a three level onset and this
applies to all of the questions were might

657
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,230
arrays with regard to the problems that
might hypothetically be created as a

658
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,680
consequences of solving the
problem we've got today.

659
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,533
The problem of writing,

660
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,573
right?

661
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,900
So first thing is specific answers.

662
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,530
Just let look at the actual scenario
closely rather than a knee jerk reaction

663
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:43,140
and say,

664
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,360
is the problem actually
let you to occur at all?

665
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:45,991
Now,

666
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:48,420
in the case of of the population,

667
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,910
what we have to ask ourselves,

668
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,490
okay,

669
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,490
how rapidly would the population actually
increase in the context of eliminating

670
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:00,480
death from aging and how
badly with that matter?

671
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,800
At the moment,

672
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,720
we've already got an
overpopulation problem.

673
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,250
We've got too many people on the planet.

674
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,510
We've got global warming and stuff.

675
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,470
Well,

676
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,640
why do we have global warming?

677
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:11,430
It's not because we have 7 billion people.

678
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,890
It's because we have 7 billion people,

679
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,780
all of whom are burning a lot of carbon
and that's not going to be true for very

680
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:19,140
long.

681
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,680
As we ramp up solar energy and we
invent nuclear fusion and so on,

682
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,980
you know the is going to
be in the relatively near
future a situation where we

683
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:34,491
increase the carrying capacity of the
planet a lot by these technologies that

684
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:38,100
mean that we can have more people
with less environmental impact.

685
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,700
It's very likely that
that kind of trajectory,

686
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,580
and of course I'm not only talking about
global warming here and talking about

687
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,890
all other types of
pollution that we engage in,

688
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,050
that kind of technology will out run
any changes that may happen in terms of

689
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:52,884
demography,

690
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,790
so that's the first level.

691
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,240
The second level answer is perhaps
more important to kind of general while

692
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,360
applies across the board,

693
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:03,660
whether it's other population you're
worried about or boredom or dictators

694
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:07,860
living forever or how will we pay the
pensions or any of the standard digit

695
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,703
reactions.

696
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,730
The answer is how bad could it be?

697
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,280
Let's have a sense of
proportion about this.

698
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,580
How bad could the problems be?

699
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,593
As a

700
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,030
relative to the severity of the problem
we have today and also ones that

701
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:24,391
question,

702
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:27,990
we have to remind ourselves exactly what
is the severity of the problem we have

703
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:28,824
today,

704
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,380
how many people die of aging every day?

705
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,210
The answer is 100,000 dollars and of
course most of them don't just die.

706
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,540
They die after a long period of disease
and debilitation and decrepitude a

707
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,070
decline and dependency in general misery.

708
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,550
So there is no question that aging is
responsible for the vast majority of human

709
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:52,770
suffering in the world today.

710
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,580
Not even if we don't even have to
restrict ourselves to the industrialized

711
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:57,414
world.

712
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,700
The overall,

713
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,530
I was asking you about
life expectancy earlier,

714
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,760
so saying like,

715
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,050
you know,

716
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,280
a four year difference
between the US and Japan.

717
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,780
Turns out there's only 10 years difference
between the world as a whole and

718
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,614
Japan.

719
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,530
Is that amazing or what?

720
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,411
That's pretty amazing.

721
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:15,870
So worst case scenario
and best case scenarios,

722
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,560
only 10 years.

723
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,090
Well not worse case average case.

724
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,570
Real worse than they are down
in the forties or fifties.

725
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,090
But worst case as far as global mean,

726
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,211
right?

727
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:24,390
Yeah,

728
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,223
exactly.

729
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:25,740
So,

730
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,280
so I mean,

731
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,630
what we're saying here is aging,

732
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:31,320
it's undoubtedly the world's worst
problem right now has been for a long time

733
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,690
and we have to ask,

734
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,360
you know,

735
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,280
even supposing,

736
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:39,360
but we ended up in a situation where
population was going to be a problem

737
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,580
because we hadn't invented technologies
fix that to increase the carrying

738
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,810
capacity of the planet quite
as rapidly as we needed to.

739
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,140
So we were faced with this rather
irritating feature of having to have fewer

740
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:54,740
children than we would like in order to
make room for all the elderly herstal

741
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,930
healthy and not dying.

742
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,580
How bad is that?

743
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,740
Seems to me it's hard.

744
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,090
It's hard to make a case that the right
thing to do would be to let the people

745
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:06,640
age and die rather than to your okay.

746
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,570
And the third level of answer is
perhaps the most decisive of all,

747
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,130
some level of.

748
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:12,461
I said,

749
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:12,640
well,

750
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,990
even if you've convinced yourself that
these problems are going to happen,

751
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:19,660
and even if you also convinced yourself
that these problems are going to be so

752
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:22,330
bad that they might outweigh
the problem that we're solving.

753
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:28,350
The question is who used to say who should
actually be making the decision as to

754
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,510
whether the therapy,

755
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:32,344
the years.

756
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,440
The answer clearly is humanity of the
future rather than humanity of the

757
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:38,284
precedent.

758
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,490
If we say to ourselves,

759
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:39,791
Oh dear,

760
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:40,121
oh dear,

761
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,200
you know the population,

762
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:41,890
whatever,

763
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,890
let's not go there and we thereby delay
the development of these therapies that

764
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:52,600
what we would be doing is
denying humanity of the future,

765
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,080
the option whether to use the therapy
based on the information that it had

766
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:57,250
available to us about,

767
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:57,820
you know,

768
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,360
available technology that will ever.

769
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
What if we develop these
things as fast as possible,

770
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,390
then humanity of the dads get the choice.

771
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Now I do not want to be someone who is
helping to condemn a cohort of the future

772
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,530
to an unnecessarily painful
and unnecessarily early death.

773
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,630
Just because I thought
I knew better than that.

774
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,990
Innovation and advancement seems to be
a fundamental part of human society and

775
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:23,741
civilization.

776
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:28,030
It just seems to be something that we
do no matter where you go to someone who

777
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:29,890
was always trying to
improve upon everything.

778
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,540
When you have medical science,

779
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:36,810
it only stands to reason that that too
would try to improve and advance and life

780
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,580
expectancy of,

781
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,121
of course,

782
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:40,931
the way you describe it,

783
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:44,110
the way you did with that being
the number one problem physically,

784
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,760
health wise in our world,

785
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,200
that's going to be a huge issue.

786
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,030
It's going to be a huge issue
that we're going to try to solve.

787
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:50,740
It's a fundamental part
of being a human being.

788
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,750
I very much like the way you said that.

789
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,800
I think that the right way
to explain the fallacy of,

790
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,910
um,

791
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,190
we could leave aging
alone because natural,

792
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,090
which some people say,

793
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,751
some people say,

794
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:02,200
well,

795
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,620
you know,

796
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,120
aging is not like a disease.

797
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,470
They have them through everything.

798
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,880
It's basically natural.

799
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:07,690
We shouldn't touch it.

800
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,650
And you're absolutely right.

801
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:09,490
You said it perfectly.

802
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,740
The way I would say is like,

803
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,430
it would be unnatural for us to,

804
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:15,900
to,

805
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,220
to,

806
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,140
to say,

807
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:17,711
oh dear,

808
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:18,491
let's leave it alone.

809
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:19,400
Even though it's horrible.

810
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:25,050
It was natural for the human for humanity
is to see what's natural and we don't

811
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:26,170
like,

812
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,003
and to fix it.

813
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:27,580
Well,

814
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,310
there's that existential angst that
people tend to wallow in and what's the

815
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:32,731
point,

816
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:34,410
what's it's all going to end some day,

817
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,640
what's the big deal?

818
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,810
And there's,

819
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,140
you know,

820
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,010
many groups have been many different
schools of thought when it comes to that.

821
00:32:40,011 --> 00:32:41,690
Some people just think that's nonsense,

822
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:42,441
enjoyed the moment,

823
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:43,131
live in the moment,

824
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:43,700
live,

825
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,481
live today.

826
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:45,314
Don't worry about the fee,

827
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,930
but there's a lot of people
who don't subscribe to that,

828
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,040
who really do get depressed when they
worried about their inevitable demise.

829
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,330
When you come across,

830
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,800
when you come around and say,

831
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,490
hey,

832
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,680
we are developing new
technologies that are gonna,

833
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:59,870
allow you to live within this lifetime.

834
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:02,510
We're going to meet the first person
who lives to be a thousand years.

835
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:02,721
They're like,

836
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:03,251
well great.

837
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:06,080
A thousand years of suffering
an existential angst.

838
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,160
They don't want it and that's where it's
a philosophical question really because

839
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:12,050
it's a matter of how do
you approach everyday,

840
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,650
how do you.

841
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,330
How do you approach this experience?

842
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,470
Do you look at this experience?

843
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:16,280
Like you said,

844
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,300
the moment you get laid,

845
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:17,511
go,

846
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:17,781
Geez,

847
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,970
I got to get her into bed because
I only have 60 years left,

848
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,040
or do you look at this experience saying,

849
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,660
while this is going on,

850
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,470
there are a million wonderful
things to enjoy about this life,

851
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,030
and on top of that,

852
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,210
it seems to me that as time goes on,

853
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:35,810
we're getting far better with this
whole civilization thing and one of the

854
00:33:35,811 --> 00:33:40,811
things that I think would benefit us more
than anything possible would be if we

855
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:45,080
could have people that could be alive
and healthy and live for 500 years.

856
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:50,081
I imagine that type of wisdom that they
could impart on the rest of us imagined

857
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:55,421
the life lessons that you would get
from a few centuries of mistakes and

858
00:33:56,031 --> 00:34:01,031
corrections and lessons and and and
information that you've absorbed.

859
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,670
We could transform society and culture,

860
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,440
World Society,

861
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:08,030
not National Society,

862
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,500
not local society,

863
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,110
but world society in a radical way.

864
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,260
Just with the wisdom that we
would all be able to share.

865
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,090
I think there was a lot of truth in that.

866
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,013
Absolutely.

867
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,700
I think,

868
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,490
you know,

869
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,340
maybe you could argue that
the fact that we have culture,

870
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,120
that we can write things down and fell
and maybe that doesn't matter so much

871
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:29,660
that individuals could be around
the white elephant for whatever.

872
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,990
But in practical terms,

873
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,711
it does matter.

874
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:38,711
I think it's got forgotten when the
people who came of with them a lot around

875
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:41,180
anymore and things got rediscovered.

876
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:41,590
Twentieth,

877
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,300
30th lights,

878
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,000
right through other rather ridiculous
the refill for a related point which I

879
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,370
think is worth bringing up at the,

880
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,260
uh,

881
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,740
uh,

882
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,170
the state with regard to the,

883
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,743
um,

884
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:53,910
uh,

885
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:54,350
the,

886
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,340
the value of,

887
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,320
of living a long time and the value of
all of the perceived value of living a

888
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:01,154
long time,

889
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,220
which is that at the moment,

890
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,530
the people who feel well
life not worth living,

891
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,090
flavor or whatever are actually the
same people who have a lot of trouble

892
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:16,880
understanding why the life
worth living for 50 years.

893
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,690
You know,

894
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,870
the people that spend their
time essentially living
their life in front of the

895
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:21,704
television,

896
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,910
they difficulty here is
simply a lack of education.

897
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:31,630
The fact that most people in today's
world do not have the training to be able

898
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:36,320
to understand how to get
the most out of life,

899
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,270
who do they do have good education,

900
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,640
good understanding of how
to get the most out of life.

901
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,010
We always have a massive backlog.

902
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,050
I've probably got a thousand
years of backlog already.

903
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,490
Other thing that I'd like to have done,

904
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:47,610
you know,

905
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,620
I've found that I liked
to have seen books.

906
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:50,330
I'd like to ride,

907
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,530
play for elect of God.

908
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,830
People don't like to have matt,

909
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,570
and by the time I'm through that,

910
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,870
I'm certain I'm going to have at
least another 10,000 years of backlog.

911
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,300
Right?

912
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,811
So,

913
00:35:59,811 --> 00:36:00,600
um,

914
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:00,830
so,

915
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,141
you know,

916
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:01,430
I mean,

917
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,670
all we need really is to
educate people better.

918
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,470
That's an interesting way to put it.

919
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:07,160
Educate.

920
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,490
Uh,

921
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:07,641
I,

922
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:08,120
I,

923
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,320
I tend to agree with you,

924
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,740
but I think that for a lot of people it
tends to be an issue of mental health.

925
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:15,490
Uh,

926
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,100
there's certain people that suffer from
depression or struggle with depression

927
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,900
and life itself becomes very
difficult for them to endure.

928
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:24,931
Okay.

929
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:25,641
I will stop you there.

930
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,000
Please come.

931
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,930
Because the thing I think we need to
understand the spectrum where there are

932
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:33,480
obviously some people who
are extremely depressed.

933
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:38,481
I have a friend actually in the UK who
is clinically depressed right now about

934
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,530
the problem of aging.

935
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,120
Her parents are in a bad way.

936
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,830
There is a plan and it's really going to.

937
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,703
And um,

938
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,041
you know,

939
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,510
that's an extreme example.

940
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,520
If we talk about the
just Malays know the end,

941
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:53,911
we,

942
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:54,170
that,

943
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:54,410
that,

944
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:54,910
that,

945
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,010
uh,

946
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:59,130
that I think is a much milder
version of the same thing.

947
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:02,910
Then I will accept what you
say that this is quite common,

948
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,320
but I would also say that it's
part of what I was talking about,

949
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,240
lack of training,

950
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:09,551
lack of,

951
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:09,870
lack of,

952
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,100
lack of exposure to the
opportunities that life has to offer.

953
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:18,900
A lack of understanding of how to
actually seek out those opportunities.

954
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,870
So I don't think it's such
a hard thing to eliminate

955
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,370
because I don't agree with you that
it's education because I know some very

956
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:28,880
educated people that struggle
with depression and I
think a lot of it has to do

957
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:30,200
with physical health that the,

958
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,330
the meat wagon that
you're carrying around,

959
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,150
that you're trudging through life with.

960
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,410
If it's burdensome,

961
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,880
if it's causing you issues,

962
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:38,930
if you don't take care of it,

963
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:39,741
if you eat poorly,

964
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:40,790
if you smoke cigarettes,

965
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,350
if you,

966
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:46,040
you tend to overindulge and alcohol
and it leaves your liver constantly

967
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,200
processing state and you're just a mess.

968
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:52,960
Like those people tend to have a
dollar experience and perhaps a,

969
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:54,290
a more burdensome experience.

970
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:54,711
Sure.

971
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:55,544
I just,

972
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,770
it's like the tail of the curve.

973
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,830
People that badly like that paypal.

974
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,800
And if we don't get the lodge end of
the population in the thick end of the

975
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:07,340
wedge,

976
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,530
then we're talking about a model,

977
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,370
the phenomenon.

978
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,350
But actually remind me
of another thing that,

979
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,340
um,

980
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:13,970
you know,

981
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:18,970
the is at the moment a very
strong tendency in society
say when exposed to the

982
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,920
ideas about the possibility of
bringing education to control.

983
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:26,510
And consequently living under
strong tendency to think,

984
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,260
oh my God,

985
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:27,750
the law,

986
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,750
the quality of that life will be put
advance because people have this sense in

987
00:38:33,831 --> 00:38:36,220
their head that quality and quantity,

988
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:38,260
I inherently opposed to each other.

989
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,360
The more quantity you have,

990
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,100
the left quality you're bound to have.

991
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,220
And of course that makes sense in today's
world in a way because by large to the

992
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:51,490
either a lot of things we like to do
that are bad for it will shorten their

993
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:52,001
lives by,

994
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:52,270
you know,

995
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,530
whether it's smoking or whatever.

996
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,253
Um,

997
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,860
but that's not going to be true in a
scenario in a world in which we have

998
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,650
therapists that can actually address
these various types of damage and repair

999
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:06,640
them in those situations.

1000
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,130
If you think they gotta be on
the same side of the fence,

1001
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,400
quality is going to be the
thing that confers quantity.

1002
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,840
So you imagine a world where
cigarettes are being consequential.

1003
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:19,580
You be smoking cigarettes just pop
in some sort of repair pill and Bam,

1004
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,350
no more Marlboro cancer.

1005
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,090
Well basically,

1006
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,451
yeah,

1007
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:25,240
I mean I don't like to point that out
too heavily because of course it's not

1008
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:26,140
true yet,

1009
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,460
so thank you on it.

1010
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:28,931
Well,

1011
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:29,231
right.

1012
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:29,681
That's right.

1013
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,740
I mean we don't know how long the therapy
they're going to take to come along

1014
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:38,070
and they bat in order to maintain your
chances of to maximize your chances of

1015
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:44,311
actually being around in time to benefit
from the therapy they actually live

1016
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:46,390
with healthy lifestyle.

1017
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:47,290
You can't at the moment.

1018
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:50,650
I mean I were talking earlier about
maybe you'll only get a year or two,

1019
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:52,100
but that might be the key area too,

1020
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,850
right?

1021
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,360
It might be the key year or two
that brings us to the next thousand.

1022
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,103
Exactly.

1023
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,670
You said that stem cells within a decade,

1024
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:05,671
you believe there's a large possibility
that it could cure Parkinson's,

1025
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,970
these other things that may
be 50 slash 50 and 25 years.

1026
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:11,050
Like what are they like what,

1027
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:12,760
what are the big ones
that you're excited about?

1028
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:13,990
Well,

1029
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,950
so most of what we work on,

1030
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:17,270
it sounds very first foundation.

1031
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:18,210
If they thought things,

1032
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,350
we actually do basically no stem
cell therapy work and that family,

1033
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,420
because so many other people are doing
and it's understood as a very plausible

1034
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:31,630
and very exciting approach to treating
a number of different conditions,

1035
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,200
not restricted,

1036
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:36,260
of course do age related ones and um,

1037
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,681
you know,

1038
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:40,370
it would be a poor use
of our limited funds to,

1039
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:40,870
to,

1040
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,650
to add a drop into that bucket,

1041
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,970
um,

1042
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:48,140
but most of the other things that we
felt needed to be done have neglected.

1043
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:48,951
So,

1044
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:49,221
um,

1045
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:50,840
let me think where I would even start.

1046
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,501
Well,

1047
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:51,711
okay.

1048
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:55,070
One great example that we've
been working on is not disease.

1049
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,630
Atherosclerosis is of course the
number one killer in the western world.

1050
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,620
It's,

1051
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,430
um,

1052
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:06,430
it's the code of honor attacks and strokes
and it's related because it's caused

1053
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,070
by the lifelong accumulation
of a particular type of damage.

1054
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,850
And this guy to talk of damage is the
accumulation of waste products in the

1055
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:14,684
artery wall.

1056
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,920
The wife that mattered to him
the most is oxidized cholesterol.

1057
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,710
Cholesterol itself is not a bad molecule.

1058
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,060
People got this wrong a lot,

1059
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,881
but glass right?

1060
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:24,740
The vital molecule,

1061
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:26,900
you don't want to remove your cholesterol,

1062
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:32,290
you do want to have a
remove the contamination
cholesterol that accumulates a

1063
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,400
low significant levels in the body
oxidized restaurant in particular.

1064
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,600
That is what poisons white blood cells
that are in the artery wall and makes

1065
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:44,090
them into what are called foam cells,

1066
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:47,740
which are the first step in the
creation of an atherosclerotic plaque.

1067
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,210
And we'd like to stop that happening
and we'd like to prevent atherosclerosis

1068
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,044
for variety.

1069
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,320
So the way we've done that is we've
identified bacteria in the soil actually

1070
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,830
that had Jane's and enzymes that are,

1071
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,850
that allow them to break down oxidized
cholesterol and we've identified these

1072
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:15,140
bacteria and the drains and enzymes and
we've introduced those genes into human

1073
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:16,970
fell and fell culture.

1074
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,410
And it works.

1075
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,890
We have shown that these cells
that have a engineered gene,

1076
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,960
a much more protected,

1077
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,670
that much more robust in the presence of
a certain amount of this toxic oxidized

1078
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,850
cholesterol than health data.

1079
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,890
And of course we're moving
forward to take that to,

1080
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:34,724
um,

1081
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,520
to,

1082
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:35,781
uh,

1083
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:38,950
other types of style into mice
before we go into clinical trial.

1084
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,050
That's the kind of thing that
we're doing that earlier stage,

1085
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:43,580
so it might take a bit longer.

1086
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,350
This oxidized cholesterol.

1087
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:47,300
Can this be eliminated with diet?

1088
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,261
Absolutely.

1089
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:51,650
You know the fundamental
problem is that these molecules,

1090
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,660
these oxidized cholesterol species,

1091
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,360
they get into a white blood cells.

1092
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,290
They get into a part of
the cell called the lifers.

1093
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,140
They poisoned the cell,

1094
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:01,500
they inactivate the license,

1095
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,540
and that means that the white blood cells
can no longer do what they used to be

1096
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,110
able to do it.

1097
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,240
They can no longer process
normal cholesterol.

1098
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:08,961
No,

1099
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,070
you can't do anything to the data.

1100
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:15,071
That stuff is just there because the
cells don't have any machinery to get rid

1101
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:15,710
of it,

1102
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,050
but are they a product of what we eat,

1103
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,071
like product,

1104
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:20,480
but it actually dental product,

1105
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:23,930
so they happen just because
the bound to happen,

1106
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,360
but cholesterol comes from animal protein.

1107
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:31,130
Is that a constant kind of we bring
in cholesterol in our diet and we also

1108
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:35,270
synthesize our own cholesterol and
the liver and that's how it should be.

1109
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,400
That cholesterol is doing a good job.

1110
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,200
The problem is that oxidation
is a chemical reaction
that is going to happen in

1111
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:42,561
the body,

1112
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:43,670
whether you like it or not.

1113
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,280
The fact is we are aerobic organisms.

1114
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:47,690
We need to breathe,

1115
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,220
we need to,

1116
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,990
we need to inhale oxygen
in order to keep going.

1117
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,300
And breathing is really bad for you.

1118
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,920
Breathing is bad for you.

1119
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,320
Breathing is why we get free radicals,

1120
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:58,390
but it's a bit nonnegotiable.

1121
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,323
This is the thing.

1122
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,210
So we've got to intervene in this process.

1123
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:07,510
One step down the chain of events to get
rid of the toxic products of breathing

1124
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:09,740
rather than to get rid
of breathing itself.

1125
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,900
Breathing is bad for you.

1126
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,110
That's a pretty straightforward statement.

1127
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,050
And it's unequivocal.

1128
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:15,950
Wow.

1129
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:16,250
Um,

1130
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,180
so when,

1131
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:19,910
when they use like hyperbaric chambers,

1132
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:22,430
oxygen rich environments
to enhance healing,

1133
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,730
is that extra band for you necessarily?

1134
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,440
So of course breathing is also good for
you if you don't breathe then yet at

1135
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:30,100
least grade,

1136
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,760
right?

1137
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,930
So it's a trade off.

1138
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,650
There are some aspects of
branding than about for you.

1139
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,080
And we need to fix that aspect.

1140
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,320
And those aspects have
zero to do with diet.

1141
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,131
So this,

1142
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:41,964
this,

1143
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:42,440
well,

1144
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,660
I wouldn't type of cholesterol,

1145
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,640
so I feel really low on,

1146
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:47,211
for example,

1147
00:44:47,211 --> 00:44:48,710
vitamin C or vitamin A,

1148
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:53,950
then you are depleting your own body's
ability to limit the toxicity of

1149
00:44:56,331 --> 00:45:01,331
breathing and therefore the breathing
will be even more bad food that otherwise

1150
00:45:01,851 --> 00:45:02,360
would be.

1151
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,100
So oxidants are crucial if
you're going to bother breathing

1152
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,360
to a point.

1153
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,830
But it turns out that because breathing
has been around a long time and

1154
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:11,490
breathing,

1155
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,590
breathing was invented
about 2 billion years ago.

1156
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,060
Um,

1157
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,130
evolution has done what
evolution tends to do.

1158
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,600
It made the best of a bad job.

1159
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,000
And therefore at this point,

1160
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,910
some of the toxic byproducts
of breathing free radical,

1161
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,573
uh,

1162
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,220
actually not just bad
molecules that are also good,

1163
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:31,920
they used by the body
as signaling molecules.

1164
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,050
So if we were to have a magic wand that
we could wave and just get rid of all

1165
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:38,280
the free radicals in the body,

1166
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,540
that will be extremely bad.

1167
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,420
You'd die at one.

1168
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,090
What we have,

1169
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,933
therefore,

1170
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,870
a rather interesting
balance that the body techs,

1171
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,480
if you have too few antioxidants,

1172
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,650
then that's bad news.

1173
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,470
But if you have an
abundance of antioxidants,

1174
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:54,780
if you take megadoses of
vitamin C or vitamin here,

1175
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:55,620
for example,

1176
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,930
doesn't really do much written.

1177
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:02,010
It doesn't is because the body wants a
certain amount of free radicals around so

1178
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:04,730
it dials down the inherent,

1179
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:09,570
the inbuilt antioxidant Mechan machinery
and you end up basically where you

1180
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:10,404
started.

1181
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,970
So this bacteria that you're
introducing to skin culture,

1182
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:19,000
getting the bacteria themselves
were introducing that one,

1183
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:19,820
Jane from the back.

1184
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,700
Terry one gene from an eminent,

1185
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,500
integrating it into language,

1186
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,000
artery tissue.

1187
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,560
We are in cultures.

1188
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:27,940
I thought.

1189
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,773
Yes.

1190
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,260
How far away do you believe you are to
implementing this in an actual human

1191
00:46:33,261 --> 00:46:34,010
being

1192
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:34,843
or?

1193
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,660
Well,

1194
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,580
clinical trials I think could be.

1195
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,960
Could be 10 years away.

1196
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,310
I think we were probably talking,

1197
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,050
we'll probably talking a.

1198
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:46,570
This is an intermediate one way might.

1199
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:51,350
I would expect that we've got a 50 slash
50 chance of bringing this to the point

1200
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,140
of being an approved therapy
within maybe 15 years.

1201
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:54,761
Now.

1202
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:56,020
Me As a lay person,

1203
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,940
standing on the outside
looking at all this stuff,

1204
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:59,320
I'm always very optimistic.

1205
00:46:59,321 --> 00:46:59,711
Oh yeah,

1206
00:46:59,711 --> 00:47:00,461
this is going to be great.

1207
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:01,241
Within my lifetime,

1208
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:04,090
to see some huge changes
talking to you though,

1209
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,100
it's not that I get less optimistic,

1210
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:11,101
but I get more aware of the actual
landscape itself and I started realizing,

1211
00:47:11,351 --> 00:47:11,531
well,

1212
00:47:11,531 --> 00:47:16,210
this this thing that we have that
we're carrying around this body has an

1213
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:21,810
indescribable number of operations that
are going on simultaneously and there's.

1214
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:29,450
There's there's reactions and counter
reactions and all of these are completely

1215
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:30,100
totally

1216
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,641
understood,

1217
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:31,310
so when you're.

1218
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:36,100
You're talking about anti aging or
life extension or any of these things,

1219
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,410
you're talking about just a stupendous
number of different processes that are

1220
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:45,820
going on in the body that we're going to
have to figure out and that is going to

1221
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,050
take a very,

1222
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:51,190
very long time and not one person is
going to ever understand all of the

1223
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:52,024
process.

1224
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:57,070
Perfectly articulated why people who
started the biology of aging Hud,

1225
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:02,650
but about the mid 1980 to go to the point
of absolute rejection of the idea that

1226
00:48:04,611 --> 00:48:08,390
what they even were working on
was doing anything about aging.

1227
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,070
Basically.

1228
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,090
It had become very frowned upon even
to talk about intervention and a ground

1229
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,721
application,

1230
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:15,560
for example.

1231
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,551
Essentially,

1232
00:48:16,551 --> 00:48:17,900
because everyone understood,

1233
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,501
oh my God,

1234
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:18,861
the buddy,

1235
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:19,760
it's a complicated.

1236
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:21,320
We understand it so poorly.

1237
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,940
It's never gonna happen,

1238
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,940
so please.

1239
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,490
So here's the thing that
changed for in two steps.

1240
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:28,940
First of all,

1241
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,520
establish a workout and then the debt,

1242
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:31,354
the debt,

1243
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,020
the first thing that happened late 19,

1244
00:48:33,021 --> 00:48:33,650
88,

1245
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:33,981
19,

1246
00:48:33,981 --> 00:48:38,981
98 with people started to discover simple
ways to extend the longevity of some

1247
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,420
certain laboratory organism,

1248
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:45,310
initially worms and eventually my wife.

1249
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,740
This was enormously exciting.

1250
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:50,240
Those discoveries and
they fall out from them,

1251
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:53,960
still dominate the
failed in people's eyes.

1252
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,010
Uh,

1253
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:59,750
the problem is it doesn't work for long
lived organisms essentially because it's

1254
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:04,751
all about the ability of the organism
to respond to famine and short lived

1255
00:49:06,141 --> 00:49:09,970
organisms need to be able to
respond more dramatically to Pharma.

1256
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:11,090
And then long lived Wednesday.

1257
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,490
So I'll go into more
detail if you really well,

1258
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:14,510
but that's the basics of it.

1259
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:19,910
The one that did work was when I came
along 15 years ago and talked about damage

1260
00:49:19,911 --> 00:49:20,744
repair.

1261
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:23,900
Here's the reason why damage
repair is so important.

1262
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,160
It sidesteps a.

1263
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:29,270
all of that complexity that you were
talking about and all of our ignorance

1264
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:34,271
about that complexity was it sidestep
it because the damage that the body does

1265
00:49:35,121 --> 00:49:40,121
to itself throughout life as a side
effect of its normal operation is only

1266
00:49:41,391 --> 00:49:43,700
harmful late in life.

1267
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:48,890
The body is set up to tolerate a certain
amount of that damage and the problem

1268
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,400
only starts when the amount of damage
exceeds the amount that I set up to

1269
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,283
tolerate.

1270
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,090
So that means that until that point,

1271
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:01,520
the damage is not participating in this
massively complex network of processes

1272
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:02,720
that we call metabolism.

1273
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,940
It's just accumulating as a,

1274
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,460
uh,

1275
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,080
an inert byproduct.

1276
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:12,620
It's only by mass action after it becomes
a enormously abundant in late life

1277
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:14,270
that it becomes part of metabolism,

1278
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:17,030
a gap that's hugely important.

1279
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,550
It means that if we go
in and target the damage,

1280
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,390
one who's not participating in metabolism,

1281
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:28,810
we have a much better chance of doing so
appreciable side of that than we would

1282
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,980
if we were going in and trying
to manipulate metabolism itself.

1283
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,330
Which abl within itself,

1284
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:35,580
yeah,

1285
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,650
and crazy insane network of Spaghetti
code that not got any comments,

1286
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,580
so to speak.

1287
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,240
And you try to do anything to
it to stop it doing the thing.

1288
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,130
You don't want it to do
the creation of damage.

1289
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,030
You're going to have unintended
consequences that do more harm than good,

1290
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,330
but if you don't do that,

1291
00:50:53,331 --> 00:50:58,331
if you instead of the damage itself was
is outside of that network of metabolism

1292
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,680
than he'd done had that
problem in the same way.

1293
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:05,760
Is there any focus on
concentrating on the potential of.

1294
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:11,210
You were saying that the body has a
very good ability to deal with all this

1295
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:15,750
damage at a young age and as you get
older it becomes less and less able to

1296
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:19,050
blend the real solution,

1297
00:51:19,051 --> 00:51:20,670
be catching it early.

1298
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,930
Finding people that are very young and
implementing these strategies on them.

1299
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:30,250
Not really because the only reason why
an older person who's less able to cope

1300
00:51:30,471 --> 00:51:31,304
with the it,

1301
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:34,910
it's because the older person
has more damage occurring.

1302
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,340
Moreover around why is that?

1303
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:40,540
Because it had longer to
accumulate and me going away,

1304
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,160
so young person doesn't have much damage.

1305
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,570
It doesn't really make sense
for someone in their twenties.

1306
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,423
Even 30,

1307
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,750
let's look for 20,

1308
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:48,021
30,

1309
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,720
40 years from now when they
therapies actually exist,

1310
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,670
would it make sense for a 20 year
old to actually a of the therapist?

1311
00:51:55,671 --> 00:52:00,671
Probably not because that's going to be
at least another 20 or 30 years before

1312
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:05,750
they're going to suffer any actual
serious functional decline as a result of

1313
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:09,160
this damage and during
that time the therapy,

1314
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:14,161
they're going to get better by more
convenient and more comprehensive and

1315
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,793
thorough.

1316
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:19,010
The tradeoff is to wait for
the therapist to be improved.

1317
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:19,890
Well,

1318
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,020
that's not necessarily
what I was getting at.

1319
00:52:22,021 --> 00:52:22,854
What I was getting at.

1320
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:26,310
You were saying that over time that
damage accumulates to the point where your

1321
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:28,260
body can no longer process
the damage anymore.

1322
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,730
What would it be?

1323
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,380
More advantageous to catch it before
it accumulates to deal with the issues

1324
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:35,790
before they become substantial?

1325
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,291
Well,

1326
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:37,610
but what fence is,

1327
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:38,720
we're going in and saying,

1328
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:40,700
let's not take 20 year old,

1329
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,430
but yes,

1330
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,620
like 40 or 50 year old,

1331
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,640
eight year old,

1332
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,331
not 80 year olds.

1333
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:48,980
You're fucked if you're 80 already
fucked you just for now that it's harder.

1334
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,780
Let me go into that a
little bit more data.

1335
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,090
If you take someone who's let's say 50,

1336
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,430
that all the natives defense therapy,

1337
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:59,780
the damage repair therapy that reduce
their level of damage to a white world

1338
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:01,340
back when they were 20 or 30 years ago,

1339
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,290
and of course bundling periodically.

1340
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,430
No,

1341
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:08,990
if the damage has already got the point
where it caused disease and disability

1342
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,824
to image.

1343
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:11,270
Let's say someone who's typically it,

1344
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,560
they've gone downhill quite a lot.

1345
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,430
Then these therapies are
still going to be very useful,

1346
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:18,500
but they're going to be useful
in a slightly different way.

1347
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,740
They're going to be useful when used in
combination with traditional geriatric

1348
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,560
therapy.

1349
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,430
The kind that currently we have today.

1350
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,530
Remember what I said earlier,

1351
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:32,220
that the geriatric therapies today
don't work and they never will work.

1352
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,520
Basically because they're
attacking the symptoms.

1353
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:40,170
They are kind of laboring
under the apprehension that
the diseases of old age or

1354
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:41,340
like infections.

1355
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,150
Well that means is that basically
they hacking away at something that is

1356
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:50,151
becoming harder and harder to hack away
at because it's cause it namely the

1357
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:52,890
damage from me throughout life.

1358
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,140
It's continuing to accumulate,

1359
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,450
so if you think about what that means,

1360
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,500
if we were able to go in and
actually repair the damage,

1361
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,970
then we would be in,

1362
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,420
if you like,

1363
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,180
potentiating the geriatric therapists,

1364
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:11,100
we will allow the geriatric therapist
to actually work and it may end up being

1365
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:12,150
that we need to do that,

1366
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,400
that if someone's in there,

1367
00:54:13,401 --> 00:54:17,430
it was going downhill and we only fix
the damage that got them that way.

1368
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,660
That won't be enough because the diseases,

1369
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,431
the pathology is,

1370
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:22,440
we'll have a lot of
their own at that point.

1371
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,110
We made to go in at two
levels at the same time.

1372
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,350
What are these geriatric
therapists that I've just been,

1373
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,251
I've just been like,

1374
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:29,830
you know,

1375
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:30,663
um,

1376
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,553
uh,

1377
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:34,483
uh,

1378
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,620
injecting dopamine for
Parkinson's disease for example.

1379
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:38,431
Basically,

1380
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:38,850
you know,

1381
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:39,930
short term benefit,

1382
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,520
mild benefit,

1383
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,080
a reason.

1384
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:44,820
It's basically the
problem is getting worse.

1385
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:46,260
The cell to continuing to die,

1386
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:47,610
you're going to need more and more drug.

1387
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,580
Many become more and more resistant to,

1388
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:49,981
for me,

1389
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:54,780
it's being supplied in the wrong schedule
anywhere at the wrong times because

1390
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:57,810
you can own it because just took
it to the nature of delivery.

1391
00:54:57,811 --> 00:54:59,430
You can only deliver it in a Boliss,

1392
00:54:59,710 --> 00:54:59,980
uh,

1393
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,430
you know,

1394
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:05,430
these things are all ways in which
such therapies cannot be perfect.

1395
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:10,020
Whereas if we were to put the cells
back to repair the originating damage,

1396
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:15,380
then any other things downstream that
had gone wrong in the rest of the brain

1397
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,110
would be treatable by other therapies,

1398
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:22,260
by more traditional therapies
in a much more effective way.

1399
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,650
And they can now one of their methods
or you're looking into for repairing

1400
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:28,140
damage other than
introducing this bacteria to.

1401
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:28,891
Okay.

1402
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:29,380
So that's.

1403
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,270
So that's the second one
I mentioned the first run,

1404
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,750
but wherever was just stem cell therapy,

1405
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,450
right?

1406
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:33,900
Uh,

1407
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,710
let's take another one.

1408
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,990
Let's take um,

1409
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,853
the immune system.

1410
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:42,510
So the immune system is a classic example
of the problem of what I call death

1411
00:55:42,511 --> 00:55:43,770
resistant cells.

1412
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,940
That means cells with that rather than
having too few of them in Parkinson's

1413
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:48,750
disease,

1414
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,130
you have too many of them.

1415
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,750
And in particularly,

1416
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,990
you have too many because they're
not dying when they're supposed to.

1417
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,020
People don't often think in terms of the
idea that felt that there could be any

1418
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:00,330
cells that should die,

1419
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,390
but the immune system is a great
example of that where when you get an

1420
00:56:04,391 --> 00:56:05,224
infection,

1421
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,570
finances I have now,

1422
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,404
in fact,

1423
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:13,100
you have a very small population of white
blood cells that divide like crazy to

1424
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:16,970
get to a big enough population to
attack and eliminate the infection.

1425
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,360
After that happened,

1426
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:23,660
that almost all of them die again to
leave written basically for a completely

1427
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:25,870
different subset to divide like crazy.

1428
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,310
Next time you get a different infection.

1429
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,740
Turns out that in old age,

1430
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,580
that whole cycle of division and death,

1431
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,523
uh,

1432
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:40,230
basically goes wrong and you end up with
a lot of cells that divide like crazy

1433
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:41,740
to attack an infection.

1434
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,850
Then when the things got away,

1435
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:44,020
they don't die again.

1436
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:47,950
And they're getting in
the way they inhibited the
proliferation of other cells.

1437
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,720
So what do we want to do about that?

1438
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,530
Well,

1439
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,480
there are various options out there,

1440
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:55,570
but we think that we need to
go for the juggler of this.

1441
00:56:55,571 --> 00:57:00,250
We need to do something that's very
decisive and so we're looking at a method

1442
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,170
that's called suicide gene therapy.

1443
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,930
Well now that sounds pretty crazy,

1444
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:05,320
doesn't it?

1445
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,320
But it turns out that it's actually
much less crazy than the name implies.

1446
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,490
So it's like gene therapy has been
a routine technique in the lab,

1447
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:16,960
a Doosan mice,

1448
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:17,561
for example,

1449
00:57:17,561 --> 00:57:18,520
for quite a long time.

1450
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:23,610
Essentially what it is is you introduce
a gene into cells that produce the toxic

1451
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:26,830
protein when the protein is produced,

1452
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:27,664
the cell dies,

1453
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:32,730
but you arrange this so that the protein
is only produced when the cell gets

1454
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:35,920
into a particular state
that you don't want to do.

1455
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,813
At that point,

1456
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:40,420
I'm relatively routine idea.

1457
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,100
The,

1458
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,170
what we would like to do is
to make it work for humans.

1459
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,140
And the problem there is
you've got to make it safe.

1460
00:57:47,141 --> 00:57:47,974
Of course.

1461
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:48,431
Now,

1462
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:53,350
gene therapy in general is a very tricky
concept to make safe and that it some

1463
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:55,570
ups and downs over the
past 20 years at least.

1464
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,760
But the um,

1465
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:58,740
got into service,

1466
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,850
I didn't therapy had
additional difficulties.

1467
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:06,060
You really don't want this go this Jane
talks that where's the toxic protein?

1468
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,830
Just killing cells randomly
when it shouldn't be.

1469
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:11,770
So we're working on new,

1470
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:16,000
more elaborate ways to put multiple
lines of defense against that problem.

1471
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:22,450
How many different people do you guys
employ that you have working on all these

1472
00:58:22,451 --> 00:58:23,770
various methods?

1473
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:24,401
Kind of.

1474
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:27,910
Depends on what you mean by employed
because we have some people that way fund

1475
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,230
through university labs,

1476
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:33,400
but taking the broader definition of
everyone who relied on us for that salary,

1477
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:34,870
I think throughout that at this point.

1478
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,580
And do you,

1479
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:40,450
do you personally oversee all these
various projects or do you other the chief

1480
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:41,284
science officer?

1481
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,880
I oversee the project and the fence of.

1482
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,793
Yes,

1483
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,450
I would say the decision making
process of prioritizing projects,

1484
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:50,890
deciding which new projects to do,

1485
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:55,891
deciding how about I was
going to regularly with the
professors and other lab

1486
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:00,610
heads that are responsible
for the project.

1487
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:00,971
So yeah,

1488
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:02,290
that's what I did in addition to,

1489
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:07,010
of course also bang the chief
outreach reserve and the chief wizard.

1490
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,113
I mean,

1491
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,820
not mean everyone notices you,

1492
00:59:10,821 --> 00:59:12,210
you're talking about life extension.

1493
00:59:12,211 --> 00:59:13,730
Then you have a sorceress beard.

1494
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,940
This is by that day I
told my last float by.

1495
00:59:16,941 --> 00:59:17,121
Well,

1496
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:18,370
I feel bad for the ethic.

1497
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,420
That's right.

1498
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:24,170
Then he asked the my wife campaigns
after we met for a long time.

1499
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:28,200
We met 25 years ago now and it took her
five years to persuade me to grow there,

1500
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,450
but eventually I tried to give it a go
and I was as surprised as anybody when it

1501
00:59:32,451 --> 00:59:33,284
came out like this.

1502
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:36,650
That's interesting because that's kind
of your calling card I suppose it has

1503
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:36,921
become.

1504
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:37,754
So

1505
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:39,830
are you satisfied by this research?

1506
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,810
Is this is a stimulating to you?

1507
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,570
Is this something that you
truly enjoying this process?

1508
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:45,151
Well,

1509
00:59:45,151 --> 00:59:47,010
I always have an ambivalence.

1510
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:48,570
On the one hand,

1511
00:59:48,571 --> 00:59:48,961
yes,

1512
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:52,920
I'm extremely gratified that it's going
so well from a personal perspective of

1513
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:55,650
if I'm proud that I've been able
to make a significant difference,

1514
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,310
but at the same time all of that,

1515
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:02,311
it always enormously to by the knowledge
that the still a lot of people dying

1516
01:00:03,301 --> 01:00:04,050
out that,

1517
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:05,850
that this is not going to fly.

1518
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,430
So I talked about our budget before,

1519
01:00:08,431 --> 01:00:09,130
I felt like,

1520
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:09,410
you know,

1521
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,660
we have about $5 million
a year that we spend.

1522
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:17,370
That's an incredibly small amount for
the thing that producers most of the

1523
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:18,270
world's suffering.

1524
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,253
Right?

1525
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:19,920
Wow.

1526
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,150
What the Hell's going on there?

1527
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:26,070
And that's why I spend more of my time
trying to raise money than I do actually

1528
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:29,750
overseeing the thought
I have to the dilemma.

1529
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:30,090
Right.

1530
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:30,841
Well that's right.

1531
01:00:30,841 --> 01:00:34,470
I mean even if it was a third
one more zero to that budget,

1532
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:38,940
if we had like $50,000,000 or
$100,000,000,000 a year spend,

1533
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,000
we'd probably be going three times faster,

1534
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:47,180
three times faster and that would
save the most insane number of lie.

1535
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:50,220
That's the thing that really gets
me out of bed in the morning.

1536
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:53,380
Do you have the ear of politicians?

1537
01:00:53,381 --> 01:00:54,760
Do you have the ear of,

1538
01:00:54,761 --> 01:00:59,470
of of people that are in charge of the
universities that will listen to you and

1539
01:00:59,471 --> 01:01:01,300
perhaps allocate more money your way.

1540
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:05,050
It's a very complicated network of
conversations that needs to happen.

1541
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:07,540
The difficulty with politicians,

1542
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:10,750
of course there's the politicians
ultimately have one single God I live,

1543
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:15,751
which is to get reelected as the public
policy tends to follow public opinion

1544
01:01:16,511 --> 01:01:17,650
rather than leading edge.

1545
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:22,980
So it's more important to me to appeal
to public opinion and try to educate

1546
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,850
people and right at the quality of debate,

1547
01:01:24,851 --> 01:01:27,760
that's why they said that interviews
like this apart from anything else.

1548
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:28,930
Um,

1549
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,160
then of course there's other people,

1550
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:30,341
you know,

1551
01:01:30,341 --> 01:01:32,320
this wealthy individuals trying to,

1552
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:32,540
you know,

1553
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:33,020
I try to,

1554
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,120
I try to meet as many of those.

1555
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:36,850
I can generally get them to
understand what's going on.

1556
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,890
The fact that we're a five,

1557
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:39,011
zero,

1558
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:39,341
one c,

1559
01:01:39,341 --> 01:01:41,440
three public charity obviously does help.

1560
01:01:41,441 --> 01:01:44,320
It means that anyone can give us
money in a tax efficient manner,

1561
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:45,270
but no,

1562
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,350
we've just got to get more
of that money in the door.

1563
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,180
Do you have kickstarter?

1564
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:50,080
Go Fund me.

1565
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,040
Any of those accounts?

1566
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:54,410
We have done a certain
amount of crowd funding,

1567
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,910
but ultimately must,

1568
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:56,151
well,

1569
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:58,750
pretty much all of the crowd funding a,

1570
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:03,940
that can be taken a really difficult to
reconcile with what we do essentially.

1571
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,740
Because if you're looking
for small amounts,

1572
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:07,341
fine,

1573
01:02:07,341 --> 01:02:09,940
but we're looking for relatively large
amount of United States seven digit,

1574
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:10,790
um,

1575
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,590
project for those things.

1576
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:17,030
It's really got to appeal
to the imagination what
the specific achievement is

1577
01:02:17,031 --> 01:02:18,250
going to be a,

1578
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:19,183
with early stage.

1579
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,550
It's really hard to explain that in
terms that really gripped paypal.

1580
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,410
So it's not really worked
all that well for us.

1581
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,690
What we were describing before that
pharmaceutical companies sort of hedging

1582
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:29,051
their bets,

1583
01:02:29,051 --> 01:02:31,480
waiting on the sidelines for
something to be worth betting on.

1584
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:33,311
Boy,

1585
01:02:33,311 --> 01:02:34,840
I'd like to change that if we can,

1586
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:39,760
whatever impact we can have on it and
this podcast gets millions and millions of

1587
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,580
downloads and I'm sure we'll
have some effect on it,

1588
01:02:42,581 --> 01:02:43,720
but I would like to,

1589
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:44,440
you know,

1590
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,221
whatever you need,

1591
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:49,290
do you need things tweeted for
you and posted on the bottom.

1592
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,570
This is fascinating stuff to me.

1593
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,870
I'm obviously because I have
zero research background,

1594
01:02:55,871 --> 01:02:57,310
no medical science background.

1595
01:02:57,311 --> 01:03:00,370
So to me it's like when I get a
chance to talk to someone like you,

1596
01:03:00,371 --> 01:03:05,371
it's like a window into this world that
I only a ordinarily get through articles

1597
01:03:06,251 --> 01:03:07,540
and papers.

1598
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:08,621
I think it's,

1599
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:09,454
um,

1600
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:09,970
it's,

1601
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,440
it's massively important.

1602
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:12,283
It's also,

1603
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,280
as I discussed before,

1604
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:15,911
as I said before,

1605
01:03:15,911 --> 01:03:18,010
I think it's a fundamental
part of human nature.

1606
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,300
We want to improve everything
and your health and your,

1607
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:26,301
your ability to enjoy this time is
huge and if you could extend that,

1608
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:27,590
you,

1609
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:29,560
you have the potential
to be a better person.

1610
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:31,720
I think I'm a better person
now than I was 10 years ago.

1611
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,840
I think I'd be even better if I
could get another 100 and you know,

1612
01:03:34,841 --> 01:03:39,280
I think we could do some real change
and I think a lot of that real change

1613
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:40,110
could,

1614
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:40,501
you know,

1615
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:41,350
there's that issue.

1616
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:44,710
Like why worry about this are fundamental
problems are the toxification of the

1617
01:03:44,711 --> 01:03:45,380
environment,

1618
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:45,531
blah,

1619
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:45,940
blah.

1620
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:50,940
I think we could put more emphasis
on that if we could have some of the

1621
01:03:51,611 --> 01:03:53,490
brilliant people that we
have a live today live longer

1622
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:56,520
back in 2006.

1623
01:03:56,521 --> 01:03:57,450
When I spoke at Ted,

1624
01:03:57,451 --> 01:03:59,760
actually I made that whole comfort,

1625
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:01,080
the centerpiece of my talk.

1626
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:04,120
I said basically zero visionaries.

1627
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,220
You like aiming high.

1628
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:09,530
This could be the
critical feature of this.

1629
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:15,140
Even independently of the in inherent
humanitarian value of defeating aging,

1630
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,980
aging is the thing that has ground up
doubt over the history of civilization,

1631
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:27,060
the thing that has made us know
that we are at the mercy of nature.

1632
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,150
If we can bring that truly under control,

1633
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,010
then this will empower us.

1634
01:04:32,011 --> 01:04:37,011
It will make us feel really much more
confident that we can address the other

1635
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:38,130
really hard problems,

1636
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:39,480
whether it's climate change,

1637
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:39,720
you know,

1638
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,470
world peace,

1639
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:41,490
whatever it might be.

1640
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,710
The guys who run the global
20 slash 45 initiative,

1641
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:45,991
the,

1642
01:04:45,991 --> 01:04:46,160
uh,

1643
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,030
the idea that,

1644
01:04:47,031 --> 01:04:47,540
uh,

1645
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:51,050
there'll be some sort of
technological answer to this question.

1646
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:55,220
Are they supportive of the biological
ideas as well as their cooperation between

1647
01:04:55,221 --> 01:04:55,880
these two groups?

1648
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,713
Sure,

1649
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:57,520
yeah.

1650
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:02,520
There's always a spectrum of opinion with
regard to desirability and feasibility

1651
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:04,564
of the things.

1652
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,770
But absolutely,

1653
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:06,604
you know,

1654
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,830
everyone knows that
we're on the same side.

1655
01:05:08,831 --> 01:05:10,330
We're not in favor of getting fit.

1656
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:12,830
You are truly a mad scientist.

1657
01:05:12,831 --> 01:05:14,800
I know you're tired and I know you,

1658
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:18,220
you're way past your bedtime
when it comes to the UK.

1659
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:22,360
So I really appreciate you being
here and for for folks at home,

1660
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,400
what's the best way to contact you?

1661
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:26,260
What's the best way to send money?

1662
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,970
What's the best way to reach out?

1663
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,940
But that's why I have to go to sense.org.

1664
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,210
That's [inaudible]

1665
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:36,830
dot org.

1666
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,030
Just go there.

1667
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,110
It had all the information
about what we do,

1668
01:05:40,111 --> 01:05:42,410
about what we'd like to do
about what we have done.

1669
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:46,940
It got all the information you could
imagine about why this is important.

1670
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:52,140
It's got a nice way to contact us with
any method you'd like and of course with

1671
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,020
a nice big friendly donate button.

1672
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,260

1677

please don't hesitate to ask.

1678
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:06,820
I'd be more than happy to help.

1679
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:07,451
Well,

1680
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:08,440
you're extremely conscious.

1681
01:06:08,441 --> 01:06:09,620
I thank you for having me on the show.

1682
01:06:09,621 --> 01:06:12,850

can do to help the real band,

1684
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:17,080
the more live you will.

1685
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:17,914
Five.

1686
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:18,310
Wow.

1687
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,143
I hope you're right.

1688
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:19,630
You're.

1689
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,880
You're really impressive individual.

1690
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:22,391
I really,

1691
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:23,680
really appreciate you taking your time.

1692
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:24,640
Aubrey de grey.

you look at it a little bit?

1696
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,363
Check it out.

1697
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:31,780
Don't send them anything rude.

1698
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,063
Fucking freaks.

1699
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:33,400
Alright.

1700
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:33,971
Thank you very much,

1701
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:34,151
brother.

1702
01:06:34,151 --> 01:06:34,421
I really,

1703
01:06:34,421 --> 01:06:35,200
really appreciate it.

1704
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:35,560
I really.

1705
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,020
Great Ladies,

1706
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:36,853
gentlemen.

1707
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:40,963
Oh,

1708
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:42,340
that was fun.
