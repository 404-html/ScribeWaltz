1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,760
Three two,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,660
one.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,350
Boom.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,183
Eve Edwards.

5
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,290
Welcome to the show.

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,600
Thanks for having me man.

7
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,780
Finally got you in here,

8
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:10,111
man.

9
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,550
We've talked about this a bunch of times,

10
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:14,480
but this is the perfect time because a,

11
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,450
we're doing a fight.

12
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,270
Companion is a very first one
we've ever done for glory,

13
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:19,170
kickboxing,

14
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,003
Joe Schilling,

15
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,961
world championship.

16
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:23,790
Kickboxer himself is on his way.

17
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,361
He's over here.

18
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,380
He fucking hates glory.

19
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:27,000
They talk shit about him after he left,

20
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,663
but uh,

21
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,020
I'm sure it will be good.

22
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,040
We're going to have a good time,

23
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:32,251
man.

24
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:33,660
So there's some good fights tonight.

25
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,081
Uh,

26
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:34,411
Niki,

27
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:34,981
hold skins.

28
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:36,740
Fighting Israel at the sane.

29
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,071
Yes.

30
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:37,530
Fighting.

31
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,600
He's a bad motherfucker.

32
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,660
That's should be interesting.

33
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,101
And uh,

34
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:43,110
all this is live from Denver,

35
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,780
Colorado right now on UFC fight pass.

36
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,540
If you don't have UFC fight pass,

37
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,660
shame on you because a,

38
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,590
it's a great way to waste days,

39
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,030
days of time,

40
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:54,630
man.

41
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,530
You need to sit down and watch whatever
you want from anywhere in the world.

42
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,000
It's Netflix for fights.

43
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,230
This is what it is.

44
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,260
It's just like they have everything
from way back in the pride days.

45
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,490
All the old fade or fights,

46
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,880
the Vandelay fights back
in the early two thousands,

47
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:09,714
all that shit.

48
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,540
And it's fun to go back and watch
some of those little ones too.

49
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,890
Especially the pride tournament's.

50
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,551
Yeah,

51
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,080
man.

52
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,170
The golden days.

53
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,440
So the first fight of the night here
is Justin Holton versus Jonathan Wide

54
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,990
Darko.

55
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,823
Um,

56
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,843
and uh,

57
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,410
they're reading the glory rules.

58
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:25,950
Um,

59
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,660
did you do much kickboxing at all?

60
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,570
I had full amateur kickboxing fights,

61
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,440
um,

62
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,380
three and mature boxing
matches and to pro.

63
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,390
So was it American rules or Muay Thai
[inaudible] Muay Thai to American rules.

64
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,170
So it was,

65
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,003
it was fun.

66
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,371
I mean,

67
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,270
it was amateur,

68
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,890
so we were wearing headgear,

69
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,970
we didn't throw elbows,

70
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,560
but it was good.

71
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,490
I was undefeated,

72
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,200
so that's good then.

73
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,123
I like that.

74
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,900
Yeah.

75
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,950
It's interesting because,

76
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,370
um,

77
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:53,730
I,

78
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,730
I'm a huge fan of kickboxing and I'm
just kind of surprised that kickboxing

79
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:03,180
hasn't taken off in
America the way MMA has,

80
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,790
but I just don't think it's
been promoted the right way.

81
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,500
And Or,

82
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,351
and there was a,

83
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:12,330
a Dana white had a real good point and
he said that the reason why is because

84
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,164
people,

85
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,320
when you think of kickbox and they think
of PKA karate from ESPN at two o'clock

86
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,040
in the morning from the 1980s,

87
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,401
you know,

88
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,700
you have to throw this five kicks
the book and it was like Shitty,

89
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,830
sloppy boxing and they,

90
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:26,191
you know,

91
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,060
they would throw those,

92
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,810
they would barely throw those kicks and
then the pants they were wearing like

93
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:32,040
all of that was just crap.

94
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,613
Silly man.

95
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,940
They are fighting in
pajamas with the boots,

96
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,430
those big boots that they would
wear on the back on their feet.

97
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,500
What it is kinda interesting the boots,

98
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,440
because I brought this up many
times when it comes to um,

99
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,611
MMA.

100
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:47,300
Like why do your elbows
have nothing on him?

101
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,730
Why do your shins and knees have
nothing on him but your knuckles do,

102
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,940
which is like the easiest thing to break.

103
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,490
The hardest thing to hit
somebody hard with is a fist.

104
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,391
Yeah.

105
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:58,980
But you use those more.

106
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,360
And then then because of the cuts,

107
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,950
I think mostly for cuts,

108
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:05,530
bone on bone and that skin
getting pinched in between there.

109
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,000
For sure he's getting cut up.

110
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:07,781
That's true.

111
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,190
But isn't that the case with elbows?

112
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,271
Yeah,

113
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:12,910
but I mean it's harder
to land an elbow ignites.

114
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,120
Your name is Tim means it's
harder to land an elbow.

115
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:16,541
There it is.

116
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,440
The land punches.

117
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,700
There's a few guys that
are real elbow specialist.

118
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,623
Um,

119
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,090
Jordan means another one.

120
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,070
I remember when he fought Cyborg,

121
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,860
the other side board,

122
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,070
not the female to male
Cyborg and strike force.

123
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,791
Holy Shit.

124
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,620
That elbow combination,

125
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,340
man.

126
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,530
That's one thing I don't like about glory.

127
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,530
I really wish they would
go a full Moy Tai and um,

128
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,750
when Joe Schilling gets here,

129
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,051
you know,

130
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:41,980
Joe's obviously,

131
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:42,370
uh,

132
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,770
he's done both and he
started out in [inaudible].

133
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:49,771
He's a big Muay Thai fan and they're
having a lion fight is on tonight at the

134
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,681
same time.

135
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:53,050
So that's on access TV right now.

136
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,840
While this is going on right now on um,

137
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,120
on UFC fight pass.

138
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,850
I have never been,

139
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,541
I mean,

140
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,740
outside of an MMA fight,

141
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:03,880
I've never been hit with a,

142
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,530
with an elbow and Emily Tye fight.

143
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:09,010
I feel like that would throw me
off like it did for some reason.

144
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,450
I feel it's different than MMA.

145
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,320
Like in MMA,

146
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,363
I've never been hit.

147
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,440
I don't remember being hit
with an elbow on my feet,

148
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,910
but on the mat,

149
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,690
you know.

150
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,523
Um,

151
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,360
but in kickboxing,

152
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,750
I mean that's where you're at and I
don't know that it's kind of scary.

153
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,420
I've hit people with elbows
on my feet and it seems you'd,

154
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,340
it would,

155
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,060
it'd be shitty to be on the receiving end,

156
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:28,894
the one that knows,

157
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,570
I guess.

158
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,400
But it's very effective and I always
feel like anytime you're eliminating

159
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,110
effective aspects of striking,

160
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,211
I'll give you take moy,

161
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:42,220
Tai and you eliminate two
effective aspects of it.

162
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,660
Elbows and the clinch.

163
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:44,740
I mean,

164
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,161
those are,

165
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,800
those are two huge factors in fights,

166
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,030
especially the clinch.

167
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,571
I mean,

168
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:52,240
you take a guy like San Chai who
can dump people from anywhere.

169
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,350
He just flips dudes,

170
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:53,951
you know,

171
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:58,600
he's so good at the clinch and so good
at throwing elbows and knees to the body

172
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,434
from the clinch.

173
00:04:59,560 --> 00:04:59,831
Yeah,

174
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:00,250
I don't,

175
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:00,941
I would look more,

176
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,780
the only thing I really don't like about
Gloria is they feel like they do break

177
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,280
you from the clinch real quick.

178
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,480
We don't even have time to,

179
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:07,711
to,

180
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,890
to work in it needs in there.

181
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,783
Yeah.

182
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,790
I just feel like you should be able a to
defend yourself if you get hurt and be,

183
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:19,150
you should be able to work needs to
the body and elbows in the clench.

184
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:19,391
It's a,

185
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,310
it's just a massive part
of Muay Thai and uh,

186
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,870
they've,

187
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,660
they've just sort of eliminated
it to make it more exciting.

188
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:30,661
And it all came from k one k one
was like a big step up from PKA.

189
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:31,811
Karate.

190
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,610
It was a big step up from kickboxing,

191
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:38,611
but they develop some rules that they
thought would favor action and make things

192
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,564
go quicker.

193
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,561
Yeah.

194
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,360
I remember the first,

195
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,700
uh,

196
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,170
k one that was,

197
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,130
I think it was like,

198
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,371
what,

199
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:47,950
92 93 maybe [inaudible] 94 here.

200
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,580
Um,

201
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,920
where they advertised it as 80% knockouts.

202
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,030
Do you remember that?

203
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,290
80% knock guys,

204
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,760
they had five fights in the car at four.

205
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:55,780
Four ended by knockout.

206
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,250
That's so crazy.

207
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,880
80% knockouts.

208
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,200
It's so fucking crazy.

209
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,700
But I wouldn't be surprised.

210
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,481
I think,

211
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:02,900
um,

212
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,160
I know chemo fund on that.

213
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,670
Um,

214
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,211
oh wow.

215
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,100
That's Rasa.

216
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:08,300
Setaki wow.

217
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,930
Wow.

218
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,700
Oh that is so old school.

219
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,500
Think Good Ridge may fall on that too.

220
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,610
I don't remember for sure.

221
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:18,410
But it's just striking
becomes a completely different
animal when there's no

222
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,360
threat of the takedown.

223
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,213
Yeah,

224
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,960
it just does.

225
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,390
And it also becomes a completely
different animal when there's no,

226
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,190
the Moitai aspect is removed.

227
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,310
The no threat of the clinch
and no threat of the elbows.

228
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:28,791
Yeah,

229
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,180
that changes the range a lot.

230
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,970
You see guy easy,

231
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,150
what does the name hot
and just did a spin.

232
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,310
You don't see a whole
lot of spinning in MMA.

233
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,850
You get guys like wonder boy,

234
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,030
those guys that can do
it and they do it well,

235
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,860
but you don't see that as much in a,

236
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,090
if you watch the UFC card,

237
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,730
you want to see as many spins
as you do it and in glory.

238
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,181
Yeah.

239
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:50,220
I think really the only
way to get them all,

240
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:50,991
not the only way,

241
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,150
but it's,

242
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,220
it's so hard for guys who develop an
overall MMA game to ever be like really

243
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:00,860
effective with those kinds of
traditional martial arts techniques.

244
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,290
Because I feel like some of those
taekwondo techniques and kill Christian

245
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,143
techniques,

246
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,800
you have to start out with that stuff and
not worry about getting punched in the

247
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,330
face in order to develop them.

248
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:11,731
I,

249
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:15,260
that's a big aspect of kill Kachin and
a big aspect of taekwondo is that people

250
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,280
aren't punching you in the face.

251
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,930
Yeah.

252
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,420
Not Getting it.

253
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,720
Yeah,

254
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,411
because you're not,

255
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,340
you don't have that threat.

256
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,450
Yeah.

257
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,190
So you develop those crazy kicks and
the leg dexterity and then I feel like

258
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,020
that's a great stepping stone.

259
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,470
If you can go from that and then learn
how to wrestle and learn Jujitsu and

260
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,000
learn how to box and kickboxing,

261
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,190
then you'll always have those techniques.

262
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,760
But it's,

263
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,760
it's so rare that you take a guy who
is like a real from the beginning,

264
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,400
mixed martial arts fighter and
then develop that kind of ability.

265
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,331
Yeah.

266
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,081
I mean they,

267
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:45,281
they're,

268
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:47,820
they're focused on every
aspect of martial law.

269
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,130
She was almost too much to learn.

270
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,990
Yeah.

271
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,590
You have to be a Highlander
to get it all down.

272
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,391
Yeah.

273
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,224
It's,

274
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,621
it's,

275
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:58,820
it's so rare that anybody has like
a full game that starts out from the

276
00:07:58,821 --> 00:07:59,330
beginning.

277
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,910
But you know,

278
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,800
I think we're seeing these guys today,

279
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,460
which is Kinda,

280
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,600
it's an interesting time.

281
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,050
There's the real specialists like
Wonderboy and on the other end,

282
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,070
like Damien Maia,

283
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:10,761
you know,

284
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,560
seeing real specialists,

285
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,720
you don't see that as much anymore.

286
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:14,991
I mean,

287
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,090
guys were individual
specialists back in the day,

288
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:17,661
but now you get,

289
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:17,950
yeah,

290
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,900
you get a guy like wanting to,

291
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:19,070
boy,

292
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,270
you get a guy like Stephen Thompson,

293
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,571
I,

294
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,470
me and Tyron Woodley,

295
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:22,190
great wrestler.

296
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,990
He started mixing the rest into his game.

297
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,360
Then you get these guys like Dustin pull
a Messiah backtick that came up doing

298
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,930
MMA and they're really good
at different aspects of it.

299
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:36,410
Real strong and say the
wrestling and Jujitsu,

300
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,700
good kickboxing,

301
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,850
but you put them in,

302
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,071
in,

303
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:39,831
in a ring with,

304
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:40,041
with uh,

305
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:40,874
Joe Schilling,

306
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,440
Schilling Ladies Gentlemen,

307
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,150
as if on cue

308
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,130
Joe showing where there's a draw them on.

309
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,010
We were just talking about the
difference between a real specialists,

310
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,130
a high level specialty,

311
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,140
like a Stephen Thompson in MMA versus a
guy like a Dustin Poirier who's a very

312
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:02,934
good striker.

313
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,280
But Wonderboy is something special,

314
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:05,740
you know,

315
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,080
that level.

316
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,771
His debts,

317
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:08,310
like,

318
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,780
you know,

319
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,780
he was something ridiculous like 37 and
know as a kickboxer and his UFC career,

320
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:18,030
he's only lost a matte brown and fight
where he said he overtrained for that

321
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:18,361
fight.

322
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:18,751
And you know,

323
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:22,140
Matt is obviously a savage and
early in his UFC career too.

324
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,740
Yeah,

325
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,460
yeah.

326
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,510
So there's the first fight,

327
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,733
Joe Schilling,

328
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,570
and I know you're a huge fan of glory.

329
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,500
The organization,

330
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,390
the way they treat the
fighters once they leave.

331
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,531
Absolutely.

332
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:32,700
We already discussed that.

333
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,260
It's good,

334
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,160
it's good for the sport.

335
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,780
It's good that,

336
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,060
you know,

337
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,950
like Laurie has done for kickboxing.

338
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,880
This is awesome.

339
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,420
This is great.

340
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,560
It is good for the sport.

341
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,700
I love the sport.

342
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,563
And um,

343
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,000
and I think everyone here,

344
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,360
we want it to do better.

345
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:45,930
It's just,

346
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,100
it's doesn't get nearly the amount of
attention or respect that it deserves.

347
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,371
Yeah,

348
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:50,941
it's crazy.

349
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:51,930
It should definitely,

350
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:52,201
I mean,

351
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:53,070
kickboxing is,

352
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,910
is a very exciting sport when you,

353
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:55,651
and you sit down,

354
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:58,620
you watch these guys and you see
some of the knockouts guys pull off.

355
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,001
I was watching,

356
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm Tyrone Spong and,

357
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:01,671
and,

358
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:05,520
and Solow Calamari.

359
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,530
Right.

360
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:06,781
And,

361
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,120
and the way he cracked
him with that overhead.

362
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,150
I love seeing guys get hurt but survive
get through that round because you get a

363
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:15,441
guy like,

364
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:17,880
like title and spawn was a
killer and he's coming after you.

365
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:18,780
He's trying to finish,

366
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:20,870
but you have to be smart brains.

367
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,620
When you dropped Tyrone in New York,

368
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,790
that was a Michael Dunn.

369
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,000
I think Tyrone got up and
they knocked them out.

370
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,840
Yeah.

371
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,631
White guy over here.

372
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:29,191
Yeah.

373
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,360
That was crazy.

374
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:30,960
That was,

375
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,990
that was because that whole
exchange was 30 seconds.

376
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:34,650
Yeah.

377
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,483
He dropped,

378
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,120
he dropped Tyron and t and then Tyrone
got back up and knocked him out.

379
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,140
I just flashed him.

380
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:40,351
I'm like,

381
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:40,430
oh,

382
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,661
one,

383
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:44,250
two down the pipe and Tom
Bonds in a weird place,

384
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:45,084
right?

385
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,241
Yeah.

386
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:45,990
I don't know.

387
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know what these
kind of halfway kickboxing,

388
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:50,100
halfway boxing is boxing now.

389
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,930
He has a boxing fight recently.

390
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:52,260
Man.

391
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,093
He's had a few,

392
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:53,540
well,

393
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,660
when he broke his leg,

394
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,201
when he fought,

395
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:56,034
go Saki.

396
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,500
That was another one of
those Anderson Silva style.

397
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,910
Leg breaks is nasty.

398
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:00,690
Uh,

399
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,890
check leg breaks.

400
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,730
It was bad.

401
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,410
You see that one?

402
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,100
Oh,

403
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,850
I saw that disgusting.

404
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,420
How many times have you seen that
Joe in the flesh and the flesh?

405
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:10,000
Never.

406
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,580
I would never see it in the flesh.

407
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,660
I've seen it twice.

408
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,951
Corey Hill,

409
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:14,730
Corey Hill,

410
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,150
and answer for that too.

411
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,060
What I hate about that is
your body's still reacting.

412
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:23,130
You throw in that kick and
you're putting that foot down.

413
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,413
You don't feel it.

414
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,590
Now you put that foot down,

415
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,760
then you see it goes rubber on you.

416
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,200
Kelly's touching the side of your knee.

417
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,050
Oh,

418
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,210
that's gotta be so hard to get over that.

419
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:40,690
To the point where you're capable of
throwing kicks to like to the mentally

420
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,790
convinced mental,

421
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,570
uh,

422
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,080
yeah,

423
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,913
it's real tough.

424
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,940
Real tough to come by from.

425
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,013
Yeah.

426
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,591
Yeah.

427
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:47,350
And well,

428
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,500
uh,

429
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,320
blegh break in and of itself
is so dangerous because
first of all when it gets,

430
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,680
when it's a compound fracture,

431
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:54,310
it's insanely

432
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,530
dangerous cause there's
massive risks of infection.

433
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,510
But when it's a,

434
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:58,861
a,

435
00:11:58,861 --> 00:11:59,770
a leg break,

436
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:02,260
there's also an issue with circulation.

437
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,790
Like Frank Mir,

438
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,630
when he broke his leg,

439
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:05,800
when he got in that car accident,

440
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,930
he wasn't good for a year,

441
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,990
a year plus his leg was fucked up for
like a year later and his knee was fucked

442
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:14,794
up from,

443
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,633
you know,

444
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,720
having his leg bolted together
and kind of fucked up as knee.

445
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,630
What bothers me most about that is how
much pain those dudes are in instantly.

446
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:25,931
I mean,

447
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:27,580
when you're in a fight and you get cut,

448
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,121
you get hit,

449
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:29,050
you get like,

450
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:29,884
you feel it,

451
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,530
but it's like you can
deal with it like that.

452
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,370
Yeah.

453
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,220
They just look like they're
in agony right away.

454
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,350
That adrenaline is not
enough to stop that pain.

455
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:37,631
No,

456
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,450
nobody just sucks it up when
their legs snaps in half.

457
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,670
That Andersen,

458
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,910
when Andersen fog Weidman
and he's just screaming,

459
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,181
you know,

460
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,250
you never see that from Anderson ever.

461
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,480
There was one,

462
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,530
I had a fight once.

463
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:50,831
And you,

464
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:54,850
you had said something about how I'm
good at throwing that inside leg kick.

465
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,871
And I was like,

466
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:56,201
yeah,

467
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,430
when I watched it later I was like yeah,

468
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,780
cause I don't wanna get my shit broken.

469
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,550
I tried to hide that as best
as I can be in a south bum.

470
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,520
Yeah.

471
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,300
Cause that's the scariest thing right
inside leg kick to that Shin on the

472
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:08,440
opposite side fighter.

473
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,250
Yeah.

474
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,500
That the South Palsy
ruin it when it happens.

475
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,330
I said Tyrone was just like full power
and that sockies knee like oh yeah.

476
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:18,760
Full power.

477
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,680
And that's Tyrone style too.

478
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:21,560
He's just such a,

479
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,420
uh,

480
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,740
explosive guy.

481
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,390
Like what a boss said about it made a
lot of sense to me where he described it

482
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,170
as like a,

483
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,003
like a ruler,

484
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,181
Pencil,

485
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,014
ruler.

486
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,003
And when you hit,

487
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,680
you know,

488
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,301
the South Pole,

489
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:38,140
you ended up kind of boss explains
a lot better than maybe what the,

490
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:38,770
uh,

491
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,720
the ruler hits the flat side of
the Shin Hits like the floods out.

492
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,880
Why has the ability to break so easy
versus going straight out of that totally

493
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:46,714
makes sense.

494
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,700
And then there's of course
the knee and the upper air,

495
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:48,991
the need,

496
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:51,070
which is just like kicking a boulder,

497
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:51,761
you know,

498
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,650
it's like the top of the knee especially.

499
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:54,550
It's so hard.

500
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,150
Yeah.

501
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,500
And the top of the Shin to,

502
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:56,741
you know,

503
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:56,930
when you,

504
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,763
uh,

505
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,000
your Shin is a sharp or toward the bottom,

506
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:01,930
but it gets much thicker,

507
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:02,561
much denser.

508
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:02,801
So,

509
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,460
uh,

510
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,071
he felt like a,

511
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:07,150
a solid leg kicking you land on the upper
Shin is when you really get like the

512
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,050
funk.

513
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,970
I remember there was a
fight and lion fight.

514
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,530
I don't remember who mallet pet fought,

515
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,430
but uh,

516
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,300
he was,

517
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:13,870
uh,

518
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,620
he,

519
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,260
the dude checked his leg
kick and it hurt him.

520
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,640
He could tell it hurt him.

521
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,670
So Mal pet started swinging at his shins
and he just kept throwing those leg

522
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:24,280
kicks.

523
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,091
Adis Shins.

524
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,440
It was just so nasty.

525
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,540
It was that that was,

526
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,540
I don't remember who it was.

527
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,020
I remember it and I
don't think I saw that.

528
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,070
It was one of it.

529
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,650
Was that when Cyborg flood on that car?

530
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
Uh,

531
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:34,840
I dunno,

532
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,630
might've been,

533
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,131
it might've been,

534
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:36,964
might've been.

535
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
I train them out of the pet man,

536
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,160
that guy,

537
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,431
you know,

538
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:43,660
a ballot that means no
diamond and that guy,

539
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:46,390
his shins are like diamond heart.

540
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,260
We were drilling one day and we're going
back and forth and I throw a kick and

541
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:51,094
he checked me,

542
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:51,980
he throws a kick

543
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,551
and I check him.

544
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:53,540
He's not kicking me hard.

545
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,580
I mean he's literally
kicking like that hard.

546
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,070
And I checked it and I
didn't like how it felt.

547
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,130
So I saw him doing a kick
again and I seriously thought,

548
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,390
don't even block that cause where he's
not kicking you hard so it's not going to

549
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:05,750
hurt.

550
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,770
But if you check it at will,

551
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,610
right.

552
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,410
The bad guy.

553
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:08,770
He's,

554
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,411
he's little,

555
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:10,011
he's tiny,

556
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,060
but he hits so hard,

557
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,020
can't clench with him.

558
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,460
Beats me up in the clinch.

559
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,410
I got like 2030 pounds on him.

560
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,450
It's beaten me up so much experience.

561
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,410
And the,

562
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:18,620
you know,

563
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,850
they call it old bones.

564
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,751
Yeah.

565
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,460
They start when they're babies.

566
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,750
Old Bones.

567
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:26,410
That's an interesting way to put it
in until the ties referred to them.

568
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,460
Well that's the same with grappling to,

569
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,620
you ever wrestle with a
guy like Randy coture?

570
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,680
He clinch up with a guy like that and
there's just something about them when

571
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,720
they've been throwing people
around their whole life,

572
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,670
they got this weird feel to them.

573
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,750
It just doesn't feel right.

574
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,683
Yeah.

575
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,101
Yeah.

576
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:41,350
I trained with Tyron when he,

577
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:42,890
he had a broken arm at the time,

578
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,030
so he's in a cast.

579
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,140
He's not even using it.

580
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,273
I can't do anything.

581
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,050
He's lifted me with one hand.

582
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:49,780
He's putting me on the fancy word,

583
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,720
straight wrestling,

584
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:54,710
but it's like he's wrestling with the
child and he had shot passed on and the

585
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,280
cast.

586
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,961
That's hilarious.

587
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:59,360
And he wrestled with another guy that
wrestled that at Missouri also and took

588
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:00,170
him down.

589
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,820
And this is a college level wrestler?

590
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,640
Well Woodley's so unusual in that
he has unbelievable knockout power,

591
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,440
but he didn't start out as a striker.

592
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,100
You know,

593
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,100
he's just snap an explosion that he's got
his ability to like close the distance

594
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:16,890
with one punch too.

595
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,930
I really noticed it.

596
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:18,710
I've been,

597
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,820
I've noticed that in many fights,

598
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:22,670
but the one time when
he fought Carlos condit,

599
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,070
I remember he closed the distance
and land at the right hand.

600
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,810
You know how your brain sees people
doing stuff and things seemed normal.

601
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,760
Like oh that's a good punch
or that's a good kick,

602
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,050
but it seems normal.

603
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,000
But every now and then someone
will do something and you go,

604
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,451
Whoa,

605
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:36,021
what the fuck?

606
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:36,280
They just,

607
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,000
we just miss a couple of frames there.

608
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,360
Like it was like something
was cut out of the fray.

609
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,760
He's so fast.

610
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:42,260
Yeah.

611
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,970
And for a guy that's that big,

612
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,610
to be able to close the
distance so fast and punch you,

613
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:47,360
he like,

614
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,100
you could tell like condit was like,

615
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,461
oh,

616
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:50,294
okay,

617
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,750
okay.

618
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,690
And this mother fucker could
punch me from over there.

619
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:53,524
Like this is,

620
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,890
this is a whole different kind of thing.

621
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,210
I think that's how a lot of
people feel when they're fighting

622
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,883
Wonderboy now.

623
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,370
Oh yeah.

624
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:00,700
It's,

625
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,001
you know,

626
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,190
you're talking earlier about his,

627
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,120
you know,

628
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,290
with a high level striker,

629
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:04,621
he is,

630
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:08,000
but he's a high level striker at a
style that you don't see very often.

631
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,320
And you're going to MMA gym
anywhere across the country.

632
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:14,370
You're going to see fundamentals
of Muy Thai boxing and whatnot.

633
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,821
You know what I mean?

634
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:15,330
Be Barely,

635
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,260
rarely are going to see guys throwing
late up Cresson kicks and all this fucking

636
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,981
karate point.

637
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:20,814
Karate Shit.

638
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,000
I am in a Raymond Daniels similar style.

639
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:24,511
When you're in there,

640
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:24,751
you're like,

641
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,220
what the fuck is going on?

642
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:27,570
And then he ended up
standing in front of them,

643
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:28,404
which is what they want.

644
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:28,901
Well,

645
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:30,960
he's got way better hands and Raymond now,

646
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,300
right?

647
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,060
The thing that makes him like Raymond
is getting better with his hands,

648
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:37,180
but Raymond has issues when guys
close the distance and smother him,

649
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,710
like with Niki holds can did like
with Joseph Valtellina did to him.

650
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:41,931
But wonder what,

651
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:44,290
I don't have any problem with that
and wonder where his hands are nasty.

652
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,340
And he also has this weird thing he does
where he pivots from his hip back and

653
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:52,500
forth like a fucking snake and like he's
so good at like moving back and forth

654
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:53,334
from his hips.

655
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,100
And that's like a lot of
that point karate stuff.

656
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,143
Yeah.

657
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:57,691
Yeah.

658
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:58,524
I don't,

659
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,370
I'm excited about that flavor
because of those two dynamics.

660
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,120
Because the tire and speed and one,

661
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:05,580
one boy's got good range too,

662
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:07,080
but tiring can close that gap.

663
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,630
And then one of the boys creativity with,

664
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:09,871
with,

665
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:10,830
with what he does,

666
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,450
like he throws everything at you.

667
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,970
Tyrons got that one punch power though.

668
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,630
That one punch thing is just so
disturbing because he could just,

669
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,040
the last fight with
Lawler was out of nowhere.

670
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,840
Nowhere.

671
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,810
And he can do that at any
point in time to anybody.

672
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,130
Yeah.

673
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,720
To anybody.

674
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,250
And there's no one that
can take that shot.

675
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,611
You just,

676
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:29,780
you,

677
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
you can't get hit by it.

678
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,800
You can't get hit like that.

679
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,000
Whereas Wonderboy is much
more of an accumulation type,

680
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,690
uh,

681
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,740
damaged door.

682
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,840
But you know,

683
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,181
wonder boy,

684
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:41,130
he's been hit before.

685
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,551
You know,

686
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:46,530
like you gotta think Jake Ellenberger
hit him and hurt him and uh,

687
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:46,801
you know,

688
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:47,940
Jake's got real power to,

689
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:49,620
of course he hit him and hurt him.

690
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,690
So it's,

691
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,400
it's really a matter of whether or
not he can stay the fuck away for,

692
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,060
um,

693
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,130
as long as it takes a slow tyrant down.

694
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,730
Yeah.

695
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,790
And then get his hit the
weird game that he has,

696
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,280
particularly with his front leg,

697
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,790
he can do shit with his front
leg that you just do not expect.

698
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,020
Front leg sidekicks,

699
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,801
front leg,

700
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:11,461
roundhouse kicks.

701
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:15,870
He's sneak some over the shoulder and
drops him down on you throwing that lead

702
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:16,704
leg hook kick.

703
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,823
Yeah.

704
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,541
That's that shit.

705
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:18,870
I mean,

706
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,640
like when you're like,

707
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,060
what the fuck is going on?

708
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,850
Worry.

709
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,530
Uh,

710
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,251
Johnny Hendricks.

711
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:26,521
He's like,

712
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:27,171
yeah,

713
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:27,420
no.

714
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,253
Like what?

715
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,621
You know?

716
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:31,350
And then now you're a target for
that guy who was just doing his shit,

717
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:32,070
you know?

718
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah.

719
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,970
Scary.

720
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,151
Well,

721
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,890
that sideways stance too,

722
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,480
he stands like completely karate style
sideways with his hands down and it's

723
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,440
just a different thing.

724
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,240
It's a totally different
style of movement.

725
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,420
And that was the one style
of martial art that I was,

726
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,220
I've been waiting for for a while.

727
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:48,730
And you've seen it now with um,

728
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,620
uh,

729
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,540
Michael Page and Bella Tor to this
style of the point karate guy.

730
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,040
Those support guys who can,

731
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,790
they can close the distance so fast and
get the fuck out of the way so fast.

732
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,600
They're just a completely different thing
and they're real good at countering to

733
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,450
like Michael Page is a
master at countering.

734
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,790
Yeah.

735
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,623
I'm,

736
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm not hating on Michael painted
and hate that gangly pseudo style.

737
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,781
Oh Dude.

738
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:13,690
The dancing stuff.

739
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,640
I don't know why.

740
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,890
Why do you hate it poly?

741
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:21,790
Because I feel like I'm a
classic like old school heart.

742
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,630
Just put your notes to the
grant and do it the right way.

743
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,290
Right.

744
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,240
But I understand that's his style,

745
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,830
but for some reason it just
bothers the hell out of it.

746
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,031
Well,

747
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,490
don't you think that's also a big
part of why it's so effective?

748
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,540
Because it bothers the fuck
out of his opponents too.

749
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,610
It's like you do not want to get knocked
out by a dude's gonna dance afterwards.

750
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,930
Dance during dance.

751
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,360
Right before he kaos you,

752
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:43,651
you know,

753
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:48,040
Fuck Battersea Richard Abraham's up

754
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,550
next.

755
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,660
Mike Methey Eda.

756
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,400
We haven't talked about a fight yet.

757
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,440
I like Abraham man.

758
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:53,830
Yeah,

759
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,700
I like how he fights.

760
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,750
He's pretty aggressive.

761
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:56,200
He,

762
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,520
he likes to throw big bombs.

763
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,181
I call,

764
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:59,200
I call what he does.

765
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,610
[inaudible] Muy Thai hood.

766
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,150
Moitai that's funny though.

767
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,033
Jitsu.

768
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,650
How did you come up with Thug Jitsu man?

769
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:08,971
There was,

770
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,330
there was Houston was a big,

771
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,670
a Jujitsu town and some,

772
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,980
somebody was using it as
like trying to denigrate me.

773
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:15,191
You know,

774
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:15,671
they were like,

775
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,504
if you want to,

776
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,100
you want to train some good Jujitsu,

777
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,380
you come over here and you train
with this guy and this guy.

778
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:22,540
But if you want to go learn
some of that thug Jitsu,

779
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,120
you go train with eve and
Saul and those guys because,

780
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,500
because we were doing kicks and punches
knees and then they didn't like that.

781
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,960
They just wanted to do some
missions and do positioning and,

782
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:32,620
and that was it.

783
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,580
Nobody wanted to get hit in Houston back
in the nineties Oh that's interesting.

784
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:38,890
Joke's on you fucking ran with that shit.

785
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,030
I saw you fight for first time it hook
and shoot dude against Aaron Riley.

786
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,310
What year was that?

787
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,110
That was the 90s right?

788
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,230
No,

789
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,590
first time was the nineties I
think the second time was 2001 no,

790
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,720
2000 old school man.

791
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:55,971
That,

792
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:58,030
that is as old school as you get right.

793
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,590
Makes me feel old.

794
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,470
Those were great fights though,

795
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:03,304
man.

796
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,900
Those are great fights.

797
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,203
I don't,

798
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,700
it's weird cause I liked beaten up.

799
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:10,534
Aaron Riley.

800
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,123
Aaron was tough.

801
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,353
You know what I mean?

802
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,830
He was tough but he wouldn't stop.

803
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,090
Like he wouldn't quit.

804
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,650
But um,

805
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:16,860
the,

806
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,010
the second time we fought,

807
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,610
it was one point where I,

808
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:24,010
Atlanta did a knee like to the face and
then just saw blood immediately after.

809
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,240
I surely felt like,

810
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:28,330
felt like I need a burlap
sack of light bulbs.

811
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,583
That's what it felt like.

812
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,840
It was disgust.

813
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,720
Oh Man.

814
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:34,220
A burlap sack.

815
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,000
I remember thinking during
the fight when that happened.

816
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:40,391
I was like,

817
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:41,580
that felt like light bulbs.

818
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,850
Oh my God.

819
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,470
What do you think it felt like when
Michael Page landed that neon cyborg when

820
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:51,880
its forehead Kayden Cyborg so crazy.

821
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:52,061
He's like,

822
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:53,260
I'll be fighting to get in three months.

823
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,910
Like what?

824
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,833
I hope not.

825
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,710
I hope not.

826
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,770
The way he went down to that was another
one of those times when you see a guy

827
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,540
in agony in the cage,

828
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,760
that's no man.

829
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:05,080
I don't know if I'm fighting after that.

830
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,430
You can get hit in the head a lot.

831
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,050
That's bugs the shit out of me the most
about I pokes when when someone gets

832
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:14,320
jabbed in the eye and you see him scream
out and cover their eyes and turn their

833
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:16,720
back then and we tried to
defend themselves sometimes.

834
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,580
Anthony Johnson one was the worst.

835
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:18,851
Oh yeah,

836
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:19,690
with Kevin Burns.

837
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,960
Yeah.

838
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,460
Yeah,

839
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,930
I've seen a gang of them now,

840
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:23,764
man.

841
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,980
I just don't know why they
don't go to the pride gloves.

842
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:28,990
I mean it just seemed
at this point in time,

843
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:29,950
like a no brainer.

844
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,720
It just doesn't make any
sense to me whatsoever.

845
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:35,980
They continue to have these gloves that
not only is it hard to keep your hand

846
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:36,640
curled,

847
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,420
but it like it.

848
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,130
It's trying to open your hands,

849
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,980
like the UFC gloves are
trying to open your hands,

850
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,360
like to keep your hands close,

851
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:44,560
you have to force them down.

852
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,190
Whereas the pride gloves,

853
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,580
it was hard to open them a prod gloves
or keeping your hands like that.

854
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,290
So as you're throwing punches,

855
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,641
you know,

856
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:57,380
I just think also two guys had the half
to get away from doing this open palm

857
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:59,420
thing to the face to push guys off.

858
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,220
And I think when guys do that,

859
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,840
they should be penalized at point.

860
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:03,520
You know,

861
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,820
how do you stop them from doing that?

862
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:05,930
That's such an instinct.

863
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,890
It is an instinct,

864
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:08,600
but I think some guys don't do whatever.

865
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,901
You know?

866
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,310
There's a lot of fighters who never,

867
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,840
never guilty of I pokes.

868
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,980
So why is that?

869
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,440
I mean it's not like
it's impossible to avoid.

870
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,260
I think they just have to make it so
that if you poke somebody in the eye,

871
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,810
it's an instantaneous one point deduction.

872
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,681
And people say,

873
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:22,660
well that's too harsh.

874
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,270
You know,

875
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,170
they didn't mean to do it.

876
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,430
Maybe they didn't mean to do it,

877
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,960
but it still was done.

878
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,390
So the opponents still suffered damage,

879
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,910
you know when you poke
somebody in the eye,

880
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,130
how many times do you see like a Matt
Mitre on Travis Brown fight where a guy

881
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:37,880
gets poked in the eye and also in the
whole fight changes and then one guy's in

882
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:39,950
trouble and he's not in
trouble from a legal technique.

883
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:42,870
He's in trouble from getting poked and
then the dynamic of the fight changes.

884
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,850
He can't see so good.

885
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,320
And then he winds up getting fucked up.

886
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,550
See they should just stop,

887
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,950
walk to the guy over a good look and then

888
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,240
come back at five minutes.

889
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,650
So we'll see that.

890
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,610
That would be crazy.

891
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:57,200
Manage of guys were allowed to poke you.

892
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,790
I'll give you poke someone in the eye.

893
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,740
They're allowed to come over
and they get a free poke.

894
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,130
Love it.

895
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,470
Oh wasn't that,

896
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,320
wasn't that one of the
first rules that was like,

897
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:06,840
it was just like,

898
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,673
no,

899
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:07,901
no.

900
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:08,734
It was just no,

901
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,930
no fish hooking or something.

902
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:11,631
No fish hooking.

903
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:12,110
No idea.

904
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,450
No,

905
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,000
I college and you were
allowed to grab hair.

906
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,230
You were allowed to punch nuts.

907
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,490
Keith Hackney.

908
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,250
But some guys just have done
it so many times on Joe San.

909
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,093
Yeah man.

910
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,221
How crazy.

911
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,300
That Joe's Han story.

912
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,410
That's one of the craziest stories.

913
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:24,891
And all of them,

914
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:25,670
I may,

915
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,200
Joe San,

916
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,120
who seemed like this lovable
guy who was really into Jesus,

917
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,020
it seemed kind of crazy.

918
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:31,520
He used to come to the
comedy store and hang out,

919
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,300
hung out with Joe Shaw sign a bunch of
times because he was friends with Bobby

920
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,690
Lee.

921
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,790
So He'd come down to the commerce talk.

922
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:37,541
He was jacked.

923
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,830
It was three feet tall and two feet wide.

924
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,390
He was jacked,

925
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:41,930
you know,

926
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,220
and he would,

927
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:43,430
uh,

928
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,750
he was just real weird.

929
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,580
It felt like almost dangerous around.

930
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:46,830
I'm like,

931
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,110
it's Kinda,

932
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,230
it's just seems so odd.

933
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,570
And then they do some,

934
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:55,100
he got arrested for something and they
do some random DNA test on them and find

935
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:56,630
out he was a part of a gang rape.

936
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,510
And now he's in jail for life.

937
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,430
He's in jail and while he's in jail,

938
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:02,560
he killed his celly.

939
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:03,720
Yeah,

940
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,553
I didn't know that.

941
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,170
Killed a cellmate.

942
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,393
I'm pretty sure.

943
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,840
See if that's the case.

944
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,540
Joe Sohn Kills Cell Mate.

945
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,413
I'm pretty sure he did.

946
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,341
But yeah,

947
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:14,540
he's in jail for life now.

948
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,613
That's a wrap.

949
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,720
But it just,

950
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,890
what the fuck man.

951
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,933
Out of nowhere,

952
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,220
I forget what they arrested him for two,

953
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:22,750
but it was,

954
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,141
it was,

955
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:24,890
it wasn't anything like that.

956
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,320
Joe's yeah.

957
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,120
Possible murderer.

958
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,323
Uh,

959
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,370
he's a crazy dude,

960
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:31,880
man.

961
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,300
For sure.

962
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,780
Rapist.

963
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,100
A possible murder for sure.

964
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:34,934
Rapist.

965
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,140
I remember when he walked into the cage
with a fucking cross strapped to his

966
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:39,561
back,

967
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:40,580
him and chemo,

968
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,540
both those guys,

969
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,950
it was so up with Jesus.

970
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:47,040
They had a walk to the cage with
a cross strapped to their back.

971
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,050
Even Jesus himself and be like,

972
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:49,321
guys,

973
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:49,591
guys,

974
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:50,424
guys,

975
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,080
that was a long time ago.

976
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:53,610
We don't need to do this anymore.

977
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,740
Cause his cellmate was a
convicted child molester.

978
00:26:58,741 --> 00:26:59,700
So and did he kill him?

979
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,563
Yeah,

980
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,000
he was standing over the body off him.

981
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,810
So he was found standing
at the door with cell,

982
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,661
the body of his cellmate,

983
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:08,400
50 year old convicted child molester.

984
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:10,920
Michael Graham was lying
unresponsive in the bottom bunk.

985
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,630
He's pronounced dead.

986
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,673
Hmm.

987
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,680
Well I gave him a pass on that.

988
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,420
Give them a pass on child molester.

989
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:21,810
He said he killed grant with a
combination of kicks and punches.

990
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,201
Sohn.

991
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:23,280
Pleaded not guilty.

992
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,030
Yeah.

993
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,380
Oh Wow.

994
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,850
When you said son,

995
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:28,330
I thought though.

996
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,380
Cause you say that a lot.

997
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,650
Oh son with a combination.

998
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,260
Uh,

999
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,861
all right,

1000
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:39,694
here we go.

1001
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,900
Be a pretty good one.

1002
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,080
I thought that was from wearing the why
Colin his head one time I saw him fight,

1003
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:45,730
but I guess that's a
real mark on his head.

1004
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,001
Oh,

1005
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:46,834
okay.

1006
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,950
You guys,

1007
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,870
have you ever fought in Denver II?

1008
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,101
Yeah.

1009
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:55,934
High altitude.

1010
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,730
Nate and I fought and I fought Nate.

1011
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,160
Nate was 163 pounds.

1012
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,750
I was like one 62.

1013
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,860
Nate used to be 163 that's crazy.

1014
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:06,930
It's like 19 though.

1015
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,143
Wow.

1016
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,190
He's back to one 85 now,

1017
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:10,520
right?

1018
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,353
Yeah.

1019
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,360
He just,

1020
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:12,780
he just,

1021
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,000
he just won by knockout.

1022
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,863
Yeah.

1023
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,680
Amazing.

1024
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,070
You'd be knocked out tandem
or core with a head kick.

1025
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,680
That dude has been around
a long fucking time.

1026
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,420
Nate and I flatten 99.

1027
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,553
Wow.

1028
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,670
That's amazing.

1029
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,740
Named Mark Hart,

1030
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,431
you know,

1031
00:28:28,431 --> 00:28:28,880
um,

1032
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,720
Brendan Schaub said he's never seen
Nate lose a single round in the gym.

1033
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,891
And he,

1034
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:37,700
one of the things he said about Nate is
that Nate is probably one of those guys

1035
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:38,930
that left too much in a jam.

1036
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,260
Just had way too many Jim Morris with
Shane car when he used to spar with Shane

1037
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,470
fucking Carwyn,

1038
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,580
which is like what?

1039
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,110
I didn't realize how big he was.

1040
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:49,550
I saw the Ellis mania thing.

1041
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,560
Oh we can't holy shit.

1042
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,620
Well he like this like requiring dirt
like well you have one arm tied to his

1043
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,193
body,

1044
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,630
which is even more insane.

1045
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,750
They will start taping
arm to his body and yes,

1046
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:05,301
two people,

1047
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:06,890
they had to make gloves wore in the UFC.

1048
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,171
He's he,

1049
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:07,880
him and Brock.

1050
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,570
Yeah.

1051
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:08,900
His,

1052
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,150
his hands are bigger than Brock's.

1053
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,050
That's ridiculous.

1054
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,883
Yeah.

1055
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,370
I remember I was at um,

1056
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,653
um,

1057
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,930
where the fuck was I?

1058
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:19,760
Oh,

1059
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,593
I was,

1060
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,360
I was at a mall Easton's Jujitsu,

1061
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,890
a school in Boulder and I was on the
mat when we were trained and we're doing

1062
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,910
drills and now the corner of my eye,

1063
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,800
see what looks like the thing
from the comic book movie.

1064
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,090
Fantastic four.

1065
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,380
It looks like the thing,

1066
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:39,620
like if the thing was a real
person walking in and I look up,

1067
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,180
what the fuck is that?

1068
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,690
And it's Carwyn in between fights,

1069
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:43,951
you know,

1070
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,080
he would get to like
300 plus pounds and uh,

1071
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,291
you know,

1072
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,040
cause he was,

1073
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,120
he was a giant.

1074
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,541
I mean,

1075
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,370
he was giant and I saw him walking.

1076
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:52,120
I just remember going,

1077
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,290
what in the fuck?

1078
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:54,930
Like what are you,

1079
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,070
what do what I can see.

1080
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,300
I can't imagine what
Nate does with that guy.

1081
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,360
I just realized what the thing,

1082
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,530
the thing that was made of rocks.

1083
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,463
Yeah.

1084
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,830
I mean that was the size of him.

1085
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,210
He was so fucking big
that carbon has that,

1086
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,430
that weird power to where he can knock
dudes out with like six inch punches.

1087
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,740
Like he knocked out Gonzaga
Gonzaga had him hurt.

1088
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,761
And then he,

1089
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:19,300
uh,

1090
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,680
as he's wobbling backwards,

1091
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:25,681
he uncorked a six inch punch that
puts Gonzaga in the dark lands,

1092
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,611
stuff like that.

1093
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:30,550
It's still weird because think
about the fight with him and,

1094
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:30,821
and,

1095
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:31,101
and,

1096
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:33,100
and Brock and Canada in Vancouver,

1097
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,160
and he beat the snot out
of Broccoli first round.

1098
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,930
He just didn't conserve himself enough.

1099
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,660
Any gas,

1100
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:38,910
right.

1101
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,130
Yeah,

1102
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:39,940
I remember it.

1103
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,773
Gas Hard,

1104
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:45,250
trying to put them away first round and
Brock isn't a guy that they can take a

1105
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:47,360
lot of like a punishment like that.

1106
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:52,300
You don't think he brought that guy but
he survived it and turned it back on?

1107
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,740
Well somehow or another,

1108
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,150
somehow or another he survived it,

1109
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:59,200
but I feel like to this day that have
car would've just stayed calm and just

1110
00:30:59,201 --> 00:30:59,861
kept that fight.

1111
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:00,910
Standing and striking.

1112
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:04,420
Brock was fucked because he
was a commensurate wrestler.

1113
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:04,780
I mean,

1114
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,370
I mean he might not have been as good
a wrestler in wrestling as Brock is,

1115
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,980
but in MMA he's right the fuck up.

1116
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:12,401
They're like,

1117
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:13,600
good luck taking them down,

1118
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,940
especially when you've got to get
close enough for him to tag you.

1119
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,710
I feel like to this day that if he just
stayed calm and just box the fuck out of

1120
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:21,041
Brock,

1121
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:23,290
he'd be in the UFC
heavyweight champion for sure.

1122
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,080
But he just tried to
just end it real quick.

1123
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,780
Which makes sense because when you see,

1124
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:32,170
when you see Brock run away from some of
the shots that he ran away from before

1125
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,170
that and chain hits like he hits.

1126
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,710
Yeah,

1127
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,271
exactly.

1128
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,460
And just close the show and then he's big.

1129
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:39,850
Right?

1130
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,560
I mean like he's way bigger than Mark Hun.

1131
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,371
Yeah,

1132
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:43,300
he's Mark [inaudible].

1133
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,980
It was kind of the same scenario,

1134
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:46,150
but he didn't have the wrestling.

1135
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,021
Yeah.

1136
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:50,660
Mark Hunt's was nowhere near
or near the South Bronx.

1137
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,480
So fucking big.

1138
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,320
He's big in a way that even the
chain is big in a different way.

1139
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,173
It just,

1140
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,881
his bizarre,

1141
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:59,460
Brock's even wider than Shane.

1142
00:31:59,650 --> 00:31:59,920
Yeah,

1143
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,280
they built,

1144
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,611
I mean,

1145
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:01,090
when you,

1146
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:04,350
when you cut to me to 65 changes.

1147
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,680
Yeah,

1148
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,100
man,

1149
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,933
what is that?

1150
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:07,901
Yeah.

1151
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:09,120
I mean they're,

1152
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,220
they're still trying to
figure out what Brock was,

1153
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:12,851
you know,

1154
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:13,411
like they're,

1155
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:16,070
they're trying to mount some
sort of a defense there.

1156
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,110
They're coming up with like skin cream
now they're saying if skin cream made him

1157
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:20,944
piss hot

1158
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,400
guys are so hilarious.

1159
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,980
Clomid and fucking skin cream.

1160
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:27,790
I don't know what happened.

1161
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,001
Well.

1162
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:33,001
What's funny is there actually was
some sort of a hormone peptide in um,

1163
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,160
the uh,

1164
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:40,370
the skin cream for psoriasis
that Chad Mendez use.

1165
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,940
Chad Mendez has some pretty serious
psoriasis and there's all these photos of

1166
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:44,091
him.

1167
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:47,540
You could see him ma online whereas
weren't shorts and shit and it's just all

1168
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:48,321
over his legs.

1169
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:50,450
It's real bad and you have to take,

1170
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,500
a lot of times you're taking what is
essentially a steroid cream to try to heal

1171
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:54,770
the,

1172
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,603
the,

1173
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,420
the area.

1174
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,350
And that is what made him test
positive when they found the cream,

1175
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:01,880
they tested the cream and him and Yup,

1176
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,743
sure enough.

1177
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,021
But it's,

1178
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:05,360
so it's a medication
so he has a legitimate,

1179
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,630
I mean he has a real element
you see as the services pension.

1180
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,580
You got this as basic.

1181
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,341
Yeah,

1182
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:11,030
I believe so.

1183
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,570
Yeah,

1184
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,403
I believe so.

1185
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,570
Well you saw it as no fucking joke man,

1186
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:17,450
which is really funny watching all
these guys go over to Bell Tor.

1187
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,430
I think it's going to be a,

1188
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,510
it's going to be interesting.

1189
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:22,310
It's going to be interesting
to see what Bellah toward does.

1190
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:25,370
We're like van underlay and all these
other guys that are going over there and

1191
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:26,280
tails for scale.

1192
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,243
Yeah,

1193
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,391
yeah,

1194
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:30,224
of course.

1195
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:30,981
We'll chill.

1196
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:31,280
Um,

1197
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,830
they said that Charles said that
they're tested them like crazy.

1198
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,030
Right.

1199
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,361
But I mean,

1200
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:37,730
they might be my fucking
son of a text message.

1201
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,661
Hey Yo,

1202
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:40,910
we're testing you like
crazy and three days,

1203
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:41,241
wink,

1204
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:42,074
wink.

1205
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,140
[inaudible]

1206
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,810
Commission.

1207
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,021
Right.

1208
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:45,854
It's not even,

1209
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,910
it's not a new soda.

1210
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,660
No,

1211
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,540
no one's doing it the way the UFC is
doing it and the way UFC is doing it.

1212
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:50,811
I mean,

1213
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:51,750
in a lot of ways it's,

1214
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,690
it's dangerous to their brand,

1215
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,160
you know?

1216
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,381
I mean,

1217
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:55,320
a lot of ways it's,

1218
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,220
a lot of people would say it's
not a good idea financially,

1219
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:00,800
but it just shows their commitment
to trying to clean it up.

1220
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,740
California is doing randoms to now,

1221
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,610
just as the Athletic Commission,

1222
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,000
the Commissioner came here
from Georgia and he's,

1223
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,040
he's wrecking down.

1224
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:09,650
Yeah.

1225
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,483
That's awesome.

1226
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,581
The problem with the,

1227
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:12,830
you saw the thing is that it's,

1228
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,000
if your boss,

1229
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,471
the people that pay,

1230
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,210
you saw that the test is the UFC.

1231
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:17,990
That's,

1232
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,700
I think that's a conflict of interest.

1233
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,070
At some level it should be,

1234
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:22,311
you know,

1235
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:25,190
a state sanctioned or somebody
away from both parties,

1236
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,024
you know,

1237
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,980
because who,

1238
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,250
who,

1239
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:27,510
who,

1240
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,270
who makes the choice on who gets tested?

1241
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,410
Because signing when you told drug
tests and the California for example,

1242
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,910
the California Athletic Commission is
going to contact Bella tour and say you're

1243
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:38,240
fighting.

1244
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,230
This guy is not fighting.

1245
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:40,064
He failed a drug test.

1246
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,150
When you fell a test of the [inaudible],

1247
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,550
they're going to call the UFC McKay.

1248
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:44,851
So,

1249
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:45,500
uh,

1250
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,730
this guy failed the drug test.

1251
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:47,780
What do you want to do about it?

1252
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:48,614
And that's not,

1253
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,700
that becomes a problem.

1254
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:49,911
Yeah.

1255
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:54,510
This guy is called cocaine in his
system and then he fights for,

1256
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,840
we'll just lose those results
till after this main event.

1257
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,111
Yeah.

1258
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,150
But that's different because
it's at a competition.

1259
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,770
There's a certain rules.

1260
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:00,921
Oh,

1261
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:01,754
what happened to him?

1262
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,960
There's certain nuts.

1263
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,460
I thought he's knee buckled.

1264
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:06,740
I thought he got hit with
a push kick to the leg.

1265
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,120
But I think there's,

1266
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:08,840
um,

1267
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,440
there's out of competition testing and
then there's in competition testing and

1268
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:16,070
when you get tested for
something in competition,

1269
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:20,690
it's very different than at a competition
when it comes to recreational drugs.

1270
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,940
But when it comes to
performance enhancing drugs,

1271
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:24,260
like even if it's at a competition,

1272
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:25,520
like save your five weeks out,

1273
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,440
he tests positive for cocaine.

1274
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,720
That's not going to affect your
performance in the ring in a,

1275
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:31,490
in a way that's going
to damage your opponent.

1276
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,280
But if you test positive
for some sort of steroid,

1277
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,190
then it will make sense.

1278
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,550
It kind of makes sense.

1279
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:39,091
It makes sense.

1280
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:40,560
Until you talked to Nick Diaz,

1281
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,350
well that was the most
ridiculous shit that you saw.

1282
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:43,710
No,

1283
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,470
that was in Nevada state
athletic commission.

1284
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,140
Right.

1285
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,820
Not only that you sought and no Wicki
were Novitsky is 100% against it.

1286
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,060
He,

1287
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,410
he thinks it was ridiculous.

1288
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,891
Well,

1289
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:56,250
that same fight and make
filled for that of commission.

1290
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,870
It's been an AP for five years.

1291
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,700
Anderson failed a drug test for steroids
and they had lost his results until

1292
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:03,534
after the fight.

1293
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,570
Look at this knee buckle.

1294
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:05,201
Watch this shit.

1295
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:05,830
Lugging them off.

1296
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,580
Did you see this?

1297
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,360
Did you see that?

1298
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,350
I was knee just buckled it.

1299
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:09,184
That was awful.

1300
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,450
Yeah,

1301
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,230
it was horrible.

1302
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,120
I mean Anderson was doing,

1303
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,631
well,

1304
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:14,710
I don't know if he was doing,

1305
00:36:14,711 --> 00:36:16,330
but he had steroids in a system.

1306
00:36:16,331 --> 00:36:16,571
Right?

1307
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:19,300
For whatever reason he said
it's from Chinese Cialis.

1308
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,370
It was just hilarious.

1309
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,050
He's fucking,

1310
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,520
I would like to see if someone pub,

1311
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,900
someone's should publish a list of
all the excuses fighters have made for

1312
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:29,551
pissing the high.

1313
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:30,384
Are they good?

1314
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,253
Make a t shirt.

1315
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,471
Yeah.

1316
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:33,050
Right.

1317
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,970
Like a tour,

1318
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,430
like a world tour tee shirt of the back.

1319
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:37,780
All the different excuses.

1320
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,620
Sylvia failed for like
winstrol or something and he
said he was doing it just to

1321
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:44,161
get to,

1322
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:47,040
so we have this body would look better
because he was getting so much shit about

1323
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:47,750
looking fat.

1324
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,583
Yeah.

1325
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,430
Well the Tim Silvia that knocked
out Rico Rodriguez was a monster.

1326
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:52,880
Yeah.

1327
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
You going back to that Tim Silvia,

1328
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:56,810
that Tim Silvia was one of the
scariest heavyweights ever.

1329
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,340
I,

1330
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,670
that was when he got pumped.

1331
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,940
I think that was when he goes,

1332
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,340
yeah,

1333
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,700
I remember that fight because I remember
he had a hard time making two 65.

1334
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,580
He had a cut weight to
make to 65 and he wasn't,

1335
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,440
he wasn't fat at all back then.

1336
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,281
I mean,

1337
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:11,114
he was,

1338
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,320
he wasn't shredded.

1339
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,940
But for Tim Silvia,

1340
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,211
I mean,

1341
00:37:14,211 --> 00:37:18,170
he was real lean watching
Tim Silvia walk around.

1342
00:37:18,171 --> 00:37:18,981
He doesn't look like,

1343
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:20,310
like an athlete isn't it looked like he,

1344
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:20,480
she,

1345
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,880
he would have ever been in a
heavyweight champion of the UFC.

1346
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:23,980
But man,

1347
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,740
he had hot,

1348
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,431
oh fuck.

1349
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:25,760
Yeah.

1350
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,181
Well Dude,

1351
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:28,100
I talked to Kelly start about that.

1352
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:28,640
Who's,

1353
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,001
you know,

1354
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:29,271
a,

1355
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:29,720
um,

1356
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,720
a real famous strength and conditioning
coach and knows a lot about physiology

1357
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,601
and he,

1358
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:36,434
and he thinks that,

1359
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,400
oh shit,

1360
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,390
he thinks that,

1361
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,260
um,

1362
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,951
Tim Silvia,

1363
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:42,200
that pigeon toed thing that he did,

1364
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,760
he thinks that's correctable.

1365
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,511
He's like,

1366
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:47,780
you just got to retrain your
body how to walk and stand.

1367
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,790
And for some reason he never did that.

1368
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,420
But start really believes that
like the mechanics of your body,

1369
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:58,421
like you've kind of been cut into a groove
where your body's gotten accustom to

1370
00:37:58,431 --> 00:38:00,140
walking and standing in that way.

1371
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,630
But if you adjusted that and train that,

1372
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:05,120
he would be a way better
athlete and it would move like,

1373
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:05,301
you know,

1374
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:07,970
like a Travis brown or something like
that was a big tall guy who moves.

1375
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:08,804
Great.

1376
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,291
Yeah.

1377
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:10,124
But I mean,

1378
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,150
as a grown man,

1379
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,070
you think he can do retrain.

1380
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,500
I understand you can do,

1381
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,120
but if he wanted to take takes a lot.

1382
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,580
Yeah.

1383
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:16,851
I mean,

1384
00:38:16,851 --> 00:38:17,030
I,

1385
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,930
I listened to Kelly,

1386
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:19,610
I think Kelly knows what
the fuck he's talking about.

1387
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,060
Yeah.

1388
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,080
I don't know if he's right,

1389
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,340
but I mean,

1390
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,470
I would imagine there's something
short of them having some scar

1391
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,830
tissue or whatever that forces him to
walk that way and then you could change

1392
00:38:28,831 --> 00:38:28,981
it.

1393
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:31,110
But I don't think it's likely to grown.

1394
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:32,280
Man has already been successful.

1395
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:32,631
It's gonna be like,

1396
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:32,791
you know,

1397
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,050
I wish I could walk a little less,

1398
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,080
less goofy.

1399
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,010
Let me fix this year.

1400
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:36,431
Yeah.

1401
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:36,731
I mean,

1402
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,020
I don't know what makes you walk.

1403
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:38,890
Pigeon toed.

1404
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,550
Jamie,

1405
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,240
pull that up.

1406
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,060
Tim Silvia goes and
fixes walk in next year.

1407
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:43,871
We see him in the NFL.

1408
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:44,650
Yeah.

1409
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,670
Well I don't know about all that.

1410
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,141
The last thing,

1411
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,420
I think that dude needs to
get him to that anymore.

1412
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:49,870
Yeah.

1413
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,010
That ray Mercer fight.

1414
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,550
Uh,

1415
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,000
that was,

1416
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,930
that was the end of the wall.

1417
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:53,380
That,

1418
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,320
that was a nice

1419
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,431
kick in there.

1420
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:57,264
It didn't matter.

1421
00:38:59,660 --> 00:38:59,811
Oh,

1422
00:38:59,811 --> 00:39:02,150
we should probably say
we're watching round three.

1423
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:07,510
It's 27262520420 two seconds to go in.

1424
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:10,740
Does it?

1425
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,200
Explaining what causes it.

1426
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,190
What causes pigeon toe pigeon toes
caused by one of three conditions.

1427
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,390
Metasys,

1428
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:21,830
serous Matar Sus Metta,

1429
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,390
Metta Tarsus,

1430
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:25,760
metatarsus Adductus,

1431
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,260
tibial torsion or femoral anteversion.

1432
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,410
Each condition is
specific to its location.

1433
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:34,970
Here's a brief description of each.

1434
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:39,971
The foot pigeon toes occur when the
foot tends to resemble a kidney awe.

1435
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:45,910
Or when a metatarsus adductus
has an inward curve at the
outer edge of the foot.

1436
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:50,540
If your child has this condition,

1437
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:53,720
you'll probably notice it while
your child is still a baby.

1438
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:57,050
Sometimes the doctor will try braces or
special shoes while the child is still a

1439
00:39:57,051 --> 00:39:57,884
baby.

1440
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,030
Six to nine months old.

1441
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,700
Help you manipulate the
bones into growing straight.

1442
00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:04,610
The condition will not
clear up on its own.

1443
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,300
Metatarsus adductus requires treatment.

1444
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,750
The nature of which varies depending
upon whether the condition is flexible or

1445
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:12,500
fixed.

1446
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,080
Most flexible cases respond
to conservative treatment,

1447
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,120
which indicates passive stretching,

1448
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:19,100
bracing and specialized shoes.

1449
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,880
The fixed type requires
serial plaster casting.

1450
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,400
If conservative treatment does not help,

1451
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:29,870
then reevaluation as in order to make
sure the patient does not have true club

1452
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:31,820
foot instead of metatarsus.

1453
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,713
Adductus.

1454
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,913
Huh?

1455
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,413
Interesting.

1456
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,560
I just,

1457
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,490
right now I'm just,

1458
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,900
I like looking behind the veil,

1459
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:39,734
man.

1460
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,430
There are times when when I'm
listening to you about gas and,

1461
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:42,861
and you're,

1462
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:43,694
you're,

1463
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,190
you go into one of those and I'm like,

1464
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,210
is he like,

1465
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,961
what is he doing?

1466
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:48,890
Where's that coming from?

1467
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,130
Oh,

1468
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:49,760
now I know.

1469
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,480
Now I know.

1470
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,380
See how it works.

1471
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:52,214
It's called the Internet.

1472
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,073
It's like magic.

1473
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:53,930
Yeah,

1474
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,870
but Google is,

1475
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,290
you're asking someone else can do it.

1476
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm like,

1477
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,180
how are you asking someone else to do it?

1478
00:40:59,181 --> 00:41:00,050
And then you're reading it.

1479
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,891
Oh there you go.

1480
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:01,400
Get it.

1481
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:01,940
Get it.

1482
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,630
Get it.

1483
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,950
I'm not going to give away the secret.

1484
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:04,784
I just get it.

1485
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,110
Poffle Duane Ludwig with Whitney Mann.

1486
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,953
Whitney Miller.

1487
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,850
Know that I love Duane man.

1488
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:11,600
He's a good dude.

1489
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,433
He's a wizard.

1490
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,420
That guy is a striking wizard.

1491
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,760
He broke my orbital daddy.

1492
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,450
Yeah,

1493
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,350
that's not very nice.

1494
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,560
So what did he hit you with?

1495
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,290
A fun.

1496
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,490
I was in his guard.

1497
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,211
I'm on top,

1498
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:25,100
I mean as a guard and he throws a punch.

1499
00:41:25,101 --> 00:41:25,970
He throws it this way.

1500
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So he turns his knuckles over and like
casting style and all the knuckle hit me

1501
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:32,690
right in the eyeball.

1502
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,070
I'm on top of him and I'm

1503
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,460
like throwing shots and then he throws
that punch and he hits me and I put my

1504
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,500
head down on his belly
and hold on his biceps.

1505
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:39,741
I'm like,

1506
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:40,880
fuck that hurt.

1507
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,170
That really hurt.

1508
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,120
Like that was one of
those moments in a fight.

1509
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:48,170
Whereas like that hurt and I couldn't
see straight for the rest of that was the

1510
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:50,720
first round from the
bottom here on the bottom.

1511
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,920
He was losing his guard.

1512
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:52,521
Close guard.

1513
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:52,880
He threw it.

1514
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,970
That punch hit me right now.

1515
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:54,980
Eyeball since that

1516
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,091
doctor said,

1517
00:41:59,091 --> 00:41:59,860
doctor said,

1518
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,200
um,

1519
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,040
two things happen.

1520
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:04,760
Either the eyeball ruptures or you're
fracturing to relieve the pressure.

1521
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:05,594
So I got lucky,

1522
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,130
my brother in law,

1523
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,063
my brother in law,

1524
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,010
Aaron who was uh,

1525
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,980
these like mid thirties,

1526
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:11,814
he uh,

1527
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,381
as a,

1528
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:13,214
uh,

1529
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,300
it'd be late thirties.

1530
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,410
Oh that's fucked.

1531
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,783
You see that?

1532
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,560
I fucking hate nasty.

1533
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,430
Why would you even do that?

1534
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:20,961
I hate that.

1535
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:21,261
Anyway,

1536
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:23,120
he's a pitcher like a pickup league,

1537
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:25,740
like a just for fun leagues,

1538
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,330
uh,

1539
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,200
playing baseball for a long time and he
throws a pitch and then it gets hit line

1540
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,170
line drive right back at him
on a fucking Sunday afternoon.

1541
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:34,190
Hit Him Square in the eye.

1542
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,270
Like ruptures is,

1543
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:36,830
I lost his eyes,

1544
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:38,060
had like 10 surgeries,

1545
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,830
losses eyeball his eyeball now
they're like talking to me.

1546
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,250
We might be able to keep the eye with
like filling in cause it opened in the

1547
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:50,030
back like a flap and like all the shit
leaked out and then they had to fill it

1548
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,880
with this oil and they're trying to hope
that they can at least save the eye.

1549
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:53,780
But the Vision's gone.

1550
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,003
Ah,

1551
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,150
awful.

1552
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,050
Jesus Christ and like for
like basketball for fun,

1553
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:01,130
like a fun game.

1554
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:01,971
I'm a fucking,

1555
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:03,260
Sunday is terrible.

1556
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,010
Terrible.

1557
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,610
Yeah man.

1558
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,443
Fuck that.

1559
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,270
Fuck that kick to you.

1560
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:10,870
Don't like that kick to kick to the thigh.

1561
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,271
It's cool.

1562
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:13,820
But when you're trying to
extend the guy's knee like that,

1563
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:16,790
I think it's shit illegal
in glory and well,

1564
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:18,650
I mean it really depends
on where he's hitting him.

1565
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,360
It's,

1566
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,130
it's such a weird thing
because if your leg is,

1567
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,600
if you know your leg is slightly bent
and the guy catches you above the thigh

1568
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:27,440
with that push kick,

1569
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,350
it's going to extend your
leg and it's going to hurt.

1570
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,443
There's not,

1571
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,930
I mean the way he did it,

1572
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:34,930
that was really nasty.

1573
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,710
I mean that was one of
the worst ones I've seen.

1574
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,370
Did you ever see that one with
Miguel Torres who I sit and when I,

1575
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,260
for the first time I was on your podcast,

1576
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,510
it was awful.

1577
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,490
But that every time I see it as bugs me,

1578
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:49,400
I had a knee surgery and we were talking
earlier about how long it takes you to

1579
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,410
come back mentally forever.

1580
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:55,340
And I was out for a year
from an ACL and MCL tear.

1581
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,280
But like in that last three months,

1582
00:43:58,281 --> 00:43:59,390
especially that last camp,

1583
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:00,560
getting back into the ring,

1584
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:05,120
like every time you feel like any kind
of twist or pop or any scar tissue that

1585
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:05,511
breaks,

1586
00:44:05,511 --> 00:44:08,120
like you just freak out and
you make like a girly noise.

1587
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:08,720
Like ever.

1588
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,740
I was a fucking spider.

1589
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:11,750
Ran Across the room and uh,

1590
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:11,961
yeah,

1591
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:12,770
it was really hard.

1592
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,170
So every time I see any kind
of shit like that on the knee,

1593
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,830
it bugs me.

1594
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:16,011
Yeah.

1595
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:18,600
That's why people are so
terrified of heel hooks,

1596
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,310
you know,

1597
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:19,801
he'll hook,

1598
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:21,980
scare people more than
anything because with,

1599
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:26,900
with the difference between tapping and
not tapping quick enough is you being

1600
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:27,740
crippled for a year

1601
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,103
and yeah,

1602
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,213
super effective.

1603
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,770
But that's why a guy like who
smaller Paul Horace is so hated,

1604
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,870
like he's the one,

1605
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,090
one of the most hated guys and the history
of the sport because he holds on the

1606
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,953
heel hooks.

1607
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:40,801
Those are,

1608
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:41,640
those are the two.

1609
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,080
Those are the two guys that I hate.

1610
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:43,950
This shit.

1611
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,810
The flashy dancers and the heel hooker.

1612
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,270
This shit is going to be crazy.

1613
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,200
He Kovar Hoeven and bought her heart.

1614
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:50,180
You seem bottled lately.

1615
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,000
Oh my God.

1616
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,720
It looks like he's on all
the steroids for sure.

1617
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,600
All the start for sure.

1618
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,781
For sure.

1619
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:58,614
For sure.

1620
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,483
He's so much

1621
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,290
more.

1622
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:02,910
I want to watch.

1623
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,120
Oh,

1624
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,900
it's going to look it up.

1625
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,860
Look at him in that picture.

1626
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,401
Oh Man.

1627
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:07,170
Look at that fucking
picture from his Instagram.

1628
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,310
Holy Shit.

1629
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,980
He looks like he gained
1520 pounds of muscle.

1630
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,510
I mean you look at like his last fight.

1631
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:14,190
He did not look like that at all.

1632
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:14,730
Well,

1633
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,080
what I love about this fight to,

1634
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:16,681
it's first of all,

1635
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,380
Rico's in his fucking prime but bought,

1636
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:21,930
has been training for
this fight for six months.

1637
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,520
Like he's been putting it up on his
Instagram and he hasn't fought in forever.

1638
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:27,961
Look at this.

1639
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:29,790
When he was fighting with
Shin Protection and head gear,

1640
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:30,990
I was already a household name,

1641
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,340
so it doesn't matter.

1642
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:32,880
Rico,

1643
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,180
you cannot deny Rico Verhoeven
is a bad motherfucker.

1644
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:36,901
I mean,

1645
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,901
he is so high level right now and his
endurance and pace and athleticism for a

1646
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:44,040
heavyweight is really rare.

1647
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,630
He's something special.

1648
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,610
He's super athletic and he said Jari at
dude and like he's a fucking giant dude,

1649
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,430
so's Bhattar and bothers us.

1650
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,070
Have Ej like just a straight
getting like super excited.

1651
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,261
Really.

1652
00:45:58,261 --> 00:45:58,501
Shit.

1653
00:45:58,501 --> 00:45:59,230
I'm fucking,

1654
00:45:59,230 --> 00:45:59,401
yeah,

1655
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:00,570
we got to do one for that.

1656
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,423
Right?

1657
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,230
Let's do one more juiced up.

1658
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:03,931
He gets the more,

1659
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:04,201
I'm like,

1660
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:04,681
fuck yeah,

1661
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:05,514
I can't wait

1662
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,050
because I thought I was a
little worried that you know,

1663
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:12,030
Rico is in his prime and butter hasn't
fought in a while and his last fight

1664
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:12,864
didn't look that great.

1665
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,700
Oh God damn it all big.

1666
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,031
I'm like,

1667
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:15,660
fuck.

1668
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,030
That's the same night
as the UFC in Toronto.

1669
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,983
Cancel it.

1670
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,890
I should.

1671
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,940
I'm thinking of it now.

1672
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:21,991
I thought,

1673
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:22,261
Joe,

1674
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:22,981
we talked about this.

1675
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:23,701
You're only going to do,

1676
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:25,920
you have seized when it's in
Vegas and close to home for you.

1677
00:46:25,921 --> 00:46:26,161
Right.

1678
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,140
You're not going to go
out of the North America,

1679
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,733
Canada,

1680
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:33,900
Canada's North America.

1681
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,160
There are there a sort of America go
commit a misdemeanor and you won't be able

1682
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:38,431
to go.

1683
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:39,870
It won't be here for one of our friends.

1684
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:41,183
There are people.

1685
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,690
Hmm.

1686
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,350
There's going to be
really good about this.

1687
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,720
Really thinking about cans,

1688
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,250
the UFC to watch that fight.

1689
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,093
How fucked up.

1690
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,790
I don't feel like calling the UFC.

1691
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,421
Hey Brian.

1692
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:51,781
Stan,

1693
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:52,614
what's up dude?

1694
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,290
What'd you do in December 10th do it,

1695
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,590
man.

1696
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,180
I was December 10th yeah,

1697
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:01,130
my flight's at Simberi.

1698
00:47:01,131 --> 00:47:01,801
10th Oh,

1699
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:02,011
well.

1700
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:04,250
What am I going buy or you want to know?

1701
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,760
Beltour I'm canceling the fight.

1702
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:06,420
Fuck it.

1703
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,253
Yeah.

1704
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,151
That's crazy.

1705
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:11,610
That Bella tours doing that
on the same night as Gloria.

1706
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:12,960
It's a UFC

1707
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,500
fight in Italy for ability
or they're doing like,

1708
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:17,220
uh,

1709
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:17,601
I think it's,

1710
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:18,000
it's,

1711
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,500
it's three events or two events.

1712
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,210
Is it going to be belted toward
kickboxing or is it Bella?

1713
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,710
Tour and billets were
kickbox so they'd combine it.

1714
00:47:25,711 --> 00:47:28,740
So like one kickboxing fied
one like shockwave did or,

1715
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,650
yeah,

1716
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,483
I believe so.

1717
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,070
You got to find a time where you
going to fight for the U s time?

1718
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,660
I think they're actually going to,

1719
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:36,700
I think they play it a week later.

1720
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,270
TV time or for the last time.

1721
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,330
Well,

1722
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,350
so you'll be able to watch it.

1723
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:41,561
Yeah,

1724
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:42,670
because you'll fight.

1725
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,240
It will be morning here early in
the morning when you're fighting.

1726
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:47,763
Probably

1727
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,210
it's my buddy Casey green and he's up
and my sparring part in the last like

1728
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,250
three or four fights is
really a good dude out of it.

1729
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,163
He taller than you,

1730
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:56,970
this guy?

1731
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:57,350
Yeah.

1732
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,183
No,

1733
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,500
I think I have about an inch on him.

1734
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,130
He's gotten a lot better over the
last 10 years and he works so hard.

1735
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:04,151
Work so hard.

1736
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,320
He's like real consistent.

1737
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,890
My really excited that this Kevin Tough
fighter on his hands lists Thai guy.

1738
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:09,321
He's fighting.

1739
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:10,750
He's got like 170 fights.

1740
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:11,943
God,

1741
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:16,330
that's so crazy cases out
of Saxons in Van Nuys.

1742
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,163
Right?

1743
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,760
Bama said he been,

1744
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:20,320
I'm coming up to train with you.

1745
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:20,631
Yeah.

1746
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,150
Obama's been fucking buy.

1747
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:22,421
Yeah.

1748
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:23,230
You should come through.

1749
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:23,681
We've been,

1750
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:24,180
uh,

1751
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:24,340
my,

1752
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,490
my coach has been torturing us,

1753
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,010
but we're getting some
really good working.

1754
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:27,370
Well,

1755
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,270
I'm just a real cool cut.

1756
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:28,581
Yeah.

1757
00:48:28,581 --> 00:48:30,840
I like who's Bomba Mamba.

1758
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:31,870
He was on,

1759
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:32,641
he was a kid on,

1760
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:32,791
on,

1761
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:33,880
on sales team.

1762
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:34,900
On the ultimate fighter Brazil.

1763
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,141
Oh,

1764
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:35,890
okay.

1765
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:38,290
I guess we were like lived with
chill or lived up to the up there.

1766
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,880
We're chill.

1767
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,110
Was good for a banking
partner for a long time.

1768
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:46,000
Now he's hearing Chell such character
like oh world world champions you Jitsu

1769
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:46,450
guy.

1770
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:46,871
And he was like,

1771
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:46,951
Oh,

1772
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:48,070
I'm gonna work on my kickboxing.

1773
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:48,281
I'm like,

1774
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:48,461
cool.

1775
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:49,300
And we started shooting drills.

1776
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:49,461
I'm like,

1777
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:54,461
this is mother fuckers could the fuck
this tie kid is 20 years old and he has a

1778
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,710
hundred and what fights 170
160 is fucking incredible.

1779
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,130
Right.

1780
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,150
That's insane.

1781
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:02,560
The first tie tape,

1782
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:04,330
I have a watch from a
friend from Thailand.

1783
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,220
They had like two 17 year olds.

1784
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:07,750
They had like a hundred
and something fights.

1785
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,530
Well in Thailand you're prime is like 16,

1786
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:11,951
17,

1787
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:12,784
18.

1788
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,061
You know,

1789
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:13,421
if you're,

1790
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:14,710
if you're 23 years old,

1791
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:16,030
you're like over the hill,

1792
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,110
like you're fucking getting older.

1793
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,370
What about a guy like Sam Chai was 36
even Sanchez like I don't think he's like

1794
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,350
maybe Sanchez still is,

1795
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:27,430
but for the most part those guys
that like sand shy or blue collar,

1796
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,761
whatever,

1797
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:30,430
those guys aren't even like
the prime in Thailand anymore.

1798
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:33,880
They're gotten so old and so big and now
they fight the forerunners everywhere.

1799
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:39,520
That's what you were saying like top
level and Thailand has like 113 pounds.

1800
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,170
16 powered

1801
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,560
one 34 wins.

1802
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:46,150
32 losses,

1803
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:51,100
zero draws with 45 K I was dye
is incredible at 20 years old.

1804
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,010
I have a lot of fights that
he has as many Kaos is,

1805
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:55,120
I have fighter right?

1806
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:58,720
That phrase saying that's an end.

1807
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:01,480
He's 20 that's crazy.

1808
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:06,760
That means he was born
in 1996 that's insane.

1809
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,410
So when he was born,

1810
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:09,491
I don't know,

1811
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:13,540
but I'm assuming it was when he was like
probably like eight years old or five

1812
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:14,350
years old.

1813
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,410
His parents like put,

1814
00:50:15,411 --> 00:50:18,820
took come to a Muy Thai camp
and that camp probably took,

1815
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,120
raised him and sent him
to school or whatnot.

1816
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:23,200
And then every day after school,

1817
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:24,550
since he was like five years old,

1818
00:50:24,551 --> 00:50:25,970
he fucking train moy cage.

1819
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,190
Casey's regular weekends,

1820
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:27,921
five wins,

1821
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:28,190
six

1822
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,023
losses,

1823
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,333
two knockouts.

1824
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,403
Crazy.

1825
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:34,601
Boy,

1826
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:35,960
that's a big step up for him.

1827
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:36,794
Yeah.

1828
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,430
He's got a lot of,

1829
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,810
he got the size advantage for sure.

1830
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:39,291
And this one.

1831
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,011
And then he also,

1832
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:40,490
um,

1833
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,800
usually those ties when
they come over and they do,

1834
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:45,920
or when they switch over to kickboxing
there first time they don't do that well

1835
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:47,000
because it's so different.

1836
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,890
This live rule set and stuff.

1837
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,810
How good are the tie fighters when
they started getting bigger and heavier

1838
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:54,644
weight?

1839
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,240
This is one 70.

1840
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:56,960
Right.

1841
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,080
That's big for a title.

1842
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,430
Yeah.

1843
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,263
And he's not,

1844
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,223
he's probably,

1845
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,243
you know,

1846
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:01,851
eight.

1847
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:02,880
He didn't cut an ounce,

1848
00:51:02,881 --> 00:51:03,031
you know,

1849
00:51:03,031 --> 00:51:05,220
you'd probably over eight and
waiting with his keys on it,

1850
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,073
make 70,

1851
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,290
which is like a normal thing,

1852
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,153
you know?

1853
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:09,971
Yeah.

1854
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:11,020
He weighed one 69.

1855
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,391
But yeah,

1856
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:12,620
they're just not that big of people.

1857
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,940
It's like even book out is just not
too many guys that book house size.

1858
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:21,290
We see guys that were like used to be
150 pounds and then they just got super

1859
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,010
fat and other fight and the one
85 but they have a hundred fights.

1860
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:24,920
Even Super Fat,

1861
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:25,521
that dangerous,

1862
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:26,354
you know.

1863
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:27,750
How do you say his name?

1864
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,980
Sit songs.

1865
00:51:28,981 --> 00:51:29,814
Sit Song.

1866
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:34,130

so the and Thailand.

1868
00:51:35,661 --> 00:51:36,590

1869
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,330
their last names are the,

1870
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,750
usually the gym named that they
represent like the Brazilians,

1871
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:46,550
except except the Brazilians are kind
of just pick their name like Lisa and

1875
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,493
Nah,

1876
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,130

1887
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,261
Are you serious?

1888
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:04,100
He's dropping it.

1889
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:05,930
This is the exclusive right here.

1890
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,790

Shut the fuck up man.

when they come in,

1896
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:16,220
they change their visa,

1897
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:16,780
their name,

1898
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,000
their,

1899
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,060
their visa or whatever
into the u s they make,

1900
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,080
they choose their own names.

1901
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,450
I don't know if that's
legal even because look,

1902
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,790
next time you travel,

1903
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,380
look at the list.

1904
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,611
If you look at the list,

1905
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:29,900
you could see the guy's real name.

1906
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,493

1909
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:41,330
right kick man.

1910
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:41,721
He,

1911
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:43,280
when he slams it into the forearm,

1912
00:52:43,281 --> 00:52:45,950
you could see Casey just reacting to it.

1913
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:48,440
Good.

1914
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,560
Overhand right too.

1915
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:54,470
You see Tiago down to 155 pounds now.

1916
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,170
Yeah.

1917

00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,270
He looks great.

1922
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,313
He looks good.

1923
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,170
Such a much better wait for him.

1924
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,610
I bet he's going to be a killer at one

1940
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:32,343

Shoreman I think I didn't
really enjoy Vinny.

1960
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,180
I think Vinnie's really good.

1961
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,051
He knows his shit,

1962
00:54:08,051 --> 00:54:08,884
that's for sure.

1963
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,053
Absolutely.

1964
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,273
Um,

1965
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,570
it's hard finding really good guides.

1966
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:14,381

or now he's hurt.

1980
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,773
They call it a slip.

1981
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,271
Yeah.

1982
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:29,140
They call it a thrill.

1983
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,370
That is not slip.

1984
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,750
He was cracked.

1985
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,080

He got,

1989
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:44,680
come on son.

1990
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,670
He's hurt there.

1991
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,030
Well,

1992
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,270
we can't go out and knock down though.

1993
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:49,061
You can't really call him.

1994
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:50,540
Knocked down through
another shot after it.

1995
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:50,680
Right?

1996
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:50,951
Yeah.

1997
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:51,251
I mean,

1998
00:54:51,251 --> 00:54:52,270
there was a lot of slipping.

1999
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:52,750
Yeah,

2000
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,280
he did fall down from a slip.

2001
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:54,701
Good job.

2002
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:55,534
Breath.

2003
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,220
I America go America.

2004
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,211
Go Mark.

2005
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:58,551
All good.

2006
00:54:58,551 --> 00:54:58,760
Good.

2007
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,560
Got Good to get it.

2008
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,393
Give it to him.

2009
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:01,780
Mark.

2010
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,613
Casey,

2011
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:07,683
is it hard?

2012
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,201
Okay,

2013
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:10,150
so in a Moyie Thai fight,

2014
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,771
kickboxing fight,

2015
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:12,604
like in glory,

2016
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:13,870
when you watch him remain,

2017
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:17,560
you guys getting beaten on his feet and
your teammates getting beaten on his

2018
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:17,771
feet,

2019
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:18,041
you're like,

2020
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:18,970
you have to take down you.

2021
00:55:18,971 --> 00:55:20,590
You figure like there's another way.

2022
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:22,810
When you guys getting beat up
on their feet and Muay Thai,

2023
00:55:22,811 --> 00:55:23,111
what do you,

2024
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:23,940
what are you thinking?

2025
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,773
Yeah,

2026
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,150
cause there's no other way.

2027
00:55:26,151 --> 00:55:26,361
Yeah.

2028
00:55:26,361 --> 00:55:26,860
This is,

2029
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,700
we've got a big shot.

2030
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,800
We've got to change something here.

2031
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,230
Oh,

2032
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,790
I like to see Casey start musing.

2033
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:32,810
This movement stopped being,

2034
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,670
don't be so predictable for that.

2035
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:35,901
Stand in front of you.

2036
00:55:35,901 --> 00:55:36,734
Thai style.

2037
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,603
Yeah.

2038
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,670
Well there's also sees chart needs
to be like more American right now.

2039
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,530
Not trying to fight him
and wait Thai style.

2040
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,990
I guess this guy because it's
just too much experience.

2041
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:49,970
Do you think that guys automatically
s try to fight the style of the ties?

2042
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:50,804
Because,

2043
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:51,081
I mean,

2044
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,370
that's what they idolize,

2045
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:52,731
right?

2046
00:55:52,731 --> 00:55:54,760
I mean like everybody
who's a Moy Thai fighter,

2047
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:55,040
they,

2048
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:55,400
they,

2049
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,870
they idolize the greats.

2050
00:55:56,871 --> 00:55:57,111
You know,

2051
00:55:57,111 --> 00:56:02,111
they idolize these high level guys and
then they wind up fighting on Monday.

2052
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:04,721
Yeah.

2053
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:06,490
I don't think it's intentional per se,

2054
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:07,630
but I think you ended up doing that.

2055
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:08,880
Or um,

2056
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,490
we should just watch a bunch
of Ramon Dekkers fights.

2057
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,063
Yup.

2058
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,150
What's going on sir?

2059
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,840
Cut.

2060
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,170
No,

2061
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,520
Casey was complaining about it,

2062
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:23,560
about clenching and kneeing the
time and the referee stopped it,

2063
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:24,010
but he didn't

2064
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,400
stop.

2065
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,360
The Thai guy didn't stop.

2066
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:26,643
Okay.

2067
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:28,460
He doesn't know what the fuck is.

2068
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,323
No,

2069
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,390
he's here in bar.

2070
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:35,873
Yeah,

2071
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,073
yeah,

2072
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,213
yeah.

2073
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,483
I winning.

2074
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:40,131
Yeah.

2075
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:40,301
Yeah,

2076
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:41,134
yeah.

2077
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,160
Let me keep fight.

2078
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,530
I think it's a boy.

2079
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,570
You were asking do I think it's kind
of like the Wonderboy thing too.

2080
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:48,404
Like when you,

2081
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:49,550
when you're in that moment,

2082
00:56:49,551 --> 00:56:50,690
you don't realize that you're,

2083
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,180
you're kind of playing the
other guy's game sometime.

2084
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:53,920
Chin.

2085
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,753
Yeah.

2086
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,273
Okay.

2087
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:00,690
There's a thing that you see
with guys like sit song peanuts.

2088
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:02,830
When you see guys that have been doing it,

2089
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:04,090
their whole live with it,

2090
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,390
their,

2091
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,980
their triggers so fast.

2092
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:07,180
Like the way he throws that,

2093
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,500
that kick that let's switch kick through
just through and the way he throws.

2094
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,250
It's like they have,

2095
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:17,310
they have such fluidity because their
technique is so a part of like who they

2096
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:20,140
are and how they develop
as a human like yeah,

2097
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:21,910
just throw that right kick to the arms.

2098
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:22,871
It's like,

2099
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:26,710
it becomes like a part of how they move.

2100
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,300
I mean he's probably been moving,

2101
00:57:28,301 --> 00:57:31,570
throwing kicks and punches and
avoiding them and and clenching.

2102
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:32,201
He just did it again.

2103
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:33,820
He just clinched him and
hit him in the knee there.

2104
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,950
I mean he's been doing
that since he was a baby.

2105
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,580
Yeah.

2106
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,170
It's just the,

2107
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,120
that I that fight,

2108
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:44,490
it's just so much to fight Iq and
also the efficiency of the movement.

2109
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:49,660
You Watch Casey and I seen some
of his other fights and he fights,

2110
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,640
usually fights at a much longer range.

2111
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:53,410
He's like really close to this dude.

2112
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,510
He's so punished already.

2113
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:57,901
You know?

2114
00:57:57,901 --> 00:58:00,360
That's part of the problem with
deep into the second round,

2115
00:58:00,361 --> 00:58:02,280
he's just been beaten up so much.

2116
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,120
And the last thing you want to do with
the tie with that much experience as the

2117
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,740
clenches and Gloria Roosevelt's
was a clinch anyway,

2118
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:10,290
but like that's what
you ends up happening.

2119
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:10,710
You know,

2120
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,660
for some reason you keep
doing the same thing.

2121
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,441
But yeah.

2122
00:58:13,441 --> 00:58:16,860
Casey usually has a really a lot better
movement and I'm moving side to side,

2123
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:20,160
but I think he's getting flustered here
or maybe he's looking for the big shot.

2124
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,613
It's not coming.

2125
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,070
Get aggressive with,

2126
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,290
did he hurt his knee?

2127
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,070
Fuck was that,

2128
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,090
did he hurt his knee there?

2129
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:31,800
I'm sure Simon Mind,

2130
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,290
like his leg just gave out.

2131
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:34,970
He's still wobbly.

2132
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:37,281
What does that from,

2133
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:38,990
was that from a punch and then see it?

2134
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:39,171
Oh,

2135
00:58:39,171 --> 00:58:39,890
he's fucked.

2136
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,720
He's still fuck Bullock
he's trying to move.

2137
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:42,100
Yeah.

2138
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,933
Uh,

2139
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,370
fuck.

2140
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:44,210
I should have stopped it.

2141
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:46,730
Oh,

2142
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:47,740
he just got stunned.

2143
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:48,581
Oh,

2144
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:49,330
he's hurt.

2145
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:49,930
He's hurt.

2146
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:50,211
I said,

2147
00:58:50,211 --> 00:58:51,650
it seems like he's not just fun.

2148
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,553
Yeah,

2149
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,081
come on.

2150
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:54,240
He's got something wrong while drive.

2151
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:54,761
Come on.

2152
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:55,340
Right.

2153
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:55,630
Ooh,

2154
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:56,620
his leg went backwards.

2155
00:58:56,621 --> 00:58:57,610
The long ref.

2156
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,533
Yeah,

2157
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,590
the reference top it.

2158
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:01,763
No.

2159
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:03,390
Oh Man.

2160
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:03,571
Yeah,

2161
00:59:03,571 --> 00:59:04,580
he's his leg.

2162
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,103
Oh.

2163
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:06,721
Oh.

2164
00:59:06,721 --> 00:59:07,890
He's too tough for his own good.

2165
00:59:07,891 --> 00:59:09,120
He's got 10 seconds left around.

2166
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,080
The referee stopped the fight.

2167
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,040
Oh Shit.

2168
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:12,470
Right before he got k owed.

2169
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,040
Ooh.

2170
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:18,211
Yeah.

2171
00:59:18,211 --> 00:59:18,931
When a guy,

2172
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:23,570
is that hindered by something you've
got to kind of stop the fight.

2173
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,220
What happened with his leg?

2174
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,260
I'm sure they're going to show us,

2175
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,740
but that was one of the
weirdest way he went down.

2176
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,161
Yeah,

2177
00:59:31,161 --> 00:59:34,460
and also the way like he was trying to
get up and it would just wasn't working.

2178
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,420
It was like his ACL at
blown out or something.

2179
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,200
It's like when you,

2180
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,561
when you,

2181
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:42,410
when you just kind of tease
the cockroach or bug spray

2182
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,043
black.

2183
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,890
I grew up in The Bahamas.

2184
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:48,733
Mad.

2185
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,530
What the fuck?

2186
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,760
We're all like [inaudible] I do that

2187
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:57,650
here.

2188
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:58,483
Let's see it here.

2189
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,091
Okay.

2190
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:00,260
You hit him on the right hand.

2191
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,543
Is that it?

2192
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:07,523
Hmm.

2193
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,503
That's weird.

2194
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:08,960
Oh,

2195
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,360
I see.

2196
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,220
I was a left hook.

2197
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:10,431
No,

2198
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:10,910
that's the,

2199
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,320
that's the left hook is the end.

2200
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:13,100
Well what,

2201
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,900
what made him wobble like that?

2202
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:15,291
No,

2203
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:16,940
that's the very end of the fight.

2204
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,290
He was already hurt,

2205
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,020
but he already had a problem
with his leg was great.

2206
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:21,320
Camera.

2207
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,030
I want to know this is terrible.

2208
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:23,864
Replace.

2209
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,351
I would,

2210
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:25,850
if I would be asking the truck,

2211
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:26,930
I want to know what happened.

2212
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:27,590
Did he,

2213
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,550
was it a punch?

2214
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:30,170
Was it an elbow?

2215
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:33,920
Like what caused him to go down the
first time and why was he so wobbly?

2216
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:38,090
Was it because he got hurt or
was it because of a knee injury?

2217
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:40,371
Man,

2218
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:41,360
why don't they show that?

2219
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,561
Get on it.

2220
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:43,394
Glory.

2221
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,560
Is it like 12 year old doctor right there?

2222
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,480
Is that,

2223
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:46,610
yeah.

2224
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,700
You gotta be 14 to be a
Doogie Howser right there.

2225
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,183
Holding onto him.

2226
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:52,610
Dude.

2227
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:53,061
Fuck.

2228
01:00:53,061 --> 01:00:53,871
Showing us this.

2229
01:00:53,871 --> 01:00:55,260
Show us what happened in the past.

2230
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,120
I don't know why they're
not showing that this is,

2231
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,550
this is a very strange,

2232
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,400
don't they broadcast this overseas also?

2233
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:02,510
It's probably commercial time.

2234
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,970
I think you're exactly right.

2235
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,953
Yeah.

2236
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,990
How the fuck is this not on regular TV?

2237
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,040
It's so exciting.

2238
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:16,490
I mean the in the depth of talent look
sits on peanut and it's 20 years old.

2239
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,890
How many of these dudes
are out there and there?

2240
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:19,970
Is there a hundreds?

2241
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:20,850
You know,

2242
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:21,650
it was a lot.

2243
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:21,951
Yeah.

2244
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:25,550
The depth of talent and kickboxing
is off the fucking charts

2245
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,670
and uh,

2246
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,760
isn't mal pet fighting
Kyle home back tonight?

2247
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,400
I heard that a Kai.

2248
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:36,020
I got hurt and they pull
it out of the fight.

2249
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:36,854
I heard it.

2250
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:38,570
I tried texting him but I haven't heard,

2251
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:41,570
but I heard him when the
loan is neon this recently,

2252
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,470
this week maybe.

2253
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,510
Oh my God.

2254
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,360
That reached out to her.

2255
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,440
Do you know how many
fights mallet that has?

2256
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,320
Some are 200 to 800.

2257
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,190
That's crazy.

2258
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:53,151
Yeah,

2259
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:53,391
it's,

2260
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:54,350
it is amazing.

2261
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,840
It's amazing.

2262
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,690
Um,

2263
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:58,811
you know,

2264
01:01:58,811 --> 01:01:59,644
he has a brother.

2265
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,000
Who else is on the,

2266
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:02,480
um,

2267
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,590
the lion fight card.

2268
01:02:03,591 --> 01:02:06,500
Did they cancel the whole card
or they just can't the main fire,

2269
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:06,980
the main of it,

2270
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,670
I think now,

2271
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:08,503
uh,

2272
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,820
mellow feds fighting Joe Joe something.

2273
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,090
Joe Not Ofwat.

2274
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:15,470
Yeah.

2275
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,430
Holy Shit.

2276
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,950
That's a better fight
or a really good fight.

2277
01:02:18,951 --> 01:02:20,160
At least it's a really good fight.

2278
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:20,821
And then the,

2279
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:21,510
uh,

2280
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:24,690
my buddy wrote me a is
fighting on that card as well.

2281
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:28,590
Who's modeling lion fight
has some outstanding talent.

2282
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,520
They really do.

2283
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:29,731
Yeah.

2284
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:33,180
There's a California and
in the u s in general,

2285
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:33,721
there's a lot of,

2286
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:34,554
uh,

2287
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:38,550
there's a lot of really good Manito more
so probably than kickboxing because,

2288
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,010
cause there's so many Moitai
gyms here in Los Angeles.

2289
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:41,880
Yeah,

2290
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,541
makes sense.

2291
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,720
It just seems to me it'd be
like the most underappreciated,

2292
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,990
underrated sport in the
u s especially like,

2293
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,450
what is the one thing that people
complain about an MMA like,

2294
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,120
oh fuck and go to the grown.

2295
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,690
You're queer and stop hugging each other.

2296
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,150
No one goes to the ground.

2297
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,200
This is all stand up.

2298
01:02:58,201 --> 01:02:59,040
And yet still,

2299
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:01,090
I think Moyie Thai also,

2300
01:03:01,091 --> 01:03:02,510
it was much more entertaining.

2301
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,150
Inboxing,

2302
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:03,983
straight boxing.

2303
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:04,951
Oh yeah,

2304
01:03:04,951 --> 01:03:05,610
for sure.

2305
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,140
And I think boxing's entertaining.

2306
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:07,950
Don't get me wrong,

2307
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,760
the greed,

2308
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,660
I still enjoy it.

2309
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,680
But yeah,

2310
01:03:10,681 --> 01:03:11,514
I mean,

2311
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,370
so the talent's there and the
people to watch it or here.

2312
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:15,780
So where's the problem lies?

2313
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:17,670
They're going to show it to us.

2314
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:19,050
Show us the fucking replay.

2315
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:19,711
Yeah.

2316
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:19,921
I mean,

2317
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,030
that's a part of the problem.

2318
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:25,830
They call them Joseph Joe Schilling is
that you get these Thai guys beating up

2319
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,641
Americans.

2320
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:27,030
So,

2321
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:27,840
okay,

2322
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,310
this is world class kickboxing.

2323
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:31,190
So we're going to make
a match up with there.

2324
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:34,320
One of our American up going American
stars and we're going to match them up

2325
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:36,620
with a guy with 160 fights there.

2326
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,030
Kind of fucking interesting,

2327
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,290
interesting.

2328
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:41,190
Let's see it again.

2329
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,680
So there is a right hand.

2330
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:45,003
Okay.

2331
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:46,570
Is that right hand?

2332
01:03:46,571 --> 01:03:48,460
The what's short circuited in them?

2333
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:52,090
Hmm.

2334
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:52,960
And this is what the end,

2335
01:03:52,961 --> 01:03:53,321
the end.

2336
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:53,861
This is the ends.

2337
01:03:53,861 --> 01:03:54,300
It,

2338
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:54,570
he,

2339
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:58,210
the referee should have fucking called
did that guy's behind him waving it off.

2340
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:59,800
Who's the guy waving it off?

2341
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,680
He was like an official.

2342
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:04,603
Hmm.

2343
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:06,403
Incredible.

2344
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:07,431
Well,

2345
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:08,150
either way,

2346
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,090
who makes that match up?

2347
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:10,490
That's a good question.

2348
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,110
Why would you make that match up?

2349
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:14,123
Yeah.

2350
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:19,200
I mean maybe they just need it
to fight pain on 600 hundred,

2351
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,510
260 something.

2352
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:21,580
Thank,

2353
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,430
he literally has

2354
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,690
16 times more fights.

2355
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,003
That's crazy,

2356
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,633
man.

2357
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:32,641
Well,

2358
01:04:32,641 --> 01:04:33,550
he's a bad motherfucker,

2359
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:34,380
that's for sure.

2360
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:34,620
No,

2361
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,940
it just interesting to see.

2362
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:36,950
Uh,

2363
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:37,210
I,

2364
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:42,210
I would hate for glory and for kickboxing
in general to stay at this level about

2365
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:44,130
the heart on Casey.

2366
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:45,120
We're all sitting here saying,

2367
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:46,470
stop the fight stuff of the fight.

2368
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,380
He ain't going to stop
the fight he wanted to.

2369
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,390
Exactly.

2370
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:49,580
Yeah,

2371
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:50,341
you get it knocked me out.

2372
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:52,110
Account guys are fucking monster.

2373
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:54,390
He didn't even try to take a
knee when he couldn't stand up.

2374
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:54,660
You know,

2375
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,290
he didn't,

2376
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:55,801
he didn't say,

2377
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:56,970
let me just take a knee here.

2378
01:04:56,971 --> 01:05:00,380
And is he praying to the
Thai king who just died?

2379
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,091
Just died.

2380
01:05:01,091 --> 01:05:01,924
Yeah.

2381
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:03,600
So that's really common too.

2382
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:04,440
Also in Thailand,

2383
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,363
they always,

2384
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,390
there's always usually carried a photo
of the king to the ring and whatnot.

2385
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:11,730
Very loyal to the king over there.

2386
01:05:11,731 --> 01:05:14,160
So when the king passed
away here recently,

2387
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:14,821
it was last week,

2388
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:17,980
I think it's like a really big deal to the

2389
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,320
Thai people may hear if Obama died,

2390
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:21,460
it would be like a big deal,

2391
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:23,120
but not enough people would be as

2392
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,540
Malaparte.

2393
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,750
It had a picture and he
posted something on his,

2394
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:30,610
on his Instagram about it.

2395
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,330
And I don't know if anybody's
standing near with a tribute to Obama,

2396
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,220
they wouldn't get any of our presence.

2397
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:36,610
Yeah.

2398
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:37,780
If Obama got shot,

2399
01:05:37,781 --> 01:05:39,100
maybe a month into office,

2400
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:39,934
people would be sad.

2401
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,820
But after a month they were already
blaming him for the economy,

2402
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:44,123
you know?

2403
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,460
But after eight years,

2404
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:46,510
yeah,

2405
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,150
he'll probably get shot now they're
just going to repeal Obamacare.

2406
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,420
The same type of people that still
want to have confederate flags would be

2407
01:05:52,421 --> 01:05:53,254
cheering.

2408
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,000
Those people be so happy.

2409
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:01,050
I go back to Texas sometimes and literally
two miles from my daughter's house on

2410
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:02,480
a corner on a,

2411
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:02,801
on a,

2412
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:04,300
on a highway intersection.

2413
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:04,990
There's,

2414
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:08,890
they just got confederate flags just
lined up hanging and they're selling them.

2415
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:11,230
They just sit in there and their
trailers selling confederate flags.

2416
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,340
People driving around with confederate
flags flying out of the back of their

2417
01:06:15,341 --> 01:06:15,701
trucks,

2418
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:16,520
their pickups.

2419
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:16,860
It's,

2420
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,710
it's a different,

2421
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,920
it's weird coming out here
because I grew up with,

2422
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,130
I seen that a lot.

2423
01:06:21,131 --> 01:06:21,351
It,

2424
01:06:21,351 --> 01:06:23,470
it wasn't strange to me until I came here,

2425
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,170
lived here for a year and then
went back there and saw it.

2426
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,360
So I grew up in Ohio and
that was like a thing,

2427
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:30,880
but it was like not like a racist thing.

2428
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:33,120
It's like a southern thing
and it's like part of history.

2429
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,310
Know what the fuck are you talking about?

2430
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:36,611
Like,

2431
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:38,420
what the fuck are you talking about?

2432
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,110
No,

2433
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:41,500
it's like redneck.

2434
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:41,890
It's not,

2435
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:42,161
you know,

2436
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:42,801
it's not whatever.

2437
01:06:42,801 --> 01:06:44,540
And I'm really in a grits chip,

2438
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,690
like all pissed off too.

2439
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:46,180
They're like,

2440
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,140
you can't use a,

2441
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,000
like they got rid of it or whatnot.

2442
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,430
Well they were lending history.

2443
01:06:50,431 --> 01:06:50,621
I'm like,

2444
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:51,940
what the fuck kind of history is.

2445
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,030
Yeah.

2446
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:56,810
That's a history you want to fucking
keep or knowledge of the Nazis hung onto

2447
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:57,663
that.

2448
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,060
Germans like there was one
time when we were strong.

2449
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:03,130
Right.

2450
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:03,963
Or the rise

2451
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:04,650
rising,

2452
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:05,483
uh,

2453
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:06,880
rising sun.

2454
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:11,540
That rising sign is still a big issue
with a lot of fighters that have that

2455
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,340
attitude is p hat.

2456
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,470
Yeah.

2457
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:17,020
But some fighters have
that tattooed and you know,

2458
01:07:17,021 --> 01:07:19,150
some people think it's
incredibly offensive.

2459
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,360
Koreans and Chinese people
really get offended by it.

2460
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,140
Yeah.

2461
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:23,680
Yeah.

2462
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,513
I think,

2463
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:25,390
yeah,

2464
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:28,340
it's easy for people outside of
that to not understand what this,

2465
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,640
those symbols actually actually mean.

2466
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:31,840
So this is an interesting fight.

2467
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,430
Cavalera he's a bad motherfucker.

2468
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,030
Um,

2469
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:34,510
uh,

2470
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:35,343
not,

2471
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,170
not familiar with Dallas and neither am I.

2472
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:38,171
He,

2473
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:38,811
I know he fought.

2474
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:39,521
And Gloria before,

2475
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:40,600
this is like his second fight.

2476
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:41,351
His first fight,

2477
01:07:41,351 --> 01:07:41,441
he,

2478
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:43,720
but he took it on like a week's
notice and he found a heavyweight.

2479
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:44,800
Hmm.

2480
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,660
So I dunno cause look at the things,

2481
01:07:47,661 --> 01:07:51,730
there's a couple of guys that drop
weight on this card and the uh,

2482
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,270
the middleweight turning
contender tournament.

2483
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:54,821
There's this guy,

2484
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:55,420
macho,

2485
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,820
macho or Machado and Machado.

2486
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,940
He fought on the contender tournament,

2487
01:08:00,941 --> 01:08:02,500
a tool five at Gloria 32,

2488
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:04,060
but now he's in the
Middle Way tournaments.

2489
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:05,900
So students with Mike's gym,

2490
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,441
he's still,

2491
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:07,740
even though he's finding to a five,

2492
01:08:07,741 --> 01:08:09,230
it's still carrying some body fat on them.

2493
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,710
How many weight classes glory have now?

2494
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,400
Um,

2495
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:17,111
five,

2496
01:08:17,111 --> 01:08:17,510
right?

2497
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,440
45,

2498
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,303
55,

2499
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:20,900
70 85,

2500
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,820
two oh five and heavyweight.

2501
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:23,260
Oh,

2502
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:23,870
they're so close.

2503
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:25,940
Why is it so much like mmm,

2504
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:26,760
because they're unoriginal,

2505
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:30,500
original and they want it to be just
like the UFC to sell to the UFC fans.

2506
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:35,000
That's so we did cause they're
calling two oh five light heavyweight.

2507
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,470
That's hilarious.

2508
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,970
The UFC is what used to,

2509
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,833
uh,

2510
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:42,110
before the UFC he made the
way classes or whatever.

2511
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,520
Middleweight was one 54,

2512
01:08:43,521 --> 01:08:44,331
just like boxing.

2513
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:44,551
Right.

2514
01:08:44,551 --> 01:08:45,384
You know,

2515
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,840
and then there's like junior light heavy.

2516
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,760
There's like a million
types of middleweights.

2517
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:50,040
No,

2518
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:50,570
yeah,

2519
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:50,720
yeah.

2520
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,000
Well middle weight was one 60 but
it was one 54 to one 60 right.

2521
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:59,050
Super Middleweight one 68
light heavyweight one 75
cruiserweight one 95 there

2522
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:01,040
was a time where,

2523
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:05,660
you know the UFC didn't even have a
55 when eve Edwards as the baddest

2524
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:07,460
motherfucking 55 on the planet.

2525
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,530
You were the uncrown champ man.

2526
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,610
It's a long time ago.

2527
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:11,541
Long time ago.

2528
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:16,100
But you were the uncrown champ when
the UFC eliminated that right after you

2529
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:17,480
knocked out Josh Thompson,

2530
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,430
you were the consensus best
155 pound guy in the planet.

2531
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,600
And then the UFC said yeah,

2532
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:25,730
it never really ended this way.

2533
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:26,564
Class.

2534
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:28,520
Yeah.

2535
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,710
That was in the hemorrhaging
money money days.

2536
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:31,573
They didn't have any money.

2537
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,080
No kind of sucked.

2538
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:34,100
But it is what it is.

2539
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:34,934
Right?

2540
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:36,950
No Man should give you
a fucking belt though.

2541
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:37,690
Yeah.

2542
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:39,090
This is break you off of this.

2543
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:39,850
Break you off.

2544
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,900
Shit out this.

2545
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,080
This is still something for the Mantel.

2546
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,110
And I just go home and I put my,

2547
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,221
put my,

2548
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:47,520
I make a playlist on,

2549
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,310
on fight pass and

2550
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,340
watch my journey to the title.

2551
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,640
Pretend that I can just
take a burlap sack.

2552
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:56,040
Philadelphia,

2553
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,873
the light bulbs

2554
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,650
you hear that sounds like a burlap sack.

2555
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:07,340
Didn't know in that fight Aaron Riley
had happened his entire lower jaw

2556
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:11,630
reconstructed with like metal and
have his teeth wired into place.

2557
01:10:11,631 --> 01:10:12,930
And I did.

2558
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,900
I didn't know he had all those wires.

2559
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,070
I knew he had to have surgery.

2560
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,290
I knew he had surgery goes,

2561
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:18,320
it's pretty significant.

2562
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:20,570
I think you literally broke the,

2563
01:10:20,571 --> 01:10:24,050
where the teeth connect to his lower jaw.

2564
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:25,550
I think you snapped all that.

2565
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:29,840
Hence the light bulb analogy.

2566
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,630
It makes more sense now that for sure.

2567
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:33,230
Yeah.

2568
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:36,710
It sounds like it's Dick move
into the house and you're like,

2569
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:37,700
I know he had surgery.

2570
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:37,821
Like,

2571
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:38,870
cause you were fucking,

2572
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:41,630
uh,

2573
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,190
I wrote that down in my diary.

2574
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,330
Dear diary.

2575
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:48,620
Aaron Riley had surgery to
Aaron [inaudible] has been
on the receiving end of

2576
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:50,630
some fucking ruthless fights.

2577
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,580
The Robbie Robbie Lawler.

2578
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:54,410
He introduced Robbie Lawler to the EOC.

2579
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,960
I know that was in fun.

2580
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:58,770
And then Chris leaving.

2581
01:10:59,760 --> 01:10:59,880
No,

2582
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,370
not crazy.

2583
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:01,550
Leave and I'm sorry Chris Lidell.

2584
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,103
Yeah.

2585
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,900
Well Chris Liebing introduced
the world to Anderson.

2586
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,030
Yeah.

2587
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,420
That was tailor made tailor made for him.

2588
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:13,410
Yeah,

2589
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:13,981
I remember that.

2590
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:14,814
He went there if like,

2591
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,260
I mean you always go into a fight.

2592
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:16,771
Confident,

2593
01:11:16,771 --> 01:11:17,970
but he went into that fight.

2594
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:19,380
It's confidence leaving can beat.

2595
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:20,613
Yeah.

2596
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,380
And then it was like,

2597
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,041
hello world.

2598
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,000
I'm Anderson Silva.

2599
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:24,953
Yeah.

2600
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:29,370
That was when Anderson was really like,

2601
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:34,510
he had taken time off of pride and then
he went and fought in cage rage and he

2602
01:11:34,511 --> 01:11:35,131
cage rage.

2603
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:37,890
It really came into his own
when he fought cage rage.

2604
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:41,100
Those are some of the most impressive
fights you ever had an entire career.

2605
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,031
Oh yeah.

2606
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,500
Tony fricking with the back elbow.

2607
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,460
How about Lee Marie?

2608
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,440
Beat the fuck out of Lee Marie.

2609
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,830
Beat the fuck out of him and
Lee Marie was scary back then.

2610
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,050
It wasn't Lee Marie like a,

2611
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:53,820
I heard he's like a fucking debt
collector or something over there.

2612
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,070
Oh,

2613
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,541
he's way,

2614
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,374
way

2615
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,210
most gangsters.

2616
01:11:57,211 --> 01:11:58,600
Gangster that ever gangster

2617
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:01,280
lean.

2618
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,520
Mary's responsible.

2619
01:12:02,521 --> 01:12:06,810
He was one part of the biggest armed
robbery in the history of England.

2620
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,780
He's still in jail in Morocco.

2621
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,080
He got a girl pregnant from jail.

2622
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:14,430
That's how strong his comments.

2623
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:19,530
He fathered a child while he was
in the pokey Pablo Escobar stuff.

2624
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:20,881
He,

2625
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:21,714
um,

2626
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,300
he also interested in
also had a crazy fight.

2627
01:12:24,301 --> 01:12:25,320
Would Jorge Rivera,

2628
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:26,250
do you remember that fight?

2629
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:28,080
We're Rivera.

2630
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:33,140
He let Rivera Punch him in the face cause
Rivera was like a hard hitter and he

2631
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:37,350
stood right in front of Rivera and Rivera
clinch out with them and hit it with

2632
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:38,184
bombs.

2633
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:39,031
He's stood out.

2634
01:12:39,031 --> 01:12:40,200
I'm looking at him hitting him

2635
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:43,170
and if he needs to be a beast,

2636
01:12:43,171 --> 01:12:44,420
I remember from,

2637
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:45,280
from where he was fine.

2638
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:45,691
You know,

2639
01:12:45,691 --> 01:12:47,820
Anderson used to fight 167 pounds.

2640
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:48,041
Yeah.

2641
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:48,874
And Pride.

2642
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:50,840
Judo all that's right.

2643
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,331
It does it shoot.

2644
01:12:51,331 --> 01:12:51,751
Oh champ.

2645
01:12:51,751 --> 01:12:54,810
He beats soccer I for the belt one 67.

2646
01:12:54,811 --> 01:12:55,320
Wow.

2647
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,820
That was like in [inaudible] 99.

2648
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,850
Do you remember that
kid who used to fight?

2649
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,560
What the fuck was his name?

2650
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:03,750
He used to call himself
the Brazilian killer.

2651
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:04,770
Alex.

2652
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,390
Steve Blank's Taleb.

2653
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,360
Alex dribbling.

2654
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:08,910
Yeah.

2655
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:11,970
He's to call himself the Brazilian killer
because he beat a bunch of Brazilians

2656
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:16,971
as tough ass white dude and a Anderson
Shin to Muckross the eyebrow and opened

2657
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:19,290
up a new vagina on his forehead.

2658
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:21,331
Yeah,

2659
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:21,751
Steven,

2660
01:13:21,751 --> 01:13:23,820
it was Steven was bad until that happened.

2661
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:24,893
Yeah.

2662
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,090
Addison will change your life,

2663
01:13:27,091 --> 01:13:27,750
man.

2664
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:28,350
Yeah.

2665
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:29,970
He'll open up a vagina on your forehead.

2666
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,950
What he did to Carlos Newton and pride.

2667
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:32,873
Oh yeah.

2668
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:34,230
A flying knee.

2669
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,333
Boom.

2670
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:37,303
It,

2671
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,150
it's weird.

2672
01:13:39,151 --> 01:13:40,350
Some of the losses that he had,

2673
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,210
the like the Real Joan and oh yeah.

2674
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,460
It's like had a broken
foot going into that fight.

2675
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,540
Oh yeah.

2676
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:46,643
I didn't know that.

2677
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,370
Yeah.

2678
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:50,160
Real CHONe and hit him with
the craziest flying scissor.

2679
01:13:50,161 --> 01:13:50,940
He'll hook,

2680
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:51,541
tap out.

2681
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:51,960
Ever.

2682
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,460
Was it on that foot like
you probably like right away

2683
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:56,830
maybe,

2684
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,250
but I honestly chose him,

2685
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,880
was beating him on the feet.

2686
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,920
Anderson did not look good in that fight.

2687
01:14:01,921 --> 01:14:03,210
His timing was off.

2688
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:04,044
It was tentative.

2689
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:06,270
He just wasn't properly prepared.

2690
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:10,620
But that was also when he was going
through this transitionary period where he

2691
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:11,260
left,

2692
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:11,740
um,

2693
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,920
shoot the box and he
started Moitai Dream Team.

2694
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:15,490
You remember that?

2695
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:16,240
Yup.

2696
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:16,451
Yeah,

2697
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:16,780
he,

2698
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,613
he,

2699
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,790
he had uh,

2700
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:22,870
like left and then sort of established is,

2701
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:26,220
it was like he was in the middle of
like transitioning between gyms and I,

2702
01:14:26,221 --> 01:14:29,680
I just don't think he was trained
as well as he had been in the past.

2703
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,120
What's your favorite all time?

2704
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:34,351
Well,

2705
01:14:34,351 --> 01:14:35,230
and not even all the time.

2706
01:14:35,231 --> 01:14:36,940
Let's just go back to,

2707
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,710
because you've been doing
this for a long time,

2708
01:14:38,711 --> 01:14:40,900
even watching them and may the
whole time it's been around.

2709
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:41,734
Joe,

2710
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,650
what's your favorite MMA
fight from back in the day?

2711
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,200
Man,

2712
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,910
I don't know if I have a favorite.

2713
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,040
I don't think I have a favorite,

2714
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,360
but I remember looking forward to those
Vandelay fights more than anything on

2715
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:56,194
the planet.

2716
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:56,980
He just,

2717
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:57,813
my all time,

2718
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:58,301
he'll be like,

2719
01:14:58,301 --> 01:14:58,901
at the time,

2720
01:14:58,901 --> 01:15:03,901
at least my favorite just cause he
was just fucking tornado of chaos.

2721
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:07,000
He was so primal,

2722
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:07,601
you know,

2723
01:15:07,601 --> 01:15:11,590
it was just so filled with rage and he
would be looking at the guy across the

2724
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,990
ring and doing that shit with
his wrist where his role,

2725
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:14,824
his hands.

2726
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:18,700
He was just so fucking crazy like snake.

2727
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:19,350
Yeah.

2728
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,610
Fucking like he uh,

2729
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,230
he was so crazy context or what.

2730
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:27,430
But I think like when
cro cop knocked him out,

2731
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:32,460
that was one of my favorite fights too
because the style that Vandelay used was

2732
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:36,160
not a technical style.

2733
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,620
Like he swung punches with his arms.

2734
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,830
He was very overly
muscled juice to the tits,

2735
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:45,340
just fucking jacked and super aggressive.

2736
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:46,241
And you know,

2737
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:48,520
he knocked a lot of guys out
and want a lot of fights.

2738
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:51,310
But when you saw that
shit against cro cop,

2739
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:54,820
it was just not flying and it
just was not going to happen.

2740
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,990
Like Cro cop was at a completely
different level when he came to striking.

2741
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:03,490
And then in that fight Vandelay striking
was exposed because I remember watching

2742
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:03,971
a,

2743
01:16:03,971 --> 01:16:08,770
a of an old school Vandelay fight with
a friend of mine who was a striker who

2744
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:09,431
knew how to box.

2745
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:09,701
It's like,

2746
01:16:09,701 --> 01:16:09,971
God,

2747
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:12,010
this guy throws his wild ass punches.

2748
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:12,390
He,

2749
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:12,551
you know,

2750
01:16:12,551 --> 01:16:14,590
he doesn't cover his chin and he just,

2751
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:15,220
just,

2752
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:19,830
everything is arm punches and looping
like MMA striking is kind of fucked up.

2753
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:20,170
I'm like,

2754
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,003
wow.

2755
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:21,641
You know,

2756
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:23,440
I mean it's easier said than done.

2757
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:26,590
Like there's a lot of good strikers who
stood in front of Angela and panicked

2758
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,770
cause he was just so fucking
crazy and screaming and

2759
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:32,830
all he has to do is land one of those.

2760
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:34,463
Oh yeah.

2761
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,460
But I'm with Cro,

2762
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:37,180
cop,

2763
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:37,391
Cro,

2764
01:16:37,391 --> 01:16:38,090
cop it,

2765
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,100
the first fight,

2766
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,110
it was one of those weird rules.

2767
01:16:41,111 --> 01:16:41,451
Fights.

2768
01:16:41,451 --> 01:16:43,570
I remember that they had shorter rounds.

2769
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,550
They limited the amount
of time on the ground.

2770
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:46,991
It was a,

2771
01:16:46,991 --> 01:16:48,040
and it was a draw.

2772
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:53,130
It wasn't a fight where they had a
distinctive decision like you couldn't me,

2773
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:54,220
we'll make any on that.

2774
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:59,850
Because the betting line was the,

2775
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:00,491
I guess the,

2776
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:00,811
the,

2777
01:17:00,811 --> 01:17:01,030
the,

2778
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:02,590
the people putting up the betting line,

2779
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,080
they didn't realize that if
the fight went to the distance,

2780
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:06,310
it was a draw automatic.

2781
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,121
Oh,

2782
01:17:07,121 --> 01:17:08,290
so they bet for the draw.

2783
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,550
Yeah.

2784
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,600
And they paid out to,

2785
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,170
hmm.

2786
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:12,980
That's interesting.

2787
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,410
But that was back when you
could fucking Ben Online,

2788
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:16,160
man.

2789
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:16,420
God,

2790
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,930
they got to bring that back.

2791
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,060
I would be betting on everything online.

2792
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:21,530
If online betting was still there,

2793
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,150
I'd been on this for fun.

2794
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,290
Why not?

2795
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:24,920
Right?

2796
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,340
This isn't the books here at kings is,

2797
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,193
are they shut draft,

2798
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,090
draft draftkings is fantasy.

2799
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:29,953
It's different.

2800
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,130
It's like,

2801
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:31,340
you know,

2802
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,330
you pick fighters,

2803
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:33,081
you pick rounds.

2804
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,730
It's like a sneaky way of getting around.

2805
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:37,130
Gambling could kind of gamble,

2806
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:38,570
but it's not the same.

2807
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,630
I want to be able to bet
50 bucks on this guy.

2808
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,460
I want to bet 100 bucks on that guy.

2809
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:46,400
I want to be able to bet
I'm a fucking grown man.

2810
01:17:46,401 --> 01:17:47,420
I pay taxes.

2811
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:49,723
American.

2812
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:51,170
Isn't that what Bo dog was?

2813
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:52,123
Yes.

2814
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,330
Well that's why that guy,

2815
01:17:53,331 --> 01:17:55,460
Calvin Ayre had to leave the country.

2816
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,360
He,

2817
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:56,661
he's,

2818
01:17:56,661 --> 01:18:01,661
he's a criminal because he had all this
online gambling shit going on and he was

2819
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,380
an American citizen,

2820
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:05,090
so he can't even live in America anymore.

2821
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:05,961
Not only that,

2822
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:08,060
I don't even think he's
allowed to visit America.

2823
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,610
I think Calvin Ayre
lives in like Costa Rica.

2824
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:11,870
Do you remember Calvin air?

2825
01:18:11,871 --> 01:18:13,040
Do you remember Bo dog fight?

2826
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,770
I remember about does
somebody else like that too?

2827
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,430
Um,

2828
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,570
it was a gang of those guys.

2829
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:19,543
Shoot,

2830
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,780
I forget his name.

2831
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,940
There turned a bunch of
entrepreneurs and the criminals

2832
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:26,810
just change the law America.

2833
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:28,243
America.

2834
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,151
But Calvin,

2835
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:31,070
I had some great fights,

2836
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:31,610
man.

2837
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:33,380
He brought the world chill son.

2838
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:34,940
And that was the first Chell Senate fight.

2839
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:37,550
Cain Velasquez headed
first fight on Bodog.

2840
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:38,840
Yup.

2841
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,770
Um,

2842
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:44,420
and he fought for Boda Boda Doug and
he was the Cham Bodog Mazda Mosbey.

2843
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:45,050
Dot.

2844
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:45,950
Jorge Mas at all.

2845
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:47,023
Yeah.

2846
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,350
Yeah,

2847
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:48,651
yeah.

2848
01:18:48,651 --> 01:18:52,630
He put on some good fights and he put
him on the beach and the girls were bang

2849
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:57,670
and he had ring card girls
that just cheesiness gamma
was always like on a beach

2850
01:19:00,591 --> 01:19:01,110
somewhere.

2851
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,690
So most include Costa Rica.

2852
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,530
Exactly.

2853
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:04,280
Costa Rica.

2854
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:04,521
Yeah.

2855
01:19:04,521 --> 01:19:06,560
He put everything on like
where he likes to hang out.

2856
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:07,503
It's like shit,

2857
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:07,791
it's,

2858
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:08,624
have a fight here.

2859
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,280
And then once was in Russia,

2860
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:11,114
that kind of sucked.

2861
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,991
It was cold.

2862
01:19:11,991 --> 01:19:12,621
It was November.

2863
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:12,830
Yeah.

2864
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:13,710
He did it in Russian.

2865
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,690
He had fade or fight.

2866
01:19:14,691 --> 01:19:15,524
Matt Lindland.

2867
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:16,220
Yup,

2868
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,030
that's right.

2869
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:17,630
Remember that?

2870
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:21,560
And I think Matt Lindland
got fucked in the fight.

2871
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:24,020
Remember fade or grab the ropes.

2872
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:29,390
Matt Lindland got the clinch on fader
and Matt Lindland was about to take

2873
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:34,391
forward fade or down a fade or grab the
ropes and held on hard and then reverse

2874
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:38,120
the position because he grabbed the ropes.

2875
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:39,080
You know,

2876
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,800
I remember that and I think Matt
Lindland got fucked financially too,

2877
01:19:42,801 --> 01:19:43,790
if I remember correctly.

2878
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:47,210
I don't think he got paid or he didn't
get paid what he's supposed to get paid

2879
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:47,631
or something.

2880
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:48,980
There was some sort of controversy,

2881
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,160
but the controversy about
the takedown was gigantic.

2882
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:56,870
Could you imagine if it,

2883
01:19:56,871 --> 01:19:59,180
Matt Linden would've
beaten Fader at that time?

2884
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,133
Oh my God,

2885
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,630
I've been crazy at that time.

2886
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:03,620
Fade or was fate or,

2887
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,430
yeah,

2888
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:05,750
but that was post pride,

2889
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:06,380
right?

2890
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,213
That was post.

2891
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:07,890
Yeah.

2892
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:08,190
He

2893
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,750
had gone through a lot of weird shit.

2894
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:09,961
Right.

2895
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:10,794
In pride,

2896
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:14,640
I feel like there's fate or
in pride and I think fate,

2897
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:16,620
Orin pride is the all
time greatest heavyweight.

2898
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,600
I feel like Fade Oren pride.

2899
01:20:18,601 --> 01:20:22,080
If you want to look at like and who
knows what's going on as far as like

2900
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:25,360
chemicals and steroids
and all kinds of shit.

2901
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,020
You who knows because you know
that everybody was doing shit.

2902
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:28,830
Right.

2903
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:32,040
I've told this story before but I've
told this story before but I wish I still

2904
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:32,731
had a copy of it.

2905
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:33,780
But the pride contract,

2906
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,930
the contract says this is what it reads.

2907
01:20:36,931 --> 01:20:39,840
It says you will be tested for cocaine,

2908
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:41,630
heroin and other barbiturates.

2909
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:46,200
Then the very next line was all caps
and said you will not be tested for

2910
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:47,034
steroids

2911
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:53,350
in the contract ends and told me
about that an anyway and since the G.

2912
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:54,511
Yeah,

2913
01:20:54,511 --> 01:20:55,201
he's awesome.

2914
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:56,034
I love that guy.

2915
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,740
He's coming into town so I know
you get a hold of that dude.

2916
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:03,980
I think it was k one k one or heroes
maybe dream I heard but it was like

2917
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,060
everybody would go in for the
drug test and then they were,

2918
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,060
when they came out,

2919
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:13,090
like they were just big cups all the way
along like the on the floor like outs,

2920
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,600
like cups full of Piss but
like nobody's name on it.

2921
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:17,310
And that was their whole
drug testing system.

2922
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,370
But everybody pissed in a cup is ted.

2923
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,640
No clue who's was what.

2924
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:21,723
That's awesome.

2925
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,680
I saw something with ensign on
Viceland a couple of days ago.

2926
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:26,460
Um,

2927
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:26,971
what was he doing?

2928
01:21:26,971 --> 01:21:27,361
It wasn't,

2929
01:21:27,361 --> 01:21:27,721
he wasn't,

2930
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:29,120
he wasn't even hosting the show.

2931
01:21:29,121 --> 01:21:29,954
The Guy,

2932
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:30,900
I don't remember the guy's name.

2933
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:31,734
Anyway,

2934
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:32,581
Ensign was,

2935
01:21:32,581 --> 01:21:32,910
uh,

2936
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:34,290
he had these guys in Japan.

2937
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,153
It was street fighting,

2938
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:36,690
so they had on MMA gloves,

2939
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:37,261
but they like,

2940
01:21:37,261 --> 01:21:37,411
you know,

2941
01:21:37,411 --> 01:21:37,650
I call,

2942
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:38,970
they have the car race,

2943
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:40,260
race car guys.

2944
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,460
It seems like they had,

2945
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:42,510
they parked a bunch of cars.

2946
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:42,960
They meet up,

2947
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,500
made a ring with the cars and they're
just throwing now it with little gloves

2948
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:47,040
on,

2949
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,390
concrete on concrete.

2950
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,830
It's on vice land.

2951
01:21:49,831 --> 01:21:50,011
It's,

2952
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:52,620
I think it's on this week
or it was on last week.

2953
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:54,180
Viceland is crazy.

2954
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,200
I love that network.

2955
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:56,220
That's amazing.

2956
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,530
They put on some insane programs.

2957
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,330
That's like a,

2958
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:00,720
a real man channel.

2959
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:01,583
Like,

2960
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:02,640
you know,

2961
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,600
man cave channel.

2962
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:04,290
You sit,

2963
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:05,960
you sit in your man cave
and just watching it,

2964
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:07,381
have you ever watched?

2965
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:08,460
Fucked US delicious.

2966
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,160
That dude came in here,

2967
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:11,790
man.

2968
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:12,630
He's action.

2969
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:16,350
Bronson smoked more joints in the course
of an hour than anyone in the history

2970
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:17,184
of the podcast.

2971
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:22,310
Half these joints that these roaches
are sitting in the ass shoes.

2972
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:25,800
I never seen anybody just burned through
joints like a chain smoker through

2973
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:26,634
cigarettes,

2974
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,540
two hours.

2975
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:28,650
I mean I was so faded,

2976
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:32,370
I had no idea what we talked about just
three minutes ago and he just keeps,

2977
01:22:32,371 --> 01:22:33,240
he keeps hitting it.

2978
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,160
Snoop is like that.

2979
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,630
I was on a nick,

2980
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:37,830
nick was in town.

2981
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:42,270
He was doing that Gigi and snoop
Dogg is this football thing he does?

2982
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:42,571
No,

2983
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:43,290
it's like a,

2984
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:44,640
it's like a podcast network.

2985
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:45,670
Oh yeah.

2986
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,100
He does it with video.

2987
01:22:47,101 --> 01:22:49,230
Right video up there and uh,

2988
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:53,460
went in there and like he
just blunt after block,

2989
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,353
after block,

2990
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,700
after block after block,

2991
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,450
like through like a pound
that we used to go up.

2992
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,320
We were like,

2993
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,820
we could nick hang with one.

2994
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,241
But it was like,

2995
01:23:02,241 --> 01:23:03,030
it was,

2996
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:03,863
it was rough.

2997
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:05,980
But you can just see like

2998
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,500
how like he was though.

2999
01:23:07,501 --> 01:23:09,690
Like even snoop was like on
some other shit going on.

3000
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:12,430
And then how did it action Bronson
do after smoking all those joints?

3001
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:12,941
Well,

3002
01:23:12,941 --> 01:23:13,774
he's still,

3003
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:16,150
she was barbecued when he got here.

3004
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:18,440
He got here cooked and he got,

3005
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,660
he kept getting cooked.

3006
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:20,921
I mean it was like,

3007
01:23:20,921 --> 01:23:21,071
yeah,

3008
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:21,940
you're done dude.

3009
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:24,220
Like some dudes just don't stop.

3010
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:24,681
I don't,

3011
01:23:24,681 --> 01:23:25,481
I stop man.

3012
01:23:25,481 --> 01:23:27,130
I like when we do podcasts,

3013
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:28,180
I'll take a couple hits and I'm like,

3014
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:29,043
I'm good.

3015
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,221
You guys good?

3016
01:23:30,221 --> 01:23:31,054
We're good.

3017
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:32,740
But some people are never good.

3018
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:33,700
They just keep going.

3019
01:23:33,701 --> 01:23:37,060
I don't understand it because
it's different mentality.

3020
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:38,681
You know who,

3021
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:39,310
uh,

3022
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:42,460
who got me one of the most
high will get the ax kick.

3023
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:43,863
Um,

3024
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,640
do you remember a cabbage?

3025
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:46,661
Cabbage,

3026
01:23:46,661 --> 01:23:47,494
Korea.

3027
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:48,430
A cabbage.

3028
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:50,260
One of my favorite fighters I've ever,

3029
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:51,123
he's an animal.

3030
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,630
The,

3031
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:53,860
that is the kind of fighters
I really want to see.

3032
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:54,910
The people that come back.

3033
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:55,450
Go ahead.

3034
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:56,440
He was in,

3035
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:56,950
uh,

3036
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:59,200
in Vegas and me and him in any bravo.

3037
01:23:59,560 --> 01:23:59,951
We,

3038
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:00,130
uh,

3039
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,500
went to my hotel room and he,

3040
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:01,900
he,

3041
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:06,280
he had this fucking chuck can't take
blonde and we were so high we could,

3042
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,450
we should have stopped.

3043
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:08,680
But he kept saying,

3044
01:24:08,681 --> 01:24:10,270
Yamato the Mushy,

3045
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:10,991
you know,

3046
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:13,150
which means warriors and warrior spirit.

3047
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:16,990
He kept saying that Yamato demoss
she Qi and he'd pass the joint.

3048
01:24:16,991 --> 01:24:17,201
I'm like,

3049
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:17,621
all right,

3050
01:24:17,621 --> 01:24:18,454
man.

3051
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:20,380
Yeah,

3052
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,131
Samurai spirit.

3053
01:24:21,131 --> 01:24:22,660
I don't want to disappoint cabbage.

3054
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:23,823
And we just,

3055
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,450
the rest of the night we're done.

3056
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:26,470
Like we went to a bus,

3057
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,930
we went and ate and then
were just like all paranoid,

3058
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:29,764
fucked up,

3059
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:32,590
contemplating mortality
for the rest of the night.

3060
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:38,290
But he used to save my head's full of
rocks and junk or some shit like that.

3061
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:39,940
It's all full of rocks and junk.

3062
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,590
With that Hawaiian accent,

3063
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:42,911
he could take it,

3064
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:43,060
man.

3065
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:43,720
Oh Man.

3066
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,560
Oh my God.

3067
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:45,660
That fight with Sylvia.

3068
01:24:45,661 --> 01:24:47,280
I remember they fought Tim Silvia.

3069
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:50,930
Tim Silvia beat the
fuck out of him and um,

3070
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:56,880
and our Lawsky to my rescue or Lawsky
kr 10 [inaudible] him in a k one fight.

3071
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:58,953
I want to say,

3072
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,820
I feel like it was a kickboxing fight.

3073
01:25:01,821 --> 01:25:03,020
I feel like it was in Hawaii.

3074
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,253
Yeah,

3075
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:06,351
Dude.

3076
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,300
That dude look like Stephan
Bonner for a second.

3077
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:09,800
Hello.

3078
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,210
Hey,

3079
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:10,391
look,

3080
01:25:10,391 --> 01:25:10,911
it's Joe Schilling,

3081
01:25:10,911 --> 01:25:11,121
ladies.

3082
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:11,690
Gentlemen.

3083
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,880
They only show you getting
your mouthpiece knocked out.

3084
01:25:13,881 --> 01:25:14,714
These fucks?

3085
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:15,201
No,

3086
01:25:15,201 --> 01:25:16,520
that was Simon get in his mouth.

3087
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:16,881
Oh,

3088
01:25:16,881 --> 01:25:17,714
that's right.

3089
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,130
And has he done man?

3090
01:25:25,131 --> 01:25:26,150
What's going on with him now?

3091
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:27,583
I don't know.

3092
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:28,483
I hope so.

3093
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,750
Did you watch,

3094
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:30,020
uh,

3095
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:30,853
the uh,

3096
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,940
Simon Marcus,

3097
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:32,360
uh,

3098
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,260
Jason Wellness fight?

3099
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:34,910
Did you ever want to watch that?

3100
01:25:34,911 --> 01:25:35,601
Saw The highlight?

3101
01:25:35,601 --> 01:25:37,730
I didn't see crazy fight.

3102
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:40,010
Now I'm crazy fight dude.

3103
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:43,100
It's like all the wind went
out out of Simon sales.

3104
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:47,630
Like Jason Wellness was getting battered
early on and Simon look fantastic.

3105
01:25:47,631 --> 01:25:49,160
You look super aggressive,

3106
01:25:49,161 --> 01:25:50,060
super strong.

3107
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,010
But then somewhere,

3108
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,640
somewhere around the second
round it looked like he's
was just losing all of his

3109
01:25:55,641 --> 01:25:57,420
pop and then he did some weird things.

3110
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:59,300
You see that weird thing
he did against the ropes?

3111
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:00,470
That's all he was stood there.

3112
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:03,440
He is like a bravado kind of thing.

3113
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:03,830
Yeah.

3114
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:04,010
Let

3115
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,960
them tee off on him.

3116
01:26:04,961 --> 01:26:08,000
One give it to me and then fucking
gave it to him or I gave it to him.

3117
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:09,320
I have my wellness can crack.

3118
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:10,820
We didn't know that more than anybody.

3119
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:11,713
Yeah.

3120
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:13,761
Yeah.

3121
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:15,050
That should be interesting.

3122
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,010
It looked to me like a Simon sounds even
like Simon was getting tired and you

3123
01:26:19,011 --> 01:26:19,470
know,

3124
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:21,890
and I had heard that he's not
with his old coach anymore.

3125
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,331
It's maybe that's it.

3126
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:24,150
But the,

3127
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:25,810
as I as asking Eva,

3128
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:28,460
being in Denver when I fought there,

3129
01:26:28,461 --> 01:26:29,600
it makes a big difference.

3130
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,430
The high altitude and a,

3131
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:32,810
he's fighting Dustin Jacoby,

3132
01:26:32,811 --> 01:26:34,680
who I don't think it's anywhere near the,

3133
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:38,270
the caliber fighter to
fight a guy like Simon,

3134
01:26:38,271 --> 01:26:40,940
but he's from Denver and that
gives them a lot of advantage of,

3135
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,133
that's tonight.

3136
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:42,530
Yeah.

3137
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,480
Do you think assignment
should recover though?

3138
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:47,060
Mean he got knocked the fuck
out just a couple of months ago?

3139
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:47,740
Yeah.

3140
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,160
I don't think that's good either.

3141
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:49,560
No,

3142
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:49,850
no.

3143
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:50,810
When I knocked him out,

3144
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:52,290
he fought again.

3145
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:53,391
Like I said,

3146
01:26:53,391 --> 01:26:54,280
it's got like that fun part,

3147
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:55,401
but in China,

3148
01:26:55,401 --> 01:26:58,790
like I don't know right away
and it got knocked out again.

3149
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,020
Who Killed Him and China?

3150
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,400
I forget the guy's name.

3151
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:03,350
I don't remember,

3152
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:04,010
but it was an upset.

3153
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:04,551
It's on youtube,

3154
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:05,480
but that was a big upset.

3155
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,520
That's kind of scary.

3156
01:27:07,521 --> 01:27:07,731
You,

3157
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:09,020
you heard about um,

3158
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:09,980
Jordan portions,

3159
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,710
CTE like 25.

3160
01:27:12,711 --> 01:27:13,544
Right.

3161
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:16,610
And he only had two losses and one by Kao.

3162
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:17,941
It's like I,

3163
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,950
I know we got CTE man,

3164
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:21,030
like CTE,

3165
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,630
chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

3166
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:26,050
except for head trauma from head trauma.

3167
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:26,990
Brain damage.

3168
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:27,823
Yeah.

3169
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:31,250
But they can't test it and they
can't see it until you're dead.

3170
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:33,740
Postmodern ma or to autopsy.

3171
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:34,910
Oh,

3172
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:38,960
so it was all it he had it or if the
car portions want me to hit by the car.

3173
01:27:38,961 --> 01:27:39,131
Right,

3174
01:27:39,131 --> 01:27:39,391
right.

3175
01:27:39,391 --> 01:27:40,224
Yeah.

3176
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:43,280
And he was only 25 and then they found
out that he had that and didn't even

3177
01:27:43,281 --> 01:27:43,730
know.

3178
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:44,240
Yeah.

3179
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:44,570
Oh,

3180
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:45,050
that's awful.

3181
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:45,231
Well,

3182
01:27:45,231 --> 01:27:47,390
what's crazy is he was okay.

3183
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:47,841
I mean,

3184
01:27:47,841 --> 01:27:48,920
he was articulate.

3185
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:49,330
He,

3186
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:50,300
he fought well,

3187
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:51,890
he functioning fully functioning,

3188
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,840
and then they do this test
on them and they're like,

3189
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:54,674
yeah.

3190
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:55,310
Well,

3191
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:58,340
what they're concerned with is
that they're missing out on,

3192
01:27:58,580 --> 01:27:58,821
you know,

3193
01:27:58,821 --> 01:28:01,010
a lot of the damage that,

3194
01:28:01,011 --> 01:28:01,844
uh,

3195
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:02,541
you're,

3196
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:07,010
you're getting in the gym and that
there's no way to really detect it until

3197
01:28:07,011 --> 01:28:07,844
you're dead.

3198
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:11,690
But it's just like the slow creeping
thing that's happening to you.

3199
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:13,490
And then,

3200
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:14,323
I mean,

3201
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,230
when,

3202
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,930
when does it like a guy like
Jordan portion is 25 years,

3203
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:19,130
it'll fully functional,

3204
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:20,360
articulate.

3205
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,520
He can hang with any conversation.

3206
01:28:22,521 --> 01:28:26,530
But then what does that
mean when he's 60 or 44?

3207
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,620
That's the big question.

3208
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:28,550
What does that mean?

3209
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:29,600
Yeah.

3210
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,460
What does it mean for
a guy like Peter Hertz?

3211
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,770
It has been Kol like 14 times,

3212
01:28:33,771 --> 01:28:34,604
right?

3213
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:35,940
Yeah,

3214
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:36,750
no,

3215
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:37,583
yeah,

3216
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:38,650
yeah.

3217
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:40,310
Fucking a Cyborg.

3218
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,863
Yeah.

3219
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,860
Yeah.

3220
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:43,810
If he didn't have it before,

3221
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:44,481
after that me,

3222
01:28:44,481 --> 01:28:45,314
he's got it now.

3223
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:46,670
He probably has,

3224
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:48,050
if he has it after,

3225
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:48,351
you know,

3226
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:49,040
just two of them.

3227
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:49,980
I'm sure I already have it.

3228
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:51,830
I think we all,

3229
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:52,030
I,

3230
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:53,820
I promise you there's,

3231
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:54,380
you know,

3232
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:55,340
they all have a role player.

3233
01:28:55,341 --> 01:28:56,300
My cousin was,

3234
01:28:56,301 --> 01:29:00,170
had had concussions and
multiple concussions just
playing high school football,

3235
01:29:00,171 --> 01:29:00,610
you know?

3236
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,443
Yeah.

3237
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,530
Fuck yeah.

3238
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:05,240
That's probably,

3239
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:05,721
I mean,

3240
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:05,811
if,

3241
01:29:05,811 --> 01:29:06,680
if you could see it,

3242
01:29:06,681 --> 01:29:07,491
that would probably be,

3243
01:29:07,491 --> 01:29:08,030
uh,

3244
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:09,380
an epidemic right now.

3245
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,150
If you could see who had it.

3246
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:11,660
Right.

3247
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:13,600
It was like a light bulb
that went off on their head.

3248
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:14,800
And what do we know about it though?

3249
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:15,981
Like what?

3250
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:19,570
What does this degenerative takes time
to show it's full affects eight to 10

3251
01:29:19,571 --> 01:29:21,460
years after you're diagnosed with it,

3252
01:29:21,461 --> 01:29:24,160
you really start seeing the damage
because it slowly gets worse.

3253
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:28,060
Start drooling and Sheila depending
of course on whether or not you still

3254
01:29:28,061 --> 01:29:28,960
receive damage.

3255
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:33,540
Supposedly there's some athletes and NFL
athletes that either kill themselves or

3256
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:34,201
did some,

3257
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:39,150
some extremely violent things because
they weren't fully functioning like that.

3258
01:29:39,151 --> 01:29:40,260
A Will Smith movie.

3259
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:41,551
That's what it is.

3260
01:29:41,551 --> 01:29:42,570
That's exactly what it is.

3261
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:43,621
Yeah.

3262
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:45,350
It's not like they think
about like these uh,

3263
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:46,770
the uh,

3264
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:49,260
WWF guys are like the
pro wrestlers always.

3265
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:52,950
They always in advantage to fucking
psychotic fucking crazy deaths.

3266
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:53,911
And then everyone's like,

3267
01:29:53,911 --> 01:29:54,091
oh,

3268
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:55,090
they're on steroids with them.

3269
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,270
Maybe they get fucking
slammed in the head and like,

3270
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:59,610
have you seen Kurt angle
outside of the ring?

3271
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:00,170
Lilly?

3272
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:01,003
No.

3273
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:02,700
He like looks like crippled,

3274
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:04,050
like can't even turn his hand.

3275
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:04,840
Even hardly moves.

3276
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,150
Like that man looks terrible.

3277
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:07,690
And then they turn the
camera on and he's like,

3278
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:08,021
ah.

3279
01:30:08,021 --> 01:30:08,460
I'm like,

3280
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,360
I pulled us together,

3281
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:11,070
but he looks really fucking bad,

3282
01:30:11,071 --> 01:30:11,390
Huh?

3283
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,223
Yeah.

3284
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:17,310
A buddy of mine just went to a high
school football game and he said in a high

3285
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:18,240
school football game,

3286
01:30:18,241 --> 01:30:20,820
he saw six kids get laid out,

3287
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:24,210
just laid out or their boom collide.

3288
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:29,100
And these kids were just laying down
fucking knocked unconscious out of their

3289
01:30:29,101 --> 01:30:29,934
fucking mind.

3290
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,270
No high school football game.

3291
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:32,230
Think about that though.

3292
01:30:32,231 --> 01:30:34,990
I mean you're taking some of
the Beth and high school there,

3293
01:30:34,991 --> 01:30:35,260
Beth,

3294
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,700
at best athletes in their school.

3295
01:30:36,701 --> 01:30:38,320
But when you get to the NFL level,

3296
01:30:38,321 --> 01:30:38,650
some,

3297
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:40,540
some of the best athletes in the world,

3298
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:45,490
you put them in a box and you just say
go 60 times and they just run into each

3299
01:30:45,491 --> 01:30:46,210
other.

3300
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:47,043
That's what it is.

3301
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,100
It's,

3302
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,920
you know they're going
to have brain trauma.

3303
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,240
This is no way around that.

3304
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:55,720
All of the money comes
in and all of the other,

3305
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:58,390
the other people like
guiding you come into play,

3306
01:30:58,391 --> 01:31:00,550
you know when you're a high school kid,

3307
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:01,481
you know,

3308
01:31:01,481 --> 01:31:02,980
and then you've got
these fucking crazy dads.

3309
01:31:02,981 --> 01:31:03,251
They're like,

3310
01:31:03,251 --> 01:31:03,611
come on.

3311
01:31:03,611 --> 01:31:07,810
So nigga be telling my cousin had like
a broken ankle but like still play the

3312
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,980
fucking state championship was like
in Ohio was like big football town,

3313
01:31:11,981 --> 01:31:12,280
you know.

3314
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,113
And um,

3315
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:13,781
yeah,

3316
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:17,410
he had like multiple concussions and
playing with injuries and all that ship

3317
01:31:17,411 --> 01:31:18,460
because it was like a big deal.

3318
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:19,151
Yeah.

3319
01:31:19,151 --> 01:31:19,990
You gotta be a man.

3320
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:20,351
Yeah.

3321
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:20,950
I got to be a man.

3322
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:21,783
Crazy.

3323
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:23,890
The biggest fight in kickboxing history.

3324
01:31:23,891 --> 01:31:25,120
Butter hires an excellent fighter,

3325
01:31:25,121 --> 01:31:25,931
but it's my time.

3326
01:31:25,931 --> 01:31:26,764
I am the champ

3327
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,470
fighting was Shin protection.

3328
01:31:29,471 --> 01:31:32,650
I had Garrett's already a household
name in Japan where the real men were

3329
01:31:32,651 --> 01:31:34,810
fighting such a g

3330
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:38,950
let's by like the fourth
thing that they were like,

3331
01:31:38,951 --> 01:31:39,131
no,

3332
01:31:39,131 --> 01:31:41,550
you can't say he wrote another
one that he can't say that.

3333
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:42,311
Okay,

3334
01:31:42,311 --> 01:31:43,120
fine.

3335
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:43,871
Your household name.

3336
01:31:43,871 --> 01:31:44,111
Okay,

3337
01:31:44,111 --> 01:31:44,944
we'll take it.

3338
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:46,430
That's going to be a crazy fight,

3339
01:31:46,431 --> 01:31:47,264
man.

3340
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,220
Yeah.

3341
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:48,750
Um,

3342
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:52,790
there's the real problem with all the
CTE shit is there's nothing they can do

3343
01:31:52,791 --> 01:31:53,510
about it.

3344
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:58,510
It's not like you get a broken bone and
they can put in a titanium rod and they

3345
01:31:58,821 --> 01:32:00,400
can screw it in place and yeah,

3346
01:32:00,401 --> 01:32:01,091
my heel up,

3347
01:32:01,091 --> 01:32:02,460
I'll be all right in after awhile.

3348
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:05,303
CBA.

3349
01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:06,660
But it's just that they don't,

3350
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:07,840
we don't know that yet.

3351
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:10,270
I mean there's nothing
they can do about it now.

3352
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:10,570
Right,

3353
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:11,040
right.

3354
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:11,560
But yeah,

3355
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:16,270
so I guess the next step would be to be
figure out a way to test for it while

3356
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:17,350
people are still alive.

3357
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:18,060
But did you,

3358
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:18,671
when you got up here,

3359
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:19,090
Jamie,

3360
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:19,441
what is this?

3361
01:32:19,441 --> 01:32:20,580
This is Joe Nemeth is,

3362
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:21,420
yeah,

3363
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:24,100
he's got under hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

3364
01:32:24,101 --> 01:32:24,490
It says,

3365
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:25,450
ah.

3366
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:26,501
He says he's,

3367
01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:27,820
this is his quote right here.

3368
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:28,840
He's got a trial.

3369
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:31,990
He's trying to get some money for at a
research center where they're going to do

3370
01:32:31,991 --> 01:32:33,160
testing to see if they can.

3371
01:32:33,530 --> 01:32:35,650
So that's my thinking is much clear,

3372
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:37,120
explains finding the right words.

3373
01:32:37,121 --> 01:32:37,821
It's become easier.

3374
01:32:37,821 --> 01:32:39,880
And I remember events with more clarity.

3375
01:32:39,881 --> 01:32:42,370
One of the really great results
of my sleep has improved.

3376
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:47,290
I sleep more soundly and I have vivid
dreams with the therapy now completed.

3377
01:32:47,291 --> 01:32:51,580
Joe maintains that the lasting benefits
are both mental and physical and now

3378
01:32:51,581 --> 01:32:52,720
more energy and strength.

3379
01:32:52,721 --> 01:32:53,554
I feel great.

3380
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,680
How much pussy you think
he's getting still?

3381
01:32:57,430 --> 01:33:01,460
Joe Nemeth used to walk around with a
fucking gigantic for code on when you can

3382
01:33:01,461 --> 01:33:06,400
wear for just balling out
of control and the 1970s

3383
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:09,370
it was an old school dudes,

3384
01:33:09,371 --> 01:33:09,880
man,

3385
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,320
old school football players,

3386
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:13,840
they get fucking banged up.

3387
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:14,841
So yeah,

3388
01:33:14,841 --> 01:33:17,750
I think it's few now that they've
like recognize this is the thing.

3389
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:20,920
Then they get started looking in
to how you fix it or whatever.

3390
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:26,440
But I'm sure like CBD oil and altitude
hyperbaric chambers and all that Shit,

3391
01:33:28,131 --> 01:33:28,500
right?

3392
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:32,010
Well hypobaric is the mushrooms
exact opposite of altitude.

3393
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,110
High altitude is low oxygen.

3394
01:33:34,111 --> 01:33:36,540
Hyperbaric is high altitude or

3395
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:39,580
they find that if they that over,

3396
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,740
they oversaturate you with oxygen,

3397
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:45,340
that all of your cells tend to open up
and then it starts to figure out new ways

3398
01:33:45,341 --> 01:33:46,210
to repair itself.

3399
01:33:46,211 --> 01:33:47,500
Is the idea between that

3400
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:51,870
it's mostly great for broken bones but
supposed to be great when people have

3401
01:33:51,871 --> 01:33:52,351
injuries,

3402
01:33:52,351 --> 01:33:54,480
like a recovery time increases

3403
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,710
well graduate cells increases
your red blood cells.

3404
01:33:57,711 --> 01:33:57,861
Right.

3405
01:33:57,861 --> 01:33:59,270
And that's what helps with the healing.

3406
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:00,411
No,

3407
01:34:00,411 --> 01:34:01,340
I think that's the,

3408
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:02,570
that's the hyper.

3409
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:06,590
The one with less oxygen
increases the red blood cells.

3410
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,650
The more oxygen is what repairs.

3411
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:10,460
Oh.

3412
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,080
And I think that's supposed
to be really good for,

3413
01:34:12,081 --> 01:34:13,580
I did it a few times after my,

3414
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:14,300
uh,

3415
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,530
to repair from like,

3416
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:16,070
uh,

3417
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:16,700
knockouts.

3418
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:17,400
Did you feel it,

3419
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,230
you feel a difference?

3420
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:20,120
I never had felt a difference ever,

3421
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:21,470
like negatively,

3422
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,120
but I just did it to be safe,

3423
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:23,650
safe,

3424
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:23,950
smart.

3425
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:27,530
Are you one of those guys who doesn't
feel like the effects of things?

3426
01:34:27,531 --> 01:34:30,380
Say you're taking some supplement that's
supposed to be great and you don't

3427
01:34:30,381 --> 01:34:31,190
really feel it?

3428
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:31,521
No,

3429
01:34:31,521 --> 01:34:35,330
I feel like I have a really good
awareness of my body and like I try to,

3430
01:34:35,331 --> 01:34:36,560
I tried to be really good about that,

3431
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:39,920
but I mean after like being knocked out
like I felt could have been knocked out

3432
01:34:39,921 --> 01:34:40,701
I think two times,

3433
01:34:40,701 --> 01:34:44,720
three times now where it was like a half
hour after the fire where I still look

3434
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:46,400
real pretty fucked up,

3435
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:46,880
you know?

3436
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,150
And then after that happens
I'm like really aware of
it and like I've even asked

3437
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:50,920
my girl like my,

3438
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:51,711
my being normal,

3439
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:53,450
like my slower.

3440
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,790
I'm like fuck I fuck keep
forgetting my car keys and like,

3441
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:55,971
dude,

3442
01:34:55,971 --> 01:34:57,340
your highest fuck all time.

3443
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:58,183
Now

3444
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:58,851
I'm like,

3445
01:34:58,851 --> 01:35:00,290
are you sure I'm not like dumb or like,

3446
01:35:00,291 --> 01:35:00,531
no,

3447
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:01,640
just do your high.

3448
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,060
We always lost your keys.

3449
01:35:05,061 --> 01:35:07,430
But ironically good for your brain.

3450
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:07,730
Yeah,

3451
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:09,350
it's good for inflammation,

3452
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:12,321
but you never know.

3453
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:15,340
You don't want to end up be that guy that
they didn't know that is like slurring

3454
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:16,030
a slow rise.

3455
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:17,840
We've all seen those
punchy guys in the gym,

3456
01:35:17,841 --> 01:35:18,674
you know,

3457
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,880
and those guys who are punching the gym
and they start talking about finding it

3458
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:22,733
again.

3459
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:24,380
We've all seen those guys where they just,

3460
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,640
they in their mind,

3461
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:26,474
they're just,

3462
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,500
just got to get in shape.

3463
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:28,490
They still got it.

3464
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,000
They can go back and do it again.

3465
01:35:30,001 --> 01:35:30,560
And

3466
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,550
can you just want to tell him,

3467
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:32,773
man,

3468
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:33,440
Joe,

3469
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,273
you said,

3470
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:35,390
um,

3471
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:38,270
after getting knocked up once or twice,

3472
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:39,163
um,

3473
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,120
30 minutes later.

3474
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,780
So I've been knocked out
like two or three times also,

3475
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:46,790
but only one of them do.

3476
01:35:46,791 --> 01:35:51,080
I remember not remembering
a big chunk of change.

3477
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:52,580
So when I flat out,

3478
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:56,510
I don't remember leaving the cage.

3479
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:58,400
I don't remember walking back.

3480
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:59,750
I remember sitting there with,

3481
01:35:59,751 --> 01:36:04,560
with Tyron and somebody else in the
doctor and I'm talking and I'm having it.

3482
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:09,650
I'm literally saying something and then
I realize my wife's in here and I'm Jai.

3483
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:13,990
My consciousness comes back to me in the
middle of while I'm speaking to Tyron,

3484
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,680
I'm talking to Tyron and
I'm looking at my lung.

3485
01:36:15,681 --> 01:36:16,880
Why the hell is she back here?

3486
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:17,810
Like,

3487
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:18,650
and then I ask him,

3488
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:19,280
man,

3489
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,360
he told me what happened.

3490
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:20,751
And I was,

3491
01:36:20,751 --> 01:36:21,680
I couldn't believe it.

3492
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:22,160
I didn't,

3493
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,620
I didn't remember fighting any of that.

3494
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,320
I don't remember any of that.

3495
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:28,970
I just know what happened
cause I watched the tape.

3496
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:31,830
So to this day you don't
have a functional memory?

3497
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:32,920
No,

3498
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,570
I saw a stitch that night and he was like,

3499
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:35,890
we talked on your way back.

3500
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,090
It's backstage.

3501
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:37,690
I don't,

3502
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:39,730
I don't remember that conversation at all.

3503
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,511
I don't remember seeing,

3504
01:36:40,511 --> 01:36:41,350
I don't remember the walk

3505
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:43,740
from the octagon back to the dock

3506
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:46,700
two or three times I've been locked up,

3507
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:48,700
maybe three times,

3508
01:36:48,701 --> 01:36:49,690
probably been knocked out.

3509
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:50,560
And uh,

3510
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,350
it was just one time where that's
ever happened at the exact same thing.

3511
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:54,850
Was it the last one?

3512
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:55,420
No,

3513
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:58,360
it was my first one actually.

3514
01:36:58,361 --> 01:36:59,830
When a psycho one.

3515
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,440
When I'm Simon.

3516
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:03,900
No,

3517
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:04,733
was it Simon?

3518
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:05,860
I think it was Eddie Walker.

3519
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:07,570
Did you go lion fight?

3520
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:08,080
I got,

3521
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,830
I was winning the entire fight and went
for like one bass thing and got clipped

3522
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:12,723
and uh,

3523
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:13,840
I,

3524
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,850
they woke me up in the ring and I,

3525
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:16,870
they walked me in backstage,

3526
01:37:16,871 --> 01:37:18,610
but I don't remember walking backstage.

3527
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,080
And I remember La Scott
can't the lion fight.

3528
01:37:22,081 --> 01:37:25,750
A promoter was like checking in on me
and like talking to me and I came to like

3529
01:37:25,751 --> 01:37:28,270
as I was talking to him and I'm like,

3530
01:37:28,271 --> 01:37:28,841
oh coach,

3531
01:37:28,841 --> 01:37:29,361
I need your phone.

3532
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:30,061
And I call my girl,

3533
01:37:30,061 --> 01:37:34,060
let her know I'm okay cause I know they
watched it and I call and she's like

3534
01:37:34,061 --> 01:37:34,511
laughing.

3535
01:37:34,511 --> 01:37:34,721
I'm like,

3536
01:37:34,721 --> 01:37:36,430
what the fuck are you laughing about?

3537
01:37:36,431 --> 01:37:37,660
Like I just got knocked
out and she's like,

3538
01:37:37,661 --> 01:37:38,980
this is the fourth time you called me.

3539
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:39,790
And I was like,

3540
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:41,980
oh other than that I've been,

3541
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:46,970
well since that time it was a
good like 15 minutes that I,

3542
01:37:46,971 --> 01:37:48,420
that I had no recollection of.

3543
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:48,801
Yeah,

3544
01:37:48,801 --> 01:37:49,730
that's the big one,

3545
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:50,001
right?

3546
01:37:50,001 --> 01:37:50,601
What happened?

3547
01:37:50,601 --> 01:37:52,630
And you tell him and then they
ask you again about what happened.

3548
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:54,750
You always see that with the
guy in the back locked up.

3549
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,520
Like what happened though?

3550
01:37:56,521 --> 01:37:57,570
And like five minutes they're like,

3551
01:37:57,571 --> 01:37:58,230
what happened?

3552
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:58,950
I'm like,

3553
01:37:58,950 --> 01:37:59,170
Bro,

3554
01:37:59,170 --> 01:38:00,600
he's still got knocked out like you were.

3555
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:01,553
You got fucked up.

3556
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:03,493
Scary.

3557
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:08,130
That is such a weird thing
that the missing time thing.

3558
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:09,421
Yeah,

3559
01:38:09,421 --> 01:38:10,320
because I mean you're,

3560
01:38:10,321 --> 01:38:10,710
you're,

3561
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:13,920
you're interacting with
people and like what is that?

3562
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:14,101
Well,

3563
01:38:14,101 --> 01:38:14,611
how does your,

3564
01:38:14,611 --> 01:38:18,390
what part of your brain is turned
off for that period of time?

3565
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:19,320
Yeah,

3566
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,520
that's strange.

3567
01:38:20,521 --> 01:38:21,031
It's scary,

3568
01:38:21,031 --> 01:38:21,420
dude.

3569
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:24,660
That was why after
Overeem fought Steve Bay,

3570
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:25,553
I was like,

3571
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,520
you can't do this anymore.

3572
01:38:26,521 --> 01:38:28,440
I can't interview guys
after they got knocked out.

3573
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:29,251
It's just not fair.

3574
01:38:29,251 --> 01:38:30,084
It's just not,

3575
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:30,990
it's not right.

3576
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:31,320
Yeah.

3577
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,610
That was really cool of you to do that.

3578
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,350
Like quieter from that perspective.

3579
01:38:34,351 --> 01:38:34,640
Like I,

3580
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,240
that was like dope shit that you,

3581
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:37,810
you said that like stuck up for them.

3582
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:39,720
Cause watching it as a fighter,

3583
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:40,261
you always like,

3584
01:38:40,261 --> 01:38:43,710
I'm a cup of guy that if somebody
starts saying something embarrassing,

3585
01:38:43,711 --> 01:38:44,880
like I almost want to turn it off.

3586
01:38:44,881 --> 01:38:47,100
Like I get embarrassed
for people all the time.

3587
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:48,930
Yeah.

3588
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:49,591
People think that,

3589
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:50,424
like I said,

3590
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:52,080
a hung over him out to dry.

3591
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:53,760
I didn't know if he was right or not.

3592
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:54,090
Yeah.

3593
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:54,631
I didn't know.

3594
01:38:54,631 --> 01:38:58,170
I mean if you don't know what we're
talking about after the fight over him got

3595
01:38:58,171 --> 01:38:58,711
knocked out,

3596
01:38:58,711 --> 01:38:59,730
knocked out pretty bad,

3597
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:00,241
but he was,

3598
01:39:00,241 --> 01:39:01,650
it was a fight where there was moments.

3599
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:02,880
We had his moments in the fight.

3600
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:03,481
He,

3601
01:39:03,481 --> 01:39:03,721
uh,

3602
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:06,060
he tags tpa had Steve Bay rocked.

3603
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,310
I mean it was a crazy one round.

3604
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:10,950
And after the fight he said,

3605
01:39:10,951 --> 01:39:12,480
you know that Steve Bay one,

3606
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:13,970
but that he feels that,

3607
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:14,341
that,

3608
01:39:14,341 --> 01:39:14,460
uh,

3609
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,990
Steve Bay tapped that.

3610
01:39:15,991 --> 01:39:16,824
He got ahold of the gear.

3611
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:18,180
Steve Bay tapped and I went,

3612
01:39:18,181 --> 01:39:18,990
whoa,

3613
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:19,321
okay,

3614
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:21,720
well let's take a look at
it and we couldn't see it.

3615
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:23,041
And then I said,

3616
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,300
do you think it's at another angle?

3617
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:24,751
And he said,

3618
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:25,021
yes,

3619
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:25,590
I do.

3620
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:25,891
Okay,

3621
01:39:25,891 --> 01:39:26,581
let's see it again.

3622
01:39:26,581 --> 01:39:27,750
So we showed it at different angles.

3623
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:28,860
There was definitely no tap.

3624
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:30,121
And so then I'm like,

3625
01:39:30,121 --> 01:39:30,960
this poor dude,

3626
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:34,470
like he just in front of all
these fucking people in Cleveland,

3627
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:39,600
he just gets knocked out and now it
makes it look like he's a sore loser.

3628
01:39:39,601 --> 01:39:40,680
But you can't,

3629
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:43,080
you can't count on his memory right now.

3630
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:48,300
He just got shut off and Al's
just been shut off a ton of times.

3631
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,890
He's lost in the UFC by knock out,

3632
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:53,220
he's lost to Travis Browne by knockout.

3633
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,560
He's lost to Ben.

3634
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,920
Ben Rothwell by knockout.

3635
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:57,151
Yeah.

3636
01:39:57,151 --> 01:40:00,570
But this is just just to you go
see big foot silver by knockout.

3637
01:40:00,571 --> 01:40:01,170
Steep Amy.

3638
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:01,331
Oh,

3639
01:40:01,331 --> 01:40:01,801
check by.

3640
01:40:01,801 --> 01:40:02,634
Knock out.

3641
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:03,750
Am I missing anybody?

3642
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:08,130
He's been CalEd four times
just in the UFC at least.

3643
01:40:08,131 --> 01:40:08,964
Right?

3644
01:40:08,990 --> 01:40:10,620
Because anybody else Cato Kao dumb.

3645
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,101
No,

3646
01:40:11,101 --> 01:40:16,101
I think that's it in the UFC then you've
got to think all the times it's been

3647
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,543
chaos.

3648
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:19,230
Surrogate Keratan off.

3649
01:40:19,231 --> 01:40:20,064
Knocked him out.

3650
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:20,850
Um,

3651
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,920
shogun knocked him out twice,

3652
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:23,760
right?

3653
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,593
Didn't he?

3654
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:25,320
Um,

3655
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:26,153
chuck,

3656
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:26,551
Chuck,

3657
01:40:26,551 --> 01:40:27,384
Dr Mount.

3658
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:27,990
Yeah.

3659
01:40:27,990 --> 01:40:28,770
Chuck Kale Room.

3660
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,730
A brutal Kao.

3661
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:31,150
Yeah.

3662
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:32,190
Bought or knocked him out.

3663
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:32,611
Bought her,

3664
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:33,130
stopped him.

3665
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:33,330
But,

3666
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:34,260
but the bottom stop,

3667
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:35,310
which was one of the worst ones,

3668
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:36,200
weird stuff,

3669
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,030
was it to knock out two knocked
down thing in a tournament.

3670
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:39,571
You know,

3671
01:40:39,571 --> 01:40:42,540
he got knocked down and they stopped the
fight or they think you can get knocked

3672
01:40:42,541 --> 01:40:42,811
down,

3673
01:40:42,811 --> 01:40:43,860
but he was fucking wobbled.

3674
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:44,281
Yeah,

3675
01:40:44,281 --> 01:40:44,911
you'll wobbled.

3676
01:40:44,911 --> 01:40:47,700
And the last one you got kicked
and he fell down and that was it.

3677
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:50,010
So I mean,

3678
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:52,080
a ton of chaos.

3679
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:53,770
A ton of Kale losses.

3680
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:54,780
Okay.

3681
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:55,890
There should be a really good fight.

3682
01:40:55,891 --> 01:40:56,280
Spirits,

3683
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,113
by the way.

3684
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:01,260
Fargas super tactical and UNRUH
smiling ones on his fire right now.

3685
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:03,600
Is Reus smiling?

3686
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:04,920
Is he thinking about doing MMA?

3687
01:41:04,921 --> 01:41:06,690
Because I'd see him at
Black Zillions a lot.

3688
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:06,901
Yeah,

3689
01:41:06,901 --> 01:41:07,230
he is.

3690
01:41:07,230 --> 01:41:07,740
He's a,

3691
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:08,331
had a couple of them.

3692
01:41:08,331 --> 01:41:09,164
They fights I think,

3693
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:09,990
um,

3694
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:14,490
just recently he's been training with
like things I think for at least a year

3695
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,320
now bouncing back and forth and uh,

3696
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:18,780
you have Varguez really,

3697
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:21,060
really technical and a real tricky,

3698
01:41:21,061 --> 01:41:21,894
but I just think,

3699
01:41:22,430 --> 01:41:22,800
uh,

3700
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,570
response got the experience,

3701
01:41:24,571 --> 01:41:26,270
the high level experience in the uh,

3702
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:27,320
power.

3703
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:28,050
Yeah.

3704
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:29,130
Being in a locker room with,

3705
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,490
with risk Mala hidden pads
as he's probably the hardest
I've ever seen anybody

3706
01:41:32,491 --> 01:41:34,210
like most impressive paddler where you're,

3707
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:34,531
it was like,

3708
01:41:34,531 --> 01:41:35,100
Whoa,

3709
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,150
what the fuck?

3710
01:41:36,151 --> 01:41:36,441
Really?

3711
01:41:36,441 --> 01:41:36,870
And I'm like,

3712
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:38,580
fuck more than Melvin.

3713
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:39,600
Yeah.

3714
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,090
Well I've never,

3715
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:40,330
yeah,

3716
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:42,780
he never seen Melvin in
there and say Japan's two,

3717
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:45,930
there's a video of Melvin and
Mike's holding the pads from Melvin.

3718
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:50,930
He's just like Jesus Christ for
the glory 10 fight in a tournament.

3719
01:41:51,421 --> 01:41:51,970
We all like,

3720
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:54,750
somehow we ended up in this little tiny
room with semi Schiltz in this little

3721
01:41:54,751 --> 01:41:55,620
tiny room with this two.

3722
01:41:55,621 --> 01:41:56,940
And there's like no fucking,

3723
01:41:56,941 --> 01:41:58,410
it was like eight guys.

3724
01:41:58,411 --> 01:42:03,220
One of them send me shelter in this
tiny little room to warm up and a Robin

3725
01:42:03,221 --> 01:42:05,400
starts hitting pads and I didn't
know who Robin was or whatever.

3726
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:06,061
And like,

3727
01:42:06,061 --> 01:42:06,660
uh,

3728
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:08,340
as soon as he hit the pad
the first time I was like,

3729
01:42:08,341 --> 01:42:09,300
Yo move out of this guys.

3730
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:10,800
We'll give them some space.

3731
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:11,663
Call Him Sir.

3732
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:15,960
Like his fucking hit him the hardest
shit hitting the hardest shit and he's

3733
01:42:15,961 --> 01:42:16,410
only,

3734
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:17,850
what is your 145 pounds?

3735
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:21,840
This one is his first fight at
one 45 but he was 55 and he's a,

3736
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:22,621
he's a big fella.

3737
01:42:22,621 --> 01:42:26,820
He's probably what when he was probably
walking around 180 pounds but he's

3738
01:42:26,821 --> 01:42:27,510
pretty short.

3739
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:28,051
He's like five,

3740
01:42:28,051 --> 01:42:28,531
seven,

3741
01:42:28,531 --> 01:42:28,801
five,

3742
01:42:28,801 --> 01:42:29,634
six.

3743
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:30,780
It looks real lean

3744
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:33,133
right now.

3745
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:35,181
Yeah.

3746
01:42:35,181 --> 01:42:37,740
This is an interesting fight cause Varga,

3747
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:38,420
like you said,

3748
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:41,720
real technical and he's not
like a real chance taker.

3749
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:42,613
He fights,

3750
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:44,060
he fights a smart fight.

3751
01:42:45,050 --> 01:42:45,883
Oh.

3752
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:48,650
Whereas we're small and super aggressive

3753
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:51,620
and he got,

3754
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:52,940
the other factor is responding,

3755
01:42:52,941 --> 01:42:56,990
cutting this way to 45 and then also
it being in Denver high altitude.

3756
01:42:56,991 --> 01:42:58,070
And you had a hard way cut,

3757
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:58,993
right?

3758
01:42:59,030 --> 01:42:59,863
Interesting.

3759
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:02,660
E five rounds.

3760
01:43:02,661 --> 01:43:03,260
The title fight.

3761
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:03,980
Oh,

3762
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:04,181
I'm,

3763
01:43:04,181 --> 01:43:05,510
and then Vargas from Canada,

3764
01:43:05,511 --> 01:43:07,990
which I'm assuming is
probably high altitude maybe,

3765
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:14,930
but about my check on that
Montreal is at sea level.

3766
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:20,340
There's no fucking idea how the O'shea
a a boat when he's lost the belt.

3767
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:25,653
No,

3768
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:26,933
didn't he?

3769
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:27,993
I don't know.

3770
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:28,541
I feel like,

3771
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:28,980
you know.

3772
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:30,320
No I don't.

3773
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:31,560
No,

3774
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:32,393
no.

3775
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,670
I thought he lost it to the Adam.

3776
01:43:33,671 --> 01:43:34,360
Chuck D.

3777
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:35,193
Well,

3778
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:36,040
glory.

3779
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,720
If like they're in negotiations,

3780
01:43:37,721 --> 01:43:38,471
it doesn't go well.

3781
01:43:38,471 --> 01:43:40,600
They just fucking give
your belt somebody else

3782
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:43,960
that how it works.

3783
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:44,981
Yeah.

3784
01:43:44,981 --> 01:43:45,820
This shit ain't gone.

3785
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,530
Shit ain't gone correct.

3786
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:48,653
Amazing.

3787
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:49,691
Big.

3788
01:43:49,691 --> 01:43:50,650
Very diplomatic.

3789
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,150
You were talking about Melvin Joe and,

3790
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:59,780
and that dude is an athlete,

3791
01:43:59,781 --> 01:44:00,050
right?

3792
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:00,560
Yeah.

3793
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,180
When he was down in American top team,

3794
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:03,650
I threw the football to him.

3795
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:06,650
He threw a football back of me and
the thing came back like a helicopter.

3796
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:08,020
Well,

3797
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:08,900
he's from Holland.

3798
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:09,801
I know.

3799
01:44:09,801 --> 01:44:11,480
They don't even know what a football is.

3800
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:16,250
It was still weird whizzing
back at you like a fucking yeah,

3801
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,780
that was a stud.

3802
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:22,610
Scary striker knocked out
mark home a one punch man

3803
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:29,120
in an MMA fight and he was outweighed
by literally a hundred pounds.

3804
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:30,610
Yeah.

3805
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:31,040
Yeah.

3806
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:31,221
I mean,

3807
01:44:31,221 --> 01:44:35,300
Mark Hunt was close to 300 pounds and
Melvin was somewhere around 200 pounds,

3808
01:44:35,630 --> 01:44:37,130
probably less than 200 pounds.

3809
01:44:37,131 --> 01:44:38,980
He's always probably like one 91 eight,

3810
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:39,791
five k OTE.

3811
01:44:39,791 --> 01:44:40,624
And what one shot.

3812
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:40,910
Yeah.

3813
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:43,440
Melvin's probably one of my favorite
fighters of all time like that.

3814
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:44,930
But if there was a fight on TV,

3815
01:44:44,931 --> 01:44:46,440
like I'm always going to
turn it on the moment,

3816
01:44:46,450 --> 01:44:46,641
man.

3817
01:44:46,641 --> 01:44:47,000
Off Fire.

3818
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:47,930
When you knocked him out,

3819
01:44:47,931 --> 01:44:50,540
was that a special victory
for you because of that?

3820
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:50,961
Yeah,

3821
01:44:50,961 --> 01:44:51,111
well,

3822
01:44:51,111 --> 01:44:52,490
he was my first like big,

3823
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:53,841
big name,

3824
01:44:53,841 --> 01:44:54,920
I guess for MMA.

3825
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:55,191
You know,

3826
01:44:55,191 --> 01:44:56,480
that was one of the big names.

3827
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:56,841
And,

3828
01:44:56,841 --> 01:44:57,650
uh,

3829
01:44:57,650 --> 01:44:57,921
you know,

3830
01:44:57,921 --> 01:44:58,580
it was a,

3831
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:01,730
it was a guy that like I really looked
up to and like really respected a lot

3832
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:02,051
and,

3833
01:45:02,051 --> 01:45:02,884
uh,

3834
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:04,480
it was like meant a lot to me that,

3835
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:05,690
that I was even gonna fight him.

3836
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:09,140
But I think that that also helped me
stay motivated going into it that had so

3837
01:45:09,141 --> 01:45:09,951
much respect for him.

3838
01:45:09,951 --> 01:45:10,360
So he's,

3839
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:14,690
my worst fights are guys that I don't
think I look at him like I don't think

3840
01:45:14,691 --> 01:45:15,380
he's that good.

3841
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:16,650
I don't mean to like take them widely,

3842
01:45:16,670 --> 01:45:17,780
but I just see them and I'm like,

3843
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:19,030
this is not right.

3844
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:19,730
Scary Guy,

3845
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:20,480
you know?

3846
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,170
And that's like,

3847
01:45:21,170 --> 01:45:23,170
almost all my losses
have been that way to me.

3848
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:24,250
Goes a motherfucker,

3849
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:24,770
dude.

3850
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:25,160
Yeah.

3851
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:26,960
Ego will protect you.

3852
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,820
Make you think you're
going to be all right.

3853
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:34,070
We tend to fight to your Kelo beautiful,

3854
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:35,440
nice left hook of the

3855
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,810
Ethan Stein from glory.

3856
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:39,170
Uh,

3857
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:41,530
he's one of the social media
team and I was talking to,

3858
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:42,980
and I bet money,

3859
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:46,080
but I think his job is he
saying is John's broken?

3860
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:47,420
[inaudible] came out.

3861
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:50,891
Oh,

3862
01:45:50,891 --> 01:45:51,790
he didn't have it in.

3863
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:52,930
Hi.

3864
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:53,763
Sorry.

3865
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:55,691
Oh Man.

3866
01:45:55,691 --> 01:45:58,140
Do you know his mouthpiece out
at the beginning of the round?

3867
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,190
Oh Man.

3868
01:45:59,191 --> 01:46:00,780
He fought around without his mouth.

3869
01:46:00,781 --> 01:46:01,614
Bass.

3870
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:02,700
That's on his corner.

3871
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:03,420
Yeah.

3872
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:07,230
Ban Him like you forgot your mouth piece
wasn't then like unless he got stung in

3873
01:46:07,231 --> 01:46:07,891
the first round,

3874
01:46:07,891 --> 01:46:09,110
didn't know what the fuck was going on.

3875
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,430
Got cracked again.

3876
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:12,453
You got other shit.

3877
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:16,020
Don't believe that shit.

3878
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:16,720
This,

3879
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:19,980
this Doug Jensen mother
fucker come up pieces in it.

3880
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:21,293
I know.

3881
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:22,081
I don't know.

3882
01:46:22,081 --> 01:46:23,510
He might be ice from Canada.

3883
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:25,640
He's from Canada.

3884
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:27,300
They're different up there.

3885
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,740
Two different gene pool.

3886
01:46:30,670 --> 01:46:31,503
Reus smiling.

3887
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:33,143
Cool.

3888
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:34,153
Oof.

3889
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,780
Funny thing about responding
as he has that Dutch style,

3890
01:46:36,781 --> 01:46:38,790
they very rarely black lake cakes there.

3891
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:39,653
Just the,

3892
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:43,970
do you know the typical
Dutch style is who's almost,

3893
01:46:43,971 --> 01:46:44,570
who's tougher?

3894
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:47,080
Fucking hit the answer right back here.

3895
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:47,191
Yeah,

3896
01:46:47,191 --> 01:46:47,840
it's right by,

3897
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:48,980
and I forget which fight it,

3898
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:50,401
but I talked to,

3899
01:46:50,401 --> 01:46:51,234
I texted,

3900
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:51,840
uh,

3901
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,400
Robin and congratulate
them after the finals.

3902
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:54,121
Like you have to be,

3903
01:46:54,121 --> 01:46:59,121
it was Korea and like his legs were like
all fucking purple and his ribs are all

3904
01:46:59,311 --> 01:47:00,090
messed up.

3905
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:00,421
And he's like,

3906
01:47:00,421 --> 01:47:00,601
no,

3907
01:47:00,601 --> 01:47:01,141
I'm never,

3908
01:47:01,141 --> 01:47:02,460
never injured after my fun.

3909
01:47:02,461 --> 01:47:02,940
I never,

3910
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:03,773
I never,

3911
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:04,471
never have a problem.

3912
01:47:04,471 --> 01:47:06,030
I'm never saw and like I,

3913
01:47:06,031 --> 01:47:06,864
oh my,

3914
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:09,310
I already know going into the fight like,

3915
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:09,940
um,

3916
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:13,800
it can if he hasn't got an extra bike
and a tomb and because I'm going to break

3917
01:47:13,801 --> 01:47:15,240
my fucking feet every time.

3918
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:16,441
That a yeah.

3919
01:47:16,441 --> 01:47:17,670
How many times you broke broken your feet?

3920
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,200
I've broken all my toes,

3921
01:47:19,201 --> 01:47:20,160
like at least twice.

3922
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,083
Uh,

3923
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:25,200
I have a couple couple
of wedge joints in my,

3924
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:25,830
um,

3925
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:30,220
on my right foot that a pretty
regularly pop out of the socket after.

3926
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,900
The worst is when the
joints just don't come back.

3927
01:47:33,901 --> 01:47:36,180
They like a lot of the joints in
the foot are kind of like this.

3928
01:47:36,181 --> 01:47:37,200
And then once you break them,

3929
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,580
they go over top of each other.

3930
01:47:39,230 --> 01:47:39,580
Oh,

3931
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:41,520
you went down again and kind
of get that back in there.

3932
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:44,663
Damn.

3933
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,550
We're just moms on tear duties.

3934
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:50,440
So much power and
especially down at one 40,

3935
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:51,461
one 43,

3936
01:47:51,461 --> 01:47:52,294
I guess.

3937
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:53,680
What's the other glory rule?

3938
01:47:53,681 --> 01:47:54,700
Not the three knocked down,

3939
01:47:54,701 --> 01:47:56,050
but not in one round,

3940
01:47:56,051 --> 01:47:56,440
but in the,

3941
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:57,273
in the whole fight.

3942
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:58,403
Uh,

3943
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,370
I think it's four knock downs in a fight.

3944
01:48:00,371 --> 01:48:00,940
Is that what it is?

3945
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:01,773
Yeah.

3946
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:02,320
Yeah.

3947
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:02,740
Oh,

3948
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:03,573
stunned them.

3949
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,380
But that's a,

3950
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:08,520
those are only for
tournaments to those lousy.

3951
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:11,620
Okay.

3952
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:13,210
Tournament's are so fucking crazy.

3953
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:14,290
They really are.

3954
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:14,770
Tie Up.

3955
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:15,603
Tie Up.

3956
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,113
There we go.

3957
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:21,350
Just get out around and reset man.

3958
01:48:21,670 --> 01:48:22,503
Man.

3959
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,950
What they're going to
show that tooth flying out

3960
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:30,823
great.

3961
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:32,790
Mm.

3962
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:33,091
Yeah.

3963
01:48:33,091 --> 01:48:34,530
I went flying into the audience.

3964
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:36,690
That dude?

3965
01:48:36,691 --> 01:48:37,524
Yeah,

3966
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:42,480
that was UFC one soccer
kick or was he on his knees?

3967
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:43,673
He was getting up.

3968
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:44,623
Oh,

3969
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:47,391
I remember that.

3970
01:48:47,391 --> 01:48:48,050
I was,

3971
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:52,760
I came home from school and I read
in the TV Guide magazine or whatever.

3972
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:56,800
They had kickboxing versus
judo versus karate versus song.

3973
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:57,920
And I was like,

3974
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:58,940
my style of bag,

3975
01:48:58,940 --> 01:48:59,601
my Stepdad,

3976
01:48:59,601 --> 01:48:59,930
I was like,

3977
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:00,321
here,

3978
01:49:00,321 --> 01:49:01,550
here's the 20 bucks please.

3979
01:49:01,551 --> 01:49:02,450
I just want to watch this.

3980
01:49:02,451 --> 01:49:03,320
This is good to be awesome.

3981
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:05,491
Well,

3982
01:49:05,491 --> 01:49:06,740
you doing martial arts then?

3983
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:08,660
I was doing traditional martial arts.

3984
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:10,010
I was doing con Kung Fu.

3985
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:12,440
Wow.

3986
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:16,520
I've been doing it for about
two years at that point.

3987
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:19,160
So when you were fine like Erin Riley,

3988
01:49:19,161 --> 01:49:22,970
you were really only doing
martial arts for like six,

3989
01:49:22,971 --> 01:49:23,541
seven years,

3990
01:49:23,541 --> 01:49:23,760
Huh?

3991
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:24,593
Yeah.

3992
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:25,250
Wow.

3993
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:25,911
That's interesting.

3994
01:49:25,911 --> 01:49:26,151
Man.

3995
01:49:26,151 --> 01:49:27,020
You were a quick learner.

3996
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:28,123
Thanks.

3997
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:28,791
It was fun,

3998
01:49:28,791 --> 01:49:29,100
man.

3999
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:31,640
It's easy to pick up on something
when you like doing it though,

4000
01:49:31,641 --> 01:49:32,030
right?

4001
01:49:32,030 --> 01:49:32,421
Of course.

4002
01:49:32,421 --> 01:49:35,600
And when you're young and you're free
and you don't have kids and you're

4003
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:36,560
obsessed.

4004
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:37,310
Yeah,

4005
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:40,740
and you don't know you're
vulnerable yet always in shape,

4006
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:42,940
tired your energy,

4007
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:45,990
live off Mcdonald's all day

4008
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:49,810
is the most awesome thing.

4009
01:49:49,811 --> 01:49:51,260
May in Burger's going to the gym.

4010
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:54,850
I remember hearing that
about Michael Jordan.

4011
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:57,880
Michael Jordan would need a
big Mac before every big game.

4012
01:49:58,640 --> 01:49:58,931
You're like,

4013
01:49:58,931 --> 01:50:00,070
what in the fuck?

4014
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:05,890
I guess if you eat good all the time,

4015
01:50:05,891 --> 01:50:07,330
you get kind of get away with that.

4016
01:50:07,331 --> 01:50:11,230
But you really only get away with that
when you're in your twenties that was

4017
01:50:11,231 --> 01:50:11,800
true.

4018
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:12,400
It's not bullshit.

4019
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:13,000
It's bullshit.

4020
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,850
It's steak and potato is like his game.

4021
01:50:14,851 --> 01:50:15,021
You know?

4022
01:50:15,021 --> 01:50:16,590
I think he was just
sponsored by Mcdonald's.

4023
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:19,690
Oh,

4024
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:20,920
interesting.

4025
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:22,180
Very interesting.

4026
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:23,980
Steak and potatoes make sense?

4027
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:26,530
It makes sense today,

4028
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:32,430
but there's a lot of clips of a Floyd
Mayweather eating cheese cheeseburgers and

4029
01:50:33,401 --> 01:50:34,270
drinking mountain dew,

4030
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:35,350
like between the rounds.

4031
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:35,681
Well,

4032
01:50:35,681 --> 01:50:39,510
he apparently likes to drink soda like
while he's fighting to replenish his

4033
01:50:39,511 --> 01:50:40,420
sugar or not.

4034
01:50:40,421 --> 01:50:40,931
When he's fighting,

4035
01:50:40,931 --> 01:50:43,030
while he's training to
replenish your sugar.

4036
01:50:43,031 --> 01:50:46,390
Like he'll have a long workout and I'll
drink a coke and then isn't he like the

4037
01:50:46,391 --> 01:50:49,300
only guy in Nevada that's allowed
to drink Gatorade between rounds?

4038
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:51,520
What the fuck?

4039
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:52,990
They work that out and look it up.

4040
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:55,480
Pull it up Jamie.

4041
01:50:55,481 --> 01:50:56,380
Not put look it up,

4042
01:50:56,381 --> 01:50:56,681
Jamie.

4043
01:50:56,681 --> 01:50:57,860
Is that really possible?

4044
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,790
You like Gatorade came rounds,

4045
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:03,160
talked about it like the one who
the fuck has allowed to do this?

4046
01:51:03,161 --> 01:51:03,371
It's like,

4047
01:51:03,371 --> 01:51:04,360
well it's Floyd Mayweather.

4048
01:51:04,361 --> 01:51:05,081
You can do what he wants.

4049
01:51:05,081 --> 01:51:06,580
That doesn't seem fair.

4050
01:51:06,581 --> 01:51:07,414
How could that be?

4051
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:09,760
How is that possible when you undefeated,

4052
01:51:09,761 --> 01:51:11,150
why do I remember that though?

4053
01:51:11,151 --> 01:51:13,260
In Nevada you are,

4054
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:15,310
you know the amount of
money that he brings in,

4055
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:16,223
right?

4056
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:17,170
What does it say?

4057
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:18,003
What does it say?

4058
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,720
Roll it back there.

4059
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:23,440
Vargas Vargas bear barred
from drinking Gatorade.

4060
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,690
Fernando San Fernando Vargas.

4061
01:51:25,691 --> 01:51:26,524
What years is

4062
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,190
2006 damn.

4063
01:51:30,191 --> 01:51:32,620
Fernando Vargas was still fighting in 2006

4064
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:35,043
interesting.

4065
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:38,170
He was banned from drinking Gatorade
in his corner between rounds a minute.

4066
01:51:38,171 --> 01:51:38,500
Wait,

4067
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,630
rematch with against Shane Mosley.

4068
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:42,333
Junior middleweight

4069
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:46,460
pull up up gatoraid and Floyd.

4070
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:49,300
Floyd Mayweather didn't come up.

4071
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:52,210
Maybe a just showing just made that shit.

4072
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:53,680
Oh no buddy.

4073
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:57,670
Joe Chilean doesn't trust
you're googling skills.

4074
01:51:57,671 --> 01:51:58,870
Jamie's on his phone.

4075
01:51:59,950 --> 01:52:01,210
I'm going to go to youtube.

4076
01:52:01,211 --> 01:52:02,110
I'll find the video.

4077
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:03,880
I don't know if they got fact check,

4078
01:52:03,881 --> 01:52:05,140
but look drinking Vargas,

4079
01:52:05,150 --> 01:52:08,710
just purple water front kicked
him or the face it happened,

4080
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:09,410
but I'm trying to find,

4081
01:52:09,410 --> 01:52:10,243
okay.

4082
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:14,440
When that Vargas thing came up,

4083
01:52:14,441 --> 01:52:15,940
they reminded me of something I was,

4084
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:17,130
I brought up to you earlier.

4085
01:52:17,131 --> 01:52:17,970
Ogun um,

4086
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:22,450
my favorite fight from back then.

4087
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:24,610
I think you will like this one.

4088
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:26,820
MACACA versus Paley.

4089
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:28,330
Oh yeah man.

4090
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:29,360
The first thing,

4091
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,010
it was good,

4092
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:32,440
cool old school.

4093
01:52:32,590 --> 01:52:36,790
Do you remember what pay late fuck
Chuck Paleo Fudge Chocolate Dell.

4094
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:39,340
And they fought in one of
those rings with the ropes.

4095
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:41,110
The net than the not of the bottom.

4096
01:52:41,190 --> 01:52:41,741
Yeah,

4097
01:52:41,741 --> 01:52:43,600
I remember that shit yet with no gloves.

4098
01:52:43,601 --> 01:52:44,434
No gloves.

4099
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:45,650
Yeah.

4100
01:52:45,650 --> 01:52:46,340
Old School.

4101
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:48,650
Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao.

4102
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:50,330
Was it then?

4103
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,220
Yeah.

4104
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:55,050
It was like a recent
fight that I noticed it.

4105
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:56,880
Do you want to read in between rounds?

4106
01:52:56,881 --> 01:52:59,460
Must be nice to own Nevada
state athletic commission.

4107
01:52:59,520 --> 01:52:59,821
Oh,

4108
01:52:59,821 --> 01:53:01,600
Michael Michael,

4109
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,011
Cassie,

4110
01:53:02,011 --> 01:53:02,844
UFC fighter.

4111
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:03,833
Put that up there.

4112
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:04,703
Oh really?

4113
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:05,221
Yeah.

4114
01:53:05,221 --> 01:53:05,911
What is that?

4115
01:53:05,911 --> 01:53:07,440
How the fuck does he have Gatorade?

4116
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:09,023
Okay.

4117
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:11,113
Hmm.

4118
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:11,481
We'll get that.

4119
01:53:11,481 --> 01:53:13,310
All those MMA fighters commenting.

4120
01:53:13,311 --> 01:53:16,070
Michael Page commented on
a Floyd Mayweather fight.

4121
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,210
Really interesting.

4122
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:22,450
What do you think about this
upcoming Kovalev Andre Ward fight.

4123
01:53:24,490 --> 01:53:25,230
Andre Ward.

4124
01:53:25,230 --> 01:53:28,000
Do you think so really those
think Andre Ward's this.

4125
01:53:28,330 --> 01:53:29,050
I think he's a,

4126
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:30,010
he's a bad mother fucker,

4127
01:53:30,011 --> 01:53:31,330
but Kovalev was a big guy.

4128
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:32,213
Yeah,

4129
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:32,920
I just think he's,

4130
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:33,370
he's just,

4131
01:53:33,370 --> 01:53:34,870
I think pound for pound is,

4132
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:35,170
is,

4133
01:53:35,170 --> 01:53:38,470
I think it's gotta be a Andre Ward.

4134
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:40,690
He's just so smart.

4135
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:44,240
These guys are going off Vargas.

4136
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:44,431
Megan,

4137
01:53:44,431 --> 01:53:45,670
to come back here a little bit.

4138
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:50,343
Another one,

4139
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:51,870
Floyd Mayweather and my team.

4140
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:54,760
The money team might be the only corner
I've ever seen a lot of drink Gatorade

4141
01:53:54,761 --> 01:53:55,540
during a fight.

4142
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:57,370
Aljamain sterling and other MMA fighter.

4143
01:53:57,970 --> 01:54:00,010
All US peasants or demoted to water,

4144
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:02,590
Mayweather,

4145
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:03,011
Berto.

4146
01:54:03,011 --> 01:54:04,120
That was a different fight.

4147
01:54:04,121 --> 01:54:04,954
See all of us.

4148
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:09,400
Mike Dolce,

4149
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:13,240
can someone please explain why Floyd
Mayweather can drink Gatorade during the

4150
01:54:13,241 --> 01:54:14,680
fight in Nevada state athletic commission.

4151
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:17,440
Friends suspend us for
anything but unsealed water.

4152
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:18,693
Interesting.

4153
01:54:19,450 --> 01:54:20,283
Interesting.

4154
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:21,423
Hmm.

4155
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:22,810
I wonder what that was about.

4156
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:25,001
They're just so happy.

4157
01:54:25,001 --> 01:54:26,140
He was making them so much money.

4158
01:54:26,650 --> 01:54:27,610
So much money.

4159
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:30,880
Just such a smart guy in terms of like,

4160
01:54:30,881 --> 01:54:35,230
his style was never the kind of style
that would make a bunch of people come out

4161
01:54:35,231 --> 01:54:36,064
to see him fight.

4162
01:54:36,430 --> 01:54:40,330
But all that shit talking made all
those people want to come see him lose.

4163
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:41,920
It's weird though because some,

4164
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:43,090
I mean some of his fights,

4165
01:54:43,091 --> 01:54:44,860
you see his offense.

4166
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:46,750
I think about um,

4167
01:54:47,230 --> 01:54:47,771
Kodo,

4168
01:54:47,771 --> 01:54:49,300
think about Judah,

4169
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,020
Judah authorities.

4170
01:54:52,450 --> 01:54:53,920
But that was the weird one.

4171
01:54:54,370 --> 01:54:55,450
Angel enough.

4172
01:54:56,050 --> 01:54:57,340
Freddy Not Angel Bedford.

4173
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:58,953
Um,

4174
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:00,670
was it age or mind man?

4175
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:01,593
Freddo

4176
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:03,213
right.

4177
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:04,603
I'm

4178
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:07,630
giving him fucking gate or aid.

4179
01:55:07,631 --> 01:55:08,870
That is fucking crazy.

4180
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:09,753
Gatorade.

4181
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,340
They are opening up a Goddamn Gatorade.

4182
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:13,833
It's a purple drink.

4183
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:15,383
Just the perpetrator.

4184
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:18,260
That is crazy.

4185
01:55:18,261 --> 01:55:19,810
His dad's giving him Gatorade.

4186
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:21,820
That's so illegal.

4187
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:23,770
Wow.

4188
01:55:23,771 --> 01:55:25,900
How the fuck did they get away with that?

4189
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:27,700
Amazing.

4190
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:29,140
That's amazing.

4191
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:31,361
That's in Panama.

4192
01:55:31,361 --> 01:55:32,170
Louis Shit.

4193
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:33,960
I was just thinking of that was
trying to think of my high school.

4194
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,800
That's one of the gimme the other bottle.

4195
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:36,371
Yeah,

4196
01:55:36,371 --> 01:55:37,900
the one I may want a mixed.

4197
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:44,130
All of a sudden he's Aaron
Pryor and Alexis Arguayo

4198
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:47,220
loose from Holland with a nasty
left hook to the body there.

4199
01:55:47,310 --> 01:55:48,070
Oh Shit.

4200
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:48,903
Nothing upper cut.

4201
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:51,500
When I first joined Att Panama Lewis was,

4202
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:52,460
was in there sometimes.

4203
01:55:53,470 --> 01:55:55,050
Was that like being next to the devil

4204
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:59,180
because people don't remember
that Billy Costello fight.

4205
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:00,060
Do you remember that fight?

4206
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:01,853
No.

4207
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:02,490
Um,

4208
01:56:02,490 --> 01:56:05,400
Louie Resto was a fighter
who fought this kid,

4209
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:07,350
I think his name is Billy Castelle Junior.

4210
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:08,191
And uh,

4211
01:56:08,191 --> 01:56:12,540
he was a real promising up and coming
fighter and Louie Resto was a good boxer,

4212
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:16,050
but not like a knockout box or where
it's Collins was a big knockout boxer.

4213
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:17,040
So,

4214
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:17,430
uh,

4215
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:19,680
Louie Resto beats the shit out of college.

4216
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:21,050
When he took the stuff out of the glass,

4217
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,900
Dad grabbed the glove and felt it.

4218
01:56:24,901 --> 01:56:25,734
The Guy,

4219
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:30,330
the dad suspected it and after the fight
he grabbed a hold of wrestles gloves

4220
01:56:30,331 --> 01:56:33,420
and rest pulled away and there
was no stuffing in the glove.

4221
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:34,140
He had,

4222
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:37,770
it's just basically at hand wraps on and
just bare knuckle beat the shit out of

4223
01:56:37,771 --> 01:56:42,450
him and it fucked Collins up
so bad that Collins his eyes,

4224
01:56:42,451 --> 01:56:46,620
he lost his vision and he
lost his ability to fight.

4225
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:51,600
And so after that fight he became a
raging alcoholic and wound up committing

4226
01:56:51,601 --> 01:56:52,410
suicide.

4227
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:53,400
Drove into a tree.

4228
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:54,301
I remember that.

4229
01:56:54,301 --> 01:56:55,410
I saw that documentary.

4230
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:56,253
It was a really good goodness.

4231
01:56:56,670 --> 01:56:59,370
Water and electrolyte drinks
are allowed in the corner.

4232
01:56:59,371 --> 01:57:04,371
Any electrolyte drink must be brought to
the arena in the factory sealed plastic

4233
01:57:04,501 --> 01:57:05,334
bottles.

4234
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,121
Moreover,

4235
01:57:06,121 --> 01:57:09,660
a contestant must provide the commission
and its staff with any information

4236
01:57:09,661 --> 01:57:13,230
about the request to drink in sufficient
time to make a determination as to

4237
01:57:13,231 --> 01:57:14,490
whether to drink is approvable.

4238
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:15,751
Example,

4239
01:57:15,751 --> 01:57:16,620
no stimulants,

4240
01:57:16,621 --> 01:57:17,161
alcohol,

4241
01:57:17,161 --> 01:57:18,600
drugs or questionable ingredients.

4242
01:57:18,601 --> 01:57:19,081
Examples,

4243
01:57:19,081 --> 01:57:22,050
electrolyte drinks that had
been approved include pedialyte,

4244
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:22,801
vitamin,

4245
01:57:22,801 --> 01:57:23,280
water,

4246
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,113
smartwater,

4247
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:25,170
option,

4248
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:26,003
Gatorade,

4249
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:27,420
Powerade and propel.

4250
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:28,530
Huh?

4251
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:29,970
Unless you're an MMA fighter,

4252
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:31,493
is that true?

4253
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:32,550
I mean,

4254
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:33,300
is that what it is?

4255
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:36,390
Isn't the boxing specific
boxing dot NV dot.

4256
01:57:36,410 --> 01:57:38,120
Co does boxing you have um,

4257
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:38,790
different.

4258
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:39,623
Is that Nevada?

4259
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,240
So boxing has different rules.

4260
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:43,223
Is that what it is?

4261
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:46,173
What are you looking for brother?

4262
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:47,340
They have different weight classes.

4263
01:57:49,110 --> 01:57:49,891
Is that possible?

4264
01:57:49,891 --> 01:57:51,450
That boxing has different rules?

4265
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:54,030
Do you want a real joint
instead of that dirty roach?

4266
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:54,361
I'm like,

4267
01:57:54,361 --> 01:57:54,601
well,

4268
01:57:54,601 --> 01:57:55,770
I'm going to smoke one of the fucking,

4269
01:57:55,771 --> 01:57:56,604
what's his name?

4270
01:57:56,770 --> 01:57:58,680
I don't want to fuck his

4271
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:01,463
real one.

4272
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:01,801
Wow,

4273
01:58:01,801 --> 01:58:02,071
man,

4274
01:58:02,071 --> 01:58:02,551
that is,

4275
01:58:02,551 --> 01:58:03,384
um,

4276
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:04,243
that's crazy.

4277
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:07,910
Did they stop the fight
where we were talking?

4278
01:58:07,911 --> 01:58:08,744
Shit,

4279
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:09,981
but it was,

4280
01:58:09,981 --> 01:58:10,820
it was at the fifth round.

4281
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:12,770
I thought it didn't go into the fifth,

4282
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:13,670
but I don't remember.

4283
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:16,240
I do remember seeing a four.

4284
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:21,860
He's so gross.

4285
01:58:21,861 --> 01:58:23,330
So he said so clueless,

4286
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:24,010
clueless.

4287
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:25,160
Just who's that?

4288
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:28,610
What's that gentleman's name?

4289
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:29,713
John Franklin.

4290
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:33,620
He's the glory promoter.

4291
01:58:33,970 --> 01:58:34,820
Supposedly the promoter.

4292
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:36,860
The face of the thing.

4293
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:42,260
So what happened

4294
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:42,501
here?

4295
01:58:42,501 --> 01:58:45,110
We were talking so much
shit about Gatorade.

4296
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:48,110
We missed the ending
of this awesome fight.

4297
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:53,170
What a night.

4298
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:54,340
Boom.

4299
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:56,313
Boom,

4300
01:58:58,710 --> 01:58:59,420
boom.

4301
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:00,540
Vargas is really impressive.

4302
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:01,381
He is.

4303
01:59:01,381 --> 01:59:02,850
He's just let them get too close,

4304
01:59:02,851 --> 01:59:03,490
man.

4305
01:59:03,490 --> 01:59:04,230
Yeah.

4306
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:07,380
I remember him fighting on the lion fight
cards with me because when we coming

4307
01:59:07,381 --> 01:59:09,160
up and then he fought a,

4308
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:12,130
uh,

4309
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:15,573
he's uh,

4310
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:16,761
watching him come up,

4311
01:59:16,761 --> 01:59:17,151
him and,

4312
01:59:17,151 --> 01:59:17,580
um,

4313
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:18,740
Giovanni Bellini where on the,

4314
01:59:18,770 --> 01:59:19,970
on the same cards like,

4315
01:59:19,971 --> 01:59:22,610
cause me coming up at the same
time with a in California.

4316
01:59:22,611 --> 01:59:24,080
So seeing these guys,

4317
01:59:24,081 --> 01:59:26,330
he's gotten really good
and he's really technical.

4318
01:59:26,331 --> 01:59:27,164
He watches,

4319
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:28,490
he always gets his hands.

4320
01:59:28,491 --> 01:59:29,324
Come right back.

4321
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:30,573
Robin mentoree smile.

4322
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:32,210
It was just a super high level.

4323
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:33,283
It's a gorilla.

4324
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:37,400
It's a weird how when the
Canadians are good at Muay Thai,

4325
01:59:37,401 --> 01:59:38,240
they were really good.

4326
01:59:38,290 --> 01:59:39,123
Yeah.

4327
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:44,560
Like I just feel like there's not going
to be Thai people or really good Thai

4328
01:59:44,901 --> 01:59:45,351
fighters.

4329
01:59:45,351 --> 01:59:45,720
They didn't

4330
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,160
in Canada because it's cold.

4331
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:48,420
Who wants to go there?

4332
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:50,370
I miss some really,

4333
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:51,413
really good,

4334
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:55,940
no serious Mexicans in Canada

4335
01:59:57,610 --> 01:59:58,500
go where they can make,

4336
01:59:58,580 --> 01:59:59,580
make it to Canada.

4337
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,170
We were talking about this Jamaican Gins

4338
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:02,760
in Canada that was shocked.

4339
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,120
I remember when I fought Simon,

4340
02:00:04,930 --> 02:00:05,763
we had a,

4341
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:06,790
it was like the most,

4342
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:08,013
uh,

4343
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:12,190
talked about fight Muy Thai fight
in the u s pretty sure it still is.

4344
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:12,551
And,

4345
02:00:12,551 --> 02:00:13,384
uh,

4346
02:00:13,570 --> 02:00:15,850
we both started sending
these videos back and forth,

4347
02:00:15,851 --> 02:00:20,620
like talking shit and like really loose
is the first Conor Mcgregor Chell son

4348
02:00:20,621 --> 02:00:22,120
and type thing that anybody had done.

4349
02:00:22,150 --> 02:00:23,590
And it was a big part of my career.

4350
02:00:23,650 --> 02:00:23,891
And,

4351
02:00:23,891 --> 02:00:24,724
uh,

4352
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:26,530
we sold out the hard rocket,

4353
02:00:26,531 --> 02:00:28,180
the lion fight,

4354
02:00:28,181 --> 02:00:30,430
which was like a lion fights biggest,

4355
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:31,264
uh,

4356
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:34,450
gates or whatever had been all three
of my fights and two of them were with

4357
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:35,613
Simon.

4358
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,960
So we're talking shit
back and forth and uh,

4359
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:40,690
he's like speaks with
like a Jamaican accent.

4360
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:44,530
But I think thinking he's Canadian and
I'm like all us with fake motherfucker,

4361
02:00:44,531 --> 02:00:45,820
like all your like have,

4362
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:46,211
you know,

4363
02:00:46,211 --> 02:00:47,860
faker accent,

4364
02:00:47,861 --> 02:00:48,694
blah blah blah.

4365
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:49,991
And I'm like,

4366
02:00:49,991 --> 02:00:50,201
what?

4367
02:00:50,201 --> 02:00:52,480
You're one of like two
Jamaican people in Canada.

4368
02:00:52,481 --> 02:00:54,040
And apparently there's a huge

4369
02:00:54,770 --> 02:00:55,850
Jamaican to me.

4370
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:57,380
I had no idea.

4371
02:00:58,070 --> 02:01:00,030
Not as a lot of Bahamians and Canada.

4372
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:01,130
I have no idea.

4373
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:03,260
So the Commonwealth nations,

4374
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:06,680
The Bahamas is a Commonwealth
nation and most of the Caribbean is,

4375
02:01:07,430 --> 02:01:09,560
but I can move to Canada right now.

4376
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:10,101
Oh,

4377
02:01:10,101 --> 02:01:10,730
that's cool.

4378
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:11,300
You know,

4379
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:11,720
I can,

4380
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:12,230
I can move to,

4381
02:01:12,230 --> 02:01:12,470
can,

4382
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:14,410
I can live there for a long time without,

4383
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:17,900
I still would have to get
citizenship or get paperwork done.

4384
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:21,080
But like when the UFC goes to Canada
and everybody has to get a visa,

4385
02:01:21,081 --> 02:01:21,621
things like that.

4386
02:01:21,621 --> 02:01:22,454
I don't have to do that.

4387
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:23,473
Huh.

4388
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:25,183
Interesting.

4389
02:01:25,370 --> 02:01:26,510
I can just go there and work.

4390
02:01:26,690 --> 02:01:27,523
That's interesting.

4391
02:01:28,730 --> 02:01:29,540
But do you have units?

4392
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:30,440
US citizenship.

4393
02:01:31,670 --> 02:01:32,540
You have a green card?

4394
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:33,393
Yes.

4395
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:35,510
So they can kick you out of
America if you don't like,

4396
02:01:35,511 --> 02:01:37,400
if you talk shit about Donald
Trump or something like that.

4397
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:37,821
Yeah,

4398
02:01:37,821 --> 02:01:38,654
they could

4399
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,190
get out of our country.

4400
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:44,660
You don't like our new king?

4401
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,350
He's pretty fucking close
to being the new tank too.

4402
02:01:48,351 --> 02:01:48,831
That's so,

4403
02:01:48,831 --> 02:01:49,664
so scary.

4404
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:50,720
Just a couple,

4405
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:52,100
couple of Wiki leaks.

4406
02:01:52,470 --> 02:01:53,870
Couple of wikileaks dumps.

4407
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:58,250
I reveal more shit about Hillary
Clinton people jump ship.

4408
02:01:58,370 --> 02:01:59,260
So I taught,

4409
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:01,040
I do a podcast,

4410
02:02:01,041 --> 02:02:02,660
I'm sure dog and um,

4411
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:04,380
I did one with Nick Lancey.

4412
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:06,650
Did you call them plug
on the neutral corner?

4413
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:10,550
So I did one with Nick Lens and lenses is,

4414
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,140
he's all about um,

4415
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:15,200
what do you call it about Donald Trump?

4416
02:02:15,270 --> 02:02:16,071
Nick Lenses.

4417
02:02:16,071 --> 02:02:16,490
Yeah.

4418
02:02:16,490 --> 02:02:16,940
Really?

4419
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:17,271
Yeah.

4420
02:02:17,271 --> 02:02:20,150
It's all he loves Donald
Trump not lead us in love.

4421
02:02:20,151 --> 02:02:20,631
Donald Trump.

4422
02:02:20,631 --> 02:02:21,710
He's not like Donald Trump.

4423
02:02:21,711 --> 02:02:22,490
Yay.

4424
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:27,440
But he's so anti Hillary that he's like
Donald Trump and this guy's fighting the

4425
02:02:27,441 --> 02:02:28,250
establishment.

4426
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:28,820
Uh,

4427
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:29,490
that's where we,

4428
02:02:29,490 --> 02:02:30,323
that's the way to go.

4429
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:32,300
It's hard not to feel that way.

4430
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:32,631
I mean,

4431
02:02:32,631 --> 02:02:35,930
although I think I'm just going to
write in Bernie to be honest with you.

4432
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:37,551
Yeah.

4433
02:02:37,551 --> 02:02:38,171
I think I'm,

4434
02:02:38,171 --> 02:02:39,170
I don't even know if it's going to count,

4435
02:02:39,171 --> 02:02:40,640
but I was still rather write in Bernie.

4436
02:02:41,150 --> 02:02:43,670
I was talking to my friends
about this and it's because

4437
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:45,740
I don't,

4438
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:47,360
I fucking hate both of them,

4439
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:49,250
but I can't figure out
which one I hate more.

4440
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,600
And if I did fera which one?

4441
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:51,200
Eight or more.

4442
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:52,400
I don't trust that one.

4443
02:02:52,401 --> 02:02:54,530
Not to make me regret
voting for them either way.

4444
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:54,880
Right.

4445
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:55,680
I mean,

4446
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:56,780
I think you're screwed either way.

4447
02:02:57,050 --> 02:02:57,410
Well,

4448
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:59,840
it's such a problem having someone,

4449
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:01,220
either one of them,

4450
02:03:01,221 --> 02:03:01,490
right.

4451
02:03:01,490 --> 02:03:02,360
It is a problem,

4452
02:03:02,361 --> 02:03:07,040
but it's a problem having someone
who is outside of the system,

4453
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:10,460
they'd have to step inside of the
system and try to figure out how to make

4454
02:03:10,461 --> 02:03:11,294
things happen.

4455
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:12,770
Like I wonder how much,

4456
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:15,470
it would be interesting to
see if Donald Trump won,

4457
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:20,560
just based on what happens when someone's
a complete political outsider and they

4458
02:03:20,811 --> 02:03:22,700
get to a position where
they're running for president.

4459
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:24,230
Like Obama was an insider.

4460
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:26,810
He had already been deeply
entrenched in the system.

4461
02:03:26,811 --> 02:03:28,460
Hillary's obviously an insider.

4462
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:30,320
What the fuck would have happened,

4463
02:03:30,630 --> 02:03:31,050
you know,

4464
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:32,300
Bernie Sanders got in.

4465
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:32,951
What,

4466
02:03:32,951 --> 02:03:37,430
what would happen if Donald Trump
gets in if someone who's really pretty

4467
02:03:37,431 --> 02:03:38,264
independent,

4468
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,553
you know?

4469
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:40,701
Yeah.

4470
02:03:40,701 --> 02:03:41,050
It's,

4471
02:03:41,050 --> 02:03:44,350
it's one of those things you
have no idea because it's,

4472
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:46,580
is the Senate and the congress
going to stand behind them

4473
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:49,970
also be able to pass laws.

4474
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:51,200
Trump says crazy shit.

4475
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:52,460
You know what I mean?

4476
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:52,881
He's,

4477
02:03:52,881 --> 02:03:56,480
he says so much shit about like what he
would do if like he was president and

4478
02:03:56,481 --> 02:03:57,410
Hillary be in jail.

4479
02:03:57,411 --> 02:03:58,500
Like it's like you can't,

4480
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:01,520
like you're not the law.

4481
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:03,470
Like you can't just lock her up man.

4482
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:06,560
Like there's a reason why we
have this whole system in place.

4483
02:04:06,561 --> 02:04:09,230
Like you can't just circumvent
that and now that you're the king,

4484
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:10,970
like it doesn't give you ultimate power.

4485
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:15,970
But his perception of it or the way he
talks about it is that if he got in he

4486
02:04:16,131 --> 02:04:19,360
would have that ultimate
power since disturbance.

4487
02:04:19,390 --> 02:04:24,290
It is disturbing but it's more disturbing
to me because you see guys like Rudy

4488
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:27,290
Giuliani and he supported this bill to
get people that are on the terrorist

4489
02:04:27,291 --> 02:04:29,690
watch list to have to
wear ankle bracelets.

4490
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:30,680
Right,

4491
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:32,720
so you didn't commit a crime,

4492
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:34,190
you're just on a watch list,

4493
02:04:34,490 --> 02:04:36,530
but you are being treated like prisoner.

4494
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:39,180
Rudy Giuliani is was trying,

4495
02:04:39,181 --> 02:04:40,170
I don't know if he's still,

4496
02:04:40,171 --> 02:04:42,060
if that bill is still
trying to push forward,

4497
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:45,930
but Rudy Giuliani was trying to push this
thing forward a couple of months ago.

4498
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:50,570
What exactly is the fucking terrorist
watch list and like how crazy is,

4499
02:04:50,590 --> 02:04:54,390
they have a list and you're on the list,

4500
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:56,040
but you're not totally a criminal,

4501
02:04:56,041 --> 02:04:58,080
but we think he might
be a fucking criminal.

4502
02:04:58,320 --> 02:04:59,153
So we're going to put up,

4503
02:04:59,170 --> 02:05:00,180
we're going to write you down.

4504
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:03,960
You're on the naughty list
and San is not happy with you.

4505
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:09,570
You kick off a plane and you're going to
get out on the fucking terrorist watch

4506
02:05:09,571 --> 02:05:10,620
list or you can,

4507
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:10,910
if,

4508
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:11,341
if you,

4509
02:05:11,341 --> 02:05:15,330
if you go and you look at the terrorist
watch lists and you read the names that

4510
02:05:15,331 --> 02:05:16,140
are on there,

4511
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:17,220
by the time you get to the end,

4512
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:18,300
your name should be on there.

4513
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:19,260
That's,

4514
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:19,561
that's,

4515
02:05:19,561 --> 02:05:19,861
that's,

4516
02:05:19,861 --> 02:05:20,191
that's,

4517
02:05:20,191 --> 02:05:21,790
I mean that's how they'd work.

4518
02:05:21,791 --> 02:05:23,880
The is why anybody can be on there.

4519
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:25,650
Well there's probably a
while it was on there.

4520
02:05:25,690 --> 02:05:26,450
Yeah.

4521
02:05:26,450 --> 02:05:27,090
Yeah,

4522
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:28,500
because his name is Mohammed Law.

4523
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:29,340
Yeah.

4524
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:30,173
King Mo.

4525
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:32,213
Yeah.

4526
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:33,430
Well there was a,

4527
02:05:33,431 --> 02:05:37,620
a woman I believe who was our Green
Party candidate who was on the terrorist

4528
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:40,590
watch list or at least she
was on the no fly list.

4529
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:41,851
Yeah,

4530
02:05:41,851 --> 02:05:42,270
the don't,

4531
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:43,740
the no fly list is funky.

4532
02:05:43,741 --> 02:05:45,840
Like they just put you on the no fly list.

4533
02:05:46,350 --> 02:05:46,531
Like,

4534
02:05:46,531 --> 02:05:47,490
Hey,

4535
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:48,383
wait a minute.

4536
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:49,830
I can't fly,

4537
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:51,390
but I can take buses.

4538
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:54,420
What can I get on a train?

4539
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:57,030
What about about can I get on a boat?

4540
02:05:57,150 --> 02:05:58,080
Can I find myself?

4541
02:05:58,110 --> 02:05:59,280
Can I go out in public?

4542
02:05:59,340 --> 02:05:59,820
Yeah.

4543
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:02,130
What the fuck is that a no fly list?

4544
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:03,300
Hold on man.

4545
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:06,000
Like if you're not going to
arrest someone for something,

4546
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:09,000
like how the fuck can you
keep them from going places?

4547
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:10,890
You can keep him from flying.

4548
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:13,670
That seems so is it.

4549
02:06:13,671 --> 02:06:14,031
Hears it.

4550
02:06:14,031 --> 02:06:16,740
You can't fly because we are afraid you're
not going to come back or like you're

4551
02:06:16,741 --> 02:06:19,610
like a no blame when they're on it.

4552
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:20,553
Yeah.

4553
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:23,160
Well planes are connected to terror,

4554
02:06:23,161 --> 02:06:23,550
right?

4555
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:26,790
Especially now because of nine 11 yup.

4556
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:27,571
They're just,

4557
02:06:27,571 --> 02:06:29,440
you can't break them away from terrorists,

4558
02:06:29,441 --> 02:06:30,360
planes and terror.

4559
02:06:30,361 --> 02:06:31,380
They go hand in hand.

4560
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:34,200
One of the ways to stop
live stream has ended.

4561
02:06:34,201 --> 02:06:35,310
Thank you for watching.

4562
02:06:36,070 --> 02:06:36,903
What?

4563
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:39,700
How's that possible main events,

4564
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:41,800
but just start at uh,

4565
02:06:41,830 --> 02:06:43,750
six and 15 minutes.

4566
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:44,610
Oh,

4567
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:48,240
is that on this or did we sit through the,

4568
02:06:48,250 --> 02:06:49,350
that was at the prelims.

4569
02:06:49,351 --> 02:06:49,560
Yes.

4570
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:50,610
It's like a super fight series.

4571
02:06:50,611 --> 02:06:51,444
What they called it.

4572
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:51,631
Oh,

4573
02:06:51,631 --> 02:06:54,510
so there's another thing for
four more fights I think.

4574
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:55,530
Oh my goodness.

4575
02:06:56,190 --> 02:06:56,551
I know.

4576
02:06:56,551 --> 02:06:57,210
I was like,

4577
02:06:57,210 --> 02:06:59,250
I game broadcast on ESPN three,

4578
02:06:59,251 --> 02:07:00,480
which is like the Internet thing.

4579
02:07:00,570 --> 02:07:02,400
So can we watch this on here too?

4580
02:07:02,401 --> 02:07:02,870
It should be.

4581
02:07:02,870 --> 02:07:03,703
I'm pretty sure.

4582
02:07:04,470 --> 02:07:05,101
Oh No,

4583
02:07:05,101 --> 02:07:06,120
I bet it'd be on here.

4584
02:07:06,590 --> 02:07:07,580
We still got 10 minutes,

4585
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:12,010
but I don't think we have
ESPN three dude doing,

4586
02:07:12,220 --> 02:07:14,230
we can get their web,

4587
02:07:14,350 --> 02:07:15,760
their web thinks if you have ESPN,

4588
02:07:15,761 --> 02:07:17,230
you can just get it on online.

4589
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:18,153
Oh,

4590
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:19,113
uh,

4591
02:07:20,150 --> 02:07:22,280
Vargas corners stopped at between rounds.

4592
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:25,660
Thanks for bringing that up.

4593
02:07:27,010 --> 02:07:27,431
Okay.

4594
02:07:27,431 --> 02:07:31,390
It says Varga versus then rue
Smolen but it doesn't say,

4595
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,650
it doesn't say anything else.

4596
02:07:35,750 --> 02:07:36,360
Oh Man.

4597
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:37,160
Yeah.

4598
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,050
Main event is on ESPN three.

4599
02:07:39,140 --> 02:07:39,710
Okay.

4600
02:07:39,710 --> 02:07:40,670
How do we do that?

4601
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:41,533
Can you do that?

4602
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:44,760
Can you do that for us?

4603
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:45,720
Yeah,

4604
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:46,573
I think so.

4605
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:47,633
Beautiful.

4606
02:07:48,530 --> 02:07:48,801
Oh,

4607
02:07:48,801 --> 02:07:49,850
that's interesting man.

4608
02:07:49,851 --> 02:07:52,640
So essentially it's just like the UFC.

4609
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:54,120
The UFC has those uh,

4610
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:56,810
uh,

4611
02:07:56,810 --> 02:08:01,810
fs one and reclaimed pass ones and they
have the fs one fights just like that.

4612
02:08:02,150 --> 02:08:03,260
So it's just the prelims.

4613
02:08:03,650 --> 02:08:04,670
Let me see that.

4614
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:09,221
Oh boy.

4615
02:08:09,221 --> 02:08:10,300
Young Jarem.

4616
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:11,830
He's going to sort it.

4617
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:12,730
Oh,

4618
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:13,690
Eve Edwards.

4619
02:08:13,690 --> 02:08:15,040
You're really good analyst.

4620
02:08:15,130 --> 02:08:15,851
I just want to tell you,

4621
02:08:15,851 --> 02:08:18,100
I really enjoy your analysis.

4622
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:19,360
Your grade on the mic,

4623
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:20,111
your,

4624
02:08:20,111 --> 02:08:20,620
uh,

4625
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:21,071
you're,

4626
02:08:21,071 --> 02:08:24,430
you're really humble for a guy who
fought as much as you fought to.

4627
02:08:24,431 --> 02:08:26,260
You don't bring yourself into it too much.

4628
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:27,251
And if you do,

4629
02:08:27,251 --> 02:08:29,350
it's like really succinct and important.

4630
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:31,180
Like you do an awesome job.

4631
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:32,380
Thank you man.

4632
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:32,711
I was,

4633
02:08:32,711 --> 02:08:33,430
um,

4634
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:37,360
I was going to try to not be humble
when you said that something smart ass,

4635
02:08:37,361 --> 02:08:38,194
but I couldn't

4636
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:41,420
blow it away for you by you
saying that to thank you.

4637
02:08:41,450 --> 02:08:42,310
Really good man.

4638
02:08:42,580 --> 02:08:44,100
You have a real good insight too.

4639
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:44,440
You know,

4640
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:45,011
you're obviously,

4641
02:08:45,011 --> 02:08:47,260
you were very intelligent
fighter when you're competing,

4642
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:49,090
you are very creative and you know,

4643
02:08:49,091 --> 02:08:50,350
you had a very,

4644
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:50,761
uh,

4645
02:08:50,761 --> 02:08:51,490
a good,

4646
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:51,701
uh,

4647
02:08:51,701 --> 02:08:53,140
high fight Iq.

4648
02:08:53,141 --> 02:08:55,480
You're very aware of what's
going on in at any point in time.

4649
02:08:55,740 --> 02:09:00,740
I think that that intelligence style of
a you're fighting makes for really good

4650
02:09:01,061 --> 02:09:02,920
analyst because you,

4651
02:09:02,921 --> 02:09:03,340
uh,

4652
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:04,173
you're not,

4653
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:05,040
you know,

4654
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:09,370
you weren't a guy who tried to overwhelm
anybody with power or aggression or

4655
02:09:09,371 --> 02:09:09,510
any,

4656
02:09:09,510 --> 02:09:09,691
you,

4657
02:09:09,691 --> 02:09:10,011
you were,

4658
02:09:10,011 --> 02:09:14,500
you was laying traps and setting people
up and using really clean technique.

4659
02:09:14,740 --> 02:09:15,880
And I find,

4660
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:16,631
you know,

4661
02:09:16,631 --> 02:09:17,141
like I said,

4662
02:09:17,141 --> 02:09:19,660
Vandelay probably one of my all time
favorite guys to watch because you see

4663
02:09:19,661 --> 02:09:20,770
what's pure chaos.

4664
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:26,220
But I find that people like yourself
oftentimes make really good analysts

4665
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:31,830
because like you're a guy who was like
looking at fighting at whether it's MMA,

4666
02:09:32,111 --> 02:09:33,520
stand up on the ground,

4667
02:09:33,521 --> 02:09:34,354
whatever it was,

4668
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:38,440
you're looking at it at
this very analytical level.

4669
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:43,390
It's for me it's like asking questions
and that's one of my boxing coaches.

4670
02:09:43,391 --> 02:09:46,600
Kenny Weldon used to say that when
I fought Aaron the second time,

4671
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:49,330
he watched the fight after
the fact and he was like,

4672
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:50,291
I was like,

4673
02:09:50,291 --> 02:09:51,260
so what do you think Kenny?

4674
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:51,940
He goes,

4675
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:53,740
that kid has a lot of questions.

4676
02:09:54,190 --> 02:09:54,551
It's like,

4677
02:09:54,551 --> 02:09:54,971
what do you mean?

4678
02:09:54,971 --> 02:09:55,840
He has a lot of questions.

4679
02:09:55,841 --> 02:09:56,380
He's like,

4680
02:09:56,380 --> 02:10:00,490
every time you do something you're asking
them a question and then I'm sorry,

4681
02:10:00,491 --> 02:10:03,600
every time he does something he's asking
you a question and you're answering him

4682
02:10:03,601 --> 02:10:04,330
with like,

4683
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:07,180
I'm going to do this and what are
you going to do about what I'm doing?

4684
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:08,530
And he's just asking me,

4685
02:10:08,531 --> 02:10:09,400
why are you doing that?

4686
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:10,300
Why are you doing that?

4687
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:10,961
So he's like,

4688
02:10:10,961 --> 02:10:14,260
he's saying he's asking all the
questions but he has no answers.

4689
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:16,120
So he's asking me questions.

4690
02:10:16,121 --> 02:10:18,160
I've been giving him matches and um,

4691
02:10:18,730 --> 02:10:22,090
I think that's Kinda how I
watched fights or how I fought.

4692
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:24,850
I would try to do something and see
what you're doing because of that.

4693
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:27,430
You kind of play with
that and feel it and,

4694
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:29,410
and that's how I watch
other people fly to watch.

4695
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:30,460
When I watch guys fight,

4696
02:10:30,461 --> 02:10:30,791
I'm like,

4697
02:10:30,791 --> 02:10:31,511
what is he doing?

4698
02:10:31,511 --> 02:10:32,470
Why is he doing that?

4699
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:33,800
Is he trying to set something up?

4700
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:35,060
This guy going to Rhea,

4701
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:36,380
how's that guy going to react to that?

4702
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:37,820
What's he going to do about him?

4703
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:40,250
What's he going to do about his strengths?

4704
02:10:40,251 --> 02:10:41,960
He knows he's coming in
with these strengths,

4705
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:43,820
so how's he going to try
and take those things away?

4706
02:10:44,030 --> 02:10:46,340
Or has he just gonna try to
impose his own strengths?

4707
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:47,213
I,

4708
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:47,931
for me,

4709
02:10:47,931 --> 02:10:49,280
that's what fighting is.

4710
02:10:49,281 --> 02:10:54,281
It's be making yourself as comfortable
as you can be at all times while making

4711
02:10:55,101 --> 02:10:57,080
the other guy as
uncomfortable as he can be.

4712
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:58,401
For me.

4713
02:10:58,401 --> 02:10:58,961
That's what I,

4714
02:10:58,961 --> 02:11:02,690
I tried to look at and I try
to see if guys play like that.

4715
02:11:02,691 --> 02:11:02,980
How,

4716
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:04,400
how are they going to play that game?

4717
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:06,081
Yeah,

4718
02:11:06,081 --> 02:11:11,081
that completely makes sense that you
have that kind of style without approach.

4719
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:12,740
You know,

4720
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:17,060
I just always admired the
way you would set things up.

4721
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:19,930
You always had a real
technical style fund,

4722
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:20,590
which I mean,

4723
02:11:20,590 --> 02:11:21,140
like I said,

4724
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:22,490
I admire chaos to,

4725
02:11:22,491 --> 02:11:24,530
I admire those Melvin Manhoef dudes too.

4726
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:25,261
You know,

4727
02:11:25,261 --> 02:11:25,550
and my,

4728
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:29,960
I admire a Vandelay like maybe more than
anybody just because he was so wild to

4729
02:11:29,961 --> 02:11:30,794
watch.

4730
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:31,491
But,

4731
02:11:31,491 --> 02:11:31,790
um,

4732
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:32,180
I found,

4733
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:35,750
I find that for analysis like Dominick
Cruz is another guy I think knocks it out

4734
02:11:35,751 --> 02:11:37,880
of the park because he's so,

4735
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:42,970
he's so smart and his assessment of risk
and reward and putting yourself in a

4736
02:11:43,851 --> 02:11:47,120
position where your opponent doesn't
exactly know what you're going to do,

4737
02:11:47,121 --> 02:11:49,540
but you know how he's
gonna react because you're,

4738
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:53,480
you have this awkward style that you've
seen other people react to for a long

4739
02:11:53,481 --> 02:11:54,230
time.

4740
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:56,630
But for them it's like this new thing.

4741
02:11:56,810 --> 02:11:59,240
They're standing in front of this
guy who was switching stances.

4742
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:02,060
And bouncing and moving up
and down and back and forth.

4743
02:12:02,061 --> 02:12:05,180
And you're not exactly sure
what the fuck he's doing,

4744
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:06,950
but he knows what you're going to do.

4745
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:07,310
Yeah.

4746
02:12:07,310 --> 02:12:09,320
Because he's so used to
doing it to regular people,

4747
02:12:09,321 --> 02:12:10,580
like everybody who stands like,

4748
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:11,241
you know,

4749
02:12:11,241 --> 02:12:14,630
like certain guys that have that
like Moy Thai style and God,

4750
02:12:14,631 --> 02:12:14,980
they're getting,

4751
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:18,950
there's so much that they're
giving a guy in that situation.

4752
02:12:19,190 --> 02:12:21,170
And when you've got a
guy like Dominick Cruz,

4753
02:12:21,171 --> 02:12:23,390
like he's not predictable at all.

4754
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:28,100
He's like flipping stances and moving
around and throwing punches from these

4755
02:12:28,101 --> 02:12:31,940
weird fucking angles where you
would swear he's doing it wrong.

4756
02:12:32,090 --> 02:12:32,630
Right.

4757
02:12:32,630 --> 02:12:33,140
Yeah.

4758
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:34,670
It's for me,

4759
02:12:34,671 --> 02:12:38,450
I always look at the way someone explained
something to me is as the easiest way

4760
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:41,000
to explain it and bad ass grin.

4761
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:43,640
Tyron said Ben Likes to cause scrambles,

4762
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:44,570
right?

4763
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:45,620
That's what dom does.

4764
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:46,010
Yeah.

4765
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:48,500
He's causing scrambles
on the feet cause he's,

4766
02:12:48,680 --> 02:12:50,480
he's not in a traditional position.

4767
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:50,901
He's not,

4768
02:12:50,901 --> 02:12:53,300
and he's not coming at you
like everybody else does.

4769
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:57,350
So what he's doing is initiating
a scramble right away when you're,

4770
02:12:57,390 --> 02:12:58,580
when you get a guy on top of you,

4771
02:12:58,581 --> 02:13:01,550
like Rda and he's good
at establishing position.

4772
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:03,500
If you can create a scramble,

4773
02:13:03,740 --> 02:13:05,600
then you have a better
chance of getting out.

4774
02:13:05,630 --> 02:13:10,010
Then if you that if you just try to
use basic technique and Dominic is

4775
02:13:10,011 --> 02:13:11,300
comfortable in those scrambles,

4776
02:13:11,301 --> 02:13:11,930
he,

4777
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:13,670
he's been in them so many times.

4778
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:16,850
When you react you have like
three or four reactions.

4779
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:18,350
But he has like 22.

4780
02:13:18,710 --> 02:13:19,543
Wow.

4781
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:20,720
Damn.

4782
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:20,931
You know,

4783
02:13:20,931 --> 02:13:22,070
he did a great breakdown.

4784
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:25,490
A charac from the
underground cure genesis.

4785
02:13:25,610 --> 02:13:26,120
Yeah.

4786
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:26,840
He uh,

4787
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:29,150
see if he could find
that he put it up today.

4788
02:13:30,230 --> 02:13:31,063
He put up a,

4789
02:13:31,070 --> 02:13:32,160
an article

4790
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:37,020
breaking down all the variables
of Dominick Cruz's footwork.

4791
02:13:37,830 --> 02:13:40,050
Really interesting
stuff because you don't,

4792
02:13:40,051 --> 02:13:41,750
until you see it as a list,

4793
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:43,830
like all the different things he does.

4794
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:45,720
And Keurig did an awesome job of,

4795
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:50,400
of just sort of a breaking down all the
different things in his fights and it

4796
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:51,480
just makes you realize like,

4797
02:13:51,481 --> 02:13:51,811
wow,

4798
02:13:51,811 --> 02:13:53,980
that guy's got a lot of options man.

4799
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:55,171
Like someone was,

4800
02:13:55,171 --> 02:13:57,780
I think it was Ludwig was saying that
he doesn't think he has good technique.

4801
02:13:57,781 --> 02:13:58,160
A blanket.

4802
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,250
How can you say that though?

4803
02:13:59,251 --> 02:14:00,840
Cause you land so many punches.

4804
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,130
Like how can you say it?

4805
02:14:02,131 --> 02:14:04,440
Like it might not look
like everybody else's,

4806
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:06,510
but God damn it's working.

4807
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:07,110
Oh,

4808
02:14:07,110 --> 02:14:07,711
I mean it works.

4809
02:14:07,711 --> 02:14:09,420
It's crazy how effective it is.

4810
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:10,830
See this is all the stuff that,

4811
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:12,570
that Kirk wrote down,

4812
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:14,790
all the different stuff that Dominic does.

4813
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:17,941
Pretty interesting,

4814
02:14:17,941 --> 02:14:18,300
right?

4815
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:19,133
Yup.

4816
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:22,260
A neo footwork is what
people are calling it,

4817
02:14:22,261 --> 02:14:23,094
right?

4818
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:25,410
It's like a Tj Dillashaw style.

4819
02:14:25,411 --> 02:14:27,090
He's got a very interesting style too.

4820
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:28,410
And uh,

4821
02:14:28,410 --> 02:14:29,243
I uh,

4822
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:31,440
I hit pads with Dwayne recently.

4823
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:33,690
Dwayne showed me some stuff and
one of the things he's doing,

4824
02:14:33,691 --> 02:14:33,871
his all,

4825
02:14:33,871 --> 02:14:35,400
he's switched stances.

4826
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:36,870
He's doing like these,

4827
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:40,050
you're switching and throwing
punches as you're switching.

4828
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:44,790
He's got a lot of this switch stance
stuff that he's Rick really incorporating

4829
02:14:44,791 --> 02:14:45,750
into these combinations.

4830
02:14:45,751 --> 02:14:47,310
And you see it a lot from TJ.

4831
02:14:47,670 --> 02:14:50,280
I mean Tj is as comfortable
from a south paws.

4832
02:14:50,281 --> 02:14:54,510
He is from an Orthodox and he's
doing a lot of these switch moves.

4833
02:14:54,511 --> 02:14:54,861
Like they're,

4834
02:14:54,861 --> 02:14:57,600
they're hitting pads with these
and they're very confused.

4835
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,393
You know?

4836
02:14:59,950 --> 02:15:01,150
So remember when,

4837
02:15:01,151 --> 02:15:03,220
when I said I don't like that style,

4838
02:15:03,221 --> 02:15:07,450
that Geeky pseudo style
because not because,

4839
02:15:07,451 --> 02:15:08,890
but Dominic style,

4840
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:11,590
that style I think is
the style to beat that.

4841
02:15:12,190 --> 02:15:16,360
The reason I say that is because
the way Dominic is approaching it,

4842
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:20,500
he's approaching it from a educated,

4843
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,480
I would say more educated,

4844
02:15:22,690 --> 02:15:25,120
more studious place.

4845
02:15:25,230 --> 02:15:25,720
Mm.

4846
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:30,580
These guys are approaching it from
trying to get you to buy the wolf ticket.

4847
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:31,780
Ah.

4848
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:32,230
You know,

4849
02:15:32,230 --> 02:15:32,621
so they're,

4850
02:15:32,621 --> 02:15:37,090
they're giving you these weird looks
because that's going to make you get off

4851
02:15:37,091 --> 02:15:37,511
balance,

4852
02:15:37,511 --> 02:15:38,710
get stand there for them.

4853
02:15:38,711 --> 02:15:40,300
Be The guy that's just a target.

4854
02:15:40,660 --> 02:15:44,350
But dom is giving you these looks
from a fighting perspective.

4855
02:15:44,351 --> 02:15:47,320
He's always in position
to fight those guys.

4856
02:15:47,321 --> 02:15:47,711
When you're,

4857
02:15:47,711 --> 02:15:48,610
when you break dancing,

4858
02:15:48,611 --> 02:15:50,140
sometimes you're not in position to react.

4859
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:55,120
Dom is always in position to react and
that's why I think that style is the

4860
02:15:55,121 --> 02:15:58,120
style that beats the other
style 10 out of 10 times.

4861
02:15:58,780 --> 02:16:03,070
What's really interesting is I don't
recall anybody before Dominick Cruz doing

4862
02:16:03,071 --> 02:16:03,904
it like that.

4863
02:16:04,450 --> 02:16:06,400
I really don't it,

4864
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:07,840
it's a lot of what,

4865
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:08,860
I mean it's limited,

4866
02:16:08,890 --> 02:16:12,100
but Muhammad Ali did a lot of
things like that with his boxing,

4867
02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:13,010
you know?

4868
02:16:13,010 --> 02:16:13,690
Yeah.

4869
02:16:13,690 --> 02:16:16,360
The rope a dope and his
footwork that that's,

4870
02:16:16,361 --> 02:16:17,171
that's a part of it.

4871
02:16:17,171 --> 02:16:18,520
That's a part of what dom does.

4872
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:20,290
Dom does it for MMA,

4873
02:16:20,350 --> 02:16:23,620
so he has to be aware of the
kicks tie ups and clinches.

4874
02:16:23,950 --> 02:16:24,251
I mean,

4875
02:16:24,251 --> 02:16:26,740
how many times you see guys
press dom on the fence?

4876
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:27,550
Yeah.

4877
02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:28,383
Almost never.

4878
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:29,110
Never.

4879
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:31,120
Very rarely do you know,

4880
02:16:31,121 --> 02:16:31,360
the,

4881
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,490
the real super fight is
him and mighty mouse.

4882
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:34,750
That's the real super fight.

4883
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:36,100
Yeah.

4884
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:38,890
But I mean we saw that you did see it,

4885
02:16:38,891 --> 02:16:39,724
but we saw it.

4886
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:42,310
I think mighty mouse is far better.

4887
02:16:42,640 --> 02:16:43,150
Yeah,

4888
02:16:43,150 --> 02:16:43,780
I really do.

4889
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:44,860
But he's so much smaller,

4890
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:48,460
so much smaller as fact is a fact.

4891
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:48,911
I mean,

4892
02:16:48,911 --> 02:16:51,700
he's got to be comfortable fighting one
35 when he was always so much smaller

4893
02:16:51,701 --> 02:16:53,110
than those one 35 pound guys.

4894
02:16:53,111 --> 02:16:55,570
But from the,

4895
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:55,841
uh,

4896
02:16:55,841 --> 02:17:00,490
I think it was the Ian Mccall fight
on when Ian Mccall took his back and

4897
02:17:00,491 --> 02:17:01,324
battered him.

4898
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:03,040
He's talked about it.

4899
02:17:03,041 --> 02:17:06,190
Like that was like the big shifting
point where he just realized like,

4900
02:17:06,191 --> 02:17:06,730
um,

4901
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:08,290
that he's really gotta be dedicated.

4902
02:17:08,291 --> 02:17:08,770
He can't,

4903
02:17:08,770 --> 02:17:10,180
he can't fuck this up anymore.

4904
02:17:10,181 --> 02:17:11,710
I can't have a full time job.

4905
02:17:11,711 --> 02:17:13,450
He can't be taken beatings like that.

4906
02:17:13,990 --> 02:17:18,990
And that it was more of the fact that he
wasn't putting the time in versus hip,

4907
02:17:19,931 --> 02:17:22,120
not having the ability to,

4908
02:17:22,121 --> 02:17:23,260
he knew he could fight better than that.

4909
02:17:23,770 --> 02:17:28,600
And so then you see him from
that fight on slowly emerge as,

4910
02:17:29,170 --> 02:17:29,951
I mean at this point,

4911
02:17:29,951 --> 02:17:33,280
pretty much the consensus pound for
pound best fighter in the world.

4912
02:17:33,310 --> 02:17:35,680
Especially now that John
doesn't have a license.

4913
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:38,530
John was the other guy that
was in the mix for that.

4914
02:17:39,010 --> 02:17:41,230
But I think mighty
mouse takes less damage,

4915
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:45,930
is destroying more guys more in more of a,

4916
02:17:45,931 --> 02:17:48,550
a crazy technical impressive fashion.

4917
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:49,571
Like when he stopped,

4918
02:17:49,571 --> 02:17:53,140
so Hutto I mean that
was a work of art man.

4919
02:17:53,170 --> 02:17:55,720
The clinch work and
those knees to the body.

4920
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:58,690
That was as good as I've ever
seen anybody beat anybody.

4921
02:17:59,050 --> 02:17:59,620
You know?

4922
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:00,880
I mean that was his stunning.

4923
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:01,841
Yeah,

4924
02:18:01,841 --> 02:18:02,260
that's,

4925
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:05,670
that's the highest level of mixed
martial arts is defense too.

4926
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:07,000
When he went to the ground.

4927
02:18:07,001 --> 02:18:07,960
So who don't took him to the ground,

4928
02:18:07,961 --> 02:18:09,190
he's got butterflies in,

4929
02:18:09,191 --> 02:18:09,971
he's moving,

4930
02:18:09,971 --> 02:18:11,260
he gets back up to his feet.

4931
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:14,110
I mean some high level shit,

4932
02:18:14,111 --> 02:18:14,250
man.

4933
02:18:14,250 --> 02:18:15,160
He and he and Hertz who,

4934
02:18:15,161 --> 02:18:16,090
who go to the body,

4935
02:18:16,091 --> 02:18:16,481
which is why,

4936
02:18:16,481 --> 02:18:19,240
so who don't took him down super,

4937
02:18:19,241 --> 02:18:20,320
super high level.

4938
02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:20,860
So,

4939
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:21,880
so the reason I,

4940
02:18:21,881 --> 02:18:26,140
the reason I think a guy like that gets
that good especially so quick is because

4941
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:28,720
he doesn't have a favorite part.

4942
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:29,830
He doesn't like,

4943
02:18:29,890 --> 02:18:31,150
he loves the whole thing,

4944
02:18:31,630 --> 02:18:31,931
you know,

4945
02:18:31,931 --> 02:18:32,261
you know,

4946
02:18:32,261 --> 02:18:35,770
you know those guys that they're
good strikers and they love striking.

4947
02:18:35,771 --> 02:18:37,660
So that's what they
want to do all the time.

4948
02:18:38,170 --> 02:18:38,591
Like no,

4949
02:18:38,591 --> 02:18:42,910
he works in everything because for his
offense to be as good and his defense to

4950
02:18:42,911 --> 02:18:44,050
be just as good.

4951
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:46,570
A lot of guys just want to be offensive.

4952
02:18:46,571 --> 02:18:49,330
Guys just want to win in the gym that I
just want to get on top and they want to

4953
02:18:49,331 --> 02:18:50,620
stay there and they want to control.

4954
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:53,080
So when those guys get put on their back,

4955
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:56,860
they don't really know what to do or
they have a much harder time escaping or

4956
02:18:56,861 --> 02:18:58,360
transitioning out of that position.

4957
02:18:58,930 --> 02:19:00,920
But not a guy like that though.

4958
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:02,280
Those are the best guys in the world.

4959
02:19:02,281 --> 02:19:02,801
And you look at,

4960
02:19:02,801 --> 02:19:03,820
you look at Dj,

4961
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:04,720
you look at dom,

4962
02:19:04,930 --> 02:19:06,100
I mean even Connor,

4963
02:19:06,490 --> 02:19:07,000
right?

4964
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:07,833
Um,

4965
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:11,800
the Nate fight is a bad example because
that was the first time he was in a

4966
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:13,320
fight in the UFC and,

4967
02:19:13,321 --> 02:19:15,190
and he didn't like it the
second time he did better.

4968
02:19:15,191 --> 02:19:16,390
But at the same thing with chat,

4969
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:20,410
the little bit of a fight he was in
with Mendez when he was on his back,

4970
02:19:20,530 --> 02:19:21,370
he did some work,

4971
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:22,810
got back to his feet.

4972
02:19:23,050 --> 02:19:23,321
He did.

4973
02:19:23,321 --> 02:19:23,471
He,

4974
02:19:23,471 --> 02:19:26,100
he wasn't so uncomfortable with a,

4975
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:30,260
with a dominant wrestler that on top that
he wasn't going to be able to get back

4976
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:31,094
up.

4977
02:19:31,610 --> 02:19:32,270
Yeah.

4978
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:32,600
Well,

4979
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:33,550
Connor is,

4980
02:19:33,551 --> 02:19:34,970
is definitely evolving.

4981
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:35,500
You know,

4982
02:19:35,500 --> 02:19:35,731
you,

4983
02:19:35,731 --> 02:19:37,130
you could definitely tell that he's,

4984
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:37,780
uh,

4985
02:19:37,780 --> 02:19:41,120
like especially his approach
to the second Nate Diaz fight.

4986
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:42,171
He fought that fight,

4987
02:19:42,171 --> 02:19:43,004
very smart.

4988
02:19:43,370 --> 02:19:47,060
And He survived some moments where
it looks like he was gassing out,

4989
02:19:47,090 --> 02:19:49,520
or at least he got that
opportunity to reset.

4990
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:50,570
If he wasn't gassing out,

4991
02:19:50,571 --> 02:19:51,650
he's definitely diminished.

4992
02:19:52,010 --> 02:19:52,880
But he managed it.

4993
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:56,150
He managed much better than
the first time because I mean,

4994
02:19:56,151 --> 02:19:58,130
when he got in trouble that first time,

4995
02:19:58,610 --> 02:20:00,410
he did try to change the game.

4996
02:20:00,710 --> 02:20:02,960
But when it wasn't in his favor,

4997
02:20:03,170 --> 02:20:03,681
it was like,

4998
02:20:03,681 --> 02:20:05,020
I kind of want out here lady.

4999
02:20:05,080 --> 02:20:05,670
They spear.

5000
02:20:05,670 --> 02:20:06,141
I mean,

5001
02:20:06,141 --> 02:20:06,771
as a fighter,

5002
02:20:06,771 --> 02:20:07,790
I look at that and I'm like,

5003
02:20:08,090 --> 02:20:09,650
his spirit kind of broke there.

5004
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:13,790
But he asked for that fight again and
then he did it again and he did run into

5005
02:20:13,791 --> 02:20:17,900
some trouble and he improved
and he fought through it.

5006
02:20:17,901 --> 02:20:19,330
The second time he didn't,

5007
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:20,091
he wasn't like,

5008
02:20:20,091 --> 02:20:20,241
oh,

5009
02:20:20,241 --> 02:20:21,200
this is a real fight.

5010
02:20:21,201 --> 02:20:22,850
Now I gotta get Outta here.

5011
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:23,121
No,

5012
02:20:23,121 --> 02:20:23,601
he was like,

5013
02:20:23,601 --> 02:20:24,590
I'm staying right here.

5014
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:27,950
So I'm excited to see
that Conor fight Eddie.

5015
02:20:27,951 --> 02:20:29,750
Because I mean,

5016
02:20:29,751 --> 02:20:30,584
yeah,

5017
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:32,600
Nate is the same kind of guy.

5018
02:20:32,601 --> 02:20:34,850
He's not going to worry
about those kinds of things.

5019
02:20:34,851 --> 02:20:37,820
But like Eddie is a different beast.

5020
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:38,990
Eddie's that Philly beast.

5021
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:39,980
He's a savage.

5022
02:20:40,550 --> 02:20:41,271
So I want to see,

5023
02:20:41,271 --> 02:20:45,020
I want to see them get into a fight
like not could easily happen to,

5024
02:20:45,190 --> 02:20:46,160
it could easily happen.

5025
02:20:46,970 --> 02:20:48,560
Eddie Abras the fucking savage.

5026
02:20:49,130 --> 02:20:49,963
He really is.

5027
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:52,180
He watched that Hockfield
Los Angeles stoppage.

5028
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:53,510
Holy Shit.

5029
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:55,490
The combination he hit him with,

5030
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:56,301
I mean,

5031
02:20:56,301 --> 02:20:56,781
and the,

5032
02:20:56,781 --> 02:20:57,200
the,

5033
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:57,740
the,

5034
02:20:57,740 --> 02:21:02,420
the sheer amount of punches he through
the barrage that it took to put them

5035
02:21:02,421 --> 02:21:03,254
away.

5036
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:08,500
I mean he had some fucking serious
endurance to press the pace like that.

5037
02:21:09,530 --> 02:21:11,960
That's the one thing that
Connor has been struggling with,

5038
02:21:11,961 --> 02:21:12,530
right?

5039
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:13,330
Yeah,

5040
02:21:13,330 --> 02:21:13,640
yeah.

5041
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:15,900
With that pace and endurance and,

5042
02:21:15,910 --> 02:21:19,540
and Eddie has the power to
put that pace on him when,

5043
02:21:19,541 --> 02:21:22,760
when Nate gets him tired or
it gets him hurt on his feet,

5044
02:21:23,250 --> 02:21:25,850
he's got that power and not as dynamic.

5045
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:26,510
He's,

5046
02:21:26,510 --> 02:21:28,400
he's a very strong guy too.

5047
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:33,020
Like he's a very strong guy for one
55 I'm looking forward to that too.

5048
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:37,160
I'm curious actually to see what
Connor looks like at 55 because right.

5049
02:21:37,161 --> 02:21:39,140
We haven't seen him there in the UFC.

5050
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:41,240
We've seen 45 and then
you've seen him cut?

5051
02:21:41,241 --> 02:21:45,320
No wait and wait like one 69 I
think he weighed against Nate.

5052
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:50,750
It would be interesting to see what is
Connor look like when he's at one 55?

5053
02:21:50,751 --> 02:21:52,540
I mean that might be the
perfect weight for him.

5054
02:21:52,541 --> 02:21:53,960
It's entirely possible.

5055
02:21:53,961 --> 02:21:56,300
We might see a better McGregor at one 55.

5056
02:21:56,930 --> 02:21:58,790
I think that's the deepest division.

5057
02:21:58,920 --> 02:21:59,570
Yeah,

5058
02:21:59,570 --> 02:22:01,400
I think it has been for the longest time.

5059
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:03,200
And that if,

5060
02:22:03,201 --> 02:22:03,411
if,

5061
02:22:03,411 --> 02:22:05,600
if anybody dominates that division,

5062
02:22:05,870 --> 02:22:07,340
like Rda did it for a little,

5063
02:22:07,341 --> 02:22:09,020
he looked dominant for a little bit.

5064
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:09,860
Um,

5065
02:22:09,860 --> 02:22:11,420
even coming up to the title fight,

5066
02:22:11,450 --> 02:22:13,910
he looked like he was going to
hold on to that for a while.

5067
02:22:14,570 --> 02:22:15,380
Um,

5068
02:22:15,380 --> 02:22:19,400
but everybody there so close
everybody that way class is so close.

5069
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:21,640
So if somebody does it well,

5070
02:22:21,641 --> 02:22:26,280
what about Norma Grumet off because he
ragdolled everybody he's gotten in there

5071
02:22:26,281 --> 02:22:26,610
with,

5072
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:29,540
that's the one guy you can't say
it's close with because everybody,

5073
02:22:29,541 --> 02:22:30,271
he's got a hold of,

5074
02:22:30,271 --> 02:22:33,000
he's beating the fuck out
of that guy is special.

5075
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:33,540
Right?

5076
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:34,980
That's your man off a special.

5077
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:35,873
That's true.

5078
02:22:36,010 --> 02:22:36,843
I like,

5079
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:40,650
I like that guy because
what you said he special.

5080
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:40,980
Right?

5081
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:42,900
And when you see that special thing,

5082
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:47,970
then I guess people kind of get lost in
the void when everybody's close to being

5083
02:22:47,971 --> 02:22:49,200
just as good as each other.

5084
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:52,470
Then you kinda just fight to get just
a little bit better than the other guy,

5085
02:22:52,471 --> 02:22:53,750
just a little bit better than the other.

5086
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:54,990
I just gotta be better than him.

5087
02:22:55,170 --> 02:22:59,040
But then when you get the John Jones
that comes into the arena and he's,

5088
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:01,890
she's leaps and bounds
ahead of everybody else,

5089
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:05,520
then you realize there's a bigger
gap and guys start closing that.

5090
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:06,360
Right.

5091
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:09,000
Like a Alyse Alinka Alexander Gusterson.

5092
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:09,913
I mean,

5093
02:23:10,050 --> 02:23:11,790
he always fights at that level,

5094
02:23:11,791 --> 02:23:13,140
especially when he's in a title fight.

5095
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:14,970
But I don't know if,

5096
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,040
if John Jones didn't exist,

5097
02:23:17,190 --> 02:23:19,170
if he would rise to that occasion.

5098
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:19,800
Hmm.

5099
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:20,633
What I mean,

5100
02:23:21,510 --> 02:23:22,191
he sold.

5101
02:23:22,191 --> 02:23:26,130
So somebody's got to show up
in the lightweight division
at some point like that

5102
02:23:26,370 --> 02:23:26,751
too,

5103
02:23:26,751 --> 02:23:29,250
to make people raise their level.

5104
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:30,780
Because guys right now,

5105
02:23:30,781 --> 02:23:32,790
which is the deepest
and toughest division,

5106
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:36,600
but guys are so close and maybe
no Maga Madoff is that guy.

5107
02:23:37,220 --> 02:23:38,053
Hmm.

5108
02:23:38,270 --> 02:23:38,361
Well,

5109
02:23:38,361 --> 02:23:40,860
he certainly has been in
when it comes to grappling,

5110
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:41,821
like what he did,

5111
02:23:41,821 --> 02:23:43,320
the Dos Anjos was,

5112
02:23:43,330 --> 02:23:44,370
was pretty stunning,

5113
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:45,211
you know,

5114
02:23:45,211 --> 02:23:45,811
because there was like,

5115
02:23:45,811 --> 02:23:46,511
man though Sandra,

5116
02:23:46,511 --> 02:23:49,170
this is a legit Brazilian
Jiu Jitsu black belt,

5117
02:23:49,171 --> 02:23:50,370
super strong guy,

5118
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:53,760
really good on the ground and it
just seemed like number Grumet off.

5119
02:23:53,761 --> 02:23:56,340
Just got ahold of them and just did
whatever the fuck you wanted to.

5120
02:23:56,340 --> 02:23:57,330
Once we got him on the ground,

5121
02:23:57,810 --> 02:23:58,890
just throws dudes around.

5122
02:23:58,891 --> 02:24:00,420
It's almost like he's built different,

5123
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:01,650
but he doesn't,

5124
02:24:01,650 --> 02:24:01,921
you know,

5125
02:24:01,921 --> 02:24:04,770
like if Gleason Tibau
was doing that to dude's,

5126
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:05,341
I'd go,

5127
02:24:05,341 --> 02:24:06,420
I that makes sense.

5128
02:24:06,421 --> 02:24:07,500
Look at that fucking guy.

5129
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:09,210
But when Norma Madoff does it,

5130
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:13,680
it's not necessarily just some
overwhelming physical attribute.

5131
02:24:13,950 --> 02:24:16,320
It's his technique and his aggression.

5132
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:17,430
Just,

5133
02:24:17,430 --> 02:24:21,990
just super fucking aggressive and tight
with his grappling and his positioning

5134
02:24:21,991 --> 02:24:23,880
his ground and pound his horrific.

5135
02:24:24,210 --> 02:24:25,410
He's a scary dude,

5136
02:24:25,411 --> 02:24:26,244
man.

5137
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:27,360
He doesn't,

5138
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:30,030
he doesn't even have to think
about the way he does those moves.

5139
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:33,360
I remember when you said that and when
you say ragdoll on people and Rda,

5140
02:24:33,630 --> 02:24:38,480
Rda took that shot on him and he was
in the third and he hit him with it.

5141
02:24:38,510 --> 02:24:43,020
Uchi Mata basically right from the over
Hook whizzer and tripped him forcing it.

5142
02:24:43,021 --> 02:24:45,030
And that's not easy throw to hit.

5143
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:46,500
And especially from that range,

5144
02:24:46,501 --> 02:24:48,000
it didn't look like it
was going to happen,

5145
02:24:48,001 --> 02:24:52,240
but he does it to the guy who goes on
and become the world champion that way.

5146
02:24:52,241 --> 02:24:54,420
And then dominate other
guys at that weight class.

5147
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:55,261
Yeah.

5148
02:24:55,261 --> 02:24:56,610
Like that guy is special man.

5149
02:24:56,611 --> 02:24:57,241
I wanna see,

5150
02:24:57,241 --> 02:25:00,780
I wanna see him improve his standup
and get and get and just get better.

5151
02:25:00,781 --> 02:25:02,820
I want to see him do things like Dj is,

5152
02:25:02,821 --> 02:25:03,061
you know,

5153
02:25:03,061 --> 02:25:05,460
just working on his weaknesses and get,

5154
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:09,210
cause I mean that guy would never lose.

5155
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:14,390
Imagine if he had Djs,

5156
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:16,770
MMA Iq and skillset,

5157
02:25:17,150 --> 02:25:18,330
but his rest with,

5158
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:18,990
with his red,

5159
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:22,410
what is wrestling in ground is
now like who's beaten that guy?

5160
02:25:22,650 --> 02:25:24,490
I would send guy to fight wars for me.

5161
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:29,080
Yeah man,

5162
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:29,381
look,

5163
02:25:29,381 --> 02:25:32,440
he's he rag dolls dudes
in a very unusual way.

5164
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:33,130
And you,

5165
02:25:33,130 --> 02:25:35,770
every now and then a guy will come
up like that that can do that.

5166
02:25:35,950 --> 02:25:38,560
And he does it with
intensity and aggression.

5167
02:25:38,561 --> 02:25:40,240
Like Damien Maia,

5168
02:25:40,241 --> 02:25:40,871
rag dolls,

5169
02:25:40,871 --> 02:25:41,860
a lot of people too,

5170
02:25:42,010 --> 02:25:43,210
especially lately,

5171
02:25:43,690 --> 02:25:45,970
he gets a hold of guys
like I did with Rick story,

5172
02:25:45,971 --> 02:25:49,150
but he's doing it in like
this technical squeezy way.

5173
02:25:49,570 --> 02:25:52,190
You know when Norma girl
Madoff gets a hold of dudes,

5174
02:25:52,191 --> 02:25:53,560
it's a smash.

5175
02:25:53,561 --> 02:25:55,000
Everything is smash.

5176
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:56,950
He's driving you into the ground,

5177
02:25:56,951 --> 02:25:58,990
smashing you into the
ground that's smashing.

5178
02:25:58,991 --> 02:25:59,830
When you're on top of you.

5179
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:02,380
Damien Maia is just constricting.

5180
02:26:02,381 --> 02:26:06,770
He's like moving into position and he
slowly closing you off and he's gonna

5181
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:07,623
choke you.

5182
02:26:07,630 --> 02:26:09,790
It's a totally different
kind of domination.

5183
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:11,463
But then,

5184
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:14,110
I don't know if it's entirely
the fairest comparison,

5185
02:26:14,111 --> 02:26:15,920
cause Damien is obviously far,

5186
02:26:15,940 --> 02:26:19,410
much longer career and he fought
at one 85 and he fought again.

5187
02:26:19,450 --> 02:26:20,590
It's against Anderson.

5188
02:26:20,591 --> 02:26:21,730
He got knocked out by Nate.

5189
02:26:22,300 --> 02:26:24,730
He's had a lot of ups
and downs in the UFC.

5190
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:26,620
Jake shields beat him.

5191
02:26:26,621 --> 02:26:29,320
People forget that Jake Shields
essentially out grappled them,

5192
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:32,440
but number coming in off.

5193
02:26:32,470 --> 02:26:33,040
Good luck.

5194
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:33,671
Good luck out.

5195
02:26:33,671 --> 02:26:34,600
Grapple that dude.

5196
02:26:34,990 --> 02:26:35,823
Good luck.

5197
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:37,721
But what's his,

5198
02:26:37,721 --> 02:26:38,441
what does it take down?

5199
02:26:38,441 --> 02:26:39,430
Percentage like two,

5200
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:41,140
it's probably a million percent.

5201
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:42,881
I mean,

5202
02:26:42,881 --> 02:26:43,960
he takes down everybody.

5203
02:26:44,190 --> 02:26:46,630
But the other thing about
number go Madoff is um,

5204
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:47,201
uh,

5205
02:26:47,201 --> 02:26:50,680
that he gets injured a
lot and you got to wonder,

5206
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:55,180
is it because of that insane
fucking aggressive style of his,

5207
02:26:55,181 --> 02:26:55,830
it's so,

5208
02:26:55,830 --> 02:26:57,370
it makes it so fun to watch him.

5209
02:26:58,270 --> 02:27:01,060
Is that like you're kind of
red lining your body too much?

5210
02:27:03,910 --> 02:27:04,121
Yeah.

5211
02:27:04,121 --> 02:27:04,540
Right?

5212
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:05,373
Yeah.

5213
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:06,161
Yeah.

5214
02:27:06,161 --> 02:27:06,401
I mean,

5215
02:27:06,401 --> 02:27:07,150
you got arrest,

5216
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:07,570
right?

5217
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:08,500
You gotta heal up.

5218
02:27:08,501 --> 02:27:09,970
You can't always be on.

5219
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:10,991
Yeah.

5220
02:27:10,991 --> 02:27:11,890
But I mean,

5221
02:27:11,891 --> 02:27:15,850
can a guide like a Damien Maia
who trains very technically,

5222
02:27:16,390 --> 02:27:19,480
I mean obviously he wrestles and he
does like a lot of chaotic movements as

5223
02:27:19,481 --> 02:27:19,751
well,

5224
02:27:19,751 --> 02:27:24,370
but probably not nearly with the kind
of intensity the number men off does.

5225
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:25,960
You've got to wonder,

5226
02:27:25,961 --> 02:27:30,961
like that style is obviously super
effective and very fucking devastating and

5227
02:27:31,391 --> 02:27:32,224
fun to watch.

5228
02:27:32,530 --> 02:27:37,300
But I wonder if preparing for that style
and executing that style is almost like

5229
02:27:37,301 --> 02:27:39,220
ultimately too much on your joints,

5230
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:40,540
too much on your body.

5231
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:46,260
I guess the question would be then is
can he be no a Madoff without that style?

5232
02:27:49,650 --> 02:27:53,840
Like does he have the skill to
translate that to slowing it down and,

5233
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:54,540
and,

5234
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:55,840
and turning the volume down.

5235
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:59,020
It's not what you always wonder
about when a fighter gets injured,

5236
02:27:59,080 --> 02:28:01,030
when someone blows a knee
out or something like that.

5237
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:01,961
That and,

5238
02:28:01,961 --> 02:28:02,261
and,

5239
02:28:02,261 --> 02:28:03,850
and the situation they're training in.

5240
02:28:04,190 --> 02:28:05,023
I mean,

5241
02:28:05,050 --> 02:28:05,381
you know,

5242
02:28:05,381 --> 02:28:07,270
you go into a boxing gym to this day,

5243
02:28:07,271 --> 02:28:10,000
you go into a boxing gym
and it's sparring day.

5244
02:28:10,001 --> 02:28:12,910
You go up the wildcard exploring day
and there's only two guys in the ring.

5245
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:15,790
There's only the two guys that are
punching each other in the ring.

5246
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:20,170
You go to an MMA gym and on the
Mat there you and I work in.

5247
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:23,690
But then Joe and and and someone else or
working over here and that guy tries to

5248
02:28:23,691 --> 02:28:23,990
take,

5249
02:28:23,990 --> 02:28:26,140
take Joe down and he runs into my heel.

5250
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:26,661
Got It.

5251
02:28:26,661 --> 02:28:27,680
Does happen all the time.

5252
02:28:28,670 --> 02:28:30,050
I think that happened to Rashad Evans.

5253
02:28:30,051 --> 02:28:34,550
I think that's how he didn't fight
against Shogun for the title.

5254
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:38,300
Wasn't that what happened to Dominic?

5255
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:39,290
Did it happen to him as well?

5256
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:39,831
I wouldn't,

5257
02:28:39,831 --> 02:28:40,670
I wouldn't doubt it.

5258
02:28:40,940 --> 02:28:41,251
Got It.

5259
02:28:41,251 --> 02:28:42,084
So common,

5260
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:46,010
it's crazy because that would be way more
safe in boxing and they don't do it in

5261
02:28:46,011 --> 02:28:46,844
boxing.

5262
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:47,731
Like in boxing,

5263
02:28:47,731 --> 02:28:48,620
it'd be way more safe.

5264
02:28:48,621 --> 02:28:49,050
Right.

5265
02:28:49,050 --> 02:28:51,230
It'd be much less likely
that you're going to collide.

5266
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:52,423
Take downs.

5267
02:28:53,160 --> 02:28:56,360
The k the takedown was especially
cause you know like as well as I do.

5268
02:28:56,361 --> 02:28:57,360
If two guys are going at it,

5269
02:28:57,380 --> 02:28:58,211
one guy's defending in,

5270
02:28:58,211 --> 02:28:59,570
the other guys weren't really insistent.

5271
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:01,520
They could go all the way
across the fucking gym.

5272
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:02,030
Yup.

5273
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:03,080
Everybody's seen it and everyone's like,

5274
02:29:03,081 --> 02:29:03,280
Whoa,

5275
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:03,411
Whoa,

5276
02:29:03,411 --> 02:29:03,591
Whoa,

5277
02:29:03,591 --> 02:29:03,771
Whoa,

5278
02:29:03,771 --> 02:29:04,100
Whoa,

5279
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:04,521
Whoa,

5280
02:29:04,521 --> 02:29:05,480
whoa man.

5281
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,730
And now you have all of these takedown.

5282
02:29:07,731 --> 02:29:09,320
What marks all over the mat?

5283
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:10,610
You have just these puddles.

5284
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:11,473
Exactly.

5285
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:14,420
That fucks kickboxing up hardcore.

5286
02:29:15,370 --> 02:29:20,060
Those member when they used to have
fights where the Matt would have like some

5287
02:29:20,061 --> 02:29:23,570
sort of a us some logo on it and they,

5288
02:29:23,571 --> 02:29:25,430
before they figured out
how to do that right.

5289
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:27,050
Those things would be wet.

5290
02:29:27,051 --> 02:29:31,700
It's fucked from the sweat and they would
become like ice skating and you just

5291
02:29:31,910 --> 02:29:33,830
throw a kick and go
flying through the air.

5292
02:29:34,730 --> 02:29:36,230
I thought at that I'm king of the cage.

5293
02:29:36,231 --> 02:29:37,064
Wet and wild.

5294
02:29:37,430 --> 02:29:38,120
That's right.

5295
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:38,953
You did.

5296
02:29:39,330 --> 02:29:40,640
Holy Shit.

5297
02:29:40,970 --> 02:29:42,050
Tell people about that.

5298
02:29:42,051 --> 02:29:42,440
Cause that,

5299
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:47,360
that I think to this day is like one
of the all time legendary fight cards.

5300
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:48,920
Do you know about king in the cage?

5301
02:29:48,921 --> 02:29:49,754
Wet and wild.

5302
02:29:50,550 --> 02:29:52,040
Even school school.

5303
02:29:52,041 --> 02:29:54,340
Is She mad king in the
cage event and we're,

5304
02:29:54,341 --> 02:29:54,591
we're,

5305
02:29:54,591 --> 02:29:56,880
we're supposed to fight outside at um,

5306
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:57,931
Soboba is,

5307
02:29:57,931 --> 02:29:58,191
you know,

5308
02:29:58,191 --> 02:29:59,290
maybe as it's boob.

5309
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:00,220
Is that what came in the cage?

5310
02:30:00,430 --> 02:30:00,600
Well,

5311
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:01,161
I don't remember,

5312
02:30:01,161 --> 02:30:02,930
but it was a native American casino.

5313
02:30:02,931 --> 02:30:03,680
I remember that.

5314
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:05,870
And we were fighting outside king,

5315
02:30:05,900 --> 02:30:07,520
all the king of the cage
events where outside.

5316
02:30:07,521 --> 02:30:09,830
But it starts raining and everybody's,

5317
02:30:09,831 --> 02:30:11,600
everybody's ready to fight.

5318
02:30:11,930 --> 02:30:13,580
They still ready to put on the show.

5319
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:14,810
I'm king of the cage.

5320
02:30:14,811 --> 02:30:15,890
You could wear shoes in Kik.

5321
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:20,920
So basically we went out there and
fought in the rain on a vinyl mat.

5322
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:23,123
Ah,

5323
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:24,940
it was even was you,

5324
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:27,670
you fought the Jared,

5325
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:32,420
was that the same Jeremy Williams that
went on to fight Nate Diaz or Nick Diaz?

5326
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:33,480
Is that the same guy?

5327
02:30:33,480 --> 02:30:34,160
I think so.

5328
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:35,420
The guy was on the ultimate fighter.

5329
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:36,433
Is that the one I'm thinking of?

5330
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:38,450
I'm thinking of the wrong guy
and think of the wrong guy.

5331
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:41,450
The Jeremy Williams is the
guy that committed suicide.

5332
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:43,820
Oh Damn,

5333
02:30:43,821 --> 02:30:44,654
that's right.

5334
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:46,550
I knew that guy.

5335
02:30:47,030 --> 02:30:50,300
There's another Jeremy Williams
who was the light heavyweight guy,

5336
02:30:50,301 --> 02:30:50,570
right?

5337
02:30:50,570 --> 02:30:51,403
Yeah.

5338
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,730
Oh,

5339
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:53,361
that's right.

5340
02:30:53,361 --> 02:30:54,650
He was a good dude,

5341
02:30:54,651 --> 02:30:55,130
man.

5342
02:30:55,130 --> 02:30:57,590
That was a bummer for a lot
of people when that happened.

5343
02:30:58,130 --> 02:30:59,060
I didn't really know him.

5344
02:30:59,061 --> 02:30:59,181
We,

5345
02:30:59,181 --> 02:31:00,650
we kind of stayed in touch of course,

5346
02:31:00,651 --> 02:31:02,530
and you see each other at
other events and whatnot.

5347
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:02,930
And it was,

5348
02:31:02,930 --> 02:31:03,920
I had no beef with him,

5349
02:31:03,921 --> 02:31:05,330
so we would keep talking.

5350
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:06,523
Um,

5351
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:07,940
and he always seemed like a nice guy,

5352
02:31:07,970 --> 02:31:08,300
man.

5353
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:10,190
He was friends with Chris Brennan.

5354
02:31:10,250 --> 02:31:10,591
Yeah.

5355
02:31:10,591 --> 02:31:11,110
That's minimum.

5356
02:31:11,110 --> 02:31:11,801
Curtis Brennan.

5357
02:31:11,801 --> 02:31:12,460
Yeah.

5358
02:31:12,460 --> 02:31:13,161
And Chris Brennan,

5359
02:31:13,161 --> 02:31:15,170
who's always been a really good dude.

5360
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:15,560
Yeah.

5361
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:16,420
That was a,

5362
02:31:16,421 --> 02:31:17,270
a good friend of his,

5363
02:31:17,271 --> 02:31:18,104
and I remember that was a,

5364
02:31:18,290 --> 02:31:20,400
that was a big bummer when
that guy killed himself.

5365
02:31:22,650 --> 02:31:24,000
Fucking depression,

5366
02:31:24,001 --> 02:31:24,834
man.

5367
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:25,800
Oh,

5368
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:29,520
Duncan Trussell explained to price and
really good yesterday he was saying,

5369
02:31:29,521 --> 02:31:29,821
you know,

5370
02:31:29,821 --> 02:31:34,821
imagine what it's like if you like did
it just did a lot of ecstasy and you know

5371
02:31:34,831 --> 02:31:35,371
that feeling,

5372
02:31:35,371 --> 02:31:37,620
if you've ever done ecstasy the
next day where your head is like,

5373
02:31:37,650 --> 02:31:39,090
fuck this,

5374
02:31:39,091 --> 02:31:40,890
what did I do?

5375
02:31:40,891 --> 02:31:41,581
Oh my God,

5376
02:31:41,581 --> 02:31:43,440
my brain's drive feel like shit.

5377
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:45,780
But you can get through it because
you know it's not going to last.

5378
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:46,620
But he said like,

5379
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:48,960
imagine going through that for 10 years,

5380
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:50,730
you know,

5381
02:31:50,730 --> 02:31:54,840
imagine that feel and that's your
reality every day for 10 years.

5382
02:31:55,770 --> 02:31:56,730
It sounds miserable.

5383
02:31:56,731 --> 02:31:57,960
I don't know what x is like.

5384
02:31:58,830 --> 02:31:59,730
It's not good.

5385
02:31:59,850 --> 02:32:00,001
Well,

5386
02:32:00,001 --> 02:32:00,834
it's good when you're on,

5387
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:02,281
when you're off.

5388
02:32:02,281 --> 02:32:03,114
It's not good.

5389
02:32:03,390 --> 02:32:03,751
It's,

5390
02:32:03,751 --> 02:32:05,580
I only did it once and I loved it,

5391
02:32:06,090 --> 02:32:06,901
but I was like,

5392
02:32:06,901 --> 02:32:11,880
dad is not worth the juice is not
worth the squeeze to me at least.

5393
02:32:12,850 --> 02:32:13,680
So,

5394
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:16,230
but also I wasn't taking five HTP.

5395
02:32:16,231 --> 02:32:18,690
Apparently if you take
five HTP right afterwards,

5396
02:32:18,691 --> 02:32:21,420
it helps your brain a rebuild.

5397
02:32:21,870 --> 02:32:24,420
Do you take after you
wake up after you take it?

5398
02:32:24,421 --> 02:32:25,680
I think he's supposed to take it like,

5399
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,820
like in the middle of it so that
like when you come out of it,

5400
02:32:29,821 --> 02:32:30,170
you're,

5401
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:33,540
your body's already starting
to crank up its production.

5402
02:32:33,541 --> 02:32:36,120
If that might be completely
unscientific though.

5403
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:39,000
But I do know that the five
HTP is supposed to help you.

5404
02:32:39,090 --> 02:32:42,180
So you got get no sun x
and they get each team.

5405
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:44,041
I mean,

5406
02:32:44,041 --> 02:32:47,820
and that's obviously not the best
description of depression either.

5407
02:32:47,850 --> 02:32:48,880
Sometimes people,

5408
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:51,000
depression is social,

5409
02:32:51,001 --> 02:32:52,680
sometimes it's from,

5410
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:54,030
from life events.

5411
02:32:54,031 --> 02:32:54,450
You know,

5412
02:32:54,450 --> 02:32:55,020
who knows,

5413
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:57,780
who knows what's causing
someone to feel like shit.

5414
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:00,540
That guy was a good dude.

5415
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:02,760
He seemed like a nice guy.

5416
02:33:03,690 --> 02:33:05,040
I'm thinking of a different guy.

5417
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:08,760
I'm thinking of the guy
who fought Nick Diaz.

5418
02:33:08,761 --> 02:33:11,220
He was the first guy to stop
Nick Diaz and then he was on,

5419
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:13,800
his name was Jeremy,

5420
02:33:13,801 --> 02:33:14,820
but I don't think it was willy.

5421
02:33:14,830 --> 02:33:15,241
Can you,

5422
02:33:15,241 --> 02:33:15,660
uh,

5423
02:33:15,660 --> 02:33:16,870
think it was Jeremy Williams?

5424
02:33:17,180 --> 02:33:19,770
What I'm x talked about
him is inside his name.

5425
02:33:19,771 --> 02:33:20,130
I didn't,

5426
02:33:20,130 --> 02:33:21,030
I couldn't picture of

5427
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:24,000
the all season,

5428
02:33:24,001 --> 02:33:26,670
the ultimate fighter
that Nick Diaz was on.

5429
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:30,030
I think that Jeremy Jackson,

5430
02:33:30,031 --> 02:33:30,990
Jackson Sherman,

5431
02:33:30,991 --> 02:33:31,471
Jackson,

5432
02:33:31,471 --> 02:33:32,304
Jeremy Jackson,

5433
02:33:32,310 --> 02:33:32,760
Israel.

5434
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:33,181
It wasn't,

5435
02:33:33,181 --> 02:33:34,050
was it Nate Diaz?

5436
02:33:34,110 --> 02:33:35,070
Nate Diaz is here.

5437
02:33:35,190 --> 02:33:36,030
It wasn't nick.

5438
02:33:36,090 --> 02:33:36,271
No,

5439
02:33:36,271 --> 02:33:36,880
nick fought.

5440
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:39,090
It wasn't on the ultimate fighter.

5441
02:33:39,390 --> 02:33:40,620
Nate was on the ultimate fighter.

5442
02:33:40,860 --> 02:33:42,060
Goes on the ultimate fighter.

5443
02:33:42,390 --> 02:33:43,050
Yeah,

5444
02:33:43,050 --> 02:33:43,531
I think it was.

5445
02:33:43,531 --> 02:33:44,030
He on was,

5446
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:44,130
no,

5447
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:45,030
it was in the UFC.

5448
02:33:45,031 --> 02:33:46,170
It was just in the UFC.

5449
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:47,810
Jeremy was on the ultimate fighter.

5450
02:33:47,811 --> 02:33:48,350
Everybody got it.

5451
02:33:48,350 --> 02:33:49,560
Nick was him in the UFC,

5452
02:33:49,561 --> 02:33:50,910
but nick had fought him before.

5453
02:33:50,911 --> 02:33:51,480
Right.

5454
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:51,991
This is it.

5455
02:33:51,991 --> 02:33:52,824
This is the fight.

5456
02:33:53,250 --> 02:33:57,960
Nick Diaz vs Jeremy Jackson
at IFC warriors challenge 18.

5457
02:33:58,680 --> 02:33:59,041
Wow.

5458
02:33:59,041 --> 02:34:00,180
What year was that?

5459
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:02,281
Play?

5460
02:34:02,281 --> 02:34:03,114
That shit.

5461
02:34:03,150 --> 02:34:03,810
That was his,

5462
02:34:03,810 --> 02:34:08,640
that was his claim to claim to fame on
the show that him and Nick Diaz had that

5463
02:34:08,641 --> 02:34:09,474
right.

5464
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:10,650
Jeremy Jackson.

5465
02:34:11,130 --> 02:34:11,821
That's what it is.

5466
02:34:11,821 --> 02:34:13,560
Jeremy Jackson had nasty hands,

5467
02:34:13,561 --> 02:34:13,771
man.

5468
02:34:13,771 --> 02:34:15,150
He was a really good boxer.

5469
02:34:15,820 --> 02:34:16,360
Yes.

5470
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:16,651
Nick.

5471
02:34:16,651 --> 02:34:17,484
One time.

5472
02:34:17,710 --> 02:34:21,160
I asked Nick one time who is the
hardest silver hidden and uh,

5473
02:34:21,550 --> 02:34:23,890
he said he didn't say
who hit him the hardest.

5474
02:34:23,891 --> 02:34:26,240
He just said that Jeremy Jackson hit me.

5475
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:27,191
Hit hard as fuck.

5476
02:34:27,191 --> 02:34:28,470
See if you watch like his,

5477
02:34:28,510 --> 02:34:29,590
his striking here.

5478
02:34:29,591 --> 02:34:30,424
He was good.

5479
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:30,730
Yeah.

5480
02:34:30,730 --> 02:34:33,610
He was a good boxer and
they were both super young.

5481
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:35,200
I think nick was 18,

5482
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:38,830
if I remember right.

5483
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:39,551
It was,

5484
02:34:39,551 --> 02:34:41,110
it was close to it at least.

5485
02:34:42,130 --> 02:34:44,020
I think they were both
pretty young hair man.

5486
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:45,370
But uh,

5487
02:34:45,370 --> 02:34:46,540
and then nick went on to,

5488
02:34:46,541 --> 02:34:50,680
I think nick beat him by submission
and beat them by decision.

5489
02:34:50,681 --> 02:34:51,940
Did he find them three times?

5490
02:34:52,030 --> 02:34:53,380
I think they had a trilogy.

5491
02:34:53,800 --> 02:34:54,700
I think nick warm,

5492
02:34:54,701 --> 02:34:55,534
although,

5493
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:55,991
no,

5494
02:34:55,991 --> 02:34:56,320
I don't think,

5495
02:34:56,320 --> 02:34:57,550
I think Jeremy stopped him.

5496
02:34:57,870 --> 02:34:58,390
Huh?

5497
02:34:58,390 --> 02:35:00,190
I think he stopped him in this fight.

5498
02:35:00,220 --> 02:35:02,860
I think this was the first
fight that nick ever lost.

5499
02:35:04,300 --> 02:35:04,841
I think this is the,

5500
02:35:04,841 --> 02:35:07,000
actually the only time the
naked ever been stopped.

5501
02:35:08,690 --> 02:35:09,520
Yeah,

5502
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:09,851
man,

5503
02:35:09,851 --> 02:35:10,031
I,

5504
02:35:10,031 --> 02:35:13,750
I had heard some crazy rumor that I'd
hoped was true that they were going to try

5505
02:35:13,751 --> 02:35:15,400
to set up nick versus Connor.

5506
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:17,921
I'm like,

5507
02:35:17,921 --> 02:35:18,581
my God,

5508
02:35:18,581 --> 02:35:20,530
that would break the world.

5509
02:35:20,890 --> 02:35:25,890
Do you know how like insane the hype
would be for a Nick Diaz versus Conor

5510
02:35:26,170 --> 02:35:26,860
Mcgregor fight?

5511
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:27,011
I mean,

5512
02:35:27,011 --> 02:35:27,844
could we even,

5513
02:35:28,180 --> 02:35:30,700
can you even imagine
how crazy that would be?

5514
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:32,141
So good that,

5515
02:35:32,141 --> 02:35:34,630
that that would be like the sequel to,

5516
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:35,600
Oh my God.

5517
02:35:35,710 --> 02:35:36,051
Yeah,

5518
02:35:36,051 --> 02:35:38,680
a much better bigger
my God Avengers movie.

5519
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:40,240
Could you imagine if they do that?

5520
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:41,561
I mean,

5521
02:35:41,561 --> 02:35:41,860
look,

5522
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:44,710
the thing is a nick has
never making one 55 again.

5523
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:45,460
He's just not,

5524
02:35:45,460 --> 02:35:46,360
he's way too big.

5525
02:35:46,540 --> 02:35:47,200
It,

5526
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:48,190
he didn't think he could do it.

5527
02:35:48,191 --> 02:35:49,120
He could absolutely do it.

5528
02:35:49,410 --> 02:35:50,243
He's not that big.

5529
02:35:50,980 --> 02:35:51,581
Oh Man.

5530
02:35:51,581 --> 02:35:52,180
He looks,

5531
02:35:52,180 --> 02:35:52,550
I mean,

5532
02:35:52,550 --> 02:35:53,920
it doesn't look small.

5533
02:35:54,940 --> 02:35:55,330
I mean,

5534
02:35:55,330 --> 02:35:57,400
he's going to have to lose
[inaudible] amount of bonds.

5535
02:35:57,430 --> 02:35:59,320
60 I don't think he's ever at eight 55.

5536
02:35:59,350 --> 02:35:59,800
That's one.

5537
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:01,990
1655 of the UFC.

5538
02:36:02,170 --> 02:36:05,070
I think he fought 55
against Diego Sanchez.

5539
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:06,233
Um,

5540
02:36:06,530 --> 02:36:08,320
I think they could say,

5541
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:11,070
could leave one thing niggas ever funded.

5542
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:12,210
55 yes.

5543
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:12,461
Yeah.

5544
02:36:12,461 --> 02:36:13,600
Nick fought at 55.

5545
02:36:14,020 --> 02:36:14,590
Yeah.

5546
02:36:14,590 --> 02:36:15,160
Yeah.

5547
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:16,570
Make Fun of 55 I believe you.

5548
02:36:16,571 --> 02:36:16,791
Fuck.

5549
02:36:16,791 --> 02:36:19,060
Go me if 55 or do you fight him at 60?

5550
02:36:19,210 --> 02:36:20,320
He fought Gomi at 60.

5551
02:36:20,360 --> 02:36:20,800
60.

5552
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:21,580
That was pride.

5553
02:36:21,580 --> 02:36:22,840
What a fight that was.

5554
02:36:23,050 --> 02:36:24,190
Oh my goodness.

5555
02:36:24,580 --> 02:36:26,110
That was crazy.

5556
02:36:26,111 --> 02:36:26,780
That was when gum,

5557
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:28,390
he was going to go me,

5558
02:36:28,391 --> 02:36:29,980
it was just knocking dude's dead.

5559
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:32,050
And Nick took some bombs.

5560
02:36:32,051 --> 02:36:35,260
He had that big ass cut on his cheek
and he locked up that Gogal Plata.

5561
02:36:35,650 --> 02:36:36,790
He fought a lot of,

5562
02:36:36,990 --> 02:36:38,950
when we were training for the Anderson,

5563
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:39,971
I was looking over his,

5564
02:36:39,971 --> 02:36:42,060
figured he's fought a lot
of hitters like in there,

5565
02:36:42,070 --> 02:36:45,400
like fucking probably knock
him the fuck out of people.

5566
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:45,670
They were like,

5567
02:36:45,670 --> 02:36:45,881
okay,

5568
02:36:45,881 --> 02:36:46,720
let's match him up.

5569
02:36:47,190 --> 02:36:48,340
That was Nick's opponent.

5570
02:36:48,610 --> 02:36:50,500
Do you remember when nick
knocked out Robbie Lawler?

5571
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:54,040
So we were in the same
locker room that night.

5572
02:36:54,430 --> 02:36:55,263
Nick and I,

5573
02:36:55,510 --> 02:36:56,343
and um,

5574
02:36:56,770 --> 02:37:01,770
he was hitting pads with my
co with his coach and he was,

5575
02:37:02,710 --> 02:37:03,790
he was being nick.

5576
02:37:03,820 --> 02:37:06,790
He's back to hitting pads is
early in when he was boxing.

5577
02:37:06,791 --> 02:37:09,520
So his boxing has gotten
much better over time,

5578
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:10,630
but he was hitting pads.

5579
02:37:10,631 --> 02:37:11,710
It didn't look awesome.

5580
02:37:11,950 --> 02:37:12,783
And he was just,

5581
02:37:12,930 --> 02:37:14,410
I'm a knock this mother fucking out.

5582
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:15,260
Yeah,

5583
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:16,093
it's right.

5584
02:37:16,500 --> 02:37:19,340
Just get just pumping himself up in the
back talking about how he's going to

5585
02:37:19,341 --> 02:37:20,900
knock or I'll be out and do all this shit.

5586
02:37:20,901 --> 02:37:21,591
And I was just like,

5587
02:37:21,591 --> 02:37:22,710
he ain't knocking out nothing.

5588
02:37:22,730 --> 02:37:23,720
All those bunches.

5589
02:37:24,350 --> 02:37:26,630
And then he went out there and
knocked him out with a jab.

5590
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:29,420
What was kind of like
a little like a hook.

5591
02:37:30,150 --> 02:37:31,820
A short long hook.

5592
02:37:31,850 --> 02:37:32,510
Yeah.

5593
02:37:32,510 --> 02:37:33,690
With the lead AOL.

5594
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:34,491
So yeah,

5595
02:37:34,491 --> 02:37:34,851
Short,

5596
02:37:34,851 --> 02:37:35,611
Long Hook with the little,

5597
02:37:35,611 --> 02:37:35,841
yeah,

5598
02:37:35,841 --> 02:37:37,130
it was like a straight arm,

5599
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:39,020
but it was like a little pop to it.

5600
02:37:39,820 --> 02:37:40,653
I was,

5601
02:37:40,700 --> 02:37:41,533
I was,

5602
02:37:41,810 --> 02:37:43,400
I was taken aback dude.

5603
02:37:43,401 --> 02:37:46,250
He was talking so much shit before that
fight to this day I've said that that

5604
02:37:46,251 --> 02:37:51,170
was one of the most interesting things
that I've seen as a commentator is like

5605
02:37:51,171 --> 02:37:54,830
there's reactions that people have
to certain things and sometimes it's

5606
02:37:54,831 --> 02:37:55,880
psychological shit.

5607
02:37:55,930 --> 02:37:56,210
Yeah.

5608
02:37:56,210 --> 02:37:59,960
Like sometimes there's these crazy
moments where people like Rhonda Rousey

5609
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:01,280
Gotten Holly Holmes face and it was like,

5610
02:38:01,281 --> 02:38:01,721
Whoa,

5611
02:38:01,721 --> 02:38:02,061
Whoa,

5612
02:38:02,061 --> 02:38:03,110
what the fuck is going on?

5613
02:38:03,410 --> 02:38:07,470
Like there's moments where you
see in fights where you can do,

5614
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:09,170
I mean don't you feel like that there's,

5615
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:10,130
yeah,

5616
02:38:10,130 --> 02:38:14,210
there are times when shit like that
happens where you just see that someone,

5617
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:14,451
you,

5618
02:38:14,451 --> 02:38:15,260
you see it,

5619
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:17,300
you see who they really
are for a split second.

5620
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:18,260
What you see these,

5621
02:38:18,261 --> 02:38:18,860
see these,

5622
02:38:18,860 --> 02:38:22,730
there's this weird moments when you
see someone affected by shit talking.

5623
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:27,440
And Nick got into the cage with Robbie
Lawler and you start to go on Stockton

5624
02:38:27,441 --> 02:38:31,520
mother fucker stocked and mother
fucker and Robbie Lara's like,

5625
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:33,380
what is going on here?

5626
02:38:33,560 --> 02:38:35,780
Because Robbie's like
a pretty mellow dude,

5627
02:38:35,900 --> 02:38:36,421
like Robbie,

5628
02:38:36,421 --> 02:38:37,280
super violent.

5629
02:38:37,281 --> 02:38:38,900
And a lot of people think
he's the Boogie man.

5630
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:41,540
Like people are scared of
Robbie cause he's so violent.

5631
02:38:41,541 --> 02:38:44,480
I mean he's a incredibly
aggressive fighter.

5632
02:38:44,810 --> 02:38:45,621
Bad mother fucker.

5633
02:38:45,621 --> 02:38:46,190
Right?

5634
02:38:46,190 --> 02:38:47,450
But you could see Robbie was like,

5635
02:38:47,451 --> 02:38:49,100
what is going on here?

5636
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:49,441
I,

5637
02:38:49,441 --> 02:38:53,120
this dude is yelling Stockton
motherfucker and two oh nine bitch,

5638
02:38:53,150 --> 02:38:54,170
I never knew that.

5639
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:55,490
And then he's standing in and he's going,

5640
02:38:55,491 --> 02:38:55,990
what bitch?

5641
02:38:55,990 --> 02:38:56,630
What bitch?

5642
02:38:56,630 --> 02:38:57,411
What are you gonna do Bitch?

5643
02:38:57,411 --> 02:38:58,244
What you gonna do Bitch?

5644
02:38:58,310 --> 02:39:00,770
And he's like talking all this crazy
shit to him while he's hitting him.

5645
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:01,731
And you could see,

5646
02:39:01,731 --> 02:39:04,400
you could see like the
effect it was happening.

5647
02:39:04,610 --> 02:39:05,750
Like you could see nick,

5648
02:39:05,780 --> 02:39:06,320
they were both,

5649
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:06,501
okay,

5650
02:39:06,501 --> 02:39:07,490
look at the age there.

5651
02:39:07,580 --> 02:39:08,660
Nick was only 20

5652
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:10,670
man.

5653
02:39:10,670 --> 02:39:14,960
People forget how fucking young he was
when he was fighting at a really high

5654
02:39:14,961 --> 02:39:15,380
lookout.

5655
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:15,831
Beautiful.

5656
02:39:15,831 --> 02:39:18,980
Bruce buffer is like you
went into a time machine

5657
02:39:20,840 --> 02:39:21,650
and um,

5658
02:39:21,650 --> 02:39:24,980
nick came out and from the
moment the fight started,

5659
02:39:24,981 --> 02:39:27,140
he's just talking mad shit.

5660
02:39:29,180 --> 02:39:29,751
He's pretty yoke.

5661
02:39:29,751 --> 02:39:34,340
Then he had that one giant advantage.

5662
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:37,310
Not just like being tough
and being crazy like those,

5663
02:39:37,311 --> 02:39:38,000
those were good.

5664
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,400
He had a real good ground game
that people would sleep on.

5665
02:39:40,670 --> 02:39:41,660
That was big too.

5666
02:39:42,350 --> 02:39:44,420
But it's fucking pace man.

5667
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:45,950
His endurance,

5668
02:39:46,820 --> 02:39:49,790
his endurance is insane
and his pace is constant.

5669
02:39:49,970 --> 02:39:51,260
He's never breaks.

5670
02:39:51,710 --> 02:39:52,160
There's no,

5671
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:52,993
no rest.

5672
02:39:53,210 --> 02:39:54,260
And it's incredible.

5673
02:39:54,410 --> 02:39:56,300
How quickly with SAP guys,

5674
02:39:56,690 --> 02:39:58,490
well you could see it just drain them.

5675
02:39:58,840 --> 02:39:59,450
What's like,

5676
02:39:59,450 --> 02:40:01,430
I think like where I was at 20,

5677
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:04,220
like what I was into at 20 a 20.

5678
02:40:04,221 --> 02:40:04,971
He's like that.

5679
02:40:04,971 --> 02:40:09,140
He's the kid that was on like the cross
country team fucking swim team on the

5680
02:40:09,170 --> 02:40:14,170
summertime and you haven't his brother
go mountain bike and all day long

5681
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:14,851
as kids,

5682
02:40:14,851 --> 02:40:15,684
you know,

5683
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:17,180
and he's funny and cute.

5684
02:40:17,230 --> 02:40:18,930
That high level precedent.

5685
02:40:19,500 --> 02:40:20,333
Yeah.

5686
02:40:21,060 --> 02:40:21,990
Yeah man.

5687
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:22,860
His uh,

5688
02:40:23,190 --> 02:40:28,190
his extreme endurance and
it's participation and
triathlete events and you know,

5689
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:30,720
he's done iron mans I think.

5690
02:40:30,721 --> 02:40:31,380
And I know he's,

5691
02:40:31,380 --> 02:40:32,580
I think he corrected me.

5692
02:40:32,581 --> 02:40:37,581
I said on a podcast once that he had
swam back and forth from a Alcatraz

5693
02:40:37,741 --> 02:40:38,910
Alcatraz twice.

5694
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:40,410
He said five times.

5695
02:40:40,770 --> 02:40:42,180
He's done it five times.

5696
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:45,060
Dude,

5697
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:46,600
I swear he was making fun of them.

5698
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:48,750
I swear to God is big a foot a day.

5699
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:52,560
Like a week ago or two weeks ago we
were talking about this and he's like,

5700
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:54,070
they just never done the triathlon.

5701
02:40:54,130 --> 02:40:55,380
Never done Alcatraz.

5702
02:40:55,381 --> 02:40:56,400
I've done it like four times.

5703
02:40:56,401 --> 02:40:56,850
Probably thought,

5704
02:40:56,850 --> 02:40:56,991
look,

5705
02:40:56,991 --> 02:40:57,781
he's talking to him.

5706
02:40:57,781 --> 02:40:58,051
He was like,

5707
02:40:58,051 --> 02:40:58,950
what bitch webpage?

5708
02:40:59,130 --> 02:40:59,401
He's like,

5709
02:40:59,401 --> 02:41:00,300
Nate's never done it.

5710
02:41:00,301 --> 02:41:02,670
So he was a pussy because
he knows swam from Alcatraz.

5711
02:41:02,860 --> 02:41:04,020
Just dude,

5712
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:09,230
that is shark infested water that is
legitimately 100% shark infested water.

5713
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:12,030
You're not just swimming,

5714
02:41:12,031 --> 02:41:16,740
you're swimming through the habitat of
one of the great monsters of earth who he

5715
02:41:16,741 --> 02:41:17,930
just clipped him with a right hand there.

5716
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:26,880
This was such an interesting fight,

5717
02:41:26,881 --> 02:41:27,420
man,

5718
02:41:27,420 --> 02:41:31,890
who was such an interesting fight because
I thought of nick before this fight as

5719
02:41:31,891 --> 02:41:33,910
really a Jujitsu guy.

5720
02:41:33,930 --> 02:41:35,490
I didn't think of him as a striker.

5721
02:41:35,930 --> 02:41:36,691
That same here.

5722
02:41:36,691 --> 02:41:39,240
That's why I was thinking when he
said he was gonna knock this move.

5723
02:41:39,241 --> 02:41:40,074
Who the hell?

5724
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:41,190
I was like,

5725
02:41:41,610 --> 02:41:44,710
we started getting really good at boxing
when he went over to strike for us.

5726
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:45,740
The strike force,

5727
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:45,990
uh,

5728
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:47,430
Virgin Have Nick Diaz who's like,

5729
02:41:47,440 --> 02:41:48,350
it's all dailies.

5730
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:49,313
Oh yeah.

5731
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:50,190
Oh yeah,

5732
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:51,023
yeah,

5733
02:41:51,480 --> 02:41:52,313
yeah.

5734
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,240
What's an [inaudible]?

5735
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:55,120
Yup.

5736
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:55,953
Yup.

5737
02:41:56,410 --> 02:41:57,310
Got Damn.

5738
02:41:58,440 --> 02:42:00,210
See that's the fight.

5739
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:01,830
If I was the guy with the cash,

5740
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:04,890
listen guys,

5741
02:42:05,450 --> 02:42:06,660
just do this.

5742
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:08,750
Connor likes fight at one 70.

5743
02:42:08,790 --> 02:42:09,870
Guess who else likes fight?

5744
02:42:09,871 --> 02:42:12,030
They won 70 nick fucking Diaz.

5745
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:13,013
Come on.

5746
02:42:13,940 --> 02:42:16,090
But I mean maybe Nate would get pissed it,

5747
02:42:16,170 --> 02:42:18,790
his brothers stepping in
and fighting him and Nah,

5748
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:20,220
meaning they seem,

5749
02:42:20,221 --> 02:42:21,760
they seem like they're,

5750
02:42:21,880 --> 02:42:22,131
they're,

5751
02:42:22,131 --> 02:42:22,650
they're,

5752
02:42:22,650 --> 02:42:23,550
they're one and the same.

5753
02:42:23,551 --> 02:42:24,780
This symbiotic man.

5754
02:42:25,170 --> 02:42:26,150
But do you think like here,

5755
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:27,490
like this is like 12 years.

5756
02:42:27,530 --> 02:42:27,770
The,

5757
02:42:27,770 --> 02:42:28,510
there's a shot.

5758
02:42:28,510 --> 02:42:29,343
Yup.

5759
02:42:29,970 --> 02:42:30,690
Wow,

5760
02:42:30,690 --> 02:42:31,381
that's crazy.

5761
02:42:31,381 --> 02:42:32,214
Show that again.

5762
02:42:34,960 --> 02:42:36,640
There's a short right hook
there that's done them.

5763
02:42:39,930 --> 02:42:42,750
This is a fun time capsule,

5764
02:42:42,751 --> 02:42:43,510
right.

5765
02:42:43,510 --> 02:42:46,380
To go back and watch
fights from that long ago.

5766
02:42:46,440 --> 02:42:47,273
Yeah.

5767
02:42:49,050 --> 02:42:49,810
It's funny cause I,

5768
02:42:49,810 --> 02:42:50,221
I'm,

5769
02:42:50,221 --> 02:42:51,780
I'm working here it comes.

5770
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:52,980
Yeah.

5771
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:56,340
See he had stung them
with a punch before that,

5772
02:42:57,210 --> 02:42:59,230
before he circled in that dude.

5773
02:42:59,910 --> 02:43:00,743
Yeah.

5774
02:43:03,070 --> 02:43:03,903
Wow.

5775
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:07,480
That was the birth of
Nick Diaz and the UFC.

5776
02:43:07,481 --> 02:43:08,030
Really?

5777
02:43:08,030 --> 02:43:10,330
That was where people
got excited about them.

5778
02:43:11,230 --> 02:43:11,730
I roll,

5779
02:43:11,730 --> 02:43:12,270
I

5780
02:43:12,270 --> 02:43:15,310
rolled with Nate for the
first time during that,

5781
02:43:15,330 --> 02:43:15,700
um,

5782
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:17,830
that fight week was there with nick.

5783
02:43:17,831 --> 02:43:18,880
I just remember it now.

5784
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:19,900
Nate was there with nick.

5785
02:43:19,901 --> 02:43:20,471
I went down,

5786
02:43:20,471 --> 02:43:20,801
I didn't,

5787
02:43:20,801 --> 02:43:24,310
my team wasn't there for awhile and
I went down to the workout room.

5788
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:26,620
I was just jumping rope and nick was like,

5789
02:43:27,580 --> 02:43:28,413
hey man,

5790
02:43:28,450 --> 02:43:29,470
that's all you're going to do.

5791
02:43:29,650 --> 02:43:30,101
I was like,

5792
02:43:30,101 --> 02:43:30,251
yeah,

5793
02:43:30,251 --> 02:43:31,240
my team's not here yet.

5794
02:43:31,241 --> 02:43:31,571
He's like,

5795
02:43:31,571 --> 02:43:34,330
you want someone to rule
with is my brother's here.

5796
02:43:34,390 --> 02:43:37,780
So I wrote with Nick and Nate and um,

5797
02:43:37,990 --> 02:43:38,711
he's really good.

5798
02:43:38,711 --> 02:43:42,310
Then he was like 17
he's really good though.

5799
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:43,800
Yeah.

5800
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:47,410
Do you don't see their ground
game dot often cause they're,

5801
02:43:47,440 --> 02:43:52,440
they like to strike like the entire last
fight with Conor was an almost entirely

5802
02:43:53,050 --> 02:43:53,980
stand up fight.

5803
02:43:54,490 --> 02:43:55,211
But when you see him,

5804
02:43:55,211 --> 02:43:56,410
when he gets guys to the ground,

5805
02:43:56,560 --> 02:43:58,020
like the way you went through Connor,

5806
02:43:58,021 --> 02:44:00,400
that that whole sequence
of beating them up,

5807
02:44:00,401 --> 02:44:03,940
taking his back and choking
him does very sharp.

5808
02:44:04,070 --> 02:44:04,690
It's not,

5809
02:44:04,690 --> 02:44:05,380
there's no room,

5810
02:44:05,380 --> 02:44:06,340
there's no fat in there.

5811
02:44:06,370 --> 02:44:07,203
It's no room in there.

5812
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:09,130
And you can see it.

5813
02:44:09,131 --> 02:44:09,761
It was for him,

5814
02:44:09,761 --> 02:44:10,451
it was flawless.

5815
02:44:10,451 --> 02:44:10,861
It was just,

5816
02:44:10,861 --> 02:44:11,210
it was,

5817
02:44:11,210 --> 02:44:12,850
he'd done that a million times before.

5818
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:15,610
He has ten thousand ten
thousand hours of that.

5819
02:44:16,170 --> 02:44:16,300
Oh,

5820
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:17,260
a hundred percent yeah.

5821
02:44:17,950 --> 02:44:18,161
Yeah.

5822
02:44:18,161 --> 02:44:18,530
And then,

5823
02:44:18,530 --> 02:44:20,620
and there's really almost
no substitute for that,

5824
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:22,353
but

5825
02:44:24,230 --> 02:44:27,040
there's so many fucking
good fights to be made now.

5826
02:44:27,310 --> 02:44:27,581
I mean,

5827
02:44:27,581 --> 02:44:32,280
nobody's even talking about Michael
Johnson is going to fight men off Michael

5828
02:44:32,280 --> 02:44:32,290
Johnson's.

5829
02:44:32,290 --> 02:44:33,123
Right.

5830
02:44:34,180 --> 02:44:35,050
That's exciting.

5831
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:37,360
So that's exciting.

5832
02:44:37,990 --> 02:44:42,310
This is the first time when the UFC as
has put together a card to the two oh

5833
02:44:42,311 --> 02:44:44,290
five card for me.

5834
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:47,830
Like in my personal opinion
that when they hit pipe,

5835
02:44:47,831 --> 02:44:49,090
it is the biggest card ever.

5836
02:44:49,420 --> 02:44:49,780
I'm like,

5837
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:50,350
yeah,

5838
02:44:50,350 --> 02:44:50,681
I mean,

5839
02:44:50,681 --> 02:44:50,951
yeah,

5840
02:44:50,951 --> 02:44:51,490
this is,

5841
02:44:51,490 --> 02:44:52,720
this is the biggest card ever,

5842
02:44:52,721 --> 02:44:55,690
but there's like four or two
or three good fights on it.

5843
02:44:55,810 --> 02:44:57,100
Like to be big fights.

5844
02:44:57,101 --> 02:44:57,701
This card,

5845
02:44:57,701 --> 02:45:01,240
every single fight on this card
could main event and a shill.

5846
02:45:01,270 --> 02:45:01,900
Yeah.

5847
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:04,510
Like whether it be a
fight night or whatever,

5848
02:45:04,570 --> 02:45:06,880
every fight on this card
can mean of any show.

5849
02:45:06,940 --> 02:45:07,773
It really could.

5850
02:45:07,900 --> 02:45:08,740
It's crazy.

5851
02:45:08,830 --> 02:45:09,160
Yeah.

5852
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:09,730
It's an,

5853
02:45:09,730 --> 02:45:10,720
it's a nutty card.

5854
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:14,260
There's three world title fights
and there's so many great fights.

5855
02:45:14,261 --> 02:45:15,970
Like the number of
growing off Johnson fight.

5856
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:17,650
Rashad is fine.

5857
02:45:17,651 --> 02:45:18,600
10 Kennedy,

5858
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:21,850
there's a lot of good fights on that card.

5859
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:23,140
Tiago Alvarez.

5860
02:45:23,170 --> 02:45:23,890
Yeah.

5861
02:45:23,890 --> 02:45:24,401
Whose Shadow?

5862
02:45:24,401 --> 02:45:25,234
Fighting again?

5863
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:26,860
He was supposed to fight I Quinta.

5864
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:27,641
They changed it.

5865
02:45:27,641 --> 02:45:28,474
That's right.

5866
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:28,931
But who,

5867
02:45:28,931 --> 02:45:29,081
uh,

5868
02:45:29,081 --> 02:45:30,510
who replaced yet?

5869
02:45:31,150 --> 02:45:31,983
Here it is.

5870
02:45:32,480 --> 02:45:33,313
Where is it?

5871
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:34,560
Where's Tiago office?

5872
02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:35,423
Oh,

5873
02:45:36,490 --> 02:45:36,941
that's good.

5874
02:45:36,941 --> 02:45:37,760
To Hell.

5875
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:40,000
That might be just as good that,

5876
02:45:40,001 --> 02:45:40,834
um,

5877
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:42,430
I hated hearing that though.

5878
02:45:42,460 --> 02:45:43,780
That ally acquainted thing.

5879
02:45:45,490 --> 02:45:45,860
Yeah.

5880
02:45:45,860 --> 02:45:46,693
That was a bummer.

5881
02:45:46,990 --> 02:45:47,690
You know,

5882
02:45:47,690 --> 02:45:49,180
I don't know what the full story is.

5883
02:45:49,510 --> 02:45:50,343
I don't know either,

5884
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:55,060
but I'm a fan of I aquanto
he's a fun dude to watch.

5885
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:57,520
There's a lot of guys out there.

5886
02:45:57,550 --> 02:45:58,383
I mean

5887
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:00,730
it's crazy because this,

5888
02:46:00,731 --> 02:46:01,211
this is,

5889
02:46:01,211 --> 02:46:03,480
I feel this is the first generation of,

5890
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:06,640
of guys that have come up as
MMA fighters the whole time,

5891
02:46:06,980 --> 02:46:07,813
the whole way through.

5892
02:46:08,670 --> 02:46:11,270
Even even Nate being as young as he is,

5893
02:46:11,271 --> 02:46:11,960
he still,

5894
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:14,600
he was still a Jujitsu
guy coming into this,

5895
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:18,890
but there are these kids now that
a fight like Mossad backtick.

5896
02:46:18,891 --> 02:46:22,370
I feel like Massaad is one of those
guys that he started training MMA.

5897
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:24,433
Yeah.

5898
02:46:25,730 --> 02:46:27,080
And when you're doing that,

5899
02:46:27,110 --> 02:46:29,810
how important is it to
find the right coach?

5900
02:46:29,811 --> 02:46:32,210
The right coach is so valuable.

5901
02:46:32,290 --> 02:46:33,020
Yeah.

5902
02:46:33,020 --> 02:46:37,490
Because how many guys can give you
that full sort of for Rasa Hobby,

5903
02:46:37,640 --> 02:46:42,230
Matt Hume sort of experience or they've
got black belt level or Jujitsu,

5904
02:46:42,350 --> 02:46:43,940
like real worldclass striking.

5905
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:47,870
They really know what the fuck they're
doing and they understand the game deep,

5906
02:46:47,930 --> 02:46:48,763
deep in and out.

5907
02:46:48,950 --> 02:46:49,370
Yeah.

5908
02:46:49,370 --> 02:46:54,170
There's only a small amount of those
guys and it's not a coincidence that like

5909
02:46:54,190 --> 02:46:54,390
the,

5910
02:46:54,390 --> 02:46:59,390
the great ones like Demetrius Demean
Demetrius gives up all of his credit to

5911
02:46:59,631 --> 02:47:00,410
Matt Hume.

5912
02:47:00,410 --> 02:47:00,771
You know,

5913
02:47:00,771 --> 02:47:05,771
I mean it's like he found a guy who was
a pioneer of the sport who was a real

5914
02:47:06,861 --> 02:47:08,210
high level Moy Thai guy,

5915
02:47:08,420 --> 02:47:09,470
real high level,

5916
02:47:09,471 --> 02:47:14,471
a a black male in Jujitsu and competed
at a real high level in Japan.

5917
02:47:14,661 --> 02:47:15,110
He,

5918
02:47:15,110 --> 02:47:16,780
nobody fought well the fans.

5919
02:47:18,070 --> 02:47:18,320
Yeah,

5920
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:19,540
but he um,

5921
02:47:19,910 --> 02:47:23,960
he fought pat Miletich remember that he
stopped pat military in an MMA fight.

5922
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:27,020
Like mad Hume in his day
was a bad motherfucker.

5923
02:47:27,350 --> 02:47:30,860
So it only made sense that he
would also become a great coach.

5924
02:47:31,610 --> 02:47:34,010
But how many of those
guys are there like that?

5925
02:47:34,040 --> 02:47:37,220
Like that's got that kind of Matt Hume
type experience and understanding of the

5926
02:47:37,221 --> 02:47:37,670
sport.

5927
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:39,230
It's coming now now,

5928
02:47:39,231 --> 02:47:39,620
right?

5929
02:47:39,620 --> 02:47:44,390
Because of of guys from my generation
like Dean Thomas and Mike Brown.

5930
02:47:44,600 --> 02:47:45,111
Right,

5931
02:47:45,111 --> 02:47:45,261
right,

5932
02:47:45,261 --> 02:47:45,441
right,

5933
02:47:45,441 --> 02:47:46,010
right.

5934
02:47:46,010 --> 02:47:46,580
Yeah.

5935
02:47:46,580 --> 02:47:47,300
Josh.

5936
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:49,280
Josh Thompson is about to be retired.

5937
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:51,560
He or he's closer to retirement.

5938
02:47:51,561 --> 02:47:53,600
Then some of these younger guys,

5939
02:47:53,601 --> 02:47:54,434
these guys are,

5940
02:47:57,790 --> 02:47:58,160
shoot,

5941
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:02,700
there's so many guys now that at that
point and this next generation of guys are

5942
02:48:02,720 --> 02:48:07,420
going to know they're not going to have
to go to a Jujitsu gym and then to a

5943
02:48:07,430 --> 02:48:08,600
kickboxing place.

5944
02:48:09,210 --> 02:48:12,830
You know they're going to have these
coaches that know the game that they are

5945
02:48:12,831 --> 02:48:16,190
teaching them mixed martial arts and not
teaching them individual parts of it.

5946
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:19,010
Don't you think there's still going to
be specialized coaches though for each

5947
02:48:19,011 --> 02:48:19,910
individual thing?

5948
02:48:19,940 --> 02:48:20,181
Yeah,

5949
02:48:20,181 --> 02:48:20,640
for sure.

5950
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:25,640
Because because those guys from
that generation know that hey they,

5951
02:48:25,970 --> 02:48:29,990
they're good at it altogether but there
are still parts of it that they are not,

5952
02:48:30,160 --> 02:48:31,940
their rating is not going to be a hundred.

5953
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:32,863
Right.

5954
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:36,140
Well like Duane Ludwig is probably a real
good example of that because obviously

5955
02:48:36,200 --> 02:48:36,590
Dwayne,

5956
02:48:36,590 --> 02:48:39,530
Dwayne kickbox had a real high level.

5957
02:48:39,531 --> 02:48:39,820
He,

5958
02:48:39,820 --> 02:48:44,750
he's excellent MMA fighter and when
you watch like what he's coaching,

5959
02:48:44,751 --> 02:48:45,890
he's primarily coaching,

5960
02:48:45,891 --> 02:48:46,660
striking,

5961
02:48:46,660 --> 02:48:46,880
you know,

5962
02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:48,740
he understands ground game very well.

5963
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:50,000
I mean he did submit people,

5964
02:48:50,001 --> 02:48:52,250
I don't know what is
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu belt is,

5965
02:48:52,251 --> 02:48:54,190
but I'm sure he's very
competent on the ground.

5966
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:58,820
But Dwayne is more of a specialist in
the striking than anything else that he

5967
02:48:58,821 --> 02:48:59,600
does.

5968
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:03,350
So it only makes sense that you would
want to have a guy like Duane where that's

5969
02:49:03,351 --> 02:49:04,400
where his brain works.

5970
02:49:04,401 --> 02:49:07,350
His brain works on these
combinations and you'd want to like,

5971
02:49:07,351 --> 02:49:07,830
yeah man,

5972
02:49:07,830 --> 02:49:08,400
do that.

5973
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:12,840
Like fucking definitely keep doing that
cause he's going into these crazy deep

5974
02:49:12,841 --> 02:49:15,690
places with his techniques and
his movements and his ideas.

5975
02:49:15,930 --> 02:49:16,530
Dwayne's got,

5976
02:49:16,530 --> 02:49:16,741
he's got,

5977
02:49:16,741 --> 02:49:18,770
he's got all these
systems written down like,

5978
02:49:18,980 --> 02:49:20,310
like a lot of his,

5979
02:49:20,370 --> 02:49:21,120
his uh,

5980
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:23,910
style is documented as opposed to like,

5981
02:49:23,911 --> 02:49:25,470
a lot of people just
have it in their head.

5982
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:25,921
You know,

5983
02:49:25,921 --> 02:49:27,090
they have all their moves and their head,

5984
02:49:27,091 --> 02:49:27,711
they'd have the,

5985
02:49:27,711 --> 02:49:28,544
what they do in their head.

5986
02:49:29,850 --> 02:49:31,710
Ludwig's got all this shit written out.

5987
02:49:32,310 --> 02:49:33,450
He's a freak man.

5988
02:49:33,730 --> 02:49:34,020
Again,

5989
02:49:34,020 --> 02:49:34,561
the best,

5990
02:49:34,561 --> 02:49:36,030
most complimentary way possible.

5991
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:36,893
But he's a freak.

5992
02:49:37,080 --> 02:49:37,321
Yeah.

5993
02:49:37,321 --> 02:49:37,921
Cause see when,

5994
02:49:37,921 --> 02:49:38,161
when,

5995
02:49:38,161 --> 02:49:39,960
when Trump becomes president

5996
02:49:42,890 --> 02:49:45,440
and then society falls and,

5997
02:49:45,450 --> 02:49:47,790
and we get buried under ashes.

5998
02:49:48,590 --> 02:49:50,070
A thousand years from now,

5999
02:49:50,250 --> 02:49:55,250
somebody's going to find that manuscript
and recreate the Duane Ludwig neo

6000
02:49:55,471 --> 02:49:58,850
footwear style of striking and
they're going to build statues of,

6001
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:00,301
Dude,

6002
02:50:00,301 --> 02:50:03,440
you make me scared of the election office.

6003
02:50:03,590 --> 02:50:04,450
You're in California.

6004
02:50:04,451 --> 02:50:05,400
You got to register to vote.

6005
02:50:05,401 --> 02:50:06,330
You have two more days.

6006
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:07,230
I think folks,

6007
02:50:07,530 --> 02:50:09,240
I really think with both those guys,

6008
02:50:09,241 --> 02:50:10,590
you've got to put your wore pants on.

6009
02:50:11,490 --> 02:50:12,420
Both people running.

6010
02:50:12,450 --> 02:50:12,870
Yeah.

6011
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:16,010
Well you could vote for Gary Johnson
even though he doesn't know what it,

6012
02:50:16,220 --> 02:50:16,410
Oh,

6013
02:50:16,410 --> 02:50:17,243
is it?

6014
02:50:18,770 --> 02:50:20,030
I didn't know what Aleppo is either.

6015
02:50:20,810 --> 02:50:23,900
Apparently there was a good fight going
on here that we completely and totally

6016
02:50:23,901 --> 02:50:24,734
missed.

6017
02:50:24,950 --> 02:50:27,470
That dude looks so much like Chris Kamozi.

6018
02:50:27,471 --> 02:50:27,981
It's crazy.

6019
02:50:27,981 --> 02:50:28,260
Yeah,

6020
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:29,100
it was that Chris Carozzi.

6021
02:50:29,101 --> 02:50:29,990
His brother can't be,

6022
02:50:30,410 --> 02:50:31,243
no,

6023
02:50:33,220 --> 02:50:35,750
we're going to say I
lost my train of thought.

6024
02:50:38,330 --> 02:50:42,870
You Sea Bell Gar Rui versus Ariel Machado.

6025
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:43,733
Wow.

6026
02:50:45,150 --> 02:50:45,983
Hmm.

6027
02:50:46,350 --> 02:50:48,060
We didn't watch this fight for a second.

6028
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:55,140
As so often is the fire campaign.

6029
02:50:56,650 --> 02:50:58,620
Middleweight is a middleweight tournament.

6030
02:50:58,621 --> 02:51:00,640
So this is the first round
in the middle of a tournament

6031
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:03,390
tournament for tonight.

6032
02:51:04,620 --> 02:51:06,480
And then the next one is,

6033
02:51:06,540 --> 02:51:07,010
uh,

6034
02:51:07,010 --> 02:51:07,880
at a senior.

6035
02:51:09,740 --> 02:51:10,900
Yeah.

6036
02:51:11,220 --> 02:51:13,450
Style bender stub in there.

6037
02:51:13,860 --> 02:51:14,940
Do you know style bender?

6038
02:51:15,390 --> 02:51:16,223
I know of him.

6039
02:51:16,290 --> 02:51:16,630
I don't,

6040
02:51:16,630 --> 02:51:17,640
I don't know personally.

6041
02:51:17,730 --> 02:51:18,930
Fun Guy to watch fight.

6042
02:51:19,110 --> 02:51:19,680
Yeah,

6043
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:20,310
he's a,

6044
02:51:20,310 --> 02:51:21,550
I'm really interested to see how,

6045
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:22,470
how this goes.

6046
02:51:22,470 --> 02:51:22,801
Yeah,

6047
02:51:22,801 --> 02:51:23,490
me too.

6048
02:51:23,490 --> 02:51:24,660
He's super technical.

6049
02:51:24,661 --> 02:51:29,040
I've seen a bunch of his shit online
and he's sort of dabbling in an MMA as

6050
02:51:29,041 --> 02:51:29,371
well.

6051
02:51:29,371 --> 02:51:30,490
He's thinking about fighting him.

6052
02:51:30,980 --> 02:51:33,450
He's working hard and
doing anything and gets up,

6053
02:51:35,460 --> 02:51:36,300
but he's just like fighting.

6054
02:51:36,301 --> 02:51:38,490
I'm like the China show so
I haven't seen like the,

6055
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:42,310
like the similar competition or whatnot.

6056
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:43,790
So I'm interested to see how those go.

6057
02:51:44,850 --> 02:51:48,780
And then Robert Thomas is a got a slower,

6058
02:51:48,940 --> 02:51:49,561
I fought him.

6059
02:51:49,561 --> 02:51:51,270
He was slower but he fucking,

6060
02:51:51,690 --> 02:51:53,190
he's got like a granite chin.

6061
02:51:53,220 --> 02:51:54,390
He's got a cabbage face.

6062
02:51:55,430 --> 02:51:59,040
Like I hit that guy so fucking
hard and like he took it.

6063
02:51:59,430 --> 02:52:00,263
Wow.

6064
02:52:01,770 --> 02:52:04,050
I was thinking about the cabinets face.

6065
02:52:04,051 --> 02:52:04,884
That's fine.

6066
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:07,450
You mean that the most common,

6067
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:08,770
the nice guys.

6068
02:52:08,771 --> 02:52:09,420
Good guy.

6069
02:52:09,420 --> 02:52:10,141
He's a very,

6070
02:52:10,141 --> 02:52:12,060
he's these very talented Simon and Marcus.

6071
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:15,040
When you said that guy
he's starting to do,

6072
02:52:15,041 --> 02:52:16,660
I'm getting into some MMA.

6073
02:52:17,320 --> 02:52:19,750
When you look at like
kickboxing at this level?

6074
02:52:20,770 --> 02:52:22,420
I think like they should,

6075
02:52:22,810 --> 02:52:27,810
if they want to get an MMA kickboxing
and take like a year and really straight

6076
02:52:28,570 --> 02:52:29,880
most of the time wrestle.

6077
02:52:30,050 --> 02:52:30,340
No.

6078
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:30,740
Yeah,

6079
02:52:30,740 --> 02:52:31,571
play with the submission.

6080
02:52:31,571 --> 02:52:33,130
Played the submission
game and just learn it,

6081
02:52:33,131 --> 02:52:33,970
understand it.

6082
02:52:34,210 --> 02:52:38,650
But learn how to wrestle right
first like after their kickboxing.

6083
02:52:38,980 --> 02:52:43,960
Because when you can wrestle and you're
comfortable and confident and throwing

6084
02:52:43,961 --> 02:52:44,410
your keys,

6085
02:52:44,410 --> 02:52:46,750
throwing out your real kickboxing skills

6086
02:52:48,250 --> 02:52:50,440
and feel confident that you can defend,

6087
02:52:50,441 --> 02:52:53,070
take downs and if you do get taken down,

6088
02:52:53,090 --> 02:52:55,660
you can get back to your feet then.

6089
02:52:56,140 --> 02:52:57,490
Cause that's what MMA is now.

6090
02:52:57,730 --> 02:52:58,870
I mean the submissions,

6091
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:00,310
if you get taken down,

6092
02:53:00,311 --> 02:53:01,300
the only time you're,

6093
02:53:01,310 --> 02:53:05,620
you're seeing guys stay on top of the
icing and control position is when the

6094
02:53:05,621 --> 02:53:07,090
other guy can't really wrestle.

6095
02:53:07,490 --> 02:53:08,000
Hmm.

6096
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:08,831
You know guys,

6097
02:53:08,831 --> 02:53:11,800
you have decent takedown defense when
they do get taken out and they work back

6098
02:53:11,801 --> 02:53:12,634
to their feet.

6099
02:53:12,990 --> 02:53:14,530
Unless you're fighting Damien Maia.

6100
02:53:14,830 --> 02:53:15,663
Exactly.

6101
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:18,750
Then you're getting taken down by
a ball constructor and know he's,

6102
02:53:18,760 --> 02:53:20,260
he what he did a Rick story.

6103
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:21,890
I remember watching that going,

6104
02:53:22,090 --> 02:53:23,860
I did not think we were
ever going to see that.

6105
02:53:23,980 --> 02:53:25,480
Like stories such a gorilla.

6106
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:30,840
I mean he's such a such a physically
strong kid that to see Damien get ahold of

6107
02:53:32,141 --> 02:53:34,030
them and just constrict,

6108
02:53:34,690 --> 02:53:35,950
he just constructed them,

6109
02:53:36,160 --> 02:53:37,120
got to his back,

6110
02:53:37,270 --> 02:53:38,290
got ahold of his neck,

6111
02:53:38,291 --> 02:53:38,561
neck,

6112
02:53:38,561 --> 02:53:39,160
cranked him.

6113
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:39,993
And that was a wrap.

6114
02:53:40,360 --> 02:53:41,500
I mean the way it did it,

6115
02:53:41,501 --> 02:53:42,940
it was a stunning,

6116
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:45,250
the way he did that Carlos is stunning,

6117
02:53:45,580 --> 02:53:46,413
stunning,

6118
02:53:46,930 --> 02:53:47,440
stunning.

6119
02:53:47,440 --> 02:53:48,130
I didn't expect,

6120
02:53:48,130 --> 02:53:52,330
I expected him to be better than Carlos
and the ground by probably by a big

6121
02:53:52,331 --> 02:53:52,930
margin too.

6122
02:53:52,930 --> 02:53:57,490
But I didn't see him just kind
of walking there in my eyes.

6123
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:02,290
It's a testament to the ground game of
Roy MacDonald because Rory Mcdonald got

6124
02:54:02,291 --> 02:54:04,590
taken down by Damian in
the first round and it,

6125
02:54:04,591 --> 02:54:07,990
a lot of it was Damien on top of
him in the mouth and he defended,

6126
02:54:08,260 --> 02:54:08,951
he defended,

6127
02:54:08,951 --> 02:54:12,280
got back to his feet and then beat his
ass in the second and the third rounds

6128
02:54:12,550 --> 02:54:13,383
just stand up.

6129
02:54:13,690 --> 02:54:14,523
You know,

6130
02:54:14,680 --> 02:54:16,900
Rory underrated ground game.

6131
02:54:17,620 --> 02:54:21,460
Who did you fight and he
fought someone in Metamorris.

6132
02:54:22,890 --> 02:54:23,711
What was it like?

6133
02:54:23,711 --> 02:54:28,711
Jt Torah is like someone who was really
good and he got caught in a Kamora and

6134
02:54:28,961 --> 02:54:30,820
he's got his arm all
fucked up and he would,

6135
02:54:30,821 --> 02:54:31,654
he didn't tap,

6136
02:54:32,130 --> 02:54:34,450
I'm trying to remember who
he fought but he went to,

6137
02:54:34,480 --> 02:54:36,250
you know what they call a draw at those,

6138
02:54:36,251 --> 02:54:38,530
cause they don't really
have scores if you don't,

6139
02:54:38,980 --> 02:54:41,200
if you don't submit the
guy that goes to a draw.

6140
02:54:41,290 --> 02:54:42,040
Is that who it is?

6141
02:54:42,040 --> 02:54:42,251
Yeah,

6142
02:54:42,251 --> 02:54:47,251
it's JT Torres and Torres is super
high level kid in the grappling scene,

6143
02:54:49,210 --> 02:54:49,541
you know,

6144
02:54:49,541 --> 02:54:50,560
I mean he's a,

6145
02:54:50,590 --> 02:54:55,590
he does really well in like high level
black belt matches in the grappling.

6146
02:54:56,561 --> 02:54:59,560
So for him to step in like
that for Rory to do that,

6147
02:54:59,561 --> 02:55:04,430
while he's a professional MMA
fighter and a take on this kid,

6148
02:55:05,300 --> 02:55:06,440
super impressive.

6149
02:55:06,690 --> 02:55:07,610
And he hung in there.

6150
02:55:07,611 --> 02:55:08,121
I mean look at him.

6151
02:55:08,121 --> 02:55:09,530
He's attacking leg locks here.

6152
02:55:10,310 --> 02:55:11,143
They're both

6153
02:55:12,890 --> 02:55:14,270
exchanging heel hooks.

6154
02:55:16,270 --> 02:55:16,611
I hate you.

6155
02:55:16,611 --> 02:55:17,920
I hate looking at heel hooks.

6156
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:18,321
I know,

6157
02:55:18,321 --> 02:55:18,920
right?

6158
02:55:18,920 --> 02:55:20,710
You're waiting for that
to sound like crack,

6159
02:55:20,930 --> 02:55:21,201
crack,

6160
02:55:21,201 --> 02:55:21,591
crack,

6161
02:55:21,591 --> 02:55:22,424
crack.

6162
02:55:22,580 --> 02:55:26,300
I know that he doesn't
get finished with this.

6163
02:55:26,301 --> 02:55:26,661
He look,

6164
02:55:26,661 --> 02:55:28,010
I still don't want to look at it and know.

6165
02:55:28,011 --> 02:55:28,550
Right.

6166
02:55:28,550 --> 02:55:30,920
Cause guys get hurt even
though they don't get finished.

6167
02:55:30,921 --> 02:55:31,400
Yeah.

6168
02:55:31,400 --> 02:55:34,160
Like you don't know that they're hurt
and they keep fighting and there's some

6169
02:55:34,161 --> 02:55:37,730
inflammation and later they realize
there's a big ass tear and they're MCL or

6170
02:55:37,731 --> 02:55:38,564
something.

6171
02:55:38,770 --> 02:55:39,920
That shit happens all the time.

6172
02:55:39,921 --> 02:55:40,701
And then you walk in,

6173
02:55:40,701 --> 02:55:42,980
you feel it when you try
to walk up the stairs.

6174
02:55:43,190 --> 02:55:44,570
Have you ever had a knee surgery?

6175
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:45,411
No.

6176
02:55:45,411 --> 02:55:47,380
No knee surgeries as fortunate.

6177
02:55:47,630 --> 02:55:49,670
That's incredible for a kickboxer.

6178
02:55:49,980 --> 02:55:50,960
That's incredible.

6179
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:53,113
I've been lucky.

6180
02:55:53,210 --> 02:55:53,870
Damn,

6181
02:55:53,870 --> 02:55:54,380
that's a mate.

6182
02:55:54,380 --> 02:55:56,060
Well you must do it smart.

6183
02:55:56,061 --> 02:55:56,930
Too Smart.

6184
02:55:58,400 --> 02:55:59,280
I mean it Kinda also,

6185
02:55:59,281 --> 02:56:00,410
it seems like my thing going,

6186
02:56:00,430 --> 02:56:05,430
what was my question about a guy like
Nigga Madoff who has that insane pedal to

6187
02:56:06,711 --> 02:56:07,820
the metal style,

6188
02:56:08,060 --> 02:56:09,890
whereas you who,

6189
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:11,930
although you had a very aggressive style,

6190
02:56:11,960 --> 02:56:13,820
it was very well thought out.

6191
02:56:13,940 --> 02:56:14,360
It was,

6192
02:56:14,360 --> 02:56:14,751
there was,

6193
02:56:14,751 --> 02:56:16,640
it was very technical and your approach,

6194
02:56:18,260 --> 02:56:20,840
it's not like I'm planning,

6195
02:56:20,841 --> 02:56:22,280
I don't got the ant the idea,

6196
02:56:22,281 --> 02:56:23,540
I'm going to be technical.

6197
02:56:23,570 --> 02:56:24,800
That's just how my brain works,

6198
02:56:24,801 --> 02:56:25,340
I guess.

6199
02:56:25,340 --> 02:56:26,080
You know what I mean?

6200
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:29,630
Only because I understand that
well enough to do it that way.

6201
02:56:29,690 --> 02:56:32,440
And this is not to insinuate the
number of office and technical know.

6202
02:56:32,450 --> 02:56:33,600
Obviously he's,

6203
02:56:33,670 --> 02:56:33,890
yeah,

6204
02:56:33,890 --> 02:56:34,940
he's super technical,

6205
02:56:34,941 --> 02:56:36,740
but he's aggressive with that.

6206
02:56:37,990 --> 02:56:38,823
Yeah.

6207
02:56:39,230 --> 02:56:39,531
He,

6208
02:56:39,531 --> 02:56:42,230
he'll just kind of come after you
and go while and it turn that,

6209
02:56:42,231 --> 02:56:43,400
turn the heat up all the time.

6210
02:56:43,450 --> 02:56:45,290
I wasn't,

6211
02:56:45,470 --> 02:56:47,630
that guy is angry.

6212
02:56:47,690 --> 02:56:48,470
Yeah.

6213
02:56:48,470 --> 02:56:48,830
Yeah.

6214
02:56:48,830 --> 02:56:49,810
That's a good way to play it.

6215
02:56:49,811 --> 02:56:49,931
You know,

6216
02:56:49,931 --> 02:56:50,271
you don't,

6217
02:56:50,271 --> 02:56:51,060
you're it,

6218
02:56:51,060 --> 02:56:51,570
you,

6219
02:56:51,570 --> 02:56:53,390
you fight calm and collected.

6220
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:56,240
This dude fights calm and collected.

6221
02:56:56,530 --> 02:56:58,840
I hate to segue like I'm a fucking
professional announcer here,

6222
02:56:59,390 --> 02:57:00,890
but a style benders.

6223
02:57:00,891 --> 02:57:01,760
A bad motherfucker.

6224
02:57:01,860 --> 02:57:02,780
He looks real smooth.

6225
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:05,990
I really enjoy watching him fight and
I've been looking forward to this fight in

6226
02:57:05,991 --> 02:57:06,824
particular.

6227
02:57:07,220 --> 02:57:08,053
He's um,

6228
02:57:08,210 --> 02:57:09,110
he's a fun dude.

6229
02:57:09,111 --> 02:57:10,370
He's fun online too.

6230
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:15,200
He wrote some funny shit
about a Brendan shop and a,

6231
02:57:15,230 --> 02:57:18,320
there's two girls were having a pillow
fight and Brendan chavs concerned they're

6232
02:57:18,321 --> 02:57:19,370
going to get CTE.

6233
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:20,101
It was fun.

6234
02:57:20,101 --> 02:57:20,601
He's funny,

6235
02:57:20,601 --> 02:57:20,931
man.

6236
02:57:20,931 --> 02:57:21,800
He's a funny dude.

6237
02:57:21,801 --> 02:57:22,550
Yeah.

6238
02:57:22,550 --> 02:57:25,700
I guess like he listens to the fighter
and the kid and maybe Brennan shop's been

6239
02:57:25,701 --> 02:57:27,380
talking too much about CTE,

6240
02:57:27,800 --> 02:57:30,300
but he was just being
hilarious for Chabad,

6241
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:32,360
want to help these girls diagnose for CTE.

6242
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:36,290
But um,

6243
02:57:36,290 --> 02:57:36,710
he's,

6244
02:57:36,710 --> 02:57:37,370
he's like,

6245
02:57:37,370 --> 02:57:38,420
in my opinion,

6246
02:57:38,780 --> 02:57:39,980
when it comes to kickboxing,

6247
02:57:39,981 --> 02:57:41,900
he's the epitome of technique,

6248
02:57:42,350 --> 02:57:42,711
you know,

6249
02:57:42,711 --> 02:57:43,001
of uh,

6250
02:57:43,001 --> 02:57:43,221
of,

6251
02:57:43,221 --> 02:57:43,441
of,

6252
02:57:43,441 --> 02:57:44,630
of a technical fighter.

6253
02:57:44,631 --> 02:57:46,280
And he's also super creative.

6254
02:57:46,790 --> 02:57:49,110
I like watching them fight like hell.

6255
02:57:49,220 --> 02:57:49,731
He moved.

6256
02:57:49,731 --> 02:57:50,060
Yeah,

6257
02:57:50,060 --> 02:57:51,020
very technical.

6258
02:57:51,380 --> 02:57:56,120
He's very smart the way he fights
and he's also extremely capable.

6259
02:57:56,450 --> 02:57:56,631
You know,

6260
02:57:56,631 --> 02:57:56,841
he's,

6261
02:57:56,841 --> 02:57:58,490
he's got some extreme towns.

6262
02:57:59,410 --> 02:58:02,940
Should be interesting
because like you said a Joe,

6263
02:58:02,941 --> 02:58:04,920
he's been fighting in China a lot,

6264
02:58:04,921 --> 02:58:05,460
right?

6265
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:05,690
Yeah.

6266
02:58:05,690 --> 02:58:07,380
Law Just Europe over there.

6267
02:58:07,620 --> 02:58:09,420
He gets paid a lot to
fight over there I guess.

6268
02:58:09,900 --> 02:58:10,733
And um,

6269
02:58:10,840 --> 02:58:11,270
yeah,

6270
02:58:11,270 --> 02:58:13,680
now he's making his way to glory,

6271
02:58:13,681 --> 02:58:14,514
which is,

6272
02:58:14,670 --> 02:58:16,800
I guess this is broadcast everywhere,

6273
02:58:16,801 --> 02:58:17,220
right?

6274
02:58:17,220 --> 02:58:18,480
We're on ESPN three,

6275
02:58:18,481 --> 02:58:19,350
we're watching it right now,

6276
02:58:19,351 --> 02:58:20,210
but where,

6277
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:23,460
what are the parts of the world where
they have like 120 countries at?

6278
02:58:23,510 --> 02:58:24,650
Gloria's got there.

6279
02:58:24,830 --> 02:58:27,700
They're bigger assets are overseas.

6280
02:58:27,701 --> 02:58:28,200
I guess.

6281
02:58:28,200 --> 02:58:31,920
I was so psyched when it
got on a UFC fight pass.

6282
02:58:32,670 --> 02:58:33,390
Yeah.

6283
02:58:33,390 --> 02:58:35,100
Oh so fun.

6284
02:58:35,130 --> 02:58:36,270
Just to be able to watch,

6285
02:58:36,480 --> 02:58:37,710
like throw it up in the gym,

6286
02:58:37,711 --> 02:58:38,544
get motivated.

6287
02:58:41,650 --> 02:58:42,101
So,

6288
02:58:42,101 --> 02:58:42,700
um,

6289
02:58:42,700 --> 02:58:45,240
oh cause it's just saved
up there so you can yeah,

6290
02:58:45,250 --> 02:58:46,300
I just DVR.

6291
02:58:46,301 --> 02:58:46,501
Yeah.

6292
02:58:46,501 --> 02:58:47,200
You go to,

6293
02:58:47,200 --> 02:58:47,381
yeah.

6294
02:58:47,381 --> 02:58:47,741
You go to,

6295
02:58:47,741 --> 02:58:48,561
it's like a DVR.

6296
02:58:48,561 --> 02:58:49,780
Well I wasn't aiming rather,

6297
02:58:49,810 --> 02:58:53,110
I wasn't thrilled about it
because the sponsors sponsors.

6298
02:58:53,170 --> 02:58:53,710
Yeah.

6299
02:58:53,710 --> 02:58:54,670
When I was fighting on it.

6300
02:58:54,671 --> 02:58:56,350
And then because it was just,

6301
02:58:56,351 --> 02:58:57,184
uh,

6302
02:58:57,700 --> 02:59:00,760
he don't get ratings for oh,

6303
02:59:00,761 --> 02:59:02,050
for fight pass sponsors.

6304
02:59:02,060 --> 02:59:02,650
Yeah.

6305
02:59:02,650 --> 02:59:02,891
Right,

6306
02:59:02,891 --> 02:59:03,041
right,

6307
02:59:03,041 --> 02:59:03,251
right.

6308
02:59:03,251 --> 02:59:07,240
You wouldn't even know how many fucking
made watch Hulu or if anybody tried to

6309
02:59:07,241 --> 02:59:09,340
explain it to a sponsor
is like explaining,

6310
02:59:09,940 --> 02:59:11,140
like go to the GFL.

6311
02:59:11,141 --> 02:59:11,381
Dot.

6312
02:59:11,381 --> 02:59:12,400
Come and watch me.

6313
02:59:13,360 --> 02:59:16,420
There's a lot of people
that have fight pass,

6314
02:59:16,421 --> 02:59:19,260
but there's a lot more
people who don't have bypass.

6315
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:20,753
You know what I'm saying?

6316
02:59:21,310 --> 02:59:21,491
Like,

6317
02:59:21,491 --> 02:59:22,840
fight pass is awesome.

6318
02:59:22,930 --> 02:59:23,763
And if you're a,

6319
02:59:24,010 --> 02:59:25,360
if you really are a,

6320
02:59:25,361 --> 02:59:25,611
a,

6321
02:59:25,611 --> 02:59:28,300
a fan of MMA and you
can afford the scratch,

6322
02:59:29,500 --> 02:59:30,400
how much does it cost?

6323
02:59:30,460 --> 02:59:33,760
How much does flight
path that is so cheap.

6324
02:59:33,761 --> 02:59:34,570
Super cheap.

6325
02:59:34,570 --> 02:59:35,920
That's super cheap or cheap.

6326
02:59:36,010 --> 02:59:36,843
It's worth it.

6327
02:59:36,910 --> 02:59:40,300
Like if you're a big time fan and
if you're just becoming a fan,

6328
02:59:40,570 --> 02:59:41,920
like that's where it's even crazy.

6329
02:59:41,921 --> 02:59:42,191
Dude,

6330
02:59:42,191 --> 02:59:43,870
you missed out on all the great shit

6331
02:59:45,430 --> 02:59:46,390
but it's like a awesome,

6332
02:59:46,930 --> 02:59:47,591
awesome deal.

6333
02:59:47,591 --> 02:59:50,320
Cause all the INVICTA fights
a little life flights,

6334
02:59:50,321 --> 02:59:53,210
all the fucking shit that for everything.

6335
02:59:53,630 --> 02:59:54,520
I had this,

6336
02:59:54,550 --> 02:59:58,090
I had this crazy idea one time
I thought silly idea to um,

6337
02:59:59,050 --> 03:00:03,280
make you able to make
play lists on fight pass,

6338
03:00:03,580 --> 03:00:04,210
you know.

6339
03:00:04,210 --> 03:00:05,320
Well I'll have some,

6340
03:00:05,321 --> 03:00:07,270
some people's playlists like

6341
03:00:09,060 --> 03:00:09,630
some,

6342
03:00:09,630 --> 03:00:12,760
some of your favorite fighters playlist
on fight pass because of the fights that

6343
03:00:12,761 --> 03:00:14,500
inspired them to come and do this thing.

6344
03:00:14,670 --> 03:00:15,800
Yeah.

6345
03:00:16,330 --> 03:00:16,870
Dude,

6346
03:00:16,870 --> 03:00:18,310
that's a great idea.

6347
03:00:18,400 --> 03:00:19,390
That's a great idea.

6348
03:00:19,420 --> 03:00:20,590
That should be an option.

6349
03:00:20,620 --> 03:00:21,310
Like a,

6350
03:00:21,310 --> 03:00:22,210
on your fight pass,

6351
03:00:22,211 --> 03:00:25,210
you should be able to have a
star and you can add it to a,

6352
03:00:25,211 --> 03:00:25,660
uh,

6353
03:00:25,660 --> 03:00:26,680
added to a collection.

6354
03:00:26,681 --> 03:00:27,220
Yeah,

6355
03:00:27,220 --> 03:00:27,491
dude,

6356
03:00:27,491 --> 03:00:28,121
that's slick.

6357
03:00:28,121 --> 03:00:28,954
I like that.

6358
03:00:28,990 --> 03:00:30,790
Then you would like be
able to find like what,

6359
03:00:30,940 --> 03:00:32,350
what would don Frye pick?

6360
03:00:33,900 --> 03:00:34,810
You know what I'm saying?

6361
03:00:34,960 --> 03:00:35,341
Well goods,

6362
03:00:35,341 --> 03:00:37,450
Don fries all time favorite fights.

6363
03:00:37,870 --> 03:00:38,111
You know,

6364
03:00:38,111 --> 03:00:39,250
it's going to be a slobber,

6365
03:00:39,251 --> 03:00:40,084
knocker

6366
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:47,250
style bender.

6367
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:51,240
All kinds of weird ads on his shorts.

6368
03:00:51,270 --> 03:00:53,340
What's up with those shorts
that just has a lot of,

6369
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:55,650
I thought that was a bunch of flags.

6370
03:00:55,730 --> 03:00:57,450
Like a tiger tiger,

6371
03:00:57,870 --> 03:00:58,950
a pink tiger.

6372
03:00:59,040 --> 03:00:59,801
What do you see in here?

6373
03:00:59,801 --> 03:01:02,050
Joe talked us through this
at the coochie shorts.

6374
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:02,950
Ooh,

6375
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:03,783
beautiful.

6376
03:01:03,790 --> 03:01:04,481
Beautiful question.

6377
03:01:04,481 --> 03:01:05,314
Mark kick.

6378
03:01:05,710 --> 03:01:06,670
What do you see in here Joe?

6379
03:01:06,671 --> 03:01:07,504
When you watch them?

6380
03:01:08,520 --> 03:01:09,510
Uh,

6381
03:01:10,380 --> 03:01:11,400
cause you know Thomas,

6382
03:01:11,401 --> 03:01:12,234
right?

6383
03:01:12,450 --> 03:01:13,200
Yeah,

6384
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:14,040
you fought him.

6385
03:01:14,370 --> 03:01:14,670
He had a,

6386
03:01:14,670 --> 03:01:15,503
Thomas is a,

6387
03:01:15,540 --> 03:01:17,130
as actually the right now is watching.

6388
03:01:17,160 --> 03:01:20,790
Thomas looks a little different than
he's got a little more head movement.

6389
03:01:20,820 --> 03:01:21,090
Uh,

6390
03:01:21,090 --> 03:01:22,800
and he's more of a boxing stance.

6391
03:01:22,940 --> 03:01:23,773
Ooh.

6392
03:01:24,110 --> 03:01:25,200
Thrown decent punches.

6393
03:01:25,350 --> 03:01:26,250
He used to have these,

6394
03:01:26,251 --> 03:01:31,110
like Thomas used to have this overly Thai
style and I mean it's like these guys

6395
03:01:31,111 --> 03:01:35,980
that try to fight and try to mimic
and copy a traditional Moitai.

6396
03:01:36,390 --> 03:01:36,840
Hmm.

6397
03:01:36,840 --> 03:01:37,441
And uh,

6398
03:01:37,441 --> 03:01:39,780
at one it doesn't work when
you're that big in my opinion.

6399
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:42,990
And it in this style of rules is not good.

6400
03:01:43,680 --> 03:01:44,460
Interesting.

6401
03:01:44,460 --> 03:01:45,630
Suppose the kickboxing,

6402
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:47,550
why do you think it doesn't
work when you're that big?

6403
03:01:47,580 --> 03:01:50,340
Because a traditional way time,

6404
03:01:50,341 --> 03:01:54,720
when I say that is all about like body
cakes and it's like a very upright,

6405
03:01:54,721 --> 03:01:55,560
you stand very,

6406
03:01:55,680 --> 03:01:57,630
very upright and it's a slow pace thing.

6407
03:01:58,380 --> 03:02:01,560
And I think that the guys
that are creative that uh,

6408
03:02:02,040 --> 03:02:02,670
you know,

6409
03:02:02,670 --> 03:02:05,610
makes their punches and the kicks up
and we used different movement have more

6410
03:02:05,611 --> 03:02:09,090
like an American kickboxing style
or a Dutch kickboxing style,

6411
03:02:09,091 --> 03:02:13,350
a different style than the traditional
way ties route I think is more effective

6412
03:02:13,351 --> 03:02:15,570
than the rules are set up for that.

6413
03:02:15,970 --> 03:02:19,450
Well why do you think it's more effective
with people that are heavier though?

6414
03:02:20,140 --> 03:02:21,220
I'm just going to slow.

6415
03:02:21,770 --> 03:02:22,603
Slow.

6416
03:02:23,620 --> 03:02:24,071
Interesting.

6417
03:02:24,071 --> 03:02:24,520
So,

6418
03:02:24,520 --> 03:02:25,610
so like the,

6419
03:02:26,170 --> 03:02:29,590
the guys who are shorter or the smaller
guys that was a nice light tech.

6420
03:02:30,010 --> 03:02:31,480
The guys who were smaller,

6421
03:02:31,510 --> 03:02:32,343
like the

6422
03:02:33,820 --> 03:02:35,740
elite guys at the lighter weight classes,

6423
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:36,370
they could,

6424
03:02:36,370 --> 03:02:39,190
they could move quick enough
to pull off that upward stance.

6425
03:02:39,200 --> 03:02:39,590
Yes.

6426
03:02:39,590 --> 03:02:40,020
So the whole,

6427
03:02:40,020 --> 03:02:44,270
like if you think about like Moitai like
it was designed as like a martial arts

6428
03:02:44,271 --> 03:02:47,150
for a bunch of people that are 135 pounds.

6429
03:02:47,330 --> 03:02:47,720
Right?

6430
03:02:47,720 --> 03:02:48,290
Cops,

6431
03:02:48,290 --> 03:02:49,123
you know,

6432
03:02:50,600 --> 03:02:51,433
but the,

6433
03:02:51,500 --> 03:02:56,240
and the way the rules for traditional
Muy Thai does the slow paced five round

6434
03:02:56,241 --> 03:02:56,451
fight.

6435
03:02:56,451 --> 03:02:57,650
It's like a really slow pace.

6436
03:02:58,160 --> 03:02:59,690
It's all about um,

6437
03:03:01,690 --> 03:03:02,523
uh,

6438
03:03:03,380 --> 03:03:03,780
uh,

6439
03:03:03,780 --> 03:03:04,640
way slower pace.

6440
03:03:04,641 --> 03:03:05,540
It's about gambling.

6441
03:03:05,600 --> 03:03:06,770
It's just really different.

6442
03:03:07,150 --> 03:03:10,430
And we'd go watch it and then they tried
to copy it and then they a fight at a

6443
03:03:10,431 --> 03:03:12,260
slow pace going to send
you just cracked him.

6444
03:03:13,910 --> 03:03:15,230
Is it about being tougher?

6445
03:03:15,680 --> 03:03:16,940
Like the traditional style?

6446
03:03:16,941 --> 03:03:17,280
Is that,

6447
03:03:17,280 --> 03:03:18,800
does that Kinda what you mean or no,

6448
03:03:18,801 --> 03:03:19,590
not at all.

6449
03:03:19,590 --> 03:03:20,510
No.

6450
03:03:21,990 --> 03:03:22,431
It's like,

6451
03:03:22,431 --> 03:03:22,811
why?

6452
03:03:22,811 --> 03:03:24,410
Like it seems like I,

6453
03:03:24,411 --> 03:03:25,244
when I think about it,

6454
03:03:25,250 --> 03:03:26,330
traditional Thai style,

6455
03:03:26,331 --> 03:03:31,331
it's Kinda screaming up and throwing
straight straight shots and trying to land

6456
03:03:32,271 --> 03:03:33,410
that hard kick to the body.

6457
03:03:33,440 --> 03:03:35,120
Robert Thomas looks way different.

6458
03:03:37,070 --> 03:03:38,090
What looks different about him?

6459
03:03:38,091 --> 03:03:38,470
He's like,

6460
03:03:38,470 --> 03:03:39,470
wait a lot more.

6461
03:03:39,471 --> 03:03:40,550
Turned into his stance.

6462
03:03:40,551 --> 03:03:43,180
He's got way more of a boxing stance
as opposed to having like where he had

6463
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:43,611
before.

6464
03:03:43,611 --> 03:03:44,570
He was really squared up.

6465
03:03:45,100 --> 03:03:45,290
Uh,

6466
03:03:45,290 --> 03:03:46,510
he's sitting down in his punch.

6467
03:03:46,530 --> 03:03:47,241
He's sitting down.

6468
03:03:47,241 --> 03:03:49,460
Where so you see a lot of improvement?

6469
03:03:49,461 --> 03:03:50,180
Yeah,

6470
03:03:50,180 --> 03:03:50,660
I mean,

6471
03:03:50,660 --> 03:03:50,901
yeah,

6472
03:03:50,901 --> 03:03:53,260
for my liking and then uh,

6473
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:55,130
he's being a lot more
aggressive with his hands.

6474
03:03:55,940 --> 03:03:58,100
So it really good glory.

6475
03:03:58,101 --> 03:03:58,940
37,

6476
03:03:59,000 --> 03:03:59,781
Los Angeles,

6477
03:03:59,781 --> 03:04:00,890
January 20th.

6478
03:04:02,940 --> 03:04:03,560
Um,

6479
03:04:03,560 --> 03:04:06,020
you said lion fight is on fight pass.

6480
03:04:06,050 --> 03:04:07,070
Is it on fight pass?

6481
03:04:07,460 --> 03:04:07,851
I think.

6482
03:04:07,851 --> 03:04:09,990
I think I heard a couple of really?

6483
03:04:10,690 --> 03:04:11,090
Yeah.

6484
03:04:11,090 --> 03:04:12,560
I didn't know lion fight was on it too.

6485
03:04:12,561 --> 03:04:13,394
I thought they were,

6486
03:04:14,660 --> 03:04:15,261
I could be wrong,

6487
03:04:15,261 --> 03:04:16,094
but I'm pretty,

6488
03:04:16,130 --> 03:04:16,963
I don't think I am.

6489
03:04:19,010 --> 03:04:19,780
What's so funny,

6490
03:04:19,780 --> 03:04:20,830
I was just as like,

6491
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:22,940
if Abella Toy fipass

6492
03:04:25,410 --> 03:04:26,243
poor bell.

6493
03:04:26,910 --> 03:04:28,460
How do you guys see this fight somewhere?

6494
03:04:29,180 --> 03:04:29,530
Uh,

6495
03:04:29,530 --> 03:04:31,620
it's interesting Thomas.

6496
03:04:31,890 --> 03:04:32,340
Uh,

6497
03:04:32,340 --> 03:04:33,240
like you said,

6498
03:04:33,450 --> 03:04:34,560
he's definitely,

6499
03:04:34,561 --> 03:04:35,850
it seems to me he looks like

6500
03:04:35,990 --> 03:04:37,870
a better fighter than he
was when he fought you.

6501
03:04:37,910 --> 03:04:40,550
Thomas used to not like use
his hands like aggressively.

6502
03:04:40,580 --> 03:04:41,420
So I didn't think he did.

6503
03:04:41,540 --> 03:04:44,590
And I told him after the
vice work on his boxing line,

6504
03:04:44,810 --> 03:04:48,860
but he used to be all about like this
step up me and this body kick and I

6505
03:04:48,861 --> 03:04:50,210
haven't seen him try to do that at all.

6506
03:04:50,211 --> 03:04:51,290
And He's thinking much,

6507
03:04:51,291 --> 03:04:53,450
sit sitting down a lot
better and it stands.

6508
03:04:54,350 --> 03:04:55,660
I don't know if he's
winning on points or not,

6509
03:04:55,661 --> 03:04:56,494
but

6510
03:04:57,430 --> 03:04:58,263
hey Janice,

6511
03:04:58,280 --> 03:04:59,300
you say it out of Sonia.

6512
03:04:59,301 --> 03:05:00,134
I've been saying,

6513
03:05:00,170 --> 03:05:02,030
how have I been saying I
didn't know how to say it.

6514
03:05:02,031 --> 03:05:02,864
I said

6515
03:05:04,040 --> 03:05:05,120
the shorts are dope though.

6516
03:05:05,340 --> 03:05:06,170
Yeah.

6517
03:05:06,170 --> 03:05:08,280
It's like I look kind of like fuck.

6518
03:05:08,281 --> 03:05:11,150
I see it's stuck on my brain
now because monitoring.

6519
03:05:11,390 --> 03:05:14,240
Well I think you know Robert
Thomas looks good here.

6520
03:05:14,530 --> 03:05:15,363
What are you going to say?

6521
03:05:15,710 --> 03:05:16,840
Oh,

6522
03:05:16,880 --> 03:05:17,451
the body.

6523
03:05:17,451 --> 03:05:18,284
Nice.

6524
03:05:19,790 --> 03:05:20,623
Damn.

6525
03:05:21,850 --> 03:05:22,560
Ooh,

6526
03:05:22,560 --> 03:05:23,400
the solar plex.

6527
03:05:23,401 --> 03:05:24,150
I don't know.

6528
03:05:24,150 --> 03:05:24,990
It might be it.

6529
03:05:24,991 --> 03:05:25,261
Yeah,

6530
03:05:25,261 --> 03:05:26,094
that was a bad one.

6531
03:05:28,120 --> 03:05:28,471
Wow.

6532
03:05:28,471 --> 03:05:30,320
He got back up at nine Taylor.

6533
03:05:30,330 --> 03:05:31,081
That was a tough one.

6534
03:05:31,081 --> 03:05:32,100
Jesus Christ.

6535
03:05:33,950 --> 03:05:34,411
This claim.

6536
03:05:34,411 --> 03:05:35,180
I don't cause I'm like,

6537
03:05:35,180 --> 03:05:37,220
it wasn't like trying to
fight on ballot though.

6538
03:05:37,500 --> 03:05:39,960
So no fight bath of gobble everything.

6539
03:05:39,961 --> 03:05:40,531
I know,

6540
03:05:40,531 --> 03:05:40,771
right?

6541
03:05:40,771 --> 03:05:42,360
It's cool to put everything in one spot.

6542
03:05:43,670 --> 03:05:44,700
It's like Netflix.

6543
03:05:44,790 --> 03:05:47,190
I personally route for Bella tour.

6544
03:05:48,030 --> 03:05:48,863
I really do.

6545
03:05:48,960 --> 03:05:52,530
I think it's good for
everybody to have more events.

6546
03:05:52,740 --> 03:05:53,910
I think it's good for the sport.

6547
03:05:53,970 --> 03:05:55,170
It elevates a sport.

6548
03:05:55,620 --> 03:05:56,850
I don't think it's bad for the UFC.

6549
03:05:56,851 --> 03:05:58,200
I think the UFC is giant.

6550
03:05:58,620 --> 03:05:59,670
It's only going to get bigger.

6551
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:01,980
I don't think it's bad that
Bella toward does good.

6552
03:06:02,490 --> 03:06:04,170
And I think it's great the way there,

6553
03:06:04,230 --> 03:06:07,710
what they're doing now where they're
taking fighters who you know did well in

6554
03:06:07,711 --> 03:06:10,920
the UFC and maybe it didn't work out
for them or maybe they decided to try to

6555
03:06:10,921 --> 03:06:12,930
chest her options like Rory Macdonald,

6556
03:06:13,260 --> 03:06:14,310
Phil Davis,

6557
03:06:14,510 --> 03:06:15,090
you know,

6558
03:06:15,090 --> 03:06:16,650
they're developing a real roster.

6559
03:06:16,710 --> 03:06:17,543
Yeah.

6560
03:06:17,880 --> 03:06:19,350
And Lori's Worldclass,

6561
03:06:19,380 --> 03:06:21,930
he's a worldclass welterweight
in anybody's book.

6562
03:06:21,960 --> 03:06:25,440
What happens because of that is because
now you bring these guys with that UFC

6563
03:06:25,441 --> 03:06:26,910
level experience cause it's all,

6564
03:06:26,911 --> 03:06:27,061
yeah.

6565
03:06:27,061 --> 03:06:31,710
Some of those bell told guys can walk
right into the UFC and do well Michael

6566
03:06:31,710 --> 03:06:31,830
Chandler.

6567
03:06:31,830 --> 03:06:32,041
Yeah,

6568
03:06:32,041 --> 03:06:32,874
exactly.

6569
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:34,410
But not all of them.

6570
03:06:34,650 --> 03:06:34,890
Right.

6571
03:06:34,890 --> 03:06:38,250
But when you bring that UFC level
experience back to the Bella cage,

6572
03:06:38,520 --> 03:06:39,870
then that rate,

6573
03:06:39,871 --> 03:06:42,330
that's the same thing that I've
seen before about that void.

6574
03:06:43,400 --> 03:06:46,080
There's a point now these
guys can raise their level.

6575
03:06:46,081 --> 03:06:48,180
Some the guys that aren't there,

6576
03:06:48,210 --> 03:06:50,100
but they're in that environment.

6577
03:06:50,490 --> 03:06:51,323
Right.

6578
03:06:51,480 --> 03:06:52,350
You would know this.

6579
03:06:52,351 --> 03:06:53,460
You're in the loop.

6580
03:06:53,610 --> 03:06:58,280
What happened with Ben Ascaris [inaudible]
why did he not go back to bell tour?

6581
03:06:58,300 --> 03:06:59,280
He was the champion.

6582
03:06:59,510 --> 03:07:04,510
Like that's so rare that a champion leaves
with the belt and winds up going and

6583
03:07:05,491 --> 03:07:06,540
fighting somewhere else.

6584
03:07:06,630 --> 03:07:06,990
Yeah.

6585
03:07:06,990 --> 03:07:08,520
I don't remember at all.

6586
03:07:08,550 --> 03:07:10,080
I know I asked them about,

6587
03:07:10,110 --> 03:07:11,430
oh how convenient.

6588
03:07:14,190 --> 03:07:15,023
No,

6589
03:07:16,800 --> 03:07:17,970
I vaguely remember,

6590
03:07:18,060 --> 03:07:22,140
he's the one guy that troubles me the
most out of all the people that are not

6591
03:07:22,141 --> 03:07:23,610
competing right now in the UFC.

6592
03:07:23,940 --> 03:07:26,550
He's the one guy that
troubles me the most because,

6593
03:07:26,551 --> 03:07:27,384
uh,

6594
03:07:27,780 --> 03:07:30,090
I would want to see what he can do.

6595
03:07:30,450 --> 03:07:31,470
I want to see what he can do.

6596
03:07:31,770 --> 03:07:32,160
He's,

6597
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:32,431
I mean,

6598
03:07:32,431 --> 03:07:35,940
people say that his style is boring or
that they don't like it cause he just

6599
03:07:35,941 --> 03:07:39,510
gets on top of guys and becomes a
blanket and punched him in the face.

6600
03:07:39,690 --> 03:07:39,930
Mike.

6601
03:07:39,930 --> 03:07:40,291
Yeah,

6602
03:07:40,291 --> 03:07:42,150
but he can do that.

6603
03:07:42,480 --> 03:07:42,631
Like,

6604
03:07:42,631 --> 03:07:46,110
don't you think it's imperative
that we show what can be done?

6605
03:07:46,140 --> 03:07:47,940
Like can he do that to Damien Maia?

6606
03:07:47,970 --> 03:07:49,560
I want to know who we can do it too.

6607
03:07:49,860 --> 03:07:50,880
I want to know who we could do it too.

6608
03:07:50,881 --> 03:07:51,720
And there's only one way.

6609
03:07:51,721 --> 03:07:52,140
Look,

6610
03:07:52,140 --> 03:07:53,520
he's done it to a lot of people.

6611
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:54,780
Look what he did to Korskoff.

6612
03:07:54,990 --> 03:07:55,301
You know how,

6613
03:07:55,301 --> 03:07:57,330
what a bad motherfucker cars cough is,

6614
03:07:59,130 --> 03:07:59,540
right?

6615
03:07:59,540 --> 03:07:59,710
Yeah,

6616
03:07:59,710 --> 03:07:59,950
man,

6617
03:07:59,950 --> 03:08:00,150
man.

6618
03:08:00,150 --> 03:08:01,820
Manhandle them a have them.

6619
03:08:02,030 --> 03:08:03,600
I'm really on that.

6620
03:08:03,601 --> 03:08:04,434
I'm really on that.

6621
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:05,461
A lot of dudes,

6622
03:08:05,461 --> 03:08:06,240
he mugs him.

6623
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:07,080
That's what you do.

6624
03:08:07,300 --> 03:08:08,131
That's the fight.

6625
03:08:08,131 --> 03:08:09,640
You bring him into the UFC to flat.

6626
03:08:09,830 --> 03:08:10,320
Yeah.

6627
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:12,610
Put Him in Damien Maia is a coal main on,

6628
03:08:12,660 --> 03:08:12,880
on,

6629
03:08:12,880 --> 03:08:13,191
on a,

6630
03:08:13,191 --> 03:08:13,740
on a,

6631
03:08:13,740 --> 03:08:16,580
on a bank card or or put him with a,

6632
03:08:16,780 --> 03:08:17,100
uh,

6633
03:08:17,100 --> 03:08:19,950
exciting young kid who's
going to come after him,

6634
03:08:20,700 --> 03:08:21,533
you know,

6635
03:08:21,780 --> 03:08:22,613
put them in their own.

6636
03:08:22,930 --> 03:08:23,550
Yeah.

6637
03:08:23,550 --> 03:08:24,383
There you go.

6638
03:08:24,810 --> 03:08:25,643
Mike Perry.

6639
03:08:25,830 --> 03:08:26,241
Someone.

6640
03:08:26,241 --> 03:08:27,810
Someone who's going to do something crazy.

6641
03:08:28,260 --> 03:08:29,910
Go out and throw wild punches at him.

6642
03:08:30,330 --> 03:08:30,781
Make it up.

6643
03:08:30,781 --> 03:08:32,400
Make it a fucking scrap look.

6644
03:08:32,550 --> 03:08:35,490
One of his toughest fights
in Belterra was Jay Heran.

6645
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:35,850
Yep.

6646
03:08:35,850 --> 03:08:36,683
Right.

6647
03:08:36,860 --> 03:08:37,693
Jason Wrestle.

6648
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:38,580
Yeah.

6649
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:39,413
Jake and Russell.

6650
03:08:39,980 --> 03:08:40,460
Jay's,

6651
03:08:40,460 --> 03:08:41,130
uh,

6652
03:08:41,130 --> 03:08:45,990
he's a very good MMA fighter and he can
wrestle and so that he was better in the

6653
03:08:45,991 --> 03:08:47,310
striking then.

6654
03:08:48,450 --> 03:08:49,800
Then aspirin was at the time.

6655
03:08:49,801 --> 03:08:50,634
Right.

6656
03:08:50,970 --> 03:08:51,691
But asking to strike,

6657
03:08:51,691 --> 03:08:52,560
he's not that bad either.

6658
03:08:52,561 --> 03:08:54,210
He knows how the fuck get away from Shit.

6659
03:08:54,240 --> 03:08:54,720
Yup.

6660
03:08:54,720 --> 03:08:55,920
And when he gets a hold of guys,

6661
03:08:55,921 --> 03:08:58,440
he takes him down these ways
that just not expecting,

6662
03:08:58,470 --> 03:09:00,100
I really want to see him in my,

6663
03:09:00,101 --> 03:09:00,811
and now fuck.

6664
03:09:00,811 --> 03:09:01,770
Yeah Dude,

6665
03:09:01,771 --> 03:09:03,330
I want to see him in a lot of guys.

6666
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:04,920
I want to see him in Wonderboy.

6667
03:09:04,950 --> 03:09:05,940
That's what I want to see.

6668
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:06,930
I mean,

6669
03:09:06,930 --> 03:09:07,950
wouldn't you want to see that?

6670
03:09:08,580 --> 03:09:09,720
Can you take that dude down?

6671
03:09:09,721 --> 03:09:10,441
Can you get ahold of them?

6672
03:09:10,441 --> 03:09:11,580
Can you get past those kicks?

6673
03:09:11,970 --> 03:09:12,570
Like what's going gonna?

6674
03:09:12,570 --> 03:09:13,710
What's going to happen there?

6675
03:09:14,460 --> 03:09:15,293
Fuck man.

6676
03:09:15,540 --> 03:09:19,710
It's like there's not a whole lot of
guys that are specialists in and that's

6677
03:09:19,770 --> 03:09:22,440
much of a pure sense as he is.

6678
03:09:22,770 --> 03:09:27,770
He's a wrestling specialist and he's a
real world class wrestler and anytime

6679
03:09:29,521 --> 03:09:31,050
there's a guy like that out there for me,

6680
03:09:31,051 --> 03:09:32,280
it's just like shit.

6681
03:09:33,090 --> 03:09:33,301
Yeah.

6682
03:09:33,301 --> 03:09:38,130
Especially when when they come in with
a different style of that specialty,

6683
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:41,300
like askern style isn't the same.

6684
03:09:41,340 --> 03:09:42,070
I mean,

6685
03:09:42,070 --> 03:09:44,430
no magna Madoff is a
specialist as a wrestler,

6686
03:09:44,460 --> 03:09:46,350
but [inaudible] style is different.

6687
03:09:46,410 --> 03:09:47,100
Exactly.

6688
03:09:47,100 --> 03:09:49,080
African style is just bizarre.

6689
03:09:49,710 --> 03:09:51,970
It just holds onto guys and weird way.

6690
03:09:52,390 --> 03:09:53,223
Nice.

6691
03:09:53,690 --> 03:09:56,830
And he just seems so much
stronger than he looks.

6692
03:09:57,250 --> 03:09:58,480
He's very interesting man.

6693
03:09:58,600 --> 03:09:59,433
But just,

6694
03:09:59,500 --> 03:10:02,560
I hate to bring that up again,

6695
03:10:02,561 --> 03:10:07,210
but the only reason why I do is
because I am a fan of the sport.

6696
03:10:07,750 --> 03:10:11,560
I'm a big fan of the sport and I don't
think the sport is the most exciting

6697
03:10:11,561 --> 03:10:12,280
shit.

6698
03:10:12,280 --> 03:10:14,980
I think the sport is the sport.

6699
03:10:15,430 --> 03:10:19,640
If there's something that's not
as exciting but is more effective,

6700
03:10:19,660 --> 03:10:23,890
that's still a part of the sport and you
can't ignore that something just cause

6701
03:10:23,891 --> 03:10:28,660
it's convenient for your vision of
what makes a sport dynamic and exciting

6702
03:10:28,840 --> 03:10:32,440
because then stopped the sport anymore
because then it's the sport plus

6703
03:10:32,441 --> 03:10:33,130
entertainment.

6704
03:10:33,130 --> 03:10:34,420
But this guy's going to stink it up.

6705
03:10:34,540 --> 03:10:37,570
We're going to keep them on
the outside and he might not,

6706
03:10:37,571 --> 03:10:40,570
I mean it might be Jay hair on squared.

6707
03:10:40,660 --> 03:10:44,560
You get him in with or with someone
like a wonderful boy or Tyron Woodley or

6708
03:10:44,561 --> 03:10:45,730
someone along those lines,

6709
03:10:45,731 --> 03:10:45,971
you know,

6710
03:10:45,971 --> 03:10:46,570
entire name.

6711
03:10:46,570 --> 03:10:47,410
They know each other.

6712
03:10:47,560 --> 03:10:48,311
Go right there.

6713
03:10:48,311 --> 03:10:48,980
Their teammates,

6714
03:10:48,980 --> 03:10:49,570
they fight.

6715
03:10:49,570 --> 03:10:50,050
No,

6716
03:10:50,050 --> 03:10:50,510
no,

6717
03:10:50,510 --> 03:10:51,160
they wouldn't.

6718
03:10:51,160 --> 03:10:52,360
I don't think they would fight.

6719
03:10:52,600 --> 03:10:54,310
I doubt they would
fight even for the belt.

6720
03:10:54,790 --> 03:10:55,623
Wow.

6721
03:10:56,260 --> 03:10:59,620
Well that would be an interesting
fight if they weren't that good friends

6722
03:10:59,680 --> 03:11:02,470
stylistically because Tyron is a
really good wrestler too and that,

6723
03:11:02,560 --> 03:11:03,910
but they know power.

6724
03:11:03,940 --> 03:11:04,930
He know each other to.

6725
03:11:04,931 --> 03:11:06,310
I think I honestly,

6726
03:11:06,311 --> 03:11:07,121
in an MMA fight,

6727
03:11:07,121 --> 03:11:11,380
I think it's bad for Ben simply because
they know each other so well and Tyron

6728
03:11:11,381 --> 03:11:13,550
is more explosive with the striking.

6729
03:11:13,810 --> 03:11:14,290
Oh,

6730
03:11:14,290 --> 03:11:14,830
oh,

6731
03:11:14,830 --> 03:11:15,370
oh,

6732
03:11:15,370 --> 03:11:16,280
oh ow.

6733
03:11:16,700 --> 03:11:18,310
I say that style bender.

6734
03:11:18,430 --> 03:11:19,270
It's no joke

6735
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:23,560
standing up

6736
03:11:25,360 --> 03:11:26,650
just 15 seconds ago.

6737
03:11:26,651 --> 03:11:28,680
He's going to survive is caught.

6738
03:11:28,710 --> 03:11:29,543
Shit.

6739
03:11:34,450 --> 03:11:35,150
Okay.

6740
03:11:35,150 --> 03:11:35,600
Whoa.

6741
03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:37,100
Beautiful combination there.

6742
03:11:37,130 --> 03:11:38,060
Oh right hand.

6743
03:11:38,520 --> 03:11:39,330
Ooh,

6744
03:11:39,330 --> 03:11:40,163
Ooh

6745
03:11:44,090 --> 03:11:44,330
short.

6746
03:11:44,330 --> 03:11:46,100
It's a dope as fuck they are.

6747
03:11:47,180 --> 03:11:48,860
It's a fun guy to watch man.

6748
03:11:48,861 --> 03:11:49,694
It good fight.

6749
03:11:50,590 --> 03:11:51,423
Okay.

6750
03:11:51,750 --> 03:11:53,010
Robert Thomas look a lot better though.

6751
03:11:53,660 --> 03:11:54,493
Good.

6752
03:11:58,300 --> 03:12:00,640
So that was a round one
of the tournament for him.

6753
03:12:00,641 --> 03:12:00,881
Right.

6754
03:12:00,881 --> 03:12:04,780
So he might have to say if he wins
this then he fights in the next year.

6755
03:12:04,800 --> 03:12:05,350
Who won?

6756
03:12:05,350 --> 03:12:06,280
Who were paying attention?

6757
03:12:06,281 --> 03:12:07,930
We weren't paying attention to at all.

6758
03:12:08,410 --> 03:12:09,430
Not even a little.

6759
03:12:11,700 --> 03:12:12,290
Jamie Solomon.

6760
03:12:12,290 --> 03:12:13,123
Paul,

6761
03:12:15,190 --> 03:12:19,120
this is another fight that I'm really
interested in or style matchup I'm really

6762
03:12:19,121 --> 03:12:24,121
interested in is that explosive speed
of tiring versus that slow methodical

6763
03:12:24,191 --> 03:12:25,510
style of Maya too.

6764
03:12:25,511 --> 03:12:26,410
That's another one.

6765
03:12:26,411 --> 03:12:26,870
Like kitten.

6766
03:12:26,870 --> 03:12:28,420
Can he take tire it down?

6767
03:12:28,720 --> 03:12:29,300
That's in here.

6768
03:12:29,300 --> 03:12:33,310
Get to Chiron and you're going to have
to go through hell to get to them because

6769
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:35,290
there's no question in the world,

6770
03:12:35,470 --> 03:12:38,590
there's no question in my mind at
least the Tyron moves far faster,

6771
03:12:38,800 --> 03:12:39,041
right?

6772
03:12:39,041 --> 03:12:41,650
So he's a very difficult
to get ahold of grappler,

6773
03:12:41,750 --> 03:12:42,190
right.

6774
03:12:42,190 --> 03:12:42,820
Anyway.

6775
03:12:42,820 --> 03:12:43,120
Right.

6776
03:12:43,120 --> 03:12:43,930
Very good wrestling.

6777
03:12:43,930 --> 03:12:47,320
And then he moves far faster
and he's got thunderous power.

6778
03:12:47,590 --> 03:12:49,510
So mine is going to have to take chances.

6779
03:12:49,750 --> 03:12:50,980
So in taking those chances,

6780
03:12:51,050 --> 03:12:51,831
close that distance,

6781
03:12:51,831 --> 03:12:52,300
he's,

6782
03:12:52,300 --> 03:12:53,720
he's not kicking specialist either,

6783
03:12:53,721 --> 03:12:57,260
so he's going to be taking those chances
with his hands and you're just going to

6784
03:12:57,261 --> 03:12:58,940
run into these potential counters,

6785
03:12:58,941 --> 03:13:00,350
especially in the first round for,

6786
03:13:00,351 --> 03:13:01,184
for anybody.

6787
03:13:01,430 --> 03:13:05,990
Tyron is the scariest and the first round
because he just has so much speed and

6788
03:13:05,991 --> 03:13:07,790
explosion and I think it takes,

6789
03:13:07,791 --> 03:13:10,090
guys were surprised
they day to my surprise.

6790
03:13:10,100 --> 03:13:14,870
And it probably takes them at least
around or about around to adjust to that

6791
03:13:14,871 --> 03:13:15,560
speed.

6792
03:13:15,560 --> 03:13:16,700
At the very least,

6793
03:13:17,030 --> 03:13:19,010
there's been some knock
outs like the Josh,

6794
03:13:19,050 --> 03:13:19,883
Tom,

6795
03:13:21,020 --> 03:13:22,270
Josh Koscheck knockout.

6796
03:13:22,280 --> 03:13:22,791
Remember that one?

6797
03:13:22,791 --> 03:13:23,150
Yup.

6798
03:13:23,150 --> 03:13:24,110
Oh my goodness.

6799
03:13:25,100 --> 03:13:26,090
Oh my goodness.

6800
03:13:27,230 --> 03:13:28,063
Just,

6801
03:13:28,100 --> 03:13:31,190
just a fucking bomb over the top.

6802
03:13:32,390 --> 03:13:33,160
Yeah.

6803
03:13:33,160 --> 03:13:33,561
The way,

6804
03:13:33,561 --> 03:13:34,394
the way he was.

6805
03:13:34,850 --> 03:13:38,600
I can picture it in my head and the
way he's standing up over him in that,

6806
03:13:38,601 --> 03:13:42,050
in that it's kind of scary.

6807
03:13:42,400 --> 03:13:44,300
It looks scary when you see,

6808
03:13:44,301 --> 03:13:44,930
cause they're both,

6809
03:13:44,930 --> 03:13:47,210
it looks like two superhero
has just gotten into a fight.

6810
03:13:47,530 --> 03:13:48,363
Yeah.

6811
03:13:50,300 --> 03:13:51,860
Yeah man.

6812
03:13:52,520 --> 03:13:53,960
Caustics another guy.

6813
03:13:54,020 --> 03:13:55,520
What a fucking accomplished wrestler.

6814
03:13:55,521 --> 03:13:56,321
That guy was four.

6815
03:13:56,321 --> 03:13:57,220
You got an MMA,

6816
03:13:57,270 --> 03:13:58,103
you know,

6817
03:13:58,250 --> 03:13:59,750
super high level wrestler.

6818
03:14:00,470 --> 03:14:02,390
That kid Gregory Gillespie.

6819
03:14:03,710 --> 03:14:05,600
That kid is legit good,

6820
03:14:06,260 --> 03:14:07,610
really good wrestler,

6821
03:14:07,690 --> 03:14:08,120
you know,

6822
03:14:08,120 --> 03:14:08,660
really good.

6823
03:14:08,660 --> 03:14:10,820
He's a four time all American and he's um,

6824
03:14:11,360 --> 03:14:12,380
national champion.

6825
03:14:13,190 --> 03:14:14,450
This guy before,

6826
03:14:14,540 --> 03:14:15,373
um,

6827
03:14:15,470 --> 03:14:16,161
I met him.

6828
03:14:16,161 --> 03:14:17,150
Everybody else was like,

6829
03:14:17,180 --> 03:14:19,190
I was going up there to
train and everybody's like,

6830
03:14:19,191 --> 03:14:19,431
yeah,

6831
03:14:19,431 --> 03:14:20,660
when you could get what Gregor man,

6832
03:14:20,661 --> 03:14:20,961
he's,

6833
03:14:20,961 --> 03:14:21,920
he's a beast on top.

6834
03:14:22,670 --> 03:14:24,770
I went up there for about three weeks.

6835
03:14:25,070 --> 03:14:25,791
First go,

6836
03:14:25,791 --> 03:14:26,480
we go,

6837
03:14:26,480 --> 03:14:27,530
he takes me down.

6838
03:14:27,630 --> 03:14:27,981
I'm like,

6839
03:14:27,981 --> 03:14:28,281
all right,

6840
03:14:28,281 --> 03:14:28,551
cool.

6841
03:14:28,551 --> 03:14:30,140
This guy's supposed to be a beast on top.

6842
03:14:30,190 --> 03:14:31,880
And I get up,

6843
03:14:33,050 --> 03:14:35,090
I get up on the very first try.

6844
03:14:35,210 --> 03:14:36,020
Right.

6845
03:14:36,020 --> 03:14:38,090
It was the last time I
got up for three weeks.

6846
03:14:40,210 --> 03:14:41,043
I went to Japan

6847
03:14:43,850 --> 03:14:44,990
for three weeks.

6848
03:14:44,991 --> 03:14:45,730
Three weeks.

6849
03:14:45,730 --> 03:14:45,871
I,

6850
03:14:45,871 --> 03:14:46,551
I couldn't,

6851
03:14:46,551 --> 03:14:48,650
I couldn't do anything
when he was on top of me.

6852
03:14:48,770 --> 03:14:49,603
Wow.

6853
03:14:49,640 --> 03:14:50,750
I couldn't do anything.

6854
03:14:51,470 --> 03:14:52,303
Nothing.

6855
03:14:54,110 --> 03:14:55,130
There's dudes like that.

6856
03:14:55,160 --> 03:14:56,600
He's really good.

6857
03:14:57,380 --> 03:14:58,213
Bam.

6858
03:15:00,180 --> 03:15:00,410
Yeah.

6859
03:15:00,410 --> 03:15:02,300
There's like what we're talking about,

6860
03:15:02,301 --> 03:15:06,200
about specialists or people that
just have that higher level.

6861
03:15:06,830 --> 03:15:09,440
Well that's one of the things that
always intrigued me about aspirin.

6862
03:15:09,910 --> 03:15:11,360
I said Pedis would say like,

6863
03:15:11,390 --> 03:15:12,410
I couldn't fight that dude.

6864
03:15:12,740 --> 03:15:13,340
That dude,

6865
03:15:13,340 --> 03:15:14,450
he just holds me down.

6866
03:15:14,480 --> 03:15:15,760
Do whatever the fuck he wants to me.

6867
03:15:17,320 --> 03:15:19,680
I want to see the Ma.

6868
03:15:21,290 --> 03:15:25,160
I want to say Ben used to like,

6869
03:15:25,161 --> 03:15:25,611
he,

6870
03:15:25,611 --> 03:15:29,390
I met him when I first met Tyra and I
went up to Missouri to train and um,

6871
03:15:30,520 --> 03:15:31,110
we were retiring,

6872
03:15:31,110 --> 03:15:34,460
took me some time to some
tournament and Ben was,

6873
03:15:34,670 --> 03:15:36,680
he was just going out and pin and dude,

6874
03:15:36,740 --> 03:15:37,041
I mean,

6875
03:15:37,041 --> 03:15:41,960
he's pinning like college level
wrestlers in the first period.

6876
03:15:41,961 --> 03:15:42,890
Sometimes like,

6877
03:15:42,891 --> 03:15:43,724
quickly,

6878
03:15:43,820 --> 03:15:44,210
um,

6879
03:15:44,210 --> 03:15:47,640
Dean Dean says to me the first
time he met Ben or they'll order,

6880
03:15:47,641 --> 03:15:49,040
the first time he worked out with Ben,

6881
03:15:49,470 --> 03:15:50,010
he's like,

6882
03:15:50,010 --> 03:15:50,311
Ben,

6883
03:15:50,311 --> 03:15:51,190
just asking him goes,

6884
03:15:51,840 --> 03:15:53,160
do you know what a sprawl is?

6885
03:15:53,620 --> 03:15:54,030
Like,

6886
03:15:54,030 --> 03:15:54,751
like he just,

6887
03:15:54,751 --> 03:15:57,390
he couldn't do anything about
what Ben was doing to him.

6888
03:15:57,540 --> 03:15:58,770
So he didn't know.

6889
03:15:58,800 --> 03:16:01,020
Ben Didn't know if he knew how to sprawl.

6890
03:16:01,350 --> 03:16:03,960
Like Dean Thomas doesn't
know how to sprawl.

6891
03:16:05,190 --> 03:16:06,023
Wow.

6892
03:16:06,150 --> 03:16:07,650
That's how good he is though.

6893
03:16:08,120 --> 03:16:08,953
Right.

6894
03:16:09,900 --> 03:16:11,040
And how good he is.

6895
03:16:11,070 --> 03:16:12,960
Did you ever see when he
rolled Marcello Garcia?

6896
03:16:13,010 --> 03:16:13,843
Yup.

6897
03:16:13,930 --> 03:16:15,030
Marsala just tap,

6898
03:16:15,210 --> 03:16:15,481
tap,

6899
03:16:15,481 --> 03:16:15,751
tap,

6900
03:16:15,751 --> 03:16:16,584
tap them.

6901
03:16:16,940 --> 03:16:18,630
Marcel is just so freakish,

6902
03:16:19,100 --> 03:16:20,130
you know his Jujitsu,

6903
03:16:20,131 --> 03:16:21,720
especially in his prime.

6904
03:16:22,470 --> 03:16:23,460
So Freakish.

6905
03:16:24,170 --> 03:16:25,590
Oh I saw that as a beast dude.

6906
03:16:25,980 --> 03:16:26,813
Yeah.

6907
03:16:26,940 --> 03:16:31,940
I was in Brazil when he emerged on the
scene in 2003 when he fought a Shaolin

6908
03:16:32,221 --> 03:16:32,940
and choked him out.

6909
03:16:32,940 --> 03:16:36,930
He got his back and then in the rolling
and spinning he put them to sleep.

6910
03:16:37,230 --> 03:16:37,980
Like as,

6911
03:16:37,980 --> 03:16:40,020
as Shalon was trying to defend,

6912
03:16:40,350 --> 03:16:43,290
he's getting his back and I
believe he got them from the side.

6913
03:16:43,500 --> 03:16:45,120
I think he'd wind up like rear naked,

6914
03:16:45,121 --> 03:16:48,210
choke him from the side and
that's how he put him to sleep.

6915
03:16:48,420 --> 03:16:53,130
But it was just Shaolin refusing to tap
cause nobody even knew who Marcello was

6916
03:16:53,131 --> 03:16:53,964
back then.

6917
03:16:54,600 --> 03:16:56,820
And that was like one
of his most impressive,

6918
03:16:56,821 --> 03:17:01,821
like early on victories like that to
this day is one of my all time favorite

6919
03:17:03,031 --> 03:17:06,180
submission victories that
I've ever seen anybody uh,

6920
03:17:07,170 --> 03:17:12,170
perform because it was just so explosive
and fast and final put them to sleep.

6921
03:17:14,430 --> 03:17:19,170
It's very rarely see a high Lynn high
level guy like Shaolin he barrow get put

6922
03:17:19,171 --> 03:17:20,004
to sleep,

6923
03:17:20,610 --> 03:17:21,390
you know,

6924
03:17:21,390 --> 03:17:24,960
and that was the first time we'd ever
seen Marcello Shaolin was one of those

6925
03:17:24,961 --> 03:17:25,794
guys too.

6926
03:17:25,920 --> 03:17:27,090
Like when he came to MMA,

6927
03:17:27,091 --> 03:17:28,620
he was one of those dangerous guys.

6928
03:17:28,710 --> 03:17:29,490
Oh yeah.

6929
03:17:29,490 --> 03:17:30,920
Super high level grappler.

6930
03:17:30,930 --> 03:17:31,763
Yeah.

6931
03:17:32,070 --> 03:17:32,581
I mean,

6932
03:17:32,581 --> 03:17:32,881
uh,

6933
03:17:32,881 --> 03:17:35,220
and this was the Abu Dhabi 2003.

6934
03:17:35,430 --> 03:17:35,701
Jamie.

6935
03:17:35,701 --> 03:17:39,120
See if you can find that
Marcello Garcia vs Shaolin.

6936
03:17:41,050 --> 03:17:41,461
It's only,

6937
03:17:41,461 --> 03:17:42,810
it's not a fast fight.

6938
03:17:42,960 --> 03:17:43,231
I mean,

6939
03:17:43,231 --> 03:17:44,430
it's not a long fight at all,

6940
03:17:44,910 --> 03:17:45,301
I should say.

6941
03:17:45,301 --> 03:17:46,920
Match fighters get mad.

6942
03:17:48,300 --> 03:17:49,590
Jujitsu guys call it fights.

6943
03:17:49,860 --> 03:17:51,750
Fires like to match Bro.

6944
03:17:53,690 --> 03:17:53,940
Dot.

6945
03:17:53,940 --> 03:17:54,773
A fight.

6946
03:17:56,820 --> 03:17:58,620
But a boxing match is a fight to,

6947
03:17:58,730 --> 03:17:59,371
isn't that a fight?

6948
03:17:59,371 --> 03:17:59,910
Here it is.

6949
03:17:59,910 --> 03:18:01,430
As he takes his back like this,

6950
03:18:01,620 --> 03:18:02,400
you get hit.

6951
03:18:02,400 --> 03:18:03,233
That's a fight.

6952
03:18:03,270 --> 03:18:04,710
This is a match.

6953
03:18:05,190 --> 03:18:06,660
It takes his back and he chokes him here.

6954
03:18:06,661 --> 03:18:07,620
Like sideways.

6955
03:18:08,200 --> 03:18:09,033
Yeah,

6956
03:18:10,110 --> 03:18:11,250
that's he put them asleep.

6957
03:18:13,110 --> 03:18:13,621
This is,

6958
03:18:13,621 --> 03:18:14,454
um,

6959
03:18:14,940 --> 03:18:15,773
boom.

6960
03:18:15,840 --> 03:18:16,770
I was final.

6961
03:18:17,580 --> 03:18:18,413
This was,

6962
03:18:18,960 --> 03:18:20,670
nobody knew who Marcello Garcia was.

6963
03:18:20,671 --> 03:18:22,230
Everybody knew shall Lynn was,

6964
03:18:22,890 --> 03:18:24,300
you know [inaudible] I remember that.

6965
03:18:24,330 --> 03:18:24,451
Uh,

6966
03:18:24,451 --> 03:18:26,240
hearing about his name right after that,

6967
03:18:26,250 --> 03:18:27,150
seeing that video.

6968
03:18:27,420 --> 03:18:28,253
Yeah,

6969
03:18:28,470 --> 03:18:29,210
I remember that.

6970
03:18:29,210 --> 03:18:30,300
Play that shit again Jamie.

6971
03:18:31,230 --> 03:18:32,063
It was crazy.

6972
03:18:33,030 --> 03:18:33,391
Do it like,

6973
03:18:33,391 --> 03:18:33,571
yeah,

6974
03:18:33,571 --> 03:18:34,404
right from there.

6975
03:18:35,230 --> 03:18:35,760
Okay.

6976
03:18:35,760 --> 03:18:35,970
No,

6977
03:18:35,970 --> 03:18:40,330
the thing about Marcella was that arm
drag to the back was just so unstoppable,

6978
03:18:40,690 --> 03:18:42,130
so unstoppable.

6979
03:18:42,490 --> 03:18:43,810
He would get to that position,

6980
03:18:43,811 --> 03:18:44,081
man.

6981
03:18:44,081 --> 03:18:45,250
It was just so tight.

6982
03:18:46,750 --> 03:18:47,560
Look at he's,

6983
03:18:47,560 --> 03:18:48,580
he's essentially

6984
03:18:48,610 --> 03:18:52,900
one hook and he's like on top on the side.

6985
03:18:53,630 --> 03:18:55,660
These get them spun
around and flattened out.

6986
03:18:56,310 --> 03:18:57,280
Cheat back.

6987
03:18:57,400 --> 03:18:58,233
Yeah.

6988
03:18:58,270 --> 03:19:03,250
He was chest to back and he act like
he stopped him from rolling out of it

6989
03:19:03,251 --> 03:19:04,084
perfectly.

6990
03:19:04,150 --> 03:19:05,140
It was just death,

6991
03:19:05,980 --> 03:19:09,430
like the way spinning
and trying to resolve.

6992
03:19:09,431 --> 03:19:11,140
Never at least have that chest the back.

6993
03:19:11,141 --> 03:19:11,501
No,

6994
03:19:11,501 --> 03:19:11,980
never.

6995
03:19:11,980 --> 03:19:13,570
He's squeeze something else,

6996
03:19:13,571 --> 03:19:14,080
man.

6997
03:19:14,080 --> 03:19:14,913
Oof.

6998
03:19:15,010 --> 03:19:17,710
That is one of my all time
favorite submission victories,

6999
03:19:18,010 --> 03:19:19,030
but just because of the,

7000
03:19:19,080 --> 03:19:20,830
the finale to it,

7001
03:19:20,831 --> 03:19:21,730
but also the,

7002
03:19:22,270 --> 03:19:24,550
the fucking ruthlessness of his technique.

7003
03:19:24,970 --> 03:19:26,680
He had both things going on.

7004
03:19:26,681 --> 03:19:27,101
It was like,

7005
03:19:27,101 --> 03:19:29,710
he had an incredible
technique and aggression

7006
03:19:31,390 --> 03:19:32,680
and perfect,

7007
03:19:32,770 --> 03:19:34,870
perfect timing and perfect positioning.

7008
03:19:35,950 --> 03:19:36,783
Fuck,

7009
03:19:37,120 --> 03:19:37,953
that's amazing.

7010
03:19:38,020 --> 03:19:38,650
And again,

7011
03:19:38,650 --> 03:19:39,483
Shaolin,

7012
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:40,630
he did it to a beast,

7013
03:19:41,010 --> 03:19:41,261
you know,

7014
03:19:41,261 --> 03:19:43,120
it wasn't like to some regular person,

7015
03:19:43,780 --> 03:19:44,141
he was,

7016
03:19:44,141 --> 03:19:44,380
um,

7017
03:19:44,380 --> 03:19:49,380
he was at American top team for awhile
and it sucks because like all my training

7018
03:19:49,691 --> 03:19:50,650
partners beat me up.

7019
03:19:52,450 --> 03:19:56,710
I'm training with myself
that he's training for an
MMA fight over in Japan and

7020
03:19:56,711 --> 03:20:01,180
I'm training for a fight and we're
going and I'm keeping it standing.

7021
03:20:01,181 --> 03:20:02,300
I'm defending takedowns,

7022
03:20:02,320 --> 03:20:06,730
I'm winning the round and Conan
goes 30 seconds and I'm like,

7023
03:20:07,030 --> 03:20:07,870
30 seconds.

7024
03:20:07,871 --> 03:20:08,201
Yeah,

7025
03:20:08,201 --> 03:20:09,520
I've dominated this round.

7026
03:20:09,521 --> 03:20:09,911
Okay,

7027
03:20:09,911 --> 03:20:11,200
now let me be strategic.

7028
03:20:11,201 --> 03:20:12,130
I'm gonna take him down,

7029
03:20:12,250 --> 03:20:14,310
secure the round and you know,

7030
03:20:14,320 --> 03:20:15,190
kind of put it out there.

7031
03:20:15,191 --> 03:20:17,950
This is the judges that I'm
not afraid of his ground game,

7032
03:20:18,110 --> 03:20:18,410
you know,

7033
03:20:18,410 --> 03:20:20,260
just kind of playing the game in my head.

7034
03:20:20,890 --> 03:20:25,890
I shoot a shot and on the way down he
reverses me and he taps me before the

7035
03:20:25,931 --> 03:20:26,764
round is over,

7036
03:20:27,280 --> 03:20:28,113
like

7037
03:20:31,080 --> 03:20:31,913
was like,

7038
03:20:32,440 --> 03:20:33,910
this is garbage.

7039
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:34,900
This is bullshit.

7040
03:20:37,100 --> 03:20:37,810
He,

7041
03:20:37,810 --> 03:20:39,580
he's ridiculously good.

7042
03:20:40,060 --> 03:20:41,350
Is he the best guy you ever roll with?

7043
03:20:41,380 --> 03:20:42,213
Absolutely.

7044
03:20:42,220 --> 03:20:43,150
By far.

7045
03:20:44,620 --> 03:20:45,453
I mean,

7046
03:20:45,490 --> 03:20:46,840
Matt Lindland was like,

7047
03:20:46,950 --> 03:20:47,290
like,

7048
03:20:47,290 --> 03:20:49,240
I can't do anything that
I got just a gorilla.

7049
03:20:49,390 --> 03:20:50,500
He's so,

7050
03:20:50,501 --> 03:20:51,370
he's so good.

7051
03:20:52,360 --> 03:20:53,410
He's really good,

7052
03:20:56,200 --> 03:20:57,033
man.

7053
03:20:57,700 --> 03:20:58,533
That's interesting.

7054
03:20:59,000 --> 03:20:59,980
That's really good.

7055
03:21:00,070 --> 03:21:00,903
Like,

7056
03:21:01,300 --> 03:21:05,860
like I would love to see him and Omega
Madoff not necessarily in a fight,

7057
03:21:05,890 --> 03:21:07,150
just in a wrestling,

7058
03:21:07,151 --> 03:21:08,180
grappling situation.

7059
03:21:08,181 --> 03:21:09,250
Sambo situation.

7060
03:21:09,251 --> 03:21:10,600
I would just love to see that.

7061
03:21:10,690 --> 03:21:11,523
I don't know.

7062
03:21:11,710 --> 03:21:13,390
I've never trained with Tomago meadow of,

7063
03:21:14,110 --> 03:21:15,400
I don't know how good he is.

7064
03:21:15,550 --> 03:21:17,710
I'm sure he's great because of what he,

7065
03:21:17,711 --> 03:21:18,550
I seen him do,

7066
03:21:19,030 --> 03:21:20,530
but I would just love to see that.

7067
03:21:20,531 --> 03:21:24,400
I know his wrestling is probably
the best in the UFC right now,

7068
03:21:24,430 --> 03:21:26,450
so I'm a guy like that,

7069
03:21:26,480 --> 03:21:30,310
but I know some really good wrestlers
that get destroyed by Marcello.

7070
03:21:30,470 --> 03:21:31,090
Yeah.

7071
03:21:31,090 --> 03:21:33,940
Like Ben ask him like we were talking
about in that video was actually rolling.

7072
03:21:35,260 --> 03:21:35,890
Yeah.

7073
03:21:35,890 --> 03:21:38,680
Well Marcello's got that fucking insane.

7074
03:21:38,681 --> 03:21:39,610
Squeeze man,

7075
03:21:40,180 --> 03:21:41,530
the guillotine squeeze.

7076
03:21:41,740 --> 03:21:43,930
He's got a nasty north south squeeze.

7077
03:21:44,470 --> 03:21:46,040
He's got his back

7078
03:21:46,040 --> 03:21:47,630
takings legendary.

7079
03:21:47,650 --> 03:21:49,280
His is so good at that arm drag.

7080
03:21:50,330 --> 03:21:51,560
That arm drag is just,

7081
03:21:52,130 --> 03:21:54,050
and before he was pulling it off,

7082
03:21:54,051 --> 03:21:57,410
like the way he was doing it was really
rare to see somebody that specialized on

7083
03:21:57,411 --> 03:22:01,100
it like that or they just specialize
on hey that arm drag and getting to the

7084
03:22:01,101 --> 03:22:01,341
back,

7085
03:22:01,341 --> 03:22:02,450
hidden that arm drag to get to the back,

7086
03:22:02,770 --> 03:22:03,310
you know?

7087
03:22:03,310 --> 03:22:04,910
And then he's doing it
from butterfly guard.

7088
03:22:04,911 --> 03:22:05,570
He was a,

7089
03:22:05,570 --> 03:22:06,830
it wasn't doing it like a wrestler.

7090
03:22:07,640 --> 03:22:08,720
Really interesting guy

7091
03:22:10,360 --> 03:22:12,710
and a big ass giant fucking legs.

7092
03:22:13,220 --> 03:22:13,770
Right.

7093
03:22:13,770 --> 03:22:18,770
You're not big arms like his arms are
kind of normal sized big ass giant legs

7094
03:22:20,030 --> 03:22:20,950
like fat boy.

7095
03:22:20,980 --> 03:22:24,030
I mean they muscle jump
over just like round dude.

7096
03:22:24,031 --> 03:22:24,864
They're huge.

7097
03:22:25,160 --> 03:22:26,090
He's all legs.

7098
03:22:26,480 --> 03:22:30,220
It's really interesting like that.

7099
03:22:30,260 --> 03:22:33,110
That is one thing that I think
is like super underrated.

7100
03:22:33,470 --> 03:22:35,720
It kind of in all of any,

7101
03:22:35,721 --> 03:22:36,950
any sort of combat sports,

7102
03:22:37,370 --> 03:22:40,370
the size of your legs is so gigantic.

7103
03:22:40,371 --> 03:22:42,020
Like the power in your legs rather.

7104
03:22:42,200 --> 03:22:45,200
The ability that your legs have
like look at Pac cow's legs,

7105
03:22:46,440 --> 03:22:50,450
that dude as these giant ass
golf ball or a tennis ball,

7106
03:22:50,451 --> 03:22:52,910
calves that fucker.

7107
03:22:52,970 --> 03:22:53,091
Yeah,

7108
03:22:53,091 --> 03:22:54,470
you were looking at mellow pets.

7109
03:22:54,480 --> 03:22:55,313
Calves.

7110
03:22:55,900 --> 03:22:57,080
He can't like can't,

7111
03:22:57,250 --> 03:22:58,830
he can't wear like normal pay.

7112
03:22:58,890 --> 03:23:01,430
You can't pull it up over his cat socks.

7113
03:23:01,810 --> 03:23:03,080
Just ridiculous.

7114
03:23:03,680 --> 03:23:04,160
Yeah.

7115
03:23:04,160 --> 03:23:04,860
Sanchez.

7116
03:23:04,860 --> 03:23:05,693
Same thing.

7117
03:23:05,780 --> 03:23:06,980
Giant ass calves.

7118
03:23:11,430 --> 03:23:13,360
Like can you go back
and think about Tyson?

7119
03:23:13,780 --> 03:23:17,260
One of the things about Tyson that
was so fucking impressive is his legs.

7120
03:23:17,590 --> 03:23:22,590
He would leap at you and throw bombs at
the same time and they're just coming up

7121
03:23:22,661 --> 03:23:23,710
from the ground.

7122
03:23:25,150 --> 03:23:29,950
I mean there's so much horsepower behind
that and a lot of that was coming up

7123
03:23:29,951 --> 03:23:31,870
through those giant ass fucking legs.

7124
03:23:35,020 --> 03:23:35,320
Really.

7125
03:23:35,320 --> 03:23:35,661
You know,

7126
03:23:35,661 --> 03:23:38,190
really interesting when you
think about it from Marcel,

7127
03:23:38,191 --> 03:23:39,110
does the query,

7128
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:41,510
which guide guide the audience

7129
03:23:43,510 --> 03:23:44,810
would think about it with Marcella,

7130
03:23:44,811 --> 03:23:47,330
what's interesting is he's
securing you with those legs.

7131
03:23:47,840 --> 03:23:49,370
Like when he's taking backs.

7132
03:23:49,371 --> 03:23:50,450
Like that's his big thing,

7133
03:23:50,451 --> 03:23:50,721
right?

7134
03:23:50,721 --> 03:23:52,070
And then get teens as well.

7135
03:23:52,340 --> 03:23:53,450
He's using those,

7136
03:23:53,451 --> 03:23:58,451
that incredible leg power to secure you
to secure you and to get you controlled

7137
03:24:00,111 --> 03:24:00,921
by those lay.

7138
03:24:00,921 --> 03:24:01,460
Yeah.

7139
03:24:01,460 --> 03:24:03,520
Like you see the way control
Shaolin on the ground,

7140
03:24:03,540 --> 03:24:04,373
the end of it.

7141
03:24:04,430 --> 03:24:06,020
He's a smushing everything.

7142
03:24:06,440 --> 03:24:09,500
It's all that power that allows
him to get the chokes off better.

7143
03:24:10,190 --> 03:24:10,581
I think.

7144
03:24:10,581 --> 03:24:11,391
I feel like it's,

7145
03:24:11,391 --> 03:24:13,010
it's one of those things where he's,

7146
03:24:13,011 --> 03:24:18,011
he's figured out just how to use exactly
the right amount of muscle in the right

7147
03:24:18,621 --> 03:24:21,350
direction to control you with his leg.

7148
03:24:21,420 --> 03:24:22,570
Like using his legs.

7149
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:24,090
His a hand grab.

7150
03:24:24,280 --> 03:24:25,113
Yeah.

7151
03:24:25,740 --> 03:24:27,800
But like same thing
with like a specialist,

7152
03:24:27,801 --> 03:24:28,710
like no Madoff.

7153
03:24:28,730 --> 03:24:30,500
Same thing with a
specialist like Damien Maia.

7154
03:24:30,501 --> 03:24:35,501
I feel like they have that ability to
change the little details and use them,

7155
03:24:36,170 --> 03:24:40,400
use their body the perfect way
to make that specific thing work.

7156
03:24:40,850 --> 03:24:41,061
Yeah.

7157
03:24:41,061 --> 03:24:44,370
You know the other thing that's
interesting about Marcel is he doesn't,

7158
03:24:44,910 --> 03:24:49,380
he doesn't utilize any strong person
moves like you won't do Camorra's.

7159
03:24:49,770 --> 03:24:51,900
He thinks Camorra's are
a strong person move.

7160
03:24:52,590 --> 03:24:55,320
He things like grabbing the
Garmin Yankton behind him.

7161
03:24:55,350 --> 03:24:58,170
He doesn't do those or at least
he didn't for a long time.

7162
03:24:58,171 --> 03:24:59,100
And that was his rationale.

7163
03:24:59,320 --> 03:25:01,710
He might've changed and went to it now,

7164
03:25:01,860 --> 03:25:04,050
but I know for the longest time
it wasn't interested in those.

7165
03:25:04,200 --> 03:25:06,440
He was just interested in
putting motherfuckers to sleep.

7166
03:25:07,100 --> 03:25:08,910
Like he's like,

7167
03:25:08,940 --> 03:25:09,480
hmm.

7168
03:25:09,480 --> 03:25:10,291
Like all the,

7169
03:25:10,291 --> 03:25:12,150
all you have to do is
get ahold of that neck.

7170
03:25:12,150 --> 03:25:14,790
And if I become a specialist
in squeezing next,

7171
03:25:14,940 --> 03:25:16,140
I'm just gonna put everybody to sleep.

7172
03:25:16,141 --> 03:25:18,270
I don't need to be messing
up your shoulder or anything.

7173
03:25:18,690 --> 03:25:19,800
I'll just shut you off.

7174
03:25:20,130 --> 03:25:20,341
I mean,

7175
03:25:20,341 --> 03:25:21,750
it's the most def def,

7176
03:25:21,960 --> 03:25:24,570
like a guy can tap you
and it's very definitive.

7177
03:25:24,571 --> 03:25:25,110
Right?

7178
03:25:25,110 --> 03:25:26,690
The guy gets you in an arm bar and Tab.

7179
03:25:26,820 --> 03:25:27,653
It's very definitive,

7180
03:25:27,900 --> 03:25:30,810
but there's something about the way
climbs off shall Shaolin and challenge his

7181
03:25:30,811 --> 03:25:34,650
unconscious and he just
scrolls him out in seconds.

7182
03:25:35,040 --> 03:25:36,960
It's the most definitive ending next to,

7183
03:25:37,380 --> 03:25:38,940
I mean obviously next to a knockout,

7184
03:25:39,510 --> 03:25:40,830
knockout being the most definitive.

7185
03:25:40,831 --> 03:25:41,011
Right.

7186
03:25:41,011 --> 03:25:42,990
Because it carries the most consequences.

7187
03:25:43,230 --> 03:25:44,063
Yeah.

7188
03:25:44,130 --> 03:25:44,551
But I mean,

7189
03:25:44,551 --> 03:25:45,210
they both,

7190
03:25:45,210 --> 03:25:46,520
they both put you to sleep,

7191
03:25:46,530 --> 03:25:47,430
devote real life.

7192
03:25:47,870 --> 03:25:48,660
Like you're dead.

7193
03:25:48,660 --> 03:25:49,493
You're dead,

7194
03:25:49,590 --> 03:25:50,423
you're dead.

7195
03:25:50,910 --> 03:25:51,743
That's no,

7196
03:25:51,900 --> 03:25:53,250
that's legitimate.

7197
03:25:53,251 --> 03:25:54,240
Like that would kill you.

7198
03:25:54,420 --> 03:25:55,240
Yeah.

7199
03:25:55,240 --> 03:25:55,960
Yeah.

7200
03:25:55,960 --> 03:25:57,100
Oh Oh,

7201
03:25:57,390 --> 03:26:00,970
Marcel would have to do is keep
hanging on for another 30 seconds.

7202
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:01,980
Second dead guy over.

7203
03:26:01,981 --> 03:26:02,641
No referee.

7204
03:26:02,641 --> 03:26:03,390
It's over.

7205
03:26:03,390 --> 03:26:03,720
Yeah.

7206
03:26:03,720 --> 03:26:03,991
I mean,

7207
03:26:03,991 --> 03:26:04,621
he just climbed.

7208
03:26:04,621 --> 03:26:08,560
And the crazy thing is he just did
that to a worldclass blackbelt yeah,

7209
03:26:10,140 --> 03:26:10,973
yeah,

7210
03:26:10,980 --> 03:26:11,251
yeah.

7211
03:26:11,251 --> 03:26:11,671
It's this,

7212
03:26:11,671 --> 03:26:11,881
again,

7213
03:26:11,881 --> 03:26:12,714
anything,

7214
03:26:12,900 --> 03:26:13,320
those,

7215
03:26:13,320 --> 03:26:15,460
those people that,

7216
03:26:15,461 --> 03:26:17,090
that work for Hillary Clinton,

7217
03:26:17,120 --> 03:26:19,440
they put the inject you
to put you to sleep,

7218
03:26:20,780 --> 03:26:22,430
but when you're out you can go,

7219
03:26:22,470 --> 03:26:23,700
they can take you somewhere.

7220
03:26:23,701 --> 03:26:24,870
So when you get knocked out,

7221
03:26:24,871 --> 03:26:26,190
when you get choked unconscious,

7222
03:26:26,191 --> 03:26:26,671
it's like,

7223
03:26:26,671 --> 03:26:26,881
yeah,

7224
03:26:26,881 --> 03:26:27,630
you're dead.

7225
03:26:27,630 --> 03:26:27,841
You,

7226
03:26:27,841 --> 03:26:28,980
you are at their mercy.

7227
03:26:28,981 --> 03:26:32,430
Absolutely nothing you can do about
whatever they wanted to do to you.

7228
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:37,110
Why do you gotta bring in Hillary
Clinton and interject and people

7229
03:26:39,320 --> 03:26:40,153
talking about

7230
03:26:42,080 --> 03:26:42,913
politics,

7231
03:26:43,410 --> 03:26:44,640
about the Trump thing.

7232
03:26:44,670 --> 03:26:45,390
And I just want,

7233
03:26:45,390 --> 03:26:47,760
I just wanted to put it out there
that I'm against them both though.

7234
03:26:47,761 --> 03:26:49,440
So I don't want anybody coming after me.

7235
03:26:49,441 --> 03:26:50,330
I had to say first.

7236
03:26:50,350 --> 03:26:51,090
Yeah.

7237
03:26:51,090 --> 03:26:51,660
Joe Schilling.

7238
03:26:51,660 --> 03:26:52,180
What do you think?

7239
03:26:52,180 --> 03:26:53,310
You know these guys very well.

7240
03:26:53,311 --> 03:26:54,040
Dustin Jacola.

7241
03:26:54,040 --> 03:26:54,900
Simon Marcus.

7242
03:26:54,990 --> 03:26:56,250
Big Step up for Jacoby though,

7243
03:26:56,251 --> 03:26:56,990
right?

7244
03:26:56,990 --> 03:26:57,540
Yeah.

7245
03:26:57,540 --> 03:26:59,190
I think it's the biggest step up for him.

7246
03:26:59,490 --> 03:27:00,960
I think they already fought once.

7247
03:27:00,961 --> 03:27:01,794
No.

7248
03:27:02,370 --> 03:27:03,320
Did he rematch?

7249
03:27:04,460 --> 03:27:06,580
Like here we go and that way.

7250
03:27:06,590 --> 03:27:07,423
Yeah.

7251
03:27:07,500 --> 03:27:07,840
But uh,

7252
03:27:07,840 --> 03:27:08,220
yeah,

7253
03:27:08,220 --> 03:27:09,001
Dustin's not,

7254
03:27:09,001 --> 03:27:11,320
I don't think Dustin's
who won the first fight.

7255
03:27:11,790 --> 03:27:12,330
I didn't even want,

7256
03:27:12,330 --> 03:27:15,690
I mean once the first
did Simon when 71 yet.

7257
03:27:16,200 --> 03:27:17,033
Do you know how he won?

7258
03:27:18,030 --> 03:27:18,863
I don't.

7259
03:27:20,160 --> 03:27:25,160
There was the Brazilian guy who k
owed Jacola Jacoby with a left hook.

7260
03:27:25,700 --> 03:27:26,850
I remember that Jacoby.

7261
03:27:26,851 --> 03:27:27,420
It was like,

7262
03:27:27,420 --> 03:27:28,110
oh.

7263
03:27:28,110 --> 03:27:33,110
And first he fought it two oh five with
glory and lost like five or six fights.

7264
03:27:33,850 --> 03:27:35,580
He was fighting a long time.

7265
03:27:35,581 --> 03:27:35,850
Right?

7266
03:27:35,850 --> 03:27:36,683
Yeah.

7267
03:27:37,160 --> 03:27:40,360
I mean went to one at 85 and uh,

7268
03:27:41,100 --> 03:27:42,010
knock out two

7269
03:27:42,010 --> 03:27:42,843
months.

7270
03:27:43,030 --> 03:27:43,181
Oh,

7271
03:27:43,181 --> 03:27:43,480
nice.

7272
03:27:43,480 --> 03:27:44,313
Push Turkey.

7273
03:27:47,020 --> 03:27:51,640
He's definitely got a lot better as a
striker since he's been concentrating

7274
03:27:51,641 --> 03:27:52,540
entirely on it.

7275
03:27:53,050 --> 03:27:53,190
Oh.

7276
03:27:53,190 --> 03:27:54,140
So there it is a,

7277
03:27:54,170 --> 03:27:56,440
there's a decision Simon
Marcus wanted decision.

7278
03:27:57,760 --> 03:27:58,900
That was the first fight they had.

7279
03:27:59,140 --> 03:27:59,321
Yeah.

7280
03:27:59,321 --> 03:27:59,810
I would say if,

7281
03:27:59,810 --> 03:28:01,270
if Jacoby has a,

7282
03:28:01,271 --> 03:28:06,271
has a best chance of winning this fight
now than there because of the high

7283
03:28:06,551 --> 03:28:07,384
altitude.

7284
03:28:07,930 --> 03:28:08,331
Uh,

7285
03:28:08,331 --> 03:28:09,970
and he's a a Colorado guy.

7286
03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:10,211
Yeah.

7287
03:28:10,211 --> 03:28:11,140
He lives in Colorado.

7288
03:28:11,800 --> 03:28:12,800
And then do you,

7289
03:28:12,940 --> 03:28:16,750
how much of a fact do you think Simon
Mark is just losing by Kao to Jason?

7290
03:28:16,751 --> 03:28:17,320
Wilderness?

7291
03:28:17,320 --> 03:28:20,150
Is was not that long ago.

7292
03:28:20,560 --> 03:28:21,211
I don't think so.

7293
03:28:21,211 --> 03:28:22,210
It was like two months ago.

7294
03:28:23,540 --> 03:28:24,540
Right.

7295
03:28:24,640 --> 03:28:25,450
Um,

7296
03:28:25,450 --> 03:28:28,420
it couldn't have been more
than three you don't think.

7297
03:28:28,850 --> 03:28:29,890
And he was out out.

7298
03:28:30,490 --> 03:28:31,600
He got beat up.

7299
03:28:31,720 --> 03:28:32,560
They stopped it,

7300
03:28:32,590 --> 03:28:33,710
but he got beat up.

7301
03:28:33,870 --> 03:28:34,720
He was fucked up.

7302
03:28:35,170 --> 03:28:37,650
He got hurt and he got dropped once.

7303
03:28:38,050 --> 03:28:40,330
He got dropped more than
once that six weeks ago.

7304
03:28:40,370 --> 03:28:41,203
Wow.

7305
03:28:41,470 --> 03:28:43,760
And that was six weeks out to the socks.

7306
03:28:45,590 --> 03:28:47,320
He's flinching a lot of factors.

7307
03:28:47,330 --> 03:28:47,560
Yeah.

7308
03:28:47,560 --> 03:28:49,450
He doesn't look a calm,

7309
03:28:49,460 --> 03:28:50,293
comfortable.

7310
03:28:51,040 --> 03:28:52,180
And Dustin is a big,

7311
03:28:52,390 --> 03:28:53,223
big guy.

7312
03:28:54,430 --> 03:28:55,960
I feel like he's going to get knocked out.

7313
03:28:56,080 --> 03:28:56,531
I'll tell you what,

7314
03:28:56,531 --> 03:28:58,780
in the first round in
the wilderness fight,

7315
03:28:58,781 --> 03:29:00,400
he looked like a fucking world beater.

7316
03:29:00,460 --> 03:29:01,300
He really did.

7317
03:29:01,900 --> 03:29:02,381
And Oh,

7318
03:29:02,381 --> 03:29:03,214
we just got tagged.

7319
03:29:03,550 --> 03:29:04,930
But he looked like a world beater.

7320
03:29:04,931 --> 03:29:06,700
When you fly you in the first round too.

7321
03:29:06,970 --> 03:29:07,331
I mean,

7322
03:29:07,331 --> 03:29:08,560
he's got a fur,

7323
03:29:08,620 --> 03:29:11,260
he's got a first gear that's
pretty fucking sensational.

7324
03:29:11,500 --> 03:29:11,651
I mean,

7325
03:29:11,651 --> 03:29:12,061
he's a,

7326
03:29:12,061 --> 03:29:12,894
he's a,

7327
03:29:13,370 --> 03:29:14,940
he's a traditional Muy Thai guy.

7328
03:29:14,941 --> 03:29:16,120
Some with all of his fights.

7329
03:29:16,121 --> 03:29:19,780
He's got 49 fights there were all Muy
Thai and like where he beat me the first

7330
03:29:19,781 --> 03:29:24,640
two times as he's like incredibly strong
and good in the clinch and we'll like

7331
03:29:24,670 --> 03:29:29,670
zap you and hold you and right
hand clench or he just tagged on.

7332
03:29:30,730 --> 03:29:31,530
So um,

7333
03:29:31,530 --> 03:29:31,870
the,

7334
03:29:31,870 --> 03:29:35,200
the clinch is really the fact that it's
removed from Gloria really hurts him.

7335
03:29:35,650 --> 03:29:36,220
Yeah.

7336
03:29:36,220 --> 03:29:36,970
And his,

7337
03:29:36,970 --> 03:29:38,590
well it forces him to have to fight.

7338
03:29:40,770 --> 03:29:41,860
That's really interesting.

7339
03:29:41,980 --> 03:29:43,030
He used to uh,

7340
03:29:45,130 --> 03:29:47,500
it's cardio look better because
he had more time to clench.

7341
03:29:47,530 --> 03:29:48,700
Now when it's full,

7342
03:29:48,701 --> 03:29:50,710
go and throw him where a combinations,

7343
03:29:50,860 --> 03:29:53,830
well that's interesting too because
he has to completely change his style.

7344
03:29:53,860 --> 03:29:57,700
Like is his cardio is sort of based
on the style of being able to hold on

7345
03:29:57,701 --> 03:29:59,820
whenever you want to like that.

7346
03:30:00,190 --> 03:30:03,340
That's why he was able to get away
with those explosive movements and not,

7347
03:30:03,520 --> 03:30:04,930
not conserve energy.

7348
03:30:05,080 --> 03:30:05,913
Right.

7349
03:30:06,220 --> 03:30:09,460
Cause he could explode like that and
they could clench up when he needed that

7350
03:30:09,461 --> 03:30:11,290
time to clench up and he's very strong.

7351
03:30:12,490 --> 03:30:13,323
Right.

7352
03:30:13,540 --> 03:30:14,410
That's interesting.

7353
03:30:16,150 --> 03:30:18,500
What did you prefer this
or do you prefer more Thai?

7354
03:30:18,720 --> 03:30:21,460
I for the glory rose really for myself.

7355
03:30:21,790 --> 03:30:23,440
If you got to make the
ultimate roles though,

7356
03:30:23,441 --> 03:30:24,041
what would you,

7357
03:30:24,041 --> 03:30:26,740
what would you sell a Duke
Gloria rules with elbows.

7358
03:30:26,830 --> 03:30:27,191
Ah,

7359
03:30:27,191 --> 03:30:27,420
they,

7360
03:30:27,420 --> 03:30:28,330
I like the way of thinking,

7361
03:30:28,720 --> 03:30:29,710
but what about the clinch?

7362
03:30:30,160 --> 03:30:30,831
I think in the clinch,

7363
03:30:30,831 --> 03:30:32,310
just like a use,

7364
03:30:34,470 --> 03:30:35,620
the way you see it,

7365
03:30:36,160 --> 03:30:38,980
the way that you liked the clench
as the way that it is here.

7366
03:30:39,110 --> 03:30:39,980
Just don't realize it,

7367
03:30:39,980 --> 03:30:40,510
but if you want,

7368
03:30:40,510 --> 03:30:41,700
if I showed you one aside,

7369
03:30:41,740 --> 03:30:43,100
what if I showed you Simon and I,

7370
03:30:43,101 --> 03:30:48,101
his second fight where he held onto me
for two minutes out of every round up

7371
03:30:48,171 --> 03:30:51,080
against the ropes and nothing
was happening and I was
just sitting there getting

7372
03:30:51,081 --> 03:30:54,170
squeezed and I'm talking
to Steve Mazzagatti like,

7373
03:30:54,171 --> 03:30:54,321
hey,

7374
03:30:54,321 --> 03:30:55,400
nothing's happening here.

7375
03:30:55,790 --> 03:30:56,181
You wouldn't,

7376
03:30:56,181 --> 03:30:57,140
you wouldn't like it that much.

7377
03:30:57,400 --> 03:30:58,310
I might have broke his arm,

7378
03:30:58,311 --> 03:30:59,144
man.

7379
03:31:00,510 --> 03:31:01,343
Okay,

7380
03:31:01,400 --> 03:31:02,420
they're going to stop the fight.

7381
03:31:03,330 --> 03:31:05,720
It looks like he broke his arm like Kik.

7382
03:31:06,200 --> 03:31:07,033
Yup.

7383
03:31:07,040 --> 03:31:07,311
Yeah.

7384
03:31:07,311 --> 03:31:10,070
They just squoze his arm and he's a pain.

7385
03:31:11,780 --> 03:31:14,030
Now he's getting off
the stool is left arm.

7386
03:31:14,031 --> 03:31:15,080
It's fucked up,

7387
03:31:15,081 --> 03:31:15,770
man.

7388
03:31:15,770 --> 03:31:17,030
What does Simon Marcus,

7389
03:31:17,390 --> 03:31:18,410
what is going on here?

7390
03:31:18,580 --> 03:31:19,413
It's not there.

7391
03:31:19,490 --> 03:31:21,620
The doctor's going to come over
and look at this fights over.

7392
03:31:21,740 --> 03:31:23,930
He's got a broken arm where he keeps like,

7393
03:31:23,931 --> 03:31:25,490
you can't like the fight is over.

7394
03:31:25,730 --> 03:31:26,450
Right?

7395
03:31:26,450 --> 03:31:27,051
What are they gonna do?

7396
03:31:27,051 --> 03:31:27,471
They're gonna say,

7397
03:31:27,471 --> 03:31:28,010
okay,

7398
03:31:28,010 --> 03:31:28,310
go,

7399
03:31:28,310 --> 03:31:29,143
go in there.

7400
03:31:29,810 --> 03:31:31,310
What do they do when they're stuck in Joe?

7401
03:31:31,430 --> 03:31:31,881
Well he's,

7402
03:31:31,881 --> 03:31:32,151
he's,

7403
03:31:32,151 --> 03:31:32,871
he's in pain.

7404
03:31:32,871 --> 03:31:33,390
Right?

7405
03:31:33,390 --> 03:31:34,820
So here's the thing.

7406
03:31:35,000 --> 03:31:35,241
No,

7407
03:31:35,241 --> 03:31:35,420
no.

7408
03:31:35,420 --> 03:31:36,253
So what I'm saying,

7409
03:31:36,320 --> 03:31:38,210
why wouldn't they just have
already started the round?

7410
03:31:38,540 --> 03:31:40,190
Like Simon had done some damage.

7411
03:31:40,191 --> 03:31:40,670
Right?

7412
03:31:40,670 --> 03:31:44,150
Would the idea be that either you are
capable of starting at the beginning of

7413
03:31:44,151 --> 03:31:45,440
the round or the fights over?

7414
03:31:48,140 --> 03:31:48,973
No,

7415
03:31:49,850 --> 03:31:50,683
it's broken.

7416
03:31:54,010 --> 03:31:54,920
They're still deciding.

7417
03:31:57,190 --> 03:31:57,341
Yeah.

7418
03:31:57,341 --> 03:31:58,400
He's saying we've got to stop the fight.

7419
03:31:58,401 --> 03:31:59,051
It must be broken.

7420
03:31:59,051 --> 03:31:59,501
He could feel it.

7421
03:31:59,501 --> 03:32:00,130
It's broken.

7422
03:32:00,130 --> 03:32:05,130
But my question is how do you start
the round and then have the guy have,

7423
03:32:06,160 --> 03:32:07,690
have them get checked out like that.

7424
03:32:07,840 --> 03:32:09,250
Like what if he can,

7425
03:32:09,340 --> 03:32:10,750
if he can't go on,

7426
03:32:10,900 --> 03:32:11,231
I'll give you,

7427
03:32:11,231 --> 03:32:11,861
can't continue.

7428
03:32:11,861 --> 03:32:12,491
You can't continue.

7429
03:32:12,491 --> 03:32:17,410
It seems like if he decided like
I can go on two minutes later,

7430
03:32:17,860 --> 03:32:19,720
it's not really a foul that was committed.

7431
03:32:19,721 --> 03:32:22,720
It's not like he kicked him in the balls
like in the Henderson Bisping fight.

7432
03:32:22,930 --> 03:32:23,171
Right.

7433
03:32:23,171 --> 03:32:24,010
There was a big deal.

7434
03:32:24,310 --> 03:32:25,870
Bisbing kicked Henderson the balls.

7435
03:32:25,871 --> 03:32:27,520
Henderson took a gang of time.

7436
03:32:27,521 --> 03:32:27,791
He was like,

7437
03:32:27,791 --> 03:32:28,031
good,

7438
03:32:28,031 --> 03:32:28,870
I'm gonna take a break.

7439
03:32:29,290 --> 03:32:31,840
And it was a smart move to do that,

7440
03:32:31,841 --> 03:32:32,680
but that made sense.

7441
03:32:32,681 --> 03:32:33,401
He deserved that.

7442
03:32:33,401 --> 03:32:34,270
He got kicked in the balls.

7443
03:32:35,650 --> 03:32:36,131
He didn't,

7444
03:32:36,131 --> 03:32:37,300
Simon didn't do anything wrong.

7445
03:32:37,480 --> 03:32:40,840
He landed kicks and he heard the
dude's arm and then they're like,

7446
03:32:40,841 --> 03:32:40,961
well,

7447
03:32:40,961 --> 03:32:42,160
how bad is he hurt?

7448
03:32:42,161 --> 03:32:43,180
Can we Kenny go on?

7449
03:32:43,300 --> 03:32:43,421
Well,

7450
03:32:43,421 --> 03:32:45,430
if he can't go on at the
beginning of the round,

7451
03:32:46,240 --> 03:32:46,770
then you,

7452
03:32:46,770 --> 03:32:47,530
you shouldn't dis,

7453
03:32:47,530 --> 03:32:48,460
the fight should be stopped.

7454
03:32:48,461 --> 03:32:48,691
Right,

7455
03:32:48,691 --> 03:32:49,180
right.

7456
03:32:49,180 --> 03:32:49,421
Yeah.

7457
03:32:49,421 --> 03:32:50,930
But did he ask for help?

7458
03:32:50,931 --> 03:32:54,730
What did he get above this dual ready to
fight and then he ran for re decided to

7459
03:32:54,800 --> 03:32:55,810
to call the doctor.

7460
03:32:55,870 --> 03:32:57,730
I would have to be real clear.

7461
03:32:57,731 --> 03:32:58,330
I don't know.

7462
03:32:58,330 --> 03:33:00,730
I think when they were
grabbing his arm in the corner,

7463
03:33:00,731 --> 03:33:02,500
I could have sworn he was telling them.

7464
03:33:02,501 --> 03:33:03,334
It was broken.

7465
03:33:03,360 --> 03:33:04,193
Uh,

7466
03:33:04,750 --> 03:33:07,810
and then he got up and then maybe
they had informed the referee.

7467
03:33:07,840 --> 03:33:09,880
Maybe there was some
confusion in that regard.

7468
03:33:10,270 --> 03:33:11,081
The referee was like,

7469
03:33:11,081 --> 03:33:11,291
oh,

7470
03:33:11,291 --> 03:33:13,030
well we go to the doctor to see this.

7471
03:33:14,280 --> 03:33:14,710
Right.

7472
03:33:14,710 --> 03:33:18,040
But you can't know
ordinarily that can't happen.

7473
03:33:18,040 --> 03:33:18,221
Right.

7474
03:33:18,221 --> 03:33:20,000
Like that was the big issue with the DOL.

7475
03:33:20,010 --> 03:33:21,400
We're Barrow Tim Kennedy Fight,

7476
03:33:21,401 --> 03:33:21,670
right?

7477
03:33:21,670 --> 03:33:22,090
Yeah.

7478
03:33:22,090 --> 03:33:23,690
Tim Kennedy hurts you all.

7479
03:33:23,700 --> 03:33:25,990
Romero has been badly hurt.

7480
03:33:26,020 --> 03:33:29,620
The round ends and the Ramiro
stays on a stool for a long time.

7481
03:33:29,920 --> 03:33:33,910
He stayed on a stool for the full minute
and then stayed on his stool at the end

7482
03:33:33,911 --> 03:33:36,580
of the round and just stayed
there and looked at John McCarthy.

7483
03:33:37,110 --> 03:33:39,420
They cleared out the corner
and it took like a long time.

7484
03:33:39,690 --> 03:33:42,180
I forget like what all the
shenanigans where that was going on,

7485
03:33:42,181 --> 03:33:46,350
but it was clear that he had been hurt
and then time was of the essence and they

7486
03:33:46,351 --> 03:33:47,430
didn't start the route on time.

7487
03:33:47,730 --> 03:33:48,690
So a lot of people thought,

7488
03:33:48,691 --> 03:33:48,811
well,

7489
03:33:48,811 --> 03:33:50,190
the fight should have
been stopped right there.

7490
03:33:50,910 --> 03:33:52,620
I was on that side of the point.

7491
03:33:52,920 --> 03:33:53,580
I was too.

7492
03:33:53,580 --> 03:33:55,020
I think it's very important,

7493
03:33:55,170 --> 03:33:57,150
especially when you're talking
about someone being hurt.

7494
03:33:57,340 --> 03:33:57,900
Yeah,

7495
03:33:57,900 --> 03:33:58,051
right.

7496
03:33:58,051 --> 03:33:58,950
If you heard a guy,

7497
03:33:59,160 --> 03:34:01,290
it's very important that that's,

7498
03:34:01,620 --> 03:34:05,310
you have to allow fire to capitalize on
that and it and giving some an extended

7499
03:34:05,311 --> 03:34:06,570
round just because they're,

7500
03:34:07,140 --> 03:34:09,260
they're just sitting
down there borrow food.

7501
03:34:09,300 --> 03:34:10,430
Tj Dillashaw

7502
03:34:12,300 --> 03:34:13,620
what is that thing on his neck?

7503
03:34:13,900 --> 03:34:15,180
Somebody talked to him and to learn that.

7504
03:34:15,660 --> 03:34:18,510
I think that's his idea that a dog tag,

7505
03:34:18,740 --> 03:34:22,590
the glitter refied that
her dog tag is that like,

7506
03:34:22,610 --> 03:34:23,443
um,

7507
03:34:23,760 --> 03:34:27,120
well they get those at forever
21 they're in that glass,

7508
03:34:27,600 --> 03:34:28,270
that glass,

7509
03:34:28,270 --> 03:34:29,640
a feeling,

7510
03:34:30,070 --> 03:34:31,500
feeling TJC.

7511
03:34:31,501 --> 03:34:34,350
They can get it forever 20
now he's his way class here.

7512
03:34:34,351 --> 03:34:35,840
If way class here.

7513
03:34:35,930 --> 03:34:36,440
Praise.

7514
03:34:36,440 --> 03:34:37,080
I'm just kidding.

7515
03:34:37,080 --> 03:34:38,310
It's probably super expensive.

7516
03:34:38,730 --> 03:34:39,563
But um,

7517
03:34:40,260 --> 03:34:41,550
what's that stuff they put on a deed?

7518
03:34:41,560 --> 03:34:42,620
Quit African art.

7519
03:34:45,490 --> 03:34:49,650
If you a kickbox and mentioned you
got your arm broken the sec around,

7520
03:34:50,640 --> 03:34:53,160
you're stopping you to tell the ref mom,

7521
03:34:53,250 --> 03:34:54,270
I'm not telling them graph.

7522
03:34:54,300 --> 03:34:54,570
If I,

7523
03:34:54,570 --> 03:34:55,291
if I'm good to go,

7524
03:34:55,291 --> 03:34:56,124
I'm going,

7525
03:34:57,220 --> 03:34:58,053
are you good to go?

7526
03:34:58,580 --> 03:34:59,281
If I mean,

7527
03:34:59,281 --> 03:35:00,114
you would know,

7528
03:35:00,240 --> 03:35:00,600
right?

7529
03:35:00,600 --> 03:35:01,920
You will know how bad it hurts.

7530
03:35:02,060 --> 03:35:02,190
Well,

7531
03:35:02,190 --> 03:35:03,000
I mean it would,

7532
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:04,110
it would,

7533
03:35:04,111 --> 03:35:06,420
it depend entirely upon
like where it's broken.

7534
03:35:06,421 --> 03:35:07,740
Like what if it was broken up here?

7535
03:35:08,510 --> 03:35:10,530
Like when Minataro fought Frank Mir.

7536
03:35:10,550 --> 03:35:10,840
Yeah.

7537
03:35:10,840 --> 03:35:12,210
And snap the upper arm.

7538
03:35:12,240 --> 03:35:13,073
Yeah.

7539
03:35:13,200 --> 03:35:14,730
That's a little different
than the forearm,

7540
03:35:14,731 --> 03:35:15,564
isn't it?

7541
03:35:16,500 --> 03:35:16,711
Yeah.

7542
03:35:16,711 --> 03:35:18,520
That's much different than the form then.

7543
03:35:18,580 --> 03:35:20,700
You can't even use that arm at all.

7544
03:35:20,790 --> 03:35:21,310
Yeah,

7545
03:35:21,310 --> 03:35:22,230
it's the forum.

7546
03:35:22,231 --> 03:35:26,040
You can at least move it out of the way
and you could stand like you're gonna

7547
03:35:26,070 --> 03:35:26,670
throw it.

7548
03:35:26,670 --> 03:35:27,420
Yeah.

7549
03:35:27,420 --> 03:35:28,251
Like if you get hurt,

7550
03:35:28,251 --> 03:35:29,160
it's like your hand.

7551
03:35:29,670 --> 03:35:30,080
Yeah.

7552
03:35:30,080 --> 03:35:30,710
I don't know.

7553
03:35:30,710 --> 03:35:31,290
You know,

7554
03:35:31,290 --> 03:35:32,700
you break that upper arm,

7555
03:35:33,600 --> 03:35:35,370
that's a different beast to further up.

7556
03:35:35,371 --> 03:35:35,911
It goes.

7557
03:35:35,911 --> 03:35:37,560
The worse it gets for fighting man,

7558
03:35:37,770 --> 03:35:38,610
break your hands.

7559
03:35:38,611 --> 03:35:40,980
You can still fight and break your form.

7560
03:35:41,010 --> 03:35:42,390
You may be able to fight.

7561
03:35:42,530 --> 03:35:43,120
Right,

7562
03:35:43,120 --> 03:35:43,390
right.

7563
03:35:43,390 --> 03:35:44,550
You chip it or crack it.

7564
03:35:44,551 --> 03:35:45,150
You may be,

7565
03:35:45,150 --> 03:35:45,720
but you,

7566
03:35:45,720 --> 03:35:48,660
you started getting up
here and you bicep area.

7567
03:35:48,690 --> 03:35:50,490
If you've ever seen Ian Mccall's hands.

7568
03:35:51,570 --> 03:35:51,961
Yeah.

7569
03:35:51,961 --> 03:35:56,961
He's broke his hand like a hundred
times or even fucking broken here.

7570
03:35:57,360 --> 03:35:59,880
He can't make a fist and he makes a fist.

7571
03:35:59,881 --> 03:36:00,940
It's like this isn't,

7572
03:36:00,950 --> 03:36:02,550
is one knuckle is always poking out.

7573
03:36:02,551 --> 03:36:03,301
It doesn't close.

7574
03:36:03,301 --> 03:36:04,050
Right.

7575
03:36:04,050 --> 03:36:08,280
And he's had a bunch of operations so
they're trying to figure out what had

7576
03:36:08,281 --> 03:36:09,050
happened.

7577
03:36:09,050 --> 03:36:11,560
So it was somehow it was blocking the kick

7578
03:36:13,790 --> 03:36:14,370
dude.

7579
03:36:14,370 --> 03:36:15,570
I think they isolated it.

7580
03:36:16,170 --> 03:36:17,580
Are they just showing you highlights here?

7581
03:36:18,280 --> 03:36:19,740
It looks like they're
just showing highlights.

7582
03:36:19,920 --> 03:36:20,610
They have no idea.

7583
03:36:20,610 --> 03:36:21,000
Yeah.

7584
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:22,050
I mean who knows?

7585
03:36:23,220 --> 03:36:25,650
But some of Marcus' kicks
fucking heart right there.

7586
03:36:25,680 --> 03:36:26,251
That's probably right.

7587
03:36:26,251 --> 03:36:26,790
It,

7588
03:36:26,790 --> 03:36:28,890
that's probably it started shaking it.

7589
03:36:29,850 --> 03:36:30,270
Yup.

7590
03:36:30,270 --> 03:36:30,571
Yeah.

7591
03:36:30,571 --> 03:36:31,440
And the way he's holding it.

7592
03:36:32,150 --> 03:36:32,940
Yeah.

7593
03:36:32,940 --> 03:36:33,773
That was it.

7594
03:36:33,780 --> 03:36:34,560
It was that kicked.

7595
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:35,393
So that was it.

7596
03:36:35,570 --> 03:36:36,403
They nailed it.

7597
03:36:37,060 --> 03:36:37,451
Yeah man.

7598
03:36:37,451 --> 03:36:41,140
You can't let a guy fight with a fucking
broken arm if you know it's a broken

7599
03:36:41,141 --> 03:36:41,470
arm.

7600
03:36:41,470 --> 03:36:44,170
Like if you want to hide it
even where you can hide it,

7601
03:36:44,320 --> 03:36:47,620
but they have to stop it once it gets
brought to the doctor's attention.

7602
03:36:47,621 --> 03:36:48,454
Yeah.

7603
03:36:48,510 --> 03:36:50,100
Sean Yarbrough broke,

7604
03:36:50,170 --> 03:36:51,003
uh,

7605
03:36:51,330 --> 03:36:56,010
Steven Richards for forum with a body
kick and there's like one lion fight,

7606
03:36:56,011 --> 03:36:58,620
like one of the first line
flight snap just for him.

7607
03:36:58,680 --> 03:37:01,440
And Steven Richards went
on and beat him to the,

7608
03:37:01,470 --> 03:37:03,480
for the decision and the final clip,

7609
03:37:03,540 --> 03:37:05,610
he was just kept clinching him
up and like dumping him and shit.

7610
03:37:05,611 --> 03:37:08,410
But he broke his arm and you could see
like in there holding it after the fight

7611
03:37:08,411 --> 03:37:09,810
and you could see like a huge debt.

7612
03:37:10,320 --> 03:37:11,220
Oh my God,

7613
03:37:11,990 --> 03:37:12,480
this is,

7614
03:37:12,480 --> 03:37:15,150
it's like Jamie Varner
and he broke his ankle.

7615
03:37:15,480 --> 03:37:16,320
Yeah,

7616
03:37:16,660 --> 03:37:17,350
no,

7617
03:37:17,350 --> 03:37:19,750
that should have been stuff
that should have been stopped.

7618
03:37:20,100 --> 03:37:21,220
And that was obvious.

7619
03:37:21,221 --> 03:37:22,510
He can't do anything about that.

7620
03:37:22,511 --> 03:37:22,871
But if he,

7621
03:37:22,871 --> 03:37:24,250
if that would have been his forearm,

7622
03:37:24,280 --> 03:37:25,300
he would've continued it.

7623
03:37:25,780 --> 03:37:26,613
Yeah,

7624
03:37:26,860 --> 03:37:28,210
he went back to his corner.

7625
03:37:28,211 --> 03:37:28,540
Right.

7626
03:37:28,540 --> 03:37:31,840
Did that happen in the first round
quarterback back to his corner.

7627
03:37:31,841 --> 03:37:32,860
And that's when they called it.

7628
03:37:33,460 --> 03:37:35,800
But that happened midway
through the first,

7629
03:37:35,830 --> 03:37:36,930
they didn't make a second.

7630
03:37:36,970 --> 03:37:38,050
He got knocked out.

7631
03:37:39,010 --> 03:37:39,880
He got knocked out,

7632
03:37:41,050 --> 03:37:41,400
plates.

7633
03:37:41,400 --> 03:37:42,400
Tweet came back out.

7634
03:37:43,300 --> 03:37:44,860
I'm pretty sure he came back out.

7635
03:37:45,900 --> 03:37:50,350
What he did get knocked
out and I think it was a,

7636
03:37:52,450 --> 03:37:53,410
was it true Hilo?

7637
03:37:54,010 --> 03:37:54,490
Yeah,

7638
03:37:54,490 --> 03:37:55,330
able to Hilo.

7639
03:37:56,480 --> 03:37:57,140
Yeah.

7640
03:37:57,140 --> 03:37:57,670
No.

7641
03:37:57,670 --> 03:37:58,410
Who is that?

7642
03:37:58,410 --> 03:38:00,530
What does it go back up so
I can see who he's fighting?

7643
03:38:00,680 --> 03:38:01,513
Who is that?

7644
03:38:03,800 --> 03:38:04,633
No.

7645
03:38:08,160 --> 03:38:08,993
Is that it?

7646
03:38:09,780 --> 03:38:10,770
Broken Ankle?

7647
03:38:11,520 --> 03:38:12,090
Nope.

7648
03:38:12,090 --> 03:38:12,930
I don't think this is

7649
03:38:14,930 --> 03:38:15,920
what I'm thinking of.

7650
03:38:16,710 --> 03:38:18,080
He break his ankle more than once.

7651
03:38:18,830 --> 03:38:22,130
What was the fight where he was in
a crazy slug fest with somebody?

7652
03:38:22,160 --> 03:38:22,371
Yeah,

7653
03:38:22,371 --> 03:38:22,551
no,

7654
03:38:22,551 --> 03:38:24,170
that was Afro Reebok deal.

7655
03:38:24,230 --> 03:38:25,400
That was James Kraus.

7656
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:26,450
That's who it is right there.

7657
03:38:26,630 --> 03:38:27,463
Yeah.

7658
03:38:27,590 --> 03:38:27,741
Oh,

7659
03:38:27,741 --> 03:38:28,574
I remember this.

7660
03:38:29,690 --> 03:38:30,111
Oh yeah,

7661
03:38:30,111 --> 03:38:30,944
that's right.

7662
03:38:32,960 --> 03:38:34,220
It just gave out on him.

7663
03:38:34,490 --> 03:38:35,151
That's right.

7664
03:38:35,151 --> 03:38:35,721
That's right.

7665
03:38:35,721 --> 03:38:36,261
That's right.

7666
03:38:36,261 --> 03:38:37,100
Now I remember.

7667
03:38:37,250 --> 03:38:39,170
So I think I confused that.

7668
03:38:39,171 --> 03:38:40,910
And his fight with able to Hilo,

7669
03:38:41,120 --> 03:38:44,900
his fight with able true Hilo was a
slobber knocker and true Hilo wind up

7670
03:38:44,901 --> 03:38:45,860
winning by knockout.

7671
03:38:46,190 --> 03:38:47,210
That's what that was.

7672
03:38:47,540 --> 03:38:48,830
I can fabulous.

7673
03:38:48,840 --> 03:38:52,850
Did the two of them and he went down the
same way that he went down right there.

7674
03:38:52,910 --> 03:38:53,590
Yes.

7675
03:38:53,590 --> 03:38:53,960
Yeah.

7676
03:38:53,960 --> 03:38:55,430
When he got hit with that hook,

7677
03:38:55,850 --> 03:38:57,740
he was making that same move.

7678
03:38:58,790 --> 03:39:01,150
So it looks like weird.

7679
03:39:01,220 --> 03:39:03,620
I had the two memories
confused in my mind.

7680
03:39:06,890 --> 03:39:11,120
Powerful glory from Denver.

7681
03:39:12,140 --> 03:39:12,501
Oh yeah.

7682
03:39:12,501 --> 03:39:13,940
Here's able to Hylo in him.

7683
03:39:14,070 --> 03:39:14,903
Boom,

7684
03:39:17,530 --> 03:39:17,831
boom.

7685
03:39:17,831 --> 03:39:18,350
Right there.

7686
03:39:18,350 --> 03:39:18,970
Yup.

7687
03:39:18,970 --> 03:39:19,541
Exactly.

7688
03:39:19,541 --> 03:39:20,210
The same.

7689
03:39:20,210 --> 03:39:20,460
I,

7690
03:39:20,460 --> 03:39:20,721
you're,

7691
03:39:20,721 --> 03:39:21,850
you were fucking right.

7692
03:39:21,880 --> 03:39:22,780
Eve Edwards.

7693
03:39:23,290 --> 03:39:24,071
He figured it out,

7694
03:39:24,071 --> 03:39:24,904
man.

7695
03:39:25,030 --> 03:39:25,450
Boom.

7696
03:39:25,450 --> 03:39:26,140
God,

7697
03:39:26,140 --> 03:39:26,591
Lord,

7698
03:39:26,591 --> 03:39:28,360
that's a fucking perfect punch,

7699
03:39:30,190 --> 03:39:31,023
man.

7700
03:39:32,690 --> 03:39:33,523
If,

7701
03:39:33,550 --> 03:39:34,070
if I was

7702
03:39:34,070 --> 03:39:36,500
in my prime right now
and I was in the UFC,

7703
03:39:36,501 --> 03:39:37,760
I would have to be a 45.

7704
03:39:37,761 --> 03:39:40,970
These dudes are so much bigger
than we were 10 years ago.

7705
03:39:41,330 --> 03:39:42,440
How do you feel about that?

7706
03:39:42,530 --> 03:39:42,830
What do you,

7707
03:39:42,830 --> 03:39:44,390
what's your feelings about weight cutting?

7708
03:39:45,080 --> 03:39:45,913
My interview on you.

7709
03:39:49,220 --> 03:39:50,120
I'm not a journalist.

7710
03:39:51,020 --> 03:39:51,441
Do you,

7711
03:39:51,441 --> 03:39:52,460
do you approve it?

7712
03:39:53,270 --> 03:39:56,210
Do you think that we'd all be better
off if everybody abandoned it?

7713
03:39:56,630 --> 03:39:58,970
Do you think that it's a smart thing?

7714
03:39:59,770 --> 03:40:01,040
I'm asking too many questions.

7715
03:40:01,130 --> 03:40:01,580
No,

7716
03:40:01,580 --> 03:40:03,110
I don't disapprove of it,

7717
03:40:03,111 --> 03:40:06,950
but I think we would all be better off
in the long run as the fighters would be

7718
03:40:06,951 --> 03:40:08,360
lot better off in the long run,

7719
03:40:08,420 --> 03:40:09,440
but not having to do it.

7720
03:40:09,441 --> 03:40:10,310
There are some guys,

7721
03:40:10,640 --> 03:40:11,061
for me,

7722
03:40:11,061 --> 03:40:12,200
it wasn't miserable.

7723
03:40:12,640 --> 03:40:13,400
Um,

7724
03:40:13,400 --> 03:40:15,500
but there are some guys that it is,

7725
03:40:15,501 --> 03:40:15,721
and,

7726
03:40:15,721 --> 03:40:16,371
and even for me,

7727
03:40:16,371 --> 03:40:20,960
I think I'm still taking some
burning that oil at both ends.

7728
03:40:21,050 --> 03:40:21,311
Um,

7729
03:40:21,311 --> 03:40:23,180
so I burn the candle at
both ends at that point.

7730
03:40:23,570 --> 03:40:24,290
Um,

7731
03:40:24,290 --> 03:40:29,200
but it's not as hard as say some
guys like leasing t bow or um,

7732
03:40:29,270 --> 03:40:29,811
guys that,

7733
03:40:29,811 --> 03:40:31,580
that are much bigger and the weight class,

7734
03:40:31,581 --> 03:40:31,940
you know,

7735
03:40:31,940 --> 03:40:32,620
I think,

7736
03:40:32,620 --> 03:40:32,840
uh,

7737
03:40:32,840 --> 03:40:35,960
in the long run you are putting a
toll on your body that's going to,

7738
03:40:35,961 --> 03:40:37,400
you're going to have to pay the price.

7739
03:40:37,460 --> 03:40:39,230
You're going to have to
pay that tax at some point,

7740
03:40:39,830 --> 03:40:40,310
but,

7741
03:40:40,310 --> 03:40:44,090
and that could come when
you're 50 or you know,

7742
03:40:44,420 --> 03:40:44,960
I don't know,

7743
03:40:44,960 --> 03:40:45,590
whatever.

7744
03:40:45,590 --> 03:40:45,801
Yeah.

7745
03:40:45,801 --> 03:40:50,801
It seems that fighting itself is such an
incredibly difficult task on your body.

7746
03:40:51,140 --> 03:40:56,140
Why would you want to put it through
the task of massive dehydration 24 hours

7747
03:40:56,271 --> 03:40:56,991
before finding,

7748
03:40:56,991 --> 03:40:58,160
it just doesn't make any sense.

7749
03:40:58,730 --> 03:41:01,520
I know that everybody does it
to gain a competitive advantage,

7750
03:41:01,550 --> 03:41:03,890
but wouldn't it be better
if it was just all,

7751
03:41:03,891 --> 03:41:05,320
even even wait,

7752
03:41:05,330 --> 03:41:06,200
like honest,

7753
03:41:06,590 --> 03:41:08,810
like fuck this competitive advantage shit.

7754
03:41:09,020 --> 03:41:09,853
If everybody just,

7755
03:41:10,040 --> 03:41:10,551
first of all,

7756
03:41:10,551 --> 03:41:11,600
there should be more options,

7757
03:41:11,630 --> 03:41:12,020
right?

7758
03:41:12,020 --> 03:41:12,831
I think we all agree on,

7759
03:41:12,831 --> 03:41:16,730
I think that's how you solved the problem
and have a one 70 than a one 85 and a

7760
03:41:16,731 --> 03:41:19,690
two oh five and a to 65 and
expect people to not wait.

7761
03:41:19,700 --> 03:41:22,040
They're gonna fuck a cut
weight 100% right either your,

7762
03:41:22,041 --> 03:41:23,840
your options are fight gorillas.

7763
03:41:24,100 --> 03:41:29,100
I had a to 65 or you way to 30 you know
we gotta deal with fucking chain car

7764
03:41:29,511 --> 03:41:32,500
went on top of you or something like
that and you're a two 30 pounder.

7765
03:41:32,510 --> 03:41:33,021
Fuck that.

7766
03:41:33,021 --> 03:41:36,350
You got to make that two oh five and
you're going to suck it up cause there

7767
03:41:36,351 --> 03:41:38,420
should be a way class every 10 pounds.

7768
03:41:38,990 --> 03:41:41,480
And I think with fighters
like what really matters,

7769
03:41:41,481 --> 03:41:45,380
what everybody cares about
is who the best guys fight.

7770
03:41:45,381 --> 03:41:47,090
Like the best guys fighting the best guys.

7771
03:41:47,390 --> 03:41:47,601
You know,

7772
03:41:47,601 --> 03:41:51,050
whether Norma Grumet off and a
Conor McGregor had a belt or not,

7773
03:41:51,051 --> 03:41:51,650
right?

7774
03:41:51,650 --> 03:41:55,370
If number Grumman off didn't have the
155 pound belt and Conor McGregor didn't

7775
03:41:55,371 --> 03:41:56,690
have the 155 pound belt,

7776
03:41:56,840 --> 03:42:00,740
it would be worth more to
watch those two go at it.

7777
03:42:00,800 --> 03:42:02,120
At 155 pounds,

7778
03:42:02,330 --> 03:42:07,330
then it would for me to watch maybe
Eddie Alvarez defended against somebody

7779
03:42:07,731 --> 03:42:08,564
else.

7780
03:42:08,660 --> 03:42:12,620
You know like I just want to see like
if it was not Connor or not some high

7781
03:42:12,621 --> 03:42:13,370
level guy,

7782
03:42:13,370 --> 03:42:16,070
I'd be more interested in seeing the
high level guys who don't have the belt.

7783
03:42:17,390 --> 03:42:21,770
But if you were to make more weight
classes then you get super fights.

7784
03:42:21,771 --> 03:42:22,580
Yes.

7785
03:42:22,580 --> 03:42:23,360
It's all good,

7786
03:42:23,360 --> 03:42:23,780
right?

7787
03:42:23,780 --> 03:42:24,320
Yeah.

7788
03:42:24,320 --> 03:42:24,640
You,

7789
03:42:24,640 --> 03:42:26,150
you get the hundred and 60 pounds,

7790
03:42:26,151 --> 03:42:30,410
you have anniversary to 150 pound champion
and it's like this is a fight that

7791
03:42:30,411 --> 03:42:33,120
people want to see because it's
not that much of a difference.

7792
03:42:33,810 --> 03:42:34,111
You know,

7793
03:42:34,111 --> 03:42:37,560
they gave people a little bit of a
break by letting fighters way in early.

7794
03:42:37,560 --> 03:42:40,530
Now you could weigh in between like
eight and 10:00 AM and that way,

7795
03:42:40,531 --> 03:42:44,910
by the time the way in ceremony goes on
at like 4:00 PM you're fully hydrated.

7796
03:42:44,911 --> 03:42:45,744
You look good.

7797
03:42:45,840 --> 03:42:47,220
You don't look like death anymore.

7798
03:42:47,460 --> 03:42:47,941
Like Conor,

7799
03:42:47,941 --> 03:42:51,540
when he fought Chad Mendez every that
last time you made 45 you're like,

7800
03:42:51,541 --> 03:42:52,830
what the fuck?

7801
03:42:53,220 --> 03:42:53,940
Like he looks,

7802
03:42:53,940 --> 03:42:56,340
he looks like like a dying person.

7803
03:42:56,940 --> 03:43:00,420
And then he's gonna fight for a
world title 24 hours from now.

7804
03:43:00,421 --> 03:43:02,130
That's a ridiculous practice.

7805
03:43:02,250 --> 03:43:03,440
It's ridiculous that,

7806
03:43:03,540 --> 03:43:03,770
that,

7807
03:43:03,770 --> 03:43:04,120
that,

7808
03:43:04,120 --> 03:43:04,951
that was my thing.

7809
03:43:04,951 --> 03:43:05,401
I'm not,

7810
03:43:05,401 --> 03:43:06,870
I'm not huge fill a class,

7811
03:43:06,871 --> 03:43:11,871
but I was decent sized for the weight
class so I could get down to like one 53

7812
03:43:12,540 --> 03:43:13,590
the day of the weigh in.

7813
03:43:13,591 --> 03:43:17,520
So I would cut to about
one 53 and then get put,

7814
03:43:17,550 --> 03:43:20,370
put about two and a half
pounds of food in my body,

7815
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:21,833
food and water.

7816
03:43:22,020 --> 03:43:23,370
And that's why it weigh ins.

7817
03:43:23,400 --> 03:43:24,233
I was happy.

7818
03:43:24,660 --> 03:43:25,740
I was never measurable.

7819
03:43:26,070 --> 03:43:27,120
It was never sucking it up.

7820
03:43:27,121 --> 03:43:31,380
I mean sometimes you overcut
and then bounce it up.

7821
03:43:31,470 --> 03:43:32,210
Hey,

7822
03:43:32,210 --> 03:43:33,180
interesting.

7823
03:43:33,900 --> 03:43:34,360
But I,

7824
03:43:34,360 --> 03:43:35,790
I was small enough to do that.

7825
03:43:36,260 --> 03:43:37,270
Yeah.

7826
03:43:37,350 --> 03:43:38,850
Usually those last three pounds,

7827
03:43:38,851 --> 03:43:39,420
they're like,

7828
03:43:39,420 --> 03:43:40,120
yeah,

7829
03:43:40,120 --> 03:43:40,830
I would wake up,

7830
03:43:40,830 --> 03:43:41,640
fight morning.

7831
03:43:41,640 --> 03:43:41,791
Um,

7832
03:43:41,791 --> 03:43:46,050
so I weigh in morning at
like 158 maybe if I'm heavy,

7833
03:43:46,051 --> 03:43:49,350
I'm 158 most of the time
to look up at 56 57.

7834
03:43:50,520 --> 03:43:51,210
Well,

7835
03:43:51,210 --> 03:43:56,210
I mean I think you were lucky in the
sense that you were in that your body fit

7836
03:43:56,521 --> 03:43:58,230
right in there with that weight class.

7837
03:43:58,231 --> 03:44:00,720
If you were a little bit
bigger maybe would be an issue.

7838
03:44:00,930 --> 03:44:04,080
Like maybe what if you were a little bit
bigger but not quite big enough for one

7839
03:44:04,081 --> 03:44:06,030
70 you know?

7840
03:44:06,270 --> 03:44:06,690
Yeah.

7841
03:44:06,690 --> 03:44:08,070
Like a Diego Sanchez.

7842
03:44:08,460 --> 03:44:10,290
Diego was kind of a tweener right.

7843
03:44:10,620 --> 03:44:13,830
He was a guy that really struggled to
make 55 I remember the first time I saw

7844
03:44:13,831 --> 03:44:18,180
him when he made 55 I'm pretty sure it
was in England and I remember going Jesus

7845
03:44:18,181 --> 03:44:21,300
like he looks so drawn out at the way in.

7846
03:44:21,301 --> 03:44:25,710
He looked terrible and then he got it
balanced out if figured out how to do it.

7847
03:44:25,711 --> 03:44:29,610
But I don't think ideally his
weight would be 55 I think is ideal.

7848
03:44:29,611 --> 03:44:32,450
We would probably be
like 65 or 60 you know,

7849
03:44:32,480 --> 03:44:33,360
somewhere in that range.

7850
03:44:33,361 --> 03:44:38,361
I think if they went 51 51 60 or (556)
057-0580 five I mean they could do it

7851
03:44:39,571 --> 03:44:40,410
that way easily.

7852
03:44:40,980 --> 03:44:44,100
But 10 pounds I think is like the right,

7853
03:44:44,550 --> 03:44:45,383
the right number.

7854
03:44:45,420 --> 03:44:48,850
So you think the four or
five pounds of boxing is too,

7855
03:44:48,870 --> 03:44:50,700
too small of a weight.

7856
03:44:51,090 --> 03:44:54,150
It's interesting cause I think it's more
of a factor in MMA than it is in boxing

7857
03:44:54,930 --> 03:44:55,490
and wait.

7858
03:44:55,490 --> 03:44:56,160
Yeah.

7859
03:44:56,160 --> 03:44:57,830
And boxing has more options.

7860
03:44:58,110 --> 03:45:01,520
It was just kind of kind
of interesting in a way.

7861
03:45:02,040 --> 03:45:04,770
But obviously boxing is
just got way more history,

7862
03:45:05,230 --> 03:45:05,641
you know,

7863
03:45:05,641 --> 03:45:09,240
it's been around way longer and
people were smaller back then too.

7864
03:45:09,570 --> 03:45:13,110
So it's not like you can eliminate
Slapsie Maxie what it was he,

7865
03:45:13,111 --> 03:45:14,100
is he at light heavyweight?

7866
03:45:14,101 --> 03:45:14,934
No,

7867
03:45:15,210 --> 03:45:17,130
it was Billy conn was a light heavyweight.

7868
03:45:17,131 --> 03:45:17,670
Right.

7869
03:45:17,670 --> 03:45:19,400
And I forget what you,

7870
03:45:19,410 --> 03:45:20,310
when they changed it,

7871
03:45:20,311 --> 03:45:24,720
but I mean heavyweight was 154
pounds and up way back in the day.

7872
03:45:24,870 --> 03:45:25,290
Really?

7873
03:45:25,290 --> 03:45:25,651
Yeah.

7874
03:45:25,651 --> 03:45:29,630
154 pounds more than one 50
volt with heavyweight like in,

7875
03:45:29,631 --> 03:45:30,670
in the early,

7876
03:45:31,810 --> 03:45:34,420
like probably like
twenties and thirties whoa.

7877
03:45:34,480 --> 03:45:35,313
Yeah.

7878
03:45:35,520 --> 03:45:36,220
Well I saw,

7879
03:45:36,220 --> 03:45:37,120
even in California,

7880
03:45:37,121 --> 03:45:39,700
I think it's over 71 75
or something like that.

7881
03:45:39,880 --> 03:45:40,713
It's supposed to be.

7882
03:45:40,720 --> 03:45:43,910
Trying to think of like
classic and technically boxes.

7883
03:45:43,920 --> 03:45:45,400
A heavyweight over one,

7884
03:45:45,460 --> 03:45:46,660
one 76 I think.

7885
03:45:46,810 --> 03:45:47,560
Wow.

7886
03:45:47,560 --> 03:45:48,580
That's crazy.

7887
03:45:49,750 --> 03:45:53,140
Remember when your Roy Jones Jr went
up to heavyweight and beat John Ruiz?

7888
03:45:54,010 --> 03:45:55,150
Holy Shit.

7889
03:45:55,530 --> 03:45:56,363
I remember that.

7890
03:45:56,380 --> 03:45:56,651
Yeah.

7891
03:45:56,651 --> 03:45:57,760
You know he's still fighting.

7892
03:45:57,900 --> 03:45:58,760
Yeah.

7893
03:45:59,140 --> 03:45:59,973
It makes me sad.

7894
03:46:00,030 --> 03:46:00,863
Yeah.

7895
03:46:01,090 --> 03:46:02,260
I love that dude.

7896
03:46:02,730 --> 03:46:04,210
When I was a kid he was like,

7897
03:46:04,570 --> 03:46:05,470
he was superman.

7898
03:46:06,100 --> 03:46:08,500
Roy Jones Jr would fight
rounds without getting hit.

7899
03:46:09,100 --> 03:46:10,450
Like nobody ever did that before.

7900
03:46:11,770 --> 03:46:12,190
He was,

7901
03:46:12,190 --> 03:46:13,780
he was so good.

7902
03:46:13,890 --> 03:46:14,920
You haven't heard of Willie pep?

7903
03:46:15,160 --> 03:46:15,521
Yes,

7904
03:46:15,521 --> 03:46:16,270
of course.

7905
03:46:16,270 --> 03:46:16,470
Oh,

7906
03:46:16,470 --> 03:46:17,303
you heard about?

7907
03:46:17,460 --> 03:46:17,810
Yeah.

7908
03:46:17,810 --> 03:46:19,600
He went around without
actually throwing a punch.

7909
03:46:19,750 --> 03:46:20,170
Yeah.

7910
03:46:20,170 --> 03:46:21,003
That's awesome.

7911
03:46:21,670 --> 03:46:23,230
In the history of copy box.

7912
03:46:23,400 --> 03:46:23,940
Yeah.

7913
03:46:23,940 --> 03:46:27,070
He said he was going to do it and then
he went and did it like he said it

7914
03:46:27,071 --> 03:46:27,790
between rounds.

7915
03:46:27,790 --> 03:46:28,623
Then he went and did it.

7916
03:46:29,170 --> 03:46:33,130
You just couldn't imagine anybody at
that time in particular having better

7917
03:46:33,131 --> 03:46:33,970
footwork.

7918
03:46:34,810 --> 03:46:36,070
It's an amazing,

7919
03:46:36,071 --> 03:46:41,050
like we're boxing went because if you
watch some of the old Jack Johnson stuff,

7920
03:46:41,290 --> 03:46:44,230
you know and you watch
like how how they used to,

7921
03:46:44,500 --> 03:46:46,090
they used to hold their hands differently,

7922
03:46:46,210 --> 03:46:47,800
they threw punches differently,

7923
03:46:47,980 --> 03:46:48,610
you know,

7924
03:46:48,610 --> 03:46:50,230
and then you see some Jack Dempsey like,

7925
03:46:50,260 --> 03:46:50,531
oh,

7926
03:46:50,531 --> 03:46:50,711
okay,

7927
03:46:50,711 --> 03:46:53,920
well this is starting to become a
little bit more like modern boxing.

7928
03:46:54,310 --> 03:46:58,930
This is like some savage
fucking railroad Hobo Dude.

7929
03:47:00,730 --> 03:47:01,690
Fuck people up.

7930
03:47:02,110 --> 03:47:02,920
You know?

7931
03:47:02,920 --> 03:47:03,191
Let me,

7932
03:47:03,191 --> 03:47:04,090
Jack Dempsey was,

7933
03:47:04,091 --> 03:47:08,040
he was scary cat when you
said some savage Hobo Dude,

7934
03:47:08,041 --> 03:47:10,290
it doesn't fuck people up by first.

7935
03:47:10,540 --> 03:47:14,050
My first thing in my brain
that hit me with crazy horse

7936
03:47:16,420 --> 03:47:20,650
crazy horse would be that dude at the
seven 11 that's outside that you think

7937
03:47:20,651 --> 03:47:23,590
he's on something but he will fuck you up.

7938
03:47:23,710 --> 03:47:28,120
He will fuck you up quick to
crazy horse can crack a lack.

7939
03:47:28,150 --> 03:47:29,740
Did you see the fight?

7940
03:47:29,741 --> 03:47:33,820
He just had it I think
is horizon one punch now.

7941
03:47:33,821 --> 03:47:35,950
He was a beast and still is.

7942
03:47:36,400 --> 03:47:37,270
He's a fun dude.

7943
03:47:37,271 --> 03:47:38,200
I hung out with him one night.

7944
03:47:38,201 --> 03:47:39,370
We'd watch k one together.

7945
03:47:39,640 --> 03:47:40,570
We were in the front row.

7946
03:47:40,571 --> 03:47:44,310
It's him and his girlfriend may and
I can't remember who was with her.

7947
03:47:44,311 --> 03:47:46,180
I think it was Eddie Bravo and we owe,

7948
03:47:46,240 --> 03:47:47,850
it was Eddie Bravo and uh,

7949
03:47:47,860 --> 03:47:50,050
we watched k one in la.

7950
03:47:50,080 --> 03:47:52,860
You remember when k one came to
la and they had an MMA fights and,

7951
03:47:53,060 --> 03:47:53,530
whoa,

7952
03:47:53,530 --> 03:47:54,190
there it is.

7953
03:47:54,190 --> 03:47:55,390
Charles Crazy Horse Bennet.

7954
03:47:55,870 --> 03:47:56,411
There he is.

7955
03:47:56,411 --> 03:48:00,040
Rather he was his special dude.

7956
03:48:00,520 --> 03:48:01,960
Some serious fucking power.

7957
03:48:01,961 --> 03:48:04,030
Had some real problems
outside of the cage though.

7958
03:48:05,380 --> 03:48:06,250
Just uh,

7959
03:48:06,610 --> 03:48:08,950
was involved in quite a few altercations.

7960
03:48:09,070 --> 03:48:09,760
Yeah.

7961
03:48:09,760 --> 03:48:11,470
So this was,

7962
03:48:11,471 --> 03:48:12,280
uh,

7963
03:48:12,280 --> 03:48:15,010
was this before or after he
had that brawl with Vandelay?

7964
03:48:15,090 --> 03:48:15,300
Oh,

7965
03:48:15,300 --> 03:48:17,830
this was two weeks ago.

7966
03:48:17,831 --> 03:48:18,670
This was that fight.

7967
03:48:19,120 --> 03:48:20,010
I didn't know which fight this one.

7968
03:48:20,070 --> 03:48:21,300
He got it and then it went crazy.

7969
03:48:21,670 --> 03:48:22,503
The Vandelay.

7970
03:48:28,730 --> 03:48:29,630
He's crazy.

7971
03:48:30,080 --> 03:48:30,681
He's crazy.

7972
03:48:30,681 --> 03:48:31,220
For sure.

7973
03:48:31,220 --> 03:48:31,910
Yeah,

7974
03:48:31,910 --> 03:48:32,810
he's crazy.

7975
03:48:32,930 --> 03:48:33,141
Well,

7976
03:48:33,141 --> 03:48:36,110
he apparently had had a
street fight with Vandelay

7977
03:48:39,880 --> 03:48:40,713
pride.

7978
03:48:41,140 --> 03:48:41,890
Marcel,

7979
03:48:41,890 --> 03:48:42,460
who was it?

7980
03:48:42,460 --> 03:48:43,221
It put him to sleep.

7981
03:48:43,221 --> 03:48:46,490
Cristiana Marcello put them asleep
and a triangle and a street fight.

7982
03:48:47,030 --> 03:48:51,830
And apparently he woke up and then went
over the Vandelay and knocked out cold.

7983
03:48:53,270 --> 03:48:54,800
I don't tell him what the fuck happened.

7984
03:48:55,250 --> 03:48:55,821
But uh,

7985
03:48:55,821 --> 03:48:57,870
and then they jumped
him and beat him up and,

7986
03:48:57,950 --> 03:49:02,630
and Vandelay went out after he got
knocked out cold and then went out and

7987
03:49:02,631 --> 03:49:03,464
fought.

7988
03:49:04,850 --> 03:49:06,920
So he fought in pride and layer.

7989
03:49:07,190 --> 03:49:08,540
The horse went out and fought that night.

7990
03:49:08,570 --> 03:49:09,440
No defaults.

7991
03:49:09,710 --> 03:49:11,330
I think they both fought that night.

7992
03:49:11,331 --> 03:49:11,600
I don't,

7993
03:49:11,600 --> 03:49:15,350
I don't remember where the crazy hos
fought after he knocked out Vandelay but

7994
03:49:15,351 --> 03:49:19,940
I'm almost positive that Vandelay
fought after getting code lease.

7995
03:49:19,990 --> 03:49:22,070
That was depending on who you're asking.

7996
03:49:22,090 --> 03:49:22,520
Right.

7997
03:49:22,520 --> 03:49:25,190
The problem with those pride stories
is I definitely wasn't there,

7998
03:49:25,310 --> 03:49:30,310
but it's pretty much agreed upon
that crazy horse in some way.

7999
03:49:30,500 --> 03:49:33,500
Punched Vandelay Silva in the
face and it was not a good thing.

8000
03:49:34,160 --> 03:49:38,580
And it's pretty much been proven that
Cristiana Marcello choke crazy horse out

8001
03:49:38,581 --> 03:49:39,190
in a triangle.

8002
03:49:39,190 --> 03:49:39,800
Got Them and triangle,

8003
03:49:39,800 --> 03:49:40,633
I've seen the video,

8004
03:49:40,700 --> 03:49:41,930
he puts them to sleep for sure.

8005
03:49:42,230 --> 03:49:44,450
So those two things we know.

8006
03:49:44,451 --> 03:49:46,280
One for sure happened and the other one,

8007
03:49:46,330 --> 03:49:50,930
it's pretty much known that they had
some sort of a fist fight and they crazy

8008
03:49:50,931 --> 03:49:53,000
horse punched him and
crazy horse keeps saying,

8009
03:49:53,001 --> 03:49:53,691
I'll knock you out.

8010
03:49:53,691 --> 03:49:54,670
Just like I did the last time,

8011
03:49:54,680 --> 03:49:55,240
mother fucker.

8012
03:49:55,240 --> 03:49:56,150
You know what happened?

8013
03:49:56,151 --> 03:49:56,331
Yeah.

8014
03:49:56,331 --> 03:49:57,141
You know what happened?

8015
03:49:57,141 --> 03:49:58,100
I knock you the fuck out.

8016
03:49:58,101 --> 03:50:01,370
So that seems to indicate
that that's what took place.

8017
03:50:02,630 --> 03:50:03,350
I Dunno.

8018
03:50:03,350 --> 03:50:05,360
But Vandelay went out
and fought after that.

8019
03:50:06,200 --> 03:50:07,160
That's fucking crazy.

8020
03:50:07,970 --> 03:50:09,650
That's if he really did get knocked out.

8021
03:50:10,100 --> 03:50:11,300
That is fucking crazy.

8022
03:50:11,420 --> 03:50:13,160
Then he went out and he fought after that.

8023
03:50:13,190 --> 03:50:13,701
In Japan.

8024
03:50:13,701 --> 03:50:14,480
You can do anything.

8025
03:50:14,480 --> 03:50:14,631
Yeah.

8026
03:50:14,631 --> 03:50:15,381
This is the fight.

8027
03:50:15,381 --> 03:50:17,180
Jamie found that he's
found the street fight.

8028
03:50:18,650 --> 03:50:20,450
So this is when they go after each other

8029
03:50:22,330 --> 03:50:27,190
and Cristiana Marcel winds up on the
ground with crazy horse was trying to

8030
03:50:27,191 --> 03:50:28,360
fucking ground and pound him.

8031
03:50:30,190 --> 03:50:31,030
He never seen this Joe.

8032
03:50:31,031 --> 03:50:32,210
So Joe,

8033
03:50:32,230 --> 03:50:34,260
I've seen initially this fight in this.

8034
03:50:34,261 --> 03:50:34,390
Yeah,

8035
03:50:34,390 --> 03:50:35,050
for sure.

8036
03:50:35,050 --> 03:50:35,261
Yeah.

8037
03:50:35,261 --> 03:50:38,020
This was a proof that Jujitsu worse.

8038
03:50:38,320 --> 03:50:38,851
Real good man.

8039
03:50:38,851 --> 03:50:39,700
You got jeans on.

8040
03:50:40,750 --> 03:50:41,690
It's hard to get away from them.

8041
03:50:41,710 --> 03:50:42,070
Chines.

8042
03:50:42,070 --> 03:50:42,231
Oh,

8043
03:50:42,231 --> 03:50:43,064
well he gets free.

8044
03:50:43,620 --> 03:50:44,950
I think it goes right back into it.

8045
03:50:44,960 --> 03:50:45,340
Yup.

8046
03:50:45,340 --> 03:50:46,600
Looking for some more grounded pound.

8047
03:50:46,780 --> 03:50:48,490
This is going to be a
good kickbox in fight.

8048
03:50:48,491 --> 03:50:52,060
We should probably watch this cause
this is the final spin or fucked up.

8049
03:50:52,061 --> 03:50:55,440
He changed his shorts as fucking Dick.

8050
03:50:55,690 --> 03:50:56,201
What do you think?

8051
03:50:56,201 --> 03:50:57,034
Why do you think you did that?

8052
03:50:57,050 --> 03:50:59,140
Sponsors probably I probably smart,

8053
03:50:59,200 --> 03:50:59,900
but yeah,

8054
03:50:59,900 --> 03:51:01,390
other ones were doper saying,

8055
03:51:01,450 --> 03:51:02,650
well they were more flashy,

8056
03:51:02,651 --> 03:51:04,510
but this you could read
this sponsor is better.

8057
03:51:04,780 --> 03:51:05,950
That's why he wore them first.

8058
03:51:05,980 --> 03:51:07,520
Just to be sure that they got,

8059
03:51:08,280 --> 03:51:09,071
they're like,

8060
03:51:09,071 --> 03:51:11,440
uh oh it fell down.

8061
03:51:14,760 --> 03:51:16,410
Who's the gentleman he's fighting again?

8062
03:51:16,411 --> 03:51:18,960
How do you say his name as the guy
who looks like Chris Kimonti's was his

8063
03:51:18,961 --> 03:51:19,794
brother.

8064
03:51:20,020 --> 03:51:20,853
I don't know.

8065
03:51:21,540 --> 03:51:22,051
What's his name?

8066
03:51:22,051 --> 03:51:26,440
Jim Bruce Salary or somewhere a blue bell

8067
03:51:26,550 --> 03:51:27,383
bell.

8068
03:51:27,450 --> 03:51:30,210
Garu God guy.

8069
03:51:30,211 --> 03:51:31,620
Roy Belgo.

8070
03:51:31,640 --> 03:51:31,940
Roy.

8071
03:51:31,940 --> 03:51:32,610
Okay.

8072
03:51:32,610 --> 03:51:34,320
Give us a little volume
so we can hear homeboys

8073
03:51:34,980 --> 03:51:35,813
name.

8074
03:51:39,420 --> 03:51:40,740
You gets paid for it.

8075
03:51:41,130 --> 03:51:41,550
Shots,

8076
03:51:41,550 --> 03:51:42,383
which is is that,

8077
03:51:42,770 --> 03:51:43,680
this is a

8078
03:51:46,170 --> 03:51:47,250
ESPN three.

8079
03:51:47,790 --> 03:51:49,440
Have you ever watched ESPN three before?

8080
03:51:49,630 --> 03:51:50,463
Nope.

8081
03:51:51,160 --> 03:51:54,720
I didn't know they had
kickboxing on ESPN at all.

8082
03:51:54,960 --> 03:51:55,670
Yeah,

8083
03:51:55,670 --> 03:51:59,720
I did air this on Sunday
afternoon to ESPN is ESPN.

8084
03:52:00,310 --> 03:52:00,700
Okay,

8085
03:52:00,700 --> 03:52:01,590
so good afternoon.

8086
03:52:02,010 --> 03:52:02,401
Oh,

8087
03:52:02,401 --> 03:52:02,641
nice.

8088
03:52:02,641 --> 03:52:03,474
Right hand over the top.

8089
03:52:05,410 --> 03:52:06,610
I'm waiting for this dude's name

8090
03:52:11,730 --> 03:52:13,390
bell role.

8091
03:52:14,110 --> 03:52:15,070
You,

8092
03:52:16,150 --> 03:52:17,280
I just signed this thing.

8093
03:52:17,460 --> 03:52:18,320
Oh yeah,

8094
03:52:20,050 --> 03:52:20,400
totally.

8095
03:52:20,400 --> 03:52:21,250
The center of the ring.

8096
03:52:21,420 --> 03:52:22,021
Hey Joe Shelley,

8097
03:52:22,021 --> 03:52:24,450
how come kickboxing is so
much more popular in Europe?

8098
03:52:25,210 --> 03:52:25,730
Uh,

8099
03:52:25,730 --> 03:52:26,090
aesthetic.

8100
03:52:26,090 --> 03:52:30,330
The promoters promoted better I guess in
the TV deals might be different there.

8101
03:52:30,390 --> 03:52:30,690
I don't know.

8102
03:52:30,690 --> 03:52:31,523
I don't really know.

8103
03:52:31,680 --> 03:52:31,771
Well,

8104
03:52:31,771 --> 03:52:34,920
isn't it kinda crazy that it
just took off so big in Holland?

8105
03:52:35,190 --> 03:52:37,440
It's big and France big
and a lot of places.

8106
03:52:37,500 --> 03:52:38,110
Yeah,

8107
03:52:38,110 --> 03:52:38,490
it's,

8108
03:52:38,490 --> 03:52:39,080
it is.

8109
03:52:39,080 --> 03:52:40,200
It's really frustrating,

8110
03:52:42,450 --> 03:52:43,590
but it's just way bigger over there.

8111
03:52:43,820 --> 03:52:44,221
All of them.

8112
03:52:44,221 --> 03:52:45,780
It's like they were like national sport.

8113
03:52:46,080 --> 03:52:49,170
The in sports in entertainment market
is kind of self contained though.

8114
03:52:49,580 --> 03:52:50,210
Yeah.

8115
03:52:50,210 --> 03:52:50,730
No.

8116
03:52:50,730 --> 03:52:51,450
Yeah,

8117
03:52:51,450 --> 03:52:52,380
it is kind of right,

8118
03:52:52,470 --> 03:52:52,710
right.

8119
03:52:52,710 --> 03:52:53,491
But don't you mean,

8120
03:52:53,491 --> 03:52:53,761
look,

8121
03:52:53,761 --> 03:52:57,660
obviously we're attracted to this so
I'm trying to like solve this puzzle.

8122
03:52:57,990 --> 03:52:59,190
If I was an investor,

8123
03:52:59,191 --> 03:53:01,650
which was clearly not well,

8124
03:53:01,651 --> 03:53:03,420
I just think it comes down
to the promoter is like,

8125
03:53:03,450 --> 03:53:04,283
this is,

8126
03:53:04,470 --> 03:53:05,303
I'm enjoying them.

8127
03:53:05,440 --> 03:53:06,540
These fights were like that.

8128
03:53:06,541 --> 03:53:07,470
Everything is empty.

8129
03:53:08,400 --> 03:53:08,820
Is it?

8130
03:53:08,820 --> 03:53:09,653
Yeah.

8131
03:53:10,680 --> 03:53:12,090
It's like three rows of seats.

8132
03:53:12,630 --> 03:53:13,350
That's it.

8133
03:53:13,350 --> 03:53:13,950
Yeah.

8134
03:53:13,950 --> 03:53:14,783
Oh Wow.

8135
03:53:15,390 --> 03:53:15,871
Yeah.

8136
03:53:15,871 --> 03:53:16,261
Wow.

8137
03:53:16,261 --> 03:53:17,160
That's crazy.

8138
03:53:19,590 --> 03:53:20,280
It's just,

8139
03:53:20,280 --> 03:53:20,941
Oh my God.

8140
03:53:20,941 --> 03:53:22,290
It's crazy how people make

8141
03:53:24,020 --> 03:53:26,220
these bad decisions and
they don't promote it.

8142
03:53:26,221 --> 03:53:27,054
And that,

8143
03:53:27,330 --> 03:53:28,141
as I was saying earlier,

8144
03:53:28,141 --> 03:53:30,210
it's like you have the,

8145
03:53:30,780 --> 03:53:31,440
you know,

8146
03:53:31,440 --> 03:53:32,490
us wanting to watch it,

8147
03:53:32,520 --> 03:53:33,270
you have the,

8148
03:53:33,270 --> 03:53:36,510
the quality isn't as good fights,

8149
03:53:37,320 --> 03:53:37,830
fights,

8150
03:53:37,830 --> 03:53:38,611
things missing.

8151
03:53:38,611 --> 03:53:39,450
Why isn't it taken off?

8152
03:53:39,451 --> 03:53:40,400
You have a TV deal.

8153
03:53:40,401 --> 03:53:40,860
Why?

8154
03:53:40,860 --> 03:53:42,330
Here's why it hasn't taken off.

8155
03:53:42,360 --> 03:53:43,590
I think I just figured it out.

8156
03:53:44,160 --> 03:53:45,900
You remember when some of those,

8157
03:53:45,901 --> 03:53:46,290
um,

8158
03:53:46,290 --> 03:53:48,050
street fight videos and Mazda doll,

8159
03:53:48,310 --> 03:53:52,530
we used to fight back in the day and
they were saying no kicks know kicks,

8160
03:53:52,920 --> 03:53:53,570
right.

8161
03:53:53,570 --> 03:53:54,403
Yeah.

8162
03:53:54,540 --> 03:53:55,830
People would complain about that.

8163
03:53:56,250 --> 03:53:57,290
I think like,

8164
03:53:57,300 --> 03:54:01,530
and now people are just now starting to
accept it because of MMA or whatever.

8165
03:54:01,531 --> 03:54:03,750
But I think boxing history in,

8166
03:54:03,751 --> 03:54:04,040
in,

8167
03:54:04,040 --> 03:54:07,650
in the u s for so long and in America
been such a self contained sports and

8168
03:54:07,680 --> 03:54:08,940
entertainment industry.

8169
03:54:09,390 --> 03:54:10,100
Um,

8170
03:54:10,100 --> 03:54:10,410
alright,

8171
03:54:10,410 --> 03:54:10,840
so,

8172
03:54:10,840 --> 03:54:14,940
so self contained in the
sports and entertainment
industry that people are just,

8173
03:54:15,050 --> 03:54:16,170
they don't want to see kicks.

8174
03:54:16,171 --> 03:54:16,460
It does.

8175
03:54:16,460 --> 03:54:16,721
It's,

8176
03:54:16,721 --> 03:54:18,690
it's foreign to most Americans.

8177
03:54:18,691 --> 03:54:19,530
It's like it's not,

8178
03:54:19,531 --> 03:54:24,010
it's not what we're used to here
on this side of the world for

8179
03:54:24,010 --> 03:54:24,843
the most part.

8180
03:54:25,210 --> 03:54:26,043
Think about that.

8181
03:54:26,110 --> 03:54:28,690
Like I think there's
probably something to that.

8182
03:54:28,990 --> 03:54:29,830
It's probably something to that.

8183
03:54:29,850 --> 03:54:31,540
But what about Bruce Lee?

8184
03:54:33,090 --> 03:54:35,520
I mean it's cool to go watch his movie.

8185
03:54:35,521 --> 03:54:37,450
So it's critical as Jackie Chan movies,

8186
03:54:37,451 --> 03:54:38,410
but for sleep,

8187
03:54:38,510 --> 03:54:41,570
Ben Damn every UFC hero of all time.

8188
03:54:41,571 --> 03:54:43,190
Like it's not that it's just promoting.

8189
03:54:43,700 --> 03:54:47,000
I think it's just bad people that get
these opportunities to make mistakes and

8190
03:54:47,001 --> 03:54:51,140
they don't do a good job doing
their only job to promote it.

8191
03:54:51,240 --> 03:54:51,421
Well,

8192
03:54:51,421 --> 03:54:52,530
I think it's really hard.

8193
03:54:52,570 --> 03:54:53,161
I'm old man.

8194
03:54:53,161 --> 03:54:55,380
I don't think it's
necessarily that sample.

8195
03:54:55,470 --> 03:54:56,820
I see what you're talking about though.

8196
03:54:56,821 --> 03:54:59,070
As far as like the size of
this arena in particular.

8197
03:54:59,150 --> 03:55:00,830
When have you ever seen a glory,

8198
03:55:01,170 --> 03:55:01,490
uh,

8199
03:55:01,490 --> 03:55:02,323
advertisement?

8200
03:55:02,330 --> 03:55:03,040
Like a

8201
03:55:03,040 --> 03:55:03,640
commercial,

8202
03:55:03,640 --> 03:55:08,640
I don't know ever glory oil or kickboxing
and America needs to do something.

8203
03:55:10,300 --> 03:55:10,510
Oh,

8204
03:55:10,510 --> 03:55:11,830
we just got tagged style.

8205
03:55:11,831 --> 03:55:15,460
Bender was standing in front of them
just trying to move his head and he got

8206
03:55:15,461 --> 03:55:15,851
clipped.

8207
03:55:15,851 --> 03:55:17,590
He got timed and clip with the right hand.

8208
03:55:18,280 --> 03:55:19,113
He got hit hard.

8209
03:55:19,570 --> 03:55:19,721
Oh,

8210
03:55:19,721 --> 03:55:20,381
when you went to high,

8211
03:55:20,381 --> 03:55:21,370
beautiful kick.

8212
03:55:22,330 --> 03:55:23,230
Oh my goodness.

8213
03:55:24,850 --> 03:55:26,590
Belgard Belgar oh,

8214
03:55:26,591 --> 03:55:27,041
there we go.

8215
03:55:27,041 --> 03:55:27,874
We got his name.

8216
03:55:28,540 --> 03:55:29,380
This is awesome.

8217
03:55:31,100 --> 03:55:31,830
Okay.

8218
03:55:31,830 --> 03:55:32,820
The garlic is no joke.

8219
03:55:33,090 --> 03:55:33,841
He's a big tall,

8220
03:55:33,841 --> 03:55:34,800
skinny dude too.

8221
03:55:36,580 --> 03:55:37,413
Hm.

8222
03:55:41,250 --> 03:55:42,960
When you see a guy like semi shell,

8223
03:55:44,100 --> 03:55:48,900
that's when you realize how much like
when utilized correctly reached plays a

8224
03:55:48,901 --> 03:55:49,734
factor.

8225
03:55:49,800 --> 03:55:51,240
He's got his timing down.

8226
03:55:52,820 --> 03:55:55,380
He slipped in that right
hand a little often,

8227
03:55:55,410 --> 03:55:56,950
but he's trying to come
back with that left bell.

8228
03:55:56,970 --> 03:55:59,400
Garu Bell Guy is,

8229
03:55:59,430 --> 03:55:59,970
that's how you say it,

8230
03:55:59,970 --> 03:56:00,803
Jamie,

8231
03:56:01,860 --> 03:56:06,860
but got her Guari Guari re Oui.

8232
03:56:08,160 --> 03:56:11,300
Like we re Gari.

8233
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:12,833
Okay.

8234
03:56:12,930 --> 03:56:14,100
He's from Tunisia.

8235
03:56:14,670 --> 03:56:17,830
They probably don't even
use our letters today.

8236
03:56:18,860 --> 03:56:22,050
They probably got some
cryptic Celtic look in speech.

8237
03:56:22,620 --> 03:56:27,620
What does Tunisia use for language
that was kind of an Asian Tunisian?

8238
03:56:27,990 --> 03:56:28,823
What does it look like?

8239
03:56:29,840 --> 03:56:30,690
It was like Russian.

8240
03:56:32,820 --> 03:56:36,270
I'm just guessing like rushing to me is
the coolest shit ever because it's like

8241
03:56:36,271 --> 03:56:38,220
you're reading some forgotten scrolls,

8242
03:56:38,820 --> 03:56:39,660
you know?

8243
03:56:40,020 --> 03:56:40,560
It was like,

8244
03:56:40,560 --> 03:56:42,360
it's almost like it has characters.

8245
03:56:42,480 --> 03:56:42,751
What is it,

8246
03:56:42,751 --> 03:56:43,500
Jamie?

8247
03:56:43,500 --> 03:56:43,621
Oh,

8248
03:56:43,621 --> 03:56:44,220
it's Arabic.

8249
03:56:44,220 --> 03:56:44,580
Okay.

8250
03:56:44,580 --> 03:56:45,930
So they're writing is an Arabic as well.

8251
03:56:48,330 --> 03:56:49,163
Interesting.

8252
03:56:50,990 --> 03:56:51,330
Yeah.

8253
03:56:51,330 --> 03:56:53,000
Arabic and Hebrew.

8254
03:56:53,040 --> 03:56:53,970
Hebrew was another one.

8255
03:56:54,480 --> 03:56:55,680
That's cool looking language,

8256
03:56:55,681 --> 03:56:56,440
right.

8257
03:56:56,440 --> 03:56:58,590
Looks like speak French apparently.

8258
03:56:58,591 --> 03:57:00,570
Which might be where his last name.

8259
03:57:00,980 --> 03:57:01,150
Ah,

8260
03:57:01,150 --> 03:57:02,040
that makes sense.

8261
03:57:02,130 --> 03:57:03,210
Bed gouty

8262
03:57:04,710 --> 03:57:05,543
interesting.

8263
03:57:08,140 --> 03:57:12,520
The world is so much more diverse
than the eight one eight man.

8264
03:57:12,521 --> 03:57:13,181
You say that.

8265
03:57:13,181 --> 03:57:15,220
But when I came here from Texas I was,

8266
03:57:15,280 --> 03:57:16,001
I mean Texas,

8267
03:57:16,001 --> 03:57:17,740
I thought Texas is pretty diverse in it.

8268
03:57:18,430 --> 03:57:19,480
It is in its own right.

8269
03:57:19,481 --> 03:57:21,590
But in Texas I felt like there were,

8270
03:57:21,620 --> 03:57:22,340
there were,

8271
03:57:22,340 --> 03:57:24,290
there was it in Houston specifically,

8272
03:57:24,380 --> 03:57:27,740
there is a part of Houston
that's a Vietnamese community.

8273
03:57:28,080 --> 03:57:32,810
Then as a part of using that to spa
Hispanic community and then then you have

8274
03:57:32,811 --> 03:57:33,950
black and white people,

8275
03:57:34,310 --> 03:57:38,630
but like you come here and it's like
there's Armenians and there's Russians and

8276
03:57:38,631 --> 03:57:43,631
there is Vietnamese and Koreans and
Chinese and Japanese and like everybody's

8277
03:57:43,791 --> 03:57:43,970
here.

8278
03:57:43,970 --> 03:57:47,440
This is really diverse
compared to what it's like in.

8279
03:57:47,650 --> 03:57:48,483
Gotcha.

8280
03:57:48,500 --> 03:57:48,891
Very good.

8281
03:57:48,891 --> 03:57:49,724
Cracked

8282
03:57:52,000 --> 03:57:52,833
hope to show that

8283
03:57:55,850 --> 03:57:56,611
it was beautiful.

8284
03:57:56,611 --> 03:57:57,444
Right down.

8285
03:58:01,600 --> 03:58:02,433
Um,

8286
03:58:02,890 --> 03:58:03,611
do you feel like,

8287
03:58:03,611 --> 03:58:04,170
uh,

8288
03:58:04,170 --> 03:58:04,931
like a particular,

8289
03:58:04,931 --> 03:58:07,540
like you were saying about
the confederate flags,

8290
03:58:08,170 --> 03:58:13,150
you feel like it's Houston and Texas in
general still has just a little too much

8291
03:58:13,151 --> 03:58:18,151
old stupid shit going on there in
terms of racism and mentality and,

8292
03:58:18,760 --> 03:58:19,241
yeah.

8293
03:58:19,241 --> 03:58:19,840
And it's,

8294
03:58:19,840 --> 03:58:20,673
it's,

8295
03:58:20,710 --> 03:58:21,543
it's not,

8296
03:58:23,380 --> 03:58:26,770
it's weird because it
doesn't exist everywhere.

8297
03:58:26,950 --> 03:58:27,550
Right.

8298
03:58:27,550 --> 03:58:28,030
You know,

8299
03:58:28,030 --> 03:58:28,863
um,

8300
03:58:28,960 --> 03:58:29,950
and I'm sure it's,

8301
03:58:29,951 --> 03:58:32,050
it's kind of even hidden in some places,

8302
03:58:32,051 --> 03:58:34,600
but it's hidden everywhere at some point.

8303
03:58:35,050 --> 03:58:37,220
But in Houston it's

8304
03:58:38,830 --> 03:58:39,910
inside the city,

8305
03:58:40,120 --> 03:58:43,630
it's pretty diverse as far as those
communities that I just mentioned,

8306
03:58:43,631 --> 03:58:45,460
those people are pretty well represented.

8307
03:58:45,940 --> 03:58:48,430
But then when you get on
the outskirts of town,

8308
03:58:49,650 --> 03:58:51,250
and there's a lot of outskirts,

8309
03:58:51,760 --> 03:58:52,930
because here,

8310
03:58:53,560 --> 03:58:53,921
I mean,

8311
03:58:53,921 --> 03:58:54,571
everybody's in,

8312
03:58:54,571 --> 03:58:55,720
in a small area,

8313
03:58:55,960 --> 03:59:00,550
it's like I drive 10 miles here
and it takes me 30 minutes.

8314
03:59:00,880 --> 03:59:01,571
But in Houston,

8315
03:59:01,571 --> 03:59:03,280
10 miles takes me 10 minutes.

8316
03:59:04,360 --> 03:59:07,900
I say there's so many more people
here and it's such a smaller area.

8317
03:59:08,470 --> 03:59:11,560
So it also gives rural real quick.

8318
03:59:11,950 --> 03:59:12,551
In Texas.

8319
03:59:12,551 --> 03:59:12,760
Yeah,

8320
03:59:12,760 --> 03:59:13,593
for sure.

8321
03:59:13,960 --> 03:59:15,730
It gets wild pigs rural,

8322
03:59:16,810 --> 03:59:17,643
you know,

8323
03:59:17,720 --> 03:59:17,970
if,

8324
03:59:17,970 --> 03:59:18,760
if you,

8325
03:59:18,760 --> 03:59:19,990
if you get on a highway,

8326
03:59:21,190 --> 03:59:23,000
if you're on a highway in Texas,

8327
03:59:23,320 --> 03:59:25,230
any direction you start and stay,

8328
03:59:25,240 --> 03:59:26,500
you start in the center of Houston,

8329
03:59:26,890 --> 03:59:27,970
you get on a highway,

8330
03:59:28,030 --> 03:59:30,700
it would no traffic any
direction in 30 minutes.

8331
03:59:30,701 --> 03:59:31,534
You're,

8332
03:59:32,020 --> 03:59:32,351
you know,

8333
03:59:32,351 --> 03:59:33,760
you're not in the city anymore.

8334
03:59:33,820 --> 03:59:33,990
You're,

8335
03:59:33,990 --> 03:59:34,511
you're,

8336
03:59:34,511 --> 03:59:38,050
you're aware houses are far apart
and they're huge and they're,

8337
03:59:38,740 --> 03:59:39,573
you know,

8338
03:59:40,140 --> 03:59:42,130
those ranches people,

8339
03:59:42,420 --> 03:59:45,430
giant swaths of land
with probably 45 minutes.

8340
03:59:45,700 --> 03:59:47,470
Wild pigs running around.

8341
03:59:48,100 --> 03:59:48,281
Yeah.

8342
03:59:48,281 --> 03:59:49,520
Texas is a trap.

8343
03:59:49,521 --> 03:59:50,241
It really is.

8344
03:59:50,241 --> 03:59:51,580
It's one of the weirdest states.

8345
03:59:52,170 --> 03:59:53,290
It's one of my favorite though.

8346
03:59:53,770 --> 03:59:54,640
Such a wild,

8347
03:59:54,641 --> 03:59:55,474
crazy place.

8348
03:59:56,170 --> 03:59:57,850
But yeah,

8349
03:59:57,851 --> 03:59:58,630
it's um,

8350
03:59:58,630 --> 04:00:00,280
it's very unique in that aspect.

8351
04:00:00,281 --> 04:00:01,720
Like how big it is too.

8352
04:00:01,790 --> 04:00:02,310
It's big.

8353
04:00:02,310 --> 04:00:03,730
We got 85 mile an hour.

8354
04:00:03,731 --> 04:00:04,564
Highway

8355
04:00:07,870 --> 04:00:09,310
55 was the limit.

8356
04:00:09,850 --> 04:00:12,520
What in the fuck was going on with people?

8357
04:00:13,750 --> 04:00:17,410
55 that was crazy.

8358
04:00:17,680 --> 04:00:18,450
That is crazy.

8359
04:00:18,450 --> 04:00:18,791
It was just,

8360
04:00:18,791 --> 04:00:19,560
so,

8361
04:00:19,560 --> 04:00:19,861
it's like,

8362
04:00:19,861 --> 04:00:20,010
come

8363
04:00:20,010 --> 04:00:20,700
on,

8364
04:00:20,700 --> 04:00:22,560
we're not talking about like a model t,

8365
04:00:22,860 --> 04:00:23,101
you know,

8366
04:00:23,101 --> 04:00:25,890
these cars are safe and
competent and above speeds.

8367
04:00:26,380 --> 04:00:30,540
The 55 of my car says it can
go one 40 it's just stupid.

8368
04:00:31,230 --> 04:00:33,810
I mean not that you should be
gone one 40 but you know what?

8369
04:00:33,811 --> 04:00:36,210
That's an interesting argument
about the Audubon man.

8370
04:00:36,480 --> 04:00:36,721
I mean,

8371
04:00:36,721 --> 04:00:39,000
I don't necessarily know
it's a bad one either.

8372
04:00:39,001 --> 04:00:39,990
Like what adults do?

8373
04:00:39,991 --> 04:00:44,580
Whatever the fuck they want know and
just have good etiquette move over when

8374
04:00:44,581 --> 04:00:46,470
there's a faster car coming behind you.

8375
04:00:46,560 --> 04:00:48,210
What's the statistics on that?

8376
04:00:49,980 --> 04:00:51,390
Bond is actually safer.

8377
04:00:51,860 --> 04:00:54,030
Bet people get the fuck out of the way.

8378
04:00:54,031 --> 04:00:54,391
Like this.

8379
04:00:54,391 --> 04:00:56,220
Some bad shit going on
in any of the other ones.

8380
04:00:56,840 --> 04:00:58,680
So something a couple days ago,

8381
04:00:58,681 --> 04:00:59,820
I don't remember where I saw it.

8382
04:00:59,840 --> 04:01:00,070
I,

8383
04:01:00,070 --> 04:01:00,781
if I can find it,

8384
04:01:00,781 --> 04:01:01,441
I'll send it to you.

8385
04:01:01,441 --> 04:01:05,860
But they were talking about
how people get over out of the,

8386
04:01:06,050 --> 04:01:08,330
the fast lane on the Autobahn.

8387
04:01:08,340 --> 04:01:12,330
People don't stay in the fast and they
just use that lane to pass and get out of

8388
04:01:12,331 --> 04:01:12,930
that lane.

8389
04:01:12,930 --> 04:01:13,830
That's what it should be.

8390
04:01:14,850 --> 04:01:15,511
That's what it should be.

8391
04:01:15,511 --> 04:01:16,720
That's the passing lane ran.

8392
04:01:16,800 --> 04:01:17,070
Yeah.

8393
04:01:17,070 --> 04:01:19,290
It's supposed to be just La.

8394
04:01:19,291 --> 04:01:21,450
They're just have total
disregard for that shit.

8395
04:01:21,760 --> 04:01:26,050
Never been to a place that has more
disregard for the left lane in La are

8396
04:01:26,160 --> 04:01:26,570
really?

8397
04:01:26,570 --> 04:01:26,730
Yeah.

8398
04:01:26,730 --> 04:01:28,020
Nobody can sound the left lane.

8399
04:01:28,110 --> 04:01:29,490
And I watched people get mad.

8400
04:01:29,491 --> 04:01:31,740
People pull up behind people
and watch them get pissed.

8401
04:01:31,940 --> 04:01:32,820
The fuck the fuck.

8402
04:01:32,821 --> 04:01:34,050
Like oh you must be new.

8403
04:01:36,660 --> 04:01:39,360
Because in Boston people,

8404
04:01:39,390 --> 04:01:41,220
first of all they have will small roads.

8405
04:01:41,280 --> 04:01:45,100
Like in Boston you could be on a highway
and it's two lanes on each side and

8406
04:01:45,140 --> 04:01:47,340
there's some stupid little
rinky dank highways.

8407
04:01:47,341 --> 04:01:50,910
They were invented pack when people
wrote buggies and horses and shit.

8408
04:01:51,000 --> 04:01:51,870
They just paved them.

8409
04:01:51,960 --> 04:01:52,231
Yeah,

8410
04:01:52,231 --> 04:01:53,820
they just paved over those fucking things.

8411
04:01:53,821 --> 04:01:55,110
That's how you got to get to the Cape.

8412
04:01:55,420 --> 04:01:57,500
You gotta take these to get to Cape Cod.

8413
04:01:57,501 --> 04:02:01,230
You gotta take these stupid ass roads
that are like two lanes long in some spots

8414
04:02:01,290 --> 04:02:02,820
are two lanes wide and soft spots.

8415
04:02:03,090 --> 04:02:04,380
So when someone's coming behind you,

8416
04:02:04,381 --> 04:02:05,520
there's no options.

8417
04:02:05,540 --> 04:02:06,373
Just get over,

8418
04:02:06,720 --> 04:02:07,021
you know?

8419
04:02:07,021 --> 04:02:09,540
So people usually respect that left lane.

8420
04:02:10,040 --> 04:02:11,460
You New York is a lot of that too,

8421
04:02:11,461 --> 04:02:12,150
man.

8422
04:02:12,150 --> 04:02:16,290
Like there's a lot of like rinky dink
streets so you wouldn't believe on the way

8423
04:02:16,291 --> 04:02:21,070
to the airport when you leave New York
and you've got to go through a what?

8424
04:02:21,080 --> 04:02:21,571
What is it,

8425
04:02:21,571 --> 04:02:24,420
queens or what is it that
you got to go through?

8426
04:02:24,421 --> 04:02:25,254
Brooklyn?

8427
04:02:25,560 --> 04:02:26,670
Depends on which airport.

8428
04:02:26,671 --> 04:02:27,060
Right?

8429
04:02:27,060 --> 04:02:28,890
Laguardia and JFK.

8430
04:02:29,100 --> 04:02:31,110
Either way you leave Manhattan,

8431
04:02:31,650 --> 04:02:33,240
those towns that you have to go through,

8432
04:02:33,510 --> 04:02:37,680
there's sometimes you're driving on these
little tiny ass fucking super narrow

8433
04:02:37,681 --> 04:02:38,520
roads and you're like,

8434
04:02:38,521 --> 04:02:39,354
this is it.

8435
04:02:39,540 --> 04:02:41,820
This is all these fucking
people are going to the airport.

8436
04:02:41,850 --> 04:02:42,810
Like this is crazy,

8437
04:02:43,240 --> 04:02:48,240
but you can use that for oh five in la
where it's just lanes on this side lanes

8438
04:02:50,251 --> 04:02:51,120
on that side.

8439
04:02:51,690 --> 04:02:52,710
I lived in Houston,

8440
04:02:52,711 --> 04:02:53,510
man,

8441
04:02:53,510 --> 04:02:56,700
I 10 in Houston in the Katy area.

8442
04:02:57,150 --> 04:03:01,380
There's five lanes on heading
west and his five lanes.

8443
04:03:01,381 --> 04:03:02,214
Any east,

8444
04:03:02,340 --> 04:03:06,070
I think it's five and then
there are two or three we have.

8445
04:03:06,100 --> 04:03:06,930
You don't have them here.

8446
04:03:06,930 --> 04:03:07,500
Feeders.

8447
04:03:07,500 --> 04:03:09,540
We have feeder roads in
service roads in Texas,

8448
04:03:09,541 --> 04:03:10,920
so next to the highway.

8449
04:03:10,921 --> 04:03:15,180
If I wanted to drive from
downtown Houston to Katy,

8450
04:03:15,210 --> 04:03:18,310
which is probably 15 to 20 I can do that

8451
04:03:18,370 --> 04:03:22,300
next to the freeway without actually
getting on the freeway because I not

8452
04:03:22,301 --> 04:03:22,811
because,

8453
04:03:22,811 --> 04:03:26,140
but there are people that do this
because they're afraid to drive it.

8454
04:03:26,141 --> 04:03:27,040
Those high speeds.

8455
04:03:27,340 --> 04:03:32,020
So there are stop lights at
every intersection on this
feeder road that's next

8456
04:03:32,021 --> 04:03:32,854
to the highway.

8457
04:03:33,070 --> 04:03:34,870
It's a 35 mile an hour street,

8458
04:03:35,050 --> 04:03:37,390
but it feeds right on to the highway.

8459
04:03:37,420 --> 04:03:38,710
There's a picture of it right there.

8460
04:03:39,240 --> 04:03:39,880
Yeah.

8461
04:03:39,880 --> 04:03:42,010
So those little roads on the side,

8462
04:03:42,400 --> 04:03:43,960
those roads feed onto the highway.

8463
04:03:43,961 --> 04:03:44,621
When you exit,

8464
04:03:44,621 --> 04:03:46,480
you exit off onto the side like that.

8465
04:03:47,590 --> 04:03:49,420
That's actually a really good idea.

8466
04:03:49,750 --> 04:03:50,170
I don't,

8467
04:03:50,170 --> 04:03:50,620
I don't,

8468
04:03:50,620 --> 04:03:51,440
I think,

8469
04:03:51,440 --> 04:03:56,440
do you see how much rote that's 13
lanes of road or [inaudible] 14 lanes of

8470
04:03:56,861 --> 04:03:57,341
highway water?

8471
04:03:57,341 --> 04:03:58,174
The better,

8472
04:03:58,710 --> 04:03:59,650
the more the better.

8473
04:03:59,651 --> 04:04:00,490
I'm not in a waiting.

8474
04:04:02,680 --> 04:04:04,450
I think we should just
make it all highway.

8475
04:04:04,451 --> 04:04:05,590
Why we fucking around?

8476
04:04:05,610 --> 04:04:06,030
Right.

8477
04:04:06,030 --> 04:04:08,620
We need to have floating houses
and everything else is highway.

8478
04:04:09,940 --> 04:04:11,670
Just shoot right up to
your floating house.

8479
04:04:12,300 --> 04:04:15,060
It's what point in time do we tell
people we can't build any more houses?

8480
04:04:17,240 --> 04:04:17,440
Were,

8481
04:04:17,440 --> 04:04:17,710
were,

8482
04:04:17,710 --> 04:04:18,543
were

8483
04:04:18,990 --> 04:04:20,520
I think about things like that.

8484
04:04:20,960 --> 04:04:21,140
We,

8485
04:04:21,140 --> 04:04:21,511
if we,

8486
04:04:21,511 --> 04:04:22,770
if we survive,

8487
04:04:23,010 --> 04:04:26,850
if there are species survives for
another couple of hundred years,

8488
04:04:27,270 --> 04:04:27,511
yeah.

8489
04:04:27,511 --> 04:04:30,810
There's going to be no more trees or
plants or like everything is going to be

8490
04:04:30,811 --> 04:04:32,280
house then we have to build up.

8491
04:04:33,720 --> 04:04:35,970
Well there's a lot of space right now,

8492
04:04:36,180 --> 04:04:39,180
but there's so much more people
now than there's ever been before.

8493
04:04:39,181 --> 04:04:40,620
Like by a long shot.

8494
04:04:40,650 --> 04:04:40,951
Yeah.

8495
04:04:40,951 --> 04:04:41,701
Think about like,

8496
04:04:41,701 --> 04:04:42,660
think about the uh,

8497
04:04:42,661 --> 04:04:47,640
the increase in people over the last
just a few years over the last century.

8498
04:04:47,820 --> 04:04:48,121
Yeah.

8499
04:04:48,121 --> 04:04:53,100
I mean I think we were talking
about it once where it was 1970.

8500
04:04:53,420 --> 04:04:54,980
There was 2 billion people on the planet.

8501
04:04:55,010 --> 04:04:55,780
Was that what it was?

8502
04:04:55,780 --> 04:04:56,080
No.

8503
04:04:56,080 --> 04:04:56,331
What does it,

8504
04:04:56,331 --> 04:04:57,260
Jamie boy,

8505
04:04:57,320 --> 04:04:58,460
you were talking about this the other day.

8506
04:04:58,580 --> 04:05:02,170
There's some people say that we could be
on a decline right now to those people.

8507
04:05:02,180 --> 04:05:02,800
Right.

8508
04:05:02,800 --> 04:05:03,170
Smarter,

8509
04:05:03,170 --> 04:05:05,180
younger people are not having babies.

8510
04:05:05,350 --> 04:05:06,280
Whatever.

8511
04:05:06,980 --> 04:05:08,510
I've heard that argument before.

8512
04:05:08,511 --> 04:05:12,510
I think it's horse shit cause the
dummies or having 1520 kids and makeup of

8513
04:05:12,520 --> 04:05:15,860
those smart people they know declines
going on and it might be a d client.

8514
04:05:15,861 --> 04:05:17,260
Smart people in mind.

8515
04:05:17,261 --> 04:05:18,260
New York borough.

8516
04:05:18,261 --> 04:05:21,140
I've noticed in my co
op there's a decrease.

8517
04:05:21,290 --> 04:05:23,030
Smart people having babies.

8518
04:05:23,270 --> 04:05:25,250
Everybody should be
allowed to make one copy.

8519
04:05:25,670 --> 04:05:26,031
Yeah,

8520
04:05:26,031 --> 04:05:27,380
there's a lot of copies out there.

8521
04:05:27,381 --> 04:05:29,210
Have some really shitty original work.

8522
04:05:30,380 --> 04:05:31,700
That's a part of the problem.

8523
04:05:33,130 --> 04:05:37,010
Like just the sheer genetic
tools that you had to work with.

8524
04:05:37,011 --> 04:05:38,330
We're not the best

8525
04:05:40,400 --> 04:05:41,030
one.

8526
04:05:41,030 --> 04:05:41,271
Okay.

8527
04:05:41,271 --> 04:05:41,721
Here it is.

8528
04:05:41,721 --> 04:05:42,470
Japan,

8529
04:05:42,470 --> 04:05:42,981
Japan.

8530
04:05:42,981 --> 04:05:44,810
Well Japan has a giant issue though.

8531
04:05:44,811 --> 04:05:45,710
They they do,

8532
04:05:45,950 --> 04:05:47,120
they have a weird issue.

8533
04:05:47,720 --> 04:05:48,231
They have a,

8534
04:05:48,231 --> 04:05:51,710
an issue of a lot of people that
are choosing to not get married,

8535
04:05:51,711 --> 04:05:53,630
not have sex there.

8536
04:05:53,631 --> 04:05:56,120
They have people that are
choosing to stay at home like,

8537
04:05:56,810 --> 04:06:00,590
like really as they're getting older
and massive population decline.

8538
04:06:00,860 --> 04:06:01,693
Wow.

8539
04:06:02,650 --> 04:06:03,250
Don't know.

8540
04:06:03,250 --> 04:06:04,400
I don't want to hear the decline.

8541
04:06:04,401 --> 04:06:05,480
I want to know what was the,

8542
04:06:05,540 --> 04:06:10,540
what was the population in 1970 world
world population 1970 so us was 200 200

8543
04:06:15,860 --> 04:06:16,040
million.

8544
04:06:16,040 --> 04:06:19,220
So it's 300,000,050 now,

8545
04:06:19,221 --> 04:06:20,360
350 million now

8546
04:06:22,210 --> 04:06:22,730
billion.

8547
04:06:22,730 --> 04:06:27,730
So 3.7 billion in 1970 so since
1970 the world has doubled.

8548
04:06:28,550 --> 04:06:33,550
The world doubled in the United
States has gone up by 50% right.

8549
04:06:35,660 --> 04:06:37,420
So I guess growth is slowing.

8550
04:06:37,430 --> 04:06:37,670
Wait,

8551
04:06:37,670 --> 04:06:41,510
so the world is dealt with 50%
not 50% of the world doubling.

8552
04:06:41,511 --> 04:06:41,900
Okay.

8553
04:06:41,900 --> 04:06:42,261
Right.

8554
04:06:42,261 --> 04:06:43,610
50% of what the United States,

8555
04:06:43,611 --> 04:06:48,611
why the United States was 200 million
and now it's 300 million plus,

8556
04:06:48,860 --> 04:06:49,220
right?

8557
04:06:49,220 --> 04:06:50,360
That's 50% isn't it?

8558
04:06:54,890 --> 04:06:55,310
Yeah.

8559
04:06:55,310 --> 04:06:55,930
Yeah.

8560
04:06:55,930 --> 04:06:56,740
That's a lot.

8561
04:06:56,740 --> 04:06:58,210
But the world is doubled.

8562
04:06:58,330 --> 04:07:00,940
So the world went up 100% so we are,

8563
04:07:01,510 --> 04:07:06,340
we're at a slower pace than some of
those poor fools that live in other,

8564
04:07:06,940 --> 04:07:07,773
other countries.

8565
04:07:08,250 --> 04:07:11,290
It was poor people not
blessed to be American.

8566
04:07:11,420 --> 04:07:13,100
After this decision.

8567
04:07:13,101 --> 04:07:15,620
I need an audio pause so
my tape doesn't stop here.

8568
04:07:15,680 --> 04:07:16,340
Oh,

8569
04:07:16,340 --> 04:07:17,930
that's something might
happen with the tri caster.

8570
04:07:17,931 --> 04:07:18,320
I can,

8571
04:07:18,320 --> 04:07:19,430
something might have happened with it.

8572
04:07:19,490 --> 04:07:21,110
It says I'm running out of space.

8573
04:07:21,140 --> 04:07:21,790
What does that mean?

8574
04:07:21,790 --> 04:07:21,881
Well,

8575
04:07:21,881 --> 04:07:25,140
now I don't know if that means
it's going to cut the whole Edison.

8576
04:07:25,270 --> 04:07:25,820
Yeah,

8577
04:07:25,820 --> 04:07:26,710
I don't need this space,

8578
04:07:26,711 --> 04:07:26,930
but,

8579
04:07:26,930 --> 04:07:27,290
okay,

8580
04:07:27,290 --> 04:07:28,400
well let's pause now.

8581
04:07:28,750 --> 04:07:29,810
Only like five seconds.

8582
04:07:30,410 --> 04:07:31,280
We'll be right back.

8583
04:07:32,610 --> 04:07:33,860
Is a youtube still up?

8584
04:07:34,280 --> 04:07:35,113
Okay.

8585
04:07:35,660 --> 04:07:37,340
So what's wrong with the tri caster?

8586
04:07:41,580 --> 04:07:41,971
So,

8587
04:07:41,971 --> 04:07:42,570
uh,

8588
04:07:42,570 --> 04:07:44,420
it says I'm running out of spaces.

8589
04:07:44,490 --> 04:07:46,890
There's less than two gigs of space left,

8590
04:07:47,420 --> 04:07:51,480
right on the tri caster and cause I
record and stream at the same time just in

8591
04:07:51,481 --> 04:07:52,410
case something goes wrong.

8592
04:07:52,500 --> 04:07:53,790
So the recording is going to stop.

8593
04:07:53,791 --> 04:07:55,150
I don't know if the streets and stuff.

8594
04:07:55,480 --> 04:07:56,170
Hmm.

8595
04:07:56,170 --> 04:07:57,610
But you don't need that recording anyway,

8596
04:07:57,611 --> 04:07:57,940
right?

8597
04:07:57,940 --> 04:07:58,301
Yeah.

8598
04:07:58,301 --> 04:08:00,670
I don't know if it's going to shut
the whole machine off or not though.

8599
04:08:00,820 --> 04:08:01,390
Oh,

8600
04:08:01,390 --> 04:08:02,020
I don't think it was.

8601
04:08:02,020 --> 04:08:02,853
That's not good.

8602
04:08:03,530 --> 04:08:03,951
All right.

8603
04:08:03,951 --> 04:08:07,330
We're good to do your best job in
January was just getting ready in case

8604
04:08:07,331 --> 04:08:08,164
something happens.

8605
04:08:10,800 --> 04:08:11,633
It's

8606
04:08:12,560 --> 04:08:13,393
all good.

8607
04:08:18,450 --> 04:08:19,680
We're not talking right now.

8608
04:08:21,570 --> 04:08:22,880
Israel has got,

8609
04:08:22,890 --> 04:08:24,600
is a nice cup there.

8610
04:08:25,290 --> 04:08:26,070
One his trophy.

8611
04:08:26,070 --> 04:08:27,480
We back back up.

8612
04:08:27,990 --> 04:08:28,380
Okay.

8613
04:08:28,380 --> 04:08:29,213
Okay.

8614
04:08:29,910 --> 04:08:30,421
So yeah,

8615
04:08:30,421 --> 04:08:30,870
man,

8616
04:08:30,870 --> 04:08:35,870
the world population has gone up double
in the u s population has gone up a

8617
04:08:36,240 --> 04:08:38,790
hundred million at one point in time.

8618
04:08:39,270 --> 04:08:43,020
If you think 1973 point 7 million
and now more than 7 million,

8619
04:08:44,130 --> 04:08:46,230
what is that going to
be 50 years from now?

8620
04:08:46,470 --> 04:08:47,090
No,

8621
04:08:47,090 --> 04:08:48,180
that's not going to be double.

8622
04:08:48,210 --> 04:08:49,320
It's going to be double again.

8623
04:08:49,910 --> 04:08:51,210
Is it 14 then?

8624
04:08:51,270 --> 04:08:52,103
What does that mean?

8625
04:08:52,260 --> 04:08:54,060
What's it like with the world?

8626
04:08:54,120 --> 04:08:55,260
So that's billions.

8627
04:08:55,350 --> 04:08:55,570
Yeah.

8628
04:08:55,570 --> 04:08:58,740
Look with a project by 2050
they projected 9 billion.

8629
04:08:59,760 --> 04:09:00,031
Yeah,

8630
04:09:00,031 --> 04:09:01,200
the world's billions.

8631
04:09:01,640 --> 04:09:02,310
It's interesting.

8632
04:09:02,310 --> 04:09:07,310
So between 1950 and 2050 in a
hundred years it goes up 7 billion.

8633
04:09:09,690 --> 04:09:10,523
Good Lord.

8634
04:09:11,340 --> 04:09:11,630
Yeah.

8635
04:09:11,630 --> 04:09:14,100
There's a stat that says that
the whole population could

8636
04:09:14,100 --> 04:09:15,210
like fit in Texas.

8637
04:09:15,510 --> 04:09:17,570
Have you ever heard that
those people are assholes?

8638
04:09:17,620 --> 04:09:18,020
No.

8639
04:09:18,020 --> 04:09:19,140
Nobody says that as an asshole.

8640
04:09:20,670 --> 04:09:22,440
Spots in Texas that you can't live in.

8641
04:09:22,530 --> 04:09:25,110
There's just heela monsters
and fucking cactuses and shit.

8642
04:09:27,740 --> 04:09:28,860
If you had the fucking,

8643
04:09:29,130 --> 04:09:31,170
all the population he
tried to fit them in Texas,

8644
04:09:31,171 --> 04:09:32,280
they want of eating each other.

8645
04:09:32,360 --> 04:09:34,080
It'd be no food like,

8646
04:09:34,170 --> 04:09:34,531
yeah.

8647
04:09:34,531 --> 04:09:34,801
Yeah,

8648
04:09:34,801 --> 04:09:36,570
you could kind of fit them physically,

8649
04:09:37,470 --> 04:09:39,900
but like not like resource wise.

8650
04:09:41,820 --> 04:09:43,290
Texas is a good place to go though.

8651
04:09:43,291 --> 04:09:45,390
If the shit hits the fan and it was hot,

8652
04:09:45,780 --> 04:09:46,470
it's hot.

8653
04:09:46,470 --> 04:09:50,460
But there's a lot of people that have
figured out how to be off the grid or

8654
04:09:50,550 --> 04:09:52,290
mostly off the grid there.

8655
04:09:52,470 --> 04:09:54,690
You'd get a thousand
square feet per person.

8656
04:09:54,780 --> 04:09:57,810
If we got 6.9 billion people in Texas,

8657
04:09:57,811 --> 04:10:00,630
which there's still 500
million people left over,

8658
04:10:01,350 --> 04:10:02,310
so what does that mean?

8659
04:10:02,480 --> 04:10:03,313
That's just a,

8660
04:10:03,430 --> 04:10:06,150
you could get a thousand
square foot apartment.

8661
04:10:06,210 --> 04:10:06,481
Yeah,

8662
04:10:06,481 --> 04:10:08,030
but that doesn't mean that even apartment,

8663
04:10:08,040 --> 04:10:10,410
I think it's like literal
feet on the ground.

8664
04:10:10,411 --> 04:10:10,890
Like,

8665
04:10:10,890 --> 04:10:11,251
oh,

8666
04:10:11,251 --> 04:10:12,084
I see.

8667
04:10:13,020 --> 04:10:15,300
No way everyone can fit in Texas.

8668
04:10:15,330 --> 04:10:15,750
Okay.

8669
04:10:15,750 --> 04:10:16,950
So they wouldn't be able to,

8670
04:10:17,640 --> 04:10:20,880
so they like the physical size of
the people would not be able to fit.

8671
04:10:21,780 --> 04:10:22,980
There's too many people to fit.

8672
04:10:23,250 --> 04:10:26,580
Like we would overwhelm the entire
state if we just stood there.

8673
04:10:26,640 --> 04:10:28,120
And there's so many fat

8674
04:10:29,940 --> 04:10:30,660
people there too.

8675
04:10:30,660 --> 04:10:32,690
I was confused as to what
you're saying of space.

8676
04:10:32,760 --> 04:10:37,660
The land mass of taxes is
(260) 800-0820 square miles.

8677
04:10:37,661 --> 04:10:41,430
7,494,002 oh 7 billion.

8678
04:10:41,580 --> 04:10:42,031
What does that,

8679
04:10:42,031 --> 04:10:42,781
is that even billion?

8680
04:10:42,781 --> 04:10:43,021
No,

8681
04:10:43,021 --> 04:10:43,830
that's not billion.

8682
04:10:43,830 --> 04:10:45,000
What does that trillion,

8683
04:10:45,240 --> 04:10:46,230
7 trillion,

8684
04:10:46,980 --> 04:10:50,280
494 billion.

8685
04:10:50,281 --> 04:10:51,810
271 million.

8686
04:10:51,811 --> 04:10:53,850
488,000 square feet.

8687
04:10:55,050 --> 04:10:55,883
Whoa.

8688
04:10:57,810 --> 04:10:58,643
Interesting.

8689
04:10:59,370 --> 04:11:02,340
So no close but not,

8690
04:11:02,580 --> 04:11:03,413
not quiet.

8691
04:11:04,500 --> 04:11:06,000
That's a lot of fucking people,

8692
04:11:06,001 --> 04:11:06,834
man.

8693
04:11:07,190 --> 04:11:08,580
Got To feed all those folks.

8694
04:11:09,150 --> 04:11:13,020
They all need food and
water and a place to shit.

8695
04:11:14,100 --> 04:11:18,300
You know he used the rest of the
continental United States for funding.

8696
04:11:18,990 --> 04:11:19,823
Yeah.

8697
04:11:19,890 --> 04:11:22,510
So everybody's just standing and
then they go out to the garden.

8698
04:11:22,530 --> 04:11:23,770
They come back and stand.

8699
04:11:23,920 --> 04:11:25,470
They go out and they shit.

8700
04:11:25,471 --> 04:11:26,610
And the whole of death.

8701
04:11:27,120 --> 04:11:28,290
I'm going to go back and stand.

8702
04:11:28,410 --> 04:11:28,521
It.

8703
04:11:28,521 --> 04:11:29,261
Just have like a,

8704
04:11:29,261 --> 04:11:31,290
a pipe that runs through.

8705
04:11:31,500 --> 04:11:36,500
Everybody has their all 7 billion
plus shitting into this one tube.

8706
04:11:37,730 --> 04:11:39,290
Uh,

8707
04:11:40,180 --> 04:11:42,780
out of that attitude mixes with our

8708
04:11:44,670 --> 04:11:46,310
terrible pollution shit.

8709
04:11:46,311 --> 04:11:47,250
Monster was born,

8710
04:11:48,060 --> 04:11:48,870
crawls out,

8711
04:11:48,870 --> 04:11:49,770
kills us all.

8712
04:11:50,580 --> 04:11:51,413
That's a,

8713
04:11:51,600 --> 04:11:53,200
ironically that's what did end.

8714
04:11:53,201 --> 04:11:53,521
There you go.

8715
04:11:53,521 --> 04:11:54,354
It's on.

8716
04:11:55,170 --> 04:11:59,520
That's one of the things that did in a
lot of civilizations is their hygiene.

8717
04:12:00,050 --> 04:12:00,630
You know,

8718
04:12:00,630 --> 04:12:05,630
a lot of civilizations had serious
problems with their sewage,

8719
04:12:06,570 --> 04:12:10,650
like figuring out how to get their shit
away from everything that's going on in

8720
04:12:10,651 --> 04:12:11,260
India,

8721
04:12:11,260 --> 04:12:11,770
isn't it?

8722
04:12:11,770 --> 04:12:12,070
I think

8723
04:12:12,070 --> 04:12:12,281
so,

8724
04:12:12,281 --> 04:12:13,114
yeah

8725
04:12:15,190 --> 04:12:15,521
man,

8726
04:12:15,521 --> 04:12:19,390
I couldn't imagine living in a
place where you could probably,

8727
04:12:19,391 --> 04:12:24,100
I mean like is it like Mumbai or placed
at cities like that when you're not in,

8728
04:12:25,690 --> 04:12:27,100
I mean I guess when you're out where,

8729
04:12:27,101 --> 04:12:30,340
where some of the poor people
of that country or city live,

8730
04:12:31,210 --> 04:12:34,870
they don't have indoor plumbing or no,

8731
04:12:34,871 --> 04:12:37,270
there's people that are living
in really poor for sure.

8732
04:12:37,271 --> 04:12:38,710
And that's just one part of the world,

8733
04:12:38,711 --> 04:12:39,310
right?

8734
04:12:39,310 --> 04:12:43,540
I think it'd be pretty humbling if any
of us ever went there and spent some time

8735
04:12:43,541 --> 04:12:43,980
there.

8736
04:12:43,980 --> 04:12:46,900
So I was thinking about this
the other day when I saw,

8737
04:12:46,960 --> 04:12:49,630
I saw some some relief aid going to Haiti,

8738
04:12:49,990 --> 04:12:50,470
right?

8739
04:12:50,470 --> 04:12:51,190
And it's like,

8740
04:12:51,190 --> 04:12:52,023
yeah,

8741
04:12:52,990 --> 04:12:54,700
something bad just happened there.

8742
04:12:54,910 --> 04:12:55,743
But

8743
04:12:57,090 --> 04:13:01,180
there are places that are in that same
situation without something bad happening

8744
04:13:01,181 --> 04:13:02,890
and there isn't really
no aid going to them.

8745
04:13:02,891 --> 04:13:05,770
Like is it only a good good
thing to help people when,

8746
04:13:06,220 --> 04:13:06,881
when an ad,

8747
04:13:06,881 --> 04:13:08,020
a tragedy happens?

8748
04:13:08,050 --> 04:13:08,291
If,

8749
04:13:08,291 --> 04:13:08,501
if,

8750
04:13:08,501 --> 04:13:10,890
if the capability is still there too.

8751
04:13:10,900 --> 04:13:11,733
Good point.

8752
04:13:11,920 --> 04:13:12,850
It's a really good point.

8753
04:13:13,860 --> 04:13:14,710
It's a very good point.

8754
04:13:15,220 --> 04:13:15,490
Yeah.

8755
04:13:15,490 --> 04:13:19,420
It seems like people wait until everything
goes terrible for this step in to

8756
04:13:19,421 --> 04:13:21,280
help with those people.

8757
04:13:21,281 --> 04:13:21,701
I mean,

8758
04:13:21,701 --> 04:13:24,190
they were still suffering from a
hurricane a couple of years ago.

8759
04:13:24,850 --> 04:13:25,683
Yeah.

8760
04:13:26,320 --> 04:13:27,153
You know,

8761
04:13:28,840 --> 04:13:32,230
it's almost like we're getting
close to the point where,

8762
04:13:32,740 --> 04:13:32,950
you know,

8763
04:13:32,950 --> 04:13:35,230
when you see all these go
fund me's and all these,

8764
04:13:35,231 --> 04:13:35,501
uh,

8765
04:13:35,501 --> 04:13:35,890
these,

8766
04:13:35,890 --> 04:13:37,090
these campaigns like that,

8767
04:13:37,840 --> 04:13:42,840
it seems like if someone had figured out
a way to attach a purchasing app like

8768
04:13:45,520 --> 04:13:50,520
amazon.com or something like that and
attach an option to donate to specific

8769
04:13:52,691 --> 04:13:53,380
charities,

8770
04:13:53,380 --> 04:13:56,020
like you could set that up and
they would just rounded off.

8771
04:13:56,230 --> 04:13:58,570
Like say if you're buying
something that's $3 and 50 cents,

8772
04:13:58,571 --> 04:14:01,510
I rounded off to $4 and
just do that with everybody.

8773
04:14:01,990 --> 04:14:04,030
And no matter what it would be,

8774
04:14:04,031 --> 04:14:06,970
it would round up to the next dollar.

8775
04:14:07,300 --> 04:14:10,120
And you just take all that
money from all these purchases.

8776
04:14:10,150 --> 04:14:14,110
When thinking about how many millions
of dollars a day must be generated by a

8777
04:14:14,111 --> 04:14:19,111
purchasing APP like amazon.com and if
you just rounded off to the next dollar

8778
04:14:19,210 --> 04:14:20,740
and donated all that money,

8779
04:14:21,100 --> 04:14:23,860
think about how much
crazy shit could get done.

8780
04:14:24,610 --> 04:14:25,120
I mean,

8781
04:14:25,120 --> 04:14:26,800
the sheer amount of,

8782
04:14:26,801 --> 04:14:28,060
if everybody agreed to do that,

8783
04:14:28,061 --> 04:14:28,211
look,

8784
04:14:28,211 --> 04:14:29,350
everybody hates penny's.

8785
04:14:29,530 --> 04:14:30,460
Fuck Nichols.

8786
04:14:30,670 --> 04:14:32,320
I don't like Nichols
and none in the dimes.

8787
04:14:32,321 --> 04:14:32,870
I though those are,

8788
04:14:32,870 --> 04:14:33,611
they're annoying.

8789
04:14:33,611 --> 04:14:34,870
They click around in your pocket,

8790
04:14:34,871 --> 04:14:36,580
you can't really buy shit with them.

8791
04:14:36,820 --> 04:14:37,653
Right.

8792
04:14:38,220 --> 04:14:39,640
It rounded off,

8793
04:14:40,030 --> 04:14:40,960
round it all off,

8794
04:14:40,990 --> 04:14:41,830
round everything off.

8795
04:14:41,831 --> 04:14:44,080
If we all just agreed as a society,

8796
04:14:44,320 --> 04:14:46,000
then when no matter what the money is,

8797
04:14:46,510 --> 04:14:51,510
it's $4 and 64 cents around that bitch
off to five bucks and that money goes

8798
04:14:51,551 --> 04:14:54,160
into the be a good human pool.

8799
04:14:55,510 --> 04:14:57,310
How many orders does Amazon get per day?

8800
04:14:57,580 --> 04:15:00,430
36.8 million items.

8801
04:15:02,150 --> 04:15:02,500
Yeah,

8802
04:15:02,500 --> 04:15:03,101
but there isn't,

8803
04:15:03,101 --> 04:15:05,050
I mean there are some people that uh,

8804
04:15:05,120 --> 04:15:10,120
that or if they're thing
costs $3 and 17 cents,

8805
04:15:11,540 --> 04:15:16,140
that 87 that 83 cents means a lot to
them and they don't want to give it a go.

8806
04:15:16,810 --> 04:15:17,541
They've got to wake up,

8807
04:15:17,541 --> 04:15:18,470
we're all in this together.

8808
04:15:18,680 --> 04:15:20,480
If you can afford to
buy that new toothbrush,

8809
04:15:20,570 --> 04:15:22,790
electric toothbrush with
the Darth Vader sound,

8810
04:15:23,530 --> 04:15:26,810
you could afford to give that extra
30 cents to those kids in Bangladesh.

8811
04:15:27,680 --> 04:15:29,480
It's only we're talking pennies here.

8812
04:15:29,550 --> 04:15:30,770
We're literally talking sense.

8813
04:15:30,771 --> 04:15:33,290
I don't think they'll sense do
mean a lot to the individual,

8814
04:15:33,380 --> 04:15:34,940
but I think they mean a lot collectively.

8815
04:15:34,941 --> 04:15:37,670
I think when you're looking
at millions of orders,

8816
04:15:38,030 --> 04:15:40,550
that could be an insane force of good.

8817
04:15:40,551 --> 04:15:40,931
Like if,

8818
04:15:40,931 --> 04:15:43,790
if Amazon wanted to get
people to love them again,

8819
04:15:44,450 --> 04:15:45,890
cause sometimes people
like to hear about it.

8820
04:15:45,891 --> 04:15:48,440
Like the people that work at
Amazon apparently is like,

8821
04:15:48,560 --> 04:15:49,460
it's insane.

8822
04:15:49,520 --> 04:15:51,050
Like if you're working in the factory,

8823
04:15:51,290 --> 04:15:53,960
you've got like a timer that
goes off when someone's,

8824
04:15:54,080 --> 04:15:55,310
when someone's order gets placed.

8825
04:15:55,310 --> 04:15:56,390
Do you have like a clipboard,

8826
04:15:56,570 --> 04:15:59,570
like one of those iPad things and there's
like some sort of a timer on it and

8827
04:15:59,571 --> 04:16:03,320
you've got to run to where the item is
and get it and get it in a box quickly.

8828
04:16:03,321 --> 04:16:04,154
Like it's,

8829
04:16:04,230 --> 04:16:06,590
it's like super tight ship.

8830
04:16:06,591 --> 04:16:07,460
They run over there,

8831
04:16:08,960 --> 04:16:10,130
they get everybody to love him again.

8832
04:16:10,690 --> 04:16:14,240
It sounds like something you'd see
that a company like that would have

8833
04:16:14,270 --> 04:16:15,103
automated.

8834
04:16:15,350 --> 04:16:20,350
So like somebody places and no one in it
is the robot goes and grabs it and no,

8835
04:16:20,960 --> 04:16:21,141
no.

8836
04:16:21,141 --> 04:16:22,250
You've got to go get stuff.

8837
04:16:22,650 --> 04:16:23,570
Does people have written,

8838
04:16:23,600 --> 04:16:25,040
I mean maybe some of it's automated,

8839
04:16:25,310 --> 04:16:26,143
but I know that people

8840
04:16:27,880 --> 04:16:31,550
like a big claw arms they
want to do with drones.

8841
04:16:32,480 --> 04:16:32,870
Really?

8842
04:16:32,870 --> 04:16:33,051
Yeah.

8843
04:16:33,051 --> 04:16:35,270
They want to sell you shit
drone wrong mail shit.

8844
04:16:35,280 --> 04:16:36,113
Yeah.

8845
04:16:36,500 --> 04:16:37,370
How about them apples?

8846
04:16:38,240 --> 04:16:38,520
Yeah.

8847
04:16:38,520 --> 04:16:40,220
She'll be at your house
with a fucking Ufo.

8848
04:16:40,340 --> 04:16:40,851
It's Karen,

8849
04:16:40,851 --> 04:16:41,450
your new boots.

8850
04:16:41,450 --> 04:16:41,701
How,

8851
04:16:41,701 --> 04:16:42,534
how,

8852
04:16:43,760 --> 04:16:46,490
how many people would wait
with rifle hunting rifles?

8853
04:16:46,491 --> 04:16:48,320
It just die.

8854
04:16:48,930 --> 04:16:49,310
Just,

8855
04:16:49,310 --> 04:16:50,090
just for fun.

8856
04:16:50,090 --> 04:16:50,631
For Fuck.

8857
04:16:50,631 --> 04:16:50,901
Yeah,

8858
04:16:50,901 --> 04:16:51,501
for fun,

8859
04:16:51,501 --> 04:16:52,220
man.

8860
04:16:52,220 --> 04:16:52,831
I get free.

8861
04:16:52,831 --> 04:16:53,930
I had to get free stuff.

8862
04:16:54,200 --> 04:16:54,381
Well,

8863
04:16:54,381 --> 04:16:58,610
some people get super bummed out if
people fly drones over their head,

8864
04:16:59,570 --> 04:17:00,403
you know,

8865
04:17:00,530 --> 04:17:05,000
especially if you're a young lady and
you'd like to give the old tits a melanin

8866
04:17:05,001 --> 04:17:05,834
blast,

8867
04:17:06,200 --> 04:17:07,033
you know,

8868
04:17:07,310 --> 04:17:09,450
nobody can see and your yard and he,

8869
04:17:09,480 --> 04:17:10,430
this was a fence.

8870
04:17:10,670 --> 04:17:14,720
I'm just going to lie here
and Tan my breasts in here.

8871
04:17:17,850 --> 04:17:22,850
He'd know like every teenager with an
iPhone and fucks searching for tits,

8872
04:17:26,810 --> 04:17:29,300
especially in the warmth of the summer.

8873
04:17:29,480 --> 04:17:30,530
But I mean the warmth of the summer.

8874
04:17:30,531 --> 04:17:32,300
It was fucking 93 degrees today.

8875
04:17:32,600 --> 04:17:34,190
It was crazy hot dude.

8876
04:17:34,460 --> 04:17:36,040
This person was brought to,

8877
04:17:36,910 --> 04:17:37,260
um,

8878
04:17:37,260 --> 04:17:40,940
we're about seat cooks and awesome fight
and we haven't even talked about it.

8879
04:17:40,970 --> 04:17:42,320
Niki holds skin and uh,

8880
04:17:42,350 --> 04:17:43,720
how do you pronounce growing hearts?

8881
04:17:43,730 --> 04:17:44,780
Name Martel.

8882
04:17:45,610 --> 04:17:46,130
Martel.

8883
04:17:46,130 --> 04:17:46,461
Mirth.

8884
04:17:46,461 --> 04:17:46,950
Towel.

8885
04:17:46,950 --> 04:17:47,783
Mirthful Martha,

8886
04:17:47,830 --> 04:17:48,290
Martha,

8887
04:17:48,290 --> 04:17:50,240
Martha grown heart first fight.

8888
04:17:50,241 --> 04:17:51,360
Super close.

8889
04:17:51,600 --> 04:17:52,460
Murtha wasn't that,

8890
04:17:52,461 --> 04:17:53,270
um,

8891
04:17:53,270 --> 04:17:54,370
the lady from Sam?

8892
04:17:54,410 --> 04:17:55,030
Uh,

8893
04:17:55,030 --> 04:17:55,740
no.

8894
04:17:55,740 --> 04:17:56,020
What?

8895
04:17:56,020 --> 04:17:58,330
Who did San Fred Sanford
use the screenflow.

8896
04:17:58,640 --> 04:17:59,151
Oh,

8897
04:17:59,151 --> 04:18:00,090
Ethel was it?

8898
04:18:00,180 --> 04:18:00,591
No,

8899
04:18:00,591 --> 04:18:00,891
no,

8900
04:18:00,891 --> 04:18:01,300
no.

8901
04:18:01,300 --> 04:18:01,470
Well,

8902
04:18:01,470 --> 04:18:02,303
Elizabeth

8903
04:18:04,110 --> 04:18:04,943
honey.

8904
04:18:06,550 --> 04:18:07,500
Mirthful like what?

8905
04:18:07,501 --> 04:18:10,860
It was a time you need your people got
mad at you were shot after he knocked out

8906
04:18:10,861 --> 04:18:11,850
chuck because he did that.

8907
04:18:12,330 --> 04:18:13,163
They did.

8908
04:18:13,200 --> 04:18:13,411
Yeah.

8909
04:18:13,411 --> 04:18:14,244
People got mad at him.

8910
04:18:15,510 --> 04:18:16,343
Yeah.

8911
04:18:16,530 --> 04:18:18,390
Pershad is the nicest guy in the world.

8912
04:18:18,391 --> 04:18:19,224
Super Cool.

8913
04:18:19,260 --> 04:18:20,093
Super Cool.

8914
04:18:20,130 --> 04:18:23,160
When people would get bummed out
about him or get shitty about him,

8915
04:18:23,161 --> 04:18:23,491
I'm like,

8916
04:18:23,491 --> 04:18:23,940
what?

8917
04:18:23,940 --> 04:18:24,773
Really?

8918
04:18:25,320 --> 04:18:26,940
I feel the same way about core Mya.

8919
04:18:27,150 --> 04:18:27,811
When people,

8920
04:18:27,811 --> 04:18:28,350
uh,

8921
04:18:28,350 --> 04:18:29,370
people boo call me,

8922
04:18:29,400 --> 04:18:30,270
I'm like freely,

8923
04:18:30,830 --> 04:18:32,640
but you're not seeing what I'm seeing.

8924
04:18:33,330 --> 04:18:34,560
How could you be that guy?

8925
04:18:34,620 --> 04:18:35,453
I don't get it.

8926
04:18:36,360 --> 04:18:36,841
I don't know.

8927
04:18:36,841 --> 04:18:37,011
A,

8928
04:18:37,011 --> 04:18:38,460
I know people don't like him.

8929
04:18:39,290 --> 04:18:40,590
I don't get it.

8930
04:18:40,890 --> 04:18:41,723
I don't get it.

8931
04:18:43,570 --> 04:18:43,990
I don't get,

8932
04:18:43,990 --> 04:18:45,910
I just can't say it anymore.

8933
04:18:46,180 --> 04:18:46,751
You shop.

8934
04:18:46,751 --> 04:18:47,501
Amazon gives,

8935
04:18:47,501 --> 04:18:48,580
they already have the same thing.

8936
04:18:49,960 --> 04:18:50,531
Oh,

8937
04:18:50,531 --> 04:18:51,370
what is this?

8938
04:18:51,610 --> 04:18:56,610
Amazon donates 0.5% of the price of your
eligible Amazon smile purchases to the

8939
04:18:57,611 --> 04:19:01,570
charitable organization of your choice
and it was on smile is the same.

8940
04:19:01,571 --> 04:19:01,991
Amazon,

8941
04:19:01,991 --> 04:19:02,261
you know,

8942
04:19:02,261 --> 04:19:02,861
same product,

8943
04:19:02,861 --> 04:19:03,450
same prices,

8944
04:19:03,450 --> 04:19:04,061
same service.

8945
04:19:04,061 --> 04:19:06,340
Support your charitable
organizations by starting your

8946
04:19:06,341 --> 04:19:09,100
shopping@smiledotamazon.com oh,

8947
04:19:09,101 --> 04:19:09,934
that's cool.

8948
04:19:10,000 --> 04:19:10,833
That's nice.

8949
04:19:11,090 --> 04:19:12,280
And so you could donate to that.

8950
04:19:12,281 --> 04:19:15,400
So it has a red cross there and you
could select other the charities nature

8951
04:19:15,401 --> 04:19:18,010
conservative operation smile.

8952
04:19:18,070 --> 04:19:18,820
Nice.

8953
04:19:18,820 --> 04:19:19,930
Oh that's cool.

8954
04:19:21,190 --> 04:19:21,880
That's nice.

8955
04:19:21,880 --> 04:19:24,130
But then who is auditing those though?

8956
04:19:25,360 --> 04:19:25,871
Yeah man.

8957
04:19:25,871 --> 04:19:26,860
That's a problem.

8958
04:19:27,400 --> 04:19:28,360
That's a problem.

8959
04:19:28,480 --> 04:19:28,871
Where,

8960
04:19:28,871 --> 04:19:29,704
um,

8961
04:19:30,030 --> 04:19:30,611
we were,

8962
04:19:30,611 --> 04:19:31,150
uh,

8963
04:19:31,150 --> 04:19:32,560
going over that one podcast,

8964
04:19:32,561 --> 04:19:36,850
we're trying to figure out how much of
your actual donation goes to the charity

8965
04:19:36,851 --> 04:19:40,960
and how much goes to fees
and the people that work,

8966
04:19:40,961 --> 04:19:45,330
they're getting paid and the
rent and all the overhead,

8967
04:19:45,390 --> 04:19:46,223
all the overhead.

8968
04:19:46,930 --> 04:19:47,830
It's not a lot.

8969
04:19:48,580 --> 04:19:52,000
It's like there's a business of charity
and the people that work for those

8970
04:19:52,001 --> 04:19:52,391
charities,

8971
04:19:52,391 --> 04:19:53,224
they get paid well,

8972
04:19:53,380 --> 04:19:53,620
you know,

8973
04:19:53,620 --> 04:19:54,930
and they should keep out.

8974
04:19:55,020 --> 04:19:55,853
Is it

8975
04:19:56,480 --> 04:19:57,313
big dude?

8976
04:19:57,640 --> 04:19:58,473
Yeah.

8977
04:19:59,840 --> 04:20:00,490
Growing heart.

8978
04:20:00,490 --> 04:20:01,610
Just tag Nikki holes.

8979
04:20:01,611 --> 04:20:02,990
Come with a couple of good shots.

8980
04:20:04,130 --> 04:20:04,510
Oh,

8981
04:20:04,510 --> 04:20:05,343
Ooh,

8982
04:20:05,700 --> 04:20:05,890
good.

8983
04:20:05,890 --> 04:20:06,241
Back Up.

8984
04:20:06,241 --> 04:20:07,650
Now we're back up.

8985
04:20:12,060 --> 04:20:12,920
Ooh.

8986
04:20:13,260 --> 04:20:16,410
See this to me is so much
more interesting than boxing.

8987
04:20:16,950 --> 04:20:18,120
The way these guys are switched,

8988
04:20:18,121 --> 04:20:20,040
kicking each other and
fucking each other with this.

8989
04:20:20,160 --> 04:20:23,100
Like this is like really
technical striking all around,

8990
04:20:23,130 --> 04:20:24,180
up and down.

8991
04:20:25,610 --> 04:20:27,110
Like when you get to this level.

8992
04:20:27,740 --> 04:20:28,670
This to me is like,

8993
04:20:28,671 --> 04:20:30,200
there's so much more going on

8994
04:20:32,980 --> 04:20:36,160
and it's so much more likely
to have something going on.

8995
04:20:36,310 --> 04:20:37,690
Then it was just boxing.

8996
04:20:38,380 --> 04:20:38,790
You know?

8997
04:20:38,790 --> 04:20:40,630
There's just way more boring rounds,

8998
04:20:40,900 --> 04:20:41,531
in my opinion.

8999
04:20:41,531 --> 04:20:44,170
At least inboxing and there
isn't high level kickboxing.

9000
04:20:47,810 --> 04:20:51,290
We backup Jamie back up eve Edwards.

9001
04:20:51,500 --> 04:20:52,333
Awesome.

9002
04:20:53,810 --> 04:20:54,950
That's what he had him in trouble.

9003
04:20:55,010 --> 04:20:55,700
Yeah.

9004
04:20:55,700 --> 04:20:55,851
Yeah.

9005
04:20:55,851 --> 04:20:56,684
He tagged him.

9006
04:20:56,900 --> 04:20:57,350
He hit him.

9007
04:20:57,350 --> 04:20:58,190
He hit him there again.

9008
04:20:58,460 --> 04:21:02,600
He hit him a couple times really hard
and you could see a host can taking some

9009
04:21:02,601 --> 04:21:03,590
big deep breaths.

9010
04:21:05,950 --> 04:21:06,110
It's

9011
04:21:06,110 --> 04:21:08,140
quite a little exchange there.

9012
04:21:10,380 --> 04:21:11,460
This guy is a savage.

9013
04:21:12,660 --> 04:21:13,710
How do you say Mike Pesan.

9014
04:21:13,711 --> 04:21:14,130
Yay.

9015
04:21:14,130 --> 04:21:15,090
How do you say his last name,

9016
04:21:16,140 --> 04:21:16,351
sir?

9017
04:21:16,351 --> 04:21:19,350
All of these tough things like Mike,

9018
04:21:19,351 --> 04:21:21,780
Passenger rear passengers and year

9019
04:21:23,340 --> 04:21:23,611
boy.

9020
04:21:23,611 --> 04:21:25,230
That guy trained a bunch of savages.

9021
04:21:25,470 --> 04:21:26,303
Oh yeah,

9022
04:21:27,000 --> 04:21:27,740
like I used to.

9023
04:21:27,740 --> 04:21:27,991
I don't,

9024
04:21:27,991 --> 04:21:28,351
I don't,

9025
04:21:28,351 --> 04:21:29,184
I don't actually,

9026
04:21:29,370 --> 04:21:32,040
it's weird how he used
to bring my Melvin out.

9027
04:21:32,520 --> 04:21:32,971
Yeah,

9028
04:21:32,971 --> 04:21:33,271
Dude.

9029
04:21:33,271 --> 04:21:34,081
Like on a chain,

9030
04:21:34,081 --> 04:21:34,950
like a dog.

9031
04:21:34,980 --> 04:21:36,780
I remember that Melvin,

9032
04:21:37,360 --> 04:21:38,640
and I think that was his idea.

9033
04:21:38,880 --> 04:21:39,361
Oh yeah,

9034
04:21:39,361 --> 04:21:44,361
he was getting unchained do
Melvin was crazy back in the day.

9035
04:21:46,230 --> 04:21:50,640
I mean you talk about a guy who
live by the sword die by the sword.

9036
04:21:51,840 --> 04:21:53,540
He likes started the whole Gloria,

9037
04:21:53,580 --> 04:21:56,850
Gloria or gladiator a shorts thing.

9038
04:21:57,030 --> 04:21:57,690
Yeah.

9039
04:21:57,690 --> 04:21:58,190
Yeah.

9040
04:21:58,190 --> 04:21:59,023
Everybody does that.

9041
04:21:59,040 --> 04:22:02,190
Not every chick has that every check.

9042
04:22:02,730 --> 04:22:07,380
Well why is it that so many
Thai shorts bind up on the legs?

9043
04:22:08,100 --> 04:22:11,130
Like you always see Thai guys
like roll in their pants up,

9044
04:22:11,160 --> 04:22:12,180
roll in their shorts up.

9045
04:22:12,240 --> 04:22:16,080
I think that happens more so
like that's like their thing.

9046
04:22:16,081 --> 04:22:20,730
Cause in Thailand it's like 180 degrees
usually have like these really cheap

9047
04:22:20,731 --> 04:22:21,541
like the old ties,

9048
04:22:21,541 --> 04:22:26,541
my nylon shorts until it becomes your
habit like your take when you're pulling

9049
04:22:26,551 --> 04:22:27,780
your pants up like that all the time.

9050
04:22:27,830 --> 04:22:28,620
Oh I see.

9051
04:22:28,620 --> 04:22:31,740
But it's also like insanely
hot and humid over there

9052
04:22:33,260 --> 04:22:38,160
and then that kind of becomes like your
style is to pull your pant leg up or

9053
04:22:38,161 --> 04:22:38,994
whatever.

9054
04:22:40,710 --> 04:22:41,970
It just seems to me like,

9055
04:22:42,180 --> 04:22:43,560
particularly for MMA,

9056
04:22:43,590 --> 04:22:45,690
there's no benefit in wearing shorts.

9057
04:22:46,170 --> 04:22:50,820
I feel like tights give you way more
benefit because no one's grabbing them.

9058
04:22:51,060 --> 04:22:54,600
Like there are moments in fights were
dudes get their shorts grabbed and those

9059
04:22:54,601 --> 04:22:57,840
moments they pay off for the
guy who grabbed the shorts.

9060
04:22:58,050 --> 04:22:58,950
It's happened before.

9061
04:22:59,280 --> 04:23:01,870
Guys have gotten takedowns
they've defended takedowns to,

9062
04:23:01,871 --> 04:23:04,770
they maybe wouldn't have if
it wasn't for a short grab.

9063
04:23:05,190 --> 04:23:08,820
They've controlled positions for brief
moments with a short grab and then the

9064
04:23:08,821 --> 04:23:10,920
referee didn't see it or the
referee did see it and it said,

9065
04:23:10,921 --> 04:23:11,940
stop grabbing the shorts.

9066
04:23:12,090 --> 04:23:13,170
But they had already did it.

9067
04:23:13,710 --> 04:23:15,570
All that can be eliminated with tights.

9068
04:23:15,780 --> 04:23:18,630
But then if you wearing tight
and you get caught in a Komora,

9069
04:23:18,631 --> 04:23:20,010
how do you grab your own shorts?

9070
04:23:20,190 --> 04:23:21,023
You don't,

9071
04:23:21,440 --> 04:23:22,770
you don't go get continent.

9072
04:23:22,771 --> 04:23:23,720
Comodo don't get caught it.

9073
04:23:24,320 --> 04:23:29,190
He grabbed your Dick just
reached out and fully latch on.

9074
04:23:29,450 --> 04:23:32,160
It's still your cup and it's Myrtle,

9075
04:23:32,280 --> 04:23:32,761
myrtle.

9076
04:23:32,761 --> 04:23:33,870
Leave Mercato on,

9077
04:23:33,940 --> 04:23:34,773
on her.

9078
04:23:37,400 --> 04:23:37,790
Um,

9079
04:23:37,790 --> 04:23:38,060
that's,

9080
04:23:38,060 --> 04:23:40,130
that's the only time we're
shorts would help you though.

9081
04:23:40,131 --> 04:23:40,880
You were right.

9082
04:23:40,880 --> 04:23:42,020
Grabbing your arm to defend a,

9083
04:23:42,140 --> 04:23:43,970
or grabbing your pants to defend a Komora.

9084
04:23:44,330 --> 04:23:47,060
What's kind of weird that you can do
that you can grab your own choice.

9085
04:23:47,090 --> 04:23:47,361
Yeah.

9086
04:23:47,361 --> 04:23:48,230
What the fuck is that?

9087
04:23:48,260 --> 04:23:50,060
You can grab your own
church to defend yourself.

9088
04:23:50,090 --> 04:23:50,570
Yeah,

9089
04:23:50,570 --> 04:23:51,351
that seems weird,

9090
04:23:51,351 --> 04:23:52,184
doesn't it?

9091
04:23:52,280 --> 04:23:52,820
Nope.

9092
04:23:52,820 --> 04:23:55,070
I don't think she should be able
to grab your shorts to choke a guy.

9093
04:23:55,310 --> 04:23:58,220
Like if you wrap your leg
around the guy's neck,

9094
04:23:58,430 --> 04:23:58,850
right.

9095
04:23:58,850 --> 04:24:03,040
And then you reach behind like the back
of his head and you almost like a Zeke,

9096
04:24:03,060 --> 04:24:04,160
you'll choke

9097
04:24:04,160 --> 04:24:06,950
your own pants and choke
them with your own shorts.

9098
04:24:07,190 --> 04:24:08,720
Can you do that?

9099
04:24:08,810 --> 04:24:09,260
I don't,

9100
04:24:09,260 --> 04:24:11,000
I can't imagine the position,

9101
04:24:11,001 --> 04:24:11,870
but I don't know.

9102
04:24:14,590 --> 04:24:16,760
It seems like somebody should
have come up with that already.

9103
04:24:17,150 --> 04:24:18,770
I just go and see how you get your arm,

9104
04:24:18,830 --> 04:24:19,663
I guess.

9105
04:24:20,150 --> 04:24:21,230
Well this is what I'm saying.

9106
04:24:21,260 --> 04:24:23,690
If somehow or another
you had like your leg,

9107
04:24:23,970 --> 04:24:25,040
like your thigh,

9108
04:24:25,070 --> 04:24:29,270
like right here over the guy's neck and
you went behind his head and you grabbed

9109
04:24:29,271 --> 04:24:31,820
a hold of your shorts and he
just straighten your leg out.

9110
04:24:31,821 --> 04:24:32,780
You're choking that guy out.

9111
04:24:32,781 --> 04:24:34,070
What does and what your own shorts.

9112
04:24:34,760 --> 04:24:38,040
It's like an Ezekiel choke like
one of those old school judo style.

9113
04:24:38,070 --> 04:24:40,280
Zeke you'll chokes with the collar.

9114
04:24:40,310 --> 04:24:41,600
I bet you it's legal.

9115
04:24:42,890 --> 04:24:43,400
Um,

9116
04:24:43,400 --> 04:24:48,400
I know one thing I've seen dudes do is
they finished chokes by holding onto

9117
04:24:48,561 --> 04:24:49,460
their own gloves.

9118
04:24:49,490 --> 04:24:49,880
Yeah.

9119
04:24:49,880 --> 04:24:52,040
Like they've got ahold
of a choke and they're,

9120
04:24:52,070 --> 04:24:52,690
they're literally,

9121
04:24:52,690 --> 04:24:56,840
they've got a handle like underneath
where your tape is and you can cinch up a

9122
04:24:56,841 --> 04:24:58,070
choke with that handle.

9123
04:24:58,071 --> 04:24:58,840
And it's,

9124
04:24:58,840 --> 04:25:00,110
it's very effective.

9125
04:25:00,111 --> 04:25:01,730
Is illegal because it's your own hand.

9126
04:25:01,790 --> 04:25:03,440
I don't know if it's legal still.

9127
04:25:03,470 --> 04:25:03,831
I don't know.

9128
04:25:03,831 --> 04:25:04,221
It's legal.

9129
04:25:04,221 --> 04:25:05,630
Now I should know at Slu.

9130
04:25:05,660 --> 04:25:06,493
I should know this.

9131
04:25:06,860 --> 04:25:07,630
I should know this.

9132
04:25:07,630 --> 04:25:08,110
It's fine.

9133
04:25:08,110 --> 04:25:09,810
Every neuron JBC is,

9134
04:25:09,830 --> 04:25:14,780
is it legal to choke someone in MMA
while holding onto your own glove?

9135
04:25:14,930 --> 04:25:18,040
Cause you definitely hold your
glove if you're doing a gay teen,

9136
04:25:18,050 --> 04:25:22,640
like a lot of guys do a good teen like
this and they clamp down on the glove and

9137
04:25:22,641 --> 04:25:23,331
they do it this way.

9138
04:25:23,331 --> 04:25:27,440
But I think the issue is in grabbing
inside your glove cause then it's like

9139
04:25:27,560 --> 04:25:29,390
you've got a leather handle.

9140
04:25:29,650 --> 04:25:29,781
I mean,

9141
04:25:29,781 --> 04:25:31,490
if you can get all your fingers in there.

9142
04:25:31,540 --> 04:25:32,373
Yup.

9143
04:25:32,480 --> 04:25:33,740
That's a really good grip.

9144
04:25:33,920 --> 04:25:35,040
But yeah,

9145
04:25:35,090 --> 04:25:37,040
but I still don't see
why it wouldn't be legal.

9146
04:25:37,190 --> 04:25:38,690
I guess you could get
your fingers in here.

9147
04:25:38,750 --> 04:25:39,380
Yeah,

9148
04:25:39,380 --> 04:25:40,490
you could for sure.

9149
04:25:40,491 --> 04:25:42,650
You can get your fingers in it that way
and they wouldn't even be able to see

9150
04:25:42,651 --> 04:25:42,830
it.

9151
04:25:42,830 --> 04:25:43,340
Yeah,

9152
04:25:43,340 --> 04:25:44,173
yeah,

9153
04:25:44,960 --> 04:25:45,291
yeah.

9154
04:25:45,291 --> 04:25:46,490
You could have the top of your hand.

9155
04:25:47,690 --> 04:25:48,860
It's an interesting argument,

9156
04:25:49,580 --> 04:25:49,971
you know,

9157
04:25:49,971 --> 04:25:52,010
I just don't think you should
be able to grab clothes,

9158
04:25:52,011 --> 04:25:52,580
period.

9159
04:25:52,580 --> 04:25:54,440
Like anybody you,

9160
04:25:54,740 --> 04:25:55,520
him,

9161
04:25:55,520 --> 04:25:56,450
no one grabs close.

9162
04:25:56,690 --> 04:25:57,530
Don't be grabbing clothes.

9163
04:25:57,531 --> 04:25:58,520
That'd be good to have him call his bro.

9164
04:25:58,550 --> 04:25:59,480
No clothes for.

9165
04:25:59,630 --> 04:26:00,860
We'll let them fight with a Gian.

9166
04:26:02,640 --> 04:26:05,060
Keep grabbing clothes and
everyone's gonna be fighting tights.

9167
04:26:05,510 --> 04:26:05,810
Dude,

9168
04:26:05,810 --> 04:26:10,810
it was awesome back in the day to see
boys crazy with a fucking g on go in there

9169
04:26:11,691 --> 04:26:13,010
and just rap guys up.

9170
04:26:13,190 --> 04:26:14,780
Drag him down and strangle them.

9171
04:26:15,350 --> 04:26:17,030
No denying it was awesome.

9172
04:26:17,690 --> 04:26:18,530
It was different,

9173
04:26:18,560 --> 04:26:19,280
that's for sure.

9174
04:26:19,280 --> 04:26:19,851
Fuck yeah,

9175
04:26:19,851 --> 04:26:20,684
it was.

9176
04:26:21,110 --> 04:26:24,260
I liked that because back then
I was doing traditional Kung Fu.

9177
04:26:24,261 --> 04:26:28,050
So the first guy I wanted to
see when was Jason Dilution.

9178
04:26:28,250 --> 04:26:29,270
Oh yeah man.

9179
04:26:29,570 --> 04:26:33,140
Did you ever see the street fight that
they had in the Gracie Dojo war series

9180
04:26:33,470 --> 04:26:34,780
with dilution and hoists?

9181
04:26:34,800 --> 04:26:36,020
I feel like I saw that.

9182
04:26:36,190 --> 04:26:37,023
Yeah.

9183
04:26:37,040 --> 04:26:40,520
Once is grainy old VHS copy.

9184
04:26:40,940 --> 04:26:41,600
Yeah.

9185
04:26:41,600 --> 04:26:42,433
Dilu shows,

9186
04:26:42,440 --> 04:26:42,890
you know,

9187
04:26:42,890 --> 04:26:43,940
he knew how to fight.

9188
04:26:43,970 --> 04:26:47,030
He just didn't know how to
defend against Jujitsu and hoist.

9189
04:26:47,240 --> 04:26:48,073
Mangled them.

9190
04:26:48,530 --> 04:26:51,800
But then that was before the UFC was it
up and then they fought in the UFC and

9191
04:26:51,801 --> 04:26:52,850
then hoists arm barred him.

9192
04:26:53,470 --> 04:26:58,470
So he said already fought him in a
Dojo war first and just do not just

9193
04:26:58,791 --> 04:26:59,624
demolished him.

9194
04:26:59,750 --> 04:27:01,040
Do you remember the Dojo storms

9195
04:27:02,040 --> 04:27:02,873
too?

9196
04:27:03,480 --> 04:27:04,650
Those are all real.

9197
04:27:04,680 --> 04:27:05,610
Those happened.

9198
04:27:06,030 --> 04:27:07,200
Did you ever take part in Daddy?

9199
04:27:07,470 --> 04:27:09,120
I didn't take part in the Dojo storm.

9200
04:27:09,150 --> 04:27:13,380
I took part in having to deal with guys
that came over from other schools that

9201
04:27:13,381 --> 04:27:15,240
wanted it to like test themselves.

9202
04:27:15,241 --> 04:27:16,200
Like in most of them were,

9203
04:27:16,290 --> 04:27:16,891
there was a lot of them.

9204
04:27:16,891 --> 04:27:18,450
They're just delusional and crazy.

9205
04:27:19,050 --> 04:27:22,740
There's a lot of people that came to
martial arts schools seem to be nuts.

9206
04:27:22,920 --> 04:27:23,550
Yeah.

9207
04:27:23,550 --> 04:27:24,270
Yeah.

9208
04:27:24,270 --> 04:27:25,230
Did you ever see that video?

9209
04:27:25,231 --> 04:27:26,520
It's a really disturbing one.

9210
04:27:26,610 --> 04:27:30,210
We played it a couple of weeks ago
of this guy who was a karate student,

9211
04:27:30,420 --> 04:27:31,980
karate teacher and Connecticut,

9212
04:27:32,130 --> 04:27:37,080
and he was also a cop and him and his
students beat the fuck out of this

9213
04:27:37,081 --> 04:27:38,010
homeless guy.

9214
04:27:38,430 --> 04:27:41,240
Like the guy they brought the
guy in and the guy like was,

9215
04:27:41,370 --> 04:27:44,520
he was just a crazy person who was saying
he knew karate and he's thrown like

9216
04:27:44,521 --> 04:27:45,480
crazy kicks and shit.

9217
04:27:45,480 --> 04:27:48,300
And so they have like essentially
like a fight to the death.

9218
04:27:48,690 --> 04:27:49,523
The Gum?

9219
04:27:49,560 --> 04:27:50,250
Yes.

9220
04:27:50,250 --> 04:27:50,491
Yeah,

9221
04:27:50,491 --> 04:27:51,120
but like,

9222
04:27:51,120 --> 04:27:53,220
so I didn't know because I thought,

9223
04:27:53,221 --> 04:27:53,371
oh,

9224
04:27:53,371 --> 04:27:54,390
this looks ridiculous.

9225
04:27:54,391 --> 04:27:56,400
But then when the guy was
actually trying to kill him,

9226
04:27:56,401 --> 04:27:56,911
he was like,

9227
04:27:56,911 --> 04:27:59,700
do it really well with
his fucking made up shit.

9228
04:27:59,970 --> 04:28:01,080
Well the guy that,

9229
04:28:01,081 --> 04:28:02,370
he was shy as a black belt,

9230
04:28:02,400 --> 04:28:03,540
I mean this is cookbook.

9231
04:28:04,520 --> 04:28:05,920
He probably knew how to throw,

9232
04:28:06,240 --> 04:28:07,800
throw a few kicks here and there,

9233
04:28:07,801 --> 04:28:09,240
but the other guy,

9234
04:28:09,390 --> 04:28:12,420
I mean it wasn't long before he was on
his back and the other guy was stomping

9235
04:28:12,421 --> 04:28:13,254
his head.

9236
04:28:13,320 --> 04:28:13,531
I mean,

9237
04:28:13,531 --> 04:28:15,420
it wasn't like a five
minute fight or anything.

9238
04:28:15,770 --> 04:28:16,160
He,

9239
04:28:16,160 --> 04:28:18,140
he threw some flippy shit and some,

9240
04:28:18,230 --> 04:28:19,930
but eventually the guy
beat the shit out of him.

9241
04:28:20,100 --> 04:28:21,930
But the point is that like,

9242
04:28:22,110 --> 04:28:23,730
that was like a crazy person.

9243
04:28:24,870 --> 04:28:26,850
They almost beat that guy to
death when the dragging them away.

9244
04:28:26,850 --> 04:28:28,110
You see the blood from his head,

9245
04:28:28,130 --> 04:28:29,580
he like says they're dragging him away.

9246
04:28:29,610 --> 04:28:30,443
Yeah.

9247
04:28:31,230 --> 04:28:33,900
There was a lot of that going
on in martial arts schools,

9248
04:28:34,770 --> 04:28:35,450
but that seemed,

9249
04:28:35,450 --> 04:28:37,660
that was older than the nineties.

9250
04:28:38,190 --> 04:28:38,881
That was old.

9251
04:28:38,881 --> 04:28:39,900
And I think that was the 80s.

9252
04:28:39,960 --> 04:28:40,350
Yeah,

9253
04:28:40,350 --> 04:28:41,183
yeah,

9254
04:28:41,670 --> 04:28:41,821
yeah.

9255
04:28:41,821 --> 04:28:42,960
There was no MMA then.

9256
04:28:43,150 --> 04:28:43,890
Yeah.

9257
04:28:43,890 --> 04:28:44,161
But,

9258
04:28:44,161 --> 04:28:44,470
uh,

9259
04:28:44,470 --> 04:28:49,470
it was NHB but I mean there wasn't even
any B then we had Hickson in and Hickson

9260
04:28:49,710 --> 04:28:54,140
was telling us the stories of the old
[inaudible] Bray rivalries between the

9261
04:28:54,150 --> 04:28:56,570
Jujitsu guys and the loot delivery guys.

9262
04:28:56,700 --> 04:28:58,860
He would go there and
there'd be guys waiting.

9263
04:28:58,910 --> 04:29:02,130
And it is Josh Thompson
against Pat Heeley.

9264
04:29:02,190 --> 04:29:02,580
Yup.

9265
04:29:02,580 --> 04:29:03,413
Huh.

9266
04:29:03,420 --> 04:29:04,253
Yeah.

9267
04:29:04,350 --> 04:29:04,531
Yeah.

9268
04:29:04,531 --> 04:29:05,850
I remember bringing it up.

9269
04:29:07,400 --> 04:29:07,950
Um,

9270
04:29:07,950 --> 04:29:08,783
very smart,

9271
04:29:08,880 --> 04:29:11,400
smart way to seal up
the choke if it's legal.

9272
04:29:12,300 --> 04:29:13,133
Um,

9273
04:29:13,230 --> 04:29:15,570
but a Hickson was talking
about these crazy dojo wars,

9274
04:29:15,571 --> 04:29:17,130
if you ever listen to
that podcast is a fucking,

9275
04:29:17,160 --> 04:29:20,820
if somebody wants to hear a good
Jujitsu podcast from a master,

9276
04:29:20,850 --> 04:29:22,920
just having a conversation
with the master,

9277
04:29:23,200 --> 04:29:27,270
I kicks and he's not just the
master but a real pioneer,

9278
04:29:27,300 --> 04:29:28,133
you know,

9279
04:29:28,560 --> 04:29:30,120
a real pioneer of Jujitsu

9280
04:29:32,160 --> 04:29:32,971
and his anyways,

9281
04:29:32,971 --> 04:29:35,190
Dojo storm stories are fucking crazy.

9282
04:29:35,940 --> 04:29:39,240
It wasn't cron telling you he
has a video of one of this house.

9283
04:29:39,270 --> 04:29:40,103
Yeah,

9284
04:29:40,220 --> 04:29:40,560
yeah.

9285
04:29:40,560 --> 04:29:42,330
He's got the Yohji Anjo video,

9286
04:29:42,980 --> 04:29:44,220
the Eog Anjo videos.

9287
04:29:44,221 --> 04:29:48,600
Legendary because Hixon this dude
Yohji and Joe came over from Japan.

9288
04:29:48,630 --> 04:29:53,130
This is bad ass pro wrestler do to
challenge Hixon Gracie and Hixon said,

9289
04:29:53,131 --> 04:29:53,341
yeah,

9290
04:29:53,341 --> 04:29:53,641
okay,

9291
04:29:53,641 --> 04:29:54,450
we'll do this.

9292
04:29:54,450 --> 04:29:55,283
This is what we're going to do.

9293
04:29:55,350 --> 04:29:56,250
You're going to come in here,

9294
04:29:56,850 --> 04:29:57,683
I'm going to film it.

9295
04:29:58,320 --> 04:29:59,050
And uh,

9296
04:29:59,050 --> 04:30:00,430
everybody else is going to wait outside.

9297
04:30:00,520 --> 04:30:00,971
And then,

9298
04:30:00,971 --> 04:30:01,330
uh,

9299
04:30:01,330 --> 04:30:02,770
whoever's left standing,

9300
04:30:02,800 --> 04:30:03,633
they'll leave.

9301
04:30:03,790 --> 04:30:05,500
So he takes him down,

9302
04:30:05,980 --> 04:30:07,690
beats his face into the,

9303
04:30:07,720 --> 04:30:12,220
like a tomato Stu and apparently filmed
it and then they took pictures of the

9304
04:30:12,221 --> 04:30:13,540
guy after he left.

9305
04:30:13,600 --> 04:30:17,950
Like there's photos of Yohji
Angelo leaving and his face
is just a pulp in front

9306
04:30:17,951 --> 04:30:18,580
of [inaudible].

9307
04:30:18,580 --> 04:30:19,690
I seen those pictures,

9308
04:30:20,070 --> 04:30:21,520
so Hickson just beat,

9309
04:30:22,150 --> 04:30:22,983
beat him.

9310
04:30:23,040 --> 04:30:24,000
Beat Pete.

9311
04:30:24,310 --> 04:30:24,961
Do you remember this?

9312
04:30:24,961 --> 04:30:25,794
You can get them off him.

9313
04:30:25,960 --> 04:30:27,610
He's just mounted a beaten
the shit out of him.

9314
04:30:27,611 --> 04:30:29,050
And then he decided to
choke them unconscious.

9315
04:30:29,290 --> 04:30:29,951
But he tapped,

9316
04:30:29,951 --> 04:30:31,930
he taped his fists up with duct tape,

9317
04:30:32,410 --> 04:30:34,090
like Hixon on the way over there.

9318
04:30:34,180 --> 04:30:34,630
He was right.

9319
04:30:34,630 --> 04:30:36,100
He rode his bike from his house

9320
04:30:37,630 --> 04:30:38,320
and uh,

9321
04:30:38,320 --> 04:30:39,031
he wrote a test,

9322
04:30:39,031 --> 04:30:40,690
like a 10 speed there and on the way,

9323
04:30:40,691 --> 04:30:45,550
he's like fucking tape in his hands up
with duck tape and he gets out and just

9324
04:30:45,790 --> 04:30:46,623
took him to who he was.

9325
04:30:46,780 --> 04:30:49,000
He was not just the best.

9326
04:30:49,210 --> 04:30:50,043
Right?

9327
04:30:50,410 --> 04:30:52,450
And that time it was like
completely undisputed.

9328
04:30:52,600 --> 04:30:53,433
Like nobody said.

9329
04:30:53,530 --> 04:30:56,530
Well then there's Hickson and well the
other argument is that this guy's the

9330
04:30:56,531 --> 04:30:56,891
best,

9331
04:30:56,891 --> 04:30:58,000
or maybe this guy's clothes.

9332
04:30:58,540 --> 04:30:59,350
There was no argument.

9333
04:30:59,350 --> 04:31:01,060
There's Hickson and then
there was everybody else.

9334
04:31:01,240 --> 04:31:03,850
So this poor fool came over from Japan.

9335
04:31:03,851 --> 04:31:06,640
It just does completely fucked up.

9336
04:31:06,970 --> 04:31:10,720
And Hickson just beat his brains in
these brains in its strangle them.

9337
04:31:10,720 --> 04:31:13,180
And then this is what the g Hixon is.

9338
04:31:13,480 --> 04:31:14,860
He doesn't even release the tape.

9339
04:31:14,950 --> 04:31:15,221
He's like,

9340
04:31:15,221 --> 04:31:15,610
no,

9341
04:31:15,610 --> 04:31:16,960
I've totally got it every now and then,

9342
04:31:17,270 --> 04:31:18,103
but that's my,

9343
04:31:20,140 --> 04:31:20,973
that's a car.

9344
04:31:21,790 --> 04:31:22,623
That's awesome.

9345
04:31:23,890 --> 04:31:24,311
He's like,

9346
04:31:24,311 --> 04:31:25,030
Nah,

9347
04:31:25,030 --> 04:31:25,990
I like looking at it.

9348
04:31:26,050 --> 04:31:26,551
It's mine.

9349
04:31:26,551 --> 04:31:27,550
Then you,

9350
04:31:27,551 --> 04:31:28,800
they think you just confirmed it.

9351
04:31:28,801 --> 04:31:32,380
Urban Legend for me cause I feel like
I've heard pieces of that places.

9352
04:31:32,410 --> 04:31:33,243
Oh it's real.

9353
04:31:33,250 --> 04:31:34,083
It's real.

9354
04:31:34,330 --> 04:31:37,050
One of my happiest moments as a
martial artist was I had dicks.

9355
04:31:37,240 --> 04:31:41,890
I had a dinner with Hickson and his
family and crawling when he was younger.

9356
04:31:41,920 --> 04:31:42,760
Cron was like,

9357
04:31:42,761 --> 04:31:43,594
um,

9358
04:31:43,780 --> 04:31:44,950
I want to say it was 16,

9359
04:31:45,040 --> 04:31:46,720
maybe 16 or 17 at the time.

9360
04:31:46,750 --> 04:31:47,830
I think he's still in high school though.

9361
04:31:47,831 --> 04:31:49,870
I'm pretty sure Hickson was still married.

9362
04:31:50,110 --> 04:31:53,800
We had dinner and then we all went back
to Hickson's house and watch fights.

9363
04:31:54,160 --> 04:31:54,940
And uh,

9364
04:31:54,940 --> 04:31:59,410
Hickson was just analyzing positions
and talking about mistakes people are

9365
04:31:59,411 --> 04:32:04,150
making and talking about the right way
to do things and he pushes shit aside and

9366
04:32:04,151 --> 04:32:04,571
is living,

9367
04:32:04,571 --> 04:32:06,940
really pushes the coffee table aside.

9368
04:32:06,940 --> 04:32:07,690
And he's like,

9369
04:32:07,690 --> 04:32:07,860
ah,

9370
04:32:07,860 --> 04:32:08,693
I'm going to get your guard,

9371
04:32:08,980 --> 04:32:09,311
I want to,

9372
04:32:09,311 --> 04:32:10,720
I want to show you some positions.

9373
04:32:10,721 --> 04:32:12,400
And he's like talking
about positions like the,

9374
04:32:12,401 --> 04:32:12,760
you know,

9375
04:32:12,760 --> 04:32:15,730
he was talking about like mistakes
that these guys in this fight tape,

9376
04:32:15,731 --> 04:32:16,171
they were watching.

9377
04:32:16,171 --> 04:32:19,960
We're watching VHS tapes and
we're watching guys who'd
made mistakes and this is

9378
04:32:19,961 --> 04:32:23,410
what's wrong and this is why Jujitsu
is all you need when you have the best

9379
04:32:23,411 --> 04:32:24,190
Jujitsu.

9380
04:32:24,190 --> 04:32:25,030
Like he was,

9381
04:32:25,060 --> 04:32:27,490
he had this crazy,

9382
04:32:27,910 --> 04:32:31,030
crazy way of analyzing like positions,

9383
04:32:31,360 --> 04:32:31,721
you know,

9384
04:32:31,721 --> 04:32:34,660
it was really interesting to talk to them
about like everything starts neutral.

9385
04:32:34,690 --> 04:32:36,280
It's like we started in neutral position,

9386
04:32:36,700 --> 04:32:37,240
he goes,

9387
04:32:37,240 --> 04:32:38,560
but once I get to one,

9388
04:32:38,650 --> 04:32:38,981
he goes,

9389
04:32:38,981 --> 04:32:40,450
there's no going back to zero.

9390
04:32:40,990 --> 04:32:41,321
He goes,

9391
04:32:41,321 --> 04:32:46,321
I go from one and then I'll go to two
and then to three and then check me when

9392
04:32:46,640 --> 04:32:47,680
there's the way he said it was like,

9393
04:32:47,710 --> 04:32:48,730
Oh shit.

9394
04:32:49,270 --> 04:32:52,450
But it was the way said
and once I go to one,

9395
04:32:52,451 --> 04:32:54,010
we're not going back to zero.

9396
04:32:54,430 --> 04:32:55,263
It was just,

9397
04:32:56,210 --> 04:32:57,043
this is,

9398
04:32:57,050 --> 04:33:00,620
I mean this is the words of a man
who straggled many a motherfucker.

9399
04:33:00,740 --> 04:33:01,573
Yeah.

9400
04:33:02,630 --> 04:33:03,920
Once I started setting you up,

9401
04:33:03,921 --> 04:33:04,520
you're done.

9402
04:33:04,520 --> 04:33:05,060
Yeah,

9403
04:33:05,060 --> 04:33:10,060
I mean he just was so just
a terminally confident,

9404
04:33:11,090 --> 04:33:13,340
and this is when he was still
thinking about fight and fader.

9405
04:33:13,580 --> 04:33:15,560
He hadn't fought since 2000.

9406
04:33:15,830 --> 04:33:17,210
He fought in 2000.

9407
04:33:17,360 --> 04:33:21,350
He fought for knocky who was probably
one of his toughest test for knock.

9408
04:33:21,351 --> 04:33:22,760
He fractured his orbital,

9409
04:33:22,820 --> 04:33:24,340
remember that he fractured you.

9410
04:33:24,400 --> 04:33:25,570
Hixon dog action,

9411
04:33:26,150 --> 04:33:30,740
orbital with a punch and then it
wound up being for knocky on top,

9412
04:33:30,741 --> 04:33:33,140
kicking Hickson's legs on the bottom.

9413
04:33:33,560 --> 04:33:34,640
And Hickson was,

9414
04:33:34,660 --> 04:33:35,120
uh,

9415
04:33:35,120 --> 04:33:36,470
trying to uptake his legs,

9416
04:33:36,471 --> 04:33:40,070
trying to up kick his knees and then
somehow or another they had gotten to a

9417
04:33:40,071 --> 04:33:44,330
scramble and then Hicks and got his
bag and Hanks and choked him to sleep.

9418
04:33:44,660 --> 04:33:45,500
What was that event?

9419
04:33:45,560 --> 04:33:46,970
I forget the coliseum.

9420
04:33:47,000 --> 04:33:47,750
Coliseum.

9421
04:33:47,750 --> 04:33:48,501
Coliseum.

9422
04:33:48,501 --> 04:33:49,550
I used to have the poster.

9423
04:33:50,080 --> 04:33:52,190
I have a shitload of those
fucking pollsters fan.

9424
04:33:52,940 --> 04:33:53,773
But um,

9425
04:33:53,900 --> 04:33:54,141
yeah,

9426
04:33:54,141 --> 04:33:57,140
so Hixon that was his
last fight and that was,

9427
04:33:57,141 --> 04:33:57,351
you know,

9428
04:33:57,351 --> 04:33:58,370
that was a fight that everybody,

9429
04:33:58,371 --> 04:33:59,450
a lot of people had said,

9430
04:33:59,451 --> 04:34:02,690
like what would happen to Hicks
and fought a guy like Funai.

9431
04:34:02,880 --> 04:34:07,220
But he was one of the examples because
he had fought in Japan Valley Tuto ran

9432
04:34:07,221 --> 04:34:11,510
through everybody and there'd been no
one that had presented any like real

9433
04:34:11,511 --> 04:34:12,800
serious challenges to him.

9434
04:34:12,950 --> 04:34:14,150
Then he fucked a Kata,

9435
04:34:14,420 --> 04:34:15,830
ran through Takata,

9436
04:34:15,920 --> 04:34:16,460
remember that?

9437
04:34:16,460 --> 04:34:17,293
You know,

9438
04:34:17,540 --> 04:34:19,640
people forget Hickson
was in pride number one.

9439
04:34:20,780 --> 04:34:24,680
Hickson was the guy who launched
pride and it was like Krs one was,

9440
04:34:24,681 --> 04:34:25,360
do you remember that?

9441
04:34:25,360 --> 04:34:26,960
It's like Pri Keres Harris,

9442
04:34:26,961 --> 04:34:29,840
one promotion that was
the carer has pride.

9443
04:34:29,841 --> 04:34:30,890
It's k something.

9444
04:34:31,520 --> 04:34:34,940
I feel like krs sounds right
to one barely watching this.

9445
04:34:34,940 --> 04:34:37,420
Awesome fight when takes
him was fighting in pride.

9446
04:34:37,430 --> 04:34:38,101
They were called.

9447
04:34:38,101 --> 04:34:38,891
So that's the,

9448
04:34:38,891 --> 04:34:40,730
that's another thing
they need on fight pass.

9449
04:34:40,731 --> 04:34:41,990
They need to put choke on there.

9450
04:34:42,200 --> 04:34:42,801
Oh yeah,

9451
04:34:42,801 --> 04:34:43,341
no doubt.

9452
04:34:43,341 --> 04:34:44,000
Right.

9453
04:34:44,000 --> 04:34:44,860
The choke documentary,

9454
04:34:44,861 --> 04:34:47,570
is that one of the greatest martial
arts documentaries of all time?

9455
04:34:47,810 --> 04:34:48,140
No,

9456
04:34:48,140 --> 04:34:48,890
the greatest.

9457
04:34:48,890 --> 04:34:49,723
What's better?

9458
04:34:50,360 --> 04:34:50,500
Well,

9459
04:34:50,500 --> 04:34:51,333
that's the greatest.

9460
04:34:51,900 --> 04:34:52,733
It's the greatest,

9461
04:34:53,120 --> 04:34:53,953
you know,

9462
04:34:54,020 --> 04:34:56,870
details him going through
that Japan Valley Tuto crowd.

9463
04:34:57,470 --> 04:34:58,303
Dude,

9464
04:34:58,770 --> 04:34:59,471
I,

9465
04:34:59,471 --> 04:35:00,080
I,

9466
04:35:00,080 --> 04:35:02,900
when I first saw that I tried
to do that stretch and I call,

9467
04:35:02,910 --> 04:35:04,520
he was twisted like a pretzel.

9468
04:35:04,690 --> 04:35:05,480
Yeah.

9469
04:35:05,480 --> 04:35:07,160
I've been trying to do that ever since.

9470
04:35:08,180 --> 04:35:08,960
I can't do it.

9471
04:35:08,960 --> 04:35:09,051
Well,

9472
04:35:09,051 --> 04:35:10,010
he can't do it anymore either.

9473
04:35:10,011 --> 04:35:10,940
If that makes me feel better.

9474
04:35:11,390 --> 04:35:12,320
So I don't think he can.

9475
04:35:13,220 --> 04:35:16,970
He's got quite a few injuries though
from all was years of Jujitsu.

9476
04:35:17,020 --> 04:35:17,853
Yeah.

9477
04:35:18,060 --> 04:35:18,310
No,

9478
04:35:18,310 --> 04:35:19,430
nobody rides for free.

9479
04:35:20,600 --> 04:35:21,433
Yeah,

9480
04:35:21,950 --> 04:35:22,311
you got it.

9481
04:35:22,311 --> 04:35:22,791
But he was,

9482
04:35:22,791 --> 04:35:23,420
uh,

9483
04:35:23,420 --> 04:35:26,270
he was like one of the first guys to,

9484
04:35:26,870 --> 04:35:27,201
to,

9485
04:35:27,201 --> 04:35:27,380
uh,

9486
04:35:27,380 --> 04:35:28,760
incorporate yoga into his training.

9487
04:35:28,761 --> 04:35:30,260
Look at that stretch lose was doing there.

9488
04:35:34,550 --> 04:35:36,530
He was seriously into yoga.

9489
04:35:37,030 --> 04:35:39,530
He had ridiculous posture or a ridiculous,

9490
04:35:39,531 --> 04:35:40,101
our balance.

9491
04:35:40,101 --> 04:35:40,934
Rather,

9492
04:35:41,060 --> 04:35:43,430
he received that shitty
did on balance beams.

9493
04:35:43,550 --> 04:35:47,000
He would walk on one leg and then lift
his leg completely over his head and a

9494
04:35:47,001 --> 04:35:47,810
standing split.

9495
04:35:47,810 --> 04:35:48,890
Wasn't that on choke?

9496
04:35:49,380 --> 04:35:50,213
Might've been.

9497
04:35:50,630 --> 04:35:51,291
I think it wasn't,

9498
04:35:51,291 --> 04:35:52,760
it was on something else similar to it.

9499
04:35:53,570 --> 04:35:54,800
This a fucking good fight.

9500
04:35:54,801 --> 04:35:55,890
We're paying attention.

9501
04:35:57,740 --> 04:35:58,860
I have no idea who won.

9502
04:36:03,690 --> 04:36:03,841
Well,

9503
04:36:03,841 --> 04:36:04,970
I've been kind of paying attention.

9504
04:36:04,980 --> 04:36:05,740
I still can.

9505
04:36:05,740 --> 04:36:06,573
Here's one.

9506
04:36:07,200 --> 04:36:07,441
Yeah,

9507
04:36:07,441 --> 04:36:08,011
no clues,

9508
04:36:08,011 --> 04:36:08,340
right.

9509
04:36:08,340 --> 04:36:08,820
Ooh.

9510
04:36:08,820 --> 04:36:11,220
But I do now know [inaudible] story.

9511
04:36:12,510 --> 04:36:13,380
I know that now.

9512
04:36:14,190 --> 04:36:15,480
Yohji Yohji Yamamoto.

9513
04:36:15,540 --> 04:36:16,373
Yeah.

9514
04:36:16,380 --> 04:36:16,561
Yeah.

9515
04:36:16,561 --> 04:36:18,930
That's apparently a
completely legit story.

9516
04:36:21,420 --> 04:36:25,320
It's definitely legit that he did it to
him and apparently completely jet that

9517
04:36:25,321 --> 04:36:26,154
he has the tape.

9518
04:36:27,510 --> 04:36:30,600
But that's just what a gangster he
is like he could sell that tape,

9519
04:36:30,990 --> 04:36:32,250
he can make money off that tape.

9520
04:36:32,320 --> 04:36:32,910
And he's like,

9521
04:36:32,910 --> 04:36:33,270
yeah,

9522
04:36:33,270 --> 04:36:34,103
it's mine,

9523
04:36:34,920 --> 04:36:35,720
it's mine.

9524
04:36:35,720 --> 04:36:37,080
He's also the guy that like,

9525
04:36:37,081 --> 04:36:38,010
he had a price,

9526
04:36:38,280 --> 04:36:38,880
like you said,

9527
04:36:38,880 --> 04:36:39,151
look,

9528
04:36:39,151 --> 04:36:41,850
I'll fight for this amount if you
don't have that amount of not fighting.

9529
04:36:42,570 --> 04:36:43,890
And that was it.

9530
04:36:44,160 --> 04:36:46,330
I mean there was no
negotiating this discussion.

9531
04:36:46,340 --> 04:36:46,800
Yeah.

9532
04:36:46,800 --> 04:36:47,633
I mean he,

9533
04:36:47,730 --> 04:36:52,320
and a lot of ways he raised the
expectations at fighters had for purses.

9534
04:36:52,410 --> 04:36:53,243
Yeah.

9535
04:36:53,380 --> 04:36:57,690
Because he always had very high
expectations for himself and very high

9536
04:36:57,691 --> 04:36:58,530
requirements,

9537
04:36:58,740 --> 04:36:59,040
you know?

9538
04:36:59,040 --> 04:36:59,131
And,

9539
04:36:59,131 --> 04:37:01,560
and people said that he was like
pricing himself out of fights,

9540
04:37:01,950 --> 04:37:02,450
but he had just,

9541
04:37:02,450 --> 04:37:03,211
just decided,

9542
04:37:03,211 --> 04:37:04,650
I think like this is what I'm worth.

9543
04:37:04,860 --> 04:37:05,280
Right.

9544
04:37:05,280 --> 04:37:06,021
And is he there?

9545
04:37:06,021 --> 04:37:09,390
I get this or they don't want to pay me
what I'm worth so I don't fight for what

9546
04:37:09,391 --> 04:37:10,190
I'm not worth.

9547
04:37:10,190 --> 04:37:10,470
Yeah.

9548
04:37:10,470 --> 04:37:11,700
Or for less than what I'm worth.

9549
04:37:12,690 --> 04:37:13,560
Is this the main event?

9550
04:37:14,160 --> 04:37:16,770
It was doing 20 hour podcasts here.

9551
04:37:17,250 --> 04:37:21,500
What the fuck this thing start at six
30 and that was the undercard remember,

9552
04:37:21,810 --> 04:37:22,141
I know.

9553
04:37:22,141 --> 04:37:22,980
We didn't know though.

9554
04:37:24,210 --> 04:37:26,040
I thought we were here for the fights.

9555
04:37:26,370 --> 04:37:27,250
Gruen hearts.

9556
04:37:27,470 --> 04:37:28,050
Amen.

9557
04:37:28,050 --> 04:37:28,290
Yeah.

9558
04:37:28,290 --> 04:37:29,640
Greenheart growing heart.

9559
04:37:30,030 --> 04:37:31,780
Do you think you won a,

9560
04:37:32,040 --> 04:37:33,130
I think Nikki one.

9561
04:37:33,150 --> 04:37:34,560
He looked a little sharper but I didn't,

9562
04:37:34,561 --> 04:37:35,940
I wasn't paying that close attention.

9563
04:37:37,840 --> 04:37:39,030
That's a real problem isn't it?

9564
04:37:39,060 --> 04:37:39,893
Yeah.

9565
04:37:40,170 --> 04:37:41,640
Bunch of fucking blabber mouth

9566
04:37:43,250 --> 04:37:43,710
I think.

9567
04:37:43,710 --> 04:37:44,980
I think it was in a fight though.

9568
04:37:45,030 --> 04:37:46,770
I think we talked about
some important shit though.

9569
04:37:46,860 --> 04:37:47,820
I like stories.

9570
04:37:48,510 --> 04:37:49,343
Yeah,

9571
04:37:49,500 --> 04:37:50,480
I like story.

9572
04:37:52,720 --> 04:37:53,820
That's what I sounded like

9573
04:37:55,560 --> 04:37:56,440
I do to men.

9574
04:37:56,630 --> 04:37:57,463
But I did too.

9575
04:37:58,500 --> 04:37:58,741
Yeah,

9576
04:37:58,741 --> 04:38:00,410
like a Hixon Yohji on Joe's story.

9577
04:38:00,411 --> 04:38:01,110
And those are,

9578
04:38:01,110 --> 04:38:02,460
those are like legendary stories.

9579
04:38:02,461 --> 04:38:07,461
Like if you went back and you read about
the tales of me and molten Musashi and

9580
04:38:08,191 --> 04:38:09,660
is all of a sword fights.

9581
04:38:09,690 --> 04:38:10,120
Yeah.

9582
04:38:10,120 --> 04:38:10,410
You,

9583
04:38:10,410 --> 04:38:12,960
you'd want to hear about those from
someone who actually knew about them and

9584
04:38:12,961 --> 04:38:13,860
they could tell you about them.

9585
04:38:14,100 --> 04:38:14,581
Like we're,

9586
04:38:14,581 --> 04:38:17,610
we're so lucky because like obviously
it's not the same as sword fights,

9587
04:38:17,611 --> 04:38:20,700
but these crazy legendary
martial arts stories,

9588
04:38:20,790 --> 04:38:22,050
they happen in our lifetime.

9589
04:38:22,260 --> 04:38:25,470
So it's not like we're hearing about
something from the 14 hundreds we're

9590
04:38:25,471 --> 04:38:29,940
hearing about some shit that happened
and you know the year 95 yeah.

9591
04:38:30,050 --> 04:38:30,780
Kinda cool.

9592
04:38:30,780 --> 04:38:31,171
They'll know.

9593
04:38:31,171 --> 04:38:32,004
That's really cool.

9594
04:38:33,170 --> 04:38:36,630
I'm going to tell you something I
would recommend or you might like this.

9595
04:38:36,631 --> 04:38:37,464
I don't know.

9596
04:38:38,880 --> 04:38:39,713
My son,

9597
04:38:40,050 --> 04:38:42,090
he just turned 13 this summer,

9598
04:38:42,150 --> 04:38:42,510
but,

9599
04:38:42,510 --> 04:38:43,770
but two or three years ago,

9600
04:38:43,800 --> 04:38:45,430
he was like 10 or 11 we were in Austin.

9601
04:38:45,460 --> 04:38:45,841
I was like,

9602
04:38:45,841 --> 04:38:46,770
you know what Yvonne,

9603
04:38:46,800 --> 04:38:48,240
we're going to do a podcast together.

9604
04:38:48,241 --> 04:38:51,490
So we sat down and we talked for
an hour and it's just for me and,

9605
04:38:51,510 --> 04:38:52,890
and I'm going to leave it for him,

9606
04:38:53,230 --> 04:38:53,980
you know.

9607
04:38:53,980 --> 04:38:57,670
But we talked about a bunch of stuff and
it was one of the coolest conversations

9608
04:38:57,671 --> 04:38:58,504
I've ever had.

9609
04:38:58,540 --> 04:38:59,980
You should probably do
that with your girls.

9610
04:38:59,981 --> 04:39:00,790
Cause when it's,

9611
04:39:00,790 --> 04:39:01,710
when they're older and,

9612
04:39:01,720 --> 04:39:02,281
and if,

9613
04:39:02,281 --> 04:39:06,130
if you're gone when they're old
or when they're your age now,

9614
04:39:06,350 --> 04:39:06,950
right.

9615
04:39:06,950 --> 04:39:09,370
They'll have to go back and
listen to if they want to.

9616
04:39:09,550 --> 04:39:09,851
Yeah,

9617
04:39:09,851 --> 04:39:10,810
that's a good idea.

9618
04:39:11,040 --> 04:39:11,370
Yeah.

9619
04:39:11,370 --> 04:39:13,600
I have a little chat
with them on a recording.

9620
04:39:13,630 --> 04:39:14,050
Yeah,

9621
04:39:14,050 --> 04:39:14,831
that's a really good idea,

9622
04:39:14,831 --> 04:39:15,230
man.

9623
04:39:15,230 --> 04:39:16,480
I'm going to do that with my,

9624
04:39:16,481 --> 04:39:17,300
I'm going to do it with my,

9625
04:39:17,300 --> 04:39:18,040
my daughter.

9626
04:39:18,040 --> 04:39:19,150
I'm doing my mom.

9627
04:39:19,660 --> 04:39:20,510
That's a really good idea.

9628
04:39:20,810 --> 04:39:22,720
I think if my dad died when I was 12,

9629
04:39:22,760 --> 04:39:22,930
if,

9630
04:39:22,930 --> 04:39:23,500
if I,

9631
04:39:23,500 --> 04:39:23,981
if I could,

9632
04:39:23,981 --> 04:39:26,320
if I had a tape of us talking,

9633
04:39:27,490 --> 04:39:28,180
I would,

9634
04:39:28,180 --> 04:39:29,013
you know what I mean?

9635
04:39:29,290 --> 04:39:30,430
Just imagine having that.

9636
04:39:30,940 --> 04:39:31,773
Yeah.

9637
04:39:32,840 --> 04:39:33,800
Hi everybody.

9638
04:39:34,060 --> 04:39:35,680
I would recommend everybody do that.

9639
04:39:35,710 --> 04:39:37,540
Just if you have an iPhone or whatever.

9640
04:39:37,541 --> 04:39:41,560
It just talk to your kid for a bit and
we talked about so many things we were

9641
04:39:41,561 --> 04:39:42,160
talking about.

9642
04:39:42,160 --> 04:39:42,551
I was like,

9643
04:39:42,551 --> 04:39:43,810
if you could go back in time,

9644
04:39:43,811 --> 04:39:44,710
if you had a time machine,

9645
04:39:44,711 --> 04:39:45,251
what would you do?

9646
04:39:45,251 --> 04:39:45,821
Where would you go?

9647
04:39:45,821 --> 04:39:46,654
He was like,

9648
04:39:47,290 --> 04:39:49,060
I dunno what the 19 hundreds and I'm like,

9649
04:39:49,090 --> 04:39:51,040
I grew up in 1,930 [inaudible] talking to

9650
04:39:55,210 --> 04:39:55,541
kids.

9651
04:39:55,541 --> 04:39:56,540
Look at the 99.

9652
04:39:56,590 --> 04:39:57,070
He was like,

9653
04:39:57,070 --> 04:39:58,150
Oh man,

9654
04:39:58,180 --> 04:39:59,700
back in the fucking old day.

9655
04:40:01,080 --> 04:40:02,260
So like things like that.

9656
04:40:02,261 --> 04:40:06,250
I then somehow we got to
talking about my dad and um,

9657
04:40:06,460 --> 04:40:09,190
about me being a kid around
my dad and he was like,

9658
04:40:10,240 --> 04:40:11,380
if I had a time machine,

9659
04:40:11,381 --> 04:40:12,214
I would go back.

9660
04:40:12,760 --> 04:40:14,680
I would go back and meet your dad.

9661
04:40:15,070 --> 04:40:15,731
You know what I mean?

9662
04:40:15,731 --> 04:40:16,090
Right.

9663
04:40:16,090 --> 04:40:16,690
Like,

9664
04:40:16,690 --> 04:40:17,950
and that's what made me think,

9665
04:40:17,951 --> 04:40:18,161
no,

9666
04:40:18,161 --> 04:40:19,330
this is something we should do.

9667
04:40:19,331 --> 04:40:22,420
Because then if he decides he wants
kids or if he has kids or whatever,

9668
04:40:22,990 --> 04:40:24,130
if they don't meet me,

9669
04:40:24,640 --> 04:40:25,473
they'd have that.

9670
04:40:25,540 --> 04:40:26,110
Yeah.

9671
04:40:26,110 --> 04:40:27,100
If you wanted to share it.

9672
04:40:27,490 --> 04:40:27,731
No,

9673
04:40:27,731 --> 04:40:28,150
that's,

9674
04:40:28,150 --> 04:40:28,983
that's important.

9675
04:40:29,020 --> 04:40:29,680
That's a good point.

9676
04:40:29,680 --> 04:40:30,550
Oh Shit.

9677
04:40:30,580 --> 04:40:31,450
I didn't see that.

9678
04:40:31,870 --> 04:40:34,000
He spun them down and hit him
with a knee on the way down

9679
04:40:34,270 --> 04:40:37,000
or putting combinations together.

9680
04:40:39,070 --> 04:40:39,840
Wow.

9681
04:40:39,840 --> 04:40:41,900
Every time I was looking
at getting a little bit,

9682
04:40:46,720 --> 04:40:47,620
this is a crazy fight.

9683
04:40:47,621 --> 04:40:48,760
So I think,

9684
04:40:48,840 --> 04:40:49,673
uh,

9685
04:40:50,110 --> 04:40:52,960
Joseph Valtellina he's saying
that he came on too late.

9686
04:40:53,480 --> 04:40:54,313
They needed more.

9687
04:40:54,430 --> 04:40:55,263
We'll see.

9688
04:40:55,360 --> 04:40:56,020
Um,

9689
04:40:56,020 --> 04:41:00,150
Valtellina he had to stop fighting
because of a head trauma right now.

9690
04:41:00,160 --> 04:41:00,851
That's what he said.

9691
04:41:00,851 --> 04:41:01,361
And that's what I,

9692
04:41:01,361 --> 04:41:02,194
that's what I heard.

9693
04:41:02,320 --> 04:41:02,561
Yeah.

9694
04:41:02,561 --> 04:41:03,221
I said he was,

9695
04:41:03,221 --> 04:41:03,460
uh,

9696
04:41:03,460 --> 04:41:04,960
having concussion syndrome.

9697
04:41:05,680 --> 04:41:06,970
It's been pretty open about it.

9698
04:41:10,510 --> 04:41:11,081
How did he,

9699
04:41:11,081 --> 04:41:12,880
I mean he how many times
he'd been knocked down?

9700
04:41:13,720 --> 04:41:14,470
I don't know anything.

9701
04:41:14,470 --> 04:41:16,320
It's from the knock out
or just sneaky holster.

9702
04:41:16,330 --> 04:41:17,230
John stopped him.

9703
04:41:18,070 --> 04:41:21,010
Probably just shots to
the head shots absorbed.

9704
04:41:21,011 --> 04:41:21,341
Wow.

9705
04:41:21,341 --> 04:41:21,821
Nikki holds.

9706
04:41:21,821 --> 04:41:22,840
Can you got hit way more?

9707
04:41:23,650 --> 04:41:24,281
Hey shilling.

9708
04:41:24,281 --> 04:41:24,730
Do you,

9709
04:41:24,730 --> 04:41:29,290
do you know that there used
to be roommates or people
wanted to see Joe Rogan in

9710
04:41:29,291 --> 04:41:30,124
the octagon?

9711
04:41:30,130 --> 04:41:30,963
Oh my God.

9712
04:41:30,980 --> 04:41:32,610
Again was it wasn't like,

9713
04:41:32,650 --> 04:41:33,550
do you know about the room,

9714
04:41:33,551 --> 04:41:34,560
about you and and,

9715
04:41:34,561 --> 04:41:37,180
and then played Wesley Snipes?

9716
04:41:37,300 --> 04:41:37,871
Yeah.

9717
04:41:37,871 --> 04:41:38,111
Yeah.

9718
04:41:38,111 --> 04:41:39,130
I've talked about that before,

9719
04:41:39,131 --> 04:41:39,410
but that,

9720
04:41:39,410 --> 04:41:41,350
that it was actually supposed to happen.

9721
04:41:41,470 --> 04:41:41,880
Oh,

9722
04:41:41,880 --> 04:41:42,810
I didn't know that was a,

9723
04:41:42,900 --> 04:41:45,130
that wasn't just a rumor at the time.

9724
04:41:45,131 --> 04:41:45,910
I was willing to,

9725
04:41:45,910 --> 04:41:46,570
I just like,

9726
04:41:46,570 --> 04:41:48,160
I know you know what
you're trying to do it all.

9727
04:41:48,850 --> 04:41:49,241
I was like,

9728
04:41:49,241 --> 04:41:50,950
what are the odds is
going to keep me off of,

9729
04:41:51,470 --> 04:41:52,303
I just didn't,

9730
04:41:52,420 --> 04:41:55,520
I just didn't think that anybody who
didn't know any Jujitsu could learn a

9731
04:41:55,521 --> 04:41:56,130
quick,

9732
04:41:56,130 --> 04:41:56,391
I'm like,

9733
04:41:56,391 --> 04:41:57,680
I was already a brown belt by then.

9734
04:41:58,070 --> 04:41:58,401
I was just,

9735
04:41:58,401 --> 04:42:01,070
I just knew what happened when a
brown belt fights a white belt.

9736
04:42:01,100 --> 04:42:01,401
I'm like,

9737
04:42:01,401 --> 04:42:02,510
I just can't imagine,

9738
04:42:02,511 --> 04:42:04,010
and I know how to stand up.

9739
04:42:04,190 --> 04:42:07,980
And even if I wasn't
good at striking anymore,

9740
04:42:08,000 --> 04:42:09,380
like as I was when I was a kid,

9741
04:42:09,680 --> 04:42:14,680
I'm good enough to know what
to not do and where to not be.

9742
04:42:14,840 --> 04:42:17,690
And if I get ahold of someone
who doesn't know Jujitsu,

9743
04:42:17,691 --> 04:42:20,000
I'm pretty sure I'm choking
the fuck out of them.

9744
04:42:20,390 --> 04:42:21,230
And that was my thought.

9745
04:42:21,231 --> 04:42:21,501
I was like,

9746
04:42:21,501 --> 04:42:22,730
this guy really wants to do this.

9747
04:42:23,180 --> 04:42:23,540
I was like,

9748
04:42:23,540 --> 04:42:24,070
I,

9749
04:42:24,070 --> 04:42:24,800
I know he doesn't,

9750
04:42:24,800 --> 04:42:25,790
he's never wrestled.

9751
04:42:25,850 --> 04:42:28,790
He never had a competitive
martial arts match,

9752
04:42:28,791 --> 04:42:30,830
whether it's a kickboxing fight or karate,

9753
04:42:30,831 --> 04:42:31,610
fine.

9754
04:42:31,610 --> 04:42:32,030
I was like,

9755
04:42:32,030 --> 04:42:33,620
I'm going to choke the
fuck out of this guy.

9756
04:42:33,770 --> 04:42:36,200
I'm going to get ahold of him when I
was squeeze the shit out of them and

9757
04:42:36,201 --> 04:42:38,090
they're going to give me a lot of money
and he's probably not even going to get

9758
04:42:38,091 --> 04:42:38,690
hurt.

9759
04:42:38,690 --> 04:42:39,523
That's what I thought.

9760
04:42:39,740 --> 04:42:42,440
And it turned out really
what it was was just,

9761
04:42:42,860 --> 04:42:47,090
he was desperate and a real
bad situation with the IRS.

9762
04:42:47,390 --> 04:42:51,110
And so they were trying to figure
out some way to generate money.

9763
04:42:51,140 --> 04:42:52,340
And one of the ways they said,

9764
04:42:52,341 --> 04:42:52,611
look,

9765
04:42:52,611 --> 04:42:55,090
let's just see if we can come up with a,

9766
04:42:55,091 --> 04:42:56,990
a crazy paper view fight.

9767
04:42:57,020 --> 04:43:00,770
And they wanted to fight John Claude
van Damme and some paper if you fight,

9768
04:43:01,220 --> 04:43:02,510
the guy they brought it to was this guy,

9769
04:43:02,511 --> 04:43:03,710
Campbell Mclaren,

9770
04:43:03,980 --> 04:43:06,200
who was one of the original
producers of the UFC.

9771
04:43:06,201 --> 04:43:06,561
And he's like,

9772
04:43:06,561 --> 04:43:06,711
look,

9773
04:43:06,711 --> 04:43:08,600
nobody's going to pay to see you.

9774
04:43:08,630 --> 04:43:10,130
And John Claude van Damme fight.

9775
04:43:10,400 --> 04:43:11,150
I disagreed.

9776
04:43:11,150 --> 04:43:11,983
I pay for it.

9777
04:43:12,410 --> 04:43:13,191
But they said,

9778
04:43:13,191 --> 04:43:14,450
no one's going to pay for that.

9779
04:43:14,480 --> 04:43:14,721
You know,

9780
04:43:14,721 --> 04:43:18,530
you have to fight someone who's a w
I think the word he used was current.

9781
04:43:18,840 --> 04:43:19,221
So he said,

9782
04:43:19,221 --> 04:43:20,390
would you fight Joe Rogan?

9783
04:43:20,391 --> 04:43:21,590
This wouldn't fear factor was on.

9784
04:43:22,100 --> 04:43:22,491
And he said,

9785
04:43:22,491 --> 04:43:22,760
Yep,

9786
04:43:22,760 --> 04:43:23,240
I'll do it.

9787
04:43:23,240 --> 04:43:23,990
Let's do it.

9788
04:43:23,990 --> 04:43:25,160
And so they came to me and I went,

9789
04:43:25,460 --> 04:43:26,180
how much money?

9790
04:43:26,180 --> 04:43:27,230
And then they started talking.

9791
04:43:27,231 --> 04:43:27,471
I said,

9792
04:43:27,471 --> 04:43:27,980
okay.

9793
04:43:27,980 --> 04:43:28,251
I said,

9794
04:43:28,251 --> 04:43:28,611
I'll do it.

9795
04:43:28,611 --> 04:43:28,851
And they,

9796
04:43:28,851 --> 04:43:29,361
are you serious?

9797
04:43:29,361 --> 04:43:29,511
I go,

9798
04:43:29,511 --> 04:43:29,721
yeah,

9799
04:43:29,721 --> 04:43:30,290
I'll,

9800
04:43:30,290 --> 04:43:30,680
yeah,

9801
04:43:30,680 --> 04:43:31,513
I'll fight that guy.

9802
04:43:32,160 --> 04:43:32,810
I was like,

9803
04:43:32,810 --> 04:43:33,350
okay,

9804
04:43:33,350 --> 04:43:34,183
we'll see what happens.

9805
04:43:34,370 --> 04:43:35,001
And so,

9806
04:43:35,001 --> 04:43:35,300
uh,

9807
04:43:35,300 --> 04:43:37,970
then there was like a bunch
of changes to the contract.

9808
04:43:37,971 --> 04:43:38,870
It was supposed to be 50,

9809
04:43:38,871 --> 04:43:39,411
50.

9810
04:43:39,411 --> 04:43:39,951
Then it changed.

9811
04:43:39,951 --> 04:43:40,221
And I said,

9812
04:43:40,221 --> 04:43:42,020
okay to that to said whatever,

9813
04:43:42,050 --> 04:43:42,620
let's just do it.

9814
04:43:42,620 --> 04:43:43,430
Let's just do it.

9815
04:43:43,430 --> 04:43:43,701
Come on,

9816
04:43:43,701 --> 04:43:44,120
let's do it.

9817
04:43:44,120 --> 04:43:44,281
Like,

9818
04:43:44,281 --> 04:43:45,830
and I was training for for quite a while.

9819
04:43:46,160 --> 04:43:50,180
I was training for it for a couple of
months and I was fucking tired all the

9820
04:43:50,181 --> 04:43:51,014
time.

9821
04:43:51,110 --> 04:43:51,630
I was trying to,

9822
04:43:51,630 --> 04:43:53,840
with rob came in and I was doing Jujitsu,

9823
04:43:54,530 --> 04:43:55,760
so I'd be hitting pads it,

9824
04:43:55,761 --> 04:43:58,970
rob came and it's barn with
him and sparring with some
of the students and then

9825
04:43:58,971 --> 04:44:01,250
a good Jujitsu and I was fucking tired.

9826
04:44:01,251 --> 04:44:02,084
And it made me,

9827
04:44:02,510 --> 04:44:05,810
I always knew how hard it was to,

9828
04:44:05,811 --> 04:44:07,700
to be a professional MMA fighter.

9829
04:44:07,701 --> 04:44:09,350
I'd seen people work at it.

9830
04:44:09,351 --> 04:44:11,300
I'd seen guys struggle.

9831
04:44:11,301 --> 04:44:14,930
I'd seen guys like Connor hewn was
like a young guy was coming up and the

9832
04:44:15,230 --> 04:44:18,920
amateur ranks and I was seeing
him fight it out of legends.

9833
04:44:19,040 --> 04:44:20,480
So I knew the requirement of it.

9834
04:44:20,481 --> 04:44:21,150
But until you,

9835
04:44:21,150 --> 04:44:25,430
I mean the Piss ass amount of training
that I was doing in comparison to what it

9836
04:44:25,431 --> 04:44:27,100
is to fight in the UFC
or something like that.

9837
04:44:27,101 --> 04:44:29,900
And it just gave me way more of a,

9838
04:44:29,910 --> 04:44:31,340
an appreciation for just how much,

9839
04:44:31,400 --> 04:44:35,870
how much it takes out of your life because
it's not just the amount of time that

9840
04:44:35,871 --> 04:44:36,651
you're spent training.

9841
04:44:36,651 --> 04:44:41,210
It's like when you're done training your
fucking tired and you're not going to

9842
04:44:41,211 --> 04:44:44,210
get a lot of other things done and
if you do you're going to be cranky.

9843
04:44:44,510 --> 04:44:45,343
Right.

9844
04:44:45,600 --> 04:44:46,433
Any help.

9845
04:44:46,520 --> 04:44:49,980
So that was the story behind it and he
just decided not to do it apparently.

9846
04:44:49,981 --> 04:44:52,860
And when it became more obvious
that they didn't want money,

9847
04:44:52,861 --> 04:44:53,970
they wanted to put them in jail,

9848
04:44:54,240 --> 04:44:56,160
they wanted to put them in
jail and set an example.

9849
04:44:56,460 --> 04:44:59,220
I think this was all while his
court case was still going on.

9850
04:44:59,221 --> 04:45:03,360
I don't want to talk out of school cause
I don't know what the exact issue was,

9851
04:45:03,361 --> 04:45:07,560
but they want to putting them in jail
for tax evasion because he had some guy

9852
04:45:07,561 --> 04:45:12,561
who apparently was advising
him incorrectly about how
much taxes he had to pay

9853
04:45:12,600 --> 04:45:14,700
or whether or not he
had to pay taxes at all.

9854
04:45:14,701 --> 04:45:15,870
I don't know the whole story,

9855
04:45:16,530 --> 04:45:17,190
but uh,

9856
04:45:17,190 --> 04:45:18,120
that was what was going on.

9857
04:45:18,121 --> 04:45:19,440
He was just in desperation mode.

9858
04:45:20,070 --> 04:45:20,580
I thought it,

9859
04:45:20,580 --> 04:45:21,960
I always thought that was a rumor.

9860
04:45:22,200 --> 04:45:23,033
Now there was real,

9861
04:45:23,040 --> 04:45:23,461
I remember,

9862
04:45:23,461 --> 04:45:27,030
I remember you mentioning
it on a broadcast who went
because he wouldn't sign

9863
04:45:27,031 --> 04:45:29,730
the contract because it was
going on for a long time.

9864
04:45:29,731 --> 04:45:30,211
And I was like,

9865
04:45:30,211 --> 04:45:31,044
what are we doing?

9866
04:45:31,650 --> 04:45:32,160
Like am I,

9867
04:45:32,160 --> 04:45:33,780
am I doing this because if I'm doing this,

9868
04:45:33,781 --> 04:45:34,860
I'm not doing anything else.

9869
04:45:34,890 --> 04:45:36,180
Like I need to know if I'm doing this.

9870
04:45:36,780 --> 04:45:37,920
And I was training a lot then.

9871
04:45:37,950 --> 04:45:38,461
So I was like,

9872
04:45:38,461 --> 04:45:39,250
okay,

9873
04:45:39,250 --> 04:45:40,620
see now you're getting pissed.

9874
04:45:40,680 --> 04:45:43,290
Because I was getting pissed
at a certain point in time,

9875
04:45:43,291 --> 04:45:43,710
but I was,

9876
04:45:43,710 --> 04:45:44,790
that was when,

9877
04:45:44,820 --> 04:45:45,390
you know,

9878
04:45:45,390 --> 04:45:49,950
I was training Jujitsu a lot and I
was training several times a week.

9879
04:45:50,070 --> 04:45:50,580
Who knows?

9880
04:45:50,580 --> 04:45:52,950
He might have fucked
me up totally possible,

9881
04:45:53,280 --> 04:45:55,290
but I was pretty sure I
was going to choke him.

9882
04:45:55,700 --> 04:45:58,440
It was just one of those
things where it's like,

9883
04:45:58,500 --> 04:46:00,620
if it was like Michael Jai
white or something like that,

9884
04:46:00,621 --> 04:46:00,901
I'd be like,

9885
04:46:00,901 --> 04:46:01,734
fuck that.

9886
04:46:02,760 --> 04:46:03,060
You know?

9887
04:46:03,060 --> 04:46:04,530
Mario Lopez knows how to box.

9888
04:46:04,531 --> 04:46:05,364
He used to wrestle.

9889
04:46:05,490 --> 04:46:06,323
Fuck that.

9890
04:46:06,780 --> 04:46:07,740
Not Interested.

9891
04:46:08,010 --> 04:46:08,551
Some duties.

9892
04:46:08,551 --> 04:46:09,600
Never done Jujitsu.

9893
04:46:10,510 --> 04:46:11,100
Hmm.

9894
04:46:11,100 --> 04:46:14,730
We just feel like it's
only so much you can do,

9895
04:46:16,550 --> 04:46:17,610
you know like white belt,

9896
04:46:17,611 --> 04:46:18,090
Brown belt.

9897
04:46:18,090 --> 04:46:21,810
Do you remember the first time you got
mauled and in like a Jujitsu class?

9898
04:46:21,900 --> 04:46:22,733
Yeah.

9899
04:46:23,100 --> 04:46:24,090
Isn't it weird?

9900
04:46:24,540 --> 04:46:26,100
It's like the first time
you get mauled you like,

9901
04:46:26,130 --> 04:46:27,900
I had no idea someone could do that to me.

9902
04:46:27,901 --> 04:46:28,734
So easy.

9903
04:46:29,220 --> 04:46:29,431
Yeah.

9904
04:46:29,431 --> 04:46:30,290
I got choked by,

9905
04:46:30,310 --> 04:46:33,570
I was like 18 I got
choked by a 14 year old.

9906
04:46:35,400 --> 04:46:36,233
I'm serious.

9907
04:46:36,780 --> 04:46:37,613
He was like,

9908
04:46:39,690 --> 04:46:40,800
I didn't know what I was doing.

9909
04:46:40,930 --> 04:46:41,763
Course,

9910
04:46:42,360 --> 04:46:45,180
there was a kid at Carlson Gracie's
place that used to torture me.

9911
04:46:45,960 --> 04:46:50,090
I was a white belt and he was a purple
belt and he was no bigger than me who's

9912
04:46:50,100 --> 04:46:51,060
no younger than me.

9913
04:46:51,210 --> 04:46:52,230
He was like my age,

9914
04:46:52,231 --> 04:46:52,921
my size,

9915
04:46:52,921 --> 04:46:55,020
and used to just rape me.

9916
04:46:55,610 --> 04:46:55,940
It's,

9917
04:46:55,940 --> 04:46:58,830
there's just no denying that this dude,

9918
04:46:59,100 --> 04:47:00,330
if we were in a fight,

9919
04:47:00,360 --> 04:47:03,870
he would be able to choke the fucking
life out of me and I would only be able to

9920
04:47:03,871 --> 04:47:05,880
hold them off for a
certain amount of time.

9921
04:47:06,420 --> 04:47:06,900
It was just,

9922
04:47:06,900 --> 04:47:07,561
I was a white belt.

9923
04:47:07,561 --> 04:47:10,020
I didn't know what I was doing and
he wasn't nice about it either.

9924
04:47:10,320 --> 04:47:11,790
He was smash you,

9925
04:47:12,450 --> 04:47:14,840
but that guy taught me a lot of,

9926
04:47:15,030 --> 04:47:19,710
it taught me a lot because I wrestled
in high school and I'd done a lot of a

9927
04:47:19,740 --> 04:47:22,920
martial arts tournaments as far as like
taekwondo tournaments and had done some

9928
04:47:22,921 --> 04:47:27,921
of that American kickboxing and I had a
totally delusional sense of how much I

9929
04:47:28,321 --> 04:47:29,760
could keep someone off of me.

9930
04:47:30,060 --> 04:47:31,290
Like in terms of grappling.

9931
04:47:31,390 --> 04:47:31,560
Yeah.

9932
04:47:31,560 --> 04:47:32,910
I really had no idea.

9933
04:47:33,690 --> 04:47:35,370
It was just so humiliating.

9934
04:47:37,530 --> 04:47:38,363
Nobody knows.

9935
04:47:38,370 --> 04:47:38,821
Nobody knows.

9936
04:47:38,821 --> 04:47:39,450
Nobody knows.

9937
04:47:39,450 --> 04:47:41,400
They don't know any grappling,

9938
04:47:41,401 --> 04:47:41,881
striking,

9939
04:47:41,881 --> 04:47:44,400
whatever it has like this
false sense of security.

9940
04:47:45,090 --> 04:47:46,630
I had to tell that to a friend of mine.

9941
04:47:47,530 --> 04:47:49,510
I had to tell that to a friend
of mine who was a grappler.

9942
04:47:49,740 --> 04:47:52,300
I had a buddy of mine
who have really good guy,

9943
04:47:52,480 --> 04:47:53,490
his black belt in Jujitsu.

9944
04:47:53,500 --> 04:47:53,711
He's like,

9945
04:47:53,711 --> 04:47:55,690
am I taking them and may fight like,

9946
04:47:55,780 --> 04:47:56,613
okay,

9947
04:47:56,650 --> 04:47:58,230
like why are you going
to take an MMA fight?

9948
04:47:58,280 --> 04:47:58,541
He's like,

9949
04:47:58,541 --> 04:47:58,871
wow,

9950
04:47:58,871 --> 04:47:59,291
you know,

9951
04:47:59,291 --> 04:48:00,400
it's kind of a bucket list thing.

9952
04:48:00,401 --> 04:48:00,851
I want to do it.

9953
04:48:00,851 --> 04:48:00,991
I mean,

9954
04:48:00,991 --> 04:48:01,840
you're to dabble in this.

9955
04:48:01,841 --> 04:48:02,651
Are you going to compete?

9956
04:48:02,651 --> 04:48:03,484
You're going to fight.

9957
04:48:03,640 --> 04:48:06,280
Like we had these one of
these conversations like how
are you going to do this?

9958
04:48:06,640 --> 04:48:07,090
And I'm like,

9959
04:48:07,090 --> 04:48:09,550
you know what you can do to a
guy because he's a black belt.

9960
04:48:09,580 --> 04:48:09,701
Okay.

9961
04:48:09,701 --> 04:48:11,860
You know what you could do to a guy on
the ground that doesn't know what the

9962
04:48:11,861 --> 04:48:12,694
fuck he's doing.

9963
04:48:13,030 --> 04:48:16,900
Someone could do that to you
standing up and it's way worse.

9964
04:48:17,260 --> 04:48:19,440
It's way worse because
if a guy takes you down,

9965
04:48:19,480 --> 04:48:20,051
strangles you,

9966
04:48:20,051 --> 04:48:20,651
you're done.

9967
04:48:20,651 --> 04:48:21,910
You tap you like you get up,

9968
04:48:21,911 --> 04:48:22,990
your neck is a little sore,

9969
04:48:23,140 --> 04:48:24,760
you're going to be fine and go to work.

9970
04:48:24,761 --> 04:48:25,594
The next tab,

9971
04:48:25,650 --> 04:48:28,090
if eve Edwards Shins you across the Dome,

9972
04:48:28,300 --> 04:48:29,620
that's not a fun time.

9973
04:48:30,040 --> 04:48:33,730
That's not a fun time and your legs turn
into rubber and they give out from you

9974
04:48:33,731 --> 04:48:36,040
and the world's spinning and you here.

9975
04:48:41,020 --> 04:48:42,210
That's exactly right.

9976
04:48:42,520 --> 04:48:43,560
It's exactly right.

9977
04:48:43,561 --> 04:48:44,394
It's terrible.

9978
04:48:44,730 --> 04:48:46,080
It's a terrible place to be,

9979
04:48:46,380 --> 04:48:47,213
you know?

9980
04:48:47,220 --> 04:48:47,880
Yeah.

9981
04:48:47,880 --> 04:48:50,940
It's just one of those things that I
don't think people realize until they see

9982
04:48:50,941 --> 04:48:53,730
it happen or until they
do it to somebody like it.

9983
04:48:53,731 --> 04:48:56,400
Since they can't do it to somebody that
I don't think they realize that someone

9984
04:48:56,401 --> 04:48:57,234
could do it to them.

9985
04:48:58,350 --> 04:48:59,250
I think everybody,

9986
04:48:59,370 --> 04:49:02,370
everybody should at least
once every man anyway,

9987
04:49:02,490 --> 04:49:04,800
once in their lifetime here.

9988
04:49:04,801 --> 04:49:05,830
That yeah.

9989
04:49:07,400 --> 04:49:08,150
Feel it.

9990
04:49:08,150 --> 04:49:10,160
Cause that that's a
different state of play.

9991
04:49:10,680 --> 04:49:12,170
It's just like a car accident.

9992
04:49:12,200 --> 04:49:12,350
Yeah.

9993
04:49:12,350 --> 04:49:14,380
People don't realize it when
they get in the car accident.

9994
04:49:14,440 --> 04:49:16,640
It's same like buzz,

9995
04:49:17,070 --> 04:49:17,930
like when you see,

9996
04:49:17,931 --> 04:49:19,130
when you see those films,

9997
04:49:19,131 --> 04:49:20,840
if you've never experienced that,

9998
04:49:20,841 --> 04:49:24,080
when you see those films where as a
car accident or a big hit and they,

9999
04:49:24,081 --> 04:49:25,700
they do that effect,

10000
04:49:25,940 --> 04:49:27,380
just imagine all of that,

10001
04:49:27,381 --> 04:49:29,000
but inside your own head,

10002
04:49:29,180 --> 04:49:33,380
it's really just like that for about
two to three seconds as it clears up.

10003
04:49:34,280 --> 04:49:39,280
I remember when Tito Ortiz Body slammed
Evan Tanner and k Odom with a body slam.

10004
04:49:41,120 --> 04:49:41,691
I remember,

10005
04:49:41,691 --> 04:49:42,320
uh,

10006
04:49:42,320 --> 04:49:43,520
just watching that,

10007
04:49:43,640 --> 04:49:45,050
how he got the clench on him,

10008
04:49:45,230 --> 04:49:48,380
hoisted him up in the air and
just slammed him to the ground.

10009
04:49:48,800 --> 04:49:50,420
And I remember thinking like,

10010
04:49:50,750 --> 04:49:55,750
so few people understand that a guy
like Dan can just do that to you.

10011
04:49:57,080 --> 04:49:57,913
Yeah.

10012
04:49:58,320 --> 04:49:59,600
Imagine that on the street.

10013
04:49:59,840 --> 04:50:00,710
Oh my God.

10014
04:50:00,711 --> 04:50:01,940
Right in front of a Bodega.

10015
04:50:02,630 --> 04:50:04,820
Just slams you on a
fire hydrant like that.

10016
04:50:05,350 --> 04:50:05,530
Okay,

10017
04:50:05,530 --> 04:50:06,363
here it is right here.

10018
04:50:06,620 --> 04:50:07,550
He got the body clench.

10019
04:50:07,630 --> 04:50:08,550
Boom.

10020
04:50:09,440 --> 04:50:11,180
Just Kayonin with a slam.

10021
04:50:11,870 --> 04:50:14,330
That was when Tito was in his full prime.

10022
04:50:15,530 --> 04:50:15,950
I mean,

10023
04:50:15,950 --> 04:50:16,740
seeing that a,

10024
04:50:16,740 --> 04:50:17,930
it doesn't that happen more often.

10025
04:50:17,931 --> 04:50:19,400
That seems like the guys are better.

10026
04:50:20,120 --> 04:50:20,730
Yeah,

10027
04:50:20,730 --> 04:50:21,563
you

10028
04:50:22,430 --> 04:50:23,263
guys are better.

10029
04:50:23,370 --> 04:50:27,020
They're better at adjusting on the
way down to the guys are realizing the

10030
04:50:27,021 --> 04:50:29,150
consequences of that
head getting into play.

10031
04:50:29,450 --> 04:50:33,350
They're protecting themselves because
a lot of it is in the body slam.

10032
04:50:33,380 --> 04:50:34,700
You're also getting headbutted,

10033
04:50:35,200 --> 04:50:36,033
you know?

10034
04:50:36,060 --> 04:50:36,680
Hmm.

10035
04:50:36,680 --> 04:50:37,160
Did you,

10036
04:50:37,160 --> 04:50:38,780
I don't remember who it was happen.

10037
04:50:39,280 --> 04:50:43,190
It was around the turn of the Millennia,

10038
04:50:43,940 --> 04:50:44,151
um,

10039
04:50:44,151 --> 04:50:44,660
Millennia.

10040
04:50:44,660 --> 04:50:45,530
But um,

10041
04:50:45,800 --> 04:50:46,370
somebody

10042
04:50:46,370 --> 04:50:50,930
got picked up in that body body lock and
they were dumping them and they posted.

10043
04:50:51,020 --> 04:50:51,920
Do you remember this?

10044
04:50:52,450 --> 04:50:56,170
I feel like it was Jason de Lucia posted,

10045
04:50:56,180 --> 04:50:57,200
snapped his arm,

10046
04:50:57,650 --> 04:51:01,130
no posted on his foot and
it's close to on his leg.

10047
04:51:01,930 --> 04:51:02,480
Uh,

10048
04:51:02,480 --> 04:51:03,960
if somebody remembers that I,

10049
04:51:03,961 --> 04:51:04,761
if I find it,

10050
04:51:04,761 --> 04:51:05,421
I'll send it to you.

10051
04:51:05,421 --> 04:51:10,100
But I feel like somebody's got body
locked and he got picked up with that same

10052
04:51:10,101 --> 04:51:11,300
slam that Tito tried to hit with.

10053
04:51:11,301 --> 04:51:12,740
Just hit on at Hannah.

10054
04:51:13,160 --> 04:51:14,720
And as he tilted his feet,

10055
04:51:14,960 --> 04:51:16,510
let's flipped his feet over his head,

10056
04:51:16,520 --> 04:51:17,570
getting Sam this way,

10057
04:51:17,571 --> 04:51:18,404
but he reached,

10058
04:51:18,410 --> 04:51:19,520
reaches out with his leg,

10059
04:51:20,250 --> 04:51:21,230
stopped himself.

10060
04:51:22,360 --> 04:51:23,193
I want to serve.

10061
04:51:23,710 --> 04:51:24,230
Huh?

10062
04:51:24,230 --> 04:51:24,921
I can't remember.

10063
04:51:24,921 --> 04:51:27,020
I only saw it once cause I'm
not looking at that again.

10064
04:51:27,530 --> 04:51:28,363
But it was,

10065
04:51:29,390 --> 04:51:29,770
yeah,

10066
04:51:29,770 --> 04:51:30,603
it was bad.

10067
04:51:30,950 --> 04:51:32,620
It was like he's dislocated his hip,

10068
04:51:32,630 --> 04:51:33,360
which some thought,

10069
04:51:33,360 --> 04:51:33,740
Jeez,

10070
04:51:33,740 --> 04:51:35,450
I feel like it was Jason de Lucia.

10071
04:51:36,570 --> 04:51:37,670
I don't remember for sure.

10072
04:51:37,700 --> 04:51:38,840
Now that you're bringing it up,

10073
04:51:38,841 --> 04:51:40,640
I have this fucking shaky memory.

10074
04:51:40,641 --> 04:51:44,990
That might just be you introducing
a false memory into my head too.

10075
04:51:45,020 --> 04:51:46,490
They say the FBI does to people.

10076
04:51:48,620 --> 04:51:50,270
False false memories.

10077
04:51:50,330 --> 04:51:51,230
They can do that now.

10078
04:51:51,700 --> 04:51:52,521
Where are you there,

10079
04:51:52,521 --> 04:51:53,240
Joe Rogan?

10080
04:51:53,240 --> 04:51:54,400
I don't know man.

10081
04:51:54,720 --> 04:51:55,030
I know,

10082
04:51:55,030 --> 04:51:55,250
man.

10083
04:51:55,250 --> 04:51:55,851
You tell me,

10084
04:51:55,851 --> 04:51:56,684
man.

10085
04:51:56,940 --> 04:51:58,400
I'm getting fucking confused.

10086
04:51:59,470 --> 04:52:00,303
Yeah,

10087
04:52:00,440 --> 04:52:00,800
we've been,

10088
04:52:00,800 --> 04:52:02,210
we've seen a lot of people get fucked up.

10089
04:52:02,250 --> 04:52:02,900
Yeah.

10090
04:52:02,900 --> 04:52:03,733
Yeah.

10091
04:52:04,010 --> 04:52:05,120
I think about it.

10092
04:52:05,121 --> 04:52:07,240
I asked my wife one time
how many fight she's seen.

10093
04:52:07,250 --> 04:52:10,670
I can only imagine how many fights
you've seen seen a lot of fights.

10094
04:52:11,390 --> 04:52:16,390
What's interesting is you and I have
seen fights from the beginning to the,

10095
04:52:17,360 --> 04:52:19,140
obviously the most recent errors,

10096
04:52:19,170 --> 04:52:20,900
almost always the best era in every sport.

10097
04:52:20,901 --> 04:52:21,270
Right?

10098
04:52:21,270 --> 04:52:21,740
Right.

10099
04:52:21,740 --> 04:52:23,240
But this is the best era.

10100
04:52:23,300 --> 04:52:23,951
I mean the,

10101
04:52:23,951 --> 04:52:24,131
the,

10102
04:52:24,131 --> 04:52:28,130
the elite athletes of today are
probably the best of all time,

10103
04:52:28,520 --> 04:52:28,970
right?

10104
04:52:28,970 --> 04:52:29,530
Yeah.

10105
04:52:29,530 --> 04:52:29,770
I,

10106
04:52:29,770 --> 04:52:34,770
I watch watch UFC broadcasts at
home and I feel like I'm watching.

10107
04:52:36,290 --> 04:52:39,440
I didn't think I'd be watching this
on television in the capacity that I'm

10108
04:52:39,441 --> 04:52:41,180
watching it now that I can see it in now.

10109
04:52:41,180 --> 04:52:42,320
Like these guys,

10110
04:52:42,321 --> 04:52:43,370
I see the fight,

10111
04:52:43,400 --> 04:52:48,400
I see these guys into the octagon and
it's like I'm watching the NBA in the,

10112
04:52:48,840 --> 04:52:53,720
in the nineties early nineties or I'm
watching the NFL and other early in the

10113
04:52:53,720 --> 04:52:54,051
mid nineties you know,

10114
04:52:54,051 --> 04:52:55,160
it's like this is,

10115
04:52:55,190 --> 04:52:59,450
this is becoming something
that is a real sport.

10116
04:52:59,451 --> 04:52:59,661
It's,

10117
04:52:59,661 --> 04:53:03,920
it's the UFC is a league and this is a
real sport that people actually respect

10118
04:53:03,921 --> 04:53:06,320
and this is going to be
become a part of the culture.

10119
04:53:06,500 --> 04:53:06,890
You know,

10120
04:53:06,890 --> 04:53:07,461
people are going to,

10121
04:53:07,461 --> 04:53:09,650
their kids are gonna grow
up to do these things.

10122
04:53:10,130 --> 04:53:10,760
For sure.

10123
04:53:10,760 --> 04:53:11,800
I didn't think I would see.

10124
04:53:11,820 --> 04:53:12,350
I didn't,

10125
04:53:12,350 --> 04:53:15,830
I didn't expect no who expected
this at this point even,

10126
04:53:15,860 --> 04:53:16,341
I mean,

10127
04:53:16,341 --> 04:53:16,820
right.

10128
04:53:16,820 --> 04:53:17,660
I thought it was exciting.

10129
04:53:17,661 --> 04:53:18,890
I thought it was going to go somewhere,

10130
04:53:18,891 --> 04:53:20,810
but I didn't think he was
going to be this quick.

10131
04:53:21,440 --> 04:53:21,561
No,

10132
04:53:21,561 --> 04:53:22,394
you're totally right.

10133
04:53:22,880 --> 04:53:23,660
It's amazing.

10134
04:53:23,660 --> 04:53:24,021
I mean,

10135
04:53:24,021 --> 04:53:27,590
and that's because the balls or the
Fertittas cough up all that cash,

10136
04:53:27,950 --> 04:53:28,311
you know,

10137
04:53:28,311 --> 04:53:32,000
get $44 million in the hole and
sticking with it and then eventually the

10138
04:53:32,001 --> 04:53:36,080
ultimate fighter finale airs and Stephan
Bonner and Forrest Griffin put on that

10139
04:53:36,081 --> 04:53:38,450
crazy show and then it
all springs from there.

10140
04:53:38,660 --> 04:53:40,480
It's pretty incredible that you're,

10141
04:53:40,610 --> 04:53:42,530
you're looking at today,

10142
04:53:42,560 --> 04:53:42,990
you know,

10143
04:53:42,990 --> 04:53:44,010
major events on

10144
04:53:44,010 --> 04:53:44,843
Fox.

10145
04:53:45,240 --> 04:53:46,200
That's giant.

10146
04:53:46,230 --> 04:53:46,951
I mean they're huge.

10147
04:53:46,951 --> 04:53:48,480
They get millions and millions of people,

10148
04:53:48,510 --> 04:53:52,020
giant paper views and
then Connor and Rhonda,

10149
04:53:52,050 --> 04:53:56,580
these two huge stars that have sort of
transcended the sport and they become

10150
04:53:56,581 --> 04:54:01,200
these pulp pulp fiction like icons,

10151
04:54:01,201 --> 04:54:02,040
these characters,

10152
04:54:02,041 --> 04:54:04,230
he's pop fiction humans.

10153
04:54:04,620 --> 04:54:09,620
They become like something exaggerated
when when the UFC had to move,

10154
04:54:11,010 --> 04:54:13,110
when they got banned in New York,

10155
04:54:13,160 --> 04:54:14,520
I had to move the event.

10156
04:54:14,521 --> 04:54:16,640
You can look in the backstage reporting.

10157
04:54:16,660 --> 04:54:17,760
That was my first one.

10158
04:54:18,180 --> 04:54:18,601
Dothan,

10159
04:54:18,601 --> 04:54:19,081
Alabama.

10160
04:54:19,081 --> 04:54:21,060
I didn't know if I was going
to have to fly to Buffalo,

10161
04:54:21,061 --> 04:54:22,020
New York or Dothan,

10162
04:54:22,021 --> 04:54:23,550
Alabama last minute.

10163
04:54:23,551 --> 04:54:24,384
It was Dothan.

10164
04:54:24,770 --> 04:54:25,610
That's like,

10165
04:54:26,040 --> 04:54:30,510
this is just a while ago and now
it's like Madison Square Gardens.

10166
04:54:30,511 --> 04:54:30,631
Yeah.

10167
04:54:30,631 --> 04:54:31,800
That was 19 years ago.

10168
04:54:32,130 --> 04:54:34,770
Those 97 crazy.

10169
04:54:34,980 --> 04:54:35,281
Yeah.

10170
04:54:35,281 --> 04:54:39,060
Now it's in Madison Square garden with
the fucking Nadine has card of assassins

10171
04:54:39,300 --> 04:54:40,530
that's ever been put together.

10172
04:54:40,590 --> 04:54:45,590
There's no better example of the fight
game at a being at its highest level now

10173
04:54:46,771 --> 04:54:47,604
than that card.

10174
04:54:47,810 --> 04:54:48,630
Like that car.

10175
04:54:48,630 --> 04:54:48,840
I mean,

10176
04:54:48,840 --> 04:54:50,240
look at all the killers on that card.

10177
04:54:50,560 --> 04:54:52,470
It was just chaos.

10178
04:54:52,471 --> 04:54:53,011
The whole car.

10179
04:54:53,011 --> 04:54:55,530
It's just chaos from top to bottom.

10180
04:54:55,650 --> 04:54:59,010
That's a lot of guides you you can
get by without watching a fight,

10181
04:54:59,070 --> 04:55:01,410
but there's not one on
there that I don't add.

10182
04:55:02,070 --> 04:55:02,940
I want to miss.

10183
04:55:03,000 --> 04:55:03,630
Yeah,

10184
04:55:03,630 --> 04:55:03,811
no,

10185
04:55:03,811 --> 04:55:04,531
it's a nutty card.

10186
04:55:04,531 --> 04:55:09,000
It's almost like show up at a chick's
house the first time you bring diamonds

10187
04:55:09,001 --> 04:55:12,120
and roses and chocolate and champagne.

10188
04:55:12,630 --> 04:55:14,250
What the fuck you going
to do the second time?

10189
04:55:14,620 --> 04:55:15,900
Just bring your dirty deck.

10190
04:55:17,670 --> 04:55:18,270
She's like,

10191
04:55:18,270 --> 04:55:18,661
what happened?

10192
04:55:18,661 --> 04:55:19,740
All the fucking diamonds.

10193
04:55:19,741 --> 04:55:20,101
Bitch.

10194
04:55:20,101 --> 04:55:20,940
Where's the champagne?

10195
04:55:20,941 --> 04:55:23,940
Like you almost can't
make this card again.

10196
04:55:24,160 --> 04:55:24,690
Yeah.

10197
04:55:24,690 --> 04:55:25,220
This card.

10198
04:55:25,220 --> 04:55:27,420
So the next time we're
in Madison Square Garden,

10199
04:55:27,421 --> 04:55:28,111
people are going to be like,

10200
04:55:28,111 --> 04:55:32,940
what the fuck is this cat
fucking cods bullshit.

10201
04:55:33,270 --> 04:55:34,350
Last time they were here.

10202
04:55:34,351 --> 04:55:38,490
We had three title fights plus
Ramiro bashed his white men.

10203
04:55:38,490 --> 04:55:39,450
We had that guest,

10204
04:55:39,451 --> 04:55:41,370
Dillon Francis Cowboy.

10205
04:55:42,300 --> 04:55:43,470
It's going to be horrible.

10206
04:55:43,471 --> 04:55:44,640
It's going to be horrible.

10207
04:55:44,641 --> 04:55:47,370
It's going to be just like a girl that
thinks you're tired of fucking her.

10208
04:55:47,730 --> 04:55:48,031
Excuse me.

10209
04:55:48,031 --> 04:55:48,900
The same thing.

10210
04:55:48,930 --> 04:55:49,111
Oh,

10211
04:55:49,111 --> 04:55:50,490
you think you're just
going to come over now?

10212
04:55:50,491 --> 04:55:50,760
Huh?

10213
04:55:50,760 --> 04:55:51,860
You don't even have to bring diamonds.

10214
04:55:51,861 --> 04:55:53,610
Is that going to be like
a once a year thing?

10215
04:55:55,110 --> 04:55:56,350
I think Madison Square Garden,

10216
04:55:56,380 --> 04:55:58,440
we'll for sure be a once a year thing.

10217
04:55:58,710 --> 04:56:00,570
The question remains,

10218
04:56:00,690 --> 04:56:04,080
did they decide to rub it in the face
of all those corrupt cock suckers that

10219
04:56:04,081 --> 04:56:08,070
kept it out in New York for so long and
keep generating these gigantic super

10220
04:56:08,071 --> 04:56:09,600
mega cards in New York.

10221
04:56:09,690 --> 04:56:14,400
So it shows everybody the massive amount
of revenue that it brings into the

10222
04:56:14,401 --> 04:56:15,060
city,

10223
04:56:15,060 --> 04:56:17,850
not just in the actual
ticket sales itself,

10224
04:56:17,851 --> 04:56:19,860
the taxes that are generated
from the merchandise,

10225
04:56:19,861 --> 04:56:22,230
but then all the affecting businesses,

10226
04:56:22,231 --> 04:56:25,260
they're going to see a boom from
all these people that are leaving,

10227
04:56:25,261 --> 04:56:27,030
that are going to go to
bars and restaurants,

10228
04:56:27,031 --> 04:56:30,510
and they're going to see some of the
craziest shit they've ever seen in their

10229
04:56:30,511 --> 04:56:30,990
life.

10230
04:56:30,990 --> 04:56:33,120
So when people see crazy shit like that,

10231
04:56:33,121 --> 04:56:34,140
they spend a lot of money,

10232
04:56:34,141 --> 04:56:34,500
man.

10233
04:56:34,500 --> 04:56:34,740
Yeah.

10234
04:56:34,740 --> 04:56:37,590
They start drinking and
fucking eating crazy food.

10235
04:56:38,010 --> 04:56:40,290
It's going to be giant
financially for the city.

10236
04:56:40,291 --> 04:56:45,291
And if they decide to just throw a mega
tsunami card like this one once a year,

10237
04:56:45,400 --> 04:56:48,100
that would be like they've got
the other mega tsunami cards.

10238
04:56:48,101 --> 04:56:48,371
Right?

10239
04:56:48,371 --> 04:56:50,110
It's usually like the July 4th cards,

10240
04:56:50,111 --> 04:56:55,100
usually a giant one and December 31st
card is usually a giant one soup maybe.

10241
04:56:55,270 --> 04:56:55,571
Yeah.

10242
04:56:55,571 --> 04:56:57,730
Superbowl ones usually
a pretty big one too.

10243
04:56:57,940 --> 04:56:58,810
Maybe this one too.

10244
04:56:59,650 --> 04:57:02,320
But this is kind of
almost to to make a point.

10245
04:57:02,920 --> 04:57:03,400
Yeah.

10246
04:57:03,400 --> 04:57:05,740
19 you're fucking years of corruption.

10247
04:57:05,770 --> 04:57:06,730
19 years,

10248
04:57:06,940 --> 04:57:07,840
19 years.

10249
04:57:08,170 --> 04:57:09,190
It was kept out in New York.

10250
04:57:10,000 --> 04:57:11,510
It's a long time and,

10251
04:57:11,511 --> 04:57:12,090
and it's,

10252
04:57:12,090 --> 04:57:15,490
it's not like they didn't see the sport.

10253
04:57:15,530 --> 04:57:16,910
The sport wasn't broad gassing,

10254
04:57:16,930 --> 04:57:17,131
you have,

10255
04:57:17,131 --> 04:57:21,100
the split wasn't banned
from the state visually.

10256
04:57:21,100 --> 04:57:22,030
At least you know,

10257
04:57:22,031 --> 04:57:22,330
so.

10258
04:57:22,330 --> 04:57:25,630
So it wasn't like these people don't
know what they're missing the fans.

10259
04:57:25,631 --> 04:57:26,464
Anyway,

10260
04:57:27,070 --> 04:57:31,000
you started getting a homegrown group
of guys coming in behind maths area.

10261
04:57:31,001 --> 04:57:31,211
You know,

10262
04:57:31,211 --> 04:57:32,710
you get those long island and the guys,

10263
04:57:32,711 --> 04:57:33,790
you get why men's,

10264
04:57:33,791 --> 04:57:37,750
you get handle as guys and these guys
are local and they don't get to fight at

10265
04:57:37,751 --> 04:57:38,610
home because,

10266
04:57:38,800 --> 04:57:43,000
because you have a problem with something
unit corrupt and it's got millions of

10267
04:57:43,001 --> 04:57:43,834
pay per view buys.

10268
04:57:44,190 --> 04:57:44,400
Yeah.

10269
04:57:44,400 --> 04:57:49,400
So if you're putting on like whether
it's UFC 100 or UFC 200 or two oh two oh

10270
04:57:51,371 --> 04:57:55,990
one you're getting into these hundreds
of millions of people all throughout the

10271
04:57:55,991 --> 04:58:00,130
world that are watching something
that you can't have in your state.

10272
04:58:00,880 --> 04:58:02,140
Like what the fuck are you doing?

10273
04:58:02,750 --> 04:58:03,431
That's crazy.

10274
04:58:03,431 --> 04:58:04,570
It doesn't even make sense.

10275
04:58:04,690 --> 04:58:05,523
Stupid.

10276
04:58:05,830 --> 04:58:09,910
There's millions of fans all
over the world of MMA now.

10277
04:58:10,360 --> 04:58:11,380
Absolutely not.

10278
04:58:11,381 --> 04:58:12,610
I do not want your money.

10279
04:58:13,180 --> 04:58:13,540
Well,

10280
04:58:13,540 --> 04:58:15,250
it's just keeping it out for,

10281
04:58:15,730 --> 04:58:17,470
you know the whole reason
why the culinary union.

10282
04:58:17,510 --> 04:58:17,890
Yeah.

10283
04:58:17,890 --> 04:58:18,610
Allegedly,

10284
04:58:18,610 --> 04:58:23,610
allegedly until all alleged Joe
Schilling I've checked out too.

10285
04:58:24,190 --> 04:58:28,120
I'm just still talking for some reason
we just shut the fuck up and wrap this

10286
04:58:28,121 --> 04:58:28,331
up.

10287
04:58:28,331 --> 04:58:30,370
We've talked forever for the long show.

10288
04:58:30,400 --> 04:58:30,911
Eve Edwards,

10289
04:58:30,911 --> 04:58:31,721
we finally got you on,

10290
04:58:31,721 --> 04:58:33,490
but we got you on for a doozy.

10291
04:58:33,640 --> 04:58:36,760
I mean been here for the time that you've
been talking about doing this podcast

10292
04:58:36,830 --> 04:58:37,061
now.

10293
04:58:37,061 --> 04:58:39,160
We got you on for five fucking hours,

10294
04:58:39,810 --> 04:58:41,650
so it was like five two for one.

10295
04:58:42,280 --> 04:58:43,960
This is a fun glory guys.

10296
04:58:43,961 --> 04:58:45,400
It was a fun fight companion.

10297
04:58:45,401 --> 04:58:46,540
We should do these for a,

10298
04:58:46,541 --> 04:58:47,500
for some other fights.

10299
04:58:47,830 --> 04:58:52,830
Maybe for some other Moy Thai fights
or glory or something like that.

10300
04:58:52,881 --> 04:58:53,714
I was good times right.

10301
04:58:53,860 --> 04:58:54,311
Sounds good.

10302
04:58:54,311 --> 04:58:55,144
It's a good time.

10303
04:58:55,220 --> 04:58:55,640
All right.

10304
04:58:55,640 --> 04:58:56,740
I'm Joe Schilling.

10305
04:58:57,040 --> 04:58:58,600
Good luck on December 10th.

10306
04:58:58,630 --> 04:59:00,730
Don't pull out of your fight to a watch.

10307
04:59:00,731 --> 04:59:02,170
Badr Hari versus Rico.

10308
04:59:02,171 --> 04:59:05,710
Verhoeven said we fighting
them like who are you fighting?

10309
04:59:05,940 --> 04:59:06,470
Um,

10310
04:59:06,470 --> 04:59:11,020
Italian guy isn't a as so I
haven't figured out how to say it.

10311
04:59:11,021 --> 04:59:11,854
Yeah,

10312
04:59:13,240 --> 04:59:13,810
he's good.

10313
04:59:13,810 --> 04:59:14,261
He's good.

10314
04:59:14,261 --> 04:59:14,930
He's like a,

10315
04:59:14,930 --> 04:59:18,010
he's got like 60 fights are 60,

10316
04:59:18,011 --> 04:59:19,350
65 something like that.

10317
04:59:19,360 --> 04:59:22,330
It's got a ton of fights and
that's taking place in Europe.

10318
04:59:22,470 --> 04:59:22,650
Yeah.

10319
04:59:22,650 --> 04:59:23,620
It's going to be in Florence,

10320
04:59:23,621 --> 04:59:24,250
Italy.

10321
04:59:24,250 --> 04:59:25,083
Oh Wow.

10322
04:59:25,280 --> 04:59:28,660
Boxing Florence is supposed to be the
shit supposed to be beautiful over there.

10323
04:59:29,200 --> 04:59:30,130
I'm looking forward to it.

10324
04:59:30,160 --> 04:59:34,360
And then it was still on the car to
the main event is Carvallo and Melvin

10325
04:59:34,360 --> 04:59:37,080
Manhoef rematch unless
