1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,230
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,150
two live.
Mr Brown,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,270
how are you sir?
Great.

4
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:08,100
It's great to be here.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,610
I have been enjoying your latest book,
but I do have to tell you,

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,790
I think you broke my brain with gage 
symmetry.

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,850
I had to go over that about 30 or 40 
times to try to figure out what that 

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,360
means and how that works and.

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,410
Well,
it's amazing you did.

10
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,480
It breaks our brains.
I,

11
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,560
I put it in there in spite of the fact 
that it's hard.

12
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:28,560
That part is hard,
but it is so central to the way we think

13
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,680
about the world nowadays.
So I thought I got to try and explain it

14
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:32,640
and I was.
I spent,

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,850
I broke my own brain trying to think of 
ways to explain it and I figured people 

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,170
wouldn't devote as much time as you did 
to doing it is so.

17
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,710
It's so subtle that it's that many.
They'd even.

18
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:47,520
Physicists have a hard time in some ways
grasping the implications of it,

19
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:49,660
but it is so central.
The way we think about the universe.

20
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:53,840
I thought if I don't include it for the 
inquiring mind like you then,

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,950
then I feel bad.
Just so baffling.

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,790
It is.
But you know,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,280
it's one of the things that when I write
books,

24
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,330
I write,
I do most things for myself in a way 

25
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:05,330
and,
and in every book I write,

26
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,100
I usually learn something [inaudible] 
always when you're explaining stuff,

27
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:08,610
you'd suddenly.

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,060
Most teachers say the first time they 
understand that anything is when they 

29
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,461
teach it and gauge them,
you I'd never thought of really how to 

30
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:18,150
explain it.
And I tried to explain to my editor,

31
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:23,151
which was great because she didn't know 
any science and she kept not 

32
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:23,151
understanding yet.
And,

33
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:23,880
and then I came up with this 
explanation,

34
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,950
involve these chess boards,
which is still subtle,

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,340
but I realized afterwards it was kind of
neat because when I developed this 

36
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,690
explanation for gates and mature,
I not only understood it in a new way,

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,890
but I realized,
Gee,

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,560
I now understood physically.
If I'd been.

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,040
If I'd had this explanation before I 
could have predicted this higgs 

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,221
mechanism and all the things I only seen
mathematically all come out of the 

41
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:46,500
picture I gave,
so I loved that I was.

42
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,300
It's a new way for me to think about the
world that I didn't

43
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,100
before.
Well,

44
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:54,101
most of what you guys do is almost like 
another language to someone like myself 

45
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,860
and what would this seems to be.
This gauge symmetry seems to be a very 

46
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,330
complicated word in an alien language.
Yeah,

47
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,820
everything it is,
but it nevertheless it.

48
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,990
It's so central and it's.
If you can picture the fact that it's 

49
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,491
fundamental to nature and they're free.
If we really want to understand nature 

50
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,220
at some level,
you got to grapple with it.

51
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,240
You know,
it's,

52
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,120
we're stuck with the world the way it 
is.

53
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,130
It'd be great if it wasn't,
if it was a lot easier,

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:21,880
but what?

55
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,880
Because I think that's one of the more 
fascinating things about it is that it's

56
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:25,660
so bizarre.

57
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,360
Well,
yeah.

58
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:31,361
In fact,
that's why it's the greatest story ever 

59
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:33,131
told so far because it's bizarre and the
fact that it's bizarre and we've come 

60
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:35,130
this far is amazing.
It's just amazing.

61
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:40,131
We could have come this far and a few 
hundred years and it's kind of sad that 

62
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:41,640
people don't realize because they cannot
stuck it.

63
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:45,240
All this myth and superstition and the 
real world is so much more interesting.

64
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,470
It is unbelievably fascinating when you 
delve into the world of quantum 

65
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,491
mechanics and quantum physics and all 
these bizarre things that are happening 

66
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:58,860
far smaller than the eye can see.
You really realize it is kind of magic.

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,570
Well,
it seems like magic,

68
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,870
but the fact that that we get it at some
level is remarkable because with the 

69
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:11,271
other thing I find that makes it magic 
is when you realize that the world we 

70
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:14,661
experience,
it's such an illusion that the real 

71
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:14,661
world is so different.
And,

72
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,150
and I love telling the story of how we 
got there because you see scientists are

73
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:21,510
biased and prejudiced and have,
you know,

74
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,950
they,
they know where they're going,

75
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:27,951
when it's even when it's wrong and,
but science can overcome those biases 

76
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:30,060
and prejudices and drag us kicking and 
screaming in the right direction and,

77
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,220
and that's why the story is neat,
but it's also lately I've been thinking 

78
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,350
in terms of politics,
whites also need because we need that to

79
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,900
cut through the crap that we're hearing 
about in Washington that same,

80
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,120
the same scientific methods that have 
skeptical inquiry of reliance on 

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,490
empirical evidence of testing,
of looking at many sources.

82
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,280
All those things are so essential for 
the working right democracy,

83
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,430
but they're the same tools that have led
us to from just beginning to understand 

84
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,421
how balls fall when you let them go,
to understanding the inner workings of 

85
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:03,411
atoms,
Nuclei and how the universe came to be 

86
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,201
and why we're here.
I just find it's the story so wonderful 

87
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:11,030
that it's a shame.
More people don't appreciate it and the 

88
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,080
best part is the so far part to me 
because everyday the story gets better.

89
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:18,081
I'm like that other greatest story which
was written by illiterate peasants 2000 

90
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:21,120
years ago and never changes because it 
was just as boring as it is now.

91
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:24,090
And this one keeps changing and we're 
surprised every day.

92
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,340
Well,
I think one of the things that's 

93
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,301
important that you said is that 
scientists sometimes have ego problems 

94
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:32,410
and they have an idea where it's going 
even if the evidence disproves them,

95
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,620
but that science corrects it.
So I think that using that explanation 

96
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,780
or using that definition,
it sort of defines what's important 

97
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,231
about it because human beings,
even the most brilliant ones are flawed 

98
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:46,720
because we do have egos and we are just 
people.

99
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:46,750
Yeah,

100
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
exactly.
And this story that I tell,

101
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:50,350
which is for me actually,
it was,

102
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:51,940
for me it was interesting cause I really
had to learn.

103
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,970
I thought I knew the history,
but of course when you write something 

104
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:56,970
down you,
you suddenly realize you don't.

105
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,240
And I and I had to learn it more,
and you want wanna,

106
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,390
you want to take some of these people 
and shake them and say,

107
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:02,470
look,
the solutions right here,

108
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,940
you got it.
Why are you waiting 20 minutes,

109
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,860
20 years,
you're looking in the wrong direction.

110
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,790
The example I was just thinking about 
the other day and I was giving a talk.

111
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,210
I don't know if you ever saw this video 
where you're supposed to look at these 

112
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,180
people bouncing basketballs and and 
you're and you're supposed to,

113
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:21,181
I'm going to ruin it for you and all 
your listeners if they haven't a show 

114
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:24,810
where you're,
where you're supposed to count the 

115
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,251
basketballs and see many people are and 
there's a guy walking between them and 

116
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,640
an ape suit and a gorilla suit and you 
never see them,

117
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:27,990
right?

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,180
You don't even see them because you're 
so focused on the wrong thing.

119
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,400
And that's the way physics often 
happens.

120
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,730
We're focused on.
We think the direction is one direction.

121
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,850
We're so focused on it.
We don't even realize the solution is 

122
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,311
there before our very eyes.
And I think it's important because you 

123
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:44,311
know,
people think that science,

124
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,440
you know,
is that scientists and science are the 

125
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,440
same thing and they're not scientists or
ones.

126
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,330
The good thing about scientists that's 
the good scientist is they're at least 

127
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,480
willing to recognize in the end that 
they're wrong.

128
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,510
So they have these preconceptions.
And the great thing about sciences that 

129
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:00,510
trains us,
yeah,

130
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,390
there's these things,
we are central to our being,

131
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,780
but ultimately we realized we're wrong 
and were willing to change our minds.

132
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,090
That's the difference between science 
and religion really.

133
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,150
Is that.
Yeah,

134
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,040
we have biases.
Yeah.

135
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:10,640
We have prejudice.

136
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Yeah.
We want to believe we really want to 

137
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,771
believe just like the x files,
but eventually when nature tells us 

138
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:21,161
otherwise,
we throw out those beliefs like 

139
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:21,530
yesterday's newspaper.
That's why science is so neat now.

140
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:23,000
People that are listening to this and 
probably going,

141
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,530
what is gauged cemetery?
Dude,

142
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,420
you just passed over that and you said 
it was crazy.

143
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:31,421
Okay.
Is there a way that you could possibly 

144
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:31,421
just.
Well,

145
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,440
I'll give a try.
We'll see how we do.

146
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,400
Okay.
So.

147
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,640
So it turns out that that there's a 
fundamental principle in nature,

148
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:45,641
which,
which really was discovered by this 

149
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:45,641
wonderful woman mathematician,
I mean your author who was,

150
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:47,620
who wasn't even allowed to get a job if 
she would,

151
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,940
because she was a woman and the at the 
turn of the century,

152
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,450
but she discovered so there's things we 
say and we tell kids,

153
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:58,451
unfortunately schools,
energy is conserved and momentum is 

154
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:58,451
because driven.

155
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,380
It sounds like the 10 commandments like 
we come up with them because we liked 

156
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,380
them and now we understand them 
differently.

157
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,890
We understand that everything that is 
conservative doesn't change in the 

158
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,491
world,
is due to a fundamental symmetry of 

159
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,951
nature.
So energy is conserved because we now 

160
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,730
understand the laws of physics don't 
change over time.

161
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,450
So as long as you it contest that the 
laws of physics are two same tomorrow as

162
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,740
they are today,
than we know energy is concerned.

163
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:29,741
It's not something we take on faith.
It's a mathematical consequence of that 

164
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,000
momentum.
Conservation is a consequence of the 

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,791
fact that the laws of physics don't 
change from place to place that they're 

166
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:40,121
saying in this studio here as they would
be if we're having this conversation in 

167
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:43,631
New York that seems reasonable,
and she showed mathematically it's the 

168
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:44,300
case,
so there's a.

169
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,620
there's a famous,
everyone's experienced this who knows,

170
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,610
learned any physics,
conservation of charge,

171
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,990
you know the electric charge and any 
system doesn't change magically 

172
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:54,990
overtime.

173
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,450
That's a fundamental property of 
electricity and magnetism.

174
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,460
You got certain amount of charge at the 
beginning.

175
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,820
It's got to be the same at the end.
That's a consequence of the fact that 

176
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,810
it's arbitrary.
There's a symmetry of nature that says,

177
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,920
you know Benjamin Franklin called 
electrons negative,

178
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,040
negatively charged,
but it doesn't mean anything because I 

179
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,040
could have called them positively 
charged.

180
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,970
It's just an arbitrary definition.
If I changed every negative charge and 

181
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,230
the world to positive charge and every 
positive charge and negative charge,

182
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,560
everything would work the same way.
A symmetry of nature represents 

183
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,940
something.
It doesn't change about nature.

184
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,680
When you make a change in the 
definition,

185
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:35,010
so making every calling,
electrons positively charged,

186
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,030
protons negatively charged would not 
make the world difference.

187
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:41,790
It's an arbitrary name.
Martians could call electrons,

188
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:46,791
positively charged and protons.
The negatively charged is nothing 

189
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,930
fundamentally important about the word 
positive charge.

190
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,360
It doesn't mean any different than a 
negative charge.

191
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:53,720
So I could change every right now I 
could make all neck,

192
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,550
I could change the charge on every 
electron,

193
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,090
the universe and flip it is signed.
So every electron is negative.

194
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,550
Lead charged now,
but now suddenly I'm God and I make 

195
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:05,550
every electron positively charged and 
every make,

196
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,461
every proton negatively charged.
Nothing about the laws of physics will 

197
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:10,461
change.
I don't understand that.

198
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:10,980
Why would,
why wouldn't it change?

199
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:11,320
I mean,
does.

200
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,550
Is there a function of them being 
positive and negatively charged?

201
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:14,430
No,
it's just a name.

202
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,490
That's why it's so that I can call down 
and down up and it wouldn't make any 

203
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,050
noise you make with your mouth.
Yeah,

204
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,030
exactly.
So the name I give it is irrelevant.

205
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Okay.
So it's not like you would change the 

206
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,120
actual function of the electronic.
No,

207
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,820
no,
exactly.

208
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,460
I call it's,
it's electrically charged.

209
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,690
That's important.
Okay.

210
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,720
And it repels other,
other electrons because they have the 

211
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,360
same electric charge that's important.
Right?

212
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,910
To electrically negative.
Charged particles repel.

213
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,840
Right.
But look,

214
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,610
if I made the both to positive charged 
particles,

215
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:46,770
they'd also repel so,
so the.

216
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,520
So the physical consequences would not 
change at all depending upon how I named

217
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:51,420
them.
I see.

218
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:52,410
Okay.
Now,

219
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,710
so the example I used in the book to try
and they sort of described that is a 

220
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,341
chess board.
You Got White squares and black squares 

221
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:04,011
and you and you know,
you played with the white chessman of 

222
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:06,100
the Webinar.
If I changed all the white squares into 

223
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,270
black squares and I rotated the board by
90 degrees it would look identical.

224
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,210
And if I changed the black players,
white players and white players,

225
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:16,440
the black players,
the game of chess would be identical.

226
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,530
Nothing would change about it.
So what's white and what's black is kind

227
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,760
of arbitrary,
right?

228
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,800
It doesn't matter.
Which is good because it kind of wasn't 

229
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,521
than chess wouldn't be a fun game 
because if you always had black you 

230
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:28,521
might win.
If you always had white,

231
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:28,740
you might win,
but it's,

232
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,980
it's the same,
right?

233
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,870
Right.
So,

234
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,010
so I could change all white squares to 
black squares and black squares,

235
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,740
two white squares and the game of chess 
would not change.

236
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,590
So that's a symmetry of the chessboard 
and that's like,

237
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:46,010
that's like electric charge,
white being negative or positive and 

238
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,010
black being,
you know,

239
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,150
let's say I say white is negative and 
black is positive.

240
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,310
If I switched all black to white or 
negative positive,

241
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:52,350
nothing would change about the game of 
chess.

242
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,380
If I switch negative to positive in the 
universe,

243
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,200
nothing changes in the universe.
The game of life,

244
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,470
the game of physics would not change.
The rules wouldn't change.

245
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,980
The dynamics.
Everything would remain the same about 

246
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,131
the universe.
So that you could sort of see even that 

247
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:10,131
is not so easy.
I can tell from looking at your face,

248
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,140
it's already not so easy.
Okay,

249
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,180
but,
but you couldn't sort of accept that.

250
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,020
Yes.
Okay.

251
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,400
Okay.
That's the easy part.

252
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,610
Okay,
so here's what gates symmetry says,

253
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,900
man,
this is really weird.

254
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,280
I can actually do better than that.
I can arbitrarily change each white 

255
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,450
squares on a chess board to a black 
square.

256
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,320
I can choose randomly which white scares
to change the black squares and I can 

257
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,761
still make the game of chess the same if
I just have a rule book and the robot 

258
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,760
tells me,
Oh,

259
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:49,761
if you're on that square,
you can do what you could have done if 

260
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:49,980
it was a white square.
So if I have the rule book,

261
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,870
then it doesn't matter what color is the
squares are.

262
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,430
If I know I was in the square that used 
to be white,

263
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:55,750
but I call it black and I look at and 
say,

264
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,270
okay,
my my night can do this and that square,

265
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,340
but it couldn't do that.
So if I have a rule book,

266
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:00,940
then what?

267
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,120
Then I've arbitrarily free to change the
color of each square on a chess board.

268
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,030
As long as a rule book tells me what 
I've done,

269
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,340
right.
That's,

270
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,490
that's electromagnetism because it turns
out electromagnetism as a symmetry that 

271
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,630
says,
you know what,

272
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,050
I could change the definition of the 
charge on electron here,

273
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,350
but in the next room differently.
So I could call this electron positive 

274
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,990
and one negative and it wouldn't change 
anything as long as they had a rule book

275
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,290
that told me that I made that change.
And how and how the electromagnetic 

276
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,490
interaction would be the same as long as
I,

277
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,730
I,
I'm free to change the definition of 

278
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:40,730
what I call positive and negative charge
locally,

279
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,420
not globally.
That means I can do it differently here 

280
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,420
and there as long as I have a rule book 
that says,

281
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,270
you know what,
that electron used to be negative.

282
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,570
So it'll still repel this electron here,
even though I call it positive and I 

283
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,810
call that negative.
I've changed locally the definition,

284
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,270
but I also changed the rules.
I understand that.

285
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,800
Okay,
now the need for the rule book.

286
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,830
Now it turns out that the rule book 
really tells you it's a rule at each 

287
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,680
point in space,
right?

288
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,710
It's a rule tells you what you can and 
can't do at each point in space.

289
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,520
So we call that a function because the 
function is a number or a rule at each 

290
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,330
point in space.
A function at space is,

291
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:13,540
uh,
is,

292
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,230
is exactly that.
Well,

293
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:19,870
it turns out the function that does that
is the electromagnetic field.

294
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,410
If you ask what would be the 
mathematical characteristics of a 

295
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,591
quantity that would make sure the rules 
remain the same no matter what I called 

296
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:33,450
an electronic place to place and you 
asked how I could write it down 

297
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,421
mathematically,
it would have exactly the mathematical 

298
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:38,920
form of the electromagnetic field,
the thing that that we call the electric

299
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:39,940
field or magnetic field.

300
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,480
The mathematics of it is precisely fixed
by being able to allow us to change the 

301
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:53,761
definition of charge from place to place
in a way that doesn't change the 

302
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:54,910
ultimate dynamics doesn't change the way
the world works.

303
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,180
It's prescribed by the mathematics of 
the rule book is prescribed and the 

304
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,441
mathematics of that rule book turns out 
magically almost to be exactly the 

305
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:08,431
mathematics of Maxwell's equations,
which are the equations of 

306
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:08,880
electromagnetism.
Here's where it gets squirrely from it.

307
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,700
Why would you do that?
Why would you change the definitions?

308
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,710
Why would you need that rule book?
Well,

309
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,730
because I mean what it says is that 
nature somehow as the symmetry,

310
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,060
it doesn't depend what will you don't 
want to,

311
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:26,980
but it says nature.
Nature has designed itself such that the

312
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,890
definition of electric charge from place
to place is arbitrary.

313
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,100
It really came.
If you want to step back,

314
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,460
Einstein told us,
you know that length and time are kind 

315
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,931
of relative to be.
They depend upon the observer and his 

316
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:43,810
theory of general relativity actually 
said,

317
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,460
I can define locally what my coordinate 
system is,

318
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,080
what my length is,
what my time is.

319
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,490
I can define that arbitrarily locally

320
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,940
and it may differ from place to place.
My rulers could differ from place to 

321
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,631
place but the war,
but the universe doesn't care because 

322
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,201
there's this thing called the 
gravitational field that takes into 

323
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:05,201
account of that and nature has that 
cemetery.

324
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:07,460
So it doesn't matter if I change the 
rule book,

325
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,430
if I change the what I define as space 
and time locally,

326
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,120
the universe behaves exactly the same.
So when you say by symmetry,

327
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:19,121
do you mean essentially there's a 
balance that there's always going to be 

328
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:19,340
an equal numbers of negatives and 
positives and that's changed.

329
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,200
That's the functions of each one.
Well,

330
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,230
it balances itself out as well.
That's sort of a consequence.

331
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:24,650
It says

332
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,970
universe can't be charged and 
ultimately.

333
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,790
But no,
it really says that that's.

334
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,080
That's a quality of nature,
that nature doesn't care about law.

335
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,120
Namely you.
That's a.

336
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,650
that's a label,
but nature has a symmetry in physics.

337
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,090
Symmetries are things when you make 
changes,

338
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,170
they don't.
Then the object doesn't change.

339
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,840
Take a sphere.
Okay,

340
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,250
that's fair.
You can rotate it,

341
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,550
but it looks like a sphere.
No matter what rotation you make,

342
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,530
right?
That's a symmetry of the sphere.

343
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:59,520
That's why it's so beautiful in 
mathematically is the same way.

344
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,790
I can take another quantity,
I'll call it electric charge at this 

345
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,580
point and I can change it if you want to
say,

346
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:10,581
make a rotation and some internal space 
and I can imagine an internal space of 

347
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:12,120
positive and negative charges were part 
of some continuum.

348
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:15,630
I make a rotation and nature doesn't 
care about it.

349
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:18,240
It's a symmetry of the equations that 
govern nature,

350
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,820
but it turns out the reason this is 
important.

351
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,580
Let me step back again because your face
tells it all.

352
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,380
I wish people could see it.
They can.

353
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:25,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

354
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,110
And,
and,

355
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:31,250
and um,
so what we've discovered is that the 

356
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:38,961
playing field determines the rules.
The characteristics of the playing 

357
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:39,270
field's determine the roles.
If baseball,

358
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:43,530
if you played baseball and there were 
five bases instead of for the rules will

359
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:48,531
be different.
If the distance between home plate and 

360
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:49,200
first base was a mile,
the rules would be different.

361
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,040
If you had 25 out of feelers out in 
Outfield,

362
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,750
it would be different.
Okay.

363
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,720
So the playing field determines the 
rules,

364
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,910
right?
You can't.

365
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,340
Baseball will be very different game if 
we played on a field that's different.

366
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,180
What we've discovered in nature as we 
used to think the forces were kind of 

367
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,180
fundamental,
you know,

368
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,240
Newton told us that goes man and all 
that.

369
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,440
What we discovered is the thing that 
really constrains what can happen in the

370
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:17,640
world is the playing field and the 
characteristics of the playing field.

371
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:23,090
And for physicists,
what determines the characteristics of 

372
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:23,340
the playing field are the symmetries of 
that playing field.

373
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,170
In fact,
baseball,

374
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:27,990
the fact that it looks like a diamond is
a is a symmetry,

375
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:28,500
right?
I can.

376
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,410
The thing feel looks the same.
I could call first base,

377
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:34,800
home plate and home played first base if
I rotated the whole field,

378
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:38,170
right?
It determines in some sense that's the.

379
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,230
That's a characteristic of baseball that
sort of determines the rules of the 

380
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,980
game.
Okay.

381
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:49,310
And what we've learned is what's really 
fundamental in nature is the of that 

382
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:54,741
playing field and what determines the 
characteristics that playing fields are 

383
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,281
the symmetries of nature,
the things that that demonstrate to us 

384
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:02,750
that what we think is fundamental is 
really just an arbitrary label like 

385
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,741
electric charge isn't we've discovered 
is an arbitrary label locally as well as

386
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,231
globally,
and that determines the whole nature of 

387
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:12,231
the forces that can happen.

388
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:14,940
Once you say the electric charge is an 
arbitrary thing in nature,

389
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:18,300
doesn't care what you call positive and 
negative from here or Mars.

390
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:24,050
That determines the nature of the force 
of what we call the electromagnetic 

391
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,011
force.
It's completely prescribed and it turns 

392
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:28,011
out that's true for all the forces of 
nature.

393
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,170
The nature of gravity is determined as 
Einstein showed by the fact that you can

394
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:38,271
change what I define as one meter here 
and on Mars called one meter or 

395
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:42,090
something else and nature doesn't care 
what I label as a meter.

396
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,900
It turns out gravity takes that into 
account and says what we define as 

397
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:53,631
length is irrelevant.
The fundamental gravitational field is 

398
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:56,751
due to a curvature of space that that is
independent of what we define as length 

399
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,480
or time locally.
It's a weird thing,

400
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:05,481
but it's a property of space and time 
that Einstein discovered for general 

401
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:05,481
relativity.

402
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:06,030
We've discovered it for 
electromagnetism.

403
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,060
It turns out all the forces of nature 
respect that same kind of same kind of 

404
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:16,491
mathematical symmetry,
that there's some quantity that you can 

405
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:20,151
change in your equations.
I can change its definition and the 

406
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:23,310
equations,
but the physics remains the same and the

407
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,220
nature of the equations this is 
prescribed.

408
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,900
The mathematical form of the prescribe 
equations is prescribed precisely by the

409
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:34,680
requirement that I can change.
In the case of electric charge.

410
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:39,681
That electric charge is arbitrary,
I can call an electron positive or 

411
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,400
negative anywhere I want in space,
and the equations don't care.

412
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,980
That prescribes the fourth formula 
equations.

413
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:45,690
They have to have a very particular 
form,

414
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:51,020
a unique form,
and that unique for them happens to be 

415
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,400
the form that it has now,
so you can say,

416
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:58,401
look,
it's an accident that really there's 

417
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:00,501
something fundamental that the equations
have this form in low and we've 

418
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:03,741
discovered this mathematical symmetry is
an accident or you can say that the 

419
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:08,151
mathematical symmetry is fundamental.
It's a property of nature and it 

420
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:11,890
prescribes the form of the kind of 
forces that nature that the world.

421
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:12,390
Laos.

422
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,820
When you say that the,
the,

423
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,790
that it's fundamental that the 
dissymmetry is fundamental.

424
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,330
Do you see this image?
Do you study like ecosystems?

425
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:23,180
Do you study?
Like I know about them but I'm an but do

426
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:28,181
you ever contemplate them?
When you thinking about theoretical 

427
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:30,461
physics and when you,
do you ever look at like how these 

428
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:32,000
animals sort of stay in balance in these
ecosystems when they're untouched?

429
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,500
Well,
I mean the mathematics of.

430
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:35,270
I mean that's the great thing about 
physics.

431
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:38,270
About Science in general,
it's kind of like Hollywood,

432
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,350
if it works,
you copy it

433
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,680
and and so we often find the same 
mathematical formalism plight,

434
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,740
a vastly different systems,
so there's a famous set of equations of 

435
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,900
Predator and prey for ecosystems and 
and,

436
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,980
and you can look at those equations and 
they're the same kind of equations that 

437
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,640
apply in many different systems and in,
in,

438
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,930
in oatmeal boiling and also it's amazing
how the same mathematics appears and 

439
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:08,281
very different systems and we can 
therefore use what we've learned in one 

440
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:11,611
case to apply to another.
That's why we copy it because it works 

441
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:14,671
so broadly.
It's amazing that very few equations 

442
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:18,260
turn out to so broadly described so many
vastly different systems and Predator 

443
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:23,281
prey relationships,
which is I think what you're talking 

444
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,351
about in ecosystems,
how you know there's a in an evening 

445
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:25,351
with plants as well.
I mean,

446
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,050
I mean,
I mean like the full system.

447
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,710
Yeah.
Once you.

448
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,560
And it becomes more complicated when you
include more variables,

449
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,370
but physics of course is generally much 
easier than many ecosystems.

450
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,960
That's why I do physics.
It's so much easier.

451
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,250
It's because it's really the low hanging
fruit nature and it's fun for you.

452
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,120
Well,
I know,

453
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:40,680
but,
but,

454
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,720
but for most people listening to this is
probably 100 people that have driven 

455
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,991
into trees by now.
Like what the fuck is this guy talking 

456
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:52,171
about?
I'm glad there's people like you out 

457
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:55,201
there that are.
They can feel good that the laws of 

458
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:55,420
physics are independent of whether 
they've run into the tree.

459
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:58,210
So feel good.
I'm sure that gives them great comfort.

460
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,400
Yeah,
exactly.

461
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,270
It's just the study of this is so it's 
so taxing.

462
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,590
It is,
but you know,

463
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:06,820
that's okay.
I mean,

464
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,920
sure.
What,

465
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,020
what,
what sort of bothers me is that people 

466
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,040
when they think it might be,
might be taxing.

467
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,040
They don't want to think about it,
but the interesting thing is that 

468
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,470
doesn't apply in other areas of actually
so people can be.

469
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,710
They don't think they have to be or 
Clapton to enjoy guitar music or pub or 

470
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,320
Picasso to enjoy where paintings or,
or Shakespeare to enjoy place,

471
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,890
but somehow and all of that,
that's taxing in its own way.

472
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,130
Okay.
And the more you want.

473
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,200
Let's,
let's take Bach.

474
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:38,560
The more you understand music,
I'm sure the more you appreciate box,

475
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,390
Bach Cantatas,
all the different voices,

476
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,700
but I can enjoy just listening to it,
right?

477
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,240
And,
and,

478
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,950
but people say in every other activity 
it's fine,

479
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,760
but when it comes to science they say,
Nah,

480
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,790
it's not easy for me.
I can't even touch it at all and what I 

481
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,700
try and do in my books and a place to 
say,

482
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,880
look,
there's things you don't have to master 

483
00:22:59,880 --> 00:22:59,880
it,
but,

484
00:22:59,880 --> 00:22:59,880
and,
and so you may not know.

485
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,020
Master gave some of the most subtle and 
complicated thing in all of modern 

486
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,450
physics,
but you can still,

487
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,220
even if you skip that section of the 
book,

488
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,700
there are still things in there.
You can appreciate it.

489
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:12,640
But how we understand the world that we 
couldn't appreciate before and have that

490
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,641
orgasmic Aha experience that hey,
the world is different than I thought 

491
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,200
and that's,
that's what's wonderful.

492
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,480
So you can appreciate science without 
mastering.

493
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:27,481
It's sure it gates,
symmetry and things like that are 

494
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:31,860
basically mathematical concepts.
So to talk about them in language 

495
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,870
without math is always sort of verbose.
Well,

496
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,700
I think what's important about your 
book,

497
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,570
I'm in chapter 10 or 11,
I think.

498
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,120
I think what's,
what's really important about it is not,

499
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,100
you're not speaking in layman's,
but you're also

500
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,250
not speaking in theoretical physicist 
terms.

501
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,690
You're making a bridge.

502
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,670
Well,
yeah.

503
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,600
And,
and someone,

504
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:57,601
I think Richard,
a few people said nicely said about the 

505
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:58,530
book that as they say,
they claimed as long would said,

506
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,780
I'm trying to make it simple but not 
simpler than it can be.

507
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,290
Yes.
And I think the right way saying,

508
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,750
well,
but I think it's important to do that,

509
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:06,730
right?
I mean as it respects the reader,

510
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,050
because it doesn't,
you know,

511
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,620
it,
it,

512
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,720
it says,
look,

513
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,010
you want to understand it,
okay,

514
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:12,730
here's,
here's,

515
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,760
here's what you need to know it,
understand it and here's how I can try 

516
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,931
and explain it without math.
And you can puzzle through it and think 

517
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:22,870
about it and eventually maybe get to 
that Aha stage.

518
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,880
But,
or I could just say,

519
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,290
you know,
poof,

520
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,460
it all happened,
you know,

521
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,050
and then that's religion in a way.
But except the differences.

522
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,400
This as content religion doesn't

523
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,420
for people like me that have never 
studied it.

524
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,660
When I read what you're doing in a read 
what's been done and I read all of the 

525
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:44,911
people out there that are trying to 
decipher all this magical stuff out 

526
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:44,950
there in the universe.
It's,

527
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,060
it's,
it's important to just to be aware that 

528
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,570
this is going on because I think for the
vast majority of the 7 billion people on

529
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:55,540
the planet,
this is just unknown exactly,

530
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,760
but it said it's being.
It's being discovered,

531
00:24:57,761 --> 00:25:00,280
it's being contemplated,
it's being studied

532
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,470
and it's not just that it's being done,
but it's amazing.

533
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,670
It has changed our picture of our place 
in the universe and therefore I think 

534
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:11,030
science is like art and music and 
literature.

535
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:16,031
It's they all serve the same purpose.
Science also produces technology and 

536
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,780
somehow people think that's all.
Science is good for sure.

537
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:19,280
It produces the technology that's 
making,

538
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:24,310
allowing you and I'd have this 
conversation and people to listen as 

539
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,310
long as you and I live longer,
all of the rest,

540
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,230
but the really neat thing about science 
is it is just like those other things.

541
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,680
It changes our perspective of ourselves 
and,

542
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,740
and that's what's so wonderful that I 
once said that science is sort of one of

543
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,850
the purposes is to make people 
uncomfortable.

544
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,740
And I thought I felt regretted that for 
a while,

545
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:44,741
but it really isn't.
If you're never outside your comfort 

546
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:44,741
zone,
then you're never,

547
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:45,920
you're never growing.
I completely agree.

548
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:47,030
And I love that quote in the book.

549
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,870
Um,
I think that for,

550
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,940
for a lot of people that discomfort is 
just people are tired,

551
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,740
you know,
they work the jobs,

552
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:59,741
they've got families,
they've got a lot of stuff to do and 

553
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:01,960
something like this comes along that 
just like throws a monkey wrench into 

554
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:01,960
the gears of the mind.

555
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,190
Yeah,
it does.

556
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:04,760
But sometimes you want your mind blown 
and sometimes you know,

557
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,870
you can skim over or I try with him 
books and say,

558
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:08,640
okay,
so that part you can get,

559
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:09,470
but,
but you know,

560
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,180
it's not like suddenly you won't 
understand the rest of the book.

561
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,260
And the stuff is so neat.
The idea that there's this invisible 

562
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,550
field everywhere in the universe that 
changes the way you haven't got there,

563
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,220
the book yet.
But,

564
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:25,430
but that changes our picture of the 
universe is amazing and people should 

565
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,370
have the opportunity to know that our 
picture is shown that we are a cosmic 

566
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,750
accident that were just like an icicle 
on a window,

567
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:39,030
that whose direction if you lived on 
that icicle might seem very special to 

568
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,701
you,
but as an accident and it turns out the 

569
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:47,040
forces nature are what they are by the 
same kind of accident because some field

570
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,470
froze in the early universe in some 
direction.

571
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,670
If it had frozen in another direction,
you and I wouldn't be having this 

572
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,261
conversation.
That's what we would we be a different 

573
00:26:57,261 --> 00:26:57,261
thing.
In fact,

574
00:26:57,261 --> 00:27:01,700
in most cases you wouldn't even have you
and me because there wouldn't be 

575
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,151
particles that have mass and you 
wouldn't have stars and galaxies and 

576
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:05,151
planets.
Now what?

577
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:05,160
There would be,
I can't say,

578
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,090
but I can definitely say that everything
we see in the universe would be gone.

579
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,240
But you're confident that it was an 
accident at some point in time and what 

580
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,940
I've created.
What I mean by accident.

581
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,330
No more of an accident or less of an 
accident than an icicle.

582
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:23,331
On a window now,
if you look at icicles on a window with 

583
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:23,331
they're beautiful patterns,
they're in all different directions now.

584
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:26,970
There's a physical reason ultimately why
one icicle forms in a,

585
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,910
in a given direction,
but there's no significance to that.

586
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,240
It may have been a dust particle that 
caused that part that we're not saying 

587
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,690
it's magic.
There was ultimately some micro physical

588
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:41,691
reason why that happened and why oatmeal
we'll boils a bubble up occurs in one 

589
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:42,150
place and not another,
but,

590
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,480
but there's nothing significant about 
that bubble popping up here or that 

591
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,840
icicle pointing in a given direction.
It's not fate and not fate.

592
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:52,410
It's not designed right it anything is 
possible in that icicle.

593
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,870
Okay,
and so what,

594
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,960
what I'm saying is our universe is the 
way it is because of field frozen a 

595
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,160
certain direction.
Now it's true.

596
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:04,161
There are laws of physics.
Say the field Kent can freeze in that 

597
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:04,350
direction,
but it's also laws of physics.

598
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,570
Say the field could have frozen maybe in
another direction,

599
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,300
and if it did,
everything would be different.

600
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,840
Now what my field would,
how are you defining where the field is?

601
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,250
A Oh,
you had you gotta take him.

602
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,890
Yeah.
No,

603
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,260
no,
no.

604
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,530
I was worried about the field is.
Well,

605
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,790
it's like the electric field.
Okay.

606
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,760
Some quantity that's defined in each 
point in space.

607
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,440
And,
and the neat thing in particle physics 

608
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,440
is every field,
like an electric field,

609
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,650
every field is associated with an 
elementary particle.

610
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,930
So the electric field is produced by a 
coherent state of photons,

611
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,470
the ultimate Quanta of electromagnetism,
the,

612
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,320
the,
the individual particles that are,

613
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,380
that are being,
that are going into your eye right now 

614
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,380
and are being absorbed by your eyes.
So you can see me.

615
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,800
The reason you can see light is it's a 
lot of little particles entering your 

616
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,341
eye that had been that,
that are reflecting off my eyes so you 

617
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:55,341
can see them.
Okay?

618
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:58,680
And it turns out in quantum mechanics,
every field,

619
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,340
which is a point which is a function of 
points in space.

620
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,870
The electric field in this room,
there are,

621
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,540
there's a magnetic field in this room 
because we're in the here in the.

622
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,190
In the earth has a magnetic field,
right?

623
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:13,191
If they put a compass here,
will feel the magnetic field that's 

624
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:16,640
actually.
There's this coherent state of photons 

625
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,180
that are basically very regular in 
space.

626
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,370
That's really what a field is,
and quantum physics,

627
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,640
a very regular configuration of 
elementary particles that are sort of 

628
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,290
hidden in space and it turns out there's
this background fields we call the higgs

629
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,740
field,
which is everywhere in space and happens

630
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:36,741
to have a very particular configuration 
and then when the particles that make 

631
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,190
your body and my body up,
when we moved through it,

632
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,460
they experienced a resistance that 
causes them to behave as if they have 

633
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,050
mass.
If the field wasn't there,

634
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,260
the particles will be massless.
It's like swimming in molasses.

635
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,220
It's,
you know,

636
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,980
if you're swimming in water,
you feel pretty light,

637
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:54,490
but if I've filled the pool up with 
molasses and you tried to do 100 meters,

638
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,230
you'd be pretty damn tired.
At the end of it,

639
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:58,240
you'd feel like you're weigh thousands 
of pounds.

640
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,570
We're swimming through molasses.
We just don't see it.

641
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,370
It's amazing.
It's there.

642
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,690
I mean,
it sounds like,

643
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,090
as I was just saying to a group earlier 
today,

644
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,120
it sounds like religion,
right?

645
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:15,121
I think there's an invisible field 
everywhere that's responsible for our 

646
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:15,121
existence.
That sounds like religion,

647
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:17,980
except for the fact in physics we can 
say that's not good enough.

648
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,010
If it's there,
we got to find it and if it's there,

649
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:26,011
what do we do?
If that field is associated with 

650
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:26,011
particles?
If I,

651
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:27,310
as I as I like to say,
it's cosmic sadomasochism.

652
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,670
If I spank the vacuum,
if I dumped enough energy and empty 

653
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,910
space at a single point,
I should kick out real particles.

654
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,150
If that field is there,
if the higgs field is there,

655
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,600
if I dump enough energy and empty space,
I'll kick out real particles.

656
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:42,880
I'll call them Hicks particles,
and you know what?

657
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,900
Let me build a big machine in Geneva,
the biggest and most complicated machine

658
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:51,901
humans have ever built,
call it the large Hadron collider that 

659
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:54,991
dumps enough energy into a point in 
space that can maybe kick out higgs 

660
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:55,630
particles of the really there and you 
know what?

661
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,360
They're there.
On July Fourth,

662
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:03,361
2012,
we announced the discovery of 50 

663
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,170
particles that looked and sounded and 
walked and quack like Higgs is,

664
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,500
and we now have tested them much more 
produced many more and they're they're 

665
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,470
higgs particle.
They gives us evidence that that field 

666
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,740
exists.
It was an outrageous and audacious claim

667
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,070
that the properties of the universe we 
see are an accident due to this 

668
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,451
background field that's there,
and if that background field wasn't 

669
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:24,451
there,
the world would look very different.

670
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,300
It's an amazing claim,
but is it a consequence of this field or

671
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:29,620
an accident?
Well,

672
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,310
the properties of the universe we 
experienced are consequences that field,

673
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,730
but that field being there is as much an
accident as an icicle freezing on a 

674
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,841
window in a certain direction.
The field could have frozen with a 

675
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:45,721
different value.
It could have frozen with a different 

676
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:47,360
magnitude or if that's where I'm gone.
Well not just that.

677
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:52,590
It's very difficult for me to understand
why you can determine in one way or 

678
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:52,810
another,
the field here.

679
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:57,811
Here.
Let me give you an example that I try 

680
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:57,811
and use.
In fact,

681
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:57,820
it just got a version of it just got.
When I went online,

682
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:01,120
I used a beer bottle as an example.
You may have drunk beer once or twice in

683
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:01,870
your life.
I have.

684
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,530
Okay,
good.

685
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,210
I don't know if you've ever had a party.

686
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:09,330
I have.
And you forgot to put the beer in the 

687
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:09,330
fridge.
So have done.

688
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:09,400
Put it in the freezer.
Okay.

689
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,160
So.
And then what happens?

690
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,680
You forget that it's in the freezer and 
then.

691
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,210
And then the next morning you discovered
in the freezer explodes.

692
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,410
Explodes.
Got It.

693
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,230
Why?
Because really the,

694
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,540
the,
the beer would rather be frozen,

695
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,690
but when it's under pressure in the 
bottle it's liquid.

696
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,580
Okay.
But for example,

697
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:32,581
if you open the top,
so the pressure is released and it's 

698
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:32,581
suddenly freezes.
Okay.

699
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:34,030
The beer has changed from one state to 
another.

700
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,000
It's gone from liquid to solid.
When it's gone to solid,

701
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,590
it's suddenly releases a lot of energy.
Okay.

702
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,460
If you wish,
you could think of the,

703
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,470
uh,
of the properties of that beer as a 

704
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,470
field.
It can either be liquid or solid.

705
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,650
Okay.
And it changes depending upon the 

706
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:53,650
temperature and the pressure and all the
rest,

707
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,020
it turns out the state of the universe 
changes as the universe cools.

708
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,510
And you can think of that.
Higgs is like the,

709
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,260
as like a sort of a cosmic fluid that's 
everywhere.

710
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,440
And as a universe cooled down,
suddenly it found would rather be in a 

711
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,110
certain configuration.
It would rather be frozen in liquid.

712
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Okay.
And at some numbers that tell you 

713
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:14,800
whether it's acting like it's frozen or 
liquid,

714
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,150
just like I could describe the beer and 
I could define some numbers that would 

715
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:19,970
tell me whether the beer was frozen or 
liquid.

716
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,630
And so as the universe cooled,
that cosmic fluid,

717
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,580
which is everywhere,
all these elementary particles,

718
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:29,210
if you wish,
that are permeating space suddenly found

719
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:34,211
themselves preferring as the universe 
cool down to be in a certain 

720
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,120
configuration rather than another 
configuration.

721
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Okay.
Then it really is no different than the 

722
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:40,720
arbitrary state of an icicle know 
exactly.

723
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,700
It's just essentially as arbitrary.
It's not magic and it's not as if you 

724
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,381
know,
if we in some sense the accidents of 

725
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:54,381
what the dust that's on your window and 
the wind that's blowing and everything 

726
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:55,940
else is going to determine what that,
what that pattern looks like,

727
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,860
but every day if you had a new cold day,
the icicle pattern would look different.

728
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:06,430
Okay.
It's not as if every day you'd have the 

729
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,831
same icicle pattern on your window.
It would be different and that's what I 

730
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:12,161
mean by an accident.
It's not as if the laws of physics at 

731
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:15,011
some level of couldn't have told you 
that if you knew all the configurations 

732
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:15,560
on that day why would look one way or 
another,

733
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,750
but it's not significant.
I guess what I mean,

734
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:22,930
there's no special significance to that 
pattern that meant God meant it to be 

735
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,390
and there's no special significance to 
the universe in which we live.

736
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,980
That meant God meant it to be.
It could have been quite different.

737
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,190
We should celebrate that.
It's not quite different because you and

738
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:37,790
I can have this conversation,
so it's a wonderful thing that it is the

739
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:41,510
way it is and let's celebrate that.
We're that we've evolved and I can still

740
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:42,410
say that word in this country.

741
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:47,360
We've evolved a consciousness so that we
can appreciate all of the wonders of the

742
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:52,361
universe.
Let's celebrate that so it doesn't mean 

743
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:52,361
we're meaningless just because the 
universe has no purpose.

744
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:57,490
We make our own purpose in our own life.
It means to me in some sense that life 

745
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,721
is more purposeful.
There isn't someone pulling the strings 

746
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:04,990
were pulling the strings,
and so it's okay to live in a 

747
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,890
purposeless universe.
It doesn't make life worse.

748
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:11,891
It makes it much better.
We just always ascribed significance to 

749
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:14,900
things that happened to us.
The physicist Richard Feynman used to,

750
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,550
used to go up to people and he used to 
say,

751
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,870
you won't believe what happened to me 
today.

752
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,580
You won't believe,
and people say,

753
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:22,040
why do you say absolutely nothing?
Okay?

754
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,040
Because when things happen to you,
suddenly they're significant.

755
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,370
You know what?
You have a million crazy dreams and then

756
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:30,230
one night you dream that your friend is 
going to break their arm.

757
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,460
The next day they break their leg.
You Go,

758
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,500
Oh my God,
I'm clairvoyant.

759
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,730
You know?
Or he'll say that.

760
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,800
He'll say,
you know,

761
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,630
I just saw a license plate.
I,

762
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,590
you wouldn't believe I just saw a 
license plate.

763
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,570
It wasj two,
four,

764
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,200
seven,
nine,

765
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:44,250
six.
Can you believe it?

766
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,100
Because you know,
that's a significant,

767
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:50,060
a single license plate that says one 
one,

768
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:50,330
one,
one,

769
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:50,720
one,
one,

770
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,200
one or,
or a license plate that says,

771
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:53,640
I am God.
Okay?

772
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,300
They're all just as significant.
But the things that appear to mean 

773
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,571
something to us suddenly take on some 
significance because we're hardwired to 

774
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:04,620
want to believe.
Just like the x file said,

775
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,200
we want to believe.
We all want to believe we are.

776
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,600
We're hard.
But well,

777
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,740
here's the reason we want to ascribe,
ascribe meaning to everything.

778
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,380
And I think there's an evolutionary 
reason for that.

779
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,680
For example,
if you're a,

780
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,920
uh,
an early modern human on the Savanna in 

781
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,951
Africa,
the leaves can be rustling in the trees 

782
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:27,951
next to you.

783
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:27,951
You can say,
ah,

784
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,870
no reason,
or he can say maybe there's a lion there

785
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,680
and what happened was,
so maybe there's a line causing maybe 

786
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,591
there's a cause for that happening now 
that those of our potential ancestors 

787
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:44,601
that said isn't a reason they got eaten,
the ones that didn't are the ones that 

788
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:48,180
we produced.
Right?

789
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:53,190
Right.
And so in some sense we're kind of hard 

790
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,690
wired by evolution to want to find 
purpose and meaning and everything,

791
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,240
but isn't that just recognizing danger 
or potential danger?

792
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:59,360
Of course it is in that case,
but,

793
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,240
but,
but,

794
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,940
but have side effect of anticipating 
danger is to ascribe significance to 

795
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:11,931
things that may not.
You're much luckier if you're much 

796
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:15,680
luckier,
but you're much more likely to survive 

797
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:15,690
if you ascribed significance to 
everything.

798
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,200
Perhaps in the early days then if he was
grabbing significance to nothing.

799
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,660
But when you say,
when you're talking about significance,

800
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:26,661
essentially you're talking about divine 
significance about it can be divine 

801
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,690
significance,
but it can just be.

802
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,470
You can think there's more more to it 
than meets the eye.

803
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Right?
But when you're talking about 

804
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,581
clairvoyance or when you talk about some
sort of a divine intervention by a 

805
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:40,080
deity,
you're talking about something powerful.

806
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:43,320
This is the one that is meant to be the 
leader of this tribe,

807
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,240
but that's the consequence,
right?

808
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:46,470
Yeah,
but it works at all levels.

809
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,800
It works at all levels,
from the fact that the leaves are 

810
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,590
rustling and it means that line.
But once we have that hard wired thing,

811
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:54,400
then we want to be then our,
our,

812
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:56,750
our desire to believe continues and,
and,

813
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,830
and social beings may be found that if 
they imposed some meaning on the 

814
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,810
universe,
on a universe which otherwise is hostile

815
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,960
and dangerous,
that maybe it might help bind them in 

816
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,471
tribes that maybe would help Mike make 
them happier about being alive early on 

817
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:15,000
because they might be so scared of a 
universe that wants to kill them all the

818
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,950
time that it would bolden them.

819
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,470
So there's obviously an evolutionary 
purpose to,

820
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,860
to what is religion,
because if there wasn't,

821
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:24,180
religions wouldn't be everywhere.
Right?

822
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,340
I mean pretty well.
All human cultures have religions.

823
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,470
Each one is inconsistent with every 
other one.

824
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,290
But which was the reason we know that 
they're probably all wrong,

825
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,280
but,
but it works the that it's universal,

826
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:40,840
must mean there's some evolutionary 
utility to the believing,

827
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,680
but then certain things eventually,
even though they worked and were useful 

828
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,370
early on,
as our human condition changes,

829
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,380
they may not be so useful.
Well,

830
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:53,200
that seems to be the place where we're 
at now as a civilization.

831
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:53,970
Exactly.
I,

832
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,740
I would argue that religion is turning 
out to be counterproductive.

833
00:38:56,741 --> 00:39:00,070
Now it may have been useful early on in 
human history,

834
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,200
but now what it's doing is it's getting 
in the way,

835
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:07,201
not only of progress,
but have a few in cooperation and so 

836
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:11,530
evolution is now is now 
counterproductive.

837
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,920
But the great thing is we have,
we have a consciousness.

838
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:19,921
We have an intellect,
so we can actually overcome that 

839
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:23,160
evolutionary predilection by realizing 
we have that predilection and as as 

840
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,231
firemen said,
that the easiest person to fool is 

841
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:27,600
yourself.
So if you're a scientist,

842
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:30,640
what you have to do is ask yourself,
am I believing that?

843
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,470
Because I want to believer because 
there's evidence.

844
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,130
So if we constantly are,
are skeptical of ourselves,

845
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,960
we can know to overcome that ingrained 
impulse,

846
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,990
we have to want to believe that's one of
the utilities of science.

847
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,670
So I may listen to you and like you and 
I may listen to another radio person and

848
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:52,680
not like them and I may be therefore 
naturally willing to assume that they're

849
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,540
wrong and you're right.
But I should also say to myself,

850
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,380
is it really the case or is it just 
because I like Joe Rogan and I don't 

851
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,380
like,
you know,

852
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,110
you pick your favorite right wing nut,
right?

853
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,920
And,
and,

854
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,680
and so we should be asking ourselves,
okay,

855
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:08,890
maybe I should go beyond my 
predilections,

856
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:14,070
me on my biases to ask why I am 
sympathetic to what I'm hearing.

857
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:19,970
And if we did that in everyday life,
I think we cut through the crap more 

858
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:19,970
carefully.
So science says,

859
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,781
look,
we are hardwired to want to have these 

860
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:25,780
weird beliefs and it's fine.
Maybe some of them are right,

861
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,760
but the only way to know is to test 
them.

862
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,860
If we're not willing to contest our 
beliefs and subject them to that,

863
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,190
the test of nature,
then then we're going to be diluted and 

864
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,220
that's the problem with that with a lot 
of what's happening in our government.

865
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:40,480
People saying,
you know what,

866
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:45,481
I really want to believe in this absurd 
story and therefore I refuse to accept 

867
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:46,940
evolution.
If you're the.

868
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,430
If you're Mike Pence,
the vice president,

869
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:49,270
the country,
you say,

870
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:50,910
I don't believe evolution because I 
don't.

871
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,160
It doesn't agree with my ridiculous 
fundamentalist ideas.

872
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:55,600
And he said that in Congress,
right?

873
00:40:55,601 --> 00:41:00,601
He said,
we shouldn't be teaching evolution in 

874
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:00,601
schools.
We should be teaching intelligent design

875
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:01,690
and and why?
Because he,

876
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,300
he,
it,

877
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,860
it offends his personal faith.
Perhaps it might also be a political 

878
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:12,151
ploy.
It might be a thing because he knows 

879
00:41:12,151 --> 00:41:13,921
that a large percentage of the country 
finds comfort in a leader that 

880
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:15,550
subscribes to the same sort of 
superstitions that they do.

881
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah,
I,

882
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,470
I,
that could be a.

883
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,420
He did this before.
He was in a national office.

884
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:21,900
He was a congressman.
I suspect he did it.

885
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,870
It sounds like he believed it,
but you're right.

886
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,360
Who knows,
right,

887
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,350
but at,
but the point is that we,

888
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,830
we,
we should realize that the only that,

889
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,510
that we shouldn't listen to that kind of
nonsense because we may not want,

890
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:38,720
because there are a lot of people in 
this country who do think that evolution

891
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:43,930
directly confronts their belief in God 
or the Big Bang directly confronts their

892
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:47,480
belief in God and therefore they don't 
want their children to learn about that.

893
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:52,930
But what an awful thing to do to your 
children to withhold evidence about how 

894
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:57,791
the world really works because you know 
you don't have to believe in the big 

895
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:57,791
bang,
but it really happened.

896
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:59,390
You don't have to believe in evolution,
but it happened.

897
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,950
It's like Philip K,
Dick said,

898
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,850
the science fiction writer reality is 
that which continues to exist.

899
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:06,770
Whether or not you believe in it,
okay,

900
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,920
and so you may not want to believe in 
it,

901
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:10,790
but it happened.
And,

902
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:16,070
and for you to withhold that kind of 
knowledge from your kids because you're 

903
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,060
worried it's gonna Affect.
Their faith is,

904
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:22,061
in my opinion,
child abuse because you're hindering 

905
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:24,581
their capabilities as an adult in a 
society which is highly technological to

906
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:27,050
function effectively.
They're doing it because they believe in

907
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:28,610
as well and they need.
It's right.

908
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:30,830
I'm not believing they think they're 
helping their kids,

909
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:32,510
but most of it,
I don't know if you're a parent.

910
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,340
I am.
We've all screwed up our kids,

911
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:36,740
right?
We all do things for our kids because we

912
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:40,400
think it's good for them and sometimes 
it is and sometimes it isn't.

913
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,870
I'm not saying these people are doing it
because they.

914
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,340
They want to hurt their children.
They think somehow that not believing in

915
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:48,350
God makes you a bad person.
Right?

916
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,450
But there's no evidence of that.
In fact,

917
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,920
in fact,
Steve Weinberg,

918
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,810
who was a Nobel prize winning physicist 
has said,

919
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:54,410
and I love it,
he,

920
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,130
he,
he said,

921
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,830
so they're good people in the world.
They're bad people.

922
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,620
Good people do good things,
bad people do bad things.

923
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,810
When good people do bad things,
it's religion.

924
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:09,250
Do you think that religion in its 
earliest stages was in a sense primitive

925
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:15,011
man with no science trying to figure out
the world and trying to have some sort 

926
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:20,231
of rules like almost like a scaffolding 
in order to to move to the next?

927
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,900
If you see that it exists in so many 
different cultures,

928
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,170
it might have been something along the 
course that way.

929
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:32,171
Was there effort.
It was their effort to understand the 

930
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:32,171
world around them based on what they 
knew it was noble.

931
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:37,120
You know,
they tried to understand the world and 

932
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,611
so there's nothing wrong with it,
but claiming that we today should be 

933
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:42,950
guided by the worldview of of illiterate
peasants in the Iron Age.

934
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:47,951
Peasants who who didn't know the earth 
orbiting the sun and wrote down 

935
00:43:47,951 --> 00:43:51,940
scriptures based on their beliefs at the
time they argue that that should guide 

936
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,481
our life.
Today when we discovered 100 billion 

937
00:43:55,481 --> 00:43:55,940
galaxies in the universe and discovered 
all this stuff is ludicrous.

938
00:43:55,941 --> 00:44:00,530
So you're absolutely the birth of 
science and religion are the same and in

939
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:02,180
fact,
modern science grew out of religion.

940
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,620
People point that out and they send to 
me,

941
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:05,630
how dare you talk about religion,
you know,

942
00:44:05,631 --> 00:44:07,010
as,
as being outdated.

943
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,950
Science grew out of religion and I say 
to them,

944
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:12,590
well that's fine,
but children outgrow their parents,

945
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,600
right?
So great.

946
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,320
No doubt.
Religious ideas and all our early 

947
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,381
scientists were religious because it was
the only game in town you couldn't be 

948
00:44:23,381 --> 00:44:26,531
educated except the church controlled 
all the universities and so it was like 

949
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,100
the National Science Foundation of the 
16th century.

950
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:33,430
It's not surprising they were all 
religious because that's that the only 

951
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,471
game in town so that,
that ca helped create the birth of 

952
00:44:36,471 --> 00:44:38,100
modern science.
But science outgrew it and that's okay.

953
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:40,200
Kids outgrow their parents.
Thank goodness.

954
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,430
Well,
I think maybe that might help kids 

955
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,471
outgrow their parents.
Why the getting religion forced down 

956
00:44:48,471 --> 00:44:50,130
your throat is one of the best ways for 
kids to,

957
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,050
for suggested as they get older.
Son,

958
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:53,340
for some kids,
kids like you and me.

959
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:55,320
But I get lots of letters.
You know,

960
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,380
we made this movie called the 
unbelievers and and which followed 

961
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,310
Richard Dawkins and I around the world 
as we talked about this stuff.

962
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,680
And it was nice and maybe I,
and I hope and it's a,

963
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,930
it's a well made film.
I liked the filmmakers have made it,

964
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:11,730
but I found people come up to me,
I had no idea of this.

965
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:14,460
It's one of the negative aspects of 
religion that I never appreciated.

966
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,390
I have people come up and he almost 
everyday I write me and saying,

967
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:23,391
you know what?
I saw that movie and I realized I'm not 

968
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:24,570
a bad person for asking questions and 
I'm not alone.

969
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,960
You know,
these people from small towns in 

970
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:29,960
Georgia,
they have no one to talk to.

971
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,470
They think that the only ones who's 
asked the question is God real?

972
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:34,820
Is it okay to not believe in God?
And they're told by everyone else you'll

973
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,750
not only you'll go to hell,
but you're a bad person.

974
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,750
And suddenly they discover that's not 
true.

975
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,870
And so I think there are a lot of people
who have that forced down their throats.

976
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,880
It's really hard when you're a kid,
you know and have these.

977
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,320
And that's why I do think any kind of 
religion for kids,

978
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:51,690
it's kind of child abuse,
not a no matter what,

979
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:56,691
because these concepts have a daily and 
the possible existence of a purpose of 

980
00:45:56,691 --> 00:46:01,050
the universe are very deep and subtle 
concepts and expect a three year old kid

981
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:02,230
to,
to,

982
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:07,630
to the ram that down a curial kid's 
throat is unfair because the kid 

983
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:07,630
candidate,
resident,

984
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,140
it ends up being internalized in ways.
And a lot of people,

985
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:15,470
you know,
I hear a lot of people who've had deep 

986
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:15,470
religious educations who say,
you know,

987
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,350
it's hard to outgrow that because when 
you get,

988
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,500
when that's thrust into you as a child,
it's really hard to over ever overcome 

989
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,731
it.
The guilt feelings that many religions 

990
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:26,580
introduce the fundamental notion that,
that you know,

991
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,140
you're ultimately sinful and no matter 
what you do is sinful,

992
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:36,290
is something a lot of people have,
hard times within that claim of sin is 

993
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,350
just so you know,
I've debated people who,

994
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,430
you know,
who argue that homosexuality is sinful,

995
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:43,780
you know,
and then,

996
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,180
and it's unnatural.

997
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,940
God intended it to be otherwise.
And then I pointed out,

998
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:48,720
well,
you know what,

999
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,990
you take all mammals,
10 percent in every species,

1000
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:54,630
almost 10 percent have homosexual 
relationships.

1001
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,960
Sheep have long,
10 percent of sheep have longterm 

1002
00:46:59,960 --> 00:46:59,960
homosexual relationships,
or they sinful.

1003
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,980
Okay?
It's not a natural at all.

1004
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,280
It's a natural consequence of whatever.
But now why it's a case,

1005
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,110
it's an interesting evolution in 
question,

1006
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,990
but it's certainly not a natural and it 
seems uniform than if it's 10 percent.

1007
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,580
So.
Well being a plus or minus a little bit,

1008
00:47:12,581 --> 00:47:15,420
it certainly seems to be biology.
There's some purpose,

1009
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,300
there's some,
there's some biological purpose to it.

1010
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,720
And so to argue that it's both unnatural
and wrong is to misunderstand biology.

1011
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,840
But people grow up being told it's evil 
because the Bible said it right?

1012
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:35,070
And then they don't want to give people 
who are homosexual the same rights as 

1013
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,341
other people because they tell them,
they say God didn't want them to have 

1014
00:47:38,341 --> 00:47:41,101
the officer.
So the problem is people are told these 

1015
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:42,220
things that are ultimately wrong because
you know,

1016
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:44,320
maybe you know,
because for whatever reason,

1017
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:49,300
the tribe that wrote down that that 
scripture wanted to make sure that there

1018
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,190
weren't homosexual relationships in the 
group,

1019
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,090
which just really

1020
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:57,180
baffling when you talk to people about 
the Bible in the Old Testament versus 

1021
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,470
the new testament and they don't even 
understand where the new testament was 

1022
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:01,210
created by Constantine and a bunch of 
bishops they throw up.

1023
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,360
And by the way,
they think it's kinder,

1024
00:48:03,361 --> 00:48:03,930
gentler.
Sure.

1025
00:48:03,931 --> 00:48:06,420
The Old Testament is one of the most,
you know,

1026
00:48:06,421 --> 00:48:08,670
look at the current people say the 
Qur'an is violent and vicious.

1027
00:48:08,671 --> 00:48:10,300
Read the Old Testament.
You know,

1028
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,270
you're supposed to stone your kids if 
they disobey you.

1029
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,040
Yeah.
And,

1030
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,350
and the reason killed people that were 
two different kinds of clauses.

1031
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:18,390
Exactly.
And the reason that nowadays,

1032
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:23,391
sort of the Abrahamic religions of 
Judaism and Christianity may seem a 

1033
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:25,140
little less violent than Islam for some 
people is because,

1034
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:28,710
you know,
people take the Quran literally,

1035
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,680
and that's part of sort of 
fundamentalist Islam.

1036
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:36,860
Very few,
very few people take the Bible as 

1037
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,560
literally as namely,
Hey,

1038
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:40,680
we're going to stone kids in the twelfth
century they may have,

1039
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,160
but now we've outgrown it and the is 600
years younger and so it's just the old 

1040
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,450
testament is just as violent as the 
Korean,

1041
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,040
but no one takes it seriously.

1042
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:55,430
But people,
most people who call themselves 

1043
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:56,991
religious,
they pick and choose the things they 

1044
00:48:56,991 --> 00:48:56,991
like from the Bible or the New Testament
or the old testament.

1045
00:48:56,991 --> 00:48:59,910
They pick and choose the nice kindler,
gentler things.

1046
00:48:59,911 --> 00:49:04,911
You know,
Richard Dawkins Foundation in England 

1047
00:49:04,911 --> 00:49:04,960
did an interesting survey.
Uh,

1048
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,260
so they,
the British government does a census,

1049
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:08,080
you know,
and,

1050
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:10,170
and they,
they asked people's religions as part of

1051
00:49:10,171 --> 00:49:11,490
it.
And in the last census,

1052
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:15,000
remarkably only 55 percent of the people
said they were Christian church,

1053
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:20,060
Church of England,
which was one of the lowest ever but 

1054
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:20,060
fun.
They went to those 55 percent people.

1055
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,210
They did a survey of those and they 
said,

1056
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,620
okay,
why do you call yourself Christian?

1057
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:25,320
Do you believe in the Virgin birth?
Do you believe in transubstantiation?

1058
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:26,250
Do believe in,
you know,

1059
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,930
and went down the list and people say,
no,

1060
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:28,350
no,
no,

1061
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:28,830
no,
no.

1062
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,650
And then they'd ask,
why do you call yourself Christian?

1063
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:36,650
And the answer was,
we'd like to think of ourselves as good 

1064
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:36,650
people,
so religion is usurped,

1065
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:41,561
morality,
and somehow people throw out all of the 

1066
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,780
evil and it's not just the old 
testament.

1067
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,050
No one talks about hell more than Jesus 
Christ.

1068
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,820
Okay?
Jesus guy is supposed to love.

1069
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:52,821
Everyone talked about hell.
This eternal damnation for people who 

1070
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:52,821
disobey,
as,

1071
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:54,420
as,
as Christopher hitchins used to say,

1072
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:59,630
God is like a cosmic Saddam Hussein,
but worse because Saddam Hussein was 

1073
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,380
just torture his enemies while they're 
alive,

1074
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:03,770
God has worse.
He takes the people that I was liking,

1075
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,540
torches them from all eternity.
Who wants such a God?

1076
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,310
What an awful disgusting idea.
My wife bought the sauna thing.

1077
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,380
You don't want to thing.

1078
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:17,380
It's like a sauna suit.
You Zip it up and you hit these buttons 

1079
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,890
and it heats it up and heats your body 
temperature up neat.

1080
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:23,950
And it comes from China and it has this 
hilarious instruction manual because 

1081
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:26,960
it's translated from Chinese to English 
by people that are not.

1082
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:27,720
I love.

1083
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,810
Every time I read one of those manuals,
I love him.

1084
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,900
It's unbelievable.
It's like make waste of body,

1085
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,600
go away,
excels to fat,

1086
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:38,180
disappear like very,
very strange stuff.

1087
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,860
And she was laughing and she was 
reading.

1088
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:40,880
She handed it to me and I go,
well,

1089
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:45,881
this is the problem with the Bible.
One of the big problems in the Bible is 

1090
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:46,770
translating from ancient Hebrew and 
Aramaic.

1091
00:50:46,771 --> 00:50:49,130
And some cases we have not even hit the 
Dead Sea Scrolls,

1092
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,820
but ancient Hebrew,
the letters doubled his numbers.

1093
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,880
So there was no number.
So when the letter a is the number one 

1094
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,370
and words also had numerical

1095
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,780
value.
And when you think about,

1096
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:00,650
I mean,
and this is,

1097
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,030
if you've ever actually ever looked at 
this,

1098
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:04,100
and it's amazing.
So people say the Bible,

1099
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:05,450
you know,
it's just the word of God.

1100
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,700
But then realize that this came by.
In fact,

1101
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:12,810
the King James version was decided by a 
bunch of people who decided what to 

1102
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,160
throw out.
There were parts of the of their earlier

1103
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,500
Bible they didn't like.
They threw out.

1104
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:20,090
They determined what is now the Old 
Testament in the King James version,

1105
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,460
which was a bunch of people who got 
together

1106
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,450
and decided to throw things out and how 
to translate things and what to do.

1107
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,480
It was people just the word of God.
It's a bunch of a bunch of people.

1108
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,000
Have you ever heard of John Marco 
Allegro?

1109
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,410
Mm.
Well,

1110
00:51:33,411 --> 00:51:34,940
I know a lot of people that want to 
grow,

1111
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:38,960
but grow is one of the scholars that was
a.

1112
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:44,080
He was one of the people that was 
deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls and he 

1113
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,330
wrote a book in the 19 seventies called 
the sacred mushroom and the cross.

1114
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:52,360
Oh,
I've heard of the book is his 

1115
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,710
determination after 14 years of 
deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls at the 

1116
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,251
entire Christian religion was a massive 
misunderstanding that it was really all 

1117
00:51:57,251 --> 00:51:57,530
about consumption of psychedelic 
mushrooms.

1118
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,210
Fertility cults.
Yeah.

1119
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:00,680
I've heard that.
I'm skeptical of that,

1120
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:02,030
I should say,
but I'm skeptical of everything.

1121
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,380
It's fascinating.
It's fascinating.

1122
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:06,320
There are a lot of people who have 
written really interesting books.

1123
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:07,440
On the early history of,
of,

1124
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:09,970
of the Christian religion and Judaism 
and I,

1125
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:14,971
you know,
I know a number of those scholars that 

1126
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:14,971
it's really fascinating.
In fact,

1127
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:17,830
there's really great evidence that Jesus
wasn't even divide in the early 

1128
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:17,830
Christian,
right?

1129
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,910
Mean his divinity came about 300 layers 
later.

1130
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,700
It's some really interesting work and,
and so,

1131
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:27,980
uh,
religion is evolved and we now take it 

1132
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,721
as if it was sort of was obvious.
Apparently according to the books I've 

1133
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:34,760
been reading lately,
there's really good evidence that,

1134
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:39,790
you know,
not only did Jesus never called himself 

1135
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:39,790
God,
his followers never did either.

1136
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:39,890
And,
and the,

1137
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:44,891
and this resurrection thing was put in 
later when people want it to make him 

1138
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:44,891
divine.
Wow.

1139
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:46,910
And so that's fascinating.
Again,

1140
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,370
you could be skeptical about it.
We should be skeptical of everything.

1141
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,820
But what's really amazing,
and this is what bothers me,

1142
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:57,821
I wrote a piece for the New Yorker once.
It said all scientists should be 

1143
00:52:57,821 --> 00:52:57,821
militant atheist.

1144
00:52:57,821 --> 00:52:59,420
Yeah.
You were really criticized for that.

1145
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,560
Well,
I by some,

1146
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:02,930
by some people and the first praised by 
others.

1147
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:03,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

1148
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,190
But the real point is that people 
criticized me,

1149
00:53:05,191 --> 00:53:10,191
never read the piece,
which often happens for my work because 

1150
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:11,100
there was the title and the editor chose
the title,

1151
00:53:11,101 --> 00:53:12,990
which is fine,
but I wasn't.

1152
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,250
But what I said was when I simply asked 
the question,

1153
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,280
could it be that Jesus was.
You know what I just said,

1154
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:25,310
could it be that Jesus wasn't always 
considered divine in the Christian 

1155
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:25,310
religion?
You know,

1156
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,040
a scholarly question.
When asked the question,

1157
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,740
in many cases,
I'm called a militant atheist.

1158
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:32,880
How dare you question our doctrine?
And I said,

1159
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:37,020
if nothing should be,
should be above questioning,

1160
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,470
nothing should in our society,
nothing should be sacred.

1161
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:45,620
Everything should be open to question.
So if simply questioning makes me a 

1162
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:50,241
militant atheist than all scientists 
should be melted atheist because we 

1163
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:52,110
should adore questioning.
And so I wasn't arguing,

1164
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,260
you know,
we should be handing out pamphlets and I

1165
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:58,800
said we should be asking questions.
And so the discussion you and I just had

1166
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:04,100
would be viewed by some people and will 
be viewed by some people as sinful 

1167
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,450
sacrilege.
A sacrilege should not be on the air,

1168
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:11,570
should not be allowed to have that 
discussion because how dare we 

1169
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:15,020
questioned the divinity of Jesus Christ 
because after all he was God and to 

1170
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,750
question his divinity is to,
is to do the work of the devil,

1171
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:23,640
and that's so sad because you know you 
should be questioning

1172
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,760
and it is fascinating where people draw 
that line to whether they draw the line 

1173
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,181
at the new testament or whether they go 
back to the old testament or whether 

1174
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:32,181
they even bought.
I mean,

1175
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:34,380
how many people are believers in the 
Dead Sea Scrolls?

1176
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:39,560
I mean,
how many people have gone over the work 

1177
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,140
from Iran with a fine tooth comb?
Exactly,

1178
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:41,640
but by the way,
I don't like the word believer.

1179
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:45,260
I should say that I use it as well.
I think if you're a scientist,

1180
00:54:45,261 --> 00:54:48,440
you'd never use the word belief.
Something's likely or unlikely,

1181
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:53,930
but that belief is not a part of the of.
If you really want to think of rational 

1182
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:53,930
inquiry,
of course you can have.

1183
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,400
We all are colloquium.
We all have beliefs,

1184
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:57,830
which means we have preconceptions,
but,

1185
00:54:57,831 --> 00:55:02,831
but really what we're saying is this is 
highly likely based on what I think or 

1186
00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:03,110
what I know before and,
and

1187
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,080
learn something.
Does it make it more or less likely or I

1188
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:08,600
respect that,
but if you're a Ta,

1189
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,030
I use the word belief all the time,
but I try not to.

1190
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:13,010
Okay.
It's one of those things like the word,

1191
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:18,011
like I try not to use like in sentences 
because people like use it like way too 

1192
00:55:18,011 --> 00:55:18,670
much.
I just got to be a way.

1193
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,570
If you go to high school now,
fucking kids.

1194
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,370
Yeah.
Um,

1195
00:55:21,371 --> 00:55:26,371
but it's,
it is strange to me that people do draw 

1196
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:27,800
those arbitrary lines and when they 
decide that doctrine is real,

1197
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:32,820
like they'll tell you,
if you start talking to him about the 

1198
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,140
Old Testament and they're trying to be a
Christian apologist,

1199
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:33,470
they'll say,
well,

1200
00:55:33,471 --> 00:55:38,471
we'll listen.
You're talking about the old testament 

1201
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:38,471
and we don't go by that.
We go by that thing.

1202
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:42,340
That emperor of Rome created with a 
bunch of bishops and he wasn't even 

1203
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:42,770
Christian himself until he was on his 
deathbed.

1204
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,510
Well,
you know exactly and people,

1205
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:46,600
but people like to define themselves 
and,

1206
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,520
and I don't want to,
you know,

1207
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,190
it sounds patronizing as if,
oh,

1208
00:55:49,191 --> 00:55:50,090
I'm,
you know,

1209
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,100
we're better.
We all believe crazy things.

1210
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:54,110
You and I also did.
We all were crazy leads.

1211
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,220
You believe 10 in.
Well,

1212
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:57,080
here's the,
here's what we all believe in impossible

1213
00:55:57,081 --> 00:56:02,081
things before we get up for breakfast as
Lewis Carroll would you say you believe 

1214
00:56:02,081 --> 00:56:02,990
that you'd like to do is carol are a big
proponent of acid?

1215
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:07,940
Probably when he wrote it may be maybe 
there's lots of things,

1216
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,190
but it doesn't matter.
The idea is interesting.

1217
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:13,310
We all,
humans are not rational beings.

1218
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:16,770
In order to make it through the day we 
convince ourself of 10 impossible things

1219
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,100
might be that you love your wife.
It might be that you like your job,

1220
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,970
it might be what if you do love,
you live what you do,

1221
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:22,960
love your wife,
Lynn.

1222
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,920
You do love your jobs.

1223
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,150
It,
that's not impossible,

1224
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:26,470
but there are other things that you may 
find.

1225
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,800
You may find you.
You could pick it.

1226
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:30,540
You know what I mean?
You know,

1227
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,820
you might find that you,
that,

1228
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:34,780
that I don't,
but do you believe anything weird?

1229
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,330
I'm sure I do.
But you.

1230
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:42,331
Do you ever explore it?
Of course I try some of the things I 

1231
00:56:42,331 --> 00:56:42,331
probably,
I'm a human being so,

1232
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,540
so I make it through the day.
Um,

1233
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:48,160
I may convince myself I'm interesting.
Interesting.

1234
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,390
Well that's nice but,
but,

1235
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,420
but you know,
I thought you were interesting before I 

1236
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:54,420
met you and now you've confirmed it.
Oh good.

1237
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:54,420
I was going to say,
now I know,

1238
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:56,830
but,
but,

1239
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,850
but you know,
I,

1240
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:03,210
let me put it this way,
make convincing myself I'm handsome and 

1241
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:03,870
sexy and whatever it is that we all 
convince ourselves with one of you,

1242
00:57:03,871 --> 00:57:05,800
if you were in a room full of 100 year 
old dudes,

1243
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,210
you'd be handsome and sexy but it.

1244
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:12,230
But exactly.
But if I'm in a room full of maybe not 

1245
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,920
100 year old dudes,
I may not have issues,

1246
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,430
but no,
but bunch of male models.

1247
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,690
So we don't have issues.
We say,

1248
00:57:16,691 --> 00:57:17,530
oh yeah,
those male models.

1249
00:57:17,531 --> 00:57:20,230
But they looked like,
but that's great.

1250
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,030
That's great.
If you have your eyes wide open.

1251
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:27,031
If you're,
if you're comfortable enough in the 

1252
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:27,031
world's going to end,
hopefully part of growing up,

1253
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:31,710
part of becoming an adult is learning 
that a lot of the ridiculous notions we 

1254
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,660
had are just that and getting 
comfortable with that.

1255
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,960
That's part of maturing I think so when 
we were now more comfortable in our own 

1256
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,120
skin,
we're able to accept those,

1257
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:44,350
but I bet when you were a teenager you 
would have had a harder time saying,

1258
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:49,810
you know,
all those other guys are better looking 

1259
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:49,810
and more interesting than me.
For sure.

1260
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:49,810
Okay.
And so,

1261
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:54,480
so that's part of growing up and that's 
what science helps civilization do is 

1262
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:54,970
grow up.
That's a good point.

1263
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:55,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

1264
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:02,730
Boy,
do you think that any of those bizarre 

1265
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,250
beliefs are important at all to people 
today?

1266
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:08,251
Or do you think,
how do you think society would function 

1267
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,981
if we all abandoned religion and what 
about the people that have included it 

1268
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:12,160
as part of the sort of,
again,

1269
00:58:12,161 --> 00:58:17,161
the scaffolding,
how they operate and this level who do 

1270
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:19,951
good things,
who there are people who are more 

1271
00:58:19,951 --> 00:58:20,290
generous and give to charity because of 
religion and help their neighbors and,

1272
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,420
and go to,
you know,

1273
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,280
at Christmas time go to soup kitchens 
and all that.

1274
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,320
There's no doubt that that happened.
And they generally do genuinely do 

1275
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:28,490
experience positive results from 
solutely.

1276
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,750
Absolutely.
So it's not as if religion breeds 

1277
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,150
badness in everyone,
but what people should realize,

1278
00:58:34,151 --> 00:58:37,180
it's not as if the lack of religion 
breeds badness is everyone.

1279
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,100
The question is,
is it necessary?

1280
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,260
Right?
Altruism and kindness can exist on their

1281
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:42,190
own.
Exactly.

1282
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:45,190
So when,
so you can do all of that.

1283
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:46,930
And I know people who go to soup 
kitchens at Christmas,

1284
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:50,440
I'm who are atheists.
The point is it's not necessary.

1285
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:55,330
So for some people it helps.
I would argue that on average,

1286
00:58:55,331 --> 00:59:00,331
and this is where you can have a debate,
but on average I would say the net 

1287
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:02,800
effect of religion is negative and I 
know colleagues of mine who some of whom

1288
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:07,801
would disagree with me in that,
but I think if you look at the net 

1289
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:09,931
effect of religion on society and the 
current world and maybe even over human 

1290
00:59:09,931 --> 00:59:13,951
history,
the net effect is is is negative and I 

1291
00:59:13,951 --> 00:59:16,750
would argue you could probably get many 
of the same features if we dispense with

1292
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:21,780
religion right now,
it'd be a problem because right now for 

1293
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,151
many people,
religion gives them a sense of 

1294
00:59:24,151 --> 00:59:27,191
community,
of sense of belonging and maybe for a 

1295
00:59:27,191 --> 00:59:29,870
sense of of of comfort it and death and 
all sorts of things,

1296
00:59:29,871 --> 00:59:31,540
so we couldn't just sort of it.

1297
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,190
It provides useful things.
As I said before,

1298
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,740
it fulfills evolutionary purposes.
If it wasn't,

1299
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:40,850
it wouldn't be so ubiquitous,
but I can imagine at least a world where

1300
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:44,360
we could fulfill those things in other 
ways.

1301
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:45,640
For example,
instead of picking,

1302
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,320
bringing people together for church 
every Sunday,

1303
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:50,420
we could bring them together for a rock 
concert every Sunday.

1304
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:55,890
Okay,
and they'd get the same sense committee 

1305
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:55,890
or maybe for quantum mechanics class 
every Sunday,

1306
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,400
but maybe they might find it fun if it 
was we made a quantum leap,

1307
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:03,520
but they'd find a central or maybe 
they'd find a sense of community and 

1308
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,461
everyone rolling their eyes just like 
you did now because I suspect that 

1309
01:00:06,461 --> 01:00:06,500
happens in church a lot too.
For sure.

1310
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:11,610
Will sunset sense of community is very 
important to bond people and bring them 

1311
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:11,610
together and religion does it?
Yes,

1312
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,580
but,
but the point is what bothers me is when

1313
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:14,090
people say,
well,

1314
01:00:14,091 --> 01:00:17,510
therefore we need religion and the and 
the answers may be now,

1315
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:22,070
but could we imagine building a sense of
community because we care about our each

1316
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:24,230
other and we have a commonality in other
ways.

1317
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,480
That's another thing that makes science 
so wonderful,

1318
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,910
right?
I've called the large Hadron Collider,

1319
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:33,911
the Gothic Cathedral,
a 21st century because the gothic 

1320
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:35,450
cathedrals were built in the 11th or 
twelfth century by thousands of artisans

1321
01:00:35,451 --> 01:00:38,810
over centuries working together.
They had different languages,

1322
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,960
different cultures,
different religions may be not so many 

1323
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:43,960
different religions back then,
but they work together.

1324
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,000
This large Hadron collider is built by 
10,000

1325
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:50,450
scientists from over 100 different 
countries with different languages,

1326
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:52,670
different religions.
They're working together.

1327
01:00:52,671 --> 01:00:56,810
They have a commonality science really 
much more effectively than religion.

1328
01:00:56,811 --> 01:01:01,730
I would argue binds people globally 
because religions are still an US versus

1329
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:03,110
them thing.
I'm Christian,

1330
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:04,890
you're a Jew.
I'm Christian or Islam or you know,

1331
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:05,870
whatever it is.
I'm Buddhist.

1332
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:10,940
It's always us.
Versus them was science in principle.

1333
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:16,210
It's anyone can do it and,
and we're all working towards a common 

1334
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:18,911
goal,
which is to understand how the universe 

1335
01:01:18,911 --> 01:01:18,911
works.

1336
01:01:18,911 --> 01:01:19,060
It we're not,
we're not interested in,

1337
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:24,380
in,
in pushing our own picture or joining 

1338
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,311
together to believe anything.
That's the other thing people think of 

1339
01:01:27,311 --> 01:01:27,311
is,
Oh,

1340
01:01:27,311 --> 01:01:28,370
you know,
scientists push evolution because we all

1341
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:31,490
get together and at night and with 
special rings and talk to each other,

1342
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:33,860
say we don't want wanna,
we don't want to believe anything else.

1343
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,690
They don't realize if you're a 
scientist,

1344
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:41,170
the biggest way to become famous and 
what we all do when we go into work 

1345
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:44,501
every day is try and prove our 
colleagues wrong because that's how you 

1346
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:44,780
really make progress.
Hey,

1347
01:01:44,781 --> 01:01:47,930
something we thought was right is really
not what we thought it was.

1348
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,480
Those are the great discoveries that 
push people forward.

1349
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,060
So it's not as if we all buy into the 
same thing.

1350
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,340
We're all trying to push knowledge 
forward,

1351
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,360
which means we're trying to discover 
perhaps old biases and,

1352
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,400
and overcome them.

1353
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,810
And so scientists are bound together not
to push their own.

1354
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,910
I mean,
of course we all have theories,

1355
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,880
but we're all willing to throw them out 
if the,

1356
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:14,910
if,
if the theories are proven wrong and 

1357
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:14,910
we're all willing to celebrate being 
wrong.

1358
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,180
And,
and that's a wonderful thing.

1359
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:17,550
And I,
I,

1360
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:21,770
as I always,
if you're a theoretical physicist to two

1361
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:25,140
favorite states to be enter either wrong
or confused because that's great because

1362
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,160
then you're going to learn something 
and,

1363
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,730
and if we are more comfortable with not 
knowing,

1364
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,810
which is the other aspect,
I think that science for many people is,

1365
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:37,850
is terrifying because if you're,
if you're deeply believe you know the 

1366
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:41,571
answers,
if you believe really believe there's a 

1367
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:41,571
god you can,
you can put aside that uncertainty.

1368
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:43,380
And for many people,
uncertainty is terrifying,

1369
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:49,040
but be comfortable with not knowing is 
wonderful and moreover I would argue is 

1370
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,270
better for teachers and for parents.

1371
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:56,630
You know,
your kids ask you questions and you 

1372
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,630
really want to always give them the 
answer whether you know it or not,

1373
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,380
but it'd be much better to say,
you know what?

1374
01:02:58,381 --> 01:03:01,500
I don't know.
Let's figure out if anyone knows this.

1375
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,170
Because then they participate in the joy
of discovery.

1376
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:05,970
They're not told something by some 
authority.

1377
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,240
And same with teachers.
I do think we should be teaching 

1378
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,211
questions rather than answers.
We should be teaching kids how to 

1379
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:14,310
question and then how to search for the 
answers,

1380
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,550
how to distinguish the wheat from the 
chaff out,

1381
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,450
how to distinguish the nonsense from the
sense,

1382
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,460
especially in our society right now.
We used to,

1383
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:24,660
we used to teach school is if it's just 
a composite story of information,

1384
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:28,950
now we know why I have in my phone.
I have more information than in school,

1385
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:30,450
but also have more misinformation.

1386
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,510
How do I tell the difference if the 
process and that's it.

1387
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:36,510
That's what we need to teach in school.
The process of skeptical inquiry,

1388
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,690
relying on evidence,
checking many sources,

1389
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,320
testing your ideas constantly.
Then we teach.

1390
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,360
Those are the tools kids need to to deal
effectively in the modern world with a,

1391
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:52,580
with an internet that's full of and and 
with new sources which are equally full 

1392
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:56,241
of misinformation as well as information
and one of the biggest issues I think 

1393
01:03:56,241 --> 01:03:59,361
that people are having with religion in 
the 21st century is these areas where 

1394
01:03:59,361 --> 01:04:01,380
you're not allowed to question and 
explore that things hit.

1395
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:05,550
These walls were this is God's will and 
this is the way it is.

1396
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:08,610
And in my mind,
what we say that is just code word for,

1397
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,040
I don't want to think about it.
It's too confusing.

1398
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,830
It's too complicated,
too terrifying to terrifying and,

1399
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:16,560
and that and,
or people say,

1400
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:17,950
and this amazes me,
people,

1401
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,410
I get people,
religious people saying,

1402
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,140
you will never understand the origin 
years.

1403
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,400
You'll never understand what love is.
Science will never ever explained love.

1404
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,710
Science will never ever explained x or 
will.

1405
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:33,180
And then I say,
well that's incredibly pompous statement

1406
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,940
because if you say that science will 
never explain this,

1407
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,750
you must understand it because how do 
you know that will never explain it?

1408
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:42,990
We never know what we won't be able to 
explain until we try.

1409
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:46,200
And maybe there are things about our 
universe that will never understand,

1410
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:51,740
but we don't know until we try.
You can never say upfront that science 

1411
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,060
will never explain this or that because 
you haven't tried.

1412
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,750
And in my experience as a scientist,
I've been,

1413
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,340
you know,
I,

1414
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:03,650
there could have been brick walls but 
I've watched progressively those brick 

1415
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,790
walls crumble as we move around them or 
we break them.

1416
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,240
And it is so exhilarating.
And that's why it's the greatest story 

1417
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:11,360
ever told.
It's so exhilarating to see them knocked

1418
01:05:11,361 --> 01:05:13,950
down and things you thought we'd never 
understand.

1419
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,840
Or I remember one of the forces of 
nature,

1420
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:20,950
a very prominent physicists,
the 19 sixties or early 19 actually in 

1421
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:25,800
[inaudible],
69 said it will be a hundred years 

1422
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:25,800
before we discover,
understand this interaction.

1423
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:30,090
Next year the theory came out and it's 
so wonderful to see how the story 

1424
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:35,040
surmounts the biases and the 
anticipation of individual scientists.

1425
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,500
That's the greatest story ever told so 
far.

1426
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,680
Well,
what's ridiculous about saying no one 

1427
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,601
will ever figure anything out is that 
what we figured out over the last 200 

1428
01:05:45,601 --> 01:05:49,291
years is monumental.
And then human language has only been 

1429
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:49,940
around for 40,000.
Absolutely.

1430
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,660
We live another 50,000
years.

1431
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:53,680
100,000
years.

1432
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:57,120
As long as we don't.
As long as we keep open inquiry.

1433
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,470
You could imagine moving.
I mean,

1434
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:03,710
look,
we went through a few hundred years of 

1435
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,391
the Middle Ages where the incredible 
inquiry based civil culture of the 

1436
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:10,180
Greeks was just forgotten.
I'm,

1437
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,400
you know,
the Greeks had determined the 

1438
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:15,400
circumference of the earth.
Not only that it was round,

1439
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,001
but what its circumference was by simple
measurements that were van not accepted 

1440
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:21,600
because of dogma.
So we have to,

1441
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:24,750
if we want to progress,
we have to be aware of dogma.

1442
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,620
How did they figure out the 
circumference of the earth?

1443
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:31,621
So it's really neat.
I think it was an aerostar guess I 

1444
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:31,621
forgot.
What year was the Greek.

1445
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:32,730
Now it's amazing what he said was,
look,

1446
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,440
so at a certain time of day,
in a certain time of the year,

1447
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:40,470
the sun is directly overhead at 12 noon.
Okay.

1448
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,880
And in my.

1449
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:47,030
So.
And I can tell that by looking down a 

1450
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:48,891
deep well,
and I see the reflection of the sun 

1451
01:06:48,891 --> 01:06:48,891
exactly in that deep well,
okay.

1452
01:06:48,891 --> 01:06:53,330
So the race and the sun which are coming
down in the same direction towards the 

1453
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:56,001
earth.
Everywhere it comes down to the deep 

1454
01:06:56,001 --> 01:06:57,951
well,
but a hundred miles away the well 

1455
01:06:57,951 --> 01:07:00,410
because the surface is curved,
the well is pointing a little bit 

1456
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:03,890
different direction.
So the sun's rays come at a slightly 

1457
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:05,640
different angle.
So this on this day I will measure that.

1458
01:07:05,641 --> 01:07:09,630
The Sun is directly overhead for me,
but I'll get my friend 100 miles away to

1459
01:07:09,631 --> 01:07:12,420
measure the angle of the sun relative to
the well,

1460
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:17,220
and if you that tells you that the earth
is curved and if you do the geometry,

1461
01:07:17,221 --> 01:07:22,221
you can work out.
If the 100 miles of the earth's surface 

1462
01:07:22,221 --> 01:07:22,590
causes the sun's rays to suddenly be at 
that angle,

1463
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,600
how curved the earth is and what the 
circumference of the earth is.

1464
01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:28,410
It's plain geometry that in principle 
any high school student could do,

1465
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:30,580
but when you say 100 miles away,
first of all,

1466
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:32,560
how are they communicating with this guy
hundred miles away.

1467
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:34,750
They're not immediately,
but the guy writes it down and then they

1468
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:39,770
takes a horse and they come and compare 
notes later and they use a Sundial to 

1469
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:42,931
determine the time,
the Sun Sundial to determine the time 

1470
01:07:42,931 --> 01:07:45,451
and and the 100 miles a minute away.
Would there be a deviation at all in a 

1471
01:07:45,451 --> 01:07:45,490
time,
a minute or two?

1472
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,240
Well that,
yep.

1473
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,370
But so to something accuracy you,
you,

1474
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,290
you,
you get it wrong to some accuracy,

1475
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:55,740
but they did pretty damn well.
They came up with the circumference was 

1476
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,020
darn close to the circumference of the 
earth,

1477
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,890
and so,
uh,

1478
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:02,170
it's amazing that they use these 
techniques so they were just so confused

1479
01:08:02,171 --> 01:08:07,171
and so curious about it all.
They just tried to figure out what it 

1480
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:07,171
has got to be a way to figure this out.
Well,

1481
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:08,520
and they didn't.

1482
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:13,740
They weren't,
they weren't forced with the dogma that 

1483
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:13,740
the earth is flat.
As you,

1484
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:18,560
I've,
I've told today you were dealing with 

1485
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:18,560
people who are still

1486
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,130
forced with that dogma is very strange.
How do you feel about that in 2017?

1487
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:22,190
It's amazing,
but you know,

1488
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:27,191
nothing's surprised.
Not only that gravity is not real and 

1489
01:08:27,191 --> 01:08:27,191
dinosaurs aren't real.
And you,

1490
01:08:27,191 --> 01:08:28,010
the people who say gravity are real.
I have a great solution,

1491
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:33,370
but it's a building.
Walk out the window of the 13th floor 

1492
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:36,551
and test your ideas.
And the great thing is do it before you 

1493
01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:36,560
reproduce,
but it's a magnetism thing.

1494
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:40,060
They believe it's electro magnetism or 
something like that that suddenly people

1495
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,390
down to the.
Yeah,

1496
01:08:41,391 --> 01:08:44,210
that's what I'm thinking.
Think so perinatal magnet and look at it

1497
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:45,710
as what happens as you're falling into 
the earth?

1498
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,690
Well,
it's even more hilarious is that they.

1499
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:53,110
Well,
we talked about this before the podcast 

1500
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:53,110
started,
the Japanese weather satellite.

1501
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:56,510
That takes an image,
a full image of the earth.

1502
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:57,920
What is the name of that satellite 
again,

1503
01:08:57,921 --> 01:08:58,310
Jamie?

1504
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:02,870
It takes a full image of the earth from 
22,000

1505
01:09:02,871 --> 01:09:07,871
miles ago away.
People keep saying in this flat earth 

1506
01:09:07,871 --> 01:09:10,250
theory thing that there's no images of 
the earth in full at.

1507
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:11,840
They're all composites.
That's not true.

1508
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:16,870
It's not true.
There are images of the earth that are 

1509
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,710
taken every 10 minutes by this one 
satellite and they're high resolution.

1510
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,720
You can.
You can access them online anytime you 

1511
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,271
want,
but people see those and they want to 

1512
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:25,550
think they're fake,
but yet they believe there's an ice wall

1513
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:29,990
around Antarctica that you crossover and
you fall to the abyss.

1514
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:33,440
Where's this photo of the ice wall it or
have they never?

1515
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:35,090
Well,
how does someone fly from Japan?

1516
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:37,610
They don't believe that people can fly 
around the world.

1517
01:09:37,611 --> 01:09:39,980
I've done it,
I've done and that they're all lying.

1518
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,580
Here's no one,
have they ever thought at time zones,

1519
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:47,480
why are there times zones of the earth 
says flat where there time zones,

1520
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:52,510
the only reason they're telling me they 
should go from New York to La and see 

1521
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:52,510
you know what?

1522
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:54,020
The time is different.
Do they will know,

1523
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:56,030
but they probably think it's a human 
invention,

1524
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:01,390
but you know the sun is still shining in
la when it's gone down in New York and 

1525
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:03,860
they can call their friends and check 
and if the earth was flat,

1526
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:09,160
that wouldn't be the case.
It's only the case because the earth is 

1527
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:09,160
curved.
I mean,

1528
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,160
so those simple things should should 
convince people,

1529
01:10:10,161 --> 01:10:13,610
but people are willing to throw out 
evidence if they have a belief.

1530
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:18,910
That's really from,
and what I said before is we have to 

1531
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:20,210
realize the easiest person to fool is 
yourself.

1532
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,430
So if you're not willing to question 
your beliefs,

1533
01:10:22,431 --> 01:10:26,900
especially those that you hold 
particularly cherished beliefs in,

1534
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:29,390
if you're not willing to question those,
you're not gonna.

1535
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,190
You're not gonna ever grow.
Yeah,

1536
01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:36,191
well that's a good way to put a 
particularly cherish because I think a 

1537
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:36,191
lot of people do cherish these ideas.

1538
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:40,240
Things like the earth being flat because
it gives them some sort of information 

1539
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,991
leg up on everybody I know.
Something that people don't know what 

1540
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:44,990
makes them feel better about themselves.
They may hate gays because it makes them

1541
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,750
feel better about not being gay or maybe
they are gay,

1542
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,590
but you know what I mean?
You always worry about that.

1543
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,840
And so I,
I think we all,

1544
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:57,680
that's what I mean about being believing
10 impossible things for breakfast.

1545
01:10:57,681 --> 01:11:02,681
We,
I don't want to make fun of people 

1546
01:11:02,681 --> 01:11:02,930
because we all do think of things to 
make us feel better about ourselves.

1547
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:08,260
It's part of being human,
the psychological pitfalls and so we 

1548
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:08,260
should be aware of those and I have them
in.

1549
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,980
You have them and I don't pretend I 
don't.

1550
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:14,010
What I do try and do is question them,
but we can all do that

1551
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,780
and I don't,
I don't.

1552
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,900
I understand why people are beliefs.
Certain things.

1553
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:20,250
It's not.
And you can be.

1554
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:25,890
Again,
Richard Dawkins tells me about an 

1555
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:26,130
astrophysicist he knows who during the 
day,

1556
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,830
you know,
studies objects in the sky and,

1557
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:29,190
and,
and,

1558
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:32,550
and looks at at galaxies or stars and 
measures that they're,

1559
01:11:32,551 --> 01:11:34,710
that they're 12 billion years old or 
whatever,

1560
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:40,010
and then,
but yet he goes home at night and then 

1561
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:40,010
it's an and is convinced that the earth 
is 6,000

1562
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:42,510
years old.
So somehow we can really do both.

1563
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:43,530
Yeah.
He knows a guy like,

1564
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:48,710
oh yeah,
and people can and we're all capable of 

1565
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,370
believing in to mutually contradictory 
things at the same time.

1566
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,640
It's just the way we're built.
And so how does this guy really measure 

1567
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,631
the cause of these planets?
Somehow it doesn't affect his 

1568
01:11:59,631 --> 01:12:02,781
fundamental beliefs and it's amazing.
It's true because we can all believe 

1569
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:03,870
things that are wrong and so it doesn't 
mean they're stupid.

1570
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:09,260
It doesn't mean because this guy is 
apparently a fairly accomplished 

1571
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:09,260
astrophysicist.
It's the psychological pitfalls,

1572
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,730
but we all have trap.
So,

1573
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:12,480
so many people,
you know,

1574
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:17,481
when I talk about this,
I don't want to seem pompous in the 

1575
01:12:17,481 --> 01:12:17,481
sense of saying,
Oh,

1576
01:12:17,481 --> 01:12:20,901
I'm better or scientists are better.
Science is better because science helps 

1577
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:24,300
us overcome those pitfalls.
Why do those pitfalls exists though?

1578
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:29,550
Because because obviously evolution,
I would argue that they have lived in 

1579
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:32,450
evolutionary purpose that somehow they 
allow.

1580
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,260
If they didn't have an evolutionary 
purpose,

1581
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:35,940
then they wouldn't have been selected 
for.

1582
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:36,700
Right?
Right.

1583
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,960
There does seem to be some weird 
inclination or some desire to expose 

1584
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:44,760
secrets to find secrets and did know 
them.

1585
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:46,350
Yeah.
It's nice.

1586
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,390
Well,
but on the other end,

1587
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:49,440
that's great.
Let's exploit that.

1588
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,180
Discovering secrets is about is 
discovering mysteries.

1589
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,920
Discovering mysteries is what motivates 
to do is to do sign,

1590
01:12:56,921 --> 01:12:58,140
so let's put it in a positive light.

1591
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:03,440
We all want to solve puzzles.
We all want to understand something and 

1592
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,180
maybe the first one to understand it.
We all want to access information may be

1593
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:08,360
and make us feel special for doing it.
Really,

1594
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:09,690
that's the reason I do science,
right?

1595
01:13:09,691 --> 01:13:12,460
It's not save the world.
It's because I really wanted to know,

1596
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:13,120
understand.
I mean,

1597
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,780
and it's nice to be the first person to 
maybe understand stuff.

1598
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:20,560
It's gratifying for your ego.
It's a and we are driven by ego and,

1599
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,910
and let's not pretend otherwise.
Right,

1600
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
but you,
I think you're talking about measurable 

1601
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,130
things and elements and things that you 
could sort of expose and explain,

1602
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:34,131
but what these people seem to be really 
obsessed with is people lying about 

1603
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:38,740
stuff and covering up secrets about the 
earth being flat or chem trails.

1604
01:13:38,741 --> 01:13:43,741
Yeah.
They'd like to believe there's a 

1605
01:13:43,741 --> 01:13:43,741
conspiracy.
Conspiracy's are very,

1606
01:13:43,741 --> 01:13:43,860
very attractive.

1607
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:44,770
Yeah.
Because it.

1608
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,870
Because,
and I,

1609
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:46,500
you know,
I don't,

1610
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:50,160
I'm not a psychologist,
so what I say here is just speculation,

1611
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:55,700
but the world doesn't care what you 
believe and it doesn't treat you fairly.

1612
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:57,270
Right?
Right.

1613
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,040
And that's just a fact.
The world,

1614
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,840
he doesn't treat me fairly,
doesn't treat you fairly.

1615
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:03,220
It doesn't give a damn if it's my 
wellbeing or,

1616
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,410
okay,
so,

1617
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:07,980
Hey,
I'm being treated unfairly.

1618
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:12,981
Isn't it better for me to think that 
someone is actively being unfair to me 

1619
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:13,420
than just assume it's just the way it 
is?

1620
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,840
Because then I can blame it.
And so I tend to think conspiracy 

1621
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,360
theorists tend to say,
you know,

1622
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,760
the things I don't like,
there's a real reason for it.

1623
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:24,820
It's not an accident.
It's not just haphazard,

1624
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,250
it's not anything.
And in and it,

1625
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:27,830
you know,
it's,

1626
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:30,910
I've lost my job because there's gotta 
be a reason.

1627
01:14:30,911 --> 01:14:35,911
There's got to be a villain.
There's got to be someone making it 

1628
01:14:35,911 --> 01:14:36,580
happen.
Just like the reason we burned witches.

1629
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:42,090
Right?
Because there were storms or there 

1630
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:42,090
wasn't.
It wasn't crops that year.

1631
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:44,920
And a lot of people say it's an 
interesting historical theory,

1632
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:50,040
which I think is seems quite plausible 
to me that when Newton discovered the 

1633
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:50,560
laws of gravity,
the universal law of gravity,

1634
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,190
it contributed to the ending of the 
burning of witches.

1635
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,010
Well,
I thought that that was a,

1636
01:14:56,011 --> 01:14:58,320
meant the burning of witches.
I thought they drowned them mostly.

1637
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:58,750
Well

1638
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:01,000
had they hung a lot of them too.
They drown them.

1639
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:02,170
Where do.
I don't care whether it's burning.

1640
01:15:02,171 --> 01:15:03,160
They killed her.
I understand.

1641
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:04,990
Okay.
They blamed crops.

1642
01:15:04,991 --> 01:15:09,991
They blamed the bad things.
And then when Newton discovered that 

1643
01:15:09,991 --> 01:15:11,920
even the planets are affected by the 
same laws that Annapolis,

1644
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:17,070
there's a universal laws.
It meant that physical effects had 

1645
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:17,830
physical causes and when bad things 
happen,

1646
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:22,600
there's a physical reason there's not 
someone you can blame and and witches or

1647
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:27,601
whatever.
And so there's a lot of arguments that 

1648
01:15:27,601 --> 01:15:30,151
suggests that that kind of development 
and physics led to the end of blaming 

1649
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:33,460
people for those for bad crops or,
or for bad things happening.

1650
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:35,660
But I think that's the kind of thing 
when we.

1651
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:40,661
We want to find someone to blame rather 
than just saying the universe doesn't 

1652
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:40,661
give a shit

1653
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:43,780
about me and anybody interested in this 
is a really fascinating subject.

1654
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:48,781
But the whole Salem witch trial thing.
Then there's a lot of really convincing 

1655
01:15:48,781 --> 01:15:50,620
evidence that seems to point towards 
ergot poisoning.

1656
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:56,010
That there was some,
a late freeze and that this particular 

1657
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:59,020
type of fungus grew on some of their 
wheat that makes Origami,

1658
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:02,080
which is a very.
Has very lsd like properties.

1659
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:07,081
And they think these people thought they
were being bewitched because they're 

1660
01:16:07,081 --> 01:16:07,081
being contaminated.
It's,

1661
01:16:07,081 --> 01:16:08,560
it's a great idea if the evidence for 
it,

1662
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:10,310
but it's interesting.
I know it is fascinating,

1663
01:16:10,311 --> 01:16:11,110
but let's,
but let's,

1664
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:14,650
can we all I think behind that is,
is uh,

1665
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,000
you know,
we've all had.

1666
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:21,840
I mean,
I think what we're seeing are extremes 

1667
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,501
of characteristics that we all have.
I think many of us assign blame when we 

1668
01:16:26,471 --> 01:16:28,150
shouldn't.
When I lose my keys,

1669
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:29,770
sometimes I see them out.
Where do you put the,

1670
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,600
my wife,
where did you put the keys?

1671
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:36,640
Right?
And then I learned very quickly that I 

1672
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,551
shouldn't have said that.
And so I think it's just an,

1673
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:44,940
it's a characteristic of being human and
accepting it as a characteristic of 

1674
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:45,850
being human.
It doesn't diminish us,

1675
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:50,420
but what's really great is we can 
understand that and try and work and,

1676
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,280
and try and figure out ways to avoid

1677
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:55,280
those pitfalls.
So a lot of these ways of thinking,

1678
01:16:55,281 --> 01:17:00,281
these patterns of thinking,
these are sort of hold offs from the 

1679
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:03,940
ancient days.
That's the things that helped us to 

1680
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:03,940
survive those pathways now are 
counterproductive.

1681
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:08,640
And,
and I ran a meeting at my origins 

1682
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,511
project is about the origins of 
xenophobia and w and w no US versus 

1683
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:15,971
them,
and it turns out there's really useful 

1684
01:17:15,971 --> 01:17:18,440
Zena evolutionary purposes for us versus
them tribal purposes and not just that 

1685
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:24,190
actually it goes back to biochemistry.
Immune systems is us versus them just 

1686
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:25,900
being able to recognize foreign bodies 
and cells.

1687
01:17:25,901 --> 01:17:28,160
So it goes back to single cell 
organisms,

1688
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,530
but then the question is,
is it now got to uh,

1689
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:32,510
uh,
is,

1690
01:17:32,511 --> 01:17:35,440
is,
is it now run its course and become on,

1691
01:17:35,441 --> 01:17:36,790
of course,
to be counterproductive.

1692
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:38,900
Exactly.
And then we have to look at those things

1693
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:41,630
and ask what their is and if we explore 
those things,

1694
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:46,631
then then there's a better chance that 
we can deal with them and asked what's 

1695
01:17:46,631 --> 01:17:51,011
useful and what isn't.
But if we refuse to acknowledge that 

1696
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:53,951
those things exist and that they may be 
the purpose of our religion or our 

1697
01:17:53,951 --> 01:17:56,090
beliefs or whatever,
then we're,

1698
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,190
then we can't possibly overcome them.

1699
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,280
Or You.
I'm going to change gears a little bit.

1700
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:05,060
Are you concerned at all about ai?
Yeah,

1701
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:05,870
we will.
Yes.

1702
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:10,871
We just had a workshop again at my 
origins project in which you can watch 

1703
01:18:10,871 --> 01:18:10,871
it online,
the public event anyway.

1704
01:18:10,871 --> 01:18:11,520
Where can.
Someone said,

1705
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:14,660
Oh wow,
dot origins dot Asu Dot Edu.

1706
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,330
We run these amazing events and what's 
neat to me by the way,

1707
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:20,000
is we get 3000 people attending the pain
to attend.

1708
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:23,690
People really want to hear science if 
it's done right and interestingly.

1709
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,590
That's awesome.
Yeah,

1710
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:25,270
I'm,
I'm.

1711
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:29,780
I'm so pleased and privileged that we,
that people find things that interesting

1712
01:18:29,781 --> 01:18:33,590
and come over and over again,
but so we ran this,

1713
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:37,330
this event called the future of ai who's
in control because associated with.

1714
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:42,360
We had a scientific workshop on what are
the possible disruptive influences of 

1715
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,060
Ai.
Now Ai is gonna change the world.

1716
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:49,090
It's going to.
The future is not going to be like the 

1717
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:51,461
past.
What it means to be human is not going 

1718
01:18:51,461 --> 01:18:51,461
to be like it was the past.
Get over it.

1719
01:18:51,461 --> 01:18:54,650
Now the question is some of those things
which we think are horrible,

1720
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:57,170
may not be so bad.
For example,

1721
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:02,470
the ancient Greeks thought the 
introduction of writing would be 

1722
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:04,130
horrible because oral storytelling would
be destroyed,

1723
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:07,730
but writing wasn't such a bad thing.
It actually made the world kind of maybe

1724
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:10,610
a more interesting place.
It maybe,

1725
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:15,670
maybe ai will take over certain 
functions that humans have teaching or 

1726
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:18,200
doctoring or whatever,
and maybe it won't be so bad.

1727
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,800
Okay.
Maybe it maybe it seems terrifying for 

1728
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:23,800
us,
but maybe won't be so bad.

1729
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,090
On the other hand though,
you can imagine awful consequences,

1730
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:28,090
ones that are already bad.
So we.

1731
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:33,110
We looked at these disruptive possible 
consequences and the point is it can 

1732
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,110
have both.

1733
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,770
What's really important is,
unless you think about it,

1734
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:41,960
pasture said fortune favors the prepared
mind ultimately.

1735
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:45,860
So yes,
Ai is both terrifying and exciting.

1736
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:49,700
The future is terrifying and exciting.
For example,

1737
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:54,701
I'm really excited by the possibility 
that ai might become better physicists 

1738
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,290
in us,
and I'd like to know.

1739
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,450
I'd like to know how intelligent 
computers,

1740
01:19:59,451 --> 01:20:02,600
especially intelligent quantum computers
understand quantum mechanics.

1741
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:05,810
They may understand it better than we do
and I might learn from them.

1742
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,120
So maybe there'll be the dominant 
physicists in the future of the dominant

1743
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:13,620
academics and we can learn from them.
We can learn from intelligent artificial

1744
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:17,130
systems that wouldn't be so bad.
Maybe it seems like it'd be bad,

1745
01:20:17,131 --> 01:20:22,131
but what's wrong with that?
It's really rose colored glasses though 

1746
01:20:22,131 --> 01:20:22,131
what that,
that may be.

1747
01:20:22,131 --> 01:20:24,740
But on the other hand,
it could be that,

1748
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,170
that,
that,

1749
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:29,370
that intelligent is ai decides that 
there's no need.

1750
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:31,200
For example,
here's something that,

1751
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:34,710
that one of the people who was at our 
workshop and Yon Tallen who,

1752
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:39,920
who founded skype was one of the 
coordinators of our workshop and he 

1753
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:39,920
says,
well,

1754
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,030
you know,
oxygen is really bad for,

1755
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,190
for,
uh,

1756
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,730
oxidation of,
of,

1757
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,330
uh,
of,

1758
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,310
of uh,
electronic systems.

1759
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:50,820
Okay?
So if ai could control,

1760
01:20:50,821 --> 01:20:52,950
you know,
a technology,

1761
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,880
they might want to systematically reduce
the oxygen content of the atmosphere,

1762
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,670
right?
That wouldn't be so good for humanity.

1763
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:05,030
Okay.
So you can imagine the other extreme 

1764
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,861
where basically intelligent ai systems 
control most of the technology in the 

1765
01:21:06,861 --> 01:21:08,550
world and maneuver things.
So humans become extinct.

1766
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,460
So you can,
you can imagine one realm or the other,

1767
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,760
but unless you think about the ways that
you can try and and ensure that the 

1768
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:23,241
future is as good as can be,
you've got to at least confront those 

1769
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:23,241
possibilities.

1770
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:24,960
You don't put your head in the sand and 
you don't go,

1771
01:21:24,961 --> 01:21:26,220
oh my God,
the world is ending.

1772
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:27,360
You say,
look,

1773
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,250
this is going to.
There are changes are going to happen.

1774
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:34,251
For example,
Ai will displace millions of people from

1775
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:36,390
their work.
You know,

1776
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:36,700
the,
the,

1777
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:38,880
there's no doubt if not billions,
if billions.

1778
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,470
Let's say billions.
Now,

1779
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,330
what's that going to do?
Well,

1780
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:47,331
there are two.
There are two possibilities and one of 

1781
01:21:47,331 --> 01:21:48,981
them was imagined by John Maynard Keynes
when he thought about what 

1782
01:21:48,981 --> 01:21:48,981
industrialization would do.
He said,

1783
01:21:48,981 --> 01:21:53,570
you know,
the effects of it is that machines are 

1784
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:53,570
going to do a lot of the work that 
people are going to do.

1785
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:54,750
But the great thing is that'll free 
people from the work.

1786
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,790
There'll be able to go have coffee and 
coffee shops,

1787
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:59,730
go see read books,
do you know see plays.

1788
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:01,770
The quality of their life will improve.

1789
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:04,550
But of course that didn't happen because
you know,

1790
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,560
the,
the increased resources that were 

1791
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:09,560
decreased,
increased money and,

1792
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:09,560
and,
and,

1793
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,910
and all of that that was generated by 
industrialization wasn't,

1794
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:16,740
wasn't uniformly distributed at some 
point when we are billions of people out

1795
01:22:16,741 --> 01:22:17,940
of work,
we're going to have to decide to say,

1796
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:18,420
you know,
what,

1797
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:24,080
those machines that produced a higher 
net quality potential quality of life 

1798
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,010
for everyone.
Maybe we have to spread the wealth,

1799
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,210
maybe some sort of universal basic 
income.

1800
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:33,320
And I think frankly,
we have a choice either we as machines 

1801
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,101
begin to do just that.
We have a choice to move in that 

1802
01:22:37,101 --> 01:22:37,101
direction.
It seems to me.

1803
01:22:37,101 --> 01:22:40,470
Or we have a choice to move in a 
direction of incredible socio economic,

1804
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,590
uh,
problems and Tom Moulton and,

1805
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,660
and,
and that's going to create huge,

1806
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:49,950
huge societal problems.
And I'm worried that in our society,

1807
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:54,951
for example,
that doesn't even want to provide 

1808
01:22:54,951 --> 01:22:56,160
healthcare to everyone where some people
say,

1809
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:58,140
why should I pay for you when you're 
sick?

1810
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:02,100
Even though we live in a society that's 
wealthy enough to do just that,

1811
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:04,320
that will never get to a point where we 
say,

1812
01:23:04,321 --> 01:23:07,510
you know what,
these machines have generated incredible

1813
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:12,511
wealth.
Let's allow all the people who've been 

1814
01:23:12,511 --> 01:23:13,090
displaced to to,
to benefit from that wealth.

1815
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,100
I suspect that won't happen,
and I,

1816
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:15,490
I,
I,

1817
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,800
I'm,
I'm pessimistic about the future.

1818
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:20,350
Otherwise my friend Cormac McCarthy 
says,

1819
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:23,710
because he's a really chipper fellow,
but he writes very dark books and when I

1820
01:23:23,711 --> 01:23:26,300
first met him I said,
how can you be so cheerful?

1821
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:26,890
And he said,
you know,

1822
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:32,670
I'm a pessimist,
but that's no reason to be gloomy and 

1823
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:35,020
that's become my mantra ever since then.
That's a great statement.

1824
01:23:35,021 --> 01:23:35,620
Yeah,
I love it.

1825
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:41,010
Now,
what I'm worried about with ai is that 

1826
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:41,440
we're looking at it as if it's an 
invention.

1827
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,350
It's a human invention,
which most certainly is,

1828
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,360
but it's also a life form.

1829
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:48,580
What I'm worried about is that it 
decides,

1830
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:49,480
well,
eventually,

1831
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:51,220
if you extrapolate,
yeah,

1832
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,540
but okay,
so big deal.

1833
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,990
Well that it decides to make a better 
version of itself.

1834
01:23:55,991 --> 01:23:58,840
Then it continues to do that and we're 
going to be completely obsolete within a

1835
01:23:58,841 --> 01:23:59,820
shorter amount of time.
Great.

1836
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:01,060
Really?
Well,

1837
01:24:01,061 --> 01:24:02,860
I mean no law,
so that's could be good or bad.

1838
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:07,861
So it's to this note,
but this is your illusion that you're 

1839
01:24:07,861 --> 01:24:07,890
significant with.
No,

1840
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,110
I'm not,
it's not.

1841
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:11,860
It just stay alive long enough to die of
old age,

1842
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,760
but maybe eaten by robots.
So there's lots of things that,

1843
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,920
that don't have any real purpose.
But what would the robots,

1844
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:19,900
you know,
if you want to go with robots,

1845
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:25,230
would it be and why would they feel it's
necessary to destroy us?

1846
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,510
Because we're polluting the environment 
we made.

1847
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:29,860
We made your world.
Well,

1848
01:24:29,861 --> 01:24:31,750
not when we're,
when we're not governing things.

1849
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,100
We might not be,
you know,

1850
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:36,020
we might want to say they might want to 
save us like we do the turtles and,

1851
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:41,710
or you know,
in various places they don't want the 

1852
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:41,710
lights to happen because the turtles 
don't.

1853
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:41,710
Don't,
you know,

1854
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:46,050
mate,
if the lights are on the beach and we 

1855
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:46,050
don't do such a good job of,
we don't,

1856
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:46,050
but there'll be better than us.
Right?

1857
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:50,910
Right.
But what we might be an evil hyena like 

1858
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:50,910
species,
if we are,

1859
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:52,210
then why should we be around?
That's a good question.

1860
01:24:52,211 --> 01:24:54,220
But I mean I'm worried about that.
Well no,

1861
01:24:54,221 --> 01:24:56,260
but maybe give us a chance to get 
better,

1862
01:24:56,261 --> 01:25:00,820
but maybe you could view them as your 
offspring and then you then,

1863
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:03,700
then you say,
look at my offspring.

1864
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:06,460
And in fact actually I do think 
ultimately if,

1865
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,310
if,
if,

1866
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:12,450
if machines can,
can program themselves and ultimately 

1867
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:13,510
come better than it will be difficult 
for biology to keep up.

1868
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:18,720
And our future is humans will be,
could easily be what you would call the 

1869
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,981
Borg in Star Trek.
Could easily say the only sensible ways 

1870
01:25:22,981 --> 01:25:22,981
to merge.
Right?

1871
01:25:22,981 --> 01:25:22,981
And,
and,

1872
01:25:22,981 --> 01:25:23,530
and you know,
what's really interesting.

1873
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:26,140
So then the dominant life form,
it'll be really interesting.

1874
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:31,410
So we tend to think of why,
why are carbon based individuals that 

1875
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:34,590
dominant life form in the universe.
But it could be if we're looking at the 

1876
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,280
out in the universe of looking at the 
dominant life form their silicon based,

1877
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:38,320
they're not carbon based and,
and,

1878
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:39,230
and,
and,

1879
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:44,250
and it'd really be interesting because 
in this case it would be intelligent 

1880
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:47,431
design.
You can imagine a bunch of intelligent 

1881
01:25:47,431 --> 01:25:47,740
computers having a podcast in the far 
future.

1882
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:48,800
So,
you know,

1883
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:54,150
I think we were designed by these,
by these monkeys and they would be 

1884
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:56,280
right.
Yeah.

1885
01:25:56,330 --> 01:26:00,400
That's what's really fascinating is the 
idea that we are some sort of a,

1886
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:04,490
not just a creator,
but that we're the predecessors

1887
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:05,930
of some greater species

1888
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,580
and who,
who knows who knows what the is going to

1889
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:09,220
be.
But,

1890
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:13,120
but to be afraid of the future,
it's inevitable.

1891
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:16,330
Ultimately what can happen will happen,
will happen.

1892
01:26:16,331 --> 01:26:18,510
We just have to accept that and we have 
to try and,

1893
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:23,920
and,
and prepare for it as best as possible 

1894
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:24,490
to try to make sure it works out as well
as possible.

1895
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,880
I begin this book,
the greatest story ever told so far with

1896
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,470
the,
of a quote from,

1897
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,720
from Virgil,
from the idea saying the.

1898
01:26:31,721 --> 01:26:33,560
I think these are the tiers of things in
there.

1899
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:35,210
I should,
you know,

1900
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:36,560
I don't know if you have a copy of the 
book around.

1901
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:41,390
I was going to bring my name,
but I'm sure you'd have with you anyway,

1902
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,410
and the stuff of our mortality costs us 
to the heart.

1903
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,700
That's a Latin phrase that people 
remember that famous,

1904
01:26:48,701 --> 01:26:50,300
but the next phrase in the night and 
eight,

1905
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:54,010
which I talked about,
the very last page or two of the book is

1906
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:58,150
this phase release your fear and I think
that's the important thing,

1907
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:00,580
that stuff overall mortality does cause 
us to the heart,

1908
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:05,940
but release your fear,
use it to make our brief moment in the 

1909
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:05,940
sun more precious,

1910
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:10,830
but it's fascinating to me that we're so
connected to this particular form that 

1911
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:12,060
we find ourselves in now and that we 
were.

1912
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:15,940
We're so attached to it and that even 
though we know that we are a finite life

1913
01:27:15,941 --> 01:27:17,770
form as individuals.
Some people don't.

1914
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:20,220
Yeah,
go on what I'm saying irrationally,

1915
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:22,450
but we know that we're a finite life 
form.

1916
01:27:22,451 --> 01:27:26,620
We would like to think that we stay in 
this state for as long as

1917
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,750
history and we would like to wait,
but you know,

1918
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:31,940
but of course we're just temporary.
We've run as humans,

1919
01:27:31,941 --> 01:27:34,850
even that's almonds.
Homo sapiens have only been around for a

1920
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:36,770
Spec of time,
a couple hundred thousand years.

1921
01:27:36,771 --> 01:27:41,771
Right?
And who would expect our future to be 

1922
01:27:41,771 --> 01:27:41,771
the same,
but yeah,

1923
01:27:41,771 --> 01:27:41,771
of course it can be.
And,

1924
01:27:41,771 --> 01:27:43,040
and what if,
what if,

1925
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:49,720
what if?
The things that are wonderful about our 

1926
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:49,720
culture are preserved by our 
descendants,

1927
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,220
but our descendants aren't carbon based.
Okay.

1928
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,590
So what's wrong with that?
Why do you,

1929
01:27:54,591 --> 01:27:56,300
why do you care if your great,
great,

1930
01:27:56,301 --> 01:27:56,750
great,
great,

1931
01:27:56,751 --> 01:27:57,200
great,
great,

1932
01:27:57,201 --> 01:27:57,620
great,
great,

1933
01:27:57,621 --> 01:27:59,810
great,
great grandchildren look like you,

1934
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,160
right?
I mean,

1935
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:03,520
of course we all do because we want 
somebody mortality.

1936
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:04,370
Right?
Okay.

1937
01:28:04,371 --> 01:28:06,170
So the robots are made to look like you.
I mean,

1938
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:06,980
I don't care,
you know,

1939
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:12,140
they all have Joe Rogan faces on them in
front of them or did you see x Makena?

1940
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:12,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

1941
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:17,890
And Yeah,
and I've talked to Alex Garland who was 

1942
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:18,940
a hesitation there.
There was a little nod and you know,

1943
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:20,450
as,
when I,

1944
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:25,510
when I,
of course whenever I see science 

1945
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:25,510
fiction,
I,

1946
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:25,620
I try to suspend disbelief.
Okay.

1947
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:27,860
I think the idea,
in fact,

1948
01:28:27,861 --> 01:28:31,550
I showed a clip from smacna in our event
because,

1949
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:36,790
uh,
because I think there are many possible 

1950
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:36,790
negative consequences of,
of,

1951
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:40,130
of artificial intelligence.
One of them is malevolence,

1952
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:43,100
but the other is unintended negative 
consequences.

1953
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:47,630
And I thought Max Malkin it was,
it was a wonderful example of unintended

1954
01:28:47,631 --> 01:28:49,730
negative consequences of artificial 
intelligence.

1955
01:28:49,731 --> 01:28:53,870
I don't think that lovely young woman 
was designed to be evil,

1956
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:59,110
but it was an unintended consequence 
when she saw an opportunity for herself 

1957
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:01,010
and the other one I showed,
of course it's from 2001 a space.

1958
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,390
The great how warehouses.
Sorry Dave,

1959
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:04,120
I can't do that.

1960
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:05,340
And,
and,

1961
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:07,080
and,
and I think,

1962
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:12,300
uh,
I think it's wonderful and thoughtful 

1963
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:12,300
and it was thought provoking.
And I,

1964
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:12,510
and as I say it,
I've come to know Alex Garland who wrote

1965
01:29:12,511 --> 01:29:15,540
it and directed as innocent and,
and he's a very thoughtful,

1966
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:17,610
interesting guy and one of my favorite 
all time movies.

1967
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:18,190
I love that.
Yeah,

1968
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:19,890
it's a really interesting movie.
I agree.

1969
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:22,290
Uh,
I always,

1970
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,680
I always try and analyze it afterwards 
and sometimes as a scientist I,

1971
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:26,550
I,
I,

1972
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:32,420
I try not to get in the way of liking 
science fiction because of course they 

1973
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:34,800
all involve suspending disbelief and 
certain things in.

1974
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:39,980
And the difference between good science 
fiction and bad science fiction is not 

1975
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:43,340
how scientifically accurate it is.
It's how good a story it is because if 

1976
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:44,190
it's a good story,
you can suspend disbelief easily.

1977
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:49,500
Uh,
someone was asking me the other day on 

1978
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,341
a,
on a science fiction podcast where it 

1979
01:29:51,341 --> 01:29:51,341
said,
you know,

1980
01:29:51,341 --> 01:29:51,700
what's the worst example of this?
And,

1981
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:53,610
and,
and the example that comes to mind is,

1982
01:29:53,611 --> 01:29:58,611
I remember in New York Times reporter 
after the physics of Star Trek came out 

1983
01:29:58,611 --> 01:30:02,820
said,
can I go with you to a science fiction 

1984
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:02,820
movie and watch you and then talk to you
about it?

1985
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:06,750
And so we went to see a starship 
troopers and this is the stupidest movie

1986
01:30:06,751 --> 01:30:08,670
of all time because.
Well,

1987
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:09,630
because they're,
you know,

1988
01:30:09,631 --> 01:30:11,100
because,
because you know,

1989
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:14,490
these,
these ants poop out things at supersonic

1990
01:30:14,491 --> 01:30:16,560
speeds about cross the galaxy.
I mean,

1991
01:30:16,561 --> 01:30:17,490
you know,
that's amazing,

1992
01:30:17,491 --> 01:30:18,180
but it's stupid.

1993
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,660
What's a very campy movie,
right?

1994
01:30:21,661 --> 01:30:22,020
Yeah,
I know,

1995
01:30:22,021 --> 01:30:27,021
but when the problem is,
because he was asking me to look at the 

1996
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:30,231
reality of.
I couldn't even suspend disbelief if I 

1997
01:30:30,231 --> 01:30:30,231
want it to,
but that.

1998
01:30:30,231 --> 01:30:30,690
But it's things like that.
For example,

1999
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:37,190
when something happens,
it's suddenly takes you out of the 

2000
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:37,190
story.
You suddenly go,

2001
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:37,350
Oh shit,
here's another one,

2002
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:39,770
another movie I hate called ghost,
maybe liked it with,

2003
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:45,080
you know,
the family more Demi Moore and what's 

2004
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:45,080
his face?
Right.

2005
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:45,390
And here's the idea.
So this guy's a ghost,

2006
01:30:45,391 --> 01:30:46,110
right?
And he,

2007
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:46,970
he,
he,

2008
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:49,340
he wants to show his long lost love 
leads around.

2009
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:50,430
It's beautiful.
It's wonderful.

2010
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,830
So he tries to lift a penny,
but of course it goes through his hands,

2011
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:54,000
right?
He tries to hug her,

2012
01:30:54,001 --> 01:30:59,001
but it's hands go right to her.
But you noticed each time he stands on 

2013
01:30:59,001 --> 01:30:59,001
the floor,
sits on the couch.

2014
01:30:59,001 --> 01:30:59,850
He stands on the floor and sits on the 
couch.

2015
01:30:59,851 --> 01:31:04,851
So his butt or his feet have some 
incredible ability to be stopped by 

2016
01:31:04,851 --> 01:31:04,851
matter,
but nothing else does.

2017
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,350
I mean,
I saw that the rest of the movie went.

2018
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,950
That's a good point.
I didn't even think about it now.

2019
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,460
I didn't want to ruin it for you,
but I just.

2020
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:14,210
Well,
I saw it when I was like 10 older.

2021
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:15,930
It's an older movie.
How old?

2022
01:31:15,931 --> 01:31:17,430
When is that movie?
I probably wasn't 10.

2023
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:18,700
I was probably 20 or something.
Yeah,

2024
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:20,850
well I'm older.
It's a stupid movie.

2025
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:21,540
It is.
It is.

2026
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:21,930
But,
but,

2027
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:24,300
but for that,
what I'm saying is the minute I saw that

2028
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,160
it was hard for me to enjoy the rest of 
the movie.

2029
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:29,100
Plus they have an unhealed bit,
which also sounds stupid.

2030
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:33,600
So sometimes,
sometimes,

2031
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:36,130
sometimes something like that when 
you're in.

2032
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:38,970
It doesn't have to be science,
it can be watching a drama and you say,

2033
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,130
why the hell did they do that?

2034
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:43,070
It's just how to share Sheriff Dermot.
Yeah,

2035
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,010
yeah,
yeah.

2036
01:31:44,011 --> 01:31:49,011
And then.
And then it's hard for you to enjoy the 

2037
01:31:49,011 --> 01:31:49,011
rest of the movie.
Yeah,

2038
01:31:49,011 --> 01:31:49,230
I find that all the time.
I have a real issue with that.

2039
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:54,740
Um,
when you think about artificial 

2040
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:58,191
intelligence,
do you consider like one of the things 

2041
01:31:58,191 --> 01:31:59,830
that freaks me out is that what we 
consider life will,

2042
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,850
when we think about instincts and needs 
and desires,

2043
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:09,750
those won't necessarily be programmed at
all into any artificial life.

2044
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,980
Well,
one of the questions that arises,

2045
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:16,981
and this is a huge point of discussion 
among ai researchers because I've been 

2046
01:32:16,981 --> 01:32:17,920
to a bunch of meetings in preparation 
for our meeting is whether,

2047
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:23,530
and I find the statement almost vacuous,
but I'm amazed that they use it all the 

2048
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:24,790
time to program machines with human 
values,

2049
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:26,950
right?
Why would we be programming?

2050
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,650
And my problem is what our human values.

2051
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,180
And they said,
well,

2052
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,920
one of the,
it was a very smart guy and I won't,

2053
01:32:32,921 --> 01:32:34,780
I won't say who said this meeting.
Well,

2054
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:36,670
they just have to watch us.
And I said,

2055
01:32:36,671 --> 01:32:37,840
what do you mean they watched Donald 
Trump?

2056
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:39,340
And they know what human values are.
I mean,

2057
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:44,650
come on,
I'm not sure there are universal human 

2058
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:45,640
values and so.
So how do we program them in.

2059
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:49,000
But neverless the question is do we want
to align their programming?

2060
01:32:49,001 --> 01:32:54,001
In what way?
In terms of what we think will be 

2061
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:54,001
beneficial to us,
right?

2062
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:54,980
Because after all we're programming 
them,

2063
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:58,540
so we do do we in part St [inaudible] 
values?

2064
01:32:58,930 --> 01:32:59,860
Who knows?
I mean,

2065
01:32:59,861 --> 01:33:03,640
I find that a very interesting question 
and a very difficult one to resolve.

2066
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:08,140
I my own feeling is if it were up to me 
and I am not,

2067
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,970
it's not an area of active research for 
me.

2068
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:12,220
You produce the smartest machines you 
can.

2069
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:15,280
Just like you have kids.
I have kids.

2070
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,620
Do we want them to believe everything we
believe?

2071
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:18,490
No.
We want to give them.

2072
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:23,670
We want them to become the most capable 
human beings they can be so that they 

2073
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:24,010
can go out and do the best stuff.
Right?

2074
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:27,370
So why is it different for computer?
I'd want to make the most capable,

2075
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,460
intelligent,
resourceful machine I ever could because

2076
01:33:30,461 --> 01:33:34,000
then I,
at least all the evidence suggests to me

2077
01:33:34,001 --> 01:33:35,710
that that machine will make the best 
decisions.

2078
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:41,280
All right?
But if the machine doesn't have an 

2079
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,381
ability to breed sexually and if it 
doesn't have ego and if it doesn't 

2080
01:33:43,381 --> 01:33:46,240
necessarily have creativity because it 
doesn't need to be praised for its ego,

2081
01:33:46,241 --> 01:33:51,241
I don't think we,
I don't think creativity comes from 

2082
01:33:51,241 --> 01:33:51,241
needing to be praised for you.
I think creative,

2083
01:33:51,241 --> 01:33:53,950
I mean as another great intrinsic 
aspects of human beings that makes being

2084
01:33:53,951 --> 01:33:55,360
a human being worth being human being.

2085
01:33:55,420 --> 01:34:00,420
Well I think I agree with you,
but I think if you're going to connect 

2086
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:03,310
that sort of mindset to a computer or to
artificial intelligence,

2087
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,320
don't you think it would have some need 
to create like what?

2088
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:11,330
What is our need to create as like we 
like to express ourselves to other 

2089
01:34:11,330 --> 01:34:11,350
people.
If you were alone on an island,

2090
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:12,730
do you think it would create?
Yeah,

2091
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:14,560
sure.
Here's of yourself forever.

2092
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:17,930
You think you would paint on?
I'd like to think I would because I.

2093
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:21,430
because I kind of.
Because that's what I find gratifying.

2094
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:26,460
But I think one of the things people 
find gratifying is it that other people 

2095
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:26,460
are enjoying it.
So no,

2096
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,540
I don't do science because other people 
enjoy it.

2097
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:28,990
And do science because I enjoyed.
And,

2098
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,880
and um,
and so you think you would do science if

2099
01:34:30,881 --> 01:34:32,020
you were the last person on earth?

2100
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:35,440
You would be alone with what I do.
The work I do is,

2101
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:37,120
I mean I don't want to make any 
pretense.

2102
01:34:37,121 --> 01:34:40,330
I do it because it's fun for me and I 
think most people do it.

2103
01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:44,800
They may claim actually I shouldn't say 
there are people probably better than me

2104
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:50,040
who do what they do because they're 
constantly trying to save humanity in 

2105
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,701
one way or another.
I like to think what I do has a net 

2106
01:34:53,701 --> 01:34:56,491
positive effect and I try to take time 
out of my science to try and counter 

2107
01:34:56,491 --> 01:35:00,631
things that I think are wrong with the 
world because I have a cause because of 

2108
01:35:00,631 --> 01:35:00,650
my background and also because I have a 
soapbox.

2109
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:03,560
I'm lucky enough to have people listen 
to me for one reason or another.

2110
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,960
So I try to take that responsibility 
seriously.

2111
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:08,690
But on the whole I do what I do because 
I enjoy doing it.

2112
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:13,690
I think most of us do and we only do it.
We're only good at it if we're good at 

2113
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:15,860
it because we enjoy it and look at,
here's an example,

2114
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:21,010
so the best one of the best machine 
learning machines and existence just 

2115
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:24,150
beat the best go player in the world.
Right?

2116
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:25,370
Right.
How to do it.

2117
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:26,690
It learned,
constantly.

2118
01:35:26,691 --> 01:35:28,370
Learn,
taught itself to you better go,

2119
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:31,610
okay,
that's creativity if you want.

2120
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:33,980
It's trying to be better at playing the 
game,

2121
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,690
but didn't I just calculate every single
note?

2122
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,810
No,
no,

2123
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:39,710
no.
It can't.

2124
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:45,010
It can't do that.
What it can do is try to teach itself 

2125
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:47,411
strategies that work and just creativity
and look at it and it does teach itself 

2126
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:52,850
strategies at work,
new strategies by looking at old 

2127
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:52,970
strategies that didn't work.
That's creativity.

2128
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:56,330
I mean who knows how to define 
creativity in all senses,

2129
01:35:56,570 --> 01:36:01,570
but you can imagine that a sufficiently 
intelligent computer would be creative 

2130
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:02,210
because in order to do physics and 
science,

2131
01:36:02,211 --> 01:36:02,830
you need to be creative.

2132
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:03,440
You know?
In fact,

2133
01:36:03,441 --> 01:36:05,700
I was just.
I just did an event with Alan all day in

2134
01:36:05,701 --> 01:36:08,130
New York City and I all the from Mash.
Yeah.

2135
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,400
Yeah.
Who's a great guy at intelligent man and

2136
01:36:10,401 --> 01:36:12,350
very interesting science and science 
communication.

2137
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:17,590
We've done a few events together.
One with my origins project we can see 

2138
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:20,910
online,
so he was interviewing me or we had a 

2139
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:20,910
dialogue,
but he was interviewing me about the new

2140
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:22,070
book and and,
and,

2141
01:36:22,130 --> 01:36:24,200
and in the context of that and science 
communication.

2142
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:28,760
And he said something wonderful both 
there in earlier he said,

2143
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:32,570
because it's so counter intuitive to 
modern culture's reception.

2144
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:36,260
He said,
art requires rigor.

2145
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:40,250
Science requires creativity.
And I thought,

2146
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:42,050
wow,
because that's the opposite of what most

2147
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:43,670
people think,
but in fact,

2148
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:45,140
science,
art requires rigor.

2149
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:47,440
You gotta just get just the right colors
and,

2150
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:52,610
and,
and work really hard to get the right 

2151
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:52,610
patterns.

2152
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:52,760
Whether that art is music or you know,
buy art.

2153
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:57,780
I'm looking very broadly.
Whereas to do science makes progress 

2154
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:58,010
because we're creative.
It's also rigorous,

2155
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:01,650
but people somehow have this artsy 
fartsy notion that oh,

2156
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:03,860
artists are creative and scientists are 
nerds.

2157
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:04,670
You know,
they're just,

2158
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:07,400
they're just rigorous.
Science is just rigorous garbage.

2159
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:09,410
It's not,
it's creative.

2160
01:37:09,710 --> 01:37:13,130
Just like art and art is rigorous.
And the scientists who say,

2161
01:37:13,131 --> 01:37:14,090
oh,
these artists,

2162
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:15,470
these musicians,
they're not,

2163
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:20,740
they're not as good as we are,
they're equally bad because the art and 

2164
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,640
doing anything well requires rigor,
discipline,

2165
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:24,260
effort,
and rigor.

2166
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,600
And I think that that beautiful 
dichotomy,

2167
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:31,740
that juxtaposition of art and rigor and 
science and creativity is something 

2168
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:35,921
wonderful that Alan said and,
and we should realize that it's a 

2169
01:37:35,921 --> 01:37:36,950
characteristic science is,
does involve creativity and rigor,

2170
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:41,920
but so does all the areas of human 
activity that make the,

2171
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:43,700
the story of humans so wonderful.

2172
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:46,310
That's why it's the greatest story ever 
told so far.

2173
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:47,210
Well,
many,

2174
01:37:47,211 --> 01:37:51,170
many aspects of human life require 
creativity.

2175
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:54,310
Many endeavors right here and right.
Whether you're a better kickboxer,

2176
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:59,340
I mean,
there's a lot of creativity and 

2177
01:37:59,340 --> 01:37:59,340
fighting,
eager to learn rules.

2178
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:04,270
Sure.
Discipline your muscles over and over 

2179
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:04,270
again.
Any sportsperson and maybe there's even,

2180
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:05,400
maybe there's even creativity and 
football,

2181
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,180
but,
uh,

2182
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:07,460
uh,
you know,

2183
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:12,461
there's Gregor and creativity and 
anything that humans push to the limits.

2184
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:13,350
Yeah,
no,

2185
01:38:13,351 --> 01:38:15,870
I absolutely agree.
The question would be,

2186
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:20,550
what would the motivation of artificial 
intelligence be if it's not,

2187
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:25,820
if it doesn't have any.
We were essentially riding on the 

2188
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,890
motivations of our ancient genetics.
We want to have sex for gas.

2189
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:31,050
Exactly,
and it'd be interesting to see those.

2190
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:32,550
What would it be interesting to find 
out,

2191
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:33,090
right?
Well,

2192
01:38:33,091 --> 01:38:36,690
what would their motivation to be 
creative because because we've.

2193
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:41,900
We've developed in them problem solving 
capabilities and because they're self 

2194
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:44,220
aware and the amount of asked questions 
because they're self aware.

2195
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:46,290
They may want to improve their 
understanding of the world.

2196
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:51,380
Partly for technology.
They may want to make the world better 

2197
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:51,930
for themselves.
All sorts of reasons,

2198
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:53,370
but we'll,
we'll see.

2199
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,440
Have to some extent will import it,
it programming,

2200
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,800
but to some extent we'll see and to some
people that's terrifying that we won't 

2201
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,700
know the motivations.
Of course not as terrified about it.

2202
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:07,760
I guess I'm concerned that we got to 
make sure we understand what we're doing

2203
01:39:08,081 --> 01:39:13,081
at each step so we don't produce massive
negative results that could have been 

2204
01:39:13,081 --> 01:39:16,170
avoided,
but I'm not as concerned that the future

2205
01:39:16,171 --> 01:39:19,020
will be different than the past.
I hope it is.

2206
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,560
When you see some of the emerging 
technologies like Crispr,

2207
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:30,800
some of these genetic engineering 
technologies where they're starting to 

2208
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,290
use non-viable human fetuses and run 
some tests on them,

2209
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:36,900
are you concerned at all about that?
Are you concerned about,

2210
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:42,170
or I shouldn't need to use this term,
the term concern because obviously 

2211
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:42,170
you're obviously mindset.
No,

2212
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:42,490
no,
no,

2213
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,130
no.
I'm concerned has happened.

2214
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:44,760
No,
no.

2215
01:39:44,761 --> 01:39:45,900
It's not.
Just let things happen.

2216
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:51,390
Let Watch what's going to happen.
Trying to anticipate the results,

2217
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:56,900
understand them in detail,
anticipate what the results are and 

2218
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:57,240
avoid negative ones to the extent you 
can,

2219
01:39:57,690 --> 01:39:59,820
but it's life is all about the things 
are going to change,

2220
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:02,280
but to accept the fact that things are 
gonna change and if and,

2221
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:04,610
and that's not,
that's,

2222
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:09,670
that's why aren't we happy that the 
world is different than it was during 

2223
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:09,670
medieval times.
I mean,

2224
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:14,390
except for you know,
Mike Pence and other people with the 

2225
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:18,351
rest of us are happy or you know,
that can pick a lot of radio 

2226
01:40:18,351 --> 01:40:18,870
commentators,
but most of us are happy that we,

2227
01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:21,780
that the world has gotten more open,
more interesting.

2228
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:27,020
And so that's part of the human drama is
that it's going to go places and we 

2229
01:40:27,451 --> 01:40:29,550
don't know where it's going to go and 
that's okay,

2230
01:40:29,551 --> 01:40:34,551
but we should all work as much as we can
to try and make sure to the extent that 

2231
01:40:34,551 --> 01:40:38,721
we can,
that the direction of heads is a good 

2232
01:40:38,721 --> 01:40:38,721
one is,
is beneficial,

2233
01:40:38,721 --> 01:40:38,850
more interesting,
more exciting,

2234
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:43,500
more possibilities,
more fun for everybody and,

2235
01:40:43,501 --> 01:40:48,501
and maybe even more sustainable because 
it seems reasonable that it should be 

2236
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:52,041
sustainable if we think we care about 
not just our children but our 

2237
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:55,461
grandchildren and their grandchildren.
And so that it's self interest in some 

2238
01:40:55,461 --> 01:40:55,461
sense,
you know,

2239
01:40:55,461 --> 01:40:59,890
to be interested in,
in conservation and sustainability 

2240
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:00,790
instead of immediate profit.
If you really have,

2241
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,330
of course,
you know,

2242
01:41:01,331 --> 01:41:04,690
might say if I amass enough wealth and 
my children will be fine forever and who

2243
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:06,940
gives a damn about the rest of the 
people's children.

2244
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:12,420
But you know,
we can decide that maybe it's in the 

2245
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:15,721
best interests of everyone.
If humans societies sustainable because 

2246
01:41:15,721 --> 01:41:17,380
there'll be less likelihood for extreme,
more extreme violence,

2247
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:17,620
blah,
blah,

2248
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:18,010
blah.
You can.

2249
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:23,460
I would argue that we behave well in 
large part because of reason and and and

2250
01:41:24,461 --> 01:41:25,570
my point is,
and I've had this,

2251
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:30,640
we had a session in my origins project,
a whole meeting on the origins of 

2252
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:34,441
morality and and I've had this debate 
with a number of colleagues who point 

2253
01:41:34,441 --> 01:41:37,921
out,
I think it was hume who said you can't 

2254
01:41:37,921 --> 01:41:39,481
get ought from is okay,
you can't get off from it is just by 

2255
01:41:39,481 --> 01:41:40,540
rationality.
You can't decide how to behave.

2256
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:42,070
Maybe,
maybe,

2257
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:47,100
but here's the point without,
is you can never get to ot without 

2258
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,330
knowing the consequences of your 
actions,

2259
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:53,680
which is what science is all about.
You can't decide what's good and bad and

2260
01:41:53,681 --> 01:41:58,681
so science and reason is an essential 
part of any progress because we can't 

2261
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:04,981
possibly decide what economic policies 
to enact or what or what social policies

2262
01:42:05,591 --> 01:42:10,591
are,
what technological policies if we don't 

2263
01:42:10,591 --> 01:42:10,591
know the consequences of actions.
That's why,

2264
01:42:10,591 --> 01:42:11,800
for example,
here's an example.

2265
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:16,801
It was so stupid for the Republicans to 
design this healthcare policy and 

2266
01:42:16,801 --> 01:42:19,180
promoted before anyone in analyzed say 
the economic impact of it.

2267
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:21,580
I mean,
they could have still decided to do it.

2268
01:42:21,581 --> 01:42:26,581
It's not as if but,
but at least that data would have been 

2269
01:42:26,581 --> 01:42:28,840
useful for making a final decision.
It's that simple.

2270
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:35,880
What?
I guess getting back to that crispr 

2271
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,311
thing,
if that becomes available and if it 

2272
01:42:38,311 --> 01:42:42,630
advances to the point where it's 
available to people that are alive 

2273
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:42,630
today,
would would you,

2274
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:46,800
would you give it a shot?
Would you change anything about 

2275
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:46,800
yourself?
Would you become thor?

2276
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,170
I mean if it really gets to that point 
where we can worry about a lot of 

2277
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:54,241
things,
but I'm not anywhere near as worried 

2278
01:42:54,241 --> 01:42:54,241
about that as am hacking.
Right?

2279
01:42:54,241 --> 01:42:58,350
Right.
Because if we can hack computers and if 

2280
01:42:58,350 --> 01:42:58,350
you can hack the DNA as a lot of kids 
want to do.

2281
01:42:58,350 --> 01:42:59,770
In fact,
I was told years ago,

2282
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:02,650
I'm chairman of the board of something 
called the bulletin of atomic scientists

2283
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:07,950
that have the board of sponsors that 
sets the doomsday clock every year and 

2284
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:08,260
so we have to think about existential 
threats to mankind.

2285
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:09,850
I remember about seven or eight years 
ago,

2286
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:13,330
we had a,
a fresher from mit who said his computer

2287
01:43:13,331 --> 01:43:15,670
science students were most interested in
hacking DNA.

2288
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,730
Much more interested than hacking 
because it's just an attitude,

2289
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:23,820
it's just a code and and so if you could
manipulate arbitrarily in a very precise

2290
01:43:24,161 --> 01:43:24,970
way,
DNA,

2291
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,600
then of course there are many good 
things that can come and maybe you can 

2292
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:30,600
make yourself stronger,
bigger,

2293
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:31,530
whatever you want.
Maybe we're not you,

2294
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:32,710
maybe your children,
whatever,

2295
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,050
and maybe you can overcome genetic 
diseases,

2296
01:43:35,051 --> 01:43:38,470
which of course would be great,
but you can also with,

2297
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:43,620
you know,
with great power comes great 

2298
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:45,031
responsibility.
And with that you can also imagine 

2299
01:43:45,031 --> 01:43:45,031
hacking,
right?

2300
01:43:45,031 --> 01:43:45,640
And creating new viruses or whatever you
want.

2301
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:47,080
And so yeah,
it's,

2302
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:52,140
it's any new technology is terrifying.
Does mean we shouldn't create new 

2303
01:43:52,161 --> 01:43:53,120
technologies.
I mean,

2304
01:43:53,121 --> 01:43:55,050
cars are terrifying.
Cars kill.

2305
01:43:55,051 --> 01:43:58,100
Look how many people cars get killed now
maybe we'll have self driving cars.

2306
01:43:58,101 --> 01:44:03,101
Maybe fewer people die.
Some people are afraid of self driving 

2307
01:44:03,101 --> 01:44:06,041
cars because they do present moral 
problems and it's as if a car is 

2308
01:44:06,041 --> 01:44:10,661
designed to minimize the number of 
people it kills and it can do that by 

2309
01:44:10,661 --> 01:44:14,591
killing you.
If you're faced with running into five 

2310
01:44:14,591 --> 01:44:15,020
school children or the car turning and 
hitting a wall,

2311
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:18,510
what do you want your car program to do?
And it's,

2312
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,960
these are fascinating questions we will 
have to address,

2313
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:26,380
but technology can,
so technology can be used in many ways 

2314
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:27,420
and it's terrifying.
But uh,

2315
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:32,120
it's trite to use this old expression,
but I do think of it at times,

2316
01:44:32,121 --> 01:44:35,530
which is that the little thing I gave 
him a stepdaughter once,

2317
01:44:35,531 --> 01:44:40,531
it said ships are safe in the harbor,
but that's not what ships are meant to 

2318
01:44:40,531 --> 01:44:40,531
do.

2319
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:43,760
I mean,
if you can,

2320
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:49,150
you can bury your head in the sand.
You can never go outside the house for 

2321
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:51,290
fear of being run over by a car or being
embarrassed or whatever.

2322
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:55,280
Or you can choose to live a life.
It's your choice.

2323
01:44:55,730 --> 01:45:00,730
But to me,
living the life as it is more 

2324
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:00,730
interesting.
That's why it in,

2325
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:01,240
in,
in the,

2326
01:45:01,241 --> 01:45:04,820
in the book I point out you can choose 
how to look at the world.

2327
01:45:04,821 --> 01:45:09,821
You can choose to say you're the center 
of the universe and if that makes you 

2328
01:45:09,821 --> 01:45:09,821
feel better finding the universe was 
created for you,

2329
01:45:09,821 --> 01:45:14,410
or you can choose to let your beliefs 
conform to the evidence of reality and 

2330
01:45:14,410 --> 01:45:17,090
go and assume the universe exists in 
evolved independent of your existence,

2331
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:20,090
and in that case you're bound to be 
surprised.

2332
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:25,450
Isn't it better to be able to have a 
life full of surprises and a life that 

2333
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:25,450
doesn't have any?

2334
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:25,450
No.
It's a wonderful philosophy.

2335
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:30,600
What I'm thinking is I'm wondering about
these technological advancements when it

2336
01:45:30,601 --> 01:45:35,601
comes to the ability to manipulate the 
human body and when they get to the 

2337
01:45:35,601 --> 01:45:39,111
point where we,
we don't have the same issues that we 

2338
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:42,141
have today with diseases and when 
injuries or even with a biological 

2339
01:45:42,141 --> 01:45:43,830
inferiorities with everyone.
Looks like Lebron James.

2340
01:45:43,831 --> 01:45:44,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

2341
01:45:44,221 --> 01:45:44,550
Okay.

2342
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:47,180
You could imagine that's the case.
I,

2343
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:52,900
I,
I suspect people will want different 

2344
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:52,900
things,
but okay.

2345
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:54,710
That'll be a very different world,
but look at this way.

2346
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,440
Um,
you're a pretty buff guy.

2347
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:59,150
Okay.
You manipulated your body,

2348
01:45:59,240 --> 01:45:59,870
right?
Yes.

2349
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:00,980
Okay.
What's wrong with that?

2350
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:02,180
No,
nothing,

2351
01:46:02,181 --> 01:46:03,920
but I'm still five foot eight.
Okay.

2352
01:46:04,110 --> 01:46:06,770
Lebron James is seven feet tall and 
manipulated his body.

2353
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:09,500
It's a very different deal.
Someone gives me a seven foot tall pill.

2354
01:46:09,501 --> 01:46:10,270
I might take it.
Yeah,

2355
01:46:10,271 --> 01:46:12,890
but you manipulate your body given the 
technology of the time.

2356
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:13,810
Right,
but you did what?

2357
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:18,820
You do changes and everyone can seven 
feet tall and it was at worse because 

2358
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:20,210
you can manipulate because you know 
enough physiology now or whatever.

2359
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:25,270
Exercise physiology that you can 
manipulate your body more efficiently 

2360
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:28,511
now than you could before and people can
run faster miles or jump higher because 

2361
01:46:29,001 --> 01:46:32,360
we've been sports for forever and so 
that's okay.

2362
01:46:32,361 --> 01:46:33,300
You know,
that's fine.

2363
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:36,230
I'm just wondered what your thoughts are
on the future.

2364
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:39,080
Well,
I physiological imbalance.

2365
01:46:39,081 --> 01:46:41,140
I try to anticipate the abilities

2366
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:46,140
and to the extent I can discuss what 
they are so that we as a society could 

2367
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:48,220
address them more cogently.
I do not.

2368
01:46:48,221 --> 01:46:53,221
However,
generally predictions about anything 

2369
01:46:53,221 --> 01:46:53,221
less than 2 trillion years in the 
future.

2370
01:46:56,790 --> 01:47:01,790
That's a great quote.
What's going to happen 2 trillion years 

2371
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:02,940
when the universe expanding to the point
of cooling off and everything dies.

2372
01:47:02,941 --> 01:47:06,210
There's two reasons for that statement.
One is it's pretty simple.

2373
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:11,211
When you start thinking about the 
longterm is the universe is probably 

2374
01:47:11,211 --> 01:47:11,211
going to expand forever,
all the galaxies,

2375
01:47:11,211 --> 01:47:11,211
and if it doesn't,
the sun's burning out.

2376
01:47:11,211 --> 01:47:12,720
Anyway,
point is if it doesn't do that,

2377
01:47:12,721 --> 01:47:14,820
no one's gonna know I was wrong.
That's a good point.

2378
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:16,580
That's a very good point.
Yeah,

2379
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,700
so yeah,
so that's why.

2380
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:19,710
Yeah,
that's my general.

2381
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:24,890
I've read a quote once about 
supermassive black holes that has 

2382
01:47:24,890 --> 01:47:26,220
matched with my brain ever since I read 
it.

2383
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:31,300
Okay,
and the quote was that inside every 

2384
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:35,181
galaxy is a supermassive black hole 
that's one half of one percent of the 

2385
01:47:35,181 --> 01:47:39,411
mass of the galaxy and that it's very 
possible that inside that supermassive 

2386
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:42,960
black hole is a whole nother universe.
Well,

2387
01:47:42,961 --> 01:47:44,760
the up to up to that,
what does that mean?

2388
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:46,450
Up to that point?
Everything's fine.

2389
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,760
Everything sounded fine.
Okay.

2390
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:52,850
It is true that it's amazing that most 
galaxies that we can measure have large 

2391
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:53,980
black holes on center,
which leads to an inch.

2392
01:47:53,981 --> 01:47:55,200
The question we don't have the answer 
to,

2393
01:47:55,290 --> 01:48:00,290
right?
One of the reasons we're building the 

2394
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:00,290
James Webb space telescope.
The James,

2395
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:03,291
what James Webb Space Telescope.
The one that's going to replace the 

2396
01:48:03,291 --> 01:48:03,291
Hubble space colors that.
Is that going to be in space?

2397
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:03,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

2398
01:48:03,691 --> 01:48:08,691
It's going to be much further orbit.
It's going to be launched next year and 

2399
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:12,711
it's the.
It's the successor to James Webb is 

2400
01:48:12,711 --> 01:48:12,711
going to be 100 times the the collection
area.

2401
01:48:12,711 --> 01:48:13,170
It's going to look at different 
wavelengths of light.

2402
01:48:13,171 --> 01:48:18,171
It's going to push what Hubble has been 
able to do to look back to the earliest 

2403
01:48:18,171 --> 01:48:22,191
galaxies that ever formed first light as
we call them and starts first turned on 

2404
01:48:22,191 --> 01:48:22,600
the first stars that formed in the 
universe.

2405
01:48:22,601 --> 01:48:24,930
It's going to be fascinating,
but there's a chicken and egg question.

2406
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:27,870
If most galaxies have supermassive black
holes in them,

2407
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:33,410
which came first and did the black holes
form and that was necessary for the 

2408
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:36,550
galaxies to coalesce around them or did 
the galaxies existed,

2409
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:41,560
and then the black holes built up 
hierarchically by swallowing things and 

2410
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:42,000
getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
It's a question we don't know the answer

2411
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:43,680
to.
When we build that thing,

2412
01:48:43,681 --> 01:48:46,380
we might have the answer to it.
It'll be an interesting question that we

2413
01:48:46,381 --> 01:48:51,381
resolve.
It is amazing that as far as we can 

2414
01:48:51,381 --> 01:48:54,381
tell,
these supermassive black holes exist 

2415
01:48:54,381 --> 01:48:54,381
even though we don't know they're black 
holes.

2416
01:48:54,381 --> 01:48:57,740
By the way.
We know they kind of looked like black 

2417
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:57,840
holes and quack like black holes and 
walk like black hole black holes,

2418
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:03,200
but we.
What I mean is there we can tell their 

2419
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,170
mass contra concentrations that are 
immense.

2420
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:09,500
A billion solar masses in a region so 
small that our theories tell us they 

2421
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,670
should be a black hole,
but we don't know if,

2422
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:12,330
if,
if,

2423
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:16,350
if the consequences of generality tell 
us that they are black holes,

2424
01:49:16,351 --> 01:49:21,351
but we.
The simplest assumption is that they 

2425
01:49:21,351 --> 01:49:21,351
are,
that nothing escapes from them,

2426
01:49:21,351 --> 01:49:25,190
that they,
that they formed classically like black 

2427
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:25,190
holes and they're fascinating and we'll 
learn about.

2428
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:29,870
We're learning about black holes by the 
way or putative black holes in ways we 

2429
01:49:29,870 --> 01:49:31,230
never thought we could because we now 
have a new window in the universe.

2430
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:32,970
Gravitational waves.
These,

2431
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:38,160
this ligo detector just detected graves 
gravitational waves from colliding black

2432
01:49:38,221 --> 01:49:43,221
holes to coalesce and just discovered 
that the predictions of general 

2433
01:49:43,221 --> 01:49:43,230
relativity or validated,
it's a whole.

2434
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:48,290
We're like Galileo,
when he first turned his telescope to 

2435
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:48,580
the heavens and saw the moons of 
Jupiter,

2436
01:49:48,970 --> 01:49:53,970
we've just opened a new window on the 
universe and it will be the new 

2437
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:57,361
astronomy,
the 21st and 22nd centuries and we will 

2438
01:49:57,361 --> 01:50:00,541
learn things we had no knowledge about 
because that new window will reveal to 

2439
01:50:00,541 --> 01:50:03,970
us the dynamics of black holes in ways 
we never thought possible.

2440
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,660
So it's an amazing time to be alive.
And I attended.

2441
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:08,380
Think that's also a time invariant 
statement.

2442
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:09,610
But,
but anyway,

2443
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:11,500
so everything.
So the black.

2444
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:16,590
But what happens inside black holes is a
question that's much different and the 

2445
01:50:16,871 --> 01:50:20,350
answer is we don't know.
We don't know.

2446
01:50:20,351 --> 01:50:25,351
We know classically,
if general relativity tells us what's 

2447
01:50:25,351 --> 01:50:28,051
happening,
we know that this things will collapse 

2448
01:50:28,051 --> 01:50:28,560
to an infinitely dance singularity,
but you know,

2449
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:33,570
most of us physicists think infinite is 
a pretty bad word that in than in 

2450
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:37,350
physical reality,
things don't get into dense that the 

2451
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:39,631
laws of quantum mechanics,
you're going to change things and when 

2452
01:50:39,631 --> 01:50:43,351
things get sufficiently dense so that 
quantum mechanics has to be applied to 

2453
01:50:43,351 --> 01:50:46,681
gravity and the only time that really 
happens operationally or either the 

2454
01:50:47,591 --> 01:50:50,740
beginning of our universe when our 
entire observable universe was in,

2455
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:55,870
in potentially and infinitely dense 
singularity or at the center of black 

2456
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:55,870
holes.

2457
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:56,860
That's the only places where that 
matters.

2458
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,310
When quantum mechanics must be applied 
to gravity.

2459
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:05,700
Our current physical theories breakdown,
so we don't know what happens in the 

2460
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:07,360
ultimate state of black holes.
We don't know.

2461
01:51:07,361 --> 01:51:10,210
One possibility is indeed they do our 
portal to another universe.

2462
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:15,570
Because what's really interesting is 
when what you see from the inside of a 

2463
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:15,910
black hole and the outside are very 
different.

2464
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:20,770
If you're inside of a black hole in 
space could look like it's expanding.

2465
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:26,430
Whereas outside the black hole,
it can look like the black hole is 

2466
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:26,430
contracting.
Why is that?

2467
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,150
Because general activity tells you that 
your,

2468
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:33,960
that your perceptions of what space is 
doing around you in some sense depends 

2469
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:37,260
upon your the gravitational 
configuration in which you live.

2470
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:42,310
You live in general,
you can be moving and standing still at 

2471
01:51:42,371 --> 01:51:44,410
the same time.
We're doing it right now.

2472
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:49,980
I'm not moving much with respect to you.
I had a little bit of coffee so I'm 

2473
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,651
shaking a little bit but but,
but relative to a radio conversations 

2474
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:56,770
that are happening in the studio at the 
other end of the visible universe,

2475
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:01,980
we're moving away at the speed of light 
and those individuals having that 

2476
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:02,680
conversation are also at rest and their 
local surroundings,

2477
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:04,750
but they're moving away from us at the 
speed of light.

2478
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:08,020
How is that possible?
Because locally spaces at rest,

2479
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:13,290
but globally space is expanding.
So generativity says that what you 

2480
01:52:13,571 --> 01:52:18,571
consider to be happening to space around
you depends on your local environment 

2481
01:52:18,581 --> 01:52:21,730
and what you defined so you can locally 
be at rest,

2482
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:24,220
but globally be part of an expanding 
universe.

2483
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:26,500
Similarly,
inside of a black hole,

2484
01:52:26,501 --> 01:52:31,501
the direction of time reverses,
it turns out because space and time are 

2485
01:52:31,501 --> 01:52:32,530
tied together.
So if you see so,

2486
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:36,130
so what you perceive inside of a black 
hole to be happening,

2487
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:37,560
um,
to,

2488
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:42,620
to,
to the time evolution of the system 

2489
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:45,290
you're in would be very different than 
what's seen from outside to be happening

2490
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:46,820
at the surface of the black hole.

2491
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:52,090
I mean,
whack holes are fascinating and there 

2492
01:52:52,090 --> 01:52:53,450
are laboratories of the boat that allow 
us to focus on the physics.

2493
01:52:53,451 --> 01:52:56,570
We can't yet fully understand how long 
have we known about them?

2494
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:02,560
Well,
the idea of a black hole was first 

2495
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:02,560
thought about,
uh,

2496
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:06,640
uh,
people wondered whether what was the 

2497
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,081
ultimate state of gravitational collapse
and people that argued that maybe the 

2498
01:53:08,081 --> 01:53:10,610
ultimate state of gravitation collapse 
was these things called that we now call

2499
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:12,920
black holes.
There was a big debate about it.

2500
01:53:12,921 --> 01:53:15,290
Oppenheimer and Snyder in the 19 forties
and fifties,

2501
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:18,260
the person who first named black holes 
was John Wheeler.

2502
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:24,180
It amuses me.
He came up with the term black hole in 

2503
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:27,041
1965 or something like that to describe 
the ultimate state of collapsing met 

2504
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:32,140
people felt it was impossible.
There'd be that physically forces would 

2505
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:36,281
stop things from collapsing to the kind 
of densities that black holes would 

2506
01:53:36,281 --> 01:53:40,301
format,
but based on the work of Sake Saker and 

2507
01:53:40,301 --> 01:53:42,821
others,
it was discovered that if you have a 

2508
01:53:42,821 --> 01:53:44,771
more massive object that's massive 
enough nuclear forces and all other 

2509
01:53:44,771 --> 01:53:48,851
forces cannot fight against 
gravitational collapse and eventually 

2510
01:53:48,851 --> 01:53:50,180
things will collapse inside of what we 
call the event horizon.

2511
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:53,690
It's the ultimate say clap that it was 
hugely debated in the thirties,

2512
01:53:53,691 --> 01:53:54,650
forties,
fifties.

2513
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:58,160
By the 19 sixties it was accepted and 
interestingly enough,

2514
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:02,840
wheeler was one who first thought it 
couldn't happen later on,

2515
01:54:02,841 --> 01:54:07,841
came up with the name black holes and I 
think that's one of the reasons that 

2516
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:08,630
people are so fascinated by black holes.
Turns out in Russian,

2517
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:13,460
the term for black hole was frozen star 
and you don't see movies made in Russia,

2518
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:18,470
but about frozen stars.
You see a lot of movies about black 

2519
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:18,470
holes is a great name.
Yeah.

2520
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:20,480
And you know why the weights,
why it's a frozen start.

2521
01:54:20,481 --> 01:54:22,620
Let me blow your mind a little bit.
Okay.

2522
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:27,620
When objects are falling into,
so one of the things you need to know is

2523
01:54:27,621 --> 01:54:32,621
the rate at which our talk,
our clocks tick depends on the 

2524
01:54:32,621 --> 01:54:35,690
gravitational field we're in.
So if I'm way above the earth's surface,

2525
01:54:35,691 --> 01:54:38,150
my clock is ticking at a different rate 
than your clock.

2526
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:44,020
This sounds so crazy,
but we needed every day because you 

2527
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:45,170
know,
what did you use gps at all today?

2528
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:47,600
Wouldn't have worked if it wasn't for 
that.

2529
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:52,780
Because the clocks and the set gps 
satellites are ticking at a different 

2530
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:56,321
rate than the clocks on earth because of
general relativity because they're in a 

2531
01:54:56,321 --> 01:54:59,801
different.
They're higher up with respect to the 

2532
01:54:59,801 --> 01:54:59,801
earth.
So they had to calculate.

2533
01:54:59,801 --> 01:55:01,340
We have to know,
use that effect to Qa to correct.

2534
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:06,610
If it wasn't for that case,
your GPS would go out of alignment and 

2535
01:55:06,610 --> 01:55:07,790
less than one minute.
We use it every single day.

2536
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:10,610
So explain that please.
So the GPS,

2537
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:15,760
the GPS,
global positioning satellites that are 

2538
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,461
in orbit,
they take into account the fact that 

2539
01:55:18,461 --> 01:55:21,101
there are higher above the earth,
that their clocks are ticking more 

2540
01:55:21,101 --> 01:55:21,101
slowly than ours.
How do we know that?

2541
01:55:21,101 --> 01:55:25,220
Because how do they know where we are by
by a triangulation,

2542
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:25,580
they.

2543
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:27,710
They basically look at the time it 
takes.

2544
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:33,130
They have atomic clocks,
clocks the time it takes for a signal 

2545
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:36,290
from your watch or your phone to get up 
to the satellite and back and that other

2546
01:55:36,291 --> 01:55:39,730
satellite and back allows you to 
determine your position [inaudible].

2547
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:45,270
But if the clock is ticking at a rate 
than you get a wrong answer for the time

2548
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:48,840
it takes for it to go on the the,
the number you get from that satellite.

2549
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:51,690
When it reports to your watch,
is it slower,

2550
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:52,980
faster?
Well,

2551
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:58,130
due to there are two effects due to its 
motion due to its motion.

2552
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:00,460
It's,
well,

2553
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:02,490
how can I say this?
It's basically slower,

2554
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:05,370
but due to its motion,
it's taking it a slower rate.

2555
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:10,970
Okay.
Due to its height in the gravitational 

2556
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:11,490
field,
it turns out that it's faster.

2557
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:16,520
So the two effects counter each other.
General relativity in class and 

2558
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:17,070
specialty J in this case,
general relativity winds,

2559
01:56:17,071 --> 01:56:18,990
I think it's something like,
uh,

2560
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:21,190
they're,
they're ticking more slowly at.

2561
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:26,250
I calculated once I wrote a New York 
Times piece on this and I forget the 

2562
01:56:26,250 --> 01:56:27,300
number,
but it's something like,

2563
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:33,540
of the order of 38 microseconds per day,
they're clicking,

2564
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:35,510
they're taking at a slower rate,
million,

2565
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:39,960
38 millions of a second every,
every day different.

2566
01:56:39,961 --> 01:56:44,961
And that may not sound important to you,
but if you calculate how far light 

2567
01:56:44,961 --> 01:56:46,950
travels in 38 millions of a second,
it's pretty far.

2568
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:49,150
And so therefore,
if you,

2569
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:54,280
if you,
if you keep getting wrong by that 

2570
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:54,280
number,
your,

2571
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:56,100
your determination of your position is 
going to keep getting wrong by that,

2572
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:57,660
by that number.
And,

2573
01:56:57,661 --> 01:57:02,661
and I worked out I,
and then this should allow me to work 

2574
01:57:02,661 --> 01:57:02,661
backwards.
If I had a pad and paper,

2575
01:57:02,661 --> 01:57:02,910
um,
I see a pad,

2576
01:57:02,911 --> 01:57:04,470
but I know I'm not going to do it right 
now because I'm okay,

2577
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:09,710
but I remembered you'd be out by 
something like a kilometer in two 

2578
01:57:09,710 --> 01:57:09,710
minutes.

2579
01:57:09,710 --> 01:57:10,500
Wow.
Isn't that amazing?

2580
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:15,560
That is amazing.
So we use these abstract esoteric 

2581
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:17,430
principles and they govern our lives.
So general activity really isn't matters

2582
01:57:17,431 --> 01:57:19,410
for our technology,
but it tells us.

2583
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:22,710
But what's really interesting,
so as objects fall into a black hole,

2584
01:57:22,711 --> 01:57:27,711
because they're getting stronger and 
stronger gravitational fields from the 

2585
01:57:27,711 --> 01:57:30,951
outside,
we see them moving more and more slowly 

2586
01:57:30,951 --> 01:57:34,880
and eventually we seed them freeze at 
the surface we will never see from the 

2587
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:39,351
outside.
It will look like it will take an 

2588
01:57:39,351 --> 01:57:41,481
infinite amount of time for an object to
fall through the event horizon of a 

2589
01:57:41,481 --> 01:57:44,961
black hole.
Even though in its own frame it falls 

2590
01:57:44,961 --> 01:57:45,330
through no problem for us.
It will watch it slowly,

2591
01:57:45,331 --> 01:57:50,331
slowly,
slowly because it's clock is literally 

2592
01:57:50,331 --> 01:57:51,150
ticking at a different rate and it will 
take an infinite amount of time for us,

2593
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:54,240
for any object to fall through the event
horizon black hole.

2594
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:57,660
If we're watching from the outside,
that's why the Russians call them frozen

2595
01:57:57,661 --> 01:57:59,310
stars.
Isn't that weird?

2596
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:00,660
It's crazy.
It is,

2597
01:58:00,661 --> 01:58:01,800
but it's true.
Now,

2598
01:58:01,801 --> 01:58:06,801
where did the concept come from that 
inside every black hole is perhaps 

2599
01:58:06,801 --> 01:58:07,380
hundreds of billions of galaxies each 
with a black hole in front of it.

2600
01:58:07,530 --> 01:58:08,210
Oh,
well I don't.

2601
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:11,880
I never heard that concept.
What I have heard is that is that at the

2602
01:58:11,881 --> 01:58:13,110
singularity,
the singularity,

2603
01:58:13,111 --> 01:58:14,740
maybe a portal to another universe,
right?

2604
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:20,030
And moreover that,
that that inside the black hole you 

2605
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:20,730
could,
you could imagine that,

2606
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:25,750
that you're observing a space that 
appears to be expanding instead of 

2607
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:29,121
contracting.
And is it possible that those inside 

2608
01:58:29,121 --> 01:58:32,301
that black hole,
that universe would not have the same 

2609
01:58:32,301 --> 01:58:32,301
laws of physics that we.
Well,

2610
01:58:32,301 --> 01:58:36,681
once it goes through the singularity,
who knows because the laws of physics 

2611
01:58:36,681 --> 01:58:36,681
breakdown,
but one thing I can tell you for sure is

2612
01:58:36,681 --> 01:58:39,060
there aren't millions of billions of 
galaxies inside that black hole.

2613
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:44,390
And you know why?
Because gravity allows us to measure 

2614
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:47,030
what the total mass of the black hole is
for in that sense of black holes it.

2615
01:58:47,410 --> 01:58:52,410
Well,
if it's a portal that's a different 

2616
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:52,410
universe,
right,

2617
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:54,900
that's what I'm saying.
But after that's when then it's no 

2618
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:57,391
longer inside the black hole,
but it's wonderful that the black holes 

2619
01:58:57,461 --> 01:58:59,350
are just like any other stars,
you know,

2620
01:58:59,351 --> 01:59:00,460
you can rub it around them,
you know?

2621
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:05,520
Not everything falls into a black hole 
because if you're far enough away you 

2622
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,550
can just do an orbit like a planet 
around the sun.

2623
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:11,730
The Sun is attracting us,
but the earth doesn't fall into it and 

2624
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:14,700
not in a normal amount of time.
Do you anticipate that that's something 

2625
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:18,151
that we might try to do in the future?
Send a satellite into the black hole 

2626
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:21,480
first we'd have to find a black hole or 
the one in the center of our galaxy 

2627
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:21,480
perhaps.
Well,

2628
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:23,560
that you know how long it takes to get 
to this end of the golf is 40.

2629
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:25,660
The center of our galaxy is 40,000
light years away,

2630
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:28,030
so it's a long experiment.

2631
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:32,530
Yeah,
it's unfortunate.

2632
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:35,860
It's not clear to me the national 
science foundation under trump or anyone

2633
01:59:35,861 --> 01:59:37,840
else is going gonna Fund that fund that.
Yeah.

2634
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:40,330
Now what about having a week?
I'd be interested if we could send a lot

2635
01:59:40,331 --> 01:59:45,331
of congress to explore what the what 
it's like at the center of the black 

2636
01:59:45,331 --> 01:59:45,640
hole.
That would be a solution.

2637
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,650
Maybe suit them all up.
Yeah.

2638
01:59:47,651 --> 01:59:52,651
Sued 'em all up.
Go boldly go where no man or woman has 

2639
01:59:52,651 --> 01:59:55,531
gone before.
What about black holes that are not 

2640
01:59:55,531 --> 01:59:56,170
attached to galaxies?
While we don't see them,

2641
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:58,750
we don't.
I mean right now we have.

2642
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:01,500
I don't believe anyone's because here's 
how you.

2643
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:06,540
How do you see a black hole?
You have to see the star circling 

2644
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:06,540
around.
Exactly right.

2645
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:08,560
It's the only way you can see that.
So those just theoretical.

2646
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:11,330
The stars that aren't the black holes 
rather that aren't attached to.

2647
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:14,200
Well,
I mean and not only are the theoretical,

2648
02:00:14,201 --> 02:00:19,201
I think very few people argue there are 
many such things because we tend to 

2649
02:00:19,201 --> 02:00:23,641
think that stars conglomerated around 
around regions where there's dominant 

2650
02:00:23,641 --> 02:00:23,860
mass,
right?

2651
02:00:23,861 --> 02:00:28,861
They collapsed and so while it's true 
that the galaxies are just the tip of a 

2652
02:00:28,861 --> 02:00:32,470
dominant of a cosmic iceberg,
most of the massive galaxies isn't stars

2653
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:35,050
or black holes.
It's this stuff called dark matter.

2654
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:38,630
What is that stuff you can see and try 
to explain it to me and told him,

2655
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:39,670
get in there either.
Well,

2656
02:00:39,671 --> 02:00:44,671
it's look,
it's really quite simple when we way 

2657
02:00:44,671 --> 02:00:47,441
galaxies,
which we can do by seeing how fast the 

2658
02:00:47,441 --> 02:00:50,141
stars move around them,
we find out that they weigh a lot more 

2659
02:00:50,141 --> 02:00:53,371
than could be accounted by counting all 
the stars so the dominant mass doesn't 

2660
02:00:53,371 --> 02:00:54,760
shine.
We call that dark matter,

2661
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:58,450
not too surprising and what,
but what we have discovered,

2662
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:04,050
and this is the surprising part,
is we can estimate how much normal 

2663
02:01:04,050 --> 02:01:07,681
matter there is and by normal matter I 
mean the stuff made of protons and 

2664
02:01:07,681 --> 02:01:10,441
neutrons the same as you and me and when
we add up how much dark matter we see in

2665
02:01:10,541 --> 02:01:10,960
the universe.

2666
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:16,230
There's a heck of a lot more of that 
than can be accounted for by the total 

2667
02:01:16,230 --> 02:01:16,660
number of protons and neutrons in the 
universe.

2668
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:22,380
And that means that we think the dark 
matter is made of some new type of 

2669
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:25,171
elementary particle.
Something that was created in the early 

2670
02:01:25,171 --> 02:01:25,600
history of the universe that's different
than normal matter.

2671
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:31,560
That's not too surprising either because
in the early universe there was lots of 

2672
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:31,840
energy around and if they're new 
elementary particles that are stable,

2673
02:01:31,841 --> 02:01:36,841
it's not too surprising that there are 
lots of them around and if they don't 

2674
02:01:36,841 --> 02:01:36,841
interact with light,
we wouldn't see them.

2675
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:40,190
In fact,
not only is that reasonable,

2676
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:43,280
but we cannot understand how galaxies 
would form.

2677
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:47,780
If it weren't for dark matter.
We can do the calculations and show that

2678
02:01:47,781 --> 02:01:48,470
if it,
if the,

2679
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:53,650
if there is a dark matter weren't made 
of stuff that's different than protons 

2680
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:55,250
and neutrons,
there would not have been enough time in

2681
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:57,950
the history of the universe for galaxies
to form.

2682
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:04,180
Therefore,
that's really strong evidence that that 

2683
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:07,211
stuff must be there and it must not be 
made of protons and neutrons because 

2684
02:02:07,211 --> 02:02:07,970
we're proof.
You and I that galaxies formed.

2685
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:14,020
It's so fascinating that there's this 
element that's a huge part of the 

2686
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:15,200
universe itself.
The word,

2687
02:02:15,201 --> 02:02:17,450
not really exactly sure what it is.
Yeah.

2688
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:18,860
Isn't that great?
It's amazing.

2689
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:20,300
It's amazing.
There are mysteries.

2690
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:23,720
What unfortunately people get told is 
that it makes it seem like,

2691
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:26,270
you know,
science was done and it's all done.

2692
02:02:26,271 --> 02:02:28,070
It was done by dead white men 200 years 
ago.

2693
02:02:28,071 --> 02:02:33,071
That's not the mysteries continue.
That's why it's the greatest story ever 

2694
02:02:33,071 --> 02:02:36,941
told so far.
That's why young kids should be 

2695
02:02:36,941 --> 02:02:39,011
interested in science because life is 
full of mysteries and we've learned so 

2696
02:02:39,011 --> 02:02:42,821
much about the universe,
but it gets more mysterious and more 

2697
02:02:42,821 --> 02:02:44,780
exciting and every time we open a new 
window on the universe were surprised.

2698
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:48,500
That's why we got to keep looking out 
and not looking in.

2699
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:52,700
Tell me about hyper Novas.
Hyper Novas.

2700
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:56,840
I watched a science documentary freaked 
me out about how when they first started

2701
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:59,420
measuring gamma ray bursts out into the 
unit.

2702
02:02:59,421 --> 02:03:02,150
They thought there was wars going on 
between alien races.

2703
02:03:02,210 --> 02:03:07,210
Well,
the point is that you know how you know 

2704
02:03:07,210 --> 02:03:07,280
there are these things called gamma ray 
bursts and what they are.

2705
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:10,940
Gamma rays are extremely energetic forms
of light if you want to think about it,

2706
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:14,810
and they're among other things that are 
admitted in nuclear weapons explosions.

2707
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:16,450
Okay.
And,

2708
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:18,500
and you know how they were discovered.
It's really neat.

2709
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:22,040
It's one of the few examples of defense 
money,

2710
02:03:22,041 --> 02:03:25,190
well spent in my opinion,
but maybe not the few,

2711
02:03:25,191 --> 02:03:27,000
but I now that you'll get lots of eight 
mil.

2712
02:03:27,001 --> 02:03:27,770
So we'll like that.
Anyway.

2713
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:30,920
Um,
so there were these satellites that were

2714
02:03:30,921 --> 02:03:35,060
designed to go up that were earth 
monitoring to look for gamma rays.

2715
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:40,060
Why?
Cause we were looking for nuclear 

2716
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:40,880
weapons explosions to see if the Soviets
or some other country where we're having

2717
02:03:40,881 --> 02:03:43,040
nuclear weapons closer.
There's one way to monitor what year was

2718
02:03:43,041 --> 02:03:43,730
this one?
Oh,

2719
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:48,740
this was.
These satellites were put up in the 

2720
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:49,130
sixties and seventies.
So this is around the time they did that

2721
02:03:49,131 --> 02:03:51,660
operation starfish prime,
where they detonated in new,

2722
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:53,300
into the,
into the,

2723
02:03:53,301 --> 02:03:54,710
uh,
atmosphere.

2724
02:03:54,711 --> 02:03:56,690
The magnetosphere probably,
I don't know,

2725
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:58,640
but I honestly don't know the answer to 
that question,

2726
02:03:58,641 --> 02:04:03,641
but,
but the point is they were used by the 

2727
02:04:03,641 --> 02:04:04,340
as monitoring systems to look for 
nuclear weapons explosions.

2728
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:07,940
And then these things are sure,
looking downward discover these,

2729
02:04:07,941 --> 02:04:12,941
get these short bursts of gamma rays,
which would be a potential signature of 

2730
02:04:12,941 --> 02:04:17,291
nuclear weapons explosions.
But they discovered they weren't coming 

2731
02:04:17,291 --> 02:04:19,991
from earth and then they discovered they
were coming from everywhere in the 

2732
02:04:19,991 --> 02:04:21,200
cosmos,
and that's how they were discovered.

2733
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:23,030
These devices,
we're monitoring the earth,

2734
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:26,450
looking for nuclear weapons explosions,
and then saw them out in space.

2735
02:04:26,451 --> 02:04:29,090
How many of them were well?
They're everywhere.

2736
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:31,340
There's millions of them and they happen
there.

2737
02:04:31,341 --> 02:04:32,570
One second,
two second,

2738
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:35,330
one minute long bursts that are 
incredibly energetic.

2739
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:38,520
It meaning more energy than Sun may meet
in this lifetime,

2740
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:41,670
in its lifetime,
and they're happening all the time.

2741
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:43,050
They're happening all the time.
You know why?

2742
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,790
Because the great thing about the 
universities,

2743
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:49,500
it's big and it's old and therefore a 
rare events happen all the time.

2744
02:04:49,501 --> 02:04:53,570
Let me give you an example.
Stars explode and it's good for us.

2745
02:04:53,571 --> 02:04:56,890
It starts exploding about in this book 
because it it's it.

2746
02:04:57,100 --> 02:05:02,100
Because every atom in your body and 
every atom in my body was made inside 

2747
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:02,450
stars that eventually explode.
Well,

2748
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:05,070
how do we know that?
Because in the big bang,

2749
02:05:05,071 --> 02:05:06,990
the only elements that were created were
hydrogen,

2750
02:05:07,230 --> 02:05:08,670
helium,
and a little bit of lithium.

2751
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:10,990
Okay?
But the importance for some people,

2752
02:05:10,991 --> 02:05:12,230
that seems important,
but the rest of us,

2753
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:14,040
rest of us,
carbon,

2754
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:15,420
nitrogen,
oxygen,

2755
02:05:15,421 --> 02:05:20,421
iron,
all the stuff that makes us human was 

2756
02:05:20,421 --> 02:05:21,510
only created in the fiery furnaces,
in the cores of stars.

2757
02:05:22,110 --> 02:05:23,730
And how could it get into your and my 
body?

2758
02:05:23,950 --> 02:05:26,010
Because there were stars that were kind 
enough to explode.

2759
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:28,590
So as I once said,
and some people put on t shirts now,

2760
02:05:28,710 --> 02:05:30,510
so forget Jesus.
The stars died.

2761
02:05:30,511 --> 02:05:31,630
So we could be born.
Okay,

2762
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:33,480
but,
but here's the deal.

2763
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:37,470
Stars explode about once every hundred 
years per galaxy.

2764
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:43,040
So in our galaxy,
once every hundred years to stars 

2765
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,591
explodes,
there have been about 200 million stars 

2766
02:05:45,591 --> 02:05:48,141
explode in the 14 billion years or 12 
billion years since our galaxy has been 

2767
02:05:48,141 --> 02:05:49,350
around.
And that's produced the raw materials at

2768
02:05:49,351 --> 02:05:54,351
four and a half billion years ago,
coalesce to form our sun and the 

2769
02:05:54,351 --> 02:05:54,351
planets.

2770
02:05:54,351 --> 02:05:55,780
And you and I.
So all the atoms in your body Balms,

2771
02:05:55,820 --> 02:06:00,820
restores and been through the most 
intense explosion that we know of in 

2772
02:06:00,820 --> 02:06:04,251
nature.
A supernova and every atom in your body 

2773
02:06:04,251 --> 02:06:05,640
is experiencing maybe more than once.
Because to get to the amount of carbon,

2774
02:06:05,641 --> 02:06:06,500
nitrogen,
oxygen,

2775
02:06:06,501 --> 02:06:09,360
and that's in our bodies,
it had to be recycled many times.

2776
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:14,510
So the Adams in your left hand may have 
been inside a different star than your 

2777
02:06:14,510 --> 02:06:14,510
right hand.
You're really star dust.

2778
02:06:14,510 --> 02:06:18,901
We're all stardust where we're really 
connected the cosmos in really 

2779
02:06:18,901 --> 02:06:21,750
interesting and important ways.
We literally were created by stars.

2780
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:22,920
That's great thing,
but,

2781
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:27,940
but,
but that's not the point I wanted to 

2782
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:29,451
make.
The point I wanted to make was stars 

2783
02:06:29,451 --> 02:06:30,330
explode once for a hundred years per 
galaxy.

2784
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:33,690
We use supernovae as a way to probe the 
universe.

2785
02:06:34,110 --> 02:06:39,110
How can we do that if one,
if we're looking at galaxies and one 

2786
02:06:39,110 --> 02:06:39,870
star explodes every hundred years and 
the galaxy,

2787
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:41,270
how can we use them as probes?

2788
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:41,970
Well,
as I say,

2789
02:06:41,971 --> 02:06:44,880
there's one way is to sign a graduate 
student teach galaxy.

2790
02:06:45,390 --> 02:06:50,390
You know,
the phd period can be about a hundred 

2791
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:50,390
years and if they die,
students are cheap.

2792
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:54,531
So you get a new one or we use a nomad.
This fact that the universe is big and 

2793
02:06:54,531 --> 02:06:58,881
old.
If you take your hands up tonight and 

2794
02:06:58,881 --> 02:07:01,330
and we're in Los Angeles where you could
see the stars and it held a dime sized,

2795
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:05,460
made a dime sized hole,
and looked up at a dime size dark region

2796
02:07:05,461 --> 02:07:06,750
of the universe.
You know what?

2797
02:07:06,751 --> 02:07:11,751
You didn't see any stars.
If you had a telescope that as big as 

2798
02:07:11,751 --> 02:07:13,080
the telescope in Chile,
you'd see 100,000

2799
02:07:13,081 --> 02:07:15,510
galaxies,
100,000

2800
02:07:15,511 --> 02:07:20,511
galaxies and that small region.
Then if one star explodes every hundred 

2801
02:07:20,511 --> 02:07:21,520
years per galaxy,
if you work out,

2802
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:23,580
how many stars will I see?
Explode tonight?

2803
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:29,150
You'll find out.
You'll see two or three stars explode 

2804
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:29,150
just in that dime.

2805
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:29,150
Size.
Yeah,

2806
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:33,170
because the universe is big and old and 
rare events happen all the time and 

2807
02:07:33,170 --> 02:07:38,151
that's what makes the universe so 
exciting because now we can use 

2808
02:07:38,151 --> 02:07:39,310
supernova to study the universe because 
astronomers write proposals and say,

2809
02:07:39,311 --> 02:07:41,920
tonight,
I mean use the Hubble space telescope to

2810
02:07:41,921 --> 02:07:44,110
look at this region and I'm going to see
three stars explode.

2811
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:45,880
Wow.
Isn't that amazing?

2812
02:07:46,150 --> 02:07:47,310
That is amazing.
Yeah.

2813
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:52,410
It's just the.
And isn't it a shame that more people 

2814
02:07:52,410 --> 02:07:53,170
don't realize that?
Because that's as amazing as you know,

2815
02:07:53,171 --> 02:07:54,340
as anything.
I mean,

2816
02:07:54,341 --> 02:07:55,840
that's the kind of thing that makes 
like,

2817
02:07:55,841 --> 02:07:57,930
oh wow,
that's,

2818
02:07:58,270 --> 02:07:59,350
that's neat.
And it's,

2819
02:07:59,351 --> 02:08:01,930
as I say,
it's neat to see a great movie too,

2820
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:07,350
but that they're all together.
Science is fun and Neat and interesting 

2821
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:07,840
and you don't have to be a scientist to 
find it.

2822
02:08:07,841 --> 02:08:09,430
Amazing.
Yeah.

2823
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:11,350
That is about as amazing as it gets.

2824
02:08:11,530 --> 02:08:13,450
I think we don't.
We have a real issue.

2825
02:08:13,451 --> 02:08:17,670
I think with cities were light pollution
prevents people from seeing your amazing

2826
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:18,360
stars.
In fact,

2827
02:08:18,370 --> 02:08:20,290
there's a lot of astronomers who are,
who are doing,

2828
02:08:20,291 --> 02:08:25,291
in fact I'm active work to try and 
reduce light pollution in cities near 

2829
02:08:25,481 --> 02:08:27,160
telescopes.
And there's other.

2830
02:08:27,190 --> 02:08:28,190
I mean,
the accuracy,

2831
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:33,200
but radio telescope is an amazing.
If you've never been down to Puerto 

2832
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:33,200
Rico,
it's beautiful.

2833
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:37,321
It was actually,
you would have seen it in to James Bond 

2834
02:08:37,321 --> 02:08:37,321
movies because they made it into like 
the layer of,

2835
02:08:37,321 --> 02:08:37,321
uh,
you know,

2836
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,150
the pictures of it in the layer of,
of,

2837
02:08:39,151 --> 02:08:43,510
of some crazy evil scientists.
And I've been there a few times and it's

2838
02:08:43,511 --> 02:08:46,840
amazing because it's this thousand meter
wide net of,

2839
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:47,860
of,
of,

2840
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:52,920
of wires in a,
in a natural sort of volcanic volcanic 

2841
02:08:52,961 --> 02:08:54,280
cap account.
It's really beautiful.

2842
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:56,230
And there's jungle growing underneath 
it.

2843
02:08:56,350 --> 02:09:01,350
I'd walked underneath it.
And the receivables Pedro scope is 

2844
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:01,350
amazing because it,
it,

2845
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:05,620
it because it's so big,
it allows us to measure lots of neat 

2846
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:05,620
things in the universe.
In fact,

2847
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:08,200
you could measure a light bulb on Pluto 
if there was a light bulb.

2848
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:09,880
You know,
we're looking at the picture of it now.

2849
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:11,830
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

2850
02:09:11,831 --> 02:09:14,650
And you can't even get the sense of the 
size of it necessarily from that.

2851
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:16,450
It's all wired.
So it's all wires.

2852
02:09:16,451 --> 02:09:21,451
It's not solid.
It's wires because it's only measuring 

2853
02:09:21,451 --> 02:09:23,551
radio waves if the wavelength is large 
compared to the spacing between the 

2854
02:09:23,551 --> 02:09:23,920
wires,
you don't need something solid.

2855
02:09:23,980 --> 02:09:24,670
Right?
Okay.

2856
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:26,820
So,
uh,

2857
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:32,520
they were worried.
And this is a real example they're 

2858
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:32,520
looking for,
among other things,

2859
02:09:32,650 --> 02:09:37,650
a frequency of radiation which is 
ubiquitous in the universe that is 

2860
02:09:37,650 --> 02:09:41,251
emitted by hydrogen.
It was the first sort of thing that 

2861
02:09:41,251 --> 02:09:41,251
people used to do,
radio,

2862
02:09:41,251 --> 02:09:45,840
radio astronomy,
hydrogen Mitsa a has a characteristic 

2863
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:49,441
frequency of emission of radio waves due
to due to what's called the high 

2864
02:09:49,441 --> 02:09:49,630
performance building and hydrogen and 
it,

2865
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:49,930
it.

2866
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:51,700
And so people have said,
you know what,

2867
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:57,060
that would be a wonderful frequency for,
for aliens to commute if they really 

2868
02:09:57,060 --> 02:10:00,310
wanted to show it,
if they're smart enough to know that how

2869
02:10:00,311 --> 02:10:02,410
the universe works.
That's a universal frequency.

2870
02:10:02,411 --> 02:10:05,950
That's everywhere because hydrogen is 
the dominant kind of matter and it all,

2871
02:10:06,010 --> 02:10:08,170
it always emits radiation at that 
frequency.

2872
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:13,280
Okay.
A thousand 40 megahertz I think is the 

2873
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:13,280
frequency.
Okay.

2874
02:10:13,550 --> 02:10:15,140
A yellow,
again,

2875
02:10:15,141 --> 02:10:16,810
it could be wrong,
but something like that.

2876
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:22,110
And uh,
but they're worried because there was 

2877
02:10:22,110 --> 02:10:25,320
nearby are stable.
There was an evangelist who had a huge 

2878
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:29,671
radio station and wanted to broadcast to
the continental United States is 

2879
02:10:29,671 --> 02:10:34,200
evangelical message and he was going to 
basically at a frequency that would mean

2880
02:10:35,031 --> 02:10:38,270
that she couldn't work anymore.
Speaking of light pollution,

2881
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:40,280
we talked about light pollution.
That was radio pollution.

2882
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:45,760
And in this case,
it was pollution in many ways because 

2883
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:45,760
everything you said was polluting,
but,

2884
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:45,760
but,
uh,

2885
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:45,760
and,
and,

2886
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:47,480
and finally they managed to be able to 
fix that,

2887
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:52,481
but there would have been one of the 
most amazing windows on the universe 

2888
02:10:52,481 --> 02:10:54,650
that would have been blocked out by 
radio light,

2889
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:55,940
just like from an evangelists.

2890
02:10:55,950 --> 02:10:56,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

2891
02:10:56,530 --> 02:10:57,890
That's it,
isn't it,

2892
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:59,120
isn't it?
It's very ironic.

2893
02:10:59,150 --> 02:11:04,150
It's,
I think it's very symbolic of many 

2894
02:11:04,150 --> 02:11:04,150
things.
Wow.

2895
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:07,400
That is fascinating moment of silence 
because it's so amazing.

2896
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:07,850
Yeah.
Well,

2897
02:11:07,851 --> 02:11:09,440
it's confusing.
Well,

2898
02:11:09,441 --> 02:11:10,130
yeah.
But that's okay.

2899
02:11:10,131 --> 02:11:12,950
Being confused is that I told you being 
longer.

2900
02:11:12,951 --> 02:11:14,800
Confused is the best part.
No,

2901
02:11:14,830 --> 02:11:18,230
that I and I can get it.
I get it now.

2902
02:11:18,231 --> 02:11:18,870
Um,
when,

2903
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:23,880
when you talk about the vastness of 
space and you talk about space being 14 

2904
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:29,390
billion or whatever it is,
point 8 billion years old plus or minus 

2905
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:32,561
a little bit.
What's the going theory about what was 

2906
02:11:32,561 --> 02:11:35,090
going on before that?
When I wrote a book about it,

2907
02:11:35,091 --> 02:11:36,080
first of all,
but,

2908
02:11:36,110 --> 02:11:36,710
but,
uh,

2909
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:39,160
called the universe from nothing.
The point is we don't.

2910
02:11:39,190 --> 02:11:44,190
The simple answer is we don't know 
because the at the incident of the Big 

2911
02:11:44,190 --> 02:11:48,461
Bang,
the whole universe was contained in a 

2912
02:11:48,461 --> 02:11:50,741
region.
We'd have to understand gravity is a 

2913
02:11:50,741 --> 02:11:54,071
quantum mechanical forest to really 
understand what was happening and we 

2914
02:11:54,071 --> 02:11:54,920
don't have a quantum theory of gravity,
so it's okay to say we don't know,

2915
02:11:55,040 --> 02:12:00,040
but we can say what plausibly was the 
case and one possibility and the 

2916
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:04,331
possibility that looks most plausible 
that I talked about is our universe 

2917
02:12:04,331 --> 02:12:07,310
spontaneously came into being from 
nothing by quantum fluctuations,

2918
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:09,380
a space and time that did not exist.

2919
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:14,560
So our space and our time didn't exist 
and there was no matter in the universe 

2920
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:17,300
and it's suddenly popped into existence 
and one of the neat things is if you add

2921
02:12:17,301 --> 02:12:19,490
up the total energy of all the stuff on 
our universe,

2922
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:22,400
it adds up to zero as far as we can tell
what?

2923
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:23,720
Zero.
What does that,

2924
02:12:23,790 --> 02:12:24,850
how's that?
Because it.

2925
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:29,900
Because gravity allows things to have 
positive energy as well as negative 

2926
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:30,080
energy.
You add it all up and our universe looks

2927
02:12:30,081 --> 02:12:32,600
like in its total energy zero,
but I know you're shaking your head,

2928
02:12:32,601 --> 02:12:34,100
but that's the neat thing is I'm trying 
to.

2929
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:37,100
If you were going to create a universe 
from nothing,

2930
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:38,860
what would you make?
The total energy,

2931
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:41,600
the total energy thing.
Why would you?

2932
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:44,390
Once you realize the total energy 
universe can be zero,

2933
02:12:44,780 --> 02:12:49,780
then the possibility that it comes from 
nothing becomes plausible because if it 

2934
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:50,840
doesn't,
you may need to dd to create everything,

2935
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:56,260
but it turns out you can create a 100 
billion galaxies each containing 100 

2936
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:58,370
billion stars without violating energy 
conservation,

2937
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:00,610
and that isn't it.

2938
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:02,720
It's the ultimate free lunches Alan guth
would say,

2939
02:13:02,910 --> 02:13:05,720
and it's amazing that that's possible.
Now,

2940
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:07,490
can we prove that that happened?
No,

2941
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:10,310
but everything we can point to makes it 
plausible.

2942
02:13:10,311 --> 02:13:11,870
In fact,
you can ask the following question.

2943
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:17,440
What would the universe look like today 
that was created that that that arose 

2944
02:13:18,411 --> 02:13:23,411
spontaneously from nothing,
13 point 8 billion years ago just by 

2945
02:13:24,381 --> 02:13:27,440
known laws of physics or at least 
plausible laws of physics.

2946
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:29,900
What would it look like today,
if that,

2947
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:34,960
if that was the requirement and the 
answer is it will look just like the 

2948
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:37,821
universe in which we live in that.
Does that prove that that's what 

2949
02:13:37,821 --> 02:13:37,821
happened?
No,

2950
02:13:37,821 --> 02:13:41,661
but it makes it plausible and it makes 
it plausible without supernatural 

2951
02:13:41,661 --> 02:13:42,630
shenanigans and anytime you can get rid 
of God,

2952
02:13:42,631 --> 02:13:44,880
it's a good thing,
but isn't something out of nothing.

2953
02:13:44,881 --> 02:13:47,820
Supernatural Shenanigans because it 
happens all the time.

2954
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:48,740
Right?
You know,

2955
02:13:48,741 --> 02:13:49,080
I,
I,

2956
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:51,720
this is an example I've been talking 
about to a few times today to people.

2957
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:55,740
The lights in the studio,
the lights above us,

2958
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,600
our head.
So what happened?

2959
02:13:57,900 --> 02:14:02,280
So electrons change energy levels and 
Adams and they emit photons were,

2960
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:03,810
were the photons before they were 
admitted,

2961
02:14:04,830 --> 02:14:06,670
they weren't in the Adam.
Where were they?

2962
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:08,010
They didn't.
They didn't exist.

2963
02:14:08,011 --> 02:14:13,011
They were spontaneously graded.
They were turned on by the lights 

2964
02:14:13,011 --> 02:14:13,011
switch.
No,

2965
02:14:13,011 --> 02:14:13,011
God,
no.

2966
02:14:13,011 --> 02:14:15,390
They're spontaneously created because 
there's no cause for any of them to.

2967
02:14:15,810 --> 02:14:20,810
Each.
Adam spontaneously decays into a 

2968
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:23,181
different level because quantum 
mechanics says that these things can 

2969
02:14:23,181 --> 02:14:23,181
happen spontaneously.
And when it does,

2970
02:14:23,181 --> 02:14:25,830
a photon is created from nothing.
So here's what I was getting at.

2971
02:14:26,030 --> 02:14:31,030
Yeah.
What is the difference between this 

2972
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:33,351
infinitely dent,
small point that the universe came out 

2973
02:14:33,351 --> 02:14:33,780
of and the center of a black hole.

2974
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:36,660
The event horizon of a black hole?
Well,

2975
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:40,320
another event horizon isn't the center.
It's the outside of the black hole.

2976
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:40,980
The will.
The,

2977
02:14:40,981 --> 02:14:43,350
the answer is there is no different.
No different.

2978
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:48,380
No,
they're singularities where the laws of 

2979
02:14:48,380 --> 02:14:48,380
physics as we know them,
break down.

2980
02:14:48,380 --> 02:14:49,980
Is it possible that inside of each one 
of those black holes is the birth of the

2981
02:14:49,981 --> 02:14:52,140
universe maybe?
Is that how we were?

2982
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:53,400
No,
no,

2983
02:14:53,510 --> 02:14:54,840
I think it's,
I think it's more likely to.

2984
02:14:54,841 --> 02:14:58,050
Quantum mechanics just burped us out per
cosmic burp.

2985
02:14:58,650 --> 02:14:59,340
Much like,
you know,

2986
02:14:59,341 --> 02:15:01,710
I mean I think it's great.
I don't know if you saw in my,

2987
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,900
in my jacket,
which I don't know where I put it,

2988
02:15:03,901 --> 02:15:06,440
but it was probably outside.
Uh,

2989
02:15:06,441 --> 02:15:11,100
I had the flying spaghetti monster 
because I love this because he boiled so

2990
02:15:11,101 --> 02:15:12,880
that we could be alive today.
But it's,

2991
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:14,480
it's,
it's,

2992
02:15:14,750 --> 02:15:15,590
it's,
you know,

2993
02:15:15,610 --> 02:15:18,610
it's just pissing people off me.

2994
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:27,360
But.
So this infinitely dense point of 13 

2995
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:28,890
point 8 billion years ago,
this was whatever it was,

2996
02:15:28,891 --> 02:15:33,891
is this something out of nothing point.
What are your thoughts about before 

2997
02:15:33,891 --> 02:15:33,891
that?
Well,

2998
02:15:33,891 --> 02:15:37,410
here's the thing that you're going to 
hate one possibility,

2999
02:15:37,411 --> 02:15:42,411
which is quite possible and plausible.
If our space suddenly popped out or 

3000
02:15:42,411 --> 02:15:47,271
nothing.
Einstein tells us that space and time 

3001
02:15:47,271 --> 02:15:47,870
are together.
We live in a four dimension universe.

3002
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:50,580
So space began at that instance sort of 
time.

3003
02:15:51,330 --> 02:15:54,210
So there was no before the question 
isn't a good question.

3004
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:56,760
Tom didn't exist to the universe came 
into existence.

3005
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,150
So to ask the question,
what was before is not a good question.

3006
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:03,270
So time didn't exist before 13 point 8 
billion years.

3007
02:16:03,271 --> 02:16:06,600
It could be that if our university is 
all there is and that we happen to think

3008
02:16:06,601 --> 02:16:11,601
by the way is not likely.
But if it is then it doesn't make sense 

3009
02:16:11,601 --> 02:16:13,920
to ask the question what was before 
because Tom didn't exist.

3010
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:16,440
It sounds like a cop out and it Kinda 
is,

3011
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:18,590
but it may also be true.
So.

3012
02:16:19,190 --> 02:16:24,190
And if there's no before then all of our
notions of causality go out the window 

3013
02:16:24,190 --> 02:16:25,680
because we all depend on but before and 
after to decide causes and effects.

3014
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:30,800
But if there was no before,
then we have to change our notions of a 

3015
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:30,800
cause and,
and that's awful.

3016
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:32,080
But Hey,
that's what we call learning.

3017
02:16:32,770 --> 02:16:35,980
What about the idea is that the universe
is in a constant state of contraction?

3018
02:16:35,981 --> 02:16:36,490
No,
it isn't.

3019
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:39,640
And well,
I mean some people think that no,

3020
02:16:39,670 --> 02:16:44,670
it's not been abandoned.
Some physicists will argue that there's 

3021
02:16:44,670 --> 02:16:44,770
a cycle because it looks nice and they 
aren't.

3022
02:16:45,070 --> 02:16:50,070
I think most of most people,
I mean there's some people who are 

3023
02:16:50,070 --> 02:16:50,590
arguing for that pitch something neat.
Well,

3024
02:16:50,591 --> 02:16:55,591
I think they're trying to type their 
ignorance in something that isn't any 

3025
02:16:55,591 --> 02:16:56,170
more plausible than the picture that 
expands forever.

3026
02:16:56,520 --> 02:17:01,520
And as far as we can tell,
the most likely possibilities that our 

3027
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:02,950
university will expand forever fought to
make you a little bit happier.

3028
02:17:03,350 --> 02:17:06,910
It's quite possible.
The best pictures that we have of our,

3029
02:17:06,930 --> 02:17:07,390
of,
of,

3030
02:17:07,460 --> 02:17:09,930
of the early years is that we actually 
are universities.

3031
02:17:10,300 --> 02:17:12,670
Unique isn't alone,
that there are many universes,

3032
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:17,970
we call it a multiverse and that at any 
instant in time and kind of a cosmic 

3033
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:23,280
super time,
there's always university being born so 

3034
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:25,390
that that multi-verse might be,
might be infinite and eternal.

3035
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:27,880
Where are they outside of our universe?
Oh,

3036
02:17:27,910 --> 02:17:28,830
how's that?
Even possible.

3037
02:17:28,831 --> 02:17:29,860
How?
Of course it's possible.

3038
02:17:29,890 --> 02:17:32,070
I understand.
Okay.

3039
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:32,440
No,
no.

3040
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:34,510
Well,
first of all,

3041
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:39,660
the simplest possibility is that there 
outside the region we can see right for,

3042
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:40,870
for,
for example,

3043
02:17:40,871 --> 02:17:45,871
the edges of our visible universe space 
is expanding faster away from us than 

3044
02:17:45,871 --> 02:17:47,760
light because you know,
we taught you in school.

3045
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:51,070
Nothing can travel faster than light and
you may remember that we lied.

3046
02:17:51,270 --> 02:17:52,100
Oh,
okay.

3047
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:54,400
Well No,
you have to parse it more carefully.

3048
02:17:54,401 --> 02:17:59,401
Like a lawyer.
Nothing can travel through space faster 

3049
02:17:59,401 --> 02:18:02,371
than light,
but space can do whatever the hell it 

3050
02:18:02,371 --> 02:18:02,371
wants.
So locally,

3051
02:18:02,371 --> 02:18:03,160
as I told you though,
radio host is,

3052
02:18:03,380 --> 02:18:08,380
is at rest,
they're not moving and the other end of 

3053
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:08,620
the galaxy at the other end of the 
visible universe and we're at rest,

3054
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:12,040
but the space between us is expanding.
So that galaxy,

3055
02:18:12,041 --> 02:18:17,041
like a surfer is being carried away from
us faster than light relative to the 

3056
02:18:17,041 --> 02:18:19,390
water.
The surfer isn't moving right,

3057
02:18:19,391 --> 02:18:22,420
but relative to the shore,
the surfer is right,

3058
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:23,470
right.
Okay.

3059
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:28,710
So this,
this galaxy is not moving relative to 

3060
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:30,340
its local surroundings,
but it's moving away from us faster than

3061
02:18:30,341 --> 02:18:32,500
light.
And like a surfer in an undertow,

3062
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:37,890
they can swim really fast in the water,
but if the water's moving away from the 

3063
02:18:37,890 --> 02:18:40,981
shore,
they'll let me take it back to the 

3064
02:18:40,981 --> 02:18:40,981
shore.

3065
02:18:40,981 --> 02:18:40,981
Right.
And so that galaxy,

3066
02:18:40,981 --> 02:18:43,240
the light from that galaxy is traveling 
through space at the speed of light,

3067
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:46,420
but it's the space in between us and the
galaxies moving faster than light.

3068
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:48,580
Then the poor like can never make it to 
us.

3069
02:18:48,970 --> 02:18:52,270
We call that a horizon.
Wow.

3070
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:57,390
So the space is traveling too far for 
the light to reach us so fast.

3071
02:18:58,610 --> 02:19:03,610
The two spaces too fast.
So the light can't catch up with the 

3072
02:19:03,610 --> 02:19:06,781
expansion of space and it never gets to 
us and that that galaxy disappears from 

3073
02:19:07,691 --> 02:19:11,590
our causal horizon.
We call it will never be able to see.

3074
02:19:11,591 --> 02:19:16,591
It will never be able to interact with,
it will never be okay and it could be 

3075
02:19:16,591 --> 02:19:19,180
that that there are different regions so
far away from us.

3076
02:19:19,570 --> 02:19:21,610
We're space is expanding faster than 
light,

3077
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:25,300
which which have a very different 
history than our own,

3078
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:28,220
so there could be space,
could be infinite,

3079
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:33,250
just our simple unit space that we know 
of and love could be infinite in extent 

3080
02:19:33,350 --> 02:19:38,350
and different regions of that space had 
different histories and some of those 

3081
02:19:38,350 --> 02:19:38,350
regions.

3082
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:41,870
Everything we can see we know emerged 
from a single point.

3083
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:43,670
Okay,
we can tell that.

3084
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:48,850
We can tell that by measuring the big 
bang expansion of everything we see and 

3085
02:19:48,850 --> 02:19:51,971
working backwards and the university 
that our visible universe was once 

3086
02:19:51,971 --> 02:19:52,640
smaller and smaller and smaller.
If you go back in time,

3087
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:57,820
we can actually follow the laws of 
physics back to the earliest moments of 

3088
02:19:57,820 --> 02:20:00,881
the big bang until those laws break down
and we can make predictions about the 

3089
02:20:00,881 --> 02:20:01,700
university would look like.
All those predictions agree exactly what

3090
02:20:01,701 --> 02:20:04,400
the observations we make,
which tell us that that picture works,

3091
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:06,260
but another region,
if you wish,

3092
02:20:06,261 --> 02:20:07,670
could have come from a different big 
bang,

3093
02:20:08,390 --> 02:20:11,060
but is that another universe or is it a 
part of the university?

3094
02:20:11,070 --> 02:20:16,070
We see,
here's how we've changed and this is 

3095
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:16,070
semantics,
but nontrivial semantics,

3096
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:19,680
namely when I was a kid,
universe meant everything.

3097
02:20:19,700 --> 02:20:24,700
Everything right,
but we say that's it's pretty stupid 

3098
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:26,981
definition.
A better definition is an operational 

3099
02:20:26,981 --> 02:20:28,700
one.
Universe means that region of space with

3100
02:20:28,701 --> 02:20:33,701
which at one time we could have 
communicated or one time in the future 

3101
02:20:33,701 --> 02:20:38,501
even if the future is infinite,
we might communicate with because that 

3102
02:20:38,501 --> 02:20:42,461
describes the region of space we're 
causing effect works some measurable 

3103
02:20:42,531 --> 02:20:43,580
distance.
Yes,

3104
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:48,790
and so that art we think of the universe
is that region which could throughout 

3105
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:53,170
which everything could affect everything
else ultimately in an infinitely long 

3106
02:20:53,170 --> 02:20:57,011
time and in that picture,
universes can be restricted in size and 

3107
02:20:59,451 --> 02:21:04,451
then other regions which could never 
have affected us and which will never 

3108
02:21:04,451 --> 02:21:08,111
affect us in the future.
We call other universes a and when and 

3109
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:10,460
now there are many different versions of
a multiverse,

3110
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:14,450
but that's the simplest version.
And this picture we call inflation,

3111
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:15,830
which,
uh,

3112
02:21:15,970 --> 02:21:16,770
you know,
I talk,

3113
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:19,460
I just did two little clips associated 
with the new book,

3114
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:23,930
one for us for a publisher and one was 
for big think one is a,

3115
02:21:24,230 --> 02:21:26,420
the universe and under two minutes so 
you can look up online,

3116
02:21:26,421 --> 02:21:31,421
looked for Lawrence Krauss,
explains the universe in under two 

3117
02:21:31,421 --> 02:21:33,161
minutes where I talk about this cosmic 
expansion and how it might mean there's 

3118
02:21:33,161 --> 02:21:33,470
a multiverse,
but the other is,

3119
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:38,510
um,
explain the universe in terms of this 

3120
02:21:38,510 --> 02:21:38,510
beer bottle that I talked about you 
earlier.

3121
02:21:38,510 --> 02:21:39,290
So you can,
that's a video.

3122
02:21:39,291 --> 02:21:42,140
You can watch that.
But at this theory of inflation,

3123
02:21:42,141 --> 02:21:44,940
which actually says our universal,
the qual,

3124
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:50,110
the qualities that we see of our 
universe can best be explained if some 

3125
02:21:50,110 --> 02:21:53,440
early time in the history of the 
universe when it was a billionth of a 

3126
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:55,250
billionth of a billionth,
of a billionth of a second old.

3127
02:21:55,850 --> 02:22:00,850
It had a huge expansion suddenly and 
increased in size by 30 orders of 

3128
02:22:00,850 --> 02:22:05,140
magnitude in size.
In a billionth of a billionth of a 

3129
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:05,140
billionth,
of a billionth of a second,

3130
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:10,030
which is by the way particle physics 
suggests is highly plausible even 

3131
02:22:10,030 --> 02:22:10,190
though,
okay,

3132
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:15,520
and then and then,
and then it would produce a universe 

3133
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:15,970
that looks more or less like we look 
like you look like and,

3134
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:21,280
and uh,
and it's right now the only explanation 

3135
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:21,830
of how that would cause the university 
to look like,

3136
02:22:22,070 --> 02:22:22,550
what it looks like.

3137
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:25,620
But the neat thing about inflation is 
it's eternal.

3138
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:29,310
So inflation that puffing up ended in 
our universe.

3139
02:22:29,311 --> 02:22:30,090
And then boom,
a hot,

3140
02:22:30,091 --> 02:22:31,530
big bang followed it.
Okay.

3141
02:22:31,531 --> 02:22:36,531
So the region,
the universe universe puffed up by huge 

3142
02:22:36,531 --> 02:22:38,220
amount than all of that energy which was
stored and empty space got released like

3143
02:22:38,230 --> 02:22:42,000
the beer bottle and we got a hot,
big bang and the rest is history,

3144
02:22:42,450 --> 02:22:47,450
but that's locally,
but somewhere else between us and their 

3145
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:51,660
space is still expanding exponentially 
and faster and faster and faster.

3146
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:54,060
And only maybe somewhere else today.
Boom.

3147
02:22:54,090 --> 02:22:59,090
Like an ice crystal forming boom.
That that region of space is suddenly 

3148
02:22:59,090 --> 02:23:01,740
left inflation and maybe a guilt a 
gazillion years in the future,

3149
02:23:01,741 --> 02:23:04,200
there'll be another region of space 
that's expanding away from it,

3150
02:23:04,201 --> 02:23:09,201
so much faster than light.
So we'll never know about it where 

3151
02:23:09,201 --> 02:23:09,330
suddenly that region leads inflation and
boom,

3152
02:23:09,331 --> 02:23:14,331
another hot big bang happens and it 
turns out in each of those hot big 

3153
02:23:14,331 --> 02:23:15,420
bangs,
after the inflation ends,

3154
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:20,540
depending upon how it ends,
the laws of physics could be different 

3155
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:21,210
in that universe.
And that's what we tend to think.

3156
02:23:21,211 --> 02:23:26,211
It's quite likely that there are many,
many separate regions of space and in 

3157
02:23:26,311 --> 02:23:31,311
fact it's eternal.
So such regions are forming eternally 

3158
02:23:31,311 --> 02:23:31,460
for all time and,
and,

3159
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:36,590
and there are hot,
big bangs happening in many regions and 

3160
02:23:36,590 --> 02:23:39,381
the properties of each of those regions,
whether they're conducive to forming 

3161
02:23:39,381 --> 02:23:42,300
galaxies and stars and planets and 
people may be different.

3162
02:23:42,301 --> 02:23:47,301
So we could say logically in that 
picture that the reason the universe 

3163
02:23:47,301 --> 02:23:49,950
looks like the way it does is because 
we're here to measure it.

3164
02:23:53,290 --> 02:23:55,210
Oh my God,
we should leave it at that.

3165
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:56,610
Okay.
We should close with that.

3166
02:23:56,611 --> 02:23:59,620
That is the mindblower wind blowers.
Wow,

3167
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:01,380
I'm glad I wore you out.
Not the other way around.

3168
02:24:01,390 --> 02:24:03,130
Was amazing.
Thank you so much.

3169
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:04,770
Fun fact mandated.
Again,

3170
02:24:04,850 --> 02:24:06,030
that's two and a half hours,
man.

3171
02:24:06,070 --> 02:24:07,660
Just by good.
Thanks.

3172
02:24:07,690 --> 02:24:12,690
Wow.
Thank you for you and me and my have 

3173
02:24:12,690 --> 02:24:12,690
flown by.
I don't know how the little strip.

3174
02:24:12,690 --> 02:24:12,900
Listen man,
that that was a mindblower.

3175
02:24:12,940 --> 02:24:15,760
Okay.
Thank greatest story ever told so far.

3176
02:24:15,790 --> 02:24:18,100
It's available now.
You can get it an audio books.

3177
02:24:18,101 --> 02:24:23,101
It's on a.
You can get it on itunes and an audio 

3178
02:24:23,101 --> 02:24:23,101
book form as well.
Thank you very much.

3179
02:24:23,101 --> 02:24:23,380
Really,
really appreciate it.

3180
02:24:23,381 --> 02:24:25,120
It's been great to finally get to talk 
to you.

3181
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:27,330
I really appreciate this.
Thank you.
