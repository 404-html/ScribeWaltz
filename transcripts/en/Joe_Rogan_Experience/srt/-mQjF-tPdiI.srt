1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,883
Mm,

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,550
and we live.
Yeah.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,900
What are you doing over there,
Joey?

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,320
Just looking at your book.
I've been reading that book lately.

5
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:18,230
This message one,
which one I even talked about on the

6
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:21,650
podcast,
the war of art resistance.

7
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:24,410
So now I catch myself every time I'm.
I want to do something.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,200
I catch myself.
I've been practicing for look at the

9
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:31,190
resistance levels that comes up like
different things I need to do.

10
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:33,740
I want to see what excuse I get myself.
Yeah,

11
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,090
yeah.
It's a normal thing,

12
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:39,370
right?
Normal Ms dot white brother.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,510
Very nice to meet you.
Coming down here man.

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,390
I hear the fantastic things about you
from Joey,

15
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:46,820
from other people.
So Joey insisted.

16
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:48,380
He's like,
you've got to get this guy in.

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,570
He had dog.
He's a fucking wizard.

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,260
What he did for my shoulders.
What?

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,650
What did he do for your shoulders?
You know,

20
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,630
I've been going to Alberto.

21
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,770
Alberto Alberto cranes is the man in
Burbank for tactical fitness.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,820
Right?
They do it in the mornings in the

23
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:08,420
afternoon,
but the one kid coach Robert,

24
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,480
you know,
after class he would say,

25
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:12,860
Joe,
what are you gonna do you gonna go home

26
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:16,010
or you want to do this for a little
while and at first or first two weeks

27
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:18,590
the movements were difficult,
but then,

28
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,970
you know,
level one stuff,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,320
man,
any age could do it.

30
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,540
If I could do it.
Just laying on the back,

31
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,590
lifting your hips and spending over on
your toes and doing it back.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,880
And at first I couldn't even look Joe.
I couldn't move my elbows like that.

33
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,080
Nothing.
My shoulders,

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,080
my wrists,
and I kept staying for the 30 minute

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,880
thing.
Five exercises,

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,520
three minutes apiece.
That's it.

37
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,400
No drama.
You could be big,

38
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,800
heavy.
It's all stuff I could do.

39
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:49,310
Picking up your leg,
putting it on body weight or body

40
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,660
weight,
stuff that I can handle.

41
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,570
If I can handle it on my risk being 300
pounds,

42
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,700
anybody can handle it.
Simple stuff.

43
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,460
And one day I was getting caught and
like,

44
00:01:58,461 --> 00:02:01,380
uh,
the guy was pulling me into his guard

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,400
and magically my hips flew up and I just
mysteriously gotten to site control and

46
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:08,900
I,
something made me look up and Alberto

47
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:12,530
cranes jaw dropped and he goes,
that's from doing that stuff.

48
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,840
You couldn't do that when you walked in
here.

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,480
But I kept going to these 30 minute
things.

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,090
Thirty minute five exercises,
three minutes.

51
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,400
You're out of there at 1:45.
So it was this a,

52
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:23,360
uh,
like a.

53
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,500
do you have like a system that you bring
to a bunch of different places and you

54
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,150
have a affiliates?
Is that work?

55
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,750
I'm going us right up to you.
Alright,

56
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,110
sorry.
I suppose that for me.

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,160
Have you ever done a podcast?
You speak fantastic English for someone

58
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,450
who's from Italy,
right?

59
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:39,580
Thanks.
I believe in.

60
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,870
I lived here years ago,
years ago,

61
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,000
got married years ago.
Spent some time,

62
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,860
be careful.
Trump might kick you out now.

63
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,510
You got to be super careful.
I already been out back in Europe.

64
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,200
Oh,
okay.

65
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,090
Yeah.
So I'm representing this system has been

66
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,213
by Asana.

67
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,421
Oh Scott.
Simon.

68
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,270
So it's like

69
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,490
cloud that CSD,
uh,

70
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:09,310
we meet each other a long time ago in
[inaudible] 94 and then,

71
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,430
um,
I was doing contractor work that's worth

72
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,790
my time of businesses design.
I've always been involved in training

73
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,360
martial art and any kind of training and
that,

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,410
you know,
or the injury that got for competing and

75
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,610
normal weight lifting and I'd been lost
contact with him for a few years and

76
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:32,890
then I saw him in 2000 and coming out
with the clubbers club has really

77
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,950
attracted me.
It was a different tools and I say,

78
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:36,430
okay,
I want,

79
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,840
I,
I'll give you bake in concert with these

80
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,060
guys.
I want to understand how can they,

81
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,630
can help it.
So I went back to him and he blew my

82
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:46,150
mind,
blew my mind and helped me to get back

83
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,700
into the best shape of my life.
You know,

84
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:52,390
I feel now in 47 feet I can move better
and do better than I used to do it when

85
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,224
I was 20.

86
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,300
So I promised him,
you know,

87
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,910
I'm going to make these things happen in
Europe or you want me,

88
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:00,280
my coach,
you changed my fee,

89
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,020
my way to see fitness and I got to do
that.

90
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,130
So between my job and security I was
introducing this to my teams,

91
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,430
to my teams and then I see changing on
people,

92
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,700
people being able even to just to go,
moving easier,

93
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:16,810
you know,
and then transfer to whatever it was,

94
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,250
our training and Ghana or wherever
skiers and stop everything was easier.

95
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,180
So I start to believe,
start to believe basically,

96
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,800
and I start to say,
okay,

97
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:31,540
I want to help more people that I can in
my line of duty in the army because I

98
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:36,520
still don't have a different contract as
a consultant in the army.

99
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:39,890
Back home has a physical trainer and
some time out.

100
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,830
So non combat training and I start to
introduce these things from barely cry

101
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,210
because the system is very complex as
they were.

102
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,270
Joe was talking about is all the
mobility.

103
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,070
Yeah.
Mobility is a big.

104
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,410
It's a big factor because there's for so
long,

105
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:57,590
people have just been concentrating on
getting stronger or getting in great

106
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:58,560
shape,
but I,

107
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,320
you know,
I know people that are in fantastic

108
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,340
shape,
they can run forever,

109
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,700
but they could barely touch their toes
and you,

110
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,600
you,
you developed these bodies that are

111
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:09,380
severely limited in the amount of motion
that you can actually get out of your

112
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:11,960
body in certain motions.
You're really good.

113
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,710
You know,
you could,

114
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,300
you might be explosive with a bench
press,

115
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:15,860
you might,
you might have a great run,

116
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,740
but whatever else you're doing to your
body,

117
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,560
you're compromising all of your overall
mobility.

118
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,340
So over the last few years has been a
tremendous amount of concentration and

119
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,220
effort by a bunch of different trainers.
Kelly start,

120
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,840
he's a.
he's done a lot.

121
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,380
Kelly's done a lot of work and his book
becoming a supple Leopard.

122
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,520
Excellent book on that and Kelly has a
great instagram you can follow to and

123
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,290
what he's done is he's done an amazing
job in highlighting mobility and how

124
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,410
important mobility and just having a
full range of motion,

125
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,530
which seems so simple,
but it's not something that most people

126
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:51,320
really concentrate on.
Most people are concentrating on getting

127
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,950
stronger,
more deadlift,

128
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,410
more bench press,
more this,

129
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:56,300
more that,
but you're compromising all of these

130
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:58,280
different areas.
Your body absolutely

131
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,870
agree with you.
That's,

132
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,450
that's from the right,
right there.

133
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,600
This ball,
that ball right there is the um,

134
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,780
it's,
it's one of those,

135
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,210
I think he calls it the Wad.
Supernova.

136
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,010
Supernovas.
So I got that one too.

137
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,560
It seems like nothing.
But when you roll around and find this

138
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,530
spot,
release tension on your Fascia.

139
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,810
Yeah,
put that on the ground.

140
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,920
And I do like bridges on it.
I lie on my back on it and I put all my

141
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:24,590
weight on that ball for people just
listening.

142
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,950
It's a rubber ball that's like the size
of a softball and it's really hard and

143
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:32,150
it's got like this textured outer
surface.

144
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,140
And Kelly developed this to,
uh,

145
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,130
to help you.
He also uses lacrosse balls.

146
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,230
That's what I start out with.
But then I think that's a little bit

147
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,770
better than a Lacrosse ball.
I take one of those everywhere with me

148
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:43,580
on the road.

149
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,250
Every time I go in a hotel room that
goes in my bag period.

150
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,980
Like there's no.
Because if I work out I get stiff.

151
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:51,620
If I got something locked up,
I need that fucking thing.

152
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,970
That's what I have to in my bag because
it will to travel and flight flight.

153
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,450
My deaf friends being back,
my lower back have the same problem.

154
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,080
I find those links.
Went to St.

155
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,400
Yeah.
Like say Joe,

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
what is the bodies were the things years
ago to take a unit of my community,

157
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,290
you know,
working with the army or stuff like

158
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:12,801
that.
They say,

159
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,120
oh,
we're going to do mobility.

160
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,390
They will look at you like,
do we really need that?

161
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,580
You know,
the old tough guy,

162
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,620
you know,
the old thinking about need something to

163
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,720
get myself stronger and faster.
Yeah.

164
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,910
But they don't get it.
They don't get a few who don't allow

165
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,950
yourself to regain their mobility.

166
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,780
Yes.
They used to push to have.

167
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,370
At one point you're going to be stuck.
You're going to be reaching blood door,

168
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:36,080
you're going to get injured and you're
going to lose those guys in the field.

169
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,820
That was my point and I think the system
that this got created was smart enough

170
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:41,654
to say,
you know what?

171
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,790
I got introduced this slowly underneath
because they give you this amount of

172
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,420
mobility that I w what you want when you
want to have that intensity workout,

173
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,980
okay,
should I give you that I intend to do

174
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:53,630
about that doctorate,
I intensity,

175
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,280
but you're going to teach you how to
recover for the poor performance faster,

176
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,320
and then I get introduced to Libya of
Yoga,

177
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,150
so you're gonna.
Feel better.

178
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,600
Loosen up when you live in and day by
day,

179
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,360
those guys,
they on understood and they started

180
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,194
telling me,
you know what?

181
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,810
We like the workout,
but what we feel we need to be able to

182
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,010
move the shoot that again,
to be able to carry a backpack again and

183
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:19,520
now everybody wants to do mobility more
than workout because you can kill

184
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:22,140
yourself in the workout.
You don't even need to kill.

185
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,230
You just throw the days and decide to be
a push up and that they don't need to

186
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,570
really someone to drive you.
Here.

187
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,650
People are understanding now that it's
a.

188
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:35,600
it's a huge deal and yoga is huge.
For me.

189
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,440
That's one of the reasons why I still
use that Supernova ball,

190
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,070
but man,
Yoga has had a tremendous effect on my

191
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:44,840
back.
Is that a tremendous effects on

192
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,910
everything?
My overall flexibility is better than

193
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:50,630
it's been in a long time since I was a
kid and I just feel better.

194
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,980
Just feels like everything moves better,
you know?

195
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,460
But you say yoga to and they go,
ah,

196
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,540
you fucking pussy.
How come they're doing dead lifts?

197
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,680
You need to do fucking hill sprints.
You know,

198
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:03,780
everybody wants to do something that
looks like tough guy.

199
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,400
Stuff that looks awesome on your
instagram.

200
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,550
You know,
everybody wants to do dead lifts for

201
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,570
fucking full of 50,
but the reality is if your body has any

202
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,980
weak links,
yoga,

203
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,020
we'll find those links,
show it,

204
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,930
show it right away.
I was shocked like,

205
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,560
you know what the big one for me was my
feet and then this is something that

206
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,590
nick curse onset as well.
Nick [inaudible],

207
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,720
who is a really well respected strength
and conditioning coach,

208
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,670
a speed of sport down in,
uh,

209
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,590
I think he's in Huntington beach
somewhere in Orange County,

210
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,510
but he trains a Joe Schilling Hoffeld
dos Anjos,

211
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,040
Fabrizio,
Verdugo pick time,

212
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:43,390
MMA fighters and kick boxers and works
with Aaron Peko was a top level wrestler

213
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:48,960
and just a long line of like real high
level combat sports athletes.

214
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,130
And I asked him,
I go,

215
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,960
what do you think that the one thing
that a lot of athletes have that is

216
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,330
something they need to improve on?
He said,

217
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,590
feet strength.
Nobody says that.

218
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,270
Nobody says that.
Everybody's like,

219
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,340
work on your cardio,
work on your explosiveness.

220
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,380
You got to be able to,
you know,

221
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,790
fucking throw more kettle bells around.
He was like,

222
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,920
your feet,
like you think about it,

223
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:11,010
your emotion,
like if you can't move out of the way or

224
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,960
towards your opponent,
you're useless.

225
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,910
Right?
If your foot's broken in a fight,

226
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,440
you're severely limited and one of the
things that I found out almost instantly

227
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,240
when I started doing yoga and when I
started skiing,

228
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,910
my fucking feet would be killing me in
the beginning.

229
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,380
Skiing was because my boots were too
small because I have really wide feet so

230
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,580
my feet would be smashed in there and it
sucked and I was like,

231
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,840
well fuck skiing.

232
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,140
I can't do it.
My feet are too wide.

233
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,580
Then I got boots that are made for a
wider feet and they fit,

234
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:40,260
but my feet would still hurt.
After awhile I was like,

235
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,030
what the fuck is wrong with my damn
feet?

236
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,730
Maybe it's just because my feet are flat
and I'm just going to have to deal with

237
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:45,564
that.
No.

238
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,060
As soon as I started doing yoga,
now I can ski all day.

239
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,820
It doesn't bother me at all.
As long as I'm doing yoga twice a week,

240
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,180
all that foot problems are gone.
They're out the window because a

241
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,340
balance.
It's pretty funny because I was watching

242
00:10:56,341 --> 00:11:00,060
you flow video the other night right
before I came on because I didn't have.

243
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,960
I wanted to be able to contribute in
this conversation.

244
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:08,130
You guys are to level genius for me,
so if you want just flow video.

245
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:11,760
The first thing he put on some shoes
with toes with them and you're talking

246
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:14,010
about the feet.
That's before you do anything.

247
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,580
He started stretching his feet and I
could see him playing with his toes and

248
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,211
I'm like,
you know,

249
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:22,400
I guess this is the.
I think it was going to say and it's

250
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,860
saying this,
but this has got to be just pulled

251
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,910
around and be great.

252
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,150
Is there anything.
You know what I mean?

253
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,680
Everything.
Everybody don't think about it because

254
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,410
we stand in our fit so we think we're
connected to the earth.

255
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,860
We are not.
We just post this one on the table but

256
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,930
he's not connected and move around,
but it has no control.

257
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,520
We're building the capability to grow,
grabbing the ground,

258
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,640
understand the stability of the food,
the mobility of the tours,

259
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,110
and the ankle mobility is mandatory
because I'm going to transfer power

260
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,010
through my fit engagement to the

261
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,850
ground,
to my leg,

262
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,940
drive to my hips to enter my core.
So everything comes from the hurt.

263
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,930
These shoes make everybody look gay.
Uh,

264
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,800
yeah man.
There's no way around the shoes.

265
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,110
I love them.
They're very functional,

266
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,140
but they're not sexy at all.
I will never get married with us.

267
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,340
Well,
I always know the real weirdos when I

268
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,080
catch them out at night and they're
wearing them,

269
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,060
you know,
if you catch a guy like at a bar and

270
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,860
he's wearing those shoes,
that's a real weirdo.

271
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,480
But there's people that do wear though.
Is that your gym?

272
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,600
What gym is that?
My exec said Jim.

273
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,610
Yeah.
As the gym that I'm dealing with,

274
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,220
I'm working with in Europe.
That's the,

275
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,030
that's my headquarters say in Europe.
So it's a,

276
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,110
it's my dream.
So this is all what we're looking at

277
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:36,490
here.
What's the name of this video?

278
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,290
Jamie?
Flow fit,

279
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,341
flow,
fit,

280
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,690
tactic.
Flow fit.

281
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,130
Alberto.
Gutsy.

282
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,390
Vibram five fingers,
so you sponsored by Vibram or I'm an.

283
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,320
I'm an ambassador for them and I'm a and
that's a very low profile one.

284
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:53,320
It has a very small amount of tread at
the bottom of it.

285
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,250
Right.
It's very thin.

286
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,200
The one that you've got on because there
are different,

287
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,340
different type,
different types.

288
00:12:57,341 --> 00:13:01,800
Some of them are for trail running.
I tried to work with them to,

289
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,300
to,
to realize something specifically for

290
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,660
flow because sometime when they have
uber on the side.

291
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,460
Yeah,
so specifically flow.

292
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:13,150
Especially if we want to focus on your
knee and understanding of my knee and my

293
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:15,190
hips work,
they get too much friction.

294
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,160
So why do you use that instead of a
barefoot?

295
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,580
I go,
I have to donate it.

296
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,310
Like you felt you wanted to really go
freestyle and move around.

297
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,220
You know,
I go freestyle go barefoot,

298
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,820
but food,
there's no traction but some.

299
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,293
But it's,
you know,

300
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,620
if I train them like a Doosan time in
the concrete,

301
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,660
I need somebody to really protect them
in dirt and rocks and stuff.

302
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:39,370
Like that.
Years ago you told me one of your

303
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:43,150
biggest failures was getting old and
feeling weak,

304
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,640
you know,
and then you and I traveled a lot

305
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:46,630
together.
A lot of places.

306
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:50,440
We would go to Jujitsu places and we'd
see the Jujitsu Guy,

307
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:53,140
the main guy,
and he'd be walking a little funny.

308
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,690
Yeah,
they're all fucked up or he be.

309
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:59,570
And that always stuck out,
stuck out in my mind like why love

310
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:04,210
something so much in my sixties,
I'm going to be limping or walking

311
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:08,410
different and I think this is maybe the
so help.

312
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:11,020
That definitely helped that I think.
Yeah,

313
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:13,720
that's one of the reasons why it has
gotten so into yoga too and he's doing

314
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:17,440
yoga three times a week now and he
realizes that after he had back surgery,

315
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,460
you know what I mean?

316
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,950
Once you,
when people get older in particular,

317
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:23,680
you start realizing the limitations of
some of the things that you're doing.

318
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:26,860
You're putting tremendous stress on your
body in very specific areas,

319
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,320
especially Jujitsu.
You're attacking the joints all the

320
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:30,820
time.
You're attacking the joints,

321
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,910
you're attacking your neck and almost
everybody that I know either has a back

322
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,580
problem or some sort of a knee problem
or a neck problem.

323
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,230
It's just a constant issue when it comes
to Jujitsu and I feel like the only way

324
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:43,840
to mitigate that as first of all roll
with people that you know,

325
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,970
like people that you know,
they're good people.

326
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:48,340
They're not going to try to hurt you.
They're not crazy.

327
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,010
It's not even their fault,
but young people in could get like some

328
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,010
young 20 year old kid is all full of
fucking just come and just some little

329
00:14:57,201 --> 00:15:00,500
animal they want to kill.
They want to kill a young guy.

330
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:03,210
When they roll,
they roll fucking full clip and you you

331
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,620
could get a knee caught in a scramble
and it gets ripped apart.

332
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:09,110
It's a super common,
so you gotta be real careful.

333
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,530
The kind of people you work out with,
make sure that people aren't gonna Yank

334
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:14,260
on an arm bar,
a knee bar,

335
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,820
he'll hook or something like that.
That's big,

336
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:19,490
but also I think that improving your
mobility,

337
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:20,630
like dude,
there's so many times.

338
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:25,550
I would go to class and I would be stiff
before I walked in the door right before

339
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,320
I walked in the door.
My back would be fucked up.

340
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:32,310
I'd get more up in the morning.
My back would be just be stiff and then

341
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:33,560
it get in there and start warming up.

342
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,910
But Jujitsu,
so fun.

343
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,900
As soon as you get in there,
you just do a little few movements.

344
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:42,980
He started coming in on flammatory,
so you ready to go?

345
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,890
Next thing you know,
you'll like slap hands and you fucking

346
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,590
go into Oregon and then you got a worse
back.

347
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,750
Then you've got a worse name.
That's how I fucked up my back.

348
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,360
I didn't just fuck it up in one thing.
If I had.

349
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:55,940
That was one incident that had got
injured in,

350
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:59,330
I could have eventually healed it.
What I did was I just kept doing it.

351
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,610
Even when I was still hurt.
I would keep God,

352
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:03,670
God just go light.
I never went light.

353
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,430
Still go back in there and go hard again
and then fucks it up more.

354
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,240
It's.
I think that we have to be super aware

355
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,300
that our body is a precious resource and
you got to treat it almost

356
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:19,040
scientifically instead of looking at it
like,

357
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,530
you know,
guys like to do curls and bench presses

358
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,960
because I mean,
how many times have you seen that where

359
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:27,350
you see a guy with a meatball upper body
with little toothpick at the bottom

360
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:29,060
that's holding them up with his legs.

361
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,970
Like you see guys are certain guys you
see at the gym and you go,

362
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:34,040
you poor bastard.
Like what are you doing to yourself?

363
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,700
Like you think everything looks good.
He's got these big biceps and big chest,

364
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,130
but your lower body is virtually
useless,

365
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,470
you know,
because they don't live.

366
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,790
They don't live with their lower body.
They don't do anything with it.

367
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,610
You don't.
She got to treat your body like,

368
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,410
like it's a big old science project.
You know,

369
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,720
like the.
You have to look at it scientifically.

370
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,820
What I.
When people ask me,

371
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,380
what do you think?
You know what I think,

372
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,830
what is the project that I'm not going
to train you?

373
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,050
I'm thinking,
oh,

374
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,780
it was that everybody of us,
we know what is our point b.

375
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,540
So if I asked you when you come to the
gym,

376
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,080
what is Yoga?
Most of the,

377
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,300
especially young people,
they know I want to be.

378
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,780
Nobody's my point be I want to become a
foster,

379
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,410
a stronger leaner,
whatever you say,

380
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,850
point b,
point a to point B.

381
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,870
Yeah.
We don't really know what is our point

382
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,050
a,
we think we know what we don't know.

383
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:26,051
We don't know what's going on inside our
truck about estrogen and testosterone

384
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,850
and cortisol,
whatever.

385
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,270
We don't know exactly over the Fascia
has asked me to set up with us.

386
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,920
If you don't think about that,
we never going to reach point and oh

387
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,740
probably we're going to reach it,
but going zigzag instead to go straight

388
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,930
line and we're going to face in what
injury plateau.

389
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,320
Back to the,
you know,

390
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,310
imbalances imbalances.
So that's why I think the difficult.

391
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,100
Something like yoga is very important.
It highlights those

392
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,770
imbalances.
It seems like this kind of particular

393
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,720
motion,
like your flow like that up there.

394
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,480
That would also highlight those
particular modules.

395
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,550
I see.
I see flow like for me at the beginning

396
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,241
of everything.
Why?

397
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,710
Because you go through the lab or joint
mobility and then you start to connect

398
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,710
to exercise logically and connected to
what challenges your breathing so you're

399
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,070
breathing will tell you exactly when
you're forcing your brain to some of the

400
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,560
moment.
You should start to understand the

401
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,810
investigative.
Why do I force through this range of

402
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:19,260
motion?
Probably something is stiff for me.

403
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,200
Maybe my giant might be my Fascia.
Whatever it does allow me to flow

404
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,590
through one one to the other moment
because I'm working six degree.

405
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:28,770
I don't just work in their life,
a yoga mat up and down,

406
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:33,320
left and right and just to roll jumper
score to wherever is my body she

407
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,440
supposed to be doing.

408
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,860
I look like,
like if you know the magic guys picture

409
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,903
for me,
the message guy,

410
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,380
Peter,
the one that you look and then you step

411
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:42,600
back and the guy picture.
For me,

412
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,510
it's the body.
You know when I see you standing or do a

413
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,580
couple of moment,
I can interpret that yourself a little

414
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:49,620
bit,
but when you move freestyle,

415
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,830
now I can understand exactly what what's
going on with you.

416
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,090
Do you drop your knee when you score 10
and do a.

417
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:57,000
You know you don't do.
Your feet is not connected.

418
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:00,690
You cannot talk your knee when you.
You can know even understanding loading

419
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,710
one side,
you need lateral power in order to

420
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:03,510
wildlife,
to the other.

421
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,330
So for information,
that's for me as a coach,

422
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:09,360
okay,
I start to plan out what should be doing

423
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,210
or kind of exercise.
What kind of strength training maybe is

424
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:17,211
neither for you more stability or more
more yoga because until you are already,

425
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,370
I wouldn't know like Chula lift to load
your body if your body's not able to in

426
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,420
your own way.

427
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,670
Well that's the thing.
Most people don't know what their body's

428
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:29,090
capable of doing like and there's a lot
of people that walk into any kind of a

429
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,630
classmate start working out and they
might not even know what deficiencies

430
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,150
they have because they've been
overcompensating for that.

431
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:36,240
Or compensating,
you know,

432
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,990
you might have something wrong with your
hip and because of that it's putting

433
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:41,180
extra pressures on your knee or you
know,

434
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,270
one side might be over.
That's one thing that you see with a lot

435
00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:46,190
of people that have done very specific
sports,

436
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,330
like they're very strong on one side and
then the other side of their body is

437
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:52,520
weak and when you do that,
you create these imbalances.

438
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,270
You can get some serious injuries
because

439
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,360
of that.
So we take it for granted.

440
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,520
The time you say,
okay,

441
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,050
I wish my shoulder is in pain,
but when I,

442
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,850
when I trade,
no good,

443
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,090
it's already the senior,
you know,

444
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:04,730
you're training what you're going to do.
Are you going to release the adrenaline

445
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,480
and cortisol and that.
Those are painkiller that they are

446
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,260
supposed to make you stronger.
You know,

447
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,180
fight in the freezer,
fight situation.

448
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:13,760
That's what is the endocrine system is
doing to you.

449
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,700
But after your training,
you got even worse than you to

450
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,660
understand that there's a coach.
You should be saying,

451
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,370
now what?
We need to fix that because it's no good

452
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,560
that you start training and working into
the pain because you were going to

453
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:28,700
create more raw material.
There is no neither into your body and

454
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:32,000
for me it's like holding this bottle
doesn't wait nothing today,

455
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,310
tomorrow,
but if I order for one hour,

456
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:38,780
this becoming heavy so we adapt to this
kind of similar and they didn't change

457
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:43,310
the level of the water in my butter,
but day after day is going to kill me,

458
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,860
but people don't understand because they
say,

459
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,580
oh,
I'm used to.

460
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,730
I used to do,
don't sleep.

461
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,990
Used to do,
don't eat enough.

462
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:52,210
I'm used to to,
to work in this pain.

463
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,780
That's not going to happen now.
What do you think is the biggest injury

464
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:59,200
that you deal with when you have clients
or people that you're working out with?

465
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,560
What's the most common as it shoulder,
shoulder and the shoulder?

466
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
More common those days,
especially because we,

467
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,170
we become,
we all grew up in the era that we all

468
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,053
want to,
you know,

469
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,780
pack and a stroller.
Now press presses and I believe our

470
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:17,310
shoulders are complex joint,
but it's not strong at all because we

471
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,100
were vertical animal,
not like chimpanzees.

472
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,610
The destructor is holding back.
The horse can hold a lot of power in the

473
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:25,940
shoulder,
the human,

474
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:28,180
be sure that it's just dropping on the
ribcage,

475
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,920
so awake and then simple question is,
are many of us can even stand,

476
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:35,740
just stand standing on the wall with the
feet on the wall.

477
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,480
Some people that can even hold their
weight,

478
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,790
give me.
You're saying to do handstands,

479
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,490
just even simple like that and how many
people,

480
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:45,010
even with the fit and the world can do
an instant press.

481
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,230
Yeah.
Not that many.

482
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:52,231
And if you ask how many of you,
10 or 10 out of 10 got shoulder injury

483
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,040
probably denied.
They say,

484
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,450
yeah,
I've got an issue since I've been in

485
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,660
school.
So wic is very complex.

486
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:01,390
A lot of tendons and ligaments,
multiple joints.

487
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,790
Do you incorporate a lot of hanging?
Um,

488
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,970
I think hanging is something that people
have been really concentrating on over

489
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:11,971
the last few years for shoulder mobility
and alleviating impingements absolutely.

490
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,200
And people listening to this,
if you have anything going on with your

491
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,110
shoulder,
some talent,

492
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:19,900
you grab a chin up bar and hanging from
that thing and just relaxes your

493
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:22,420
shoulder.
It stretches out your joints and there's

494
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:27,280
several doctors that stopped doing
shoulder surgeries and to alleviate pain

495
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:31,210
they've started doing hanging exercises
and prescribing hanging exercises.

496
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,310
It's amazing.
Just grab a chin up bar.

497
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,720
Start hanging from that soccer history
though.

498
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,800
He has the with the class structure 12,
but I got 11.

499
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,680
It's not like a formula.
The class I go back to the jump rope and

500
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,020
just to get oxygen power so I don't pass
out.

501
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,380
But Alberto come back,
they're like 11,

502
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,810
15 and give me homework assignments and
they're always different.

503
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:55,360
Joe,
like some days it's a steel club.

504
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,060
Sundays I'm just working on my hands and
knees and we incorporate our hips,

505
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,430
but some days he puts me on rings.
He goes,

506
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,820
you got rings at Your House,
Wrangler mastics rings.

507
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,640
I go,
what wall is going to hold me?

508
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:11,710
I mean,
he's got the whole thing and he just

509
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:14,530
taught me one thing too,
because my biggest weakness is my

510
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:18,050
breathing from the sleep apnea.
Like I even got hypnotized.

511
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,030
I mean,
I got to go tomorrow,

512
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,790
yet you got hypnotized,
been going to get hypnotized.

513
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,390
What's going on with the sleep apnea?
You ever wake up with your pants down?

514
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,840
No,
no,

515
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,530
no.
I got it.

516
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,480
Got So severe minds is such a bad case
from my machine broke a couple of weeks

517
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,400
ago.
My wife had to go pick up the machine

518
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:35,890
for me up in Logan.
The guy was saying,

519
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,180
how's Joey doing?
You know?

520
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,014
And he goes,
you know,

521
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,940
that til this day,
Joe,

522
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:44,390
he came in here as one of the worst
cases like Joe,

523
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,980
he was in bad shape.
You

524
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,970
remember what I was going through the
sleep on your steering wheel and,

525
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,330
and uh,
that sleep apnea,

526
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,490
like whenever my heart gets going and
Jujitsu like no other places,

527
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,000
my heart,
they're gone like that when I'm on the

528
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,210
bottom.
And that's all.

529
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,230
At first when I joined Jujitsu,
I overcame the panic attacks.

530
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,820
So I had to just go stand on the bottom,
like I forced myself to get on the

531
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,940
bottom.
I kept like a,

532
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,780
whatever you call it,
a bridge or whatever they call it a

533
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:15,140
frame and I breathe and I overcame my
fear.

534
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,320
But the other fear I had was when I get
to round up,

535
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,010
I can't control my breathing.
It's when I get up from their sleep

536
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,110
apnea.
So I just,

537
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:28,130
I kept thinking about something you said
about a couple of podcasts ago,

538
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:30,290
but a sports,
uh,

539
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,330
sports,
uh,

540
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,440
psychiatry is something.
Sports psychologist,

541
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:37,490
some people have it and I did some
reading and I said,

542
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,260
let me just go alleviate this last fit.

543
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,503
I mean,
how many feet you,

544
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,100
I got the needle for you.
But last week I got,

545
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,780
you know,
I still get that thing in my ear.

546
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,120
She stuck a needle in my ear.
Acupuncture,

547
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:50,150
they take the fluid out because my ear
is not letting my right,

548
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,500
my left ear,
the Florida.

549
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,880
So either they've got to put fluids in
there just from we're taking showers,

550
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:58,090
you know me,
I'm obsessed with showers and I got

551
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,700
plenty of plugs in my ears when I go in
the shower and I go in there for an hour

552
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,700
when you know,
when California had the drought,

553
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,560
I go to Vegas,
I got one of those king size pin shouts.

554
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,870
I smoked a joint going there for an hour
and a half.

555
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:10,340
I read jokes.
Oh yeah.

556
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:13,710
I love taking long showers,
shower material.

557
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,410
Really your best material level,
you can even practice it in that

558
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,510
fluid stuck in my ear.

559
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,100
And last week I went to acupuncture and
she stuck a needle in there and when she

560
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:30,020
took it out,
it relieved the pressure.

561
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,860
Joe,
I could feel the blood dripping down my

562
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:37,580
face and I could hear it hitting the
pillow and I didn't pass out.

563
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,530
Oh,
I want to get these fears a little way

564
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:45,500
back to tactical fitness.
The rings,

565
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:49,940
he has rings and Alberto taught me
emotion that it's all about my

566
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:52,550
breathing.
I don't leave my ass on the floor.

567
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,900
So I basically pick up my hips as a hip
escape and in the same.

568
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,240
Then I hold that breath,
but I pulled myself up.

569
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:04,510
I stay there and then I as I leave my
hips back is when I exhale and then my

570
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,050
arms go down on that one.
So it's a two point breathing thing,

571
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,330
dog.
I do three sets of 10 of those.

572
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:12,980
I'm on fire after that.
Yeah.

573
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:14,570
I'm a big believer in that.
Fire

574
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,080
breathing is gigantic.
It's another thing that seems so simple,

575
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,490
right?
It's another thing you tell people,

576
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:20,930
oh,
you got to do some breathing exercises.

577
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,840
People that I'm not doing that shit.
I'm doing bench and bro going to build

578
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,760
up my pecs,
bro.

579
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,050
Right?
That's what people do.

580
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:28,520
They don't.
They don't think that breathing is

581
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,640
difficult,
but breathing exercises I.

582
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,260
This is what I tell people.
Breathe in for one minute and breathe

583
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:35,510
out for one minute.
Tell me that's not hard.

584
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,490
Just take a one minute breath in,
look at a clock and say ready,

585
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:44,160
go.
And then breathe in for one solid

586
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,260
minute,
nice and slow,

587
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,290
and then breathe out for one minute.
Nice and slow.

588
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,510
You'll be fucking dead.
You're not going to be able to do it.

589
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,290
Most people can hold their breath for a
minute.

590
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,190
If you tell them to breathe in for one
solid minute,

591
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,470
it's really hard to do,
but then you go to like a yoga class and

592
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:01,380
you take,
you know,

593
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:02,400
Yoga,
deep breathing,

594
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,970
Pranayama exercises.
They're very difficult and one of the

595
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,800
things that I.
When I first started doing yoga,

596
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,440
like about two years ago,
I really started getting into it again.

597
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,743
The,
the,

598
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,310
the breathing exercises after class when
you like,

599
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,100
when you're doing those breathing
exercises.

600
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,350
It was like my stomach felt soft.
It felt like it was kind of weak.

601
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,310
Like you would get tired doing those.
I'm like,

602
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,360
why is my.
And I was like,

603
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:25,530
I'm just tired from Yoga.

604
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,470
Like why is my stomach getting tired
from breathing out?

605
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:30,450
Like pushing air out.
It's so simple.

606
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:33,990
Like I do sit ups and leg lifts and all
this different stuff.

607
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:36,900
Like why is that difficult?
Because it's a different kind of thing

608
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,330
and you're breathing,
you're pushing air out with your

609
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:44,120
diaphragm and your abdominal muscles.
But now I could do it pretty good and,

610
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,020
but you get to like that Hicks and
Gracie Point,

611
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:50,430
I'm sure you've seen that pull in the
muscles up in these weird ways and make

612
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:54,240
them dance and it's so connected.
Brain brain is connected to your

613
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:56,570
breeding,
the heart granted to your breathing and

614
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,780
understanding what's important to regain
access to proper breathing.

615
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah.
Even for people to think,

616
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,590
okay,
breeding for meditation.

617
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,160
No into the olive.
No pre written is good for everything.

618
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,280
He's visualizing what she needed to do
it.

619
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,660
They know reset.

620
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,200
You can switch from your pressing.
But that the theory of the sympathetic

621
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:18,470
and parasympathetic.
Yeah,

622
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,241
never sees him.
You know,

623
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:23,220
it's like you breathe correctly,
especially on the stress and the you

624
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:25,350
need to regain access to your community
president.

625
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:29,430
Especially if you need to do something
that is more complex and you think about

626
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,350
it.
Some people that just thinking,

627
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:31,870
okay,
under,

628
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,130
under the gas response,
you know when my,

629
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,830
my father Fraser fight or flight and the
tuition is on.

630
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,660
Okay.
I probably go to my gross motor skills.

631
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,600
Yeah.
But some people like an advanced fight

632
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:50,070
that on a an operator,
they need to go to access to gross motor

633
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:51,830
skills and fine motor skills.
Think about,

634
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,780
I'm going to run across this room.
I need to use my gross motor,

635
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:57,450
skipped over on foster,
but I need to understand what am I going

636
00:28:57,451 --> 00:29:00,240
to find covert and maybe shooting back
to a target.

637
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,210
So now you have final the skates on and
gross motor skills.

638
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,550
Any to be able to get my product
vertical view because I can't explain my

639
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,990
tuna.
So hold on.

640
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:12,890
Let's let your English was tripping.
That's okay.

641
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,090
I see.
What you're talking about is a big motor

642
00:29:15,091 --> 00:29:20,000
skills like running and sprinting and
then being able to shoot a gun up and be

643
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,300
very precise and very accurate,
which is an the outfit interpret that

644
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,380
enables the people shooting at me from
so complex.

645
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,230
Complex.
So do you have guys do that?

646
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:34,130
Do you have guys like lift weights and
then go or do licks,

647
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,080
strenuous physical exercises then go
immediately to a range or honoring?

648
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,480
We do that,
but also,

649
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:41,950
you know,
when we will start with what is the

650
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:42,430
importance

651
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,180
of,
um,

652
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,860
learning how to recover fast to using
the breathing recovery Britain,

653
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,400
like the tactical breathing in some feel
like you were talking about some they

654
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,540
never see,
they used to do a lot for me and it's a

655
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,230
44 seconds in,
four seconds,

656
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,660
four seconds on a very basic way to
learn how to get back from the

657
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:06,870
intensities to above your Ra Max tool,
let's say 85 percent something that you

658
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:10,000
can bring you back to a cognitive
presence so you can make the right

659
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:12,370
decision.
So that's what you tell people to do.

660
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:14,200
Take a four second end and for second
out.

661
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:16,540
So you're like slow controlling of the
breathing.

662
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,230
That's the beginning of understanding
because we're going to be,

663
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,400
when it would be going to start going
into my nose and maybe taking a post,

664
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,060
go out to my mind.
So the,

665
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:30,820
my iris would be in through the nose,
out through the mouth.

666
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,800
Yeah.
That does seem to somehow or another

667
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,200
slow down your heart rate for some
reason.

668
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,320
Exactly.
And that's your slow down.

669
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,920
He's going to give you a senior back to
your brain.

670
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,440
Okay.
Now we switched our finances under

671
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:43,660
control so you can make the right
decision.

672
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,690
You can get back to the the final
discussion that if it's needed right

673
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,260
then that obviously with when you're
training soldiers,

674
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:53,140
it's got to be one of the most important
things to do to be able to operate under

675
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:55,990
pressure and under physical pressure and
make the right choice.

676
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,670
Yes,
that's different.

677
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:59,260
You know,
they're not panicking.

678
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,600
The survival response would tell you do
the things that maybe it's more logical

679
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:07,180
to save your life,
but sometimes like I always use this

680
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:08,740
example,
we're going to cross the street right

681
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,220
now.
You're going to cross,

682
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:11,360
you see the car,
you're going to freeze,

683
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,810
and then you're deciding,
jump back or jump forward,

684
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:15,550
whatever is your response to see.

685
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,070
Don't get hit by the car.
Right?

686
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:23,550
But it may take like 12 milliseconds in.
If you've been training more to that

687
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,210
kind of alarm,
you're going to see the car and you want

688
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:32,110
to do before you jump in and out.
You're going to look and see on the

689
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,740
other side because maybe you see the
car,

690
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,470
you jump back,
you didn't see the car coming from

691
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,730
another part and you get killed for the
Ellicott that take our response of 300

692
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,750
millisecond,
so it's the Amiga will tell you to do

693
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:48,160
whatever is needed to get out from the
problem faster,

694
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,370
but the long way of your brain response,
if you've been training,

695
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,560
you become resilient to the alarm and
shock situation.

696
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,130
You're going to make the right choice
and for an operator,

697
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:02,860
for a fight or whatever,
it's a logical thing about Jujitsu,

698
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:04,360
a chess game,
chess game,

699
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,310
even those guys to play chess.

700
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,840
So under stress,
our brain is cooking and the guys make a

701
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:13,930
move and maybe me,
but they're not playing and just,

702
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,830
you know,
I see the move.

703
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:17,710
I see I got moved this way.
The other guy's planning with taking

704
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:21,340
more time to plan whatever is going on
because you start to understand why you

705
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,410
did that move.
So it's not a logical for me,

706
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:27,220
I shouldn't be going that way.
And in training regarding access to your

707
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:28,270
breath,
into your right,

708
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,790
to your brain,
control is fundamental.

709
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,800
That's why I believe we need to be
careful and understand fitness is so

710
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:37,270
important.
We can do a lot of things.

711
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,620
It's not just changing our other way.
They look.

712
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,080
We can add different people in different
things.

713
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,460
For some people it's life changing.
You had the ability to be calm under

714
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,090
pressure is something that very few
people have and they just don't.

715
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,430
They don't.
It's not something that they exercise.

716
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,290
They don't get to do it on a regular
basis.

717
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:58,040
They don't get severely stressed so that
when they are in a severe stress

718
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:01,280
situation and they have to make a
critical decision or they have to use

719
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:03,500
fine motor skills in a critical
situation,

720
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:06,440
most people are just completely
incapable of handling that.

721
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,580
That'll emotional and physiological load
or what is it about.

722
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,460
There's something interesting about
breathing in through your mouth that

723
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:16,730
creates like a panic feeling.
Like when guys are tired.

724
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,723
Yeah.
Like what is.

725
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,390
I don't understand.
Like it's a shallow breathing thing that

726
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:21,170
happens.
Yeah.

727
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,040
They took too much air in.
I believe that's what it is in the

728
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,090
brace,
the province,

729
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,430
they bring clamp up called the,
we call it like a,

730
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,060
like a fourth leg to into the fear
reaction and so for your brain,

731
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,590
while you bracing,
bracing where you don't know,

732
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,190
something you never expecting.

733
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,090
So for my brain,
my data bases say he's been there before

734
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,700
in your life,
you'd be freezing for something and they

735
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:47,630
will bring you back.
Okay,

736
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,160
this is a fierce situation,
so your sympathetic system is on and you

737
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:54,830
start to lose control.
Hit that panic mode.

738
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:58,140
I think it's so simple.
You know how many time you let you touch

739
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,930
your when when you're under stress or
under the assumption you know you'll be

740
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,180
losing control of your.
Maybe you.

741
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,920
We fight.
We have a discussion,

742
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:09,560
very intensive discussion and you can
touch your lace.

743
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,680
So
breathing in.

744
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,560
One of the things that you really
learned that during yoga class in

745
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,200
various particularly stressful
situations,

746
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,960
it's so hard to breathe smooth.
It's one of the.

747
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,200
One of the things that I've learned how
to do is to try to concentrate only on

748
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:30,080
my breath and it actually makes the
exercise easier,

749
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,110
which doesn't seem to make any sense
because before I would just be

750
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:36,650
concentrating on the exercise and what I
realized somewhere along the line is my

751
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,710
breath is not very smooth and I'm not
doing a good job of controlling myself.

752
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,280
So now when I'm in a situation like a
really difficult like standing bow pose

753
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:48,650
or something like that,
what I concentrated on more than

754
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:53,000
anything more even than the posture is
just my breathing concentrate on big,

755
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:55,220
slow,
deep breaths and I swear it makes it

756
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:58,550
like 10 percent easier.
Just concentrating on the breathing

757
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,550
makes everything easier.
And Chrome Gracie said that too.

758
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:04,370
When he was in here.
We were talking about Jujitsu and he's

759
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:05,300
like,
it's breath.

760
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,510
Breath is everything.
And once you can control your breath,

761
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:10,400
when you understand how to control your
breath,

762
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,100
it makes those positions better,
makes Jujitsu easier.

763
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:18,710
It makes everything better.
So your breath control your breath,

764
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,010
Jolie,
and you say that,

765
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,220
I think you know what?
I allowed all of us.

766
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:27,200
We know how to brace.
Are we talking for half an hour?

767
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,810
We never stop it and do it while we're
talking,

768
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:34,220
but we're not under stress to do the
problem is what people.

769
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,010
They don't know how to excel.
If you take amend and put it under the

770
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,520
water with the head,
right,

771
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,610
what is the last things is going to do
before you die?

772
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,190
When it gets to breathing,
so the body.

773
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,000
Exactly know when it's time to inhale.
It doesn't know how to.

774
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,360
When it's time to exhale.
That's fear.

775
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,460
That's where we didn't have to force
people.

776
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:55,590
Hyperventilate.
Like my six year old gets upset about

777
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:57,900
things.
Sometimes she hyperventilates like she

778
00:35:57,901 --> 00:35:59,790
just can't get it out.
Like she's upset.

779
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,270
Like someone did this to me,
you know,

780
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:04,081
and you've got to go,
okay,

781
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,480
you got to calm down.
I want you to take some big deep

782
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:08,670
breaths,
but it's hard to teach a six year old

783
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,240
doesn't know what the fuck do we do on
stage for breathing?

784
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Just talk about.
I never thought about it like I started

785
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:21,840
getting anxiety at the store.
So now when I walk up to the original

786
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:24,300
room,
like on Tuesdays or when I did the

787
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:27,420
wheelchair and I forced myself to
breathe in and out of my nose,

788
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,060
but for years we're excited at the
store.

789
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,610
Yeah.
And the original launch I've been back.

790
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,710
I don't know.
It all started.

791
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,580
I had a follow Morgan Murphy.
I don't know.

792
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:41,550
I went up there,
she was on stage and I don't know what

793
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:43,800
it is.
I just get anxiety and the original room

794
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,150
just a little bit,
just a little bit.

795
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:51,270
And at the wiltern theater I walked out
and I looked that way and then I looked

796
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:55,080
at the audience and it was like woo.
And I had to breathe through my nose,

797
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:59,260
but what did we do on stage?
Are we breathing through our nose or are

798
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:04,261
we breathing through our mouth?
We fucking talk shit for 45,

799
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,080
one hour.
I looked at the special shot.

800
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,510
I'm like,
where am I breathing?

801
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,890
Yeah.
How interesting that we got to watch

802
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:16,360
that next time.
What the fuck are we doing up there?

803
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,480
Yeah.
You're not thinking.

804
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,430
You're just breathing.
Yeah.

805
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:23,340
Will you just concentrated so much on
what you're trying to say that it all

806
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,650
just comes natural.
Just like right now while I'm talking to

807
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:27,020
you right now.
I like.

808
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:29,040
I took a little breath right there,
but I wasn't thinking about it.

809
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,170
I just don't want any.
I want to get a little bit of air.

810
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,690
Right,
right,

811
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,890
right.
Because it's so natural for you.

812
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:38,250
Maybe take me on a conference the first
time and wasn't going to be shaking and

813
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:43,251
go around into my ward and then you see
that from people that are given speeches

814
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,870
and you do see that when they've not
become comfortable with public speaking.

815
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,420
Public speaking is one of the most
stressful things for people.

816
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,650
For some people like number two or
number one in some people's world,

817
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,390
like it's really bad.
I had one.

818
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,410
One time a judge asked me,
he was about to sentence me and he goes,

819
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:05,250
do you ever say these for yourself?
And I had it written down.

820
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,600
I had everything.
Joe Rogan.

821
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,250
I started tweaking.
He was like,

822
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,173
don't worry about it.

823
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,080
Pan.
I couldn't talk.

824
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,400
I went right into a panic when this
little man looked at me,

825
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,370
but people get nervous,
you know,

826
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,320
and when you get nervous your adrenaline
kicks in and when your adrenaline kicks

827
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:26,630
in,
everything tightens it,

828
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,010
you know,
just you know,

829
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:33,090
and physiological stress like yoga
positions can kind of mimic that.

830
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,980
Like when you were in a position like
when you got your hands over

831
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,170
your head and you're leaning your whole
body to the side,

832
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,220
it's very hard to stay smooth with your
breathing when you're in those spots.

833
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:45,340
Like that's the number one thing that I
concentrate on holding my body in that

834
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:49,510
position is not nearly as hard as
holding my body and breathing smoothly.

835
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,930
Breathing smoothly is the most difficult
part of that posture,

836
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:53,943
like a lot of pasta,

837
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,760
and as soon as it's changed your
breathing,

838
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,630
you started to changing inside and then
you change it outside.

839
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,840
I see.
I see that happening.

840
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,190
A lot of you know I love was the first
reaction when you're under stress,

841
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,710
tension,
tension,

842
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:10,470
but for four,
if you look back there or what happened

843
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:14,580
when you were in the pre storia phrase,
three prehistory,

844
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,880
greatest thing about it,
that you are a prey.

845
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,720
What you're doing.
Yeah,

846
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,070
like any animal,
like a cat in the road and the road they

847
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:23,750
start to pump.
This is hair hot,

848
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,930
become bigger.
Right?

849
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,920
So that's what we doing.
We growing our shapes so the product

850
00:39:28,921 --> 00:39:30,330
might look at as like,
oh,

851
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:33,060
we're too big.
I'm going to attack a simple,

852
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,130
simple prayer.
We try to,

853
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:36,370
you know,
our,

854
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:40,370
our skin start to trickle in Sanford,
like nice pumps.

855
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:40,891
We,
yeah,

856
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:42,930
we don't have hair,
but we start to do the same.

857
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:44,760
Maybe the same example.
Goosebumps are.

858
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,110
It's like your hair's figure.

859
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:53,160
That's interesting and if I look in how
come it's like that when you hear a good

860
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:58,161
song that's a different feeling.
It's like a lot of people,

861
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:00,960
they misinterpret it or the old thinking
that we thought,

862
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:02,570
okay,
we go tactical training,

863
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:07,290
we do this and we can control a fear
reaction to different things.

864
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:12,291
You can control when you are really
under stress for the kind of situation,

865
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:15,690
so our rate for years and other things,
matter of fact,

866
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,740
I I intensity workout.
You become erad under fear.

867
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:21,390
You become important,
so it's different.

868
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:24,450
Different physiological things going
into your into your body,

869
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:26,160
so they all things that people didn't
want.

870
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:31,310
Any misunderstanding that doing some
kind of a high intensity workout we can

871
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:35,130
control also the fear,
real fear because real fears and other

872
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:35,964
things.

873
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,660
Well,
one of the things you see with fighters

874
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,940
is they perform better when they're more
active,

875
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,670
when they fight more often.
So if the fighter fights like three

876
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:45,130
times a year,
they're used to fighting every few

877
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,790
months and they get that feeling of
competition becomes a normal natural

878
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:51,430
thing for them.
And it's also something that happens

879
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:54,310
when you see a fight or lose.
When you see a fighter losing and they

880
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:56,560
come back,
they were very tense and they fight.

881
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,560
A lot of times they fight different
because they're.

882
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:04,540
They're now worried and concerned about
the consequences of failure and you see

883
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,400
that that fear,
that tension,

884
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,550
it's in their system and then they their
whole,

885
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,940
their whole mode of operating as a.
As a,

886
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:15,640
as an athlete changes because of that
tension.

887
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,130
There's the dinner to Cobra for the
shot,

888
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,970
for this situation they'd been through.
Sure,

889
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:19,840
and that's all.

890
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,530
Also one of the biggest factors when you
talk about the difference between the

891
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:27,880
way someone performs in the gym versus
the way someone performs in competition.

892
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,930
We've all known these guys that were
phenomenal in the gym,

893
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,630
but for whatever reason they weren't
able to win in competition.

894
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,550
It's so common.
It's with some guys.

895
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:41,360
It's almost like like it's crazy.
It's almost like there's a spell on them

896
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:43,330
or something like you'll see them in the
Jimmy,

897
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,570
like this guy is a world beater,
but they can't beat anybody in a.

898
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,370
In a competition.
It is psychological.

899
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:53,060
It's all psychological.
There they are imprisoned by their own

900
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:56,780
fears and doubts.
They don't have the confidence to rise

901
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,370
to the occasion.
They don't have the confidence to

902
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,800
perform under pressure.
They don't have the.

903
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,340
They can't just accept the potential
failure.

904
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,600
They can't.
They're so overwhelmed and imprisoned by

905
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:10,910
their fear of failure that when they get
out there,

906
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:12,530
they can't perform at their best.

907
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,310
It's crazy because it forces failure.
It's like a self fulfilling prophecy

908
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,920
because they can't perform like they do
in the gym.

909
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,870
They can't just react.
They can't flow.

910
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,470
Like when you were fighting,
when you're at your best,

911
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,100
you're sort of just in this empty space
like you're not.

912
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,670
You're not thinking about the moves as
much as they're just happening and

913
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:35,680
you're just relying on your training and
you're almost the best thing you do is

914
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,970
stay calm because as soon as you get
emotional,

915
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,670
as soon as you get aggressive,
you might win being emotional

916
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,170
aggressive.
You could catch someone and knock them

917
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:43,850
out,
but you also might get knocked out

918
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:46,640
yourself.
You might do something that's not smart

919
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,910
like when you're talking earlier about
playing chess.

920
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Martial arts is a lot of ways,
like very much like chess,

921
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:57,110
but way more complicated because your
physical consequences are so severe,

922
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,840
so there's all this fear.
It's not just about losing.

923
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,750
It's about getting hit and that
punishment of physical consequences is

924
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,040
so significant.
It's so much different even than in

925
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,330
Jujitsu.
Jujitsu,

926
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,480
the physical consequences are tapping
and losing and those are terrible,

927
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,050
but it's nothing like getting kicked in
the face or getting one of those Yoel

928
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,150
Romero flying knees to your head.
You know,

929
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:21,980
that kind of fear is,
that's an overwhelming fear and for some

930
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:26,150
people they get a throw up when they're
in the locker room and they did panic

931
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,580
me,
they get so scared they just can't

932
00:43:28,581 --> 00:43:29,660
perform under pressure.

933
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,040
You know,
you know,

934
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,770
if you could trust for this.
Also through some of the operator,

935
00:43:34,771 --> 00:43:35,420
you know,
the,

936
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,420
some of the operator that literally
dump and when you say an operator,

937
00:43:41,071 --> 00:43:46,071
you're talking about special ops guys
that the tough and didn't a super guys

938
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,530
know.
I'm amazed by those guys.

939
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,530
They just chapeau but there's naturally,
oh,

940
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,230
they don't do it in the task.
It might.

941
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,020
I might be shitting in my pants,
you know,

942
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:00,860
it's not physiological,
physiological and then you keep going,

943
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,410
just keep going with shit.
And that's the physiological reaction to

944
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:07,290
the stress factor.
Your body wants to get lighter,

945
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,510
to fight back faster or run away or
whatever.

946
00:44:09,511 --> 00:44:10,670
You can control,
you know,

947
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,290
there's nothing to be ashamed about it.
You see it with animals as well.

948
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:15,120
I mean,
there's a famous video these two bears

949
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:17,060
fighting and as the bears are fighting,
they're,

950
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,920
they're shitting all over the place as
they're fighting,

951
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,660
they're shitting.
I,

952
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:22,300
uh,
I,

953
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,040
I love watching movies like collateral
or something.

954
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:30,780
When people go into some place and they
shoot the place up and people's reaction

955
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:31,933
are they run.

956
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,600
That's not usually the case,
bro.

957
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,630
I've seen it.
People dropped on the fucking floor.

958
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,970
People dropped without even getting
shot.

959
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,590
They don't know what.
You just freeze the sound of you being

960
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:47,430
somewhere and being transferred to the
sounds of gunfire.

961
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,660
It's fucking overwhelming.
And some people get it and react to it.

962
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,850
And some people just think it's the
fourth of July.

963
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:54,810
Yeah.
You know,

964
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,430
it's really weird.
But I've seen people fucking dropped

965
00:44:58,431 --> 00:45:02,280
from fear dropped from fear,
something that I was as a child when I

966
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:05,490
was two blocks away from just people
dropping from fear,

967
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,310
you know,
it's so like I remember when I lived in

968
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:11,580
Aspen,
they have the Esi body guard academy and

969
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:15,740
aspect.
What does that stand for?

970
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,950
I don't know.
But the guy supposedly was in a room six

971
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:23,910
by 12 room where they killed 12 Mexicans
at knife point with his bands.

972
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:28,320
So he opens up this Esi thing and it's,
you know,

973
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:29,820
it's 20 g's,
you know,

974
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:32,820
it's,
it's a summer long program and you learn

975
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:37,821
how to adjust up or die out the tube and
drive and evasive driving and shooting.

976
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,090
Then they have a course on maritime,
how to defend people out on the ocean

977
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,430
and all that stuff.
But uh,

978
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:48,150
she asked for it and all that,
those places like woody creek where you

979
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:53,151
went to his home,
to the baddest retired soldiers in the

980
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:57,810
world and you don't know who they are.
You just think that dude over there with

981
00:45:57,811 --> 00:46:00,720
the American flag is mowing the lawn
that I killed.

982
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:02,640
80 people want to end them.
Bad Guy.

983
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,640
There's a guy endeavor that I know,
I'm telling you,

984
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,260
Colorado is where they put them.
Why,

985
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,840
why they put them in because the
mountains to keep them away from

986
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:13,720
civilization for these people just in
case they get Chinese music somewhere.

987
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,940
They don't ever want that to happen.
Break glass in case of war.

988
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,240
And there was a guy that came in that
was a marine that bro Joe,

989
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,190
you know,
anybody comes in with stories.

990
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:25,620
I know one thing when I see it,
I believe it.

991
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,860
The motherfucker used to get picked up
at Aspen and put him in the helicopter

992
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,230
though.
Like they sent like a helicopter with

993
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:35,610
two guys jumping out for guys around
them and he was just waiting.

994
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:39,330
But uncle Joey,
I was 19 and he would tell me stories

995
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:40,260
about,
you know,

996
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:45,490
the green berets and all these guys were
sitting around a thing cooking chili and

997
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:50,150
they will all tell telling how many
people they killed killed 18.

998
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,970
I killed 22.
Meanwhile he was stirring the soup with

999
00:46:53,971 --> 00:46:56,670
this big over the fire.
You know what I'm saying?

1000
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:59,340
Like that's,
that's the type of stories this guy

1001
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:00,090
would tell me.

1002
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,780
He had me all fucked up in the head and
I asked him once I go,

1003
00:47:03,781 --> 00:47:05,940
should I go to that Esi?
And he goes,

1004
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:08,880
listen,
I go in there and smack them all with my

1005
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:10,020
left hand.
If he goes,

1006
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,830
first of all,
you can't teach what you need to learn

1007
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:18,831
over there because four years of Charlie
and the Bush is a lot better than 12

1008
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:23,040
weeks of you hanging out with some white
dudes with suits,

1009
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,550
shooting people targets and it's not
real.

1010
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:27,480
It's not until there's real
consequences.

1011
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,100
So that's why he said it just wasn't.
Don't you think

1012
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,290
though it's better than nothing?
I would think that it's better than

1013
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,960
nothing.
I would think that the best thing would

1014
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:39,250
be actually being in bootcamp,
actually going to bud's actually being

1015
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:42,010
in some sort of a situation.
We realized this is life,

1016
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,460
this is real.
Whereas if you're,

1017
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:48,400
if you're preparing like up in Colorado
and you just go through that course,

1018
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,030
you might have some things in your mind,
but that's one of the things like people

1019
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:53,770
say to me like,
like,

1020
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:57,160
should I take a self defense class?
Like when they show you how to kick

1021
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:58,030
somebody in the name,
I go,

1022
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:01,510
listen to me.
That shit is not going to like,

1023
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,820
there was,
there was a guy on the fucking radio

1024
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,770
that was,
he was always talking about,

1025
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:06,604
uh,
um,

1026
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:10,260
it was on opiod anthony show back in the
day and he was always talking about this

1027
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:14,080
difference between the street and a
martial arts and martial arts

1028
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:14,680
tournaments.

1029
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,590
There's no rules in the street.
There's no rules.

1030
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,070
And I'm like,
I fucking hate when people say that kind

1031
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:23,770
of Shit because listen to me,
the stuff that works on trained killers

1032
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,130
is the real shit.
And if you think that you're going to

1033
00:48:26,131 --> 00:48:28,180
come in and you're going to throw some
fucking karate,

1034
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:31,120
chop someone's balls and you're going to
somehow or another be able to stop

1035
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:33,280
Anderson Silva from kicking you across
the room.

1036
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,980
You're out of your fucking mind,
you're out of your mind.

1037
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,641
You,
first of all,

1038
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:38,140
you're not going to karate chop his
balls.

1039
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:39,820
He's not going to let you get close
enough to him,

1040
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,560
and if he does let you get close enough
to him,

1041
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,630
he's going to strangle you and you're
not gonna.

1042
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:45,970
Be able to do a goddamn thing about it.
You're going to be a 100 percent

1043
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:46,990
helpless.
So this,

1044
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,070
these ideas that there's a shortcut and
the shortcut is like street defense.

1045
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,860
There's a certain pressure points around
your neck.

1046
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:56,260
I could attack that and you will be
helpless.

1047
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:56,770
No,
no,

1048
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,000
no.
You're not going to get my neck.

1049
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,410
You father,
let me grab your finger.

1050
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:00,943
Uh,
yeah.

1051
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,570
There was a guy at the store he used to
pinch down on literally the,

1052
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,960
this is the biggest phony I've ever met
in all my years of meeting phony martial

1053
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:14,170
arts guys.
He used to pinch down on your thumbnail.

1054
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,000
He was like,
there's a pressure point and your thumb,

1055
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,800
like motherfucker do lie on me with
their knee on my neck.

1056
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,380
Like they'll put all their weight on
your neck to try to get you to give up

1057
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:25,450
the arm bar.
Like if you're in a situation where

1058
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:27,490
you're defending,
it's an art bar and the guy's on top,

1059
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:31,420
you guys will put their fucking knee a
tour and 30 pound man will put his knee

1060
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:35,170
on your neck while he's trying to and
it'll put all his weight on it and

1061
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:36,760
you're not.
You're not tapping from that.

1062
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:38,530
You think I'm going to tap from a
thumbnail.

1063
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,301
It's funny.
I.

1064
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:44,380
So people try to get into the,
especially for community and try to

1065
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:48,550
teach them pressure points.
Do you realize this guy's wedding,

1066
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,950
waterproof jacket?
The material,

1067
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,070
you're not going to even access to the
body.

1068
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:59,500
It's crazy.
There's so many stupid martial arts

1069
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:02,200
courses and it's so.
It's so fucking dumb.

1070
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,170
It's so dumb.
There's so many,

1071
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:08,680
these ridiculous ideas that you're going
to be able to defend yourself with some

1072
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:10,270
tricks.
But you know,

1073
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,790
you were saying the cod people,
people that love these things,

1074
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:14,140
you know,
like shit,

1075
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,940
I have six bucks.
Yeah,

1076
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:18,510
I mean there's training day in six weeks
or whatever.

1077
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,600
Late night infomercials that you only
have 15 minutes,

1078
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:25,870
but 15 minutes is two minutes too much.
Thirteen minutes.

1079
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:27,650
It's all you need.
Thirteen minutes.

1080
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,870
All you need is 13 minutes and you're
like,

1081
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,880
wow.
That's what I've been waiting for.

1082
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:32,930
I want to be shredded.

1083
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,213
Great.
In the beach.

1084
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,560
Thirteen minutes.
Fuck the fuck Outta here.

1085
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:40,900
You've had a civilization of just these
big thick pills,

1086
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:44,070
which are just things that a quick
fixes.

1087
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,980
You know,
if you stay up past one,

1088
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,410
it's,
it's all attacking men.

1089
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,350
Testosterone level.
I don't know what it is about people

1090
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:53,300
after one.
I'm fucking tired.

1091
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,500
We're all tired.
Yeah.

1092
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:55,610
So with sleeping.
Yeah,

1093
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:56,930
but those guys that are up late at
night,

1094
00:50:56,931 --> 00:51:01,700
they just look like half a half.
Add resistance is down.

1095
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,210
Do you have more sex drive?
I mean they just sell you some fucking

1096
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:08,280
bill of lading,
whether it's the big dick pills or the

1097
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:13,010
six minute workout and then they keep
beating each other like by one minute we

1098
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:15,830
have the sick,
but we have the five minute workout and

1099
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:18,410
you know what man?
Half of America buys into that.

1100
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,930
A lot of America buys into the sap
pills.

1101
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,850
That's the sad thing.
And once again,

1102
00:51:22,851 --> 00:51:24,500
if you want me to go back to what we
discussed before,

1103
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,940
it's not about us.
So you know,

1104
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,550
you're breathing out,
comfortable.

1105
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,970
You on the situation.
I always give because I believe I've

1106
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:33,200
been there.
I don't know you guys,

1107
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:37,460
but sometime you want,
you desire to date someone so badly and

1108
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,330
you get so excited when you get it and
the first day that you go,

1109
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,110
you feel like you cannot even move,
you know,

1110
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,010
panic.
And if you remember that day,

1111
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,080
it doesn't work the way that you want
to.

1112
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:48,741
You,
you pray,

1113
00:51:48,741 --> 00:51:52,190
they go to work,
but after you pass the first shot.

1114
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,140
But the second,
the third is become better.

1115
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,420
It's exercising and breathing control.
These are the same,

1116
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:57,950
you know,
once you get used to,

1117
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,020
everything's comfortable.
It's just,

1118
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:02,300
that's a big thing with again,
what we were talking about with

1119
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:03,020
fighting.

1120
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:03,950
When I,
when I,

1121
00:52:03,951 --> 00:52:05,810
um,
I had one time where I tore a muscle.

1122
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,380
I didn't compete for like six months.
It was like the longest time I'd ever

1123
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:13,820
gone without competing because I tore
the muscle that connects the groin to

1124
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:14,654
like,
um,

1125
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,690
I think it's called a Satorius muscle.
It's like at the top of the leg.

1126
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:19,490
It was real bad.
I couldn't throw any kicks at all.

1127
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,950
I can only do my workouts in the pool
was pretty bad.

1128
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,450
And so when I was recovering from that,
when I got back in the,

1129
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,850
my first fight back,
I was like,

1130
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:30,950
wow,
it just feels so off.

1131
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:33,230
My timing feels off.
Everything feels weird.

1132
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:38,060
But then I fought again less than a
month later and I felt great like less

1133
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:39,320
than a month later.
Everything was like,

1134
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:40,370
all right,
I know this again,

1135
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,570
this is,
this is my thing.

1136
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:42,470
I've been here before.

1137
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,110
And then it felt normal again.
It's like when you were,

1138
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,410
when you have a girlfriend,
if you have a girlfriend for a long

1139
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:50,030
time,
you don't get nervous about whether or

1140
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:51,830
not you're going to get it up.
You don't panic.

1141
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:53,990
Like we hope she looked at me.
She fucking likes you.

1142
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:55,740
She's naked,
she's right there.

1143
00:52:55,741 --> 00:52:57,310
She's been with you forever.
You know,

1144
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,210
she likes you so it's not,
it's not an issue,

1145
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,830
but if you know,
if it is,

1146
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:02,450
like you said,
a curl that you've been thinking about

1147
00:53:02,451 --> 00:53:05,810
for the longest time and you're only
going to grow and I hope those schools

1148
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:10,811
will whoop and then you finally get
weather like this panic and the,

1149
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:15,860
the human penis is such a fucking odd
thing in that regard.

1150
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,870
You know,
that's what a bizarre thing.

1151
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:20,330
It's designed to make sure like,
look dude,

1152
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:22,430
if you ain't come,
you're not going to fuck.

1153
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:25,890
Okay.
Because we don't want any weak ass

1154
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,400
nervous

1155
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,510
bitches out there make it babies.
So the system is built to make sure that

1156
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:33,210
you're an addict is not get hard if you
fucking panicking.

1157
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:37,110
It's not like,
it's not like a Rhino Horn were armed

1158
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:38,510
and ready at all times.
No,

1159
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:42,330
it's not like a very specific
physiological process has to be in place

1160
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:45,450
with the softest part of your body
becomes hard,

1161
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:49,320
like a fucking rock like that.
The process itself is crazy.

1162
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,160
When you look at your Dick,
when you go into p and it's this soft

1163
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:57,090
little spongy thing,
and then you grab your Dick when it's at

1164
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,540
full mast and it's like,
how is it the same thing?

1165
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:05,750
Because it's this crazy physiological
process that only works if you're ready

1166
00:54:05,881 --> 00:54:06,790
to rock.
Uh,

1167
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,700
you,
you can't be faking it like you,

1168
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:11,010
you,
your body knows if you're panicking,

1169
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:11,983
right?
You,

1170
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,020
it,
there's a book,

1171
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,240
there's a book,
I don't know how you translate it in

1172
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:17,020
English,
but this is a book of this plane.

1173
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,190
So was so simple about those reactions
with the body under stress.

1174
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,320
And he say,
think about the Zebra on the savannah.

1175
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,580
You know,
that's exactly.

1176
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,330
You know,
when you have someone that's choosing

1177
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:30,440
you to hit you and when you are under
stress,

1178
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:33,480
I stress your body stops.
Stop producing hormones like

1179
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:36,600
testosterone.
Why you don't the last thing you want to

1180
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:41,360
have sex and when some lions behind you.
So that's exactly what he's doing is

1181
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:45,900
shutting down whatever is needed,
shutting down everything under stress.

1182
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:47,240
You know,
when you are freaking out,

1183
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,080
you can perform.
We can portfolio.

1184
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:49,900
No,
actually I'll,

1185
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:54,900
confidentially zebras are so bizarre
because the you see the way their body

1186
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:59,961
looks like they're not camouflage at all
like white with black stripes on and for

1187
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:06,180
the longest time they thought that the
white with black stripes on would

1188
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:09,330
confuse and animals mind.
Like there's a type of Cammo.

1189
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,260
Have you ever heard of a sat cammo as a
type of camouflage?

1190
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:16,160
It doesn't look like trees or anything.
It's just a bunch of black and brown

1191
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,700
lines and those lines for animals
because animals there,

1192
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:23,820
their eyes operate on edge detection.
They operate on a lot of them,

1193
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,880
especially prey animals like deer and
things along those lines.

1194
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:27,790
They're,
they,

1195
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,310
they,
they see movement.

1196
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,520
They don't necessarily see things the
way you see things.

1197
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:36,330
They mostly just see movement and so for
the longest time they thought,

1198
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:40,230
well maybe when you're looking like a
lion is looking at a zebra,

1199
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:45,000
the lion is seeing the zebras body and
there's all the lines confused so he

1200
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:47,190
can't see it.
Then they realized,

1201
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,001
no,
no,

1202
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:51,090
no.
What it actually is is you can't pick

1203
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:56,091
out individually zebras.
So like if an individual zebra like it

1204
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:00,930
looks different from the other zebras,
that's the one that they get after,

1205
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,070
like if one's ears bleeding and as blood
on his body and it looks different from

1206
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:06,990
all those other white and black lines.

1207
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,390
That's the one they targeted,
which is kind of fucked.

1208
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:12,570
And one of the ways they found out this,
they tagged a zebra,

1209
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,620
they put like an ear tag on a zebra and
they sent Jordan Peterson was talking

1210
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:18,540
about this recently in this video and
uh,

1211
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,320
they put it back into the herd and the
lines immediately killed at Zebra.

1212
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,730
That's the one they went right to
because it had something different.

1213
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,970
Like did you see all this book?
White and black lines?

1214
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:28,481
And then,
oh,

1215
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:30,490
this motherfucker's got an ear tag,
get them.

1216
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,620
And he just went right after that.
So it's,

1217
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,360
it's really designed like,
look,

1218
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,860
we know we're get,
we're fucked,

1219
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,590
we're born fucked.
But if we stay together,

1220
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,540
you know,
maybe with like look when you see that.

1221
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,950
So when you see all those ears together,
it's super confusing.

1222
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,960
While we will have this fucking TV fixed
soon,

1223
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,310
I swear I'm this,
this,

1224
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,130
this TV cuts in and out that one pack.

1225
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,400
So when you see these zebras and we see
these lines,

1226
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:02,170
what it's designed to do is confuse the
lions so that they don't know which one

1227
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:04,150
to target,
which is crazy,

1228
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,640
but if one of those motherfuckers had an
ear tag,

1229
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:08,560
a big old yellow tag hanging off their
ear,

1230
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,780
the lines would be like,
there you are a bitch.

1231
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,300
I see you.
That's kind of cool.

1232
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,980
It's fun though.
I mean,

1233
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:17,170
what a,
what a terrible situation.

1234
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:21,370
Nature has given these poor things.
The lions are camouflaged.

1235
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,550
The lions look like that.
The brown grasses,

1236
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,340
you know,
and leopard or excuse me,

1237
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:32,341
a tiger's apparently that whole stripe
thing with them is also to make them

1238
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:37,180
blend in with all their surroundings,
all the trees and the sticks.

1239
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:38,710
You know,
they live mostly in the jungle.

1240
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:44,270
So you were asking me before this about
the fights this weekend.

1241
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,760
What do you think would be good context
that occurred?

1242
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,100
That's why they keep.
Well,

1243
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:53,170
they'd know except that it's.
This is what I think a lot of people

1244
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:55,330
were like pissed off.
It was boring,

1245
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,570
but I think that's because they just
want to see people beat the fuck out of

1246
00:57:58,571 --> 00:57:59,800
each other,
which I understand.

1247
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:02,290
That's why you tune into cage fighting.
But to me,

1248
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:07,470
the way I always described martial arts
is it's high level problem solving with

1249
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:11,650
dire physical consequences.
And if you run in on Tyron Woodley,

1250
00:58:11,651 --> 00:58:15,640
you got some dire physical consequences.
He's a fucking powerhouse.

1251
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,800
And if Woodley charges at Thompson,
this dire physical consequences because

1252
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:24,040
he was getting tagged when he would he
need said it to me after the fight.

1253
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:26,050
He's like,
he caught me a few times as I was

1254
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:30,490
charging towards him.
So Woodley has a different style and

1255
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:34,900
Thompson Thompson has that wide stance,
that karate style and he's excellent at

1256
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:37,750
moving in and moving out and almost like
point fighting you.

1257
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:40,210
He just jabbing you,
hitting you with these,

1258
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:41,050
uh,
clean,

1259
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,770
lefthand sliding out of the way.
Occasionally throwing kicks.

1260
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,760
But mostly what he's doing is making you
wonder what he's going to do.

1261
00:58:48,761 --> 00:58:52,150
And when he's coming at you and woody
had to pick his battles and figure out

1262
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:53,580
when he could launch himself,
Adam.

1263
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,950
So at any moment something could have
happened,

1264
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,940
but a lot of shit didn't happen.
So the people watching at home like that

1265
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:04,900
was the most boring fight over.
It's because those moments are so

1266
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,690
critical.
Those moments are so dangerous.

1267
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:11,500
You can't just.
They would like it to be like Frankie

1268
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,970
Edgar Gray Maynard,
just fucking chaos or punches thrown

1269
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,420
wild.
Not going to happen like that.

1270
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,120
You can't do that with wonderboy.
You can't charge at him like that.

1271
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,260
He will fucking counter you and you
look,

1272
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,420
you will be one of those people on his
highlight reel.

1273
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:27,950
So tyron Woodley was very smart and that
he knew that he couldn't charge Adam and

1274
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,100
wonderboy.
He's not going to charge a willy either.

1275
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,050
I mean he got almost knocked the fuck
out.

1276
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:35,280
And the first fight he almost got
knocked the fuck out.

1277
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,800
And in the fifth round of the second
fight to Woodley's a powerhouse man,

1278
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:43,640
he hits so God damn hard.
So everybody had to be on their toes.

1279
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:47,300
They both had to be minding their p's
and q's and that translated for a boring

1280
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:49,730
fight to a lot of people,
but not to me.

1281
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:50,930
To me,
I was like,

1282
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:54,250
anything could happen at any moment in
the fifth round or almost did when,

1283
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,630
when,
when Woodley connected and Thompson's

1284
00:59:56,631 --> 00:59:58,520
knees went out,
I mean he slumped.

1285
00:59:58,521 --> 00:59:59,450
He was out,
man.

1286
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,330
He was out for at least a half,
a second or a moment,

1287
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:05,030
you know,
there was a moment where his legs gave

1288
01:00:05,031 --> 01:00:05,510
out.

1289
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,810
His body went limp and they could've
stopped the fight right there.

1290
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,760
I'm glad they didn't.
Glad they kept going.

1291
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:15,050
I talked to a big John McCarthy in the
cage after the fight ago.

1292
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,420
How close we are to stop with that
fight.

1293
01:00:16,421 --> 01:00:17,660
He goes,
he goes,

1294
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:18,910
I wasn't close to stopping that fight.
I go,

1295
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:19,611
what?
You were looking,

1296
01:00:19,611 --> 01:00:20,240
right?
He goes,

1297
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,620
I was looking go.
You were looking to close.

1298
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,480
He goes,
I'll never admitted it goes,

1299
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:25,370
but it was.
I mean,

1300
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,510
he was almost out right.
He goes,

1301
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:28,430
he was almost out.
It might have been out for half a

1302
01:00:28,431 --> 01:00:29,450
second,
but he,

1303
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:30,460
I gave him a chance.
I go,

1304
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,360
you did a great job.
He did an amazing job.

1305
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,210
I mean that's why big John Mccarthy so
important.

1306
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:38,600
That guy with that kind of experience
and if he fucked that up everybody would

1307
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,530
be so mad at him.

1308
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,900
But he did it perfect.
It was perfect.

1309
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,830
He has the most difficult job in the
sport other than the fighters.

1310
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,490
Fighters have the most difficult job.
Second most difficult job is the

1311
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:51,970
referee.
Third most difficult job is the judges

1312
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,780
really?
So I think so.

1313
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,180
Yeah.
I believe is going to interpret that

1314
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,450
trauma for the other people.
Well he has to be.

1315
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,460
He has to look.
He has to be at the right angle.

1316
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,480
Like they're moving around and they're
fast and they could go to his left and

1317
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:07,460
he can be over here,
but something could be happening.

1318
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:08,241
I'm there.
Right.

1319
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:10,040
And he doesn't even see it.
You know,

1320
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,380
you don't know,
like sometimes sometimes guys don't see

1321
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:15,410
taps.
Sometimes guys don't see a certain I

1322
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:18,470
pokes or groin shots.
There's a lot of things that can happen.

1323
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:23,450
A referee's job is insanely difficult
and they only get praised when they fuck

1324
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:24,210
up.

1325
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:26,060
They only rather get attention when they
fuck up.

1326
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:30,620
They don't get any praise when they do a
great job and just just they need more.

1327
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,550
They need more.
More people need to understand like how

1328
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:38,810
difficult that is,
so that moment where tyron finally did

1329
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:41,090
connect on wonderboy and everybody's
like,

1330
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:43,220
why didn't you do that earlier?
Because you could have got knocked the

1331
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:45,860
fuck out.
Like that was where the opening was.

1332
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:50,360
Woodley was so aggressive because he was
down on the score cards at least in his

1333
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:53,480
corner of his eyes and in my eyes.
He was as well and he had a charge

1334
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:55,790
forward and he had to connect and he
did,

1335
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:00,200
but to make that happen,
a lot of things have to be in place.

1336
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:01,940
You have to understand wonder boys
timing.

1337
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,460
He had been fighting him for four rounds
already.

1338
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,340
He was getting a sense of what wonder
boy could and couldn't do.

1339
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,880
He also knew the consequences.
He'd been tagged a couple of times so he

1340
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:14,540
knew like I can't just rush at them
because wonderboy was trying to tie them

1341
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:16,920
with that right hook.
He was standing on the South Pole

1342
01:02:16,921 --> 01:02:20,010
position with his right leg forward.
He throws that front side kick to the

1343
01:02:20,011 --> 01:02:22,050
body,
throws it really well because he,

1344
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:27,350
he picks it up from the ground like low
and and sort of scoops up so you don't

1345
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:31,260
see it coming until it's too late.
It might not be the most powerful

1346
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:34,020
application of the front leg side kick,
but it's very.

1347
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:38,700
It's very sneaky because he slides in
with that foot low and then it comes up

1348
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:42,180
and stabs you and you don't know if it's
going to come up as a sidekick or if

1349
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:44,550
it's going to go up and over your
shoulders around kick.

1350
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:45,660
You don't know what he's doing.

1351
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:50,460
He's so sneaky.
So tyron had to be very cautious and for

1352
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:52,110
a lot of people it was very boring
because of that,

1353
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,420
but I didn't think it was boring was
happening.

1354
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,670
I was on the edge of my seat.
I was just like,

1355
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:58,650
there are moments.
There's going to be moments when the

1356
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:02,820
shit starts flying and in those moments,
that's where the fight becomes amazing,

1357
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:07,220
but those guys are smart.
They're not dumb in the belt is so God

1358
01:03:07,221 --> 01:03:09,000
damn important.
When you have the belt,

1359
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,640
you get to decide,
you fight all the best fighters,

1360
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,311
you,
you,

1361
01:03:12,311 --> 01:03:13,830
you,
you make the money,

1362
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,870
you know,
you get the opportunities for the big

1363
01:03:15,871 --> 01:03:17,640
money fights,
like the conor mcgregor type fights.

1364
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:20,100
Those only happen if you have the belt.
If you don't have the belt,

1365
01:03:20,101 --> 01:03:23,640
nobody gives a fuck about you.
So for a guy like Tyron,

1366
01:03:23,641 --> 01:03:25,200
man,
that belt is everything.

1367
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,930
For a guy like woody or a guy like a
wonderboy,

1368
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:29,280
rather,
that belt is everything.

1369
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,100
If you don't have that belt,
you make a fraction of what you make.

1370
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,150
Like think about that,
fight that fight.

1371
01:03:34,151 --> 01:03:36,180
It's insanely close.
It was so close.

1372
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:39,420
Dominick Cruz afterwards.
That's basically the same fight as the

1373
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:40,254
first fight,
right?

1374
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,510
It's like you could call if you've
called the first fight of draw,

1375
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:45,550
you could easily call this fight a draw
and I agree with him in.

1376
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:50,690
So that means that wonderboy and Woodley
are essentially like so closely matched

1377
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:53,550
stylistically that it's a wash.
Right?

1378
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,920
But meanwhile,
Woodley's the one who's the champion,

1379
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,540
will,
he's the one who has the potential to

1380
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,460
fight.
Conor McGregor Woodley is the one who

1381
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:02,580
has a potential to fight Michael Bisping
or whoever who else he fights at

1382
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:05,670
whatever he fights at and that is where
the money is.

1383
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,500
So he's the guy who's going to get the
money.

1384
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:12,770
Whereas wonderboy who essentially had a
draw with him prove that he was at least

1385
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:17,580
close enough on one fight and just a
hair under the second fight,

1386
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:18,750
he ma,
he's gonna,

1387
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:23,750
make a fraction of what woodley mix
likely so that those consequences have

1388
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:27,510
to be taken into consideration when
you're watching these guys fight,

1389
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,420
is that they know there's a wind bonus
and there's a loss.

1390
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,910
Like if you,
if you lose,

1391
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,220
you get your show money,
you don't get a bonus,

1392
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:37,410
but if you win,
you get twice the money.

1393
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,170
Like a lot of guys have that way,
their contract is structured,

1394
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,630
you know,
they'll make x if they win and they'll

1395
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:46,470
make x plus x if they'll make x plus x
if they win.

1396
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:47,820
But if they lose,
they only make x.

1397
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,610
So they might have,
they might be getting $200,000 for the

1398
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:52,680
flight,
but another $200,000 if they win,

1399
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,290
that's a giant swing.
That's a big deal.

1400
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,940
So they have to be really fucking
careful.

1401
01:04:56,941 --> 01:05:00,210
They don't make mistakes.
I don't like when bonuses,

1402
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:01,830
man,
I don't like it.

1403
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,990
I think those guys are trying to win
anyway.

1404
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,130
They're trying to win.
I just,

1405
01:05:05,131 --> 01:05:07,920
I just think like especially in
particular in situations like that,

1406
01:05:07,921 --> 01:05:10,080
when fights are like that fucking
clothes,

1407
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,890
like a judge can decide whether or not
you make an extra 200 grand or don't

1408
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,710
like.
That seems crazy to me to do training

1409
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,550
boxing a few a few weeks ago.
Right.

1410
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,940
Back doing Jujitsu again too.
Yeah.

1411
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:24,913
That's cool.
Yeah,

1412
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,560
that's cool.
I was,

1413
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:31,180
but I wasn't walking back last night at
the crane academy.

1414
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,970
I was night.
I came back from Ventura,

1415
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,000
was teaching a workshop and I need some
let go something.

1416
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:39,540
I didn't want to lift weights.
The dojo empty.

1417
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,170
Why every bags,
gloves,

1418
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,160
et cetera.
Let's go.

1419
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,910
Yeah,
that's cool as well.

1420
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:47,200
Heavy bag I think is everybody would do
better if they had a heavy bag in the

1421
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:49,660
garage.
Just go out there and hit that thing.

1422
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:52,100
It feels good.
You don't even have to have great form.

1423
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:55,630
Just go out there and hit it.
It's so good for your body to just

1424
01:05:55,631 --> 01:05:58,450
explode and just release tension and
stress.

1425
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,230
And for people of like joint issues,
they have these water bags.

1426
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:07,840
It's essentially a thick layer of um,
the outside is like a thick layer of

1427
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:10,690
padding,
like a few inches of pad of foam.

1428
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:12,850
And then inside of that as a water
bladder,

1429
01:06:12,851 --> 01:06:15,780
it's filled with water.
So when you punch like your boss,

1430
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:18,790
your arm goes into it,
but you could really dig in and hit it

1431
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:21,370
hard,
but it doesn't have the same impact on

1432
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:23,860
your joints.
You don't feel it so much in your elbows

1433
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:28,770
and your shoulders and stuff because it
was given to a creativity once in

1434
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,650
Sicily,
you know,

1435
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,980
ever been easily.
That was the first time last year I went

1436
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:33,600
to Italy.
Cool.

1437
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,590
Loved it.
They're like,

1438
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,310
oh man.
I went to Rome,

1439
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,500
went to the Vatican,
saw the Vatican.

1440
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:39,740
We went to,
um,

1441
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:45,160
what is the mountain area?
Donate Dolomite?

1442
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:47,070
No,
goddammit.

1443
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,210
Alpine.
We,

1444
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:50,050
it was out near where the,
um,

1445
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,660
where the volcano killed everybody.
Vesuvius.

1446
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:53,411
Okay.
Okay.

1447
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:56,190
Yeah,
we went there and then we went to uh,

1448
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,730
the Mafia.
Amalfi coast.

1449
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,810
Yeah.
Beautiful.

1450
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,750
Oh Man.

1451
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:02,710
Amazing.
So beautiful.

1452
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:04,420
Didn't even seem real.
It seems like you were in front of a

1453
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:06,520
green screen.
You look out,

1454
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:08,600
you know you have to go on this mountain
roads.

1455
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:09,610
Crazy.
Joey.

1456
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,370
It's a road that should be one lane.
Should we one lane,

1457
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,170
but it's too.
And there's pluses on it.

1458
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,790
Fucking buses and motorcycles.
Assholes and motorcycle

1459
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,220
weaving in and out of cars.
People in Italy.

1460
01:07:21,221 --> 01:07:24,550
Dr. Like fucking maniacs like you had
never seen.

1461
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,610
We all know Italians are kinda crazy.
I'm mostly Italian.

1462
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:30,770
And you're going to have the left hand
steering wheel.

1463
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,800
It's regular.
Like regular.

1464
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,940
Yeah.
It's only lefthand in England and Japan.

1465
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,180
South Africa.
Yeah.

1466
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,250
You got into the car with a left right
here.

1467
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,860
Will Australia as well?
Australia.

1468
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,590
It's fucking confusing as shit.
You're like,

1469
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:48,330
where am I going on the wrong side.
If you have a.

1470
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:49,230
If you didn't,
never,

1471
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,130
never to driving.

1472
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,650
Oh yeah.
Because you have the shift with your

1473
01:07:53,651 --> 01:07:55,360
left hand is.
Oh yeah,

1474
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:57,220
but you,
you still love the clutch is still on

1475
01:07:57,221 --> 01:07:58,120
the lefthand side,
right?

1476
01:07:58,121 --> 01:08:01,030
And the pedal steel in the right to
adjust.

1477
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:03,080
But it would be the opposite version.
Yeah.

1478
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,720
So this is the what it's like on the
mouth of coast.

1479
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:07,420
So you're driving on this road.
This is what it's like.

1480
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:10,470
That's a two lane road jelly.
There's a fucking bus coming and you've

1481
01:08:10,471 --> 01:08:12,430
got to figure out how to get a car pass
that bus.

1482
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,010
And we were going like,
and I'm not exaggerating,

1483
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,580
half of a mile an hour

1484
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,160
trying to get past cars and buses.
Absolutely.

1485
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,800
It takes forever to get up there.
It should take 10 minutes.

1486
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,900
That's the road.
It should take 10 minutes.

1487
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:28,901
It takes 90,
but once you get up to the top,

1488
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,710
look at that picture.
Where you seeing the ocean?

1489
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:32,870
Jamie?
Like up in the right hand corner.

1490
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:33,800
Upper right?
Yeah.

1491
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,720
Like they're,
that's what it looks like when you.

1492
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,030
Once you finally get updated,
like wow,

1493
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,310
it's so pretty.
So pretty man.

1494
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:43,940
Italy's amazing.
The foods and the foods grow out of this

1495
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,070
world.
Fuck your gluten.

1496
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,680
You Bet.
All your gluten free bullshit.

1497
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:50,270
We've got to let that go.
When you're in.

1498
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,810
A lot of
people here say,

1499
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:55,730
Nah,
you go at least nothing like that.

1500
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:59,030
That's Americanized one.
It's more fish and stuff.

1501
01:08:59,031 --> 01:08:59,990
There's a lot of.
Well,

1502
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:01,710
they definitely did a lot of fish.
Do they use,

1503
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:02,960
do they still use gravy?

1504
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,660
Like red sauce?
Not so much.

1505
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,870
Not so much.
You could get it though and I think one

1506
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:11,030
of the reasons why you can get it is
because probably people have come over

1507
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:12,440
there and wanted it,
you know?

1508
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:13,970
Do you remember that episode was a
prime.

1509
01:09:13,971 --> 01:09:15,500
That was with the guy who it.
He's like,

1510
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:18,200
I want gravy and the one way to look at
the other one,

1511
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:20,060
he goes,
he's east coast.

1512
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:25,061
The talent's there was classes with the
Germans because he wanted spaghetti with

1513
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:27,620
gravy.
Big Old.

1514
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,570
Would you say gravy?
Like people are like,

1515
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:32,170
what is he talking great.
Like people think of like gray.

1516
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:33,720
No kids.
Yeah,

1517
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,530
it was spaghetti sauce.
Yeah,

1518
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,090
yeah,
yeah,

1519
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,600
yeah.
You can get Bolognese over there,

1520
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:44,630
but what it,
it's just the Americans that came over,

1521
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:47,330
they developed a different sort of style
of eating.

1522
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:48,680
Like a lot of meatballs.

1523
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,880
I got afraid though.
You don't like it when you come here as

1524
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:57,110
an immigrant.
Like when I came from Cuba,

1525
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,290
like when you're a white kid.
That's my,

1526
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,980
my,
my daughter Likes Alfredo.

1527
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,440
That shit's going to get cut off the
menu and like a month.

1528
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:06,080
But you know,
my fucking world.

1529
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:10,810
That's what people in Iowa.
That's the first Italian they eat.

1530
01:10:10,811 --> 01:10:12,990
Like how afraid you.
No,

1531
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,551
no,
no,

1532
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:15,380
no.
That's like a one month training thing.

1533
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,720
Like,
like I even had it out a little fucking

1534
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:20,210
job.
Like that's how Alfredo was.

1535
01:10:20,211 --> 01:10:21,044
Yeah.
When I was.

1536
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,020
When I came from Cuba and I've tasted
Italian for my mind blew up,

1537
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:24,891
you know?
Um,

1538
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:28,910
I was into all angles of it,
but the red sauce was last.

1539
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:33,560
I'm afraid though with fucking those
thick noodle sauce I'd like to give to a

1540
01:10:33,561 --> 01:10:36,530
fucking horse.
But what it looked like,

1541
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:38,660
chicken and Broccoli.

1542
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,570
Mushrooms.
Come on.

1543
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,710
Jamie's a good,
good.

1544
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,780
You grow out of,
out of that.

1545
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,140
It's not my first choice,
but I liked it.

1546
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:52,970
I didn't ever heard about that since
when I moved here in 91,

1547
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,050
92,
93.

1548
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:57,140
Everybody was asking me,
do you like 15 afraid of saying I don't

1549
01:10:57,141 --> 01:10:59,000
even know.
That's hilarious.

1550
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:01,710
No Italian.
I said not for me that

1551
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,960
it's like going somewhere in another
country.

1552
01:11:07,961 --> 01:11:12,290
I can tell you just the cheeseburgers on
American one of the meals.

1553
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:16,490
So you have bullet Asia,
but Robbie Yada have pacifiers rule you

1554
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:20,520
about that,
you know that the location that they

1555
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:22,290
call it.
No real name.

1556
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:26,490
Like Pasta Fagioli yeah.
They don't call it pasta pasta for

1557
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,250
little.
But then what's in the like we can't get

1558
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:30,510
that stuff.
He encountered Doug.

1559
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,830
What's that guy?
But go with one

1560
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,500
the green stuff to stop and catch your
Dick hard.

1561
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:45,350
I thought it was a blue.
What are you putting beans and um,

1562
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,950
that the green stuff.
It's not pesto.

1563
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,080
That's the best.
No,

1564
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,250
it's not spinach.
What

1565
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,330
they call.
It's two things.

1566
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,420
So you're talking about a type of
vegetable x.

1567
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:04,210
got old and being a girl gets you
deckard.

1568
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,540
Huh?
I think you did was just getting harder

1569
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:10,740
to make that shit.
November,

1570
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:13,050
you know,
I ain't possible.

1571
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,050
When I first tasted it,
I hated it every day for like 40 days.

1572
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:21,710
Like when I first went to my house,
I went from one 60 to one 94,

1573
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:25,920
just eating pasta for
me that's the only thing.

1574
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:29,760
They were lifting weights and possible.
You get jokes Jack.

1575
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:34,761
It's like taking the ball,
just pop those beans that's got old and

1576
01:12:37,681 --> 01:12:40,470
that in the winter with all that garlic
and stuff,

1577
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:42,750
you're off and running.
I didn't have a lot of fish.

1578
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:46,350
Like you had amazing drive by the Amalfi
coast.

1579
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:49,290
They had amazing seafood,
but the pasta was like a very light

1580
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:50,610
sauce.
Like a,

1581
01:12:50,611 --> 01:12:53,340
you know,
you get like if you go to a good place

1582
01:12:53,341 --> 01:12:56,940
and got like Linguini Vongole,
they'll give you a link with a very

1583
01:12:56,941 --> 01:13:01,941
light olive oil and garlic sauce with
the linguine and like that is the kind

1584
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:05,610
of like.
It's a very much more a delicate pasta.

1585
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,650
Yeah.
Because you're going to taste the fish

1586
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:09,440
flavor.
Yeah,

1587
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,021
yeah,
yeah,

1588
01:13:10,021 --> 01:13:12,090
yeah.
That's why if you try to go to a real

1589
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:13,800
Italian restaurant,
you ask for cheese,

1590
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:17,370
grated cheese on like Linguini vongole.
They'll look at you like you're a

1591
01:13:17,371 --> 01:13:19,700
fucking monster.
Who are you?

1592
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:21,710
You're not going to put the cheese on
the top of the fish.

1593
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,090
Yeah.
They'll say it's not recommend or not

1594
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:25,820
recommend.
They look at you like,

1595
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:27,241
don't do it,
and you're like,

1596
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:27,661
Nah,
Nah,

1597
01:13:27,661 --> 01:13:28,170
Nah,
Nah,

1598
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,340
come on,
come on.

1599
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,130
Hit me with it.
Like Kevin James and I used to always

1600
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:34,890
get Linguini and clams and he would get
pissed if they didn't come home with a

1601
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:36,390
cheese.
Like where's the guy with the cheese?

1602
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:39,510
I've got to have the grated cheese.
And you would try to put it on like at a

1603
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:40,620
good restaurant.
They would get.

1604
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,320
They get upset with you.
I don't want you putting that cheese on

1605
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:44,270
it.
If you have like,

1606
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:47,400
like a spaghetti Bolognese or something
like that,

1607
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:50,190
they'll,
they'll ask you next cheese then that

1608
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:52,560
makes sense.
But they don't even come near you.

1609
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,630
They'll try to stay away from your side
of the table.

1610
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:57,090
If you've got linguine with clams,
they don't want.

1611
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:59,100
They don't want to give it to you and
even red wine,

1612
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:01,350
red wine with fish to get mad.
They get mad.

1613
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,590
They get mad.
You're supposed to drink white wine was

1614
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:04,360
really.

1615
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,910
Yeah,
they get that upset with it.

1616
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:08,780
I don't drink white wine.
Dry white wine.

1617
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:11,980
I drink barely,
but red wine is better than y for me.

1618
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,670
I mean I'll drink white,
but I don't order it.

1619
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,250
Like if somebody pours me glad I'm not
going to.

1620
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,420
It's not awful,
but if I have a choice,

1621
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,340
it's always red.
I like red red.

1622
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:25,360
To me it's like it's got a flavor that's
compelling.

1623
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,740
It's interesting.
It's like,

1624
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:30,160
it's like it's a lie and it's white wine
is like chick drink.

1625
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,560
Sorry girls.
I drank a fucking.

1626
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:38,520
My mom used to have a bar and she had
night and we'd go home when I was real

1627
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:40,980
young,
like four or five in New York City and

1628
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:42,940
my mom would have a little classroom red
wine,

1629
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:47,290
the wine with the fucking Italian
paperwork on it that.

1630
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:48,683
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1631
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,870
yeah,
yeah.

1632
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,310
Like that shit.
So I was,

1633
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:56,030
I was maybe four,
maybe five,

1634
01:14:56,031 --> 01:14:58,640
and I would watch her one night I
watched it go to bed and I said,

1635
01:14:58,641 --> 01:15:01,320
fuck it.
And I took that bottle of wine.

1636
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:06,350
I fucking drank the whole thing.
She woke up like six hours later.

1637
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:08,600
They couldn't find me.
Call the police.

1638
01:15:08,601 --> 01:15:11,150
I was missing.
You were drunk as fuck and the closet

1639
01:15:11,151 --> 01:15:12,050
shit.
Pew.

1640
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:17,020
I never drank wine again three years
ago.

1641
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:19,640
Smell.
It's still get sick.

1642
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:23,240
I got sick.
I remember she telling me all the time,

1643
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:26,450
you will never like one because you got
so hammered.

1644
01:15:26,451 --> 01:15:28,670
That time.
We called the cops.

1645
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:31,250
We did everything.
They couldn't fucking find you a burger.

1646
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,930
What's your martial arts background?

1647
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,790
I started with boxing.
Regular boxing.

1648
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:40,970
Then I find that that time it was like
82 a big things easily was full contact.

1649
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,340
Karate,
those big named Ben.

1650
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:45,223
Ben.
Ben,

1651
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,960
Ben of the Gender Akita is out here,
man.

1652
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:52,020
He's from me.
I used to train his gym when I first

1653
01:15:52,021 --> 01:15:53,490
came here.
When it first came to California,

1654
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:55,810
Jedi blank.
De Blank was done in.

1655
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:59,780
And the palisade.
I believe this guy though.

1656
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,950
Yeah,
she blinky Rodriguez,

1657
01:16:01,951 --> 01:16:04,590
he was out here as well.
He's Benny's brother-in-law that's stuck

1658
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,970
with that and then we tie came and fell
in love.

1659
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,270
That's why my voice is my big thing for
that more type.

1660
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:14,670
Fucking change everybody's eyes.
As soon as you realize how hard it is to

1661
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:16,210
get kicked in the leg.
Well.

1662
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:17,690
Oh wait,
what?

1663
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:18,630
Yeah,
that was,

1664
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,040
I was like,
everybody,

1665
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:21,150
you know,
it never try know.

1666
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,530
The first time I went in to say,
okay,

1667
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,473
what is it going to be?

1668
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:24,341
Nothing different,
you know,

1669
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:27,690
it's like being around that was kicking
the legs and they hate me.

1670
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:33,150
I remember I couldn't walk for a couple
of days and man fall in love.

1671
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:37,260
So like more dyes that are competing
with karate style,

1672
01:16:37,261 --> 01:16:40,800
with the Shin a,
whether we're the instep rather you

1673
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:44,130
kicking with the top of the foot.
Everybody had this idea like that was

1674
01:16:44,131 --> 01:16:46,970
the way to do it.
And then the moment you get kicked with

1675
01:16:46,971 --> 01:16:49,170
a Shin you go,
oh,

1676
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:52,770
that's a.
and they got a lot of injury for kicking

1677
01:16:52,771 --> 01:16:54,250
on the East App.
Oh yeah.

1678
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:55,860
On my ankle was.
Yeah,

1679
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:59,960
he was devastated.
So need to recondition your mind like we

1680
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:03,750
discussed in the beginning of a Shin
kick change.

1681
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,520
Then during the past,
you know,

1682
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:08,370
for,
for the skewer to investigate different

1683
01:17:08,371 --> 01:17:10,580
style,
different and

1684
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:12,450
defend.
The guy that changed my,

1685
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:15,800
my way to see things transferred,
not to competition or to,

1686
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:18,620
to to my line of duty was a guy in
Israel,

1687
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,610
but it's because it's been into for war
three.

1688
01:17:22,611 --> 01:17:24,830
A man is like,
become like a second father for me.

1689
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:26,120
And he always told me,
you know,

1690
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,170
it's the spirit.
I don't care the way that you punch,

1691
01:17:29,171 --> 01:17:32,900
the way you kicking in until your
mindset is not on point,

1692
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,010
he's not going to be the not going to be
ready to do something for real.

1693
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:38,570
You know,
it's so that they can tell you,

1694
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:40,630
do carotid,
do Jujitsu,

1695
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,320
do they do that?
But if your mindset,

1696
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,320
real things,
when you go to war,

1697
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:48,520
you do you need to apply these fins for
change.

1698
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:51,920
I think he's right,
but he's also not right because I think

1699
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,070
he's right in the sense that your
mindset must be correct in order for you

1700
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,410
to apply any,
any sort of martial arts in

1701
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:58,950
international competition.
Absolutely,

1702
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,790
but it's always important to have the
right technique.

1703
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:02,531
Oh yeah.
No,

1704
01:18:02,531 --> 01:18:02,841
no,
no.

1705
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:04,550
I don't miss.
Maybe I miss same.

1706
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:08,090
Israel was working on already on.
He never believed in.

1707
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:12,270
Is there an Israeli guy he say
introduced the Jujitsu a lot,

1708
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:16,490
introduce to do the Bj Bjj and his
system to do the bottle or the box and

1709
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:19,040
we tie,
so you need to have the full aspect of

1710
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:22,790
that.
And then of course if you go into the

1711
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,060
Australian special forces there,
the secret service and you need to have

1712
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:29,090
the right guy to do that.
Some people are not ready to be a

1713
01:18:29,091 --> 01:18:31,990
warrior.
Can train like a warrior now warrior.

1714
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:34,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

1715
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:37,670
I can only imagine.
Especially like Krav Maga in the United

1716
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:40,430
States,
there's legit Krav Maga schools in the

1717
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:42,320
United States for sure.
There's really good instruction is

1718
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:44,240
really good,
but there's also a lot of fucking

1719
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,490
horseshit.
Just like with karate,

1720
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:50,420
like there's a lot of mall karate where
you go to these places and they might be

1721
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:53,330
fine for little kids.
They're learning little martial arts,

1722
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:54,620
learning,
little discipline,

1723
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,510
they have goals,
you know,

1724
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,540
I want to get my orange belt and they
get it and they get excited and it's

1725
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:00,920
good for them.
It's good for their mind,

1726
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,200
but it's,
it's,

1727
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:06,020
it's really critical when you're
learning a martial art,

1728
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:08,840
one of the most important thing is to
find a legitimate instructor.

1729
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:13,490
It's the most important thing because
relearning things is so hard.

1730
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,490
Back when I was teaching,
when I taught someone,

1731
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:18,620
they didn't know.
If they didn't know anything,

1732
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:20,750
they came to me with no martial arts
experience.

1733
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:24,170
It was so much easier than if someone
came to me with bad martial arts

1734
01:19:24,171 --> 01:19:28,280
experience because if you have a.
like if he took karate for a few years

1735
01:19:28,281 --> 01:19:31,040
from some Bozo and you did everything
all wrong,

1736
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,310
I would have to reteach you so when you
would panic,

1737
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:37,010
if you would get nervous,
you would go right back to that old way.

1738
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,850
Like as soon as someone puts the
pressure on you,

1739
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:40,820
you would go right back to the old
shitty technique.

1740
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:46,270
That's exactly what it's still about.
What is your learning and the movement

1741
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:50,870
that is in your brain is the same
position or whatever you will achieve a

1742
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,780
you put into the other way is wrong.
You're under stress.

1743
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:56,270
Is gonna repeat the same face.
That's where the everything man,

1744
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,960
even for pool,
like there's certain techniques that

1745
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,540
people learn where they don't learn how
to do pool correctly.

1746
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:05,930
You only playing billiards,
you stand the wrong way and you get used

1747
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:08,760
to it and when you're in a match and
there's a lot on the line,

1748
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:12,930
you go right back to the old ways.
Even if you take lessons like it's so

1749
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:17,250
important that when you learn things in
life to learn them right the first time.

1750
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:19,680
That's why when you're growing up as a
human being,

1751
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,800
I think it's been an issue with me.
I think it's been an issue with you as

1752
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:24,120
well.
When you.

1753
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:29,150
Your childhood is kind of fucking crazy.
Like you develop these ways of thinking

1754
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,350
and acting as a child that are very
difficult to break as you get older and

1755
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:37,350
you get as an adult,
it's like you have this foundation

1756
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:40,500
that's a very faulty and you have to be
cognizantly aware.

1757
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:42,930
You have to be consciously aware of
that.

1758
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,060
Okay,
this foundation is fucked up because I

1759
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:49,920
grew up with domestic violence and I
grew up with no dad and so I have to

1760
01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:54,390
make sure that I don't fall into these
patterns that I had established in my

1761
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,700
head when I was eight,
nine and 10 and 11.

1762
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,410
You know,
as you're growing up as a,

1763
01:20:58,411 --> 01:21:00,660
as an adult,
this is the way you're looking at life

1764
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:02,370
and then you have to kind of
restructure.

1765
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:04,200
It almost sounds like you're starting
over,

1766
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:09,060
but if you meet someone who has like a
great father and a great mother and they

1767
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:12,370
grow up and they have like a great
fundamental balance by this.

1768
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,780
Those people used to always make me
nervous when I was a kid because I was

1769
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:16,740
always like,
God,

1770
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:19,200
like these.
I don't even know anybody like that.

1771
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:20,720
I got on.
I don't like,

1772
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,970
I would feel like inferior to them,
like when I was around people that had a

1773
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:27,450
good childhood,
I would feel inferior.

1774
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:30,000
I still do.
You sure?

1775
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:34,650
I feel.
I feel weird if I like I have,

1776
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:37,890
I have friends that I think about them
now when I go,

1777
01:21:37,891 --> 01:21:42,420
I want to really interview their parents
like what did they do to get this kid to

1778
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:43,410
be such a fucking?

1779
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:49,160
What was the recipe to get this child to
be fucking superhuman being,

1780
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,940
and I'm not talking about Julia
servings,

1781
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:57,950
father or fucking gsps debt.
I'm talking about people who you meet in

1782
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:01,530
life that I really fair,
that are really kind.

1783
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:06,450
I look at those people and I go,
I wondered what their parents did with

1784
01:22:06,451 --> 01:22:07,010
that.
Mike.

1785
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:12,010
Good to have that ability to want to
help people and go out of that way.

1786
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,820
You know,
I always think about that shit.

1787
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:17,370
Especially now as a parent,
you're like,

1788
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:21,630
what is the fucking chemistry of love
for them to understand?

1789
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,960
You know,
we were talking on the way up there when

1790
01:22:24,961 --> 01:22:26,040
my mother died,
you know,

1791
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:30,720
it was the seventies and let's face it,
we were still specs and that New Jersey

1792
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:31,830
neighborhood,
you know,

1793
01:22:31,831 --> 01:22:34,530
in Boston and those areas,
you hear things,

1794
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,920
but I remember those Italian kids coming
to my mom's wake and they couldn't make

1795
01:22:40,111 --> 01:22:44,070
eye contact with me.
The same ones that would say spic or

1796
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:49,071
whatever because I short circuited that.
I broke them because the number one

1797
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:50,550
word,
admittedly his mama,

1798
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,860
right.
That's it.

1799
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,050
That's it.
When you're in town and everything,

1800
01:22:55,051 --> 01:22:57,870
his Mama,
they would come to that wake and I would

1801
01:22:57,871 --> 01:23:02,450
short circuit them because they never
could think of that situation that

1802
01:23:02,451 --> 01:23:05,980
happened to them and I'm still friends
with those people today

1803
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:09,070
and I always wondered why,
you know,

1804
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:13,990
who raised him that that super great
people and then you come here to a place

1805
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:18,991
like California and you meet people and
they have nice parents or whatever,

1806
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,610
potentially the biggest scumbags in the
fucking world.

1807
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,330
Do you follow them?
That's what interest me in my life.

1808
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,760
I always feel like those people,
the parents probably weren't around that

1809
01:23:27,761 --> 01:23:30,460
much or I might be really nice people,
but they didn't,

1810
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:35,461
they weren't around to really install
the right ideals and values and morals

1811
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:39,220
in their system.
You know,

1812
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:43,450
maybe the parents were off at fucking
swinger parties or some shit.

1813
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,840
I always look at that,
you know,

1814
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:48,130
with uh,
even the kids I grew up like I have a

1815
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:52,330
friend that his dad was little but his
mother was solid.

1816
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:55,480
And when you say his dad was a little,
you mean gang?

1817
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,370
I'll put a bullet in your fucking eye
ball.

1818
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,200
I'll put a bullet in your eyeball at
lunch,

1819
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,500
you know,
I mean,

1820
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:04,090
when I would hang out with them,
people's parents would come to me and

1821
01:24:04,091 --> 01:24:06,790
go,
I wouldn't be going over there if I was.

1822
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:09,430
You really see the article on his dad?
Yeah.

1823
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:10,303
Oh,
he's a psycho.

1824
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:10,751
No,
no,

1825
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:12,090
no.
He was a crazy.

1826
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:13,890
We're just a street guy.
Okay.

1827
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:17,540
And you know,
today the kid is one of my best friends.

1828
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:20,310
Never had a problem,
never had a law problem.

1829
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,760
Never.
No record,

1830
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:24,370
never check it.
Married children.

1831
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:25,001
Well,
you know,

1832
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:27,880
there's people that grow up with
horrible environments and they come out

1833
01:24:27,881 --> 01:24:30,130
amazing and then their brothers and
sisters are all in jail.

1834
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:35,310
It's weird how a person makes choices in
their life that really establishes their

1835
01:24:35,831 --> 01:24:38,800
entire life and a lot of that,
those choices,

1836
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,121
man,
I hate to say it,

1837
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:40,960
but it could be luck.

1838
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:45,760
They could've made a lucky choice early
on and that lucky choice led them down a

1839
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:48,910
better road than someone who's made,
made a poor choice.

1840
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,570
Like kids that get involved in the
juvenile detention system when they're

1841
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:55,900
really young boy that fucks them up.
So was a horrible,

1842
01:24:57,910 --> 01:25:02,010
horrible and a good friends can know
good people are on juveniles and again

1843
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,790
continued the right things.
You know,

1844
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:08,350
even even if it's hard when he's telling
you the truth and the of sounds like a

1845
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,990
smack be on their ads,
but make you open your eyes.

1846
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,920
Make you say,
you know what?

1847
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:15,160
A kid,
once you put a kid in one of those

1848
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:18,270
gladiator,
a prisons,

1849
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,260
the percentages,
just like we were just talking about

1850
01:25:20,261 --> 01:25:23,560
that movie that came out of sleepers,
all four of them went away.

1851
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:28,380
Two of them came out to become westies.
The other two came out to be decent.

1852
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:31,000
The percentages,
it's 50 fucking percent.

1853
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:31,973
Yeah,
and that's,

1854
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:34,780
that's on the,
that's on the conservative side,

1855
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:39,820
right into the higher you.
Once you get that first tattoo and smoke

1856
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:41,830
that first cigarette,
all those things,

1857
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,420
your percentages go deeper and deeper.
You know,

1858
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,910
once you get the tattoo knuckles that
say fuck good,

1859
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,160
Mike Tyson got the face tattoo at 40.
Everything had already all the bad stuff

1860
01:25:54,161 --> 01:25:56,230
out of his life.
He had already come through,

1861
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:59,350
but it might Tyson with a cane with that
face tattoo at 18.

1862
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:01,030
You know,
it's so weird.

1863
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:04,160
Like how I saw it,
I saw people on the bottom

1864
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,890
that today,
that successful in the police records

1865
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:08,750
don't matter,
nothing matters.

1866
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,390
Yeah.
And then I saw other people who were

1867
01:26:11,391 --> 01:26:14,990
like sneaky people who now they're in
trouble for tax evasion.

1868
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:17,660
You know what I'm saying?
Like there's always.

1869
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,710
Yeah,
my mother was a big things for me.

1870
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,640
Like I said,
Mama,

1871
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:24,770
my mind had been burned.
My mother,

1872
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:27,100
she always told me to give it more that
you can do,

1873
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:30,530
you want him to receive the Dapa.
And then it was a bit told me,

1874
01:26:30,531 --> 01:26:32,240
you know,
like be,

1875
01:26:32,241 --> 01:26:33,530
you know,
straight to people,

1876
01:26:33,531 --> 01:26:34,101
you know,
don't,

1877
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:36,590
don't,
don't fort around yourself so you're not

1878
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:39,280
going to force it on people.
And I believe that things,

1879
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:40,670
you know.
Yeah.

1880
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:43,280
It also helps if,
you know people that work hard.

1881
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,130
When I was a kid,
um,

1882
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:48,530
my,
my best friends had jobs and they worked

1883
01:26:48,531 --> 01:26:50,120
hard.
They were constantly working.

1884
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,830
There were always working at a young
age.

1885
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,950
Yeah.
My friend Jimmy and Jimmy Law,

1886
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:56,910
I'm still buddies with them to this day,
but we were in high school.

1887
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:00,530
I was fucking guys always worked in high
school and high school.

1888
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:03,650
I always worked,
always worked at construction jobs,

1889
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,750
always worked.
I had construction jobs too because my

1890
01:27:05,751 --> 01:27:07,500
dad was an architect.
My Stepdad,

1891
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,560
um,
uh,

1892
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:12,380
always set me up with these construction
crews and stuff.

1893
01:27:12,381 --> 01:27:16,970
So I did these jobs that we're in.
So it gave me the understanding that you

1894
01:27:16,971 --> 01:27:19,460
like,
like if you've never worked hard and you

1895
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:22,430
don't know what the fuck hard work is,
then all of a sudden you're 18 and then

1896
01:27:22,431 --> 01:27:24,560
you're in college and then you got out
of college,

1897
01:27:24,561 --> 01:27:27,710
then you have to get a job.
You have no real experience with actual

1898
01:27:27,711 --> 01:27:31,430
difficult work.
I just don't think you appreciate what

1899
01:27:31,431 --> 01:27:36,431
it takes to get by and growing up,
seeing people that had a strong work

1900
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:41,360
ethic and realizing that that wasn't
something that I had,

1901
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:44,210
but maybe it was something that I need
to consider as being like a very

1902
01:27:44,211 --> 01:27:46,730
important skill,
a very important trait.

1903
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:51,410
The ability to just actually get shit
done to get up in the morning when your

1904
01:27:51,411 --> 01:27:54,470
alarm clock goes off and go,
you're uncomfortable,

1905
01:27:54,471 --> 01:27:56,090
you want to stay in bed,
it's cold out.

1906
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,710
You don't want to do it.
That,

1907
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,710
that ability to just do it,
just get up and do it.

1908
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,350
You know that old Nike slogan,
just do it.

1909
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:07,040
It's one of the best fucking slogan of
all time.

1910
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:09,260
You know what I mean?
People actually went out and worked out

1911
01:28:09,261 --> 01:28:11,720
just because that just do it.
That might've been like the most

1912
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:15,650
effective ad campaign in the history of
ad campaigns when it came to actually

1913
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:18,920
getting people to do things that are
uncomfortable and something that

1914
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:23,921
actually made sense.
Just do it so fucking so important.

1915
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:27,830
It's so important.
Just gotTa fucking get things done and

1916
01:28:27,831 --> 01:28:29,840
for so many people,
like you were talking about the

1917
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:31,250
beginning of the podcast,
show me that book,

1918
01:28:31,251 --> 01:28:33,620
the war of art where it talks about
resistance.

1919
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:36,830
There's so many people that just fuck
off.

1920
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,340
They fuck off and they don't get the
things done that need to get done and

1921
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:42,800
that haunts them.
We know it as comics.

1922
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,140
We know so many guys that told write new
material.

1923
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,180
They just don't.
They just don't.

1924
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,070
They don't work.
They don't work.

1925
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,440
You know why?
Because when you have new material man,

1926
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:54,200
sometimes it doesn't go well.
Sometimes you bomb.

1927
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:58,460
Sometimes you go up and it's clunky.
It's not ready and when you do a special

1928
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:01,010
like will you just released a special.
You know what it's like,

1929
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,330
you didn't need that materials

1930
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,610
dead now and so now you have to write
all new material and you have a bunch of

1931
01:29:05,611 --> 01:29:06,940
people that are coming to pay to see
you.

1932
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:07,823
Oh my God.
It's

1933
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:12,160
always good.
Yeah.

1934
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:15,090
I panicked every fucking week.
Every week when I go on the road I

1935
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:18,460
panicked because I don't have a full 50
minutes of.

1936
01:29:18,461 --> 01:29:20,970
Nope.
I got a couple fucking minutes and I'm

1937
01:29:20,971 --> 01:29:23,400
trying out new shit constantly.
Constantly.

1938
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,250
But can it comes together slowly but
surely together,

1939
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,860
but it's just like anything else.
It's sticking with it.

1940
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:32,280
Right now I'm in a slump.
So what do you do as a baseball player?

1941
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,750
Jamie?
When you're in a slump,

1942
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:35,700
what do you do as a baseball player?
You quit.

1943
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:38,550
No,
you keep fucking hitting and you keep

1944
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:41,190
striking out.
You keep fucking striking out and you

1945
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:43,860
keep it together.
You cannot lose it.

1946
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:48,890
I Eka Tony Perez,
1976 slash 75 against the Boston red

1947
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:50,160
sox.

1948
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:50,651
He went,
oh,

1949
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:53,780
for 17 in the series and then game
seven,

1950
01:29:53,781 --> 01:29:57,000
he hit the single that chains.
They won the world series really?

1951
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,000
So he could have just said,
I don't want to do it.

1952
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,860
I know I'm going to comedian slump.
Well,

1953
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:05,100
not anymore now,
but like in December and January it was

1954
01:30:05,101 --> 01:30:08,220
fucking heavy jack.
But you just got to work yourself

1955
01:30:08,221 --> 01:30:10,740
through it.
There's no other way to get yourself

1956
01:30:10,741 --> 01:30:11,390
through it.
It's.

1957
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,830
There's no other way.
There's no other.

1958
01:30:12,831 --> 01:30:15,150
There's no other way you don't want.
And for me,

1959
01:30:15,151 --> 01:30:16,740
I could lie to you and say,
well,

1960
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:19,050
I'm not going to get on stage.
I'm going to stay home and write for the

1961
01:30:19,051 --> 01:30:20,480
next three months.
That's not good enough.

1962
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:22,530
Wrong answer,
Jack.

1963
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,050
That's not going to work.
It's not going to know.

1964
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:27,480
You've got to keep going to the well,
like right now I have a problem.

1965
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:31,500
You know,
last year I have such a fear of being on

1966
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:34,440
my back and Jujitsu that it really
fucking made me.

1967
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:38,370
I will not quit.
I will not quit because what happens if

1968
01:30:38,371 --> 01:30:40,620
I'm on with Joe,
I'm with my family one day and I got

1969
01:30:40,621 --> 01:30:42,570
kicked in the stomach and I'm on my
back.

1970
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:45,360
Am I going to panic so I cannot fucking
quit.

1971
01:30:45,361 --> 01:30:49,020
So I kept going back to digital,
but the weird thing was I was doing it

1972
01:30:49,021 --> 01:30:52,800
wrong even though I was putting in the
time I wasn't working on my breathing.

1973
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:57,630
I thought that by me going three times a
week and doing what a fighter does,

1974
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:02,640
stay in the and that fighting three
times a year that my breathing would

1975
01:31:02,641 --> 01:31:04,800
come together.
It will come together.

1976
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:07,500
But then little not,
not good,

1977
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,270
not good delivery.
Like,

1978
01:31:09,271 --> 01:31:11,970
you know what I'm saying?
Like the time I put in for what I get

1979
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:13,620
back wasn't rewarding enough.

1980
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,980
Like I would think of going to a
different approach.

1981
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:18,810
So.
And then I started doing those little

1982
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:20,760
things with Alberto when the back when I
get there,

1983
01:31:20,761 --> 01:31:22,620
the breathing.
You know what man?

1984
01:31:22,621 --> 01:31:24,840
I'm a big boy now.
You don't have to tell me Dick.

1985
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:29,070
I know I got something wrong with the
back of my head with that fear Shit and

1986
01:31:29,071 --> 01:31:31,830
it with the needles and what did I do
with the needles?

1987
01:31:31,831 --> 01:31:33,000
Dope.
I could faint,

1988
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:35,640
faint.
Walking into a doctor's office.

1989
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,150
I could smell cotton.
I can't smell shit.

1990
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:43,620
I could smell fucking cotton.
Like walk into a doctor's office.

1991
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,740
I could smell that.
Associates with fear.

1992
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,440
Tremendous.
When I walk into a doctor's office,

1993
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:52,330
my blood pressure is 190 over one 60
dogs.

1994
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:55,380
They look at me and go,
how were you walking?

1995
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:56,220
I go,
take a hike,

1996
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:59,980
come back in 10 minutes.
And once my doctor comes back and

1997
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,510
he starts talking to me and we talk
about Chicago beef sandwiches,

1998
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:06,190
he goes,
watch this.

1999
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,710
And it's 1:40 over 80.
I figured,

2000
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:09,570
right?
I know,

2001
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:11,080
I know.
I lived through this.

2002
01:32:11,081 --> 01:32:11,940
I lived through it.

2003
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,580
It's a four.
It's all about for me,

2004
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:15,650
when a train people,
you know,

2005
01:32:15,651 --> 01:32:16,650
I tried to say,
okay,

2006
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:20,220
you're doing tempo shop and if you come
to the eight,

2007
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,980
the number eight and you'll see that you
start to struggle.

2008
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:27,330
Does that stop?
I don't allow you to do a bad number,

2009
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,230
a number nine because I know number nine
is going to be a bad push up.

2010
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,453
So.
But for them.

2011
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:34,230
So what happened?
When you got to be under stress,

2012
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,480
you're going to be repeating the best
for them.

2013
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:39,510
So for me it's the constantly I try to
remap you,

2014
01:32:39,511 --> 01:32:40,920
like you said before,
when you were teaching,

2015
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:44,430
remapping the way that you always try to
achieve the best.

2016
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:45,600
So like you said,
just do it.

2017
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:46,500
What I say.
Okay.

2018
01:32:46,501 --> 01:32:49,290
You need to repeat the things and to you
never do it wrong.

2019
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,940
Don't do it right.
You'll never do wrong.

2020
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:53,980
Right?
Once you can come from blackness is a

2021
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:57,000
like shot,
I want you to learn how to do it right

2022
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:00,600
every single time and that's when we can
step forward to the next level.

2023
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:03,260
Do you subscribe to that?
Pavel Salini,

2024
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:08,030
you know he's got that strong first.
Allow the ideology where you don't do,

2025
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:11,000
you don't do the failure ever.
And I do that now.

2026
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,770
So that's how I do all my work.
I don't,

2027
01:33:12,771 --> 01:33:15,830
I don't lift to failure ever.
Like say if I could do 10 reps or

2028
01:33:15,831 --> 01:33:18,260
something,
I do five and then I wait like 10

2029
01:33:18,261 --> 01:33:20,330
minutes and not do another five.
Then I'll wait 10 minutes,

2030
01:33:20,331 --> 01:33:21,920
I'll do another five.
They don't like 10 minutes.

2031
01:33:21,921 --> 01:33:24,800
I'll do another five.
And the idea being that it's more

2032
01:33:24,801 --> 01:33:29,801
important to do more workouts in the
week with low repetition than it is to

2033
01:33:29,901 --> 01:33:34,130
do a high repetition workout.
Like you know where the guy's like,

2034
01:33:34,131 --> 01:33:35,710
come on,
spot me last one.

2035
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:39,860
That's not good.
Your body's not designed to do that.

2036
01:33:39,861 --> 01:33:42,560
Your body's not designed to be at
failure ever.

2037
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,530
So what you're supposed to do is build
yourself up.

2038
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:49,850
So you're doing these exercises and he
says that you should think of them as a

2039
01:33:49,851 --> 01:33:51,980
skill.
That strength strengthens a skill.

2040
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:54,590
So each exercise you're doing,
you don't want to be tired when you're

2041
01:33:54,591 --> 01:33:56,390
doing a skill,
you don't want to be completely

2042
01:33:56,391 --> 01:34:00,380
exhausted when you're trying to pull
back a bow and Arrow or shoot a pool

2043
01:34:00,381 --> 01:34:03,830
game or shoot a ball and pool.
What you want to do is you want to have

2044
01:34:03,831 --> 01:34:07,430
that cemented in your mind when he calls
greasing the groove,

2045
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,700
like each time you do it,
you'd do it perfect.

2046
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:13,730
You do it with perfect form and you just
do low repetitions with heavyweights.

2047
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,600
Absolutely.
You know Pablo and trump first.

2048
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:18,030
But if it's another amazing,
it's cool.

2049
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:20,620
Yes.
And one of my coach of strength

2050
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:22,100
conditioning.
Yeah.

2051
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:24,580
And yeah,
that's what I do for myself.

2052
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:26,590
He didn't even because of those flights,
you know,

2053
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,380
my jet lag,
my cns machine,

2054
01:34:28,381 --> 01:34:31,840
none of the assistant medical already
what I do when I train,

2055
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:35,660
I never,
I'd maybe I'll every four week I tried

2056
01:34:35,661 --> 01:34:39,610
to do one or two reps and 95 percent.
I never tried to do a personal record.

2057
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:43,390
I always liked to work like 85 percent
few reps show.

2058
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:47,300
Even psychologically I know that I can
enter the good form at that level and

2059
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,270
never got out

2060
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:53,650
for people who are interested in this.
Go go to a pavle has a lot of stuff

2061
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:55,180
online,
but I think some of the best stuff

2062
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:57,320
online is him on the Tim Ferriss
podcast.

2063
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:57,980
Really

2064
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,010
excellent stuff and you know,
he's got his own books out there and

2065
01:35:01,011 --> 01:35:03,440
he's got books on tape and he's got
videos and you could see a lot of his

2066
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:06,080
videos,
but his method is so good.

2067
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:09,110
It's so.
It's so smart and it's made big

2068
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:10,220
differences with me.
First of all,

2069
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:15,221
it's cut my injuries down radically,
like radically because I would be doing

2070
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:15,980
these,
you know,

2071
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:18,770
12,
15 repetitions with heavyweight and like

2072
01:35:18,771 --> 01:35:23,771
barely getting the 13th one and then the
14th and then you know,

2073
01:35:24,121 --> 01:35:27,860
your forum gets all fucking sloppy.
Your back's bending in a weird way.

2074
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,420
It's terrible for you.
It would be terrible.

2075
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:30,970
We've been totally that.
Just,

2076
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:32,140
you know.
Yeah,

2077
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:33,110
no pain,
no gain.

2078
01:35:33,111 --> 01:35:35,120
That was shit.
No,

2079
01:35:35,121 --> 01:35:37,100
that's not how you,
it's so dumb.

2080
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:41,270
But now I'm lucky that I have weights at
home so I have kettle bells at home so I

2081
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:44,000
can do it four days a week,
five days a week and I'll work out for

2082
01:35:44,001 --> 01:35:44,750
an hour.

2083
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,460
I'll just go in there.
It's 8:00 in the morning.

2084
01:35:46,461 --> 01:35:48,950
I start lifting,
I'm done in an hour and I'm not even

2085
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:50,840
exhausted.
Not only am I not exhausted,

2086
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:52,850
I feel kind of pumped up and kind of
charged,

2087
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:54,260
but I'm not like,
oh,

2088
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,950
like I used to work out sometimes,
like back in the day I would do lifts

2089
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:00,200
and uh,
by the time the lift was over,

2090
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:01,850
my fault,
I was light headed,

2091
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:05,430
my legs were shaking,
I could barely walk and you don't have

2092
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:08,120
any energy left to do things and I've
try to go to Jujitsu.

2093
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:11,360
Hilarious.
I would just get mauled,

2094
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:13,760
just couldn't do it,
you know,

2095
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:15,830
it'd be fucking wrecked for like two or
three days.

2096
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:19,640
So I'd be really nervous to lift in the
morning and then do Jujitsu at night

2097
01:36:19,641 --> 01:36:23,090
because I would know that I was going to
be operating at like 50 percent or 60

2098
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:23,840
percent.

2099
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:28,370
I'll just get my ass kicked.
But if you do kettle bells with low

2100
01:36:28,371 --> 01:36:30,200
repetitions,
even with heavy weight,

2101
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:33,170
you could do a real good workout.
And then that night you could work

2102
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:36,110
Jujitsu and you can be 100 percent close
to a bluff.

2103
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,460
Pavel,
Pavel Tatsumi will tattoo you in touch

2104
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,210
with Leni Habib.
He also wanted like,

2105
01:36:44,211 --> 01:36:47,060
he doesn't,
he wants you to finish the Kettlebell

2106
01:36:47,061 --> 01:36:50,440
workout energized.
He doesn't want you to finish it.

2107
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,710
He doesn't want that at all.
I read that.

2108
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:55,910
That's this whole thing.
God wants you to finish.

2109
01:36:55,911 --> 01:36:59,710
They're ready to go take on the world.
And I tell you I was,

2110
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:01,660
I called Joe or they go joe,
you to go,

2111
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:05,990
you gave me the kettle bells.
I love doing cleans.

2112
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:09,150
I love doing the gun slings,
but you know,

2113
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:14,470
I try to do 10 sets of 10,
12 swings and 10 minutes and I would do

2114
01:37:15,531 --> 01:37:18,410
that and I've achieved my goal and I'd
be very happy.

2115
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,630
But then I couldn't go to Jujitsu for
three days.

2116
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:22,370
Yeah.
So what the fuck did I do?

2117
01:37:22,371 --> 01:37:24,900
I'm 53,
you know,

2118
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,120
but I would go,
I did it,

2119
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:31,150
that had five sets of cleans with two
fives and then a jump rope and then try

2120
01:37:32,241 --> 01:37:35,390
to do setups and then for three days of
dog shit,

2121
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:37,940
dog shit.
And I called him up and he goes,

2122
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:40,850
go cut it in half.
And then I said,

2123
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,190
you know what?
I'm only going to do my weights now.

2124
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:47,300
On the road when I go to a hotel now,
every two weeks I work every other week

2125
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,910
I'll hit the dumbbells and do the
elliptical,

2126
01:37:49,911 --> 01:37:53,190
but when I'm in town I'll just do the
tactile,

2127
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,980
the beginning,
a little it Jujitsu and then

2128
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,770
I'd do attack with at the end.
And you know what man,

2129
01:37:58,771 --> 01:38:01,460
I don't want to walk around hunched up
when I'm 60.

2130
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,920
I got a four year old.
I got to be around and be.

2131
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,050
I liked it.
I could touch my toes,

2132
01:38:07,051 --> 01:38:08,310
you know,
I like all this stuff.

2133
01:38:08,311 --> 01:38:12,810
But one thing I noticed about tax fit
that there's a couple movies that they

2134
01:38:12,811 --> 01:38:14,880
put in there.
I don't know if you did it or somebody

2135
01:38:14,881 --> 01:38:17,190
did that,
that Jujitsu friendly.

2136
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:20,760
Oh yeah.
Like the moving movement to know if you

2137
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:24,960
look at when you look,
even the kids rolling around when is a,

2138
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,440
his early stage.
You go through something like,

2139
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:29,670
you know,
double as they can transfer machine box

2140
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:31,680
or whatever.
You can go into the rolling into the

2141
01:38:31,681 --> 01:38:33,210
garden.
So we got to talk to them like,

2142
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,133
oh sorry.
So sorry.

2143
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:39,160
So again you can see moving his moment.
So what we would start to do it start to

2144
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:45,240
analyze those moments and try to get a
mechanical information about those

2145
01:38:45,241 --> 01:38:46,074
moments.
Yeah.

2146
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:49,590
But the APP,
they apply very well on transition for

2147
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:52,910
some Jujitsu and that's another things
that are bad.

2148
01:38:52,911 --> 01:38:55,740
There was no,
it was blowing his mind.

2149
01:38:55,870 --> 01:39:00,390
Say if I get the guys to move better,
it's easier for me to pass the technique

2150
01:39:00,391 --> 01:39:01,224
because they,
they,

2151
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:03,690
of course,
they already know it.

2152
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:07,180
One of the things that Eddie founders,
that guys who are break dancers,

2153
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,110
yes,
excelled in Jujitsu.

2154
01:39:09,470 --> 01:39:11,480
And uh,
there's a kid who fought this past

2155
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:13,100
weekend,
landover Nada in Orlando.

2156
01:39:13,101 --> 01:39:15,290
Vanana groovy.
Lando fought this past weekend.

2157
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:18,080
He fought David Tamer.
Crazy fight was a co main event.

2158
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,910
Lando has only been striking for six
years and,

2159
01:39:21,911 --> 01:39:24,950
but he's phenomenal.
But what happened was he started with a

2160
01:39:24,951 --> 01:39:28,460
BMX background.
He was a pro bmx racer and was like

2161
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:32,030
apparently like a national champion and
bmx and that pumping,

2162
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,310
pumping bike legs,
you know,

2163
01:39:34,311 --> 01:39:38,270
just be being able to like,
like generate extreme speed off the

2164
01:39:38,271 --> 01:39:40,700
line.
He developed as explosive ability to use

2165
01:39:40,701 --> 01:39:44,930
his legs.
And so that like having cross training,

2166
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:48,800
whether it's through tack fit or whether
it's through yoga or whether it's two

2167
01:39:48,801 --> 01:39:51,530
kettlebells or break dancing or anything
else.

2168
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:53,750
Shaka for Aldo.
Oh yeah.

2169
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:56,140
Soccer for all those bridges,
sprinting,

2170
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:57,380
sprinting,
they do.

2171
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:01,550
And all the kicking they do in soccer.
The learning how to move your body.

2172
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:05,660
Like look at what's going on with conor
mcgregor that ido parked out there.

2173
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:10,580
He's concentrating so much on movement
and movement is just a huge factor in

2174
01:40:10,581 --> 01:40:15,320
his success because his ability to
dictate like where first of all its

2175
01:40:15,321 --> 01:40:19,490
ability to move in and out is better
than almost anybody's.

2176
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:23,480
His ability to get out of the way and
his ability to move in close and move

2177
01:40:23,481 --> 01:40:27,650
like a fucking snake like is on the
outside and boom he's in and he's in

2178
01:40:27,651 --> 01:40:28,910
before you know it.
And these,

2179
01:40:28,911 --> 01:40:33,500
these complicated sort of tricky moves
to try to time and follow.

2180
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,600
Very,
very difficult guy to time.

2181
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:40,610
And a lot of that comes from constant
application of all this movement theory

2182
01:40:40,611 --> 01:40:44,300
and movement training.
And like the more you can move your body

2183
01:40:44,301 --> 01:40:47,030
any way you want,
the more you're going to be able to move

2184
01:40:47,031 --> 01:40:48,740
your body any way you want.
And competition.

2185
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,910
Absolutely.
And you know,

2186
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:54,110
at the end of the day,
like you said at the beginning of this

2187
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:54,910
a,

2188
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:57,850
you can call it Tashi,
Sfg Ido,

2189
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:01,360
as long as the coach,
the coach is in the coaching charge,

2190
01:41:01,370 --> 01:41:02,203
it really smart.

2191
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:05,540
They understand how to map you down.
That's good.

2192
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,530
Yeah.
And in the Alamo that curse on,

2193
01:41:07,730 --> 01:41:10,880
we're talking about what he's into his
all plyometrics man.

2194
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:13,160
He barely has these guys lifting
weights.

2195
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:17,660
He's got guys jumping over hurdles and
stuff and doing all these leap,

2196
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:20,870
leaping back and forth and back and
forth and back and forth like he's all

2197
01:41:20,871 --> 01:41:24,620
about movement and in a plyometric way,
in an explosive way.

2198
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:28,100
And that's one of the reasons why he
gets such great results out of his

2199
01:41:28,101 --> 01:41:31,310
fighters is because they,
they developed this extraordinary

2200
01:41:31,311 --> 01:41:34,520
ability to close the distance,
extraordinary ability to get out of the

2201
01:41:34,521 --> 01:41:35,400
way,
you know,

2202
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:38,330
the ability to move and then to stop
what you're doing.

2203
01:41:38,331 --> 01:41:40,130
And then counter quickly,
you know,

2204
01:41:40,131 --> 01:41:45,131
all that stuff is just so giant cross
fit fit into everything we're discussing

2205
01:41:45,381 --> 01:41:50,381
right now because every studio city is
the fucking capital crossfit might know

2206
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:55,750
you can't go anywhere in studio city
without seeing five guys my age rather

2207
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:58,310
than down the street with a 50 pound
plate over the head.

2208
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:01,040
And I'm sitting there going,
something's not right here.

2209
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:02,420
What do you think

2210
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:04,320
I've done in my what I think,
you know,

2211
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:08,470
I think crossfit at the beginning as
brilliant idea,

2212
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:11,780
it was bringing back a lot of things.
They were disappearing like Olympic

2213
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:15,730
weightlifting and gymnastic and stuff.
So I think it was good.

2214
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:20,800
You started to ruin the things when the
games came is when this become a really

2215
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:23,680
an official sport and people that just
get crazy,

2216
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:24,850
you know,
it's a competition.

2217
01:42:24,851 --> 01:42:28,060
So they just training with that goal.
I need to beat the time,

2218
01:42:28,061 --> 01:42:30,370
I need to be depth things and they don't
understand,

2219
01:42:30,371 --> 01:42:33,250
you know,
this is going to kill you at that speed,

2220
01:42:33,251 --> 01:42:34,570
that,
that timing.

2221
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:36,680
It's going to be too much.
Yeah.

2222
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:41,050
But it needs 10.
Those ligaments and muscles at times to

2223
01:42:41,051 --> 01:42:43,110
adopt,
and if you take an hour,

2224
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:47,020
a weightlifter,
he spent an entire life to do devcon to

2225
01:42:47,021 --> 01:42:49,000
learn that kind of moment perfectly.

2226
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:51,190
Never,
never screw the movement and how many

2227
01:42:51,191 --> 01:42:55,060
reps he does in his competition.
One can die.

2228
01:42:55,061 --> 01:42:58,960
He can do that kind of a movement so
fast,

2229
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:00,640
you know,
even if you lose the weight because you

2230
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:04,240
can control one to three reps,
then you might be using app.

2231
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:08,080
I was talking to Michael.
Michael was one of the most successful

2232
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:11,440
crossfit coach,
especially here in southern California.

2233
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:16,800
He used to have on as a big crossfit gym
and in vanize so and it was telling me

2234
01:43:18,151 --> 01:43:19,960
about he has more experience with me.
Of course.

2235
01:43:19,961 --> 01:43:21,430
Cross with that was his business told
me,

2236
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:26,600
I believe that if you do,
you do when you are 20 years old or

2237
01:43:26,601 --> 01:43:29,890
something like this into the 30,
you can speak a little bit.

2238
01:43:29,891 --> 01:43:32,580
Then if you are smart enough,
you understand that,

2239
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:37,390
then you need to slow down.
If you train cross without thinking cap

2240
01:43:37,391 --> 01:43:40,720
time,
try to see online how much this guy did.

2241
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:44,370
So I want to beat this guy and just
training smartly.

2242
01:43:44,371 --> 01:43:48,680
You do your weight lifting your rings
and when it's got to be good it's going

2243
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:53,240
to be,
but if you just to as a sport is just

2244
01:43:53,241 --> 01:43:55,760
conditioning you for that part such as
crossfit.

2245
01:43:55,790 --> 01:44:00,790
You can conditioning Fujitsu,
try to do at crossfit would with a cap

2246
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:03,850
time because like you say,
you're going to be destroyed saying cup

2247
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:04,790
time.
What does that mean?

2248
01:44:05,010 --> 01:44:06,560
Now in our captain is like,
okay,

2249
01:44:06,561 --> 01:44:10,970
you're supposed to do this and let's say
word Wod,

2250
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,360
workout of the day,
kind of the entertainers.

2251
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,010
Let's say you're supposed to finish in
30 minutes.

2252
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,630
Really?
You made me,

2253
01:44:17,631 --> 01:44:19,390
for me,
it take 25 minutes,

2254
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:24,410
about 25 minutes because I know that I
can control my movement and not going to

2255
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:27,740
get an injury,
but most of the people they go online

2256
01:44:27,741 --> 01:44:32,120
because now there's want to see how much
time and it was telling me is crazy.

2257
01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:35,270
They need to rebuild the site,
the website,

2258
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:37,310
and put more,
more,

2259
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:40,910
more power because people,
they go when they wake up in the

2260
01:44:40,911 --> 01:44:41,571
morning,
you're going to see,

2261
01:44:41,571 --> 01:44:43,900
okay,
what is the word of the day this time?

2262
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,690
Then when they go,
they go to work,

2263
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,200
they're going to go online again and
see,

2264
01:44:48,201 --> 01:44:50,800
okay,
east coast is already probably did all

2265
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:52,460
right.
That's the average time.

2266
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,110
Alright,
so I'm going back the time and I

2267
01:44:54,111 --> 01:44:55,820
finished work.
They go online again to see,

2268
01:44:55,821 --> 01:44:57,190
okay,
now east coast,

2269
01:44:57,590 --> 01:45:02,390
this time now I go to the gym,
I try to do and put my time in the day.

2270
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:05,090
In the evening I go like to see if
someone beat me.

2271
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,970
So they go into this loop thing that
they want to compete,

2272
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:09,920
compete,
compete for time,

2273
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:11,720
and you're going to kill yourself.

2274
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:13,940
Well,
Steve Maxwell said that he believes that

2275
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:18,050
when you're doing is when you're lifting
and you're doing these Olympic lifts,

2276
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:22,580
you should be doing a live make lefts to
get you stronger for another sport,

2277
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:25,010
for a competition.
He doesn't believe that it should be a

2278
01:45:25,011 --> 01:45:26,500
sport in itself.
Right.

2279
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:30,440
And he also said that I don't,
he doesn't believe in Olympic lifts for

2280
01:45:30,441 --> 01:45:32,150
high repetition.
He's like,

2281
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:34,410
you're.
It's just a recipe for injury because if

2282
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:36,770
you're doing cleans and presses,
he goes,

2283
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:38,990
you watch Olympic lifters,
they do one wrap,

2284
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:39,990
right?
Yeah.

2285
01:45:39,990 --> 01:45:43,280
They're not doing it 30 times in a row
and you know it.

2286
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,390
Can it be done?
Yes.

2287
01:45:44,391 --> 01:45:47,120
You know what else can happen?
You could drop that weight on your head

2288
01:45:47,121 --> 01:45:49,480
and die because your body's failing
because you're,

2289
01:45:49,481 --> 01:45:51,350
you know,
you did 14 reps and everybody's going,

2290
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,750
come on,
come on Alberto.

2291
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:58,640
One morning
and your arms just literally give out.

2292
01:45:58,641 --> 01:46:00,790
And that thing paralyzes you.
That has happened.

2293
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:03,080
It has happened.

2294
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:04,423
It's about,
like you're saying,

2295
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:07,520
it's the sport.
So if you want to do a game show

2296
01:46:07,521 --> 01:46:09,020
competition,
you need to train that way,

2297
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:09,960
need.

2298
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,940
Well there's guys that can do it.
And they do do it.

2299
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:14,310
You know,
there's those rich froning guy that has

2300
01:46:14,311 --> 01:46:18,210
the winds that every year there's guys
that can do it and they do do it.

2301
01:46:18,211 --> 01:46:19,950
But you,
the person who's listening to this,

2302
01:46:19,951 --> 01:46:23,400
the average human being,
you are way better off following like a

2303
01:46:23,401 --> 01:46:25,770
strong first method,
you know,

2304
01:46:25,771 --> 01:46:29,200
or like your method or Pavle teaches
where you're,

2305
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:30,070
you know,
you,

2306
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:32,280
you lift the weights,
but you don't go to failure.

2307
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:35,370
Use great technique.
And if you want to get endurance,

2308
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,650
run up a fucking hill.
Okay,

2309
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:40,080
go do rounds on a heavy bag.
You want endurance,

2310
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:41,880
do sprints and a heavy bag.
You know what I do?

2311
01:46:41,881 --> 01:46:46,881
I have a timer and it times,
etc. For three minutes and every 30

2312
01:46:47,521 --> 01:46:51,240
seconds a buzzer goes off.
So there's a bell and then every 30

2313
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:52,080
seconds is a buzzer.

2314
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:54,840
And when those 30 seconds hit eat
Fucking sprint.

2315
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:57,090
So it's 30 seconds,
boom,

2316
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,160
boom,
boom,

2317
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:01,830
boom.
Just go fucking crazy for 30 seconds and

2318
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:05,110
the next buzzer hits.
So the next 30 seconds is so light and

2319
01:47:05,190 --> 01:47:07,670
the next 30 seconds I'm just sorta going
through the motions.

2320
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:09,060
I'm kicking and punching,
but,

2321
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:11,940
and I'm waiting for that fucking buzzer
and that buzzer goes off.

2322
01:47:11,941 --> 01:47:14,070
And then I go off again.
They just do that.

2323
01:47:14,071 --> 01:47:17,010
If you want endurance,
that'll give you phenomenal endurance,

2324
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:21,990
but strength I am of the opinion,
and this is just from the last few years

2325
01:47:21,991 --> 01:47:25,980
of me operating this way,
that you should do low repetitions and

2326
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:26,970
he should do it more often.

2327
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:28,320
Absolutely.
I agree with you.

2328
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:29,780
That's what I do for me.
And I got better.

2329
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:32,270
I got stronger than before and I,
and I,

2330
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:37,080
I took my hormone truck,
trucker and understand I took my

2331
01:47:37,081 --> 01:47:41,640
cortisol level test and a lower lower
just to train like that.

2332
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:45,540
Your stress lower wraps?
No,

2333
01:47:45,541 --> 01:47:46,230
no.

2334
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:48,660
How do you schedule your own personal
workouts?

2335
01:47:48,661 --> 01:47:50,790
Do you,
do you have someone do it for you or do

2336
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:52,830
you decide based on how your body's
feeling,

2337
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:53,700
do,
uh,

2338
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:56,340
do to myself.
I did to myself and it's dependable.

2339
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:01,400
I have my schedule about a much driving.
I need to cover a specific topic,

2340
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:03,540
a lot of traveling,
talking about that,

2341
01:48:03,541 --> 01:48:06,660
that's an issue.
For example,

2342
01:48:06,661 --> 01:48:10,500
just for january,
from january 10 now I've been in

2343
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:16,020
Australia and being back in Italy.
Then I went back to Brazil,

2344
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:17,520
Brazil,
back to Italy,

2345
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:18,301
Italy,
Panama,

2346
01:48:18,301 --> 01:48:19,170
Panama,
Mexico,

2347
01:48:19,171 --> 01:48:19,821
Mexico.
Yet.

2348
01:48:19,821 --> 01:48:21,750
Then I go back to it and then I go back
to Korea.

2349
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,600
Oh jesus,
it's happening this week.

2350
01:48:24,601 --> 01:48:27,240
I'm here next week.
I'm in maybe new in Australia.

2351
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:30,450
And so it's crazy for me.
That's why I really very careful about

2352
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:33,960
the way they're trained and sleep too.
I bet.

2353
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:35,760
Right.
fucks with your sleep and all that

2354
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:39,090
traveling.
So then like I was telling joy,

2355
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:40,410
uh,
used a lot of melatonin,

2356
01:48:40,411 --> 01:48:41,640
of course,
melatonin,

2357
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:45,870
phosphatidylserine to reduce my cortisol
level,

2358
01:48:45,871 --> 01:48:48,510
you know,
try to try to plan,

2359
01:48:48,511 --> 01:48:50,130
okay,
I'm going to land in this place.

2360
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:55,020
The time zone iS different and try to
adjust my meals or the time zone,

2361
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:57,990
you know,
tied to my training so I can set up.

2362
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:03,860
It's pretty complicated for me to stay
in decent shape and debrief vitamins

2363
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:05,273
with you.
Yeah,

2364
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:09,120
I guess I got vitamin c and vitamin d
and he a lot.

2365
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:13,620
And uh.
What about like as far as your diet,

2366
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:15,960
like what do you concentrate on?
do you concentrate on eating a lot of

2367
01:49:15,961 --> 01:49:20,370
vegetables?
I actually try super green on

2368
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:23,670
greg because you take it with you.

2369
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:31,740
I don't like greens
someplace you go.

2370
01:49:31,741 --> 01:49:33,630
It's crazy.
Didn't you ask for veggies,

2371
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:34,960
they all the things that gave you?
Yeah,

2372
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:40,360
it's a couple of things that's easy for
me to put it in my shake or whatever.

2373
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:43,560
Water,
vegetables,

2374
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:44,580
so god damn.
Okay,

2375
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,900
so important for people and so many
people,

2376
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,010
they don't have it in

2377
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,280
their diet.
They mess up and your body just does not

2378
01:49:51,281 --> 01:49:53,770
have those nutrients and it starts
drawing them out of your body.

2379
01:49:53,771 --> 01:49:56,890
It takes it out of your bones.
It takes out of your muscle and also

2380
01:49:56,891 --> 01:50:00,460
you're just not recovering correctly.
You're not developing correctly.

2381
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:01,990
What do you get your produce?
Trauma.

2382
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:03,490
I mean,
that's the dumbest question.

2383
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:06,040
Tomatoes don't taste like tomatoes no
more,

2384
01:50:06,041 --> 01:50:06,611
joe.
Well,

2385
01:50:06,611 --> 01:50:09,700
that's because the tomatoes that you get
in the grocery stores are designed to

2386
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:11,440
last longer.
They're not designed to taste good.

2387
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:12,320
Oh,
but I could if you

2388
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:16,930
do as much as I got up yesterday,
early one kind of forum.

2389
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:21,130
I try as much as I can mean I can't.
I crave tomatoes,

2390
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:22,830
heirloom tomatoes,
joy,

2391
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:24,370
they look ugly.
They taste amazing.

2392
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,021
No,
I got it.

2393
01:50:25,021 --> 01:50:27,040
They only last like a few days.
A few days ago.

2394
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:28,960
That's the problem because they're real
tomatoes,

2395
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:30,910
they're not these fucking franken
tomatoes,

2396
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:33,640
tomatoes.

2397
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:36,360
They're hard and they're pale.
It cut into them like,

2398
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:39,160
what is this a tomato or is this an app?
Like,

2399
01:50:39,161 --> 01:50:42,610
what the fuck is this?
It's weird and you know that they only

2400
01:50:42,611 --> 01:50:45,490
do it so that they could keep them on
those trucks longer and drive around the

2401
01:50:45,491 --> 01:50:49,260
country with them and keep them on the
shelves and the grocery store produce

2402
01:50:49,261 --> 01:50:50,094
yet.
Yeah,

2403
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:51,890
we grow our own vegetables,
tomatoes,

2404
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:54,070
we grow tomatoes,
we grow kale,

2405
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:57,280
squash,
we grow cucumbers.

2406
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:59,650
We grow a lot of things.
Yeah.

2407
01:50:59,651 --> 01:51:00,460
I think,
um,

2408
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:01,570
if you can,
you should do it.

2409
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:04,720
It's,
it's very satisfying to make a salad out

2410
01:51:04,721 --> 01:51:07,540
of something that you grew yourself and
just super healthy,

2411
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:08,440
you know,
where it came from,

2412
01:51:08,830 --> 01:51:11,020
you know,
we buy real healthy fertilizer,

2413
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,880
good soil,
you know,

2414
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:15,370
and I think good soil is really
important to.

2415
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:17,110
Um,
I hAve a friend who lived in brooklyn

2416
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:18,700
and he got a soil tested.

2417
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,440
It turned out that the ground was
contaminated with lead from back when

2418
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:26,560
they used to have lead gasoline when
they had leaded gasoline.

2419
01:51:26,770 --> 01:51:29,230
Like all that shit goes up in the air
and it all comes down,

2420
01:51:29,231 --> 01:51:33,190
it's in your soil and it was in his soil
and there's different plants that you

2421
01:51:33,191 --> 01:51:36,010
could plant that will draw it out of the
soil.

2422
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:40,420
Or the best solution I think is if you
have a yard,

2423
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:45,480
just get potted plants,
just get those big wooden boxes and grow

2424
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:48,310
the plants in there.
That's the best way because then you can

2425
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:50,890
completely control what soil they grow
in.

2426
01:51:50,891 --> 01:51:51,641
And then,
you know,

2427
01:51:51,641 --> 01:51:53,560
it's,
it's just a very contained environment.

2428
01:51:53,561 --> 01:51:57,160
So that's how we do it.
We have these big potters and you know,

2429
01:51:57,161 --> 01:52:00,160
we grow watermelons and all kinds of
course,

2430
01:52:00,161 --> 01:52:04,190
because that would be my world to become
an old italian man.

2431
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:08,720
Roll up your pants,
get a synagogue and oh,

2432
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:11,650
I'd love it.
I love it right now.

2433
01:52:11,730 --> 01:52:14,050
Over right now everything's so green out
here.

2434
01:52:14,051 --> 01:52:15,310
It's so amazing.
Beautiful.

2435
01:52:15,311 --> 01:52:18,430
Because it's amazing.
It's amazing.

2436
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:22,030
He's been around in there like crazy.
Yeah.

2437
01:52:22,031 --> 01:52:25,270
We had a drought for five years and then
this year it's just been flooded.

2438
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:27,850
They had a giant break of a dam in
sacramento.

2439
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:28,830
Oh yeah,
that's true.

2440
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:31,660
I was in Panama.
What happened?

2441
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:33,370
Yeah,
it's fucking awesome.

2442
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:35,680
Awesome.
There's this thing called the glory

2443
01:52:35,681 --> 01:52:37,870
hole.
The morning glory hole up northern

2444
01:52:37,871 --> 01:52:40,480
California.
It'S this crazy hole that's in this lake

2445
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:45,930
and it hadn't operated in 10 years.
It hadn't been doing it because it's

2446
01:52:46,251 --> 01:52:48,260
like this,
like a vortex,

2447
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:50,690
like a,
what do they call those when it spins

2448
01:52:50,691 --> 01:52:51,640
like that?
What do they call it?

2449
01:52:51,730 --> 01:52:55,520
A textbook.
So it's sucks this whole somehow or

2450
01:52:55,521 --> 01:52:57,860
another when the water level gets to a
certain point,

2451
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:59,390
it develops as whole.

2452
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:03,140
And this lake and it wasn't there for 10
years and now it's finally back again

2453
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:05,570
for the first time.
Oh yeah,

2454
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:07,460
there it is.
Isn't that nuts?

2455
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,120
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2456
01:53:09,170 --> 01:53:12,440
So for 10 years the water level wasn't
high enough for that actually to be

2457
01:53:12,441 --> 01:53:14,160
happening and now it's finally happening
again.

2458
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:18,380
People were all excited,
so it's pretty much over all of the.

2459
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:22,700
The drought issues that we had here in
California are pretty much all tell this

2460
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:26,540
fucking guy,
I don't care what tv they get this get

2461
01:53:26,541 --> 01:53:29,210
rid of this god that we were waiting on
this other tv for so long.

2462
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,530
Tell him today,
say,

2463
01:53:30,531 --> 01:53:34,160
just get whatever the fuck you can get
by saturday because we have a fight

2464
01:53:34,161 --> 01:53:36,260
companion on saturday.
We can't have this happening.

2465
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,780
Um,
but anyway.

2466
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:41,480
Yeah.
So you take a protein protein?

2467
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:42,560
Honestly,
no,

2468
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:48,140
I very rarely to protein if I have to,
like if I'm running and I'm low on food,

2469
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:51,470
I haven't eaten anything but I know I'm
going to work out.

2470
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:54,080
Um,
I like hemp protein because I can take

2471
01:53:54,081 --> 01:53:57,680
like a glass of hemp protein with
coconut water and I could,

2472
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:01,580
I could work out in 30 minutes,
like no problem because it digests so

2473
01:54:01,581 --> 01:54:03,930
easily.
It's Just goes right into your system.

2474
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:05,600
So easy.
It's a nice light.

2475
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:06,500
It's only,
you know,

2476
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,410
you're only dealing like 16 grams of
protein.

2477
01:54:08,411 --> 01:54:11,960
It's nothing too crazy.
But most of my protein I get from meat

2478
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:14,720
or real food.
That's what we were discussing in the

2479
01:54:14,721 --> 01:54:15,590
car.
Yeah,

2480
01:54:15,690 --> 01:54:19,190
I do.
If I'm on the plane and I didn't get the

2481
01:54:19,191 --> 01:54:20,840
chance to cook my food and things of the
plane,

2482
01:54:20,841 --> 01:54:22,010
man,
I got some product.

2483
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:24,890
But otherwise I like to get some old
food.

2484
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,400
If I knew I was traveling and I couldn't
get it,

2485
01:54:28,401 --> 01:54:30,530
I bring a lot of bars with me.
I bring these,

2486
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:33,380
um,
there's a company called primal kitchen.

2487
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:36,020
This guy mark sisson,
and he makes these.

2488
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:38,420
Yeah,
he makes these amazing bars because

2489
01:54:38,421 --> 01:54:40,820
they're very low sugar.
So when I called five grants sugar.

2490
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:42,980
Yup.
He's got the coconut.

2491
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:45,290
He's got um,
cashews and coconuts.

2492
01:54:45,291 --> 01:54:48,940
He's got almonds and dark chocolate.
This is there some back therapy,

2493
01:54:48,990 --> 01:54:51,620
more trouble by god.
He's got a coconut

2494
01:54:53,230 --> 01:54:55,340
dog.
He's got a vanilla coconut meal

2495
01:54:55,341 --> 01:54:57,200
replacement.
Oh yeah.

2496
01:54:57,230 --> 01:55:01,160
It's very good.
I could drink this at seven in the

2497
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:05,660
morning.
Me smoke and eat till two.

2498
01:55:06,530 --> 01:55:11,530
I don't need to have to jujitsu a drink.
That protein powder because I mixed them

2499
01:55:12,081 --> 01:55:13,090
up.
I used to have,

2500
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:15,290
I use that,
like if I have a long,

2501
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:18,540
like today I drank the cocoa because I'm
not going to be out of here till two.

2502
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:20,810
You sent me hungry.
You see me fidgeting?

2503
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:22,670
No,
it's the real fucking deal.

2504
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:24,350
The key is low sugar.

2505
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:27,560
That is the key to eliminate as much
sugar in your diet.

2506
01:55:27,561 --> 01:55:28,311
And by the way,
folks,

2507
01:55:28,311 --> 01:55:31,370
that includes fruit juices,
if you thinking that you're drinking a

2508
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:33,350
big glass of orange juice in the morning
and it's healthy.

2509
01:55:33,351 --> 01:55:35,960
So worst thing ever.
It's so crazy.

2510
01:55:35,961 --> 01:55:39,170
We thought that was healthy for so long.
For so long we thought,

2511
01:55:39,171 --> 01:55:40,570
oh,
I'm drinking a nice healthy orange

2512
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:43,080
juice.
Squeezed through that whole scenario.

2513
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:43,981
they may see,
oh,

2514
01:55:43,981 --> 01:55:45,810
we got cereal.
I don't need carbohydrateS.

2515
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:50,430
Sugar.
The more sugar you can cut out of your

2516
01:55:50,431 --> 01:55:51,264
diet,
the better.

2517
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:55,020
And sunday is my cheat day.
Yesterday I had pizza.

2518
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:57,550
I had a cuban sandwich.
I had a q,

2519
01:55:57,570 --> 01:55:59,390
a cuban sandwich that uh,
um,

2520
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:00,980
it was a fucking delicious.
What is,

2521
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:05,800
it wasn't the movie right in the cif
chef?

2522
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:07,860
Yes.
But I didn't see chef.

2523
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:10,630
But what a chef.
They had a cuban restaurant in movies.

2524
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:14,590
That was that movie with bradley cooper.
Is that three people shot?

2525
01:56:15,310 --> 01:56:16,620
Oh,
he makes up a food truck,

2526
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:21,610
a soul food truck.
I love with bradley cooper.

2527
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:23,850
Something else with him now.
No one saw that movie.

2528
01:56:23,851 --> 01:56:26,500
He didn't even see that movie.
Somebody pulled the people that made the

2529
01:56:26,501 --> 01:56:28,230
people that edited that movie fell
asleep.

2530
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:32,060
That's a unique thing on my page.
Joe,

2531
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:36,630
you got to show you.
They put this thing about a restaurant

2532
01:56:36,631 --> 01:56:38,760
in New York city.
It's called.

2533
01:56:38,761 --> 01:56:40,110
I've been there.
I've been there.

2534
01:56:40,530 --> 01:56:43,560
It's called like golly,
that is the last cuban chinese

2535
01:56:43,561 --> 01:56:47,070
restaurant and really excited states,

2536
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:47,910
Joe,

2537
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:52,910
They have one last and his name is
antonio wong and the guy joe,

2538
01:56:53,491 --> 01:56:55,050
you got to put the thing.
I'm pleased.

2539
01:56:55,051 --> 01:56:57,910
So there's a.
there's a chinese community is huge.

2540
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:02,640
The biggest chinatown before fidel
chinatown on the outlets outside of

2541
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:05,050
China,
but the people that were born there

2542
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:06,660
started talking chinese in Cuba.

2543
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:08,820
So when I was growing up you had like,
I'm fine.

2544
01:57:08,821 --> 01:57:12,420
I cina which is the chinese bell on 57th
and bergen line,

2545
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:17,720
but the real deal one was this last one
called lacan either and yet somebody put

2546
01:57:17,731 --> 01:57:21,120
it on my page yesterday and we will
watch look at this,

2547
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:27,670
but they have.
So they have a chinese eco bada

2548
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:29,580
[inaudible] yo yo,
yo.

2549
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:30,061
Yo.
Yo.

2550
01:57:30,061 --> 01:57:33,660
Yo means what?
They look at it fried bananas,

2551
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:37,020
fried rice.
This is in New York?

2552
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:38,490
Yeah.
See if you can find the video.

2553
01:57:38,491 --> 01:57:40,140
Jim,
and they put it on my facebook page.

2554
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:44,490
We need to go next time.
We're in New York and we do all the

2555
01:57:44,491 --> 01:57:45,410
time.
When he was in New York,

2556
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:48,480
they're open killed too,
but the restaurant already,

2557
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:50,280
by the way.
You have Vietnam?

2558
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:51,570
Yeah,
it was in Vietnam.

2559
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:54,070
They got photos of him,
but before that I met him on the fucking

2560
01:57:54,090 --> 01:57:55,980
beach somewhere before that he was
entitled.

2561
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,670
That was a month ago.
He can't be somewhere else.

2562
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,190
Can anImal.
He's crazy.

2563
01:57:59,191 --> 01:58:01,890
His phone still off the hook.
He was supposed to be back a month ago

2564
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,350
that nobody knows where he is.
He's not coming back until may.

2565
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:07,650
May.
May is one of the shoot.

2566
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:09,210
The shoot,
is that what he said?

2567
01:58:09,211 --> 01:58:10,890
He's not coming back to a man.
I don't.

2568
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:11,820
I don't think.
I don't.

2569
01:58:11,821 --> 01:58:14,880
I don't think we'll see him next month
or even hear from him next month.

2570
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:20,360
What a weirdo could you do that could
you vanished for months and just not

2571
01:58:20,431 --> 01:58:21,730
talk to anybody?
None of this.

2572
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:24,360
He's not talking to any of his best
friends were his best friends.

2573
01:58:24,361 --> 01:58:26,460
He's not talking to us.
Not talking to anybody.

2574
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:29,160
Maybe talking like one dude.
Maybe he's got a confidant

2575
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:32,430
when duty calls up.
Hey man,

2576
01:58:32,970 --> 01:58:35,320
I'm only calling you see gabriel
iglesias.

2577
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:36,360
Cool.
What?

2578
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,790
What's he doing?
Canceled this tour.

2579
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:39,590
What?
Why?

2580
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:42,380
Okay.
This tool.

2581
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:44,090
But why do you cancel?
Was trying to use.

2582
01:58:45,010 --> 01:58:48,490
Looked at a headshot of myself.
Ten years passed by don.

2583
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:51,390
That's what he said.
So how about damon apolis app apple.

2584
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:53,710
this manager looked at me and said talk
sense into him police.

2585
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:55,620
But what dId he say?
What?

2586
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:56,980
What?
What's this thought process?

2587
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:58,600
Just working too much.
He worked.

2588
01:58:58,610 --> 01:59:01,330
He needs to.
He's joined a boxing class.

2589
01:59:01,331 --> 01:59:05,080
He joined solstice classes.
Really just wants to live.

2590
01:59:05,250 --> 01:59:07,810
She just wants to live.
They bought that new mustang.

2591
01:59:07,811 --> 01:59:09,340
Joe.
That that's a bad motherfucker.

2592
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,650
Which one?
Which one did you go to?

2593
01:59:10,651 --> 01:59:12,520
The one that they made 77 of them.
Oh,

2594
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:14,250
the shelby gt.
Three 50.

2595
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:17,440
How many horsepower?
Pretty high.

2596
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:19,780
It's just too much shit that you don't
really need.

2597
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,900
They only made 77 of them,
so he's going to go,

2598
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:27,280
I'm writing this fucking cars and he's
got a shit load of money.

2599
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:30,090
Gabriel,
he's got a shit load of cars so he's

2600
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:33,930
wants to do something with jay and
they're got to drive cars and wave at

2601
01:59:33,931 --> 01:59:36,380
people,
goes out the window.

2602
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:40,030
You know,
I've been thinking about this myself,

2603
01:59:40,031 --> 01:59:42,610
man,
because of my ufc contract is going to

2604
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:43,700
be up again.
Uh,

2605
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:45,670
I only have,
I do it one year at a time now.

2606
01:59:45,671 --> 01:59:48,340
I used to sign these long ass contracts,
like five years,

2607
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:50,590
but now I'm like,
I'm not doing that anymore.

2608
01:59:50,591 --> 01:59:55,480
I'm going year by year and I have to
decide soon because my contract's up

2609
01:59:55,481 --> 01:59:57,010
again in august.
I don't know what I'm going to do,

2610
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:58,990
but I do too many things.
I do too much.

2611
01:59:59,050 --> 02:00:00,700
I work too much,
you know,

2612
02:00:01,370 --> 02:00:05,050
and the family really wears on it.
And we were talking about date night on

2613
02:00:05,051 --> 02:00:05,884
fridays.
I got,

2614
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:09,910
I got the bill of lading sent that once
they give you the bill of lading that

2615
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:14,911
makes sense over the,
the act of the act of 2017 that the dea

2616
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:17,740
is household friday night.

2617
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:20,740
His wives dog give a fuck about you.
Stand up no more.

2618
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:22,780
I gotta get out here.
I got a four year old that drives me

2619
02:00:22,781 --> 02:00:24,160
crazy.
So friday night's date,

2620
02:00:24,161 --> 02:00:26,310
night to official.
You know what man,

2621
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:27,700
you and I have been talking about this
too,

2622
02:00:27,730 --> 02:00:32,350
that in town it's maybe sometimes even
best to not go out on the weekends and

2623
02:00:32,351 --> 02:00:35,470
work because even though it's good to
work and it's good to like get your

2624
02:00:35,471 --> 02:00:37,810
standup and on the weekends everybody's
there to see the big show.

2625
02:00:37,811 --> 02:00:39,160
Right.
But for us,

2626
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:42,460
especially now for me it's only a couple
months.

2627
02:00:42,461 --> 02:00:45,520
It's my special came out.
And for you it's just a month and a

2628
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:45,761
half.
Right.

2629
02:00:45,761 --> 02:00:47,230
When did your special come out?
Three months ago.

2630
02:00:47,231 --> 02:00:48,064
December,
right?

2631
02:00:48,150 --> 02:00:49,730
Yeah.
So for me it's three months to.

2632
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:51,790
Um,
so when,

2633
02:00:51,791 --> 02:00:54,340
when that happens,
or four months when that happens,

2634
02:00:54,341 --> 02:00:57,490
your shit comes out and then you're in
this scramble mode where you're trying

2635
02:00:57,491 --> 02:00:58,324
to create.

2636
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,790
And what I like,
what you're doing is you're going to

2637
02:01:00,791 --> 02:01:04,600
these hole in the walls,
goes weird places and show up and work

2638
02:01:04,601 --> 02:01:06,100
your material out.
And these joints,

2639
02:01:06,370 --> 02:01:08,200
you go to the comedy store on a friday
night,

2640
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:11,950
there's 400 fucking people.
It's packed to the gills and everybody's

2641
02:01:11,951 --> 02:01:14,290
doing their best 15 minutes over and
over and over again.

2642
02:01:14,291 --> 02:01:16,140
And one of the things that I noticed
when I went there recently,

2643
02:01:16,630 --> 02:01:19,570
a lot of these guys that aren't doing a
specials,

2644
02:01:19,730 --> 02:01:21,520
you know,
there's a lot of young guys coming up in

2645
02:01:21,521 --> 02:01:23,890
particular that they don't have any
specials.

2646
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:26,280
They,
they're not releasing any materials.

2647
02:01:26,281 --> 02:01:28,600
So they're doing the same material every
time.

2648
02:01:28,601 --> 02:01:32,310
I see them for fucking years now,
for two years when I've been coming

2649
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:34,150
there.
There's certain comedians that have been

2650
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:36,790
doing the same act every time I work
with them.

2651
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:41,120
So what they're doing is they're
tightening up this hard 15 minutes and

2652
02:01:41,121 --> 02:01:41,870
they're doing it all the time.

2653
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:45,290
And you know how to do that 15 minutes.
I don't think that's helping you.

2654
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:48,200
And I don't think it's a lot of ways is
not helping me.

2655
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:49,450
They're like,
what would really help?

2656
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:53,840
Because you do long sets on the road.
If you go somewhere and you're doing an

2657
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,580
hour and you do have two shows on a
friday,

2658
02:01:55,581 --> 02:01:57,650
two shows on a saturday,
that's what helps.

2659
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:02,060
That's where it's at.
It's a the podcast.

2660
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:06,110
Because just the way my office building
is,

2661
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:08,360
I don't,
I can't go in there in the daytime and

2662
02:02:08,361 --> 02:02:10,670
smoke a pound in the pot and played loud
music.

2663
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:13,070
I just can't do it.
And I don't want to do it.

2664
02:02:13,071 --> 02:02:16,310
So I prefer to do it at night when I'm
going to have a gun to my head.

2665
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:18,710
You know,
if I come here at 1:00,

2666
02:02:18,711 --> 02:02:20,390
joe,
and we have to sit here till four,

2667
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:22,640
from three to four,
I'm going to be fidgety or out of

2668
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:24,920
control because I'm thinking about that
fucking traffic.

2669
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:27,620
I want you to do podcast.
I don't want you to think of nothing.

2670
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:28,910
I don't want you to think of nothing,
bro.

2671
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:32,150
If you got a spot,
don't do my podcast because we might go

2672
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:33,590
on a tangent.
That's brilliant.

2673
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:35,060
Yeah,
and you got to leave for a stupid

2674
02:02:35,061 --> 02:02:36,050
fucking spot.
I've no,

2675
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:39,440
don't do it that monday.
Then I tried to do comedy two,

2676
02:02:39,441 --> 02:02:41,120
three times a week,
but now I'm doubling up.

2677
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,580
What do you do?
You have a guest this wednesday

2678
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:48,440
for your podcast?
Because I was supposed to do it.

2679
02:02:48,441 --> 02:02:49,700
I'm supposed to do at one of these
times.

2680
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:53,740
We'll figure it out.
Tell me one so I could cancel whatever

2681
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:54,660
comedy I got you.
Yeah.

2682
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:57,250
What days are you doing it?
Mondays and wednesdays.

2683
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,910
So you got tonight?
No,

2684
02:02:58,911 --> 02:03:00,170
I'm not doing it tonight.
How come?

2685
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,180
Because I did it last night.
Uh,

2686
02:03:02,181 --> 02:03:03,290
I did two yesterday.

2687
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,420
Oh nice.
Nice.

2688
02:03:04,421 --> 02:03:06,590
Did the undercover cop finally.
Oh,

2689
02:03:06,591 --> 02:03:11,591
how was that joe fucking to be close to
a killer for 18 months.

2690
02:03:11,901 --> 02:03:15,560
We sprays sinai and your face.
That's what he was doing.

2691
02:03:15,561 --> 02:03:17,240
He was chasing this guy that was the ice
man,

2692
02:03:17,241 --> 02:03:18,500
right?
He was chasing the ice man.

2693
02:03:18,501 --> 02:03:22,880
So he had a medium and the iceman for
the only reason why the ice made contact

2694
02:03:22,881 --> 02:03:25,620
with him was because he heard he could
get different guns and you know,

2695
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:28,770
he was atf.
So when the ice man contacts me,

2696
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:32,840
he wanted sinai.
So he kept saying bring me the sinai and

2697
02:03:32,841 --> 02:03:36,890
then he was going to sell him arms.
So for 18 months this guy had contact

2698
02:03:36,891 --> 02:03:37,830
with this guy.
I had met him,

2699
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:40,760
meet him at a diner,
he said he would hold his gun,

2700
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:45,260
pointed right at him when he would meet
with him under the table or under the

2701
02:03:45,261 --> 02:03:45,650
table.

2702
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:49,460
But you also had to sit outside.
You always tell them to sit outside

2703
02:03:49,461 --> 02:03:54,461
because he didn't want to be downwind of
the sinai just in case he's because he

2704
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:56,960
just sprayed in your face,
you're done.

2705
02:03:57,110 --> 02:03:59,730
So he was always worrying this guy was
going to ice them,

2706
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:03,170
like literally isom literally.
Wow.

2707
02:04:03,230 --> 02:04:05,480
And then he would kill it.
You call me ice man.

2708
02:04:05,481 --> 02:04:06,890
For people who don't know,
he,

2709
02:04:06,891 --> 02:04:08,870
uh,
would kill somebody and then throw them

2710
02:04:08,871 --> 02:04:12,110
in the freezer in his basement for like
seven,

2711
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:13,880
eight months.
So they disappear.

2712
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:16,520
And then he put them in this fucking
basement and then he would toss the body

2713
02:04:16,521 --> 02:04:19,160
somewhere so it confused the fuck out of
people.

2714
02:04:19,161 --> 02:04:21,560
They didn't know when the guy died
because it would thaw out.

2715
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:23,640
And then they be like,
why is this kind of frostbite on them?

2716
02:04:23,641 --> 02:04:26,030
What the fuck is this guy's intestines?
The fresh?

2717
02:04:26,090 --> 02:04:28,130
Yeah,
like his intestines were still fresh.

2718
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:30,650
Meanwhile the guy had disappeared six
months ago,

2719
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:34,580
so they call them the ice man.
And he kept these fucking people in his

2720
02:04:34,581 --> 02:04:37,560
basement.
You know how cold blooded you have to be

2721
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:38,413
the

2722
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:40,870
you're going to sleep in your basement.
You got to.

2723
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:43,760
Did he do in his basement?
They have a warehouse where he has a

2724
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:46,750
warehouse in north bergen,
New Jersey where I'm from right out

2725
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:49,770
newkirk.
I got my dick sucked out their time by

2726
02:04:49,771 --> 02:04:51,510
gabby.
Right out there.

2727
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:55,320
I saw gabby driving on kennedy boulevard
and I just stopped the and she goes,

2728
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:56,650
what do you need a ride like,
gabby,

2729
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:57,690
can you suck my dick?
She goes,

2730
02:04:57,691 --> 02:05:01,440
get in
good kid.

2731
02:05:01,930 --> 02:05:02,870
And then,
uh,

2732
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:06,420
he killed.
Like is richard kuklinski right?

2733
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,220
He had killed the.
I lived on,

2734
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:13,221
given that terrorists and on charles
court there was a guy named mr.

2735
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:16,140
Softy.
He had an ice cream truck and that was

2736
02:05:16,141 --> 02:05:19,980
his partner until he killed him too.
He killed all his fucking partners.

2737
02:05:20,490 --> 02:05:24,690
He killed a lot of fucking people and he
killed a lot of people for the gambino

2738
02:05:24,691 --> 02:05:25,080
family.

2739
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:26,190
Right.
Wasn't that who?

2740
02:05:26,191 --> 02:05:29,280
He worked for him,
but he was doing shit that it just

2741
02:05:29,281 --> 02:05:31,710
wasn't like.
They asked them one time about he

2742
02:05:31,711 --> 02:05:32,940
bought.
He bought a bow and arrow.

2743
02:05:34,230 --> 02:05:36,660
He bought a bow and arrow,
one of the ones that you have like a gun

2744
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:38,700
across and the guy says,
how do you know what was going to work?

2745
02:05:38,730 --> 02:05:41,620
It was just go for a ride.
There was a guy that light with a

2746
02:05:41,621 --> 02:05:44,220
motorcycle helmet.
He shot him right now,

2747
02:05:44,221 --> 02:05:48,540
man just took off because it works.
He was one of those dudes that just

2748
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:50,370
didn't care and that's what this guy was
saying.

2749
02:05:50,371 --> 02:05:51,204
Yes,
it goes,

2750
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:54,090
you really don't know that this.
He goes,

2751
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:58,950
that one day my kid was halloween and he
had the horns on at the house and I had

2752
02:05:58,951 --> 02:06:02,940
to tell the kit to take them off because
in reality I was sitting across from

2753
02:06:02,941 --> 02:06:06,180
this guy every day this guy would talk
about murder,

2754
02:06:06,181 --> 02:06:08,130
like the way you talk about lifting
weights,

2755
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:10,980
like I shot him in the throat and he
didn't really die.

2756
02:06:10,981 --> 02:06:12,410
So I look at,
you know,

2757
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:15,810
just shit that's just,
you gave me that book,

2758
02:06:15,811 --> 02:06:17,840
murder machine.
You remember that book?

2759
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:23,040
Jesus christ,
that's a fucking scary book and it

2760
02:06:23,041 --> 02:06:26,100
details this guy who was a um,
a mob boss,

2761
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:28,890
was it in the seventies,
in the seventies,

2762
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:33,030
and this,
it details how he slowly started killing

2763
02:06:33,031 --> 02:06:35,760
a bunch of people,
like slowly but surely.

2764
02:06:35,761 --> 02:06:40,080
And then they would cut them up in their
fucking bathtub and then they had this

2765
02:06:40,081 --> 02:06:42,210
one apartment where they would take
these people to,

2766
02:06:42,211 --> 02:06:44,910
that was above this bar that they would
go to.

2767
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:49,140
They take these people upstairs and
fucking kill him and they killed so many

2768
02:06:49,141 --> 02:06:50,130
people.
But you know,

2769
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:54,120
there were animals because it wasn't
even for business anymore.

2770
02:06:55,600 --> 02:07:00,420
It was like he disrespected me like it
would listen to me called my sister fat.

2771
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:02,610
Really?
You gotta walk them upstairs.

2772
02:07:02,611 --> 02:07:05,910
They'd shoot them and stuff and they'd
hang them and they'd cook.

2773
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:08,850
Yeah,
and they'd wait for the body to drain.

2774
02:07:09,410 --> 02:07:09,530
Yeah.

2775
02:07:09,530 --> 02:07:12,630
They would cut the neck and hang them
and so that the blood would drain out of

2776
02:07:12,631 --> 02:07:14,880
it.
Go in and chop them up and put them

2777
02:07:14,881 --> 02:07:17,970
around.
Who does this shit fucking sleep at

2778
02:07:17,971 --> 02:07:19,230
night.
You know what I'm saying?

2779
02:07:19,231 --> 02:07:21,270
I could see somebody calls you a
motherfucking.

2780
02:07:21,271 --> 02:07:22,440
You shoot them.
Shit happens.

2781
02:07:22,441 --> 02:07:26,610
You know somebody owe you $10,000.
Somebody hits your sister with caught,

2782
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:29,760
but the just.
They were just doing shit to prove that

2783
02:07:29,761 --> 02:07:31,410
they were animals.
That's animal shit.

2784
02:07:31,470 --> 02:07:33,810
Well,
I think what happens is you get used to

2785
02:07:33,811 --> 02:07:36,880
doing it just like we were talking about
fighting and the more you fight,

2786
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:40,450
the more you get comfortable with it.
I think there's something that happens

2787
02:07:40,451 --> 02:07:42,840
to people when they kill people.
They get real comfortable with it and

2788
02:07:42,841 --> 02:07:45,010
the more comfortable they get with it,
the easier it is.

2789
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:48,070
And then they start getting a rush out
of doing it and there's also this power

2790
02:07:48,071 --> 02:07:50,820
to know that this guy walking around and
you know,

2791
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:52,510
his wife thinks he's coming home and
you're like,

2792
02:07:52,511 --> 02:07:53,770
you know what,
you're not coming home.

2793
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:59,370
I'm going to just stop this right now.
And that it's almost like they get a

2794
02:07:59,411 --> 02:08:02,680
thrill out of playing god in a lot of
ways.

2795
02:08:02,790 --> 02:08:03,623
You know,
he was,

2796
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:05,110
you know,
I read the,

2797
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:08,740
before I spoke to him,
he told me to read a different book.

2798
02:08:09,070 --> 02:08:10,970
I had read a different book on the ice
man.

2799
02:08:11,470 --> 02:08:13,150
And he told me to read a different book.
And again,

2800
02:08:13,151 --> 02:08:15,820
this was our conversation earlier.
What book did you read?

2801
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:16,840
Uh,
it was,

2802
02:08:17,590 --> 02:08:19,870
it was a different author.
This one was by anthony,

2803
02:08:19,871 --> 02:08:22,890
brutal called the iceman.
The one I had read before,

2804
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:26,770
carl was by a different office.
Something called up and they said he

2805
02:08:26,771 --> 02:08:29,380
had,
he had caught the iceman later when he

2806
02:08:29,381 --> 02:08:32,620
had become more exaggerated,
I killed kennedy because towards,

2807
02:08:32,621 --> 02:08:34,240
do you have any killed everybody.
He was dead when

2808
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:38,740
he found out that he was getting
people's deckard.

2809
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:41,680
So this guy wrote the early,
when it's really weird,

2810
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:43,860
you know,
his dad just beat the shit out of them,

2811
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:45,970
beat the shit out of the mother jersey
city.

2812
02:08:45,990 --> 02:08:47,320
Yeah.
It just made him a monster,

2813
02:08:48,070 --> 02:08:49,810
you know,
there's no depth between jersey city and

2814
02:08:49,811 --> 02:08:51,210
hoboken,
new work,

2815
02:08:51,610 --> 02:08:54,430
same animals.
And he said that there was a kid that

2816
02:08:54,431 --> 02:08:57,490
would always call them polk.
He had to wear the same clothes to

2817
02:08:57,491 --> 02:08:59,950
school every day.
You had no money,

2818
02:08:59,951 --> 02:09:01,480
you know,
and uh,

2819
02:09:01,481 --> 02:09:03,760
the kid caught,
he described his first murder.

2820
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:07,600
You know how he got a stick and waited
for the kid to come home.

2821
02:09:07,630 --> 02:09:09,740
He was 14,
you know,

2822
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:14,410
when you kill somebody at 14.
I thought he killed a guy at a bar with

2823
02:09:14,411 --> 02:09:15,660
a.
I thought he killed a guy,

2824
02:09:15,770 --> 02:09:17,410
strangled him.
That was the member.

2825
02:09:17,411 --> 02:09:19,960
He lit the one guy on fire like he
wants.

2826
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:23,440
But the first guy he got was this young
guy and he wouldn't give his name.

2827
02:09:23,441 --> 02:09:26,800
He beat him up with the two by four.
And he went upstairs and the next

2828
02:09:26,801 --> 02:09:29,650
morning the cops were outside.
He thought he just drew a beating on

2829
02:09:29,651 --> 02:09:32,200
him.
He didn't know he killed him,

2830
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:34,720
so he was scared.
He kept puking and he kept going to

2831
02:09:34,721 --> 02:09:38,590
school and thinking that people would
know and after that that's it.

2832
02:09:38,620 --> 02:09:40,080
Once you get away with it,
it's like a,

2833
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:43,240
what's the taste,
the taste tastes in your mouth.

2834
02:09:43,690 --> 02:09:46,150
And then he started going.
He had an argument with a guy over pool

2835
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:51,910
and he beat him in the head with a pool
cue 30 fucking times and then he got

2836
02:09:51,911 --> 02:09:54,470
into another beef where he shot the guy
outside,

2837
02:09:54,471 --> 02:09:57,090
but we left the car on fire with the
body in it.

2838
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:59,140
You know,
the reason why there's so many

2839
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:00,140
unexplained.

2840
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:04,810
That's because his first couple of years
he was going out at night,

2841
02:10:04,811 --> 02:10:06,730
you know,
there was a time when I had four drinks

2842
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:12,270
and I go rob something you believe that
just the drinks would get you feel

2843
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:14,350
loose.
And like I was great until I had four

2844
02:10:14,351 --> 02:10:16,570
drinks and then I'd be walking home,
let's see,

2845
02:10:16,571 --> 02:10:18,310
a store.
And I kicked the door opening for some

2846
02:10:18,311 --> 02:10:19,330
fucking reason,
you know?

2847
02:10:19,350 --> 02:10:21,340
Wow.
He would go out and kill,

2848
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:24,460
can kill people at night,
like go somewhere and let's see.

2849
02:10:24,461 --> 02:10:26,560
He just insulted them for the weirdest
thing,

2850
02:10:26,590 --> 02:10:26,921
like,
hey,

2851
02:10:26,921 --> 02:10:29,490
get out of the way.
He would wait for you outside and shoot

2852
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:32,100
you.
So that's how he developed his things.

2853
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:34,490
Was that episode available now?
Which one?

2854
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:36,800
The one with this dough.
Put it up yet.

2855
02:10:36,860 --> 02:10:40,960
When is that one going up this week I'm
going to do a wraparound the router,

2856
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,370
because it was a phone call,
right,

2857
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:46,730
so I just take the phone call was sunday
and then we'll do a wrap around and

2858
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:47,810
compare it to the book.

2859
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:50,700
He's a great guy.
I really had a great guy.

2860
02:10:50,701 --> 02:10:53,000
I mean I got to talk to him every day.
He's like 70,

2861
02:10:53,380 --> 02:10:55,970
but he's essex county.
Went to the university of Nebraska,

2862
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:59,060
was a golden gloves champion,
went back,

2863
02:10:59,061 --> 02:11:01,490
became a state cop,
then they became atf.

2864
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:05,000
Just a fucking great story.
There was two guys that were talking

2865
02:11:05,001 --> 02:11:06,830
about your podcast.
It was fucking hilarious.

2866
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,040
They were talking about lee lee,
cya,

2867
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:11,540
and they were like,
what joey has done to that poor guy,

2868
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:14,030
and he's like,
every time he sees him he's forcing them

2869
02:11:14,031 --> 02:11:16,130
to eat mushrooms.
He's got to take asset.

2870
02:11:16,131 --> 02:11:18,680
He's given them pot.
He's given them edibles.

2871
02:11:18,681 --> 02:11:23,060
He's lied to them about the dosage.
Lead.

2872
02:11:23,110 --> 02:11:24,860
Loves it.
He loves it.

2873
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:26,870
He does.
He did the.

2874
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:30,150
We did that liquid acid with the ice
cube with the sugar cubes.

2875
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:32,810
Jesus christ.
But two weeks ago we did two nights in a

2876
02:11:32,811 --> 02:11:34,490
row.
Was hilarious on the show.

2877
02:11:34,491 --> 02:11:36,020
He did it and then he called me the next
day.

2878
02:11:36,021 --> 02:11:36,920
He's like,
that was fun.

2879
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:42,620
I went to cps at four in the morning.
He wasn't like that before he met you

2880
02:11:42,621 --> 02:11:43,310
though?
No,

2881
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:45,680
but he's having a great to turn that kid
into a freak.

2882
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:49,640
He's not a freak man.
I turned them into a functioning savage,

2883
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:54,590
but I love him.
Like I love him with all my heart

2884
02:11:54,591 --> 02:11:57,890
because he makes me.
He makes me laugh so much joe.

2885
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:59,090
Like he just,
you know,

2886
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:00,950
I'm 54.
It's 28.

2887
02:12:00,951 --> 02:12:02,720
He's half my age.
Right.

2888
02:12:02,721 --> 02:12:04,580
You know,
I see life from his perspective,

2889
02:12:04,581 --> 02:12:07,100
you know,
and I'm like when you guys get along

2890
02:12:07,101 --> 02:12:07,880
together,
great.

2891
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:10,310
It's like a great dynamic.
The two of you together,

2892
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:11,540
it works really well.
Oh,

2893
02:12:11,541 --> 02:12:13,730
I love it.
I don't see him too much during the week

2894
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:17,480
so I keep the relationship fresh.
We taught all the time.

2895
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:19,970
I torment them all.
The dad called him.

2896
02:12:19,971 --> 02:12:21,110
I go,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

2897
02:12:21,130 --> 02:12:21,850
It was,
what are you talking to?

2898
02:12:21,850 --> 02:12:23,270
My buddy just got a letter from the
state.

2899
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:29,140
Why is your fucking phone tapped?
I taught math them for 20 minutes about

2900
02:12:29,301 --> 02:12:30,051
his phone,
but why?

2901
02:12:30,051 --> 02:12:32,030
Why?
Why my boeing fleet that I go,

2902
02:12:32,031 --> 02:12:35,630
do you work for the cia?
Is that been made you come over and take

2903
02:12:35,631 --> 02:12:37,440
my acid so you can report back?

2904
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:39,850
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2905
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:47,370
Don't worry about it must have been a
mistake.

2906
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:53,020
And the guy got me the liquid acid,
right?

2907
02:12:53,021 --> 02:12:55,510
I called him and I said,
listen,

2908
02:12:55,511 --> 02:12:58,090
I got a liquid ass.
I mean you could hear him getting

2909
02:12:58,091 --> 02:13:00,970
anxiety on the phone because I don't
know.

2910
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:03,640
You could hear a little bit.
And then he goes,

2911
02:13:03,641 --> 02:13:05,140
how are we going to do it?
I said,

2912
02:13:05,141 --> 02:13:07,570
so we're going to get sugar cubes and
put the acid on it.

2913
02:13:08,110 --> 02:13:09,580
But I called them back.
I a daily.

2914
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:11,890
I hadn't had no assets and I had no
sugar cubes.

2915
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:13,960
I just made it up.
I go,

2916
02:13:13,961 --> 02:13:16,540
listen,
I just put the acid on the cube sugar

2917
02:13:16,541 --> 02:13:19,630
cubes and I put them in a tupperware and
I put a lid on it and I left.

2918
02:13:19,631 --> 02:13:21,160
And when I came back to lynn had blown
up.

2919
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:24,370
So whenever that acid is going to be
really fucking strong,

2920
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:26,260
I go,
I put aluminum foil over.

2921
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:30,610
It would hold so it could breathe.
So the acid won't fucking go into.

2922
02:13:30,611 --> 02:13:32,370
Oh my god.
Had them gone for two weeks.

2923
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:34,260
I go to cleveland.
Guess what?

2924
02:13:34,261 --> 02:13:37,100
Some guy comes up to me,
gives me a tube of this is the

2925
02:13:37,110 --> 02:13:40,420
pharmaceutical grade shit.
This will kill gaddafi.

2926
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:46,950
I go home,
we put drops on his cue on need sugar

2927
02:13:46,951 --> 02:13:49,920
cube.
Oh my fucking god.

2928
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:52,080
Yeah.
But see again,

2929
02:13:52,081 --> 02:13:54,720
that's why I quit everything because my
tolerance is too hot.

2930
02:13:55,230 --> 02:13:57,990
Back in the deck of the two drops.
Ipi for 12 hours,

2931
02:13:57,991 --> 02:13:59,550
seeing things,
unicorns.

2932
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:02,310
I seen something like two hours.
But you,

2933
02:14:02,311 --> 02:14:04,230
who knows what,
how strong it really was to.

2934
02:14:04,231 --> 02:14:06,960
And you're getting it from cleveland.
You've got to get it from like northern

2935
02:14:06,961 --> 02:14:07,781
California.
Oh no,

2936
02:14:07,781 --> 02:14:08,760
no.
But then I lost.

2937
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:11,160
I lost the 10 sheet from a guy in
england.

2938
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:14,530
A guy in england gave me some stuff.
Pink floyd and I said this,

2939
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:17,550
the same one that syd barrett took when
he quit pink floyd.

2940
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,770
So I took that.
I saved that.

2941
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:22,950
So now I'm going to get the liquid acid.
I'm going to put it on the blog or from

2942
02:14:22,951 --> 02:14:26,130
pink floyd and we're going to go deep.
I'm just saving that one for a good

2943
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:26,993
guest.

2944
02:14:29,890 --> 02:14:31,200
I like it.
Well,

2945
02:14:31,201 --> 02:14:33,120
