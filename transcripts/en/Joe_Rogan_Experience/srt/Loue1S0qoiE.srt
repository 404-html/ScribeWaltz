1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,970
Oh Shit.
We're live ladies gentlemen.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,970
The Joe Rogan experience podcast
is brought to you by on it.com.

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:10,050
If you go to o,

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,430
n n I t you can check out
all the different products,

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,490
the new tropics,
the uh,

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,120
sports exercise shit like shroom
tech sport, fascinating stuff.

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,940
It's based on the quarter subs
mushroom, which somehow or another, uh,

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,650
helps your body process oxygen Benner,
it gives you a just a bit more endurance.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,200
You can feel it, especially if
you take four. That's what I do.

10
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:35,250
I take four before Jujitsu, shroom
tech sport, check into that shit.

11
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,490
If you're really into
working out or if you,

12
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:41,250
you're going to high altitude people have
had success with that stuff. If there,

13
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:44,190
uh, if you're, if you're like living
at sea level and you go into altitude,

14
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,790
you can, it takes your body
awhile to deal with that.

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,260
And that's supposedly is where they found
this quarter. [inaudible] mushroom. The,

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:51,571
the,

17
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:56,460
the story behind it was that cattle were
eating these mushrooms and they were,

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,110
uh, a bit more active. And so the,
uh, the cattle range of people said,

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,460
well,
what's in these mushrooms?

20
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:06,720
And they started eating them and
apparently it helps your body.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,930
When you're at a higher altitude,
you have less oxygen.

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,950
It's just a good endurance supplement.
Not, you know, it's nothing crazy,

23
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:18,000
but it gives you a boost so you can
feel, um, what does, what is Alpha brain,

24
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,370
all this stuff.
The information is much more,

25
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,960
it's much better described
by the people in on it.

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,530
If you go to the website,
check it out, look into it.

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,020
If you try it and you don't like it,

28
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,860
there's a 100% money back guarantee
on the first order of 30 pills.

29
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,480
My version of on it would be a totally
different website if it was me describing

30
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:41,480
it or if you were describing it and mine
would be like, Yo, I'm taking new mood.

31
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:43,850
Did a bunch of x this not this weekend.

32
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,470
Help you when you did x,
did it help you brain? Well,

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,930
I think if you're,
if,

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,450
if you remember roll on and roll
off and all that stuff like that,

35
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,980
that that's what you know,
it's the, the, it's, it helps,

36
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,130
it helps your brain grow back.

37
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,300
What it needs to grow back in
my website and your website.

38
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,050
It gets my brain juice going again.

39
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,940
All of them, Alpha brain and
new mood, all these nutrients.

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,190
It's nutrients that that aid in
your brain's ability to produce

41
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:17,180
neurotransmitters.

42
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,630
And I always say that that coming out
of my mouth is just a bunch of noise.

43
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:23,390
I'm just repeating things
that smart people have said.

44
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,580
I'm not really smart
enough to understand the,

45
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,520
even the idea of neurotransmitters,
what they really are.

46
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,800
So I shouldn't even be
allowed to use that word.

47
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,990
But since that is what
scientifically, that's how it's
described, I use that word.

48
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,170
So just understand it's coming from
the mouth of an idiot who's really into

49
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:43,640
vitamins, but it works. Uh, check
it out. Use a code name. Rogan,

50
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,280
save yourself 10% off. We also have
a kettle bells and battle ropes. And,

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,990
and uh, I've talked about these
many times in the podcast.

52
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:54,920
One of the things that I think if you
really like lifting weights with one of

53
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:58,700
the things that's cool about lifting
weights as you can with your willpower,

54
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,310
take your body and turn it
into a stronger, better body,

55
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,970
like a body that works really well.
And I said to a friend of mine,

56
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,880
we were having this discussion about
this and he's, he doesn't work out.

57
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:10,601
And I was like,

58
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:15,160
if you could take a pill
that could instantly turn
you into like a super athlete

59
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,500
and instantly turned you into
like a Michael Jordan, you know,

60
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,650
would you take that pill?
Well you can,

61
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,750
like someone can be Michael Jordan.

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,860
You just have to work out as hard as that
guy did. Like it can be accomplished.

63
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,060
Like you can transform your body
into a body that works better.

64
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:34,870
Like you really can, not with a pill,
but with your app, your own will,

65
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,850
your own will and exercises.

66
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,390
And my favorite way to work out is with
kettlebells and that's why we started

67
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:43,900
selling them an on a.com. Um, I
think for functional strength,

68
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:47,860
it's one of the best exercises
in the world. It's all your,

69
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,580
everything that you do with kettlebells
pretty much is your use your whole body

70
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,000
as one unit to move
this cannon ball around.

71
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,010
There's hundreds of videos online for
free on youtube if you want to buy him.

72
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:02,950
Steve Maxwell has excellent ones,
is a guy named Mike Muller.

73
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,030
He's got excellent ones.

74
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,870
All different videos that can show
you how to workout with kettle bells.

75
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,590
And it's, in my opinion, one of
the best workouts for your body,

76
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,280
for anything where if you, if, if it
would help you in whatever you do,

77
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:19,240
whether it's a sport, you
know, whether it's at work,

78
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,770
if you have to pick
things up at work a lot,

79
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,400
if it would help you
to be stronger and to,

80
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:25,570
to have a body that can
move things heavier,

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,090
better than kettlebells
are going to aid you.

82
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,570
For me and Jujitsu made a huge
difference in my endurance, like,

83
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,570
uh, the, my ability to,
to, to keep going, uh,

84
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:41,290
in like high pressure rolls when you're
rolling with somebody who's really good,

85
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,890
something like kettlebells makes a big
difference and you're focusing on the

86
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:48,400
alien freaking people out. And, uh,

87
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,200
alienware's not our sponsor,

88
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:54,670
but a sucker punch entertainment hooked
us up with these cool Alienware laptops

89
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:58,990
and we uh, we like them
because Alienware uh, is a,

90
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,800
a big company and they support
them and may fighters. So,

91
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,020
so we're kissing their butts so we're
kind of kissing their ass. Yeah.

92
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,670
So that's it.
You dirty bitches.

93
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,030
Go to [inaudible] dot com get yourself
some weights. Get you swole on.

94
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,430
You know what I'm saying, son?
Get your battle ropes and gear.

95
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,080
Justin Helpern is here and we're going
to get down to the nitty gritty about the

96
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,270
San Diego Los Angeles Commute.

97
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,390
And what's the difference between these
two mother fuckers? Give me a sec.

98
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,100

101
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,670
No, it was, it was
interesting. It was definitely,

102
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,760
you definitely threw a curve ball. I need
to get more sound effects or something.

How you doing? Thanks for having me.

107
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,020
So you were, you're the dude to created
the shit. My Dad says Twitter account,

108
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,380
which became a cultural phenomenon
as you man. Yeah, no, it's crazy.

109
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:14,990
It was just that I was just, I was a
bad mother fucker. I listen, that's me.

110
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,180
My Dad is,
I dunno.

111
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,570
Is it all really stuffy says or do you
kind of juice it up a little bit of right

112
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,370
now and then,

113
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,030
oh, you edit it to get into
the 140 characters and Twitter.

114
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,600
Cause like he couldn't talk his
sentiments. Yay. I definitely, I mean he,

115
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,740
he would fucking flip out if I,
if I,

116
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,410
he cause he checks it like once every
two months to make sure it's like stuff

117
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:37,290
that he said.
So

118
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,290
how does he feel about this man that's
gotta be a trip all of a sudden your,

119
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,140
your, your, your likeness is being
portrayed on television by Captain Kirk.

120
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,800
Yeah. That he, that he was
like, the show is shitty

121
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,490
and I don't, I don't totally
disagree, but, uh, he didn't,

122
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,330
he honestly didn't give a shit about
William Shatner or the TV show it all.

123
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,910
He liked the book that I wrote.
He was like into that.

124
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,920
He's more into reading
than he is watching TV.

125
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,860
Have you ever thought about putting a
camera on him? Does he want to do that?

126
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,730
He would hurl it to the
ground. Yeah. He's not,

127
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,210
he's not into that at all. He's
just, he really that guy. Yeah.

128
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:18,690
I mean he weird line though. You've,
you've kind of drawn, you know,

129
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:20,700
you've like depicted him.
Yeah.

130
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:23,610
Well I was really worried about telling
Niggas ain't even tell him at first,

131
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:26,580
you know, first couple of months I didn't
think I just, it was for my friends,

132
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:28,960
so I was like, nobody's going to
see this, so there's no, we're,

133
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,360
I shouldn't bother him with it.

134
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,300
And then when it's like blew
up and people were like, Hey,

135
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:36,480
are you interested in doing a book? I was
like, well, I should tell my dad first.

136
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,250
When did you start the Twitter account?
It is crazy. I started in August,

137
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,250
2009 and by I think like August 21st I
started August 3rd August 21st I had like

138
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:49,560
300,000 followers.
It was nuts.

139
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:52,980
Like it just went viral and then
probably like two weeks later,

140
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:57,540
is that a million? Holy Shit.
Yeah, it was. It was like
right when Twitter was like,

141
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,740
you remember that like Ashton
Kutcher race to a million?

142
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,970
Like that kind of bullshit was
going on and and so it was like,

143
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:06,200
it was in the news. Like if it
happened now, I don't know. But,

144
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:10,020
but back then it was like perfect
timing. Wow. It's amazing.

145
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,390
That's incredible.
So just out of the word of mouth,

146
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:16,730
basically people just
sharing it with themselves.

147
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,400
It literally went viral
to a million people.

148
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,090
Yeah. Yeah, it did. I think like it
was at like 10,001 day when I went to,

149
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,961
I went to bed,

150
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:29,940
it was at 10,000 and then rob Corddry
tweeted it and then he like tweeted a link

151
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:33,580
like I like this. And it was rob Corddry
rob, of course, he's like comedian. He,

152
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:37,350
he was like a hot tub time machine
and the daily show and stuff.

153
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,630
He was just like, uh, I'm
sure I know him. Yeah, yeah,

154
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm sure you cross paths with him at
some point and he had like a million

155
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:46,440
followers or something.
And so when he tweeted it out,

156
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,280
then all of a sudden the next day it
was like 100,000 is kind of just going

157
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:53,970
faster and faster and people kept sharing
it and then it was like, all right,

158
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:58,110
well what am I going to do now? How old
were you when this was going on? 29. Wow.

159
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,660
And was, what is this like, I mean,
you're sitting there going, okay,

160
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:03,210
what do I need that, what would
it, what do I do with this? Yeah,

161
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,970
well I was living at home,
so like I was,

162
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,300
I was riding for Maxim
and I was living at home.

163
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:14,100
I just split up with my a girl or sheets,
whatever was made to be more frank.

164
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,350
Um, and, uh,

165
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,800
and so I just like didn't know what the
fuck I was gonna do cause I was just

166
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:24,030
sitting there and I was like
living in my childhood bedroom.

167
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,550
It was like really depressing.
So yeah.

168
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:29,670
And then when all this stuff
started happening, you know,

169
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:33,120
I'd been riding for a while and I had
been up here riding and waiting tables and

170
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:35,520
doing all that stuff and then been
writing for magazines last couple of years

171
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,940
before that. And then this guy reached
out to me and he's like, maybe you could,

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,830
you know, is there, maybe
there's a book in this.

173
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,080
And so then I started to sort of sit
down and write some essays about just

174
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,280
stories up me and my dad and
then sort of submitted them.

175
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,320
How many stories do you have? I got
a lot of stories. He's crazy. Um,

176
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,470
but uh,
for the book I wrote like 12 essays.

177
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,710
So like if that book was single
spaced and in like normal font,

178
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:02,950
it'd be like nine pages. But,
but, but uh, yeah, I mean, I,

179
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,020
that book was like, yeah, around 12 or
13 essays, maybe like 160, 170 pages.

180
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:11,670
And I kinda just tried to keep
ones that didn't feel redundant. So

181
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,010
is your dad just like
always on about everything?

182
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:17,320
Does he always have something
funny to say about everything?

183
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,940
Is he just that guy all day?

184
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,810
Nah, he, he's not, he's not like,

185
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:24,530
he'll be just like quiet for two hours
and then he'll just like explode on you.

186
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,600
Um, he just like a lot of Shit
pisses him off. Right. You know,

187
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,411
and so,

188
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:32,570
and he doesn't have a lot of people
to talk to because he doesn't have any

189
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:35,780
friends. So yeah. For my mom, uh, I
mean that's the way he wants it though.

190
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:39,620
Like he doesn't, he doesn't want, yeah,
he really doesn't. He's like my best.

191
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,610
He's like, my best friend
lives in Tennessee. I see
him once a year. I'm like,

192
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:47,870
that's it. That's not a good, best friend.
I think the ball, why has he chosen?

193
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:52,190
That's, that's mean that behavior is a
cause. Like Jude not want to have friends.

194
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,250
He just would rather be able to not say
like say whatever he wanted unfiltered,

195
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,840
but he always just tells the truth.

196
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,230
So you kind of lose a lot
of friends along the way.

197
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:04,580
You would think you would gain him.

198
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,490
He the ones he has like two or
three and they're super close.

199
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:11,510
Like they're grizzle all guys that say
shit like I died for you. You're like,

200
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:16,040
when would that ever come
up? But okay. So yeah.

201
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:20,320
But I mean like he, he, he's not,
so he's not always on, but yo,

202
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:24,380
he's got really like interesting. He grew
up in the south and, but he's a doctor,

203
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,080
so like he grew up on a farm.
He was in the military.

204
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:31,430
He was like a tobacco farmer until he
was like, you know, 1516 so, you know,

205
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:33,110
I think he's got a unique perspective.

206
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,940
Wow. Yeah. That's a pretty intense life.

207
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,860
But he doesn't want to do anything
publicly. He doesn't want to like be,

208
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,290
you know, I mean if you ever
interviewed him on anything,

209
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,120
Yeah. You know, I did for this, for
my second book that came out, I did a,

210
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,850
I was like, well, I was like, you
didn't want like you have a lot of fans,

211
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:53,500
you want to do that? Like nobody gives a
shit about me. Like they want to see you,

212
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,490
do you want to like,
I was like,

213
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,470
do you want to do like a
video interview or something?

214
00:11:56,471 --> 00:12:00,550
That's if you buy the Ebook, you get
like, you know, whatever. And he was like,

215
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,490
I'll do it if it's you, me
and the camera. And I'm like,

216
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,610
well what about somebody to run the
camera? He's like, fucking, I'm out. Like,

217
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,460
all right, fine. I'll run the
camera and be inner. Yeah.

218
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,640
So I was like me turning on the camera
and then running over and sitting in the

219
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:13,430
thing.

220
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,930
Wow. What is, he just doesn't
want another person in the room.

221
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,410
He just doesn't get along
with people that well. Wow.

222
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,980
So he's just a grizzled old dude.

223
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:27,780
Like I feel like maybe that's
how they made them back
then. I don't know. But, uh,

224
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,690
I mean, like the thing, the weird thing
is if you came up to him on the street,

225
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:33,150
he'd be like a perfect gentleman.
You know? Like he'd be totally, yeah.

226
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,410
Who would he be keeping it together?
He doesn't really want to talk to you.

227
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,920
Not really going to be rude to you.
He just doesn't really want to.

228
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:43,030
So he picks out a couple of people, like
his family and he's like, this is it.

229
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,890
This is, these are the
people I talked to. Yeah.

230
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,160
They're not talking to anybody else.
Yeah.

231
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,380
That's how my grandfather was also really,

232
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:51,560
my grandfather was really
just like one of those like,

233
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:56,210
scream at your wife doors, get
over here and just like, not like,

234
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,010
I'm not a happy,
I grew up with a grandfather who was a,

235
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,600
he's a great guy,

236
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,440
but him and his wife
fought like cats and dogs.

237
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:08,960
It was crazy.
My grandparents,

238
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:11,810
you still fucking scream at each other.

239
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,340
They would scream at each other that I
was like, fallout four, five, you know,

240
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:20,870
it was like this little monkey watching
these crazy old Italians don't wash be

241
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:25,640
Zhao, don't you fucking rush Mary
screaming at my grandfather. I'm like,

242
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:30,350
whoa. That's what I remember. I remember
at a very early age going, Whoa,

243
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,980
the relationships can go this far south.
Fuck man,

244
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,000
dude. I think, I feel like people
back then, they used to do like,

245
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,420
they love each other.
Yeah.

246
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,840
It's a little harder life and nobody's
getting divorced as much as they are now.

247
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,470
Yeah. It's a totally different
world, man. It was a dangerous,

248
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:48,530
scary world back then. That was
it. That, you know, they lived,

249
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,310
they lived through the world wars, the
depression, like that kind of shit.

250
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:56,090
My grandparents came over here during
the depression, you know, that's like,

251
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:59,390
that's when they arrive. They arrived
like right in the middle of the shit.

252
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,680
So the fact that they were saying it all,
you know,

253
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,650
the fact that they made it through and
had family and actually have those family

254
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:10,580
like go off and that survive on their
own in the wild. It's incredible.

255
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,060
Yeah. I feel like it was, I mean, I know
it sounds Kinda like cliche to say it,

256
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,760
but it was just a way harder existence.
Yeah. You had to be way tougher.

257
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,200
You had it to be, you had to be someone
who dealt with a lot more tragedy,

258
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:24,770
that's for sure. Yeah. For the most
part, you know, he just, you know, you,

259
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,640
I think the world was just
a harsher, more, you know,

260
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:32,310
more animalistic place almost back then.
You didn't want to hear any,

261
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:36,110
we didn't want to hear any bullshit.
Yeah. It's unfortunate, man.

262
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,460
So many people from those really
hard errors grew up without much joy.

263
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,210
You know, they have like funny shit to
say. What is this angry, fucked up funny.

264
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:45,800
Yes.

265
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,620
Well my dad was a,

266
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:51,790
he grew up on a tobacco farm when
he was like 10 he worked the farm,

267
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,550
you're like 10 he fell off a wagon and
rolled over her arm and it crushed his

268
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:59,450
elbow. When they took him to the doctor,
the doctor's told his dad, he was like,

269
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,070
I can amputate his arm and he'll live
for sure. Or I can give them like these,

270
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,160
this medication, and maybe there's
only a 30% chance that he lives.

271
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,560
And he said his dad was like,
let 'em die. There's no,

272
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,450
there's no room in the
world for one arm farmer.

273
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,880
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

274
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,430
Just like how it was back then. The doctor
was like, all right, cool. And then just,

275
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,830
it gives him the stuff. Wow. Yeah.

276
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,290
That was his dad's had let them
die. Yeah. He said, let him die.

277
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,180
There's no room in the
world for one arm farmer.

278
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,850
Holy Shit. Imagine thinking that
when you're 10 that you, you,

279
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:35,900
you're not even, no one cares about
you. Your arm is broken. And then like,

280
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,734
let them die

281
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,780
as, this is how crazy my dad is. When
he told me that story, I was like,

282
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:43,050
that's so fucked up. He's like, what
are you talking about? He saved my arm.

283
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:48,180
I'm like, are you insane?
Like that's, Oh my God,

284
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,020
Jesus Christ.

285
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,530
I've been watching all these
documentaries recently about neanderthals,

286
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,860
you know, and about, uh, you know,

287
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:00,770
this is like people that
are talking about not like,

288
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,340
they're pretty much pretty sure that
most white people have some percentage of

289
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:05,210
neanderthal in us.

290
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,870
And imagine if you for some reason had
to go back to that time and survive.

291
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,830
Imagine how hard that would suck to be
making spears with fucking rocks and

292
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,020
animals seeing you.
I mean,

293
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,530
would you just like take your clothes off
and just walk into the ocean and drown

294
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,280
and would you just give up? I mean,
would you even want to get to today?

295
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,730
I've actually thought a lot
about that cause I was like,

296
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,630
I thought about like how far back in time
I'd have to go to actually be able to

297
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:38,350
invent anything. That was cool and
I don't know how to, anything works.

298
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:41,480
I just used those. I would, if that
was the case. Yeah, I would just, Oh,

299
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,423
do what you say.

300
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,920
Think like, man, do I really,
I think your, your survival
instincts would kick in,

301
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,740
but you know, you wouldn't
have this, you know,

302
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:54,741
this esoteric search for happiness is
deep search for how like everybody has.

303
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:59,250
Like I just don't know where I'm at
at this point in my life. Like, okay,

304
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,980
you know why?
Because there's no fucking struggle.

305
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,220
You're getting through your day hopping
in your range rover with your little

306
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:08,130
tiny dog and there's just
no real struggle. Okay,

307
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:12,780
so you're confused and you're sad and
you might be happier if you were chasing

308
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,350
animals with a fucking
point. You stick. Yeah.

309
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,050
You might be happy if you are running
a farm. You might be, might be ma'am.

310
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,880
I mean you can even see it today and like
really shitty countries. Nobody's like,

311
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,120
hmm, should I pursue a law degree? You're
like, no, I just want to stay alive.

312
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,410
Just fucking stay alive.
Yeah, there's a Lotta,

313
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,620
there's a lot of weirdness to this life.

314
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,870
I know this life is w we,
we might not be set up to handle it.

315
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,560
You know,
we might not be set up to,

316
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,310
to deal with all the pressures that
technology and society and all this,

317
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,010
all this information that's
coming at us all the time.

318
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,000
Not might not be set up for that shit.

319
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,610
Well it's like you were saying before we
started like people get crazy when they

320
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:55,444
get online.

321
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,220
Yeah. Some people do. It's a,

322
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,410
some people it's like thick had finally
lash out. They could fuck the world back.

323
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:07,640
Like the world's fucking them, you know,
they just feel like the world fucks them.

324
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:12,010
Like everywhere they turn it's like this
is not working out. You know, you're,

325
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,260
you're looking at television, you
know, that's not my life. You know,

326
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,300
you're looking at there.

327
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,440
The reality is most people out there not
doing exactly what they want to do and

328
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,480
they want to be angry at somebody
and all day the most of them work.

329
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,860
And if you're working, most of the time
you have to keep your fucking mouth shut.

330
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,280
You can't say what you want to say.
You can't, you're in an office.

331
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,550
So with a bunch of people
you could actually get sued
for trying to crack jokes.

332
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,330
You know, you can't say anything
sexual, you know, if you do,

333
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:44,030
you're going to go to court. I ain't
going to get sued for sexual harassment.

334
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:49,031
It's like it's really restrictive
environment and then they get online,

335
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:53,300
they don't like you fucking suck,
fucking kill yourself,

336
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,040
drown in aids.
And it's like these,

337
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:01,010
it is concentrated attack on like
Brittany Spears or you know, or anybody.

338
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,050
That's what it is. It's like this just
fucking this, this little volcano of hate.

339
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,520
It just pops out. It's because
he's poor folks live a shit life.

340
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:15,130
I had ones when she might add,
says first started getting popular and uh,

341
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,670
like I got a,
I got a book deal out of it and uh,

342
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:22,540
I was checking at replies the day
it did and this guy had filled up,

343
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,670
cause you can only have 140
characters per tweet. Right.

344
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:29,050
He had filled up like 15 or 20
tweets just to haul caps. Faggot.

345
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,960
This is actually my dad's us. It
was just nonstop. Uh, he like,

346
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:38,680
he spent like probably like 10
or 15 minutes just doing nonstop.

347
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,390
But there's something funny about
that though. Did you laugh laughing?

348
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,050
Like I took a screenshot of it and
set it all my friends and stuff.

349
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,690
That's fucking great man. That
is great. When it's silly bitch.

350
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,320
Is there a,

351
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,820
a tweet that you did that it's your
favorite one that you still like look back

352
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:02,320
and I'm like, man, that was great. And
that's like one in particular? Yeah,

353
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:05,860
I mean there, cause like for me, he's, he
said them to me, you know, so I was like,

354
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:09,250
there's context to it and stuff.
And this one time he, he, he,

355
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,480
he like loves our dog more than
like people in and he brought our,

356
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,960
he took the dog to the dog park.

357
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,460
He walked in one day I'm sitting on the
couch and he's like, he's like, well,

358
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:22,120
I guess, uh, were, were banned from
the dog park. And I was like, Oh fuck.

359
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:26,590
What happened? He's like, I guess it's
okay to Barak and it's okay to hump,

360
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,260
but if you do both at the same time,
it freaks people out.

361
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,030
It's just like the thought of my dog
is like angrily raping other dogs like

362
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,093
there.

363
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,510
And then my dad is somebody having to
come to my dad say something about it.

364
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,700
Like it wasn't what he said
that was so funny on me.

365
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:46,750
It was just like that
scenario. We laugh. That's,

366
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,530
you were one of the first, uh, uh, Twitter
followers that I remember that. Like,

367
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,970
what's it like? Cool. Like I found
this, this, this, the hilarious Twitter.

368
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:01,540
And then my girlfriend, I told her at her
at the time and she was like, oh my God,

369
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,670
this is the best thing ever. And she
told her, Megan, I just watched it like,

370
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,600
like become like something
I thought I found myself.

371
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,910
And then growing to just being everywhere.

372
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,410
You were pretty much being retweeted by
every single person. I know at one point,

373
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,080
uh, have you, cause I have you,

374
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:17,990
yeah.

375
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,340
Like are you over it now?

376
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:21,050
Are you [inaudible] gotten
to a point where you're like,

377
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:24,260
I just want to write books
now and, or, or is it, do you,

378
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,170
are you still in love with
Twitter doing the Twitter thing?

379
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,750
I mean I gotta be honest like it,

380
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:32,840
it was such a lucky break for
me that I sort of just feel,

381
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,220
I mean it sounds cheesy,

382
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:37,370
but I feel just like really grateful
for everything that's happened.

383
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:41,140
So to me it's never like it didn't
wear off and like, ah, I do this,

384
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,690
I got this dumb thing here. It's like,
well that fucking made my whole career.

385
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:48,200
So yeah, I mean to me I
still, I don't do it as much,

386
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,970
but I definitely don't have like that
same kind of feeling where it's like I'm

387
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:56,120
over this. So like something
that I really connect with,

388
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:59,480
I guess he must've been so site. Do you
totally hit the lottery? It was exotic.

389
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,790
It was exactly like hitting the lottery.
There really was.

390
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,280
That's amazing. What did you
want to do before you did that?

391
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,510
Did you always want to be a writer?

392
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,150
Yeah,
I had worked up here.

393
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I'd waited tables in La and I like I
had sold a screenplay and like quip

394
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,730
stupidly quit my job and then had to go
back to it. I have to run out of money,

395
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:18,080
but like I had been, you
know, struggling as a,

396
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,800
as a screenwriter for a while and then,
and uh,

397
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:25,410
so this was exactly what I wanted to do,
you know, sort of like gifted to me. Okay.

398
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,740
Wow. And from there you do,
how do you get this TV deal?

399
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,460
How's that happen and how do they did
William Shatner to play your dad and like

400
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,210
where did it all go? A
foul? Because it's a, it's,

401
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:40,150
it's a fascinating that they've found
a way to make something that's really

402
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:44,800
funny. Not that funny. No, it's true.
I mean it's really like, that's exactly

403
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:49,730
wait would happen. It's like
find the center and pour
water. Um, it, uh, you know,

404
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,140
like I wrote the book proposal and I had
sent it out just as a book and the book

405
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:57,050
was just like, are rated like the
Twitter feed, you know, but with stories.

406
00:22:57,051 --> 00:23:01,850
And then as soon as it got out there,
then network started calling being like,

407
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:04,700
we want to do this. And I remember saying
to my, I have a screenwriting partner.

408
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,780
I remember saying to him, I'm like,
how could we do this on a network? It,

409
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,470
he's says fuck every other word, like
we can't do it on a network. And,

410
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,960
and then, uh, and then I was like, wait,

411
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:19,520
I need to just shut up and it just
like do this, you know, and try and,

412
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:20,420
uh,
it just,

413
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:25,010
I remember early on we
sat with the standards and
practices person at CBS cause

414
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:28,850
we ended up, I pitched it and
we sold the CBS and, and uh,

415
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,930
when we sold the standards and
practices person was like, all right,

416
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,740
here's the list of words that you can't
say or even like intimate, you know,

417
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,150
and uh, intimate and, and uh,
it was like everything he says.

418
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,630
And I was like, all right, this is,
that's ridiculous. This is gonna suck

419
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,620
about your conversation with the standards
of practices. Person can be mad. Dang.

420
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,140
Yeah. Usually like why you
can't blind, it's really,

421
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,280
it's amazing what you can and can't say.

422
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,170
What people don't understand is like
cable, you can say anything. Yeah.

423
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:04,100
And the only reason why they don't say
everything is just their own discretion.

424
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,910
It's the idea that sponsors don't
want to be on a show that, you know,

425
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:12,890
says fucking cunt and whatever. So,
but the FCC doesn't regulate cable.

426
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,590
Yeah, it's crazy. I mean, yeah,
it was, I guess. And I also like,

427
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,960
because after we did that, when we
got Shatner to s to set to star in it,

428
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,390
um, I was like, well maybe
you know, like he'll,

429
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,000
it'll when coming through his
mouth it will sound different.

430
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:29,460
But it was just like,
my dad's like unintentionally funny.

431
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,000
He's not like cracking jokes
really in Sitcoms, you know,

432
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:35,910
it's like set up punchline
set up punchline and it,

433
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,160
and it just didn't fit that format at all.

434
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,700
I think with Hbo and Showtime,
I think in that works look ridiculous.

435
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,820
Tried trying to just only
use limited language like,

436
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:52,050
and with movies and like what kind of a
fucking stupid anti evolutionary concept

437
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:56,200
does that, oh, we're going to pretend
forever that these words are forbidden.

438
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,580
Like really, we live in a 2012 of the
Internet and we've got forbidden words.

439
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:02,980
You can't broadcast them.
And if they, if you do,

440
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:06,000
they can come and take your numbers.
Who will take your numbers away?

441
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,460
You know what the fuck kind of
science fiction movie is this.

442
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:12,490
There's certain sounds you can't make
with your mouth. There were illegal.

443
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,230
Even though the indistinguishable from,
you know,

444
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,230
other words that you can
get away with saying,

445
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:20,170
I mean everybody knows exactly
what the fuck you're talking about,

446
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,050
but if you say it with a certain sound,

447
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,050
certain sound that comes out of your
mouth, I think it's getting better,

448
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,220
but it's still the same. You can't
say can't on television. Yeah,

449
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,480
I bet at capital happened.

450
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,310
Can't see she's up can't because
sometimes someone's a cunt. You know,

451
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:36,941
you can't say that.

452
00:25:36,941 --> 00:25:39,700
You could never say that on television
now there there's no substitution.

453
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,720
There's no substitution for that word
in the right context, the right forum,

454
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,870
he should be allowed to use it. Do you
think about the right word? Got dammit.

455
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,890
Do you think it would happen though?

456
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:50,710
I think it would happen like right
before a woman becomes president.

457
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:54,880
That will probably go through
whenever we had.

458
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:56,420
It's not legislation where going to pat,

459
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,920
you should be able to use all
the words so it's so stupid.

460
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,970
It should always be about intent. And
what is your intent? What are you,

461
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,400
what are you trying to say?
It shouldn't be about words.

462
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:09,480
Shouldn't be about magic words.
That's craziness. You're,

463
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,480
you're artificially giving these words
power and making them ridiculous.

464
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,410
Eliminating them from all
discourse during the day. You know,

465
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,150
while you're at the business who can't be,

466
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,180
you know this fucking hunting
coffee machine can't say that.

467
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,270
That's why I went to like that old
guy that was a selling Winnebagos.

468
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:28,330
You remember that dude? Yes.
I or another viral sensation.

469
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,350
You ever seen that Brian? Yeah. The guy
is awesome, right? Why is it awesome?

470
00:26:32,351 --> 00:26:36,010
Because he's a fucking nice guy. Tried to
sell it a be on his ass. A fucking shit.

471
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,460
I'm fucking can't remember
this fucking pizza shit.

472
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:43,080
And of course I fucked my lines
up. You know, he gets going crazy.

473
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,930
Really Fun to watch because
you're looking at this guy,

474
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:50,250
he was like this button down poor fuck.
Who can't swear during the day

475
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,510
and you get to see like it's,
I think it's like real moments.

476
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,860
So that's what's enjoyable.

477
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:59,450
So when I see like a bull shitty sanitize
thing on narrow TV, you're like, well,

478
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,300
that's not how real people talk or

479
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,300
how weird must have been
for you because you will,

480
00:27:05,301 --> 00:27:10,040
this is coming from your dad who's
fucking hilarious to you and you know,

481
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:14,330
so it's inspiring to the, you write all
his shit down and put it out to people.

482
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,450
People respond to his exact words that
millions of them we'll do get onto your

483
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,750
Twitter and follow you.

484
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:25,751
So it's very obvious at that
combination in the exact form works.

485
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,750
But they're like, no, no, no.
You got to scrub it with bleach.

486
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:35,170
He just couldn't keep scrubbing it with
bleach until you have like this dead

487
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:38,180
version of what it could have been.
So stupid.

488
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,330
I mean,
that's the is exactly kind of stupid.

489
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,550
So dumb. They're the
same people. You dummies.

490
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,330
The same people that subscribed on Twitter
or this same people that would watch

491
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:51,740
the TV show are the same people that
would buy the products that they're,

492
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,400
they're pitching in their commercials.

493
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,620
It's the same fucking people to
pretend it's not and you're just,

494
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,980
you got to do something different by not
saying fuck. It's just, it's so dumb.

495
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,071
Yeah.

496
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:05,370
It was especially frustrating cause like
the Twitter feed had done really well

497
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:09,330
and then the book came out in the book
did really, really well and I was like,

498
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:09,601
all right,

499
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:13,650
so the two things that stay exactly
true to what our have done well and then

500
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,101
they're like,
I have,

501
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:17,970
well we're going to change it and we're
going to largely at fault just like

502
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:19,530
anyone else. I was
like, maybe it can work.

503
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,620
Yeah, of course. You wanted to believe
it works. You, you hit the lottery.

504
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:23,880
All of a sudden you have a TV show.

505
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:26,010
Of course you wanted to
believe it would work.

506
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,150
I mean I'm talking total
Utopian Society obviously,

507
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,980
but I just kind of feel like that has to
be one of the things that fucks us up.

508
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:40,290
It has to be when when language is
restricted and there's certain words that

509
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,300
actually have magical powers,

510
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,200
like if you say them someone without doing
anything physically, if you say them,

511
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:50,160
people get actually lock you up and find
you and do all sorts of things to you

512
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,970
if you say them and do the, you know,
the jurisdiction of the airwaves.

513
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,340
That's that's,
that's insanity.

514
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,140
That's a crazy notion and the fact
that we accept that. It's almost like,

515
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,560
except that you accept censorship
in any form you're going to,

516
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:09,330
except all the other craziness that
goes along with being governed as well.

517
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,510
It's like it's important
to make it all ridiculous.

518
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,530
Like this magic word thing might actually
be a key component to keeping people

519
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:19,530
close minded. If you can really convince
people that there are magic words,

520
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,590
it's such a dumb idea.
It might be like a mind prison

521
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,140
locks you hit. It locks you up in logic
to the point where you're, you're,

522
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,110
you're unable to analyze
the rest of the world.

523
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:34,380
It's like this complex thing
of don't say content. You know?

524
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:38,550
It's like this lock idea,
this segment in your brain.

525
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:41,800
You're a box which you
choose to only operate in.

526
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:47,220
Yeah, it's so crazy. It's funny too
cause like on regular basic cable TV,

527
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:49,050
like sometimes there'll be like the,
you know,

528
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,320
Hispanic station or whatever and they're
saying their version of fucking shit

529
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:57,030
and pussy and con. Yeah they are,
but it's in Spanish and so it just,

530
00:29:57,031 --> 00:30:00,030
just because I, we, you know, most
people don't understand that language.

531
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,630
Then it's cool. I got to learn Spanish.
That's what it is. I got to learn Spanish.

532
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,770
Fuck it. It's just so stupid, man.

533
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:10,800
It's like that's why people are so
turning to the Internet, not speak well.

534
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,960
That's a terrible sentence.

535
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:16,190
But that's why I think the Internet has
so much appeal to especially the younger

536
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,440
people.
It's like if you grow up with it,

537
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,820
it's really hard to go sit calm after
you go. You know like the style,

538
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,860
project.com never been a style project.

539
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,560
He was like the original right
style. Yeah. Getting them,

540
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,410
it was one of the original,

541
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,010
like if there was something fucked
up out there on the Internet,

542
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,920
he would have it on his website.
If some new shit went down,

543
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,400
you'd go to his website and he would
have it, whatever. It was like,

544
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,950
like crazy video situation shit.
Yeah. It's like naked girls

545
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:49,930
most fucked up things that dude
would have it, but it's, you know,

546
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,840
it's out there if you want to look,
it's,

547
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,080
yeah,

548
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,860
I mean that's the thing is like I think
pretending like it's not out there does

549
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:57,970
no one any favors.

550
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:02,690
So not helping anybody needs these fucking
stupid shows where you're not allowed

551
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:06,350
to use all the words like wow.
Enough already.

552
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:06,961
Yeah.

553
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:11,420
And the funny thing is is like it just
feels like you said it especially dated,

554
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,970
it's insulting.
It's insulting

555
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,063
it where there's,

556
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,700
how many wars going on simultaneously
and what we want to pretend that like

557
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:21,900
words are bad. This that's so,
it's so anti evolution of it.

558
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,460
It's so stupid that there was
forbidden words. I mean that's,

559
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:31,461
it's such a dumb premise that like if
you just accept that and that becomes a

560
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:35,220
major part of your society when you're
talking about your ability to communicate,

561
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,880
that becomes a major point. And
then it's like, well, wait a minute.

562
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:42,990
These words are totally forbid and you
can get arrested for him only if you use

563
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:46,920
them in in one certain
way if you broadcast them,

564
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,230
but you can use them and reach
the same amount of people.

565
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:53,310
If you do it on cable or the
Internet. That's cool. That's okay.

566
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,770
But so it's only censored in one way,

567
00:31:55,771 --> 00:31:58,020
but in this one way it's
like really bad for you.

568
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,420
Like if you get caught
like going on the news go,

569
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:03,570
unless you [inaudible] like don't
take a lot of money from you,

570
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:07,760
they could find you. You like, you're
forcing people to hear that. Like the SOS.

571
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,050
There's something to that.
The fact that you planned did,

572
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:13,310
it's probably like some first
degree type activity. You know,

573
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,790
they could probably like find you for a
really substantial amount of money for

574
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:21,450
purposely using magic words on,
on the radio or on television.

575
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,940
That's God.
That's maddening.

576
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,520
Yeah. It's funny when, uh, uh, I was
promoting this book, um, I wanted to s uh,

577
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,770
you can send out a tweet
that's like promoted so that
all of your followers will

578
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:32,581
definitely see it.
Cause you know,

579
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:35,430
people log in at different times and you
miss tweets and all that kind of stuff.

580
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:39,710
And so I sent out this tweet,
it was just a quote, my dad,

581
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:41,510
and then it had like by
the book, Blah, blah, blah,

582
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:45,630
after and it had like shit or fucking
the quote, I can't remember. And Twitter,

583
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:49,820
it was like, oh, we can't,
we can't promote that. We
can't show that. And I'm like,

584
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:53,510
but you're showing it to people who
already subscribe to my feed. Like Shit.

585
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:58,440
My Dad says in the title,
and they're like, yeah, but
we can't have, we can't, uh,

586
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,280
put something on somebody's feed
that has any profanity. I'm like,

587
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,510
but it's my fucking, they're already,
they're already following me.

588
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:08,570
I'm just making sure they see it.
It's like, it's bananas. Like it's,

589
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,590
it makes no sense. And that's in there,
like worried they're going to get sued.

590
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:13,424
You know?

591
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,470
I hope that that's something that
the Internet's going to dissolve.

592
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,900
Well, it, it's going to,

593
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:22,170
because like that's what NBC is not
going to be a television channel in five

594
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:25,890
years. It's going to be nbc.com.
It's, it's killing. It's killing the,

595
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,850
the live television broadcast,
which I know it seems crazy,

596
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:34,110
but it's nbcs not going to have money
broadcasting and spending all that money

597
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,320
when it's going to be, everyone's
going to be on the Internet, you know?

598
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,221
Well,
you know,

599
00:33:38,221 --> 00:33:41,700
some shows I think we'll be successful
because it costs a lot of money to make

600
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:46,130
them things like game of Thrones
like that, the, you know, that's,

601
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,210
that's a really, you need a studio. You
need a bunch of bad motherfucker. Yeah.

602
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:53,010
But that's not broad pointing together.
Right. Well and that's what's it,

603
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,550
that's what's keeping the language.
That's what I'm saying.

604
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:56,810
It's that it's the language.

605
00:33:56,811 --> 00:34:01,430
It's only because of live free
broadcast out like NBC, ABC,

606
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:05,690
CBS. But it's still, I think you're right.
I mean even for a network show, if you,

607
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,520
if you really want to like it costs
a lot of money to do that. Yeah.

608
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,750
It was going to say it lost or it's
going to say lost. Do you need,

609
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,950
you would need like a
real studio to make laws.

610
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,240
So I ain't mean they're going to have to
figure out a way to make money doing it

611
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:20,420
that way. I guess. I mean, what, what
do you think is going to happen? No,

612
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:20,900
that's what I'm saying.

613
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,410
I'm saying that the only thing
that's keeping censorship and,

614
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:28,040
and shit like that off of, of television
is the, the those channels. Right.

615
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,580
And when you think that they're going
to go though, you think there'd be just,

616
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:34,550
they're going to be an HBO work,
they're going to become an HBO on a cable,

617
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,360
a well your ear or deepen
the television industry.

618
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:40,050
You actually like what,
what did,

619
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:43,100
what did you executive produced that show
or something like that writer and it's

620
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:46,780
like your produce. How does it work? Is
it, are we onto that? Is that, I think,

621
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,030
I think what's going to end up, I
mean, fourth, the fact the line now,

622
00:34:49,031 --> 00:34:50,820
but I think it's,
uh,

623
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,480
to end up being where you can just
subscribe to each channel, right?

624
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,030
So if you don't have the good shows
people want, then fuck you. You Die.

625
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,131
You know?

626
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:05,131
For some folks it would
be advantageous to,

627
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,670
to stick with the way they do it
now and like not swear, you know,

628
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:10,990
this is probably a lot
of people out there.

629
00:35:10,991 --> 00:35:15,430
They'd probably like Dr. Quinn Medicine
woman type TV shows and like there's a

630
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:20,080
lot of money in selling those people
things. But how do they do that?

631
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:23,500
How they balance that and have
like good comedy at the same time.

632
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,120
Because if you really
want to have good comedy,

633
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,990
unless you're some Larry David type
genius that can create something like

634
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:30,250
Seinfeld,
you know,

635
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:35,080
most of you so straddled down as to what
you could have really said and talked

636
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:35,690
about.

637
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,010
Here's some good,
I mean the fucking radio is one of,

638
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,460
I mean there's shows a lucky,
crazy experience man. They,

639
00:35:42,461 --> 00:35:47,461
they snuck in and we all snuck in and
barely got by every year like this show,

640
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:52,470
like never took on,
took off at all until it was canceled.

641
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,320
And then it did like really
good and like repeats.

642
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:00,120
But it was a perfect combination of a
really funny show at like a super lucky

643
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:04,590
position to be in. You know, where it's
just, but then realizing that that's,

644
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,930
that's not even really enough.
Like you have to have someone who like,

645
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,160
they have to like promote you. You have
to get out there too. It's a weird,

646
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,600
the world of,
uh,

647
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,660
creating a sitcom that navigating the
waters of where you are at in the lineup

648
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:21,930
and it's a very, very, very
tricky situation for success.

649
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,720
And they also pump,
like I,

650
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:28,170
I was on a show [inaudible] on our show
last year that got canceled on CBS after

651
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:31,110
two episodes and there's a fucking
terrible shows, a disaster.

652
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,370
Some of them are so bad. It's scary. Yeah.
This one and this one was, was like that.

653
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:36,440
It wasn't really it,

654
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:39,180
it just was one of the things where
it was just a huge cluster fuck. And,

655
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,500
and they spent, I mean, this must
have spent 5,000 million dollars,

656
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:48,501
like in early promotion for the staff
and then two episodes just boom,

657
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:54,060
gone. It's crazy how they do
that and it happens all the time.

658
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:58,140
That's why they're so like hands on about
shit. Yeah. That's why they're there.

659
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:01,470
You know, it's expensive
to make a pilot man. Yeah.

660
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,970
That was a part of a super expensive
pilot ones where they made a fake jungle

661
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:07,980
set. Wow. It was, yeah,

662
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,750
it was a by the same guy who
produced a news radio, Paul Simms.

663
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,930
It was called overseas or something like
that. I think it was called overseas.

664
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,680
And uh,
it was crazy expensive to make man Leanna,

665
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,340
a whole like big fucking studio space.

666
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,180
It was trees and they had a pond.
They had a fucking pawn.

667
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,650
It was so crazy like that. We were
going to do this and pretend, I mean,

668
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:35,760
I dunno if it would've worked out all the
comedy. Yes. It was common, like lost,

669
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:39,630
but no, no, no. It was like, um, I'm
looking at, I don't remember the premise.

670
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:42,360
The premise was something like,
I went over there for one reason,

671
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:45,100
but I got stuck because I have a
good heart or something like that.

672
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:48,090
And next thing you know, I'm
overseas, whatever town, you know,

673
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,890
it's just that it's a
vehicle to develop comedy.

674
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,490
I don't even remember what it was.
I don't remember.

675
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,110
It was like they were
working with orphans.

676
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:59,060
I Dunno what the fuck it was that we
were over there doing, but this, this,

677
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,890
this idea that they would spend so
much money on this pilot, I mean to,

678
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,810
to make this fucking set alone.
It was ridiculous. It was so big.

679
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:11,730
It was a fucking fake jungle, you know?
And like why, how much is this gonna cost?

680
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,420
How much it's going to cost all the time.

681
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,900
You've got to maintain this
fake jungle you have out there.

682
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,800
You're going to drain all
that water though. I was,

683
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:21,390
the mosquitoes are going to grow in it.
The fuck are you doing?

684
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:25,980
But that must mean, you know when it
works, it just bucket loads of money.

685
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,920
When you find out like what
Seinfeld earned, you know,

686
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:33,150
I don't want to blow up his spot, but that
dude made some money and you go, whoa,

687
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:36,070
like a real hit, like a
Seinfeld. There's, that's like,

688
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,480
they're printing money. It's just,
whoa. It's like, it's crazy. It's like,

689
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:43,510
what do you like came up to a little boy.
How much money do you want?

690
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,250
I want $100 billion.
Here's $100 billion. Wow.

691
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,920
It's so crazy that you can make that
kind of money from a sitcom. Yeah.

692
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,840
It's funny I was on,

693
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,460
I was working at Warner Brothers at the
time when Charlie Sheen was going bat

694
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,210
shit. Right. Oh that must've been awesome.

695
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,520
It was crazy cause you'd sometimes
see him and it was like this are,

696
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,440
you saw him like come in as whacked
one time banging on the studio door.

697
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,140
There was no one there though.
And I just fucking kept driving.

698
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,480
I'm like cough card cause
I was like I don't want to,

699
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,560
I don't even want to be witnessed to this.
Like whatever.

700
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,990
But it was making so much money
and I remember people were like,

701
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,530
is he going to come back? Is it not
going to come back? I'm like dude,

702
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:25,260
it's coming back.
They'll figure it out.

703
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,890
They'll make up fucking CGI Charlie Sheen
and no come back cause it's making so

704
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:32,580
much money for people.
Well it's interesting.

705
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,440
They just moved on to Ashton Kutcher
and everybody's like that's cool.

706
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:39,010
We'll take it. I'm like, it's still really
fun. And we like it. We don't need to.

707
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:41,440
Charlie is it doing good now? I don't
even know where it was doing really good.

708
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:44,530
Yeah. I think it's still, the link's
doing great. I think it's doing great.

709
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,300
It's weird why Ashton Kutcher's funny.
You know, he can act as a handsome fella.

710
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,580
Great Bone structure. I think that
would be very pleasing to the ladies.

711
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,750
You know, I think they like it. I think
everything had worked out well. They got,

712
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:01,240
you know Charlie Charlie's a little crazy.

713
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,270
It's probably turned a lot
of those gals off. You know,

714
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,990
like I want to support the show,
but that Charlie Sheen and his behavior,

715
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:12,180
it's a conundrum, you know, I
don't want to support that. Oh Joe,

716
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,560
I'm sorry. I was gonna choose
a subject to completely, so

717
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,200
when you did your father,
you derailed it.

718
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,480
We're in the middle of a good God damn
Charlie Sheen breakdown Charlie Sheen and

719
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:28,030
figuring out what's really going on.
I was thinking,

720
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:29,860
cause you have sheen fever.
I just,

721
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,080
something popped in my head
right now and I was like, oh,

722
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:35,350
I remember we had that conversation of
all these people have been telling me

723
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,450
they would fuck George Clooney,
Clooney,

724
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,650
like guys that we know and I couldn't
remember who one was Brendan Walsh shirts.

725
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,740
I just remembered Sam triple.
He said he would fuck Obama if he could.

726
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,630
Jesus think you're even
supposed to say that. Yeah,

727
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:52,510
you got [inaudible]. You can't see
that dude. Don't say that. Well,

728
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,860
I was told I didn't say it. I really
don't think you can even say that.

729
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,670
Like have sex with the president. Yeah.
That's one of those things that be you.

730
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:03,760
You're kind of like you. You're not
allowed to saying that you, you can,

731
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,790
it is illegal to state that you would
want to assassinate or do harm to,

732
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:13,480
but I think it's probably rape in the
but is probably in there too. No, no.

733
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,230
I think you can. I think what Sam means,
like if you say that the same umbrella,

734
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,600
that's like a terrorist threat dude.

735
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,990
I think what Sam was saying is that that
Obama would want to have sex with them.

736
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,980
Like if he was gonna take up,

737
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,490
a lot of it came to them and like
came up and was like, oh damn.

738
00:41:26,491 --> 00:41:28,030
When we were allowed to imply that.

739
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:31,240
Especially considering the fact
that he's married and has children.

740
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,980
Well if he probably illegal
to imply that it's probably

741
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,490
is no salt on [inaudible].

742
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:40,280
You can't fuck Obama in any
way or leave him alone. Man,

743
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,800
I didn't know I want to stay for
the record that I did not want.

744
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,440
I'm not the one that said at Sam Tripoli
did. He shouldn't talk like that.

745
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,400
It said smart people, they go,

746
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:55,790
there's no need for that guy was like,
I around just what is it?

747
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:58,340
What kind of ideal planting
out there in society.

748
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:01,220
You don't want to be the list with the
under the heading of people who said

749
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:05,910
they'd fuck Obama, Chad.
Dude, it's a small list to,

750
00:42:05,911 --> 00:42:09,440
you'd be surprised. I bet by
the time they get to me, oh,

751
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:14,000
there's only five people that said it.
Oh Shit. I bet. One out of every girl,

752
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,600
every two girls would want have sex
with a mama. They've decided that,

753
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,490
well if you put it that
way, smoothie, oh I forgot.

754
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,770
I was thinking in my head, what would it
be like one hour three and I was like,

755
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:28,590
no one do we have to figure
out a fake number five.

756
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,680
But about 80% of the people would you
say no 90 you think 50% of the population

757
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:39,830
of women would want to fuck Obama if
they, if no one could find out? Yeah.

758
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,670
This would be a lot. It'd be a big
number. First of all, if you know,

759
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,290
if they both were like on a deserted
island or some point though,

760
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,260
if you got him into some
crazy fantasy situation,

761
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,880
a bone might be able to fuck 99% of the
women king of the hill though. Yeah,

762
00:42:55,881 --> 00:43:00,590
he wins. Yeah. It's like this is probably
some gay women who would fuck them.

763
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,070
Oh for sure. For sure. Just
sort of story. You know,

764
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,670
especially the gay women that are gay
because like every guy that ever met an

765
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,650
asshole, there's those guys
too, you know. They was,

766
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,570
I called them give up gaze the render.
Yeah,

767
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,320
girls just meet too many Douche bags
and I'm like, I give up, I'm going gay.

768
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,070
Cause girls will do that. They
can do that man. See I think what,

769
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:25,910
what Sam's thinking is that like Obama
would get one room at the w and then he

770
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:28,250
would get the one that's connected to it,
you know?

771
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,610
And they would just both on lock it in
the morning in the middle and then Sam

772
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:33,890
would come in there were like
wearing no clothes and just start,

773
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,560
you know like going down on Obama,
something like that. That's what I,

774
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,210
I think that's illegal too.

775
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,740
You know you're going to have a
drone flying above your head. Stupid.

776
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:46,550
I want you to stop. You
really need to stop. I think,

777
00:43:46,551 --> 00:43:49,070
well I didn't say it the
same for whoever this guy is.

778
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:52,190
He trying to send up the river
by talking through his mouth.

779
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,710
Maybe what he said then you should
have told them. Listen my friend,

780
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:56,960
how about you keep this
fucking shit to yourself. Oh,

781
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,650
we're all going to wind up
in the [inaudible] Bay. Maybe
that's journal material.

782
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,760
They're going to dress you up in a burka,
the dude and stick you in a box.

783
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,690
You're just going to disappear.
And this is all allegedly,

784
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:10,100
I don't remember what exactly.

785
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,540
I don't know what I know that
Sam said he wants to have,

786
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,990
he would have sex with Obama.

787
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:18,740
Well I think I'd have to be
mutual and I think that wrong.

788
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:23,330
Just trying to be funny and I don't think
he was successful. That's what I say.

789
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:28,100
I said it's just ridiculous. It's
actually the present. How dare you,

790
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,710
but it's okay to say having sex with
Bill Clinton right now, right? Yes. Yeah.

791
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,553
You can say,

792
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,860
you could say like if you're a girl,
like you'd look to,

793
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,270
you do whatever you want to start
Clinton's deck. Cause he likes that too.

794
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:42,920
But you don't get in trouble. You
don't think so? No. I think it's,

795
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,370
everybody just keeps it on the hush hush.

796
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,370
Now they know what happens when
it gets out. You don't want that.

797
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,290
You don't want to be Lewinski
skiing nettle. Right? Yeah.
That's so crazy. Like,

798
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,290
even today, like you say her name and
I was like, oh, come on the dress.

799
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,660
Boom, Sherlock lock, boom.
What a nutty time man.

800
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:05,730
What a strange time in our world where
everything got so desensitized that

801
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,880
everyone in the world was able to get the
information that there was calm on the

802
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:17,170
dress and that she sucked on his cock.
Like there was no question.

803
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:21,310
So everybody talked about the whole
country, the whole country. So she sucked.

804
00:45:21,311 --> 00:45:23,380
His cock can come in the dress.
She shucked with God.

805
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,620
I mean it was a national dialogue the
first time ever that any distinct sexual

806
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:32,290
act between someone of royalty,

807
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:37,470
a president of United States of America
was even engaging with some sort of sex.

808
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:42,550
But outside of his marriage and with a
20 year old chicken just works there.

809
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:46,780
Oh my God, he's a look. Stir
like this isn't a guy in a band.

810
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,210
This is the fucking
president United States.

811
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,740
And he's going like straight Mick
Jagger on this chick. That's,

812
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,700
that's incredible, right? If you
really stop and think about it.

813
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,000
Yeah, I, you know, it's funny, I never
thought of it like that, but it really is.

814
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:03,690
It's like that's the basis
from Boston has that story.

815
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:09,670
Yeah, exactly. The basis from Basel.
It's perfect. That's perfect feed.

816
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,620
Yeah, man, we, our whole world
changed. It was like, okay, okay, okay,

817
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,640
what is really going on?
And people don't give a fuck really.

818
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:21,930
Well they didn't because he was doing a
good job as a president and they're like,

819
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,470
well listen,
everybody heard the stories about John F.

820
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,860
Kennedy and how about the most of these
guys? In order to get to that position,

821
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:30,600
you've got gotta be some kind of a freak.

822
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:34,020
You gotta be some kind of a crazy guy
that wants to be at the head and the

823
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,570
leader,
even if it's for the right reasons.

824
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:39,150
Even if it's like with complete

825
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,300
good justice and grace and you're doing
all the right way to get to the very top

826
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,690
to very activity, too many tippity
top, you gotta be a little crazy.

827
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:49,853
You just got to,

828
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,300
you got to be to even want to be there
to even want to be the guy runs shit.

829
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,150
You've got to be to be the guy who says,
I know there's 300 million people,

830
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:02,151
but everybody sit the fuck down because
I'm going to talk now only me to 300

831
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,260
million and I'm your leader.
I'm the leader. I'm the
leader of 300 million people.

832
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,830
Are you talking about
how was that possible?

833
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,140
This is a crazy position to be in.

834
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,380
You have to be a crazy person
to acquire that position.

835
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:17,790
You have to be crazy to chase it.

836
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,160
Yeah. I mean if you heard
any of your friends be like,

837
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,620
I want to lead 300 million people,
they'd be like,

838
00:47:22,621 --> 00:47:26,370
you're a fucking psychotic narcissist.
You'd be out of your fucking mind.

839
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,840
Get outta here.
Stupid.

840
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:29,980
It just,

841
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,980
it's almost like the job only exists
for people who are like real live

842
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:39,610
superheroes who are really going to
try to change the world and people are

843
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:43,600
completely full of shit. Like that's it.
It's the only caught selling room. It's,

844
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:46,720
there's no room for anything else. There
is now a lot of middle there. It's like,

845
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,750
it's like people who aren't even a
real person, they just go in and they,

846
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:53,860
you know, that game that you play, we
try to almost touch hands, you know,

847
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:55,330
he tried to like see like back.

848
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:59,710
I would try to see how much you can
keep it together. Like how crows close,

849
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,890
you can get an anticipate each other's
movements. That's what they're doing.

850
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,670
But their particular line
steppers that's what's going on.

851
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:13,240
Yeah, that's it. It's just takes a
huge ego. Yeah. You've got to be crazy.

852
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:18,280
Yeah. That the idea that you're going
to run that whole giant mass of humans,

853
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,110
that's nuts.

854
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:24,880
You gotta be fucking crazy to even
attempt that because even the dumbest

855
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:28,540
smallest decision you make every
day affects tons of people.

856
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,300
Will they all go gray
like almost instantly,

857
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:36,400
the first couple of weeks they're
like, oh, the fucking pressure of,

858
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:36,790
you know,

859
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,750
saluting people and you're end up fucking
air force one and you're flying around

860
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,400
the world and you realize the reality
of what's really happening. You know,

861
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,590
and you hear the body counts and you,

862
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,560
you hear the numbers counts that how
much money and the defense contractor

863
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:55,120
budgets and this fucking craziness and
that craziness and they're using drones

864
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:59,230
and now you got to go on TV and pretend
Osama bin Ladin just got killed.

865
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,150
You know, they didn't girls all
by law and just shut the fuck up.

866
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,610
The guy had been dead forever. That was,
that was one of the dumbest things ever

867
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,150
drowned him. He really, really,

868
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,430
we got no pictures just because we don't
want them to know. We really think that,

869
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,410
yeah,
I don't believe it.

870
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,810
I say horse shall you always believed
the opposite. I say shitty things,

871
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,210
but that one, that one, I say horse shit.

872
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,420
The reason why I say horseshit is because
there was so many people that were

873
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:32,950
saying that guy was dead already.

874
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:36,340
There were saying that he was under going
dialysis. They're saying, right. Yeah,

875
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:37,630
like a big fucking kidney man.

876
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,800
And then there's other people
that have said this photos, they,

877
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,481
they're using that.

878
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:45,370
They say there's a one video of the guy
watching television in his apartment and

879
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:49,630
it's like, oh, it looks like it's a song
been lawn. They're saying, no, no, no.

880
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:52,660
That's my friend. I know this
guy, this guy, he looks like him.

881
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:55,870
Everybody looks like him. When they get
to be a certain age, you know, I mean,

882
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,470
they all look like Osama bin Ladin
at a certain age. We get crazy beers.

883
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:00,380
It's like,
you know,

884
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,010
that's just a certain look and there's
not a lot of distinct features in a

885
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:07,930
fucking giant beard. That's
when, when I have my own beard,

886
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,480
when I grow my beard out,
it covers your whole face.

887
00:50:10,481 --> 00:50:14,510
It's like this big crazy mass of hair
and everybody with a big crazy massive

888
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:18,850
hair looks pretty fucking similar. You
know, just most of it's just crazy hair.

889
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,100
So he's like, this is not though
some, I've been loving this.

890
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:24,910
She's my friend and not him.
It wasn't his house the other day.

891
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,100
I don't know if they really did,
but I think that would be

892
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,980
a story that if I, if I, you know,

893
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,860
wanted to release the frack
that Osama bin Laden was dead,

894
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:38,510
I would hold onto it for awhile and
then I pretend maybe they needed,

895
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,180
they needed to shoot one of the people
there that were not supposed to be

896
00:50:41,181 --> 00:50:43,940
shooting. Maybe that was, that's
what was going on. And then they,

897
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:46,390
then they were like,
oh, we got him. Maybe,

898
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,180
maybe they were just testing out
some new fucking ways to Jack People.

899
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:55,100
They went awry, you know, they crashed
a helicopter. They were like, look,

900
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:59,790
we've got some good news and bad news.
The bad news is we crashed a helicopter.

901
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,920
It good as it is. We just
killed Osama bin. Ladin me.

902
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:05,270
Well they had that dude on ice.
They were waiting like we need,

903
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,810
we need a time when we're going to break
out this and just use it as I get out

904
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:12,130
of jail free pass.
It's got like a special button.

905
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,930
He pitches and then they fucking,
they open up the freezer,

906
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,290
bring out this frozen popsicle,

907
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:22,430
Osama bin Ladin and it takes some
pictures with him. Come on man.

908
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,960
And then they throw him in the water. All.
Okay, cool. Yep. All right. I believe you.

909
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,030
You don't have to show me anything.
That was the weirdest thing.

910
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,100
That was the weirdest thing to me.

911
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:35,030
It was just like they went through this
crazy thing of like searching for years

912
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:37,960
and years and years, but then
they're like, you know what?

913
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,350
We got to get him in the water.
Like now what,

914
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,350
what was really frightening to me was a,

915
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,440
when all the people were cheering like
on the streets in like DC near the

916
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:52,670
Capitol and they were going Jew who has
hey. And I was walking and I was like,

917
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:55,400
wow, how many of those people are
getting paid to do that? First of all,

918
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,910
is it a little like professional
cheerleaders that they
brought in from like the

919
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,130
most communist schools?
Possibility to accent them in.

920
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:07,330
Got Everybody fired up about
you say you say it's ridiculous.

921
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,590
It was packed. And the funny thing
is like they would, they would,

922
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,520
they wanted to show it like on CNN stuff,

923
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:17,120
but then every once in a while it'd
be like the most drunk frat dude ever.

924
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:20,150
Like come up and look
just like deviled bird.

925
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:24,610
But the camera Justin in your
pharmacy, sorry, it becomes a,

926
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:29,990
you know, a cultural event, you know,
it's one of those whatever you, yeah,

927
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:34,190
it's like the, you know, the
death of our enemy. That's a huge,

928
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,370
it's a huge ticket to pull out. We're
going to say nothing. Nothing at all.

929
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,480
I was just wondering who do you think
killed Biggie? I, you know what?

930
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,690
I think he's alive and two POCs
alive and they live in Sweden.

931
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:52,610
I liked the way you think, dude. Logic
reason you putting it all together.

932
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,970
Um, you are, you, are you like
politically active at all?

933
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:03,971
Like do you look at this Obama
and Mitt Romney election and yeah,

934
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:07,400
I mean like, you know, I
have like my views on it.

935
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:11,780
I always think like I'm
never like informed enough
to like engage with like if

936
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:14,600
somebody gets like crazy then I'm
like damn, we're always talking about

937
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,850
the defense contractor
started this situation but
80 follow your mother fucker.

938
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,090
What's a sport? The biggest thing
I find like creepy is like, uh, a

939
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,860
Romney just kind of reminds me
of one of those guys who's like,

940
00:53:28,861 --> 00:53:33,000
just like son you a mattress that just
like, yeah, you'll love it. And I'm like,

941
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,630
anything you want to hear, he'll
tell you. So I'm always like, ah,

942
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,980
he almost has no shot.

943
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,880
He almost has no shot because of the fact
that it's going to come out when they

944
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:47,090
start the debates and the real rhetoric
and hate starts flying when it gets

945
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,590
closer and closer to November.
His Dad was born on a fucking farm.

946
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:54,990
Like a,
like a cult in Mexico.

947
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:59,300
Yeah. Yeah, I know. That's so crazy.
Cause I had read that and then I was like,

948
00:53:59,301 --> 00:54:02,060
why isn't that out? And I'm like the
first one that told us about this, Brian,

949
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,520
was it Bolelli Daniel Bell. Ella. Yeah.

950
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:09,040
Danieli Bolelli Elliot was telling
us about doubt that um, it's,

951
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,520
they have these places where they decided
they wanted to keep polygamy going.

952
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:17,410
So they moved to Mexico, set up shop.
They had whole communities in Mexico.

953
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:22,390
Yeah. And that's where Mitt Romney's dad
was born. It's crazy. And just the other,

954
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,360
the other day he was just
like, he was like, listen man,

955
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,890
who was talking to this crowd?
It's like my dad's from Mexico.

956
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:31,210
Like I understand where you guys are
coming from sort of thinking like,

957
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:35,170
I bet your experiences a little different.
Yeah.

958
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,740
You're out there with fucking Pedro
pound and corn into flour tortillas.

959
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,300
Fuck Outta here bitch.

960
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,700
You live in on a crazy farm
where everybody gets to
fuck hundred women. Yeah.

961
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,830
He wasn't working. I'm
fucking Makina Dora. I mean,

962
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,660
I mean we're not hating man.
You know,

963
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:58,280
I think it's a ballsy ass move to move
to another country and set up shop.

964
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,070
You know, that's what the,
the Mormon society to do.
That's a ballsy fuckin move.

965
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,440
Imagine how much you must like having
three wives to be like, fuck it,

966
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:10,610
I'm moving to Mexico.
That's fucking bull.

967
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:12,500
That's the old way,
the old way,

968
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,770
they can't take away the gods way here.

969
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,950
It is written just so really it's,
it's,

970
00:55:18,951 --> 00:55:21,770
that's the one that's so
obviously showing it's pimp hand.

971
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,760
Whenever you get like the, I won five
wives or unlimited about a wise man.

972
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:29,100
Come on man. What's really
going on? He shows his pimp

973
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,151
ever like I,

974
00:55:31,151 --> 00:55:34,750
I've thought about it many times having
the mammary love to have like a Harem,

975
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:38,010
you know like the way the, the salt
and her Brunei allegedly rocks it.

976
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,470
I always found that to be
the most fascinating cause
he's not married to any of

977
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,190
those. No, he has apparently this,

978
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:49,050
you know when you talk about like Forbes
500 or who's like got the most money,

979
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,510
I don't even think they
include royal families.

980
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:56,010
I think like these guys have like
unreported income. I think they're,

981
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:56,844
they're like,

982
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,880
they're beyond our calculations of what's
possible when it comes to wealth and

983
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:05,430
what I've heard some people do that
have like this kind of money. Let's, no,

984
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:06,930
let's not say any names at all.

985
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:11,550
I heard that they will go and pay
like the hottest women on the planet.

986
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:13,080
Let girls were like professional models.

987
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:18,060
They just pay them insane amounts of money
like any girl, really beautiful girls.

988
00:56:18,061 --> 00:56:22,530
And it may be have posed nude somewhere
and just he'll find them and to just say

989
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:26,350
offer to them, they offer them crazy
money and so they have to do it. They all,

990
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:27,280
they feel like they have to do it.

991
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:30,430
And the next thing you know that go there
and they're are part of like a disco.

992
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:34,810
The guy has his own private disco
and so it's fucking bad ass too.

993
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:37,210
Cause you're talking about someone
with insane amounts of money,

994
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:40,540
like insane wealth.
Everything is gold gilded.

995
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:44,820
Perfect craftsman ship the finest food.
Yeah, I thought the most battle Ram. Yeah.

996
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,830
And he goes down there and it's just him

997
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,150
and he's the guy you know is
gold underwear on and he's
moving through the crowd

998
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:59,140
and he's paid all of these women
essentially to have sex with him at his

999
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:03,280
choosing whenever he likes, when
he ever, he likes, he just chooses.

1000
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:07,750
So you might fly there and never fuck
him. Yeah. Yeah. He might not like you.

1001
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,650
He might not be into that.

1002
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:12,700
He just wants a bunch of them there
that are unbelievably hot and you know,

1003
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,390
depending on who you listen to or which
different dude who was rocking it this

1004
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,580
way,
you know they would do,

1005
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:21,280
would have like 30 women just waiting
and they're like Penn House pets.

1006
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,160
They're like fucking
like legit hot models,

1007
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:29,440
not the top of the food.
I wish a wish that man would write a book.

1008
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:33,880
You know, just like you want
to talk about being a baller.

1009
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,760
I mean if that kind of wrote a book,
they be like,

1010
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:40,300
that's so let me tell you how I
rock it has the name of his book.

1011
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:43,720
Let me tell you how the
discount that chapter one,

1012
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,090
this is what you would do if you had,
you know,

1013
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,550
a fucking trillion dollars
or whatever this guy has.

1014
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,500
He's like to pay them a half a million
dollars a year is nothing. It's nothing.

1015
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:58,090
I was reading this thing that
said like Vladimir Putin had like,

1016
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:02,950
he just collected a bunch of hot chicks
and had him play like horse polo naked

1017
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,910
and he was like, I'll, I wish you all
to play horse club, but just naked.

1018
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:08,950
He's an animal.

1019
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,570
You don't get to be a guy like food
unless you've been a part of some shit.

1020
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:18,330
You been a part of some shit. That's
a manly man. He's a scary dude now.

1021
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,370
He doesn't give a fuck. You Imagine
Putin was mad at you for some shit.

1022
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:24,880
How fucking tripping. That would
be. How terrifying that would be.

1023
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,410
You have to go to the other
side of the world. Yeah,

1024
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:31,730
you gotta you gotta move
to the Philippines, come
a kickboxer or something.

1025
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,350
He kind of fuck you better run bitch.

1026
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,550
You don't want to be hanging around
with that guy's mad at, you know, he,

1027
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:42,400
he probably, I mean he got to where
he was just like straight bully power.

1028
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,880
I don't know what he did,
but he scares the shit out of me.

1029
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:51,540
I remember Matt Damon had a really
interesting interview where he was talking

1030
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,770
about Sarah Pailin and a Matt Damon.
Damon is very astute,

1031
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,360
politically, very, very well read guy too,
like surprisingly intelligent. You know,

1032
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:03,790
you see him in movies,
you think he's always a really good actor,

1033
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:04,990
but then you hear him
talk and you're like,

1034
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:07,720
this guy's very bright and very well read.

1035
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:12,580
And he had this great analogy about
Sarah Pailin being like a Disney movie.

1036
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,630
And then all of the sudden this woman,
you know with her, her Moxie is going to,

1037
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:21,230
you know, stand up to the evil Russians,
you know? And he was like, you know,

1038
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:23,090
I need to, and he was
saying like, I need to know,

1039
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:26,000
does she really think the earth is
less than 10,000 years old? I really,

1040
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:30,590
I need to know this. I was
like, fuck yeah, yeah man. Yeah,

1041
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:32,390
you do need to know.
We all need to know that

1042
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,510
that changes some decisions
20,000 years ago. Nothing.

1043
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,010
There's a lot of people that still
think that that's the new earth.

1044
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,860
I D I mean we're talking
about millions of people.

1045
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,820
I know there's a lot of people that you
might be tens of millions that believe

1046
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:49,654
that

1047
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,850
when do you start believing
that I wasn't her?

1048
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:55,450
Like does it change your
decision making on everything?

1049
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:59,880
Yeah. Yeah. There's so god
it up. It's just such a,

1050
00:59:59,881 --> 01:00:03,480
it's such an extreme like belief to,

1051
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,990
to be that God it up. It's one thing
to have an idea that, you know,

1052
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,980
there's some sort of feels like there's
a forest to controls the universe.

1053
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:15,390
Maybe there's a gold were all attending
to, maybe there's, maybe there's a, uh,

1054
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,740
a next wave of understanding after this
is over and just like a psychedelic

1055
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:24,200
experience. It'll all make sense.
Maybe. Maybe, maybe, maybe, but,

1056
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,370
but your idea is crazy.

1057
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,960
Your idea about a fucking
dude in the cloud and,

1058
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:35,370
and he died and he came back from the dead
and what the fuck are you saying, man?

1059
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:39,540
Have you seen the,
the creation museum out here and uh,

1060
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:43,410
and in Pomona? No, I did not know
it was, there was one in Pomona.

1061
01:00:43,411 --> 01:00:45,780
I was going to go to the one that's on
the other side of the country. Yeah,

1062
01:00:45,781 --> 01:00:48,580
like Kentucky. Yes. It's
supposed to be amazing, dude.

1063
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:51,440
There's one out here. It's not as good
as the one over there, but it's like,

1064
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:55,730
it's pretty decent size. You gotta write
this down. It's there for a decent sized,

1065
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,570
and it's like a,
it's like Jesus riding dinosaur.

1066
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,310
Oh No. It does not have Jesus.
Right. Jesus riding a dinosaur,

1067
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:07,750
like a whole sculpture. It's
like Jesus Riding, uh, you know,

1068
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,550
a raptor and it's in Pomona.

1069
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,670
Yeah. It's like, it's like Audis here.
I think it's been promoted. Right.

1070
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:17,600
How many people are going to see
that? Like as a goof? Is it most,

1071
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:20,240
you know, when I was there, it
did not seem like I was like,

1072
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:23,540
me and a couple people were there as a
goof and then it seemed like everybody

1073
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:28,460
else was like, Kinda into it and it
was like, they were like, ah, you know,

1074
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:33,050
it was like a nonprofit organization just
about like Jesus riding dinosaurs and

1075
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:37,380
shit. It was weird. It was a four
year. Wow. That's so crazy, man. Yeah,

1076
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,970
it was people who were into it, man, they
were like, fuck yeah. Jesus rode that

1077
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,920
Jesus rode dinosaurs.
How dare you.

1078
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:50,400
Yeah, I liked it. They were like, because
at first before there was dinosaur bones,

1079
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:54,060
they were just like, you know, no pro
labor, like Jesus lives, blah, blah, blah.

1080
01:01:54,061 --> 01:01:56,820
Then the dinosaur bones came and they
needed to come up with an answer,

1081
01:01:56,821 --> 01:01:58,590
so I liked that they went with like,
yeah,

1082
01:01:58,591 --> 01:02:03,360
Jesus just like wrote them so I
would have gone with something else,

1083
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:06,420
like maybe Jesus was scared of him,
kept him over in a pan or something.

1084
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,520
Then the whole young earth
theory so spooky. It's, it just,

1085
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:12,220
it's so weird that you can get people
to believe something like that.

1086
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:16,510
It's so weird that no matter how many
scientists who have these elaborate

1087
01:02:16,511 --> 01:02:21,511
descriptions of how the earth cooled over
billions of and matter changed and the

1088
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:25,950
atmosphere changed and different forms
of life and there were mass extinctions

1089
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:29,850
and here's the fossil
record. No, not buying it.

1090
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:32,580
No Horse Shit,
bad science.

1091
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:37,800
I have a book written by people who swear
that the world is flat and the sun is

1092
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:42,030
17 miles away.
I'm going to let that one influenced me.

1093
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:46,600
I think it all stems from just
people being freaked out about dying.

1094
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,980
Oh yeah. For sure. That's a
big part of it, man. It's,
you need something, you know,

1095
01:02:50,981 --> 01:02:54,490
look, I have a four year old daughter
who's just started to ask questions like,

1096
01:02:54,491 --> 01:02:56,920
what happens when you die? You
know, and that's what they,

1097
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,240
they start thinking and it's a scary
idea for a little kid and it's, you know,

1098
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:07,090
the idea of a heaven and God is a
very comforting one for, for people.

1099
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,970
It's almost like,
even if it doesn't exist,

1100
01:03:09,971 --> 01:03:14,971
it's a very useful tool
because it actually does
provide people with a feeling

1101
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:17,020
of relief, you know,
if you can, it's like,

1102
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:20,680
it's almost like if you can
suspend disbelief for a movie,

1103
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:23,260
you could suspend the little pudge,
Jesus,

1104
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:27,970
and just kind of go along with it and
it'll provide you with like a framework

1105
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:30,940
where you can, you know,
you can make sense of life.

1106
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,990
It'll carry you to whatever
the fuck it is when it ends.

1107
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,910
So what are you, what do you tell her
that it's a very interesting conversation.

1108
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,293
Um,
I,

1109
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:46,580
I tell her that no one knows what
happens when we die and that some people

1110
01:03:47,321 --> 01:03:48,580
believe that you go to heaven.

1111
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:54,440
And then we discussed what would
heaven B and then I said, you know,

1112
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:59,460
no one really knows what happens but
people hope that you go somewhere and

1113
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,830
everything is beautiful and perfect.
So my wife has explained this,

1114
01:04:05,831 --> 01:04:09,550
that there, and as, as she becomes more
and more frantic about who's going to die,

1115
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,380
it becomes more and more ridiculous.

1116
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:14,950
Why keep not having you get whatever
you want. Yeah. TV You can watch.

1117
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:18,640
It starts off as like a rational sort
of conversation and then I realized,

1118
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:20,890
what am I doing?
She's for like,

1119
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:25,420
this is like a fucking serious concept
to try to digest for four year old.

1120
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:29,950
And I'm like, let's go over the
potentials for what happened would be,

1121
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,810
that seems like a better way.

1122
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,490
Direction. It just said she
become a star and then like,

1123
01:04:33,491 --> 01:04:36,740
you know when you're 13 just go, hey,
you know that star Shit. You're not,

1124
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:40,690
you gotta wait til they're 13 and by
then she'll be pregnant. Brian. Okay.

1125
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:44,500
You gotta talk to them before
they're 30 Brian's like till like,

1126
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:45,850
it's like having a plan.

1127
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,650
You just water it when it's young and
then leave it in the sun for a while and

1128
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,060
13 he can't tell a 13 year old.

1129
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,470
That's fucking crazy shit that I told
you it wasn't real. There's no answer.

1130
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:57,700
There's no answer.

1131
01:04:57,701 --> 01:05:00,820
So just say it's a star and
let her believe that and
they shall become a hippie.

1132
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:04,690
That's funny. My Dad, I remember
my dad when I asked him that,

1133
01:05:04,691 --> 01:05:08,830
my dad said I was just a
little kid and he was like, ah,

1134
01:05:08,831 --> 01:05:10,060
it's just darkness

1135
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:11,700
forever.
Whoa.

1136
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:15,180
Yeah. And I was like, whoa.
That's what my mom told me.

1137
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:18,190
I was like traumatized by it.
And I went to,

1138
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,560
and I remember going into my
mom's room and being like,

1139
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:24,070
do dads just statute said and it was dark.
Right? And she's like, he doesn't know.

1140
01:05:24,071 --> 01:05:27,190
And she's like, Sam coming in here and
tell me it doesn't, you don't know.

1141
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,980
Nobody knows. He's like, I know that's
what it is. It's darkness forever.

1142
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:34,650
And then you have the role
play.

1143
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,560
That's hilarious. Yeah.
I think my mom said,

1144
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:40,980
you just go to sleep
and you just don't wake

1145
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:45,930
go. My stepfather told me
probably nothing. So you probably,

1146
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,910
you know,
he was the one when I was seven years old,

1147
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:49,140
when I started asking these questions,

1148
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,100
I was really religious until my
parents got divorced. And uh,

1149
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,640
I went to Catholic school for a
year and Catholics code is wrong.

1150
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:00,210
The religion out of me, I had
no, I was like, this is crazy.

1151
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:05,240
Total 100% horse shit. And then, um, uh,

1152
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,490
uh, a year later we had the
conversation like, what? Well,

1153
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:13,590
if that's not real, if this Jesus Moses
Shit is something somebody made up,

1154
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,730
then what happens when you die? And he
was like, oh, it's probably nothing.

1155
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,540
Probably just sentence,
dude.

1156
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:25,080
I can't remember crying that hard
when I was like a little kid,

1157
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:27,330
you know,
just lying in my bed.

1158
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,300
Ooh.
Just the terrifying notion that somehow,

1159
01:06:32,301 --> 01:06:36,610
and none of this was going to end and they
would just stomp. Yeah. It's so weird.

1160
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:40,510
The same with me. I was like, I would
get like panic attacks thinking about it.

1161
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:42,780
I'd just be like, what do
you mean forever? Yeah.

1162
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:47,650
What the fuck is forever in the darkness?
I know. What the fuck does that mean?

1163
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,420
It's weird that everybody
loves going asleep.

1164
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:54,250
You know people love going to sleep
because you know you get to wake up,

1165
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:54,571
you know,

1166
01:06:54,571 --> 01:06:59,170
so you're willing to like stop for a
while cause you know you'll come back but

1167
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:03,760
nobody wants to die. Not
that. My buddies, my buddies,

1168
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:08,440
a paramedic and he told me that he had
this call the other day and it's like 95

1169
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:13,180
year old dude who was like riddled with
cancer hat instead of having a do not

1170
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:16,750
resuscitate. He was, it was like full,
it was like bring me back full code.

1171
01:07:16,751 --> 01:07:20,200
Like anything that happens pretty man.
I'm like dude that bummed me out so much.

1172
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:20,621
Cause I'm like,

1173
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:24,880
if a 95 year old dude who's like
riddled with cancer isn't ready to die,

1174
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:28,630
like I want to be so fucking freaked
out at all. The bad guy's like, Nah,

1175
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:31,480
I don't want to go. Some people
are afraid of everything, you know.

1176
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,090
But death is something that
everybody's afraid of them.

1177
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:35,460
And if you're not,

1178
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,630
it's probably life is miserable for you
to the point where death is favorable.

1179
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:43,920
Yeah, he must be sick. Something's
wrong. There's an imbalance,

1180
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:47,910
whether it's a behavioral and bounce or
a societal and balance, whether you know,

1181
01:07:47,911 --> 01:07:50,820
somebody did you wrong to the point
where you, it broke your brain.

1182
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,290
I don't know what the fuck it is,

1183
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:54,730
but if you really want to end it
for yourself and that's it, it's a

1184
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,670
terrible place to be
than that and that like,

1185
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,570
like I'm not really afraid to die like I,

1186
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,970
because I have Jesus in
my heart and all that.

1187
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,470
No, but I mean, no, I'm not. I'm not.
I think that it's because of mushrooms.

1188
01:08:08,471 --> 01:08:12,280
I've had so many where I thought I was
dying and I, I was like, you know what?

1189
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:15,830
This is, this has been good
and blah, blah, blah. And
I'm like, oh wait, I die. Oh

1190
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:16,620
yeah.

1191
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:21,620
It would be awesome if there was
something that you could believe so

1192
01:08:21,961 --> 01:08:24,090
wholeheartedly that it calmed
you down and you're like, well,

1193
01:08:24,091 --> 01:08:28,080
I'm not worried about it. If it ends,
we're fine. We just go to this. Just like,

1194
01:08:28,081 --> 01:08:29,460
you're not worried about going to sleep,

1195
01:08:29,461 --> 01:08:31,470
you're not worried we're going to go on
asleep cause you know you're gonna wake

1196
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:33,690
up. I know where I'm never worried
about going to sleep. I'm like,

1197
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:38,360
Oh let me go to sleep problem. It's
great. I wake up beautiful. If,

1198
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:43,680
if we had the information that we have
about coming back like we have about

1199
01:08:43,681 --> 01:08:46,020
sleep, you know, maybe it's just

1200
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:49,010
then people saw the things you think.

1201
01:08:49,011 --> 01:08:53,460
So I think if people knew like once you
died it was like fucking shaking an acid,

1202
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,333
etch a sketch.

1203
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:58,820
People would do really fucked out things.
I would hope not.

1204
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:02,120
I would hope the opposite.
I would hope if they,

1205
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:05,990
if that first of all would freak people
out just to know that you definitely

1206
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:10,580
would come back. That would just be such
a trip. It'd be so scared to try again.

1207
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:11,690
Yeah,
that's true.

1208
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,980
And also like what if you came back
and they fucking terrible situation.

1209
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:19,700
What if you were like a spoiled Twat?
You know, living on long island,

1210
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:25,500
it's just balling out of control in
a mansion and then you come back in.

1211
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:29,360
You're in new Uganda. Yeah. You're in the
jungle and you're gonna. You have aids.

1212
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:32,240
You have a big bloated belly
like that could be you too.

1213
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,940
You got just some crazy lucky role.

1214
01:09:34,941 --> 01:09:39,941
The DNA dice that you're here in
America in 2012 just that alone.

1215
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:44,000
You want to try this again? You
get a, you're going to play fair.

1216
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,550
You're going to take any
spot all over the globe.

1217
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:49,600
Like what do you come back [inaudible]
come back as you are you doing?

1218
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,970
You are on the same trip every time
trying to get it right. Is that it?

1219
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,970
Yeah. Like if we're going odds, you're
like in some fucking tiny town in China.

1220
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:01,970
It's like drinking water, drinking
water from like no puddles. Yeah.

1221
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:05,370
Warm Brown puddles of
water that people step in.

1222
01:10:05,371 --> 01:10:08,960
That's where you're getting
your water. Fuck man. Yeah.

1223
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:11,580
There's a lot of spots on
the earth that are just shit.

1224
01:10:11,581 --> 01:10:16,500
Roll the dice to be there,
man. Big Time. We're lucky.

1225
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,230
Southern California. So lucky. It's
delusional. It's good. I could live.

1226
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:24,480
Weather here is so incredible all the
time that no one ever has to deal with

1227
01:10:24,481 --> 01:10:28,340
nature. There's no storms to
stay indoors from, you know,

1228
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:32,400
this snow shoveling of the streets,
you know, getting the snow out or

1229
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:35,000
no,
just a giant astronauts asteroid of a,

1230
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:38,290
an earthquake that's coming towards
that we all know is going to happen.

1231
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:43,700
They're going to die. Well, I mean, like,
we know that there's a ticking time bomb.

1232
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:47,780
I, it could make a big deal because I
grew up in San Diego and you don't give a

1233
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:50,720
fuck about anything when you grow up in
like, the weather's perfect and like,

1234
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:54,140
yeah, you get an earthquake every now and
then, but like a little bit of shaking.

1235
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:56,570
I like every two years.
Look at Japan.

1236
01:10:56,571 --> 01:11:00,350
Just look at the recent tragedies
lately that just destroyed. I mean,

1237
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,790
Tokyo is pretty much gone like that,

1238
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,990
that I don't know if they
would ever recover. They, they,

1239
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,410
that country as a whole is pretty much
fucked and they don't want to talk about

1240
01:11:09,411 --> 01:11:11,670
it, but it's pretty
much these gone, right?

1241
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,950
Um,
I don't eat mean

1242
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,890
economically. The Fukushima
areas. Fuck yeah. The,

1243
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,820
the area where the meltdown happened,
right.

1244
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:21,830
They're already seeing mutated animals.
Shit.

1245
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:26,720
Bonnie's born with no arms or ears or
weird shit is going on at red and going

1246
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:28,920
just going to San Diego.
You go by that naked gun,

1247
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:32,860
huge tit reactor and he just like look
around there and like, oh shit. You know,

1248
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,370
it just takes one earthquake
and that shit's fucked. Yeah.

1249
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:38,060
Didn't you think about that
when you went by? Absolutely.

1250
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,650
Holy thought about that as we went by it.
I was doing by it.

1251
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:41,580
I looked at that thing.
I'm like,

1252
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:44,790
what a nutty place to put
this right next to the ocean.

1253
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:47,340
You fucking crazy insulin assholes.

1254
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,190
And you know why they put it right
next to the ocean. Shit goes wrong.

1255
01:11:50,191 --> 01:11:54,070
They can flood it with ocean water to
cool it off and and awesome and that water

1256
01:11:54,071 --> 01:11:56,580
goes right back in the ocean. Yeah.
That's what they did in Japan.

1257
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:00,540
They fucking poured millions of
gallons of ocean water on the,

1258
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:04,950
the actual inferno of hell and then they
pour that water right back in the ocean.

1259
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,040
It's unbelievably toxic.
I mean,

1260
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:10,980
it's fucking going to jack
everything and they're like,

1261
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:13,620
it's too what we gotta do. We gotta
do we gotta do it? Tough Shit.

1262
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:17,610
So everything gets checked on it there
that you need millions of gallons that,

1263
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:22,470
oh, she's a son, they made a son.
He'll be fine. It's a little baby son.

1264
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,300
I mean, and do you know what nuclear power
is? Did you know that it's just steam.

1265
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,080
They just did the nuclear heat,
you know that melts water,

1266
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:35,520
make steam and that powers all these
reactors. That's what that's like the,

1267
01:12:35,521 --> 01:12:38,590
that's that's the mechanism behind it.
Producing electricity.

1268
01:12:38,591 --> 01:12:40,710
No idea about any of that.
I have no idea either.

1269
01:12:40,711 --> 01:12:43,260
I just figured it was somehow or another
they take that nuclear energy and they

1270
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:47,010
put it on a wire and it goes
to in your hairdryer? No,

1271
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:51,300
it's like it's the same sort of idea.
You know the force behind it.

1272
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:54,540
I think in the steam behind it is what,
what powers the generators.

1273
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,080
But it's essentially, it's a nuclear
reaction that they can't ever cool off.

1274
01:12:58,410 --> 01:13:03,310
You can't like can't shut it off.
Stupidest idea every if,

1275
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:06,240
if the fucking thing meant meltdown,
you're done.

1276
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,460
You just have to get away from it. You
can't cool it off. It does. That's like,

1277
01:13:11,461 --> 01:13:13,580
that's so nuts.
Like I,

1278
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:16,710
we can have wind power where we have the
windmill spinning or we can have this

1279
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:21,160
fucking thing that's impossible.
The cool this son that if it'd be,

1280
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:25,640
apparently they had a backup plan up
to like a certain amount of, you know,

1281
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:28,290
earthquake and this far exceeded that.

1282
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:32,250
This was like a really ridiculously
powerful earthquake and they lost their

1283
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:34,890
backup generator and so they
knew they had like eight hours.

1284
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,260
We've got eight hours to get the
fuck outta here. He can't fix it.

1285
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,900
Like what are you talking about?

1286
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:44,280
How arrogant are human beings that they
would make something where that could

1287
01:13:44,281 --> 01:13:48,510
even possibly ever happen and not
have any way you would say, okay,

1288
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:53,040
before we build it, do you guys really
know how to shut this off? Is there, okay.

1289
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:56,670
And what happens if that happens and what
happens to the power doesn't come back

1290
01:13:56,671 --> 01:14:01,140
on then what happens? Oh, then, oh,
then it just eats through the earth.

1291
01:14:01,141 --> 01:14:02,370
We don't know when it stops,

1292
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,660
it goes through the core and it just
keeps going and probably comes out of the

1293
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:10,380
other side or something.
The fuck they don't know.

1294
01:14:10,381 --> 01:14:14,320
It's never happened before that and
they went, okay, we'll build it.

1295
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:18,490
We'll say sounds good. Crazy.
Sounds good. Go build that.

1296
01:14:18,491 --> 01:14:20,500
How many guys want to build?
You want to be like a few hundred of them?

1297
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:23,530
Just leave them around. Yeah, let's
put them near fault lines and shit.

1298
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,750
So let's add some earthquakes to la.

1299
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:29,560
Let's add some earthquakes to all this
fucking people that we have here that's

1300
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:31,380
added to the nuclear shit.
That's attitude.

1301
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:34,060
The fact that we don't have
any water as less handling.

1302
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,350
We don't have any elect our
electricity. He's fucking gone, dude.

1303
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:41,710
We live in the dumbest place in the whole
entire roof. No, Vegas is the dumbest.

1304
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:45,730
This is the second. Second Dennis. Well at
least Vegas. I did a Fresno. Fresno fuck.

1305
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,690
It sucks. Yeah man. I've seen some spots.

1306
01:14:49,691 --> 01:14:53,320
It's suck a lot worse than Pasadena.
Yeah,

1307
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:56,590
well it's tricky, that's for sure.
We're, we're certainly susceptible.

1308
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,050
And the more they find
out, like, you know,

1309
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:02,110
the archeologists are constantly
uncovering these lost cities now.

1310
01:15:02,111 --> 01:15:05,500
Like they've found a few of them off
the coast of Spain and one of them they

1311
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,240
think might be Atlantis and they
found one recently that was like,

1312
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:13,270
it was underwater as
recently as 8,500 years ago.

1313
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,530
So this is like crazy old stuff,
you know, and it's, you know,

1314
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,420
old pottery and it's old,

1315
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:24,450
different fucking we're finding out that
like shit happens and goes wrong all

1316
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:26,560
the time on this planet.
You know,

1317
01:15:26,561 --> 01:15:30,390
it's always getting hit by rocks from
outer space and there's fucking volcanoes.

1318
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:35,290
The blow up every now and again and the
earth moves and giant thousand foot high

1319
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:38,530
tsunamis wipe out miles
in and then pull back.

1320
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:41,710
And that shit happens all the time
in history. You know, we just,

1321
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:42,760
for whatever reason,

1322
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:47,950
are willing to gamble that it's not gonna
it's not gonna happen on my watch. No.

1323
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:50,410
I mean basically that's what it is. Cause
it's eventually going to happen. Yeah.

1324
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:53,170
I mean it's an avoidable d we,
you know,

1325
01:15:53,171 --> 01:15:55,660
we've harped on it too
many times probably by now,

1326
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:58,180
but the just the asteroid number alone,

1327
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:01,960
when they find out how many hundreds
of thousands of asteroids are hovering

1328
01:16:01,961 --> 01:16:04,210
around inside of our solar
system and you're like,

1329
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:06,970
what the fuck are you talking
about? It's not like, oh,

1330
01:16:06,971 --> 01:16:08,530
I heard there's like a hundred asteroids.
No,

1331
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:13,531
there's like thousands of thousands and
thousands of these fucking things just

1332
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:19,090
flying around and one of them could
just call her Ghrelin towards us.

1333
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:24,180
We've been hit before many times and
most likely that's responsible for the,

1334
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:30,100
a bunch of different weird shit where
they finally these ancient civilizations

1335
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,500
and they don't understand how
they were sophisticated back then.

1336
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,640
It's by we've stacked up some progress
and been knocked down a few times.

1337
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,330
The very date of,
Oh,

1338
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,920
I think it's like they're like
a 12,500 years ago or something.

1339
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:45,760
Right now scientists are a growth is a
bunch of people over the country or over

1340
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:49,420
the world rather that are agreeing that
there was some sort of an impact that

1341
01:16:49,421 --> 01:16:51,940
happened then because they're
doing all their core samples,

1342
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:56,941
they find some sort of a glass that's
only created in like nuclear blasts or

1343
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:59,240
extreme impacts or you know,

1344
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:02,680
things along those lines like tongue
goose got like that kind of shit has to

1345
01:17:02,681 --> 01:17:03,250
happen.

1346
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:08,250
Like some crazy impact and they're finding
a lot of this shit at 12,500 years.

1347
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:12,770
So they think it's really possible that
we had like a massive meteor shower

1348
01:17:12,771 --> 01:17:16,540
12,500 years ago. It might
have fucked up, you know,

1349
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:19,400
50% of the cities of the world,
you know,

1350
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:22,870
but back then think about
12,500 years ago and didn't know

1351
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,910
how, how does that
information get to us if you,

1352
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,660
if every half the city's did get
jacked by these giant rock from space,

1353
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:36,110
who, how many people would remember
that story? What would that story be?

1354
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:39,770
By the time they figured out how
to make paper again. You know,

1355
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:43,670
I got to feel like if you were alive
for that, you got to remember that.

1356
01:17:43,671 --> 01:17:46,850
It's like, yeah, you remember the one
time we got hit with it? Yeah, I remember.

1357
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,700
I remember that.
What do you think they,

1358
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,220
the people that survived even
knew what the fuck happened.

1359
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,600
Cause maybe it was just like dumb luck.
You know,

1360
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:56,240
like they probably a bunch
of asteroids came down,

1361
01:17:56,241 --> 01:18:00,440
a meteor shower just fucked up.
Boom, boom, boom. Like maybe,

1362
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:02,660
maybe some places like
it just didn't hit them.

1363
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,610
And so those are the ones that survive.

1364
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:06,680
Then they had to go and look
at the rest of the world.

1365
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:10,700
That would be equally freaky to know
that it could happen to you any day.

1366
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:14,060
Do you get, if you lived in a
place where you didn't get hit,

1367
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:18,560
but you heard all these crazy noises in
the background, but you and your tribe,

1368
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,260
you guys are fucking cool,
no problems whatsoever.

1369
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:25,790
And then you venture forth and it's
like Lord of the rings everywhere.

1370
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,630
You look as burnt out and
smoking and like what the fuck?

1371
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:32,870
Everyone's dead.
Everywhere you go is just bodies.

1372
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,320
Just pieces of hands and
feet and fucking heads.

1373
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:40,900
Cause everybody got hit with giant rocks
from the sky and pulverized into but

1374
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:45,310
just she would groups of people smashed
on the highway with big rocks. Boom.

1375
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:50,980
That would be almost freakier than dying
to know that disk just happened a few

1376
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:53,660
hundred miles from you and you,
you know,

1377
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:56,990
you get on your horse and find
it and you see how nutty it is.

1378
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,410
You see how none of the damages and know
that that could happen at the sky can

1379
01:19:00,411 --> 01:19:05,000
just all of a sudden be
just a swarm of fiery rocks.

1380
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,870
Yes.
Especially like before science or any,

1381
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:12,860
anything to explain anything or God, I
feel like everything people saw back then,

1382
01:19:12,861 --> 01:19:15,980
they were like, what the fuck
is this? You Imagine? I mean,

1383
01:19:15,981 --> 01:19:19,970
how weird is it that w when
did we become so, so conscious?

1384
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:24,050
Like when did we become so aware of all
the possibilities in our environment?

1385
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:28,070
I mean it was a slow, gradual process
where the human brain evolved, right?

1386
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,280
It's not like we were always
this smart right from the get go.

1387
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:33,230
Somewhere along the
line it must have been,

1388
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,330
I mean that's probably what
religion is really all about.

1389
01:19:35,331 --> 01:19:38,120
It's probably like some sort of
psychic training wheels, you know,

1390
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:42,370
it's like you're not quite
ready to grasp the polled.

1391
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,370
None of us are.

1392
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:47,570
So it's like let's give you an ideology
to believe in that puts you on the right

1393
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:49,220
track.
Cause you know this,

1394
01:19:49,221 --> 01:19:53,090
this feeling of God and love
and everything that it's
totally the right way to

1395
01:19:53,091 --> 01:19:57,290
do it. It's totally the right way to live.
So how, how do you need to get there?

1396
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,230
Do you need to get there through yoga?
Well then you go yoga,

1397
01:20:00,231 --> 01:20:05,000
you go yoga and find that spot. Could is
the baby Jesus more you're liking? Yeah,

1398
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:09,960
like singing. I'm really good with groups.
Okay, go that way. He just, you know,

1399
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:14,190
it's like the psychic training wheels.
As we get through this, this weird spot,

1400
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:16,820
get through this weird spot,

1401
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:21,860
we start to awaken and see how fucking
crazy this world is and realize sometimes

1402
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:26,730
the sky becomes of a light with
flying rocks that are on fire.

1403
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,360
Fuck.
It's like

1404
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:33,260
nobody's going to stop that man.
If,

1405
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,300
if all of a sudden we got caught
a meteor shower, that's, well,

1406
01:20:36,301 --> 01:20:37,650
that's just what it is.

1407
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:41,140
Yeah. Well, yeah. Imagine you're there
and you see the flying rocks flying.

1408
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:46,030
First thing you'd be after you run
for your life, then you're like,

1409
01:20:46,031 --> 01:20:49,510
well obviously somebody threw that at me.
That's gigantic.

1410
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,790
Freshly back bends. Yeah.
That's how he back then. Oh,

1411
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:57,520
we're being attacked by God's
Haiti's cause I'm Braga, you know,

1412
01:20:57,521 --> 01:21:01,940
like you throw your a caveman or whatever
you throw shit, throw rocks is under.

1413
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,620
If that was like where the
origins of of Haiti's [inaudible]

1414
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,680
hell fire and all that shit came from,
I wonder if that was that, you know,

1415
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:14,160
you've gotta wonder like when, when did
they first figure out the idea of hell?

1416
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:18,630
Was it when they first saw
volcano? It makes sense. Yeah.

1417
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,690
If you for, if you were fucking
capers and you show a volcano,

1418
01:21:21,691 --> 01:21:25,260
hell totally makes sense. You're
like, you do not want to go there.

1419
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:28,440
You will fucking burn forever.
I mean, it looks like, yeah,

1420
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:32,550
you would burn forever if you could exist
and somehow or another not disappear

1421
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:36,900
instantly into the lava and just have
that feeling of being burned by lava

1422
01:21:36,901 --> 01:21:40,050
forever. Probably the most terrifying
thing a person could ever experience.

1423
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:43,300
Well, definitely. Imagine you
don't know it's 10,000 years ago.

1424
01:21:43,301 --> 01:21:44,470
You don't know anything about science.

1425
01:21:44,471 --> 01:21:48,670
You see a volcano erupt and then
some shit comes out of it that's just

1426
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:51,520
disintegrates everything in
its path. You're like, yeah,

1427
01:21:51,521 --> 01:21:54,430
that's probably the bad place.
Mark W,

1428
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:57,020
well, most people don't realize
is the Yellowstone volcano.

1429
01:21:57,021 --> 01:22:00,620
This is one of the biggest volcanoes in
the earth. It's a, it's a super volcano.

1430
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,650
Yellowstone is something
called a Caldera volcano,

1431
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:06,680
and they didn't even discover this
until I think like a decade ago.

1432
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:09,890
I think when they started using
satellites to map things out,

1433
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,190
they realize that it's a
crater and that Yellowstone,

1434
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:18,220
I think it's like 300 kilometers wide or
something crazy like that might be 600

1435
01:22:18,381 --> 01:22:23,060
kilometer. That'd be 300 miles. Yes. Not
only is it active, it's a super volcano,

1436
01:22:23,061 --> 01:22:27,140
which means it gets up to a
peak and then the peak explodes.

1437
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:32,060
The whole thing explodes and just
leaves behind a whole team. Yeah,

1438
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:36,680
it kills like a giant percentage of
everything in the continent because it's

1439
01:22:36,681 --> 01:22:40,040
such a huge volcano.
I mean it like,

1440
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:42,680
it becomes like almost like a
nuclear winter type situation.

1441
01:22:42,681 --> 01:22:46,230
I think it fills the sky with
ash. I mean, I think it's,

1442
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:50,360
it's such a massive volcano
that you really could call
it a continent killer and

1443
01:22:50,361 --> 01:22:54,800
it happens every six to 800,000 years
and the last time it happened was 600,000

1444
01:22:54,801 --> 01:22:57,740
years ago.
Yeah.

1445
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,610
So if that did happen and there's not
a goddamn thing we can do to stop it.

1446
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:06,250
If Yellowstone decided to blow and it
went called dare on us and fucking erupted

1447
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:09,970
on us. That's a wrap for
black. Most of the west coast,

1448
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:12,940
a huge chunk of the country.
I mean is, it's done, dude.

1449
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:15,940
It's a fucking horror movie.
It's the road.

1450
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:20,380
It's that movie Viggo Mortensen
it's that shit. It's that shit.

1451
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:24,310
That's the only time it's okay
to say you would fuck Obama. Yes.

1452
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:27,160
Then you can get away with anything,
then you can get away with anything.

1453
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:31,630
And Don might have happened in a let,
to a lesser extent to our ancestors.

1454
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,790
It's very possible that might have
happened. That might be with, you know,

1455
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:38,260
when they find all these crazy
structures and shit under the ocean,

1456
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,300
that might be what happened
is people might've got jack.
Yeah. You gotta imagine.

1457
01:23:42,301 --> 01:23:42,440
Yeah.

1458
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:45,020
Because it's also like, you
know, if that should happen,

1459
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:49,050
like seems like crazy shit
happens every like 50,000 years.

1460
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:51,850
Like it's got to happen.
Like you said, we've,

1461
01:23:51,851 --> 01:23:56,030
we've probably gone farther in technology
then, you know, two steps forward.

1462
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:56,710
One step back.
Yeah.

1463
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:01,660
Yeah. I agree. Yeah. You know, except
for when you look at, uh, uh, buildings,

1464
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:04,120
you know, some of the crazy
Egyptian buildings and shit. Like,

1465
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:05,240
how the fuck did they do that?
You know,

1466
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:07,990
if there really was an ancient
civilization and figured
out how to do that, like,

1467
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:11,260
well, they, they might've been ahead
of us, you know, I dunno. I mean,

1468
01:24:11,261 --> 01:24:13,420
that seems like in a lot of
ways it seems ahead of us.

1469
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:16,790
The construction methods that
the giant stones they moved like,

1470
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:20,230
but it's pretty clear that
everybody gets nailed, you know,

1471
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:24,710
it's just no way you can avoid it.
The little things like, you know, the,

1472
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:29,230
the tsunami that killed everyone and
Thailand, you know, that was t to us,

1473
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:31,300
it was a huge deal.
You know,

1474
01:24:31,301 --> 01:24:33,340
to us humans think about the
numbers in the body counts,

1475
01:24:33,341 --> 01:24:38,290
but to the world population, it's
nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing.

1476
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,513
It's,

1477
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:44,550
it's weird how many different things
like that could happen in mass scale,

1478
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:49,090
like frightening scale thousand mile,
you know,

1479
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:54,310
fucking, uh, I think it's 45,000
mile an hour. Asteroids. That's,

1480
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:57,100
that's like what the speed that most
of them are travel that, you know.

1481
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:59,500
And there could be a mile wide,
five miles wide.

1482
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,960
It's like,
it's crazy thing too.

1483
01:25:01,961 --> 01:25:04,750
Like even if you look at like
the plague as reading this,

1484
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:05,500
I was reading something,

1485
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,380
it's like it killed three
fifths of the people in Europe.

1486
01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:12,650
Like what if that happened now? Nice.
Like people would go, but like Thailand,

1487
01:25:12,651 --> 01:25:15,370
you know we go bananas at the Thailand
thing. It's such a small percentage.

1488
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:19,480
Like three out of five people in Europe.
Every three out of five people die.

1489
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,570
Well what,
what happened was it was the plague.

1490
01:25:22,571 --> 01:25:24,670
Something that was transmitted by rodents.
Yeah.

1491
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:28,780
Cause the fleas carried all of the plague
and then the rodents would get on the

1492
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:29,614
boats.

1493
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:34,360
They'd run a clock across the ropes that
get to the shore and then the fleets

1494
01:25:34,361 --> 01:25:38,020
would come out and bite people.
Oh Jesus Christ. Get everybody.

1495
01:25:38,021 --> 01:25:41,530
Then they end up at Applebee's.
Fucking

1496
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:45,640
Gary is the plague. Did you
know that a guy in um, uh,

1497
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,130
where the fuck was it that he got tested?

1498
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:51,460
A guy got bitten by an animal
and he got tested for the play.

1499
01:25:51,461 --> 01:25:55,720
I think it was a cat
and he tested positive for the plague.

1500
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:58,050
It was like it was in the
Pacific northwest. Okay.

1501
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:02,150
I want to say cause that there's been
a couple cases of the plague like in

1502
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,010
California.
Yeah.

1503
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:09,110
Fuck. You know that's like
some old school pirate shit.

1504
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:12,230
You hear the plague? Yeah. Yeah.
It's connected to boats, right?

1505
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:14,480
Like what the fuck man,
the plague really

1506
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:17,750
must've sucked.

1507
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:22,810
Fat Dick live in Baghdad for he fits
to the people die from the plague.

1508
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:27,860
Everybody's like stinky all the time.
Time. Yeah. A lot of rape going on.

1509
01:26:27,861 --> 01:26:32,861
Probably tons and probably people are
assholes who just dying and when people

1510
01:26:33,111 --> 01:26:37,100
died easier and quicker, they were
probably like way more conti. Right.

1511
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:39,130
They didn't last that long.

1512
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:42,590
They just fucking got all their content
and they probably were much more likely

1513
01:26:42,591 --> 01:26:45,530
to commit violence on each other.
They are probably much closer to animals.

1514
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:46,761
Oh yeah.

1515
01:26:46,761 --> 01:26:50,060
How far back do you think you can go and
still rocket seventies think you'd be

1516
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:55,050
happy in the 70s yeah, that'd be
having this, that can be happy.

1517
01:26:55,051 --> 01:26:57,680
In the 70s I would miss my phone now Matt.
A lot.

1518
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:01,520
I'd miss being able to call people and
we, it never made this interview, man.

1519
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:05,300
I never spoke a word to you
until we walked in the door
and said, hey, what's up?

1520
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:10,460
You know, it was all done through, you
know, texts and emails and all that jazz.

1521
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:14,030
It's kind of fascinating that it couldn't
have happened in the 70s even just

1522
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:14,560
like,
yeah.

1523
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,330
Have you ever like tried to go pick
somebody up at the airport and forgot your

1524
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:21,110
phone? Yeah. It's like you might as well
just turn around and go, oh yeah. Oh,

1525
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:23,930
it's so weird what we accept.
It's so weird.

1526
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:29,110
I could probably do the 60s but
no earlier sixties or interesting.

1527
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:32,470
You get some cool cars.
You could,

1528
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:37,010
you could be driving around
in a brand new 1964 Mustang.

1529
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,100
Holy Shit. And it would be real. You know,

1530
01:27:40,101 --> 01:27:43,870
like this is a fucking
real brand new 64 Mustang.

1531
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:48,470
You feel what it was like to have
one of those things back then.

1532
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:52,340
That might be fun. That might be fine.
You would know so much more than them.

1533
01:27:52,341 --> 01:27:55,940
It would be stealing. You could be
able to fuck every chicken meat.

1534
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:59,900
All you have to do is keep talking to him,
keep talking to him long enough.

1535
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:02,690
They'd be like, he's a prophet
ahead. I have to go with him.

1536
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:07,160
He has the answers that I seek.
You could totally start a call to be like,

1537
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:09,080
Fuck Charlie Manson.
Charlie, sit the fuck down.

1538
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:12,740
I'm gonna tell you some shit about the
future. This is what's going to happen.

1539
01:28:12,741 --> 01:28:15,560
There's going to be pills that you can
take and you'll be happy even if your

1540
01:28:15,561 --> 01:28:19,220
life is shit. That would be, I like that.

1541
01:28:19,221 --> 01:28:22,310
That's the first knowledge you drop on
them. That's the first thing he tell him.

1542
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:26,090
Tell him you will one day be ruled
by pills to control your emotions

1543
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,930
and then they can lock you in a cage
if you say the wrong words. Oh no

1544
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,750
dude, I would buy into that
cold if I was in the 60s yeah,

1545
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,980
the 60s would be an interesting time
to go back to with all the knowledge of

1546
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:44,270
today would have the knowledge like
imagine if you knew like political shit.

1547
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:48,530
Today's the day they killed Kennedy. Cause
you imagine how much you want to bet.

1548
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,640
How much am I bet they kill Kennedy today.
You're just as bad as you.

1549
01:28:52,641 --> 01:28:57,500
Don't try to stop it. Stop it.
He does. He just go to Vegas.

1550
01:28:57,501 --> 01:28:59,480
You go can,
I bet they fucking killed the president.

1551
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:02,550
You want to bet pitch and they'll,
they'll, they'll take your money. Vegas,

1552
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:03,210
we'll take your money.

1553
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:06,650
But then that's back sixties Vegas
where it's all gangsters and shit. Yeah,

1554
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,460
they kill you for being
right. They're like, listen,

1555
01:29:08,461 --> 01:29:11,730
we know when Kennedy is going to die.
We're going to be a part of how stupid.

1556
01:29:11,731 --> 01:29:16,560
Fuck we're going to, we're going to make
the driver go really slow in Dallas.

1557
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,790
Yeah they did.
That's different.

1558
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:25,950
You don't want to be part of that
part of the 60s that would suck now.

1559
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:28,620
Definitely they killed people back then.

1560
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:33,060
They had problems with them like JFK,
RFK and they just sat and ate them.

1561
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,820
Sneak up behind them in
front of a bunch of people.

1562
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,260
That's the crazy shit like RFK was.
He was,

1563
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,250
he was running for president who send
me just like walked up to him with a gun

1564
01:29:44,251 --> 01:29:49,040
and shot of, yeah, dude, I was at
the place where they did it. We, uh,

1565
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:52,230
we filmed some fear factors there.
Oh really? Where is that? At?

1566
01:29:52,231 --> 01:29:55,290
Some hotel in downtown. I think
they're, they might be tearing it down.

1567
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:59,130
I think bill burr was really upset
about it. Wait, that's here in la.

1568
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,980
Bill Burr was really upset about
it. It was, and he's so right.

1569
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:05,640
He's so dead on as always. But he was
like, ah. He goes, no one he has any,

1570
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:08,940
any idea history, you know,
if that was back east,

1571
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:13,710
you couldn't fucking tear that down and
put a fucking parking lot there. He goes,

1572
01:30:13,711 --> 01:30:14,460
no,
it'd be like it.

1573
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:17,340
There'll be a plaque there so you could
know that this is where the shit went

1574
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:21,960
down. It's so true. But in la
they were like, yeah, Robert
Kennedy was killed here,

1575
01:30:21,961 --> 01:30:24,540
or whatever. It's, this
is, it's a strip club now,

1576
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:30,960
but now it's like, yeah, the downtown is
that, she said weird here. Your place.

1577
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,130
Have you been a skid row yet? I
have, Whoa, her legs like first,

1578
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:36,750
like one of my first weeks up here,

1579
01:30:36,751 --> 01:30:41,190
I was trying to go to a Laker game and
I and I made a wrong turn and all of a

1580
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:43,260
sudden they was like
fucking 28 days later.

1581
01:30:43,261 --> 01:30:46,770
Like it's just like so packed with it was,

1582
01:30:46,771 --> 01:30:50,220
I've never seen just the
concentration of the sale.

1583
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:53,820
You can't believe it unless you say
it. It's, it's really, it's true.

1584
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,540
Can't believe unless you say
it's, it's, it's staggering. You.

1585
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:59,750
You think we're exaggerating. You're
saying there's no way anybody would it,

1586
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:02,130
they've become a tribe.

1587
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:06,090
It's a tribe of homeless people and
there's maybe thousands of them.

1588
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,180
So I saw something else.
I said, no, no, no.

1589
01:31:09,181 --> 01:31:12,570
I saw something and said there was
100,000 homeless people living in downtown

1590
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:16,860
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
You know. Crazy. That sounds,

1591
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:20,940
that's like an arm 100. That's what I'm
talking about, man. Skid row is weird.

1592
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:25,500
We filmed some fear factor stuff,
a lot of it in downtown La on buildings.

1593
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:29,320
We do like things when people out across
buildings and shit like that. And, um,

1594
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:33,900
we were always like right
around the corner and sometimes
we had to like do shit.

1595
01:31:33,901 --> 01:31:38,010
Like that was like right there in the
thick of things and so you would go around

1596
01:31:38,011 --> 01:31:40,380
the corner and like when you leave work,

1597
01:31:40,381 --> 01:31:43,260
if you went around the corner and took
a left and then took another left,

1598
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:47,590
you're in a Zombie movie. You really
are like, you fucked up. You're,

1599
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:51,150
you're on the wrong street and people
are asking you for money and they're

1600
01:31:51,151 --> 01:31:54,560
touching your car and you're like,
what is going on?

1601
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,800
I didn't see any of that
in San Diego by the way.

1602
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,730
And Sue's good.

1603
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:05,710
And also the marijuana shit was so
much stricter. Yeah. He was like,

1604
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:09,190
like even the body guards or
the bouncers of every club,

1605
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:11,660
we're all ex military or something.
Like I said, they were like, Oh,

1606
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,100
you smoke a bong, you better not be
smoke weed. Yeah, they gotta relax.

1607
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:19,360
They got to relax on that. Every,
that it's good. It's, there's,

1608
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,790
there's good and bad in military presence.

1609
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:26,980
It'd be more good than bad if they let
them smoke weed soldiers who smoked.

1610
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:29,830
We would be like the best soldiers
to have the bill like lesson.

1611
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:34,150
Everything's going to work out. We're
going to, we obviously fucked up.

1612
01:32:34,151 --> 01:32:36,940
We're going to slowly back up. By
the way, we have a show tonight.

1613
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:38,470
If you're listening to
this live right now,

1614
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:42,340
there's still tickets available so you
can still get down here at the ice house.

1615
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,880
It's a super show. Like
we always do these, um,

1616
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:48,880

Dove David off Jesus fucking Christ.

1618
01:32:53,171 --> 01:32:56,830
If you've never seen dove, he's very,
very funny. He's fucking hilarious.

1619
01:32:56,831 --> 01:33:00,750
Very unique too. He's um, he's
like one of my favorite guys.

1620
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:04,860
Watch and dom [inaudible] one of my all

1622
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:10,420
which Joe,

1623
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:12,940
you know the joke came and talk about it
cause I don't want anybody to know the

1624
01:33:12,941 --> 01:33:16,030
joke. That joke. Yeah,
yeah. That one. Yeah.

1625
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:18,460
I have a new one that I'm in
love with and do that too.

1626
01:33:18,461 --> 01:33:21,840
But I got to hear that other joke.
That's, I love that joke. And a,

1627
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:25,420
that'd be tonight if it's

1628
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:30,430
10 o'clock show and uh, and I have a,
I'm doing like half hour, 40 minutes,

1629
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:34,450
something like that at the end. Who would
they not get drunk and I might go long.

1630
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:37,480
Who are the comedians that
you like would pay to see now?

1631
01:33:37,481 --> 01:33:41,560
Like the ones your favorites? Ah, I paid
to see anybody. Good man. I love comedy.

1632
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:44,080
I mean I don't have to pay
really, really. Cause I, you know,

1633
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:46,990
most guys are going to like ask them
and they'll let me come into their show.

1634
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:48,670
But I'd still love to go see comedy.

1635
01:33:48,671 --> 01:33:52,960
Like we just saw dice clay at the Riviera
and Vegas. I fucking loved it, man.

1636
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:57,570
Me and Brian, we were like little
kids. We w how fun was that show? Oh,

1637
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:01,800
it was great. So much fun. Exactly what
I wanted. Yeah, it was, we all were, uh,

1638
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,170
were hanging out and um,

1639
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:06,760
we were in Vegas for the UFC and
it was Friday night and I was free.

1640
01:34:06,761 --> 01:34:09,730
We didn't have anything to do.
And a opie and Anthony, you know,

1641
01:34:09,731 --> 01:34:14,020
you know those guys. You ever done a
show? Jimmy Norton and Anthony Kumiai,

1642
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,890
we're in town and there, um, one of the
guys that works on show, Sam Roberts,

1643
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:20,500
he was in town too.
And so we all went out to dinner together.

1644
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:24,700
So while we're out at dinner we'd go,
let's go see dices show. So we text, dice,

1645
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:27,240
dice, text back. We'd go
there and it was like,

1646
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:31,000
like we were like little kids were like,
we get to go see a show.

1647
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:35,650
Like I got to go see dice at the Riviera.
I was so happy.

1648
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:38,740
Like I fucking love to
go see like a good show.

1649
01:34:38,741 --> 01:34:40,990
I didn't have to pay for
it cause dice hooked me up,

1650
01:34:40,991 --> 01:34:44,530
but I would be happy to pay to see
that. That was really fun. You know?

1651
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:47,980
I mean when I was a first start now,
before it was successful,

1652
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:51,100
it was really hard for me to go see too
many comedians because I would like,

1653
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:54,220
I'd feel like like God,
I Suck and listen to that guy.

1654
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:58,190
I don't even want to even want
to go on stage now and, and

1655
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,590
then I would be like weirded
out by other people's acts.

1656
01:35:00,591 --> 01:35:02,930
Like I didn't want to watch people
do better than me, I didn't want.

1657
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,960
But then once you get to a
certain little level of comfort,

1658
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:08,270
you realize why he became a
comedian in the first place.

1659
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:13,220
It's because you love watching stuff and
laughing at it and so then you get to

1660
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:15,710
figure it out again and
then be a fan again. So me,

1661
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:18,530
it was like the first 10
years of my comedy life,

1662
01:35:18,531 --> 01:35:23,450
it was like a cycle of like
slowly figuring out that
you just have to like enjoy

1663
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:23,680
it,

1664
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:28,010
like and just laugh at everything and it
don't just because you're a struggling

1665
01:35:28,011 --> 01:35:31,640
comedian don't not enjoy comedy
because comedy is like the best form of

1666
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:34,190
entertainment. That's why you like it
in the first place. Right. You know,

1667
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:36,020
don't not like it because you suck at it.

1668
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:42,530
By the way, Joe, I don't know if you know
about this yet or, or, or not, but, uh,

1669
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:47,370
Steve, uh, car leasing from OPA
and Anthony [inaudible] happen.

1670
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:52,090
Uh, you know, I don't know. I got to, I
got an email today from Iraq. Uh, and uh,

1671
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,780
but there, there's a memorial fund
for his family. I'm, here's a,

1672
01:35:55,781 --> 01:36:00,760
I remember last time I talked
to him. Oh yeah, yeah. Is the,

1673
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:05,200
uh, the address I tweeted if you want to,
if you want to Twitter, Twitter it, uh,

1674
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:09,130
but tell people that are listening to
this on their phone where they could find

1675
01:36:09,131 --> 01:36:12,790
it. Um, yeah, it is. Let's see. Well,

1676
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:17,940
the addresses go fund me.com/v h zero EDW,

1677
01:36:20,051 --> 01:36:22,150
which makes no sense, but
if you go to my Twitter, uh,

1678
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:25,470
it's red bin or go to Joe Rogan's Twitter
where I'm sure he's gonna tweet it,

1679
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:29,070
right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm
going to retweet it right
here. When it says on, um,

1680
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:31,570
on Brian's is,
I'm very sad about this.

1681
01:36:31,571 --> 01:36:34,840
Steve was a great guy and today's date is,
is what

1682
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:35,740
is it?
The 18th.

1683
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:40,600
So if you'd go to Brian's Twitter feed
on the 18th and fans of Opie and Anthony

1684
01:36:40,601 --> 01:36:42,480
know him, he was a really nice guy. He,

1685
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:46,720
I remember he had a really cool tattoos
and he's a really cool guy. I the socks,

1686
01:36:46,721 --> 01:36:51,580
I don't know what happens. Terrible News.
Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, I saw Sam's email.

1687
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:56,380
He sent me an email as well and uh, he
gave us a URL, I believe, didn't he?

1688
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,740
Uh, yeah, that's the one
I just twittered okay,

1689
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:03,610
but can he give it out to people?
I just didn't know what I just did it,

1690
01:37:03,611 --> 01:37:06,610
it makes no sense. It's like back slash
and all bunch of numbers and words.

1691
01:37:06,611 --> 01:37:10,120
So it's one of those, okay, well,
it's on my Twitter. I retweeted it.

1692
01:37:10,121 --> 01:37:12,670
It's on Brian's and we're
very sorry to hear that.

1693
01:37:12,671 --> 01:37:16,810
He was a great guy and
hopefully he's in heaven. Yeah.

1694
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:21,410
Or darkness. Darkness. Like
your dad would say that's,

1695
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:25,960
that's fucking disturbing. Heaven's better
having Sue's it better. That sucks man.

1696
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:29,210
I hate hearing shit like
that. How old is he? Oh,

1697
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:33,640
I don't think he was very old at all. I
don't even think it was 40 was he? No,

1698
01:37:33,641 --> 01:37:36,710
he was in English. I think it
was in the early days. Yeah.

1699
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:41,170
That he lost a ton of weight,
right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

1700
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:42,820
But that was a while ago.
But yeah,

1701
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:47,610
but it looks like they've almost reached
their goal, so that's great. Um, they're,

1702
01:37:47,611 --> 01:37:52,390
they're trying to raise 30,000 so I have
so many openings for the fans. I guess.

1703
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:56,220
That's good. Come through.
That's awesome. Thanks

1704
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:58,560
everybody.
And thank you Brian for bringing,

1705
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:02,150
that's frigging the show down
to screeching halt. It is a,

1706
01:38:02,151 --> 01:38:06,320
that is a bummer though,
man. So I, I have some,

1707
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:11,340
an update of a past episode wherein I
smoked moth poop and a little bit of

1708
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:13,880
orange fluorescent orange
stuff came out of it.

1709
01:38:13,881 --> 01:38:17,780
I found out that it was actually shit.
So like I didn't know for sure.

1710
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:21,740
She didn't know if it was eggs or
styling something use. He smoked it.

1711
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:22,603
This is the problem.

1712
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:25,260
The kid did ecstasy two days ago and
he hasn't been the same sentence.

1713
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,880
I don't know whether I should call us mom.

1714
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,140
I'm thinking I need to call
his mom and say, Mrs Red Ban.

1715
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:35,910
We got a situation here. Yeah, it's
show. Yeah, Brian's friend. Yeah.

1716
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:40,410
He's um, it's just, uh, I don't,
I think, I think you fucked up.

1717
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:43,170
I think he smoked too much. Mark.
Thank you. Went over the other side.

1718
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:44,723
I don't know what,

1719
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:47,550
I didn't tie his ankle and I don't know
if we're ever going to get them back.

1720
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:53,020
Dude, I did ecstasy once and
I couldn't read the next day.

1721
01:38:53,021 --> 01:38:55,660
I can't believe you do it so often.
I don't do it often.

1722
01:38:55,661 --> 01:38:59,710
I do it every three months. Maybe
that's a lot months. It's for me.

1723
01:38:59,711 --> 01:39:04,420
That's terrifying. Oh, and I don't do x.
Do they do, do Molly, which is better.

1724
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:05,440
Better wait about it.
Huh?

1725
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:09,700
Okay. I have a bad, I had a great
experience and a bad experience,

1726
01:39:09,701 --> 01:39:12,430
a great experience, and it felt
really good, bad experiences.

1727
01:39:12,431 --> 01:39:15,760
The next day I was useless.
I was dried out. It's like,

1728
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,450
I felt like I would literally
had been dried out like my brain,

1729
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:21,580
like a sponge that was out in the sun.

1730
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:24,940
That seems like that's the
worst part for me. It was.

1731
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:29,080
I mean I think everybody's different
in how I have bad sleep apnea too.

1732
01:39:29,110 --> 01:39:31,900
So I think I'm always a
little bit depleted, you know,

1733
01:39:31,901 --> 01:39:35,800
when it comes to a shit like that. If
I, back then I wasn't on top of it.

1734
01:39:35,801 --> 01:39:38,680
I didn't know now where like
this mouthpiece that keeps me,

1735
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:40,280
I have a big tongue and have fun.
No,

1736
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:44,920
you don't need to know all this shit
about me, dude. Okay. My point was,

1737
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,300
um,
maybe uh,

1738
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:50,320
maybe that hindered me from coming back
as good cause I wasn't getting very good

1739
01:39:50,321 --> 01:39:53,500
sleep, but it was hard for
me to bounce back mentally.

1740
01:39:53,501 --> 01:39:55,630
I don't think I was the
same for several days.

1741
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:58,660
The next day I remember feeling really,
really stupid,

1742
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:02,290
like think and I went on stage and
try to remember my act, but it was,

1743
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:06,370
it was not good. It was just a really
mediocre show. It wasn't a good show.

1744
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:11,320
I remember for like three or four days
thinking this is a fucking terrible idea.

1745
01:40:11,321 --> 01:40:15,570
I learned so much about myself, but I was
like, I'm never doing this again. Fuck

1746
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:20,970
yeah. I one time I went college, my
neighbors, uh, they used to sell weed,

1747
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,530
coke and everything like that and I
played baseball in college and uh,

1748
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:27,680
so I could never eat, couldn't
do any drag, sees you got
drug tested all the time.

1749
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:30,590
And then uh,
I had this fucked up injury again,

1750
01:40:30,591 --> 01:40:33,320
I'm telling you too much information.
But anyway,

1751
01:40:33,321 --> 01:40:36,770
they gave me this shit to smoke cause I
wasn't getting drug tests anymore and I

1752
01:40:36,771 --> 01:40:38,150
didn't know,
but they had just like,

1753
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:41,330
I guess they had sprinkled coke and
something else on it. Whoa. Yeah.

1754
01:40:41,331 --> 01:40:42,000
And I didn't know,

1755
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,010
I just thought I was smoking weed and
so I smoked it and I was just like going

1756
01:40:46,011 --> 01:40:49,100
out of my fucking mind. Like I knew it
wasn't. We'd like 10 minutes into it,

1757
01:40:49,101 --> 01:40:51,410
I was like, my heart was beating
super fast and I was getting,

1758
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:54,090
I was sweaty on just
one half of my face and

1759
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,230
the other half was like, it's
perfectly dry. The other,

1760
01:40:56,231 --> 01:40:59,830
I was just like dripping sweat and
for the next two days I thought I was

1761
01:40:59,831 --> 01:41:03,790
retarded. Like I couldn't, I
couldn't think through thoughts.

1762
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:06,790
Like it was freaking me out.
I've never done coke,

1763
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:11,791
but the whole coke culture of getting
really high and then crashing through the

1764
01:41:12,161 --> 01:41:16,600
fucking bottom is so unappealing to me.
I don't understand.

1765
01:41:16,601 --> 01:41:20,110
It scares the shit out of me.
Yeah. No, that's why I like,

1766
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:23,500
cause I like being kinda up.
So that's why I, same thing,

1767
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:26,830
I've never done coke because I know
I'll do it and then I'll really like it.

1768
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,280
And every, everybody, I, every time
I'm with somebody who, who does coke,

1769
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:33,210
they're always just like
looking for more coke. Oh yeah.

1770
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:38,470
Like you have to sit and enjoy it. I liked
it that much. I liked it for a month,

1771
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:43,000
but after a while that, that feeling of
always looking for it. I, at least for me,

1772
01:41:43,001 --> 01:41:44,260
I was like, yeah, this sucks.

1773
01:41:44,261 --> 01:41:46,870
Why do I want to keep on doing something
that I want to keep on looking for?

1774
01:41:46,871 --> 01:41:50,740
And I keep on spinning like
$100 every couple hours. Yeah.

1775
01:41:50,741 --> 01:41:52,120
You're an interesting dude,
Brian.

1776
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:55,300
And that a lot of people don't
realize like you go, oh, you know,

1777
01:41:55,301 --> 01:41:59,380
Brian doesn't have a, it doesn't have
a lot of willpower. You actually do.

1778
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:03,880
You have a lot of willpower and you
lost an insane amount of weight really

1779
01:42:03,881 --> 01:42:07,870
quickly. You lost like
70 or 80 pounds. Right?

1780
01:42:07,871 --> 01:42:09,580
How many pounds did you lose?
I don't remember.

1781
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:11,800
I think it was 75 pounds or 70 pounds.

1782
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:14,920
And he did it over a really short
period of time, four months.

1783
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:18,580
And it was really shocking to watch
him just shrink. And I was like,

1784
01:42:18,581 --> 01:42:22,000
what will you, when you put your mind to
shit, you can, you can get things done.

1785
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:25,810
But most of the time you just decided
not to put your mind to think, oh,

1786
01:42:25,811 --> 01:42:27,490
I put my mind too much.
Too much.

1787
01:42:27,491 --> 01:42:30,880
Now what did you do to lose
all that weight so quick? Uh,

1788
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:32,650
I just did white weight watchers,

1789
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,920
but I did half the points at
like a hacked weight watchers.

1790
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:40,480
I did half the points and, and then I,
I just did a lot of zero point things.

1791
01:42:40,481 --> 01:42:43,060
Like all vegetables.
I just ate vegetables nonstop to,

1792
01:42:43,061 --> 01:42:44,830
I couldn't eat any more vegetables.

1793
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:47,650
Did you feel good worked out when
you were really light like that?

1794
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:50,770
Did you feel good? Yeah. Um,

1795
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:56,320
I don't remember if I felt the same
as I do now. I didn't feel any better.

1796
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:59,210
I don't remember feeling going
like, oh, I feel great. No,

1797
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:01,880
you were exercising a lot too
though, right? Why don't you, uh,

1798
01:43:01,881 --> 01:43:06,560
I was exercising five, four days a week,
five days a week. It's a lot for you.

1799
01:43:06,561 --> 01:43:09,740
Like how often you do it
now? Uh, once, let's see,

1800
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,770
I've done it twice in the last six months.

1801
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:17,470
That was great delivery,
man.

1802
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:22,150
I walked a lot of comic con
he don't really be funny.

1803
01:43:22,151 --> 01:43:26,920
You should say that on stage.
That was funny. That was
really good delivery. Yeah,

1804
01:43:26,921 --> 01:43:29,770
but like somebody just asked me that
exact same question today and I was like,

1805
01:43:29,771 --> 01:43:30,101
you know what?

1806
01:43:30,101 --> 01:43:34,710
I walked probably a good five miles this
last week and that kind of comic con,

1807
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,920
but I do a lot of that shit where I'm
like, oh no, I mean I do exercise,

1808
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:42,460
move your body from one place to
another without equipment. Right.

1809
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:45,920
I Walk to Starbucks, that's
what he gets. It is working out,

1810
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,710
moving his body unassisted.

1811
01:43:48,030 --> 01:43:52,070
You will be the first amongst us to
give in to having one of those fucking,

1812
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,220
those uh, those freeway things.
What are those things? Segues.

1813
01:43:56,570 --> 01:44:00,250
That's how you're going to get a ride.
I want to, I want to go on a segway.

1814
01:44:00,251 --> 01:44:03,140
That's what does guilty pleasures that
I haven't done yet. You know, like,

1815
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:07,070
I just want to treat myself to a segway.
You never, you really never done one.

1816
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:12,410
They're amazing. Pretty cool.
They're super cool. It's a gyroscope.

1817
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:15,560
The only issue with those things is,
um, they, when they were shut off,

1818
01:44:15,561 --> 01:44:18,980
they would just shut off and people
would just fall on their ass and it's,

1819
01:44:18,981 --> 01:44:22,000
you know, you really get jacked
like old people like, you know,

1820
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:25,190
fell and got fucked up. I hear the
new ones are just fucking bad. Yeah,

1821
01:44:25,191 --> 01:44:28,250
the new one's let you know. They like beep
and shit. They let you know it's dying.

1822
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:31,940
Get off me bitch. I'm going
to die. I wonder what they
did. The guys created them.

1823
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:35,230
He drove off a cliff on one. I think
the guy who really need it. Yes.

1824
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:39,350
He fell off a cliff on
one. Yeah. Um, whoops.

1825
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:41,810
What?
Fuck that man.

1826
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:45,530
Imagine watching that happen in the
beginning of a Coen brothers movie.

1827
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:51,950
The Guy, he's fucking zipping
her alarm on the Pacific highway,

1828
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:58,390
waving the people hanging in and he looks
down at his phone and check his text

1829
01:44:59,121 --> 01:45:04,121
messages and write as he types l o l
to something that's not even remotely

1830
01:45:04,761 --> 01:45:09,320
fucking funny. Why the new ones
are fucking amazing. I'm hungry.

1831
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:13,480
Lol. Boom. Off the cliff and
you watch him flip. Don't,

1832
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:17,870
don't, don't, don't, don't tell dunk.

1833
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:22,250
And the coyote's moving
to check these new models.

1834
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:26,680
Start chewing them apart at night.
Yeah, they're dope as fuck duty.

1835
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:30,950
Kevin James used one for that.
Paul Blart Mall cop movie.

1836
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:33,350
And then once he use it for that,

1837
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:36,320
he decided to bring them with
him when he does any movie.

1838
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:40,580
Cause it's like the best way
to get around. I got on a
big satis specially so he,

1839
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:43,140
he had a couple of those
on I shown me and him.

1840
01:45:43,141 --> 01:45:46,190
We used to go around the Boston
common with them. It was so fun.

1841
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:47,610
How fast are those go?

1842
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:53,440
Probably like as fast as you can run Max
speed 20 miles an hour or 12 miles an

1843
01:45:54,861 --> 01:45:58,700
hour. Know they, they have um, ones
I think that cops use that go faster.

1844
01:45:58,701 --> 01:46:01,520
I think I'm thinking of those. Yeah,
I've seen those ones. Cause what does,

1845
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:05,680
what does a person have fast person run?
Like what do they worn?

1846
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:09,080
Like 30 miles an hour or something like
close to like, like you saying bolt,

1847
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:11,510
what does he do? He does like
close to 30 miles an hour, right?

1848
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:14,870
Isn't that funny person who was a car?
They wouldn't be shit.

1849
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:20,180
Weak ass fucking bitch. 30
miles an hour. Mr. Segway hard.

1850
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:23,420
That's annoying. It's annoying when
you have to go 30 miles an hour. Yeah.

1851
01:46:23,421 --> 01:46:23,850
You're like,

1852
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:27,250
I can see if you're on the highway
and you can only go 30 miles an hour,

1853
01:46:27,251 --> 01:46:32,200
you'd be like, oh, this is going to take
for it. Well that's you running full lip.

1854
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:35,870
The fastest human in the hurling,

1855
01:46:35,871 --> 01:46:40,160
his body against gravity.
That's a,

1856
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:43,900
anytime people are like, oh, this guy is
such an amazing athlete. I'm like, I can,

1857
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:49,010
I just saw a fucking bear run like 35 40.
And he's like a fat slow bear,

1858
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:50,870
big giant ass fucking animal.

1859
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:54,310
You see what those things look
like when they lose their hair? Oh,

1860
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:58,950
you look amazing. It's their hair.
Yeah. There's a bear that has uh, some,

1861
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:03,600
some form of Maine's probably and uh,
there's pictures of it like with no hair.

1862
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:08,090
It looks like some creature in like,
like a never ending story or something.

1863
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:08,841
It doesn't look real.

1864
01:47:08,841 --> 01:47:11,670
It like a hobbit type picture say
is if you can find that it looks,

1865
01:47:11,671 --> 01:47:16,050
it looks like dark crystal actually. Yeah.
Look at that. Oh my God. Come on, man.

1866
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:20,670
How strange is that? That's horrible.
I had a dog that had mains like that.

1867
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:24,000
Not that bad, but giant patches
of her body. When I found her,

1868
01:47:24,001 --> 01:47:26,760
I rescued her giant patches
of her body would like that.

1869
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:30,960
That's apparently where the Chupa copper,
they think the myth comes from too.

1870
01:47:30,961 --> 01:47:34,050
It was coyotes. They get that
age. Coyotes would have mains.

1871
01:47:34,051 --> 01:47:38,490
They lose all their hair and they look
for Riki. They look really fucking creepy.

1872
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:42,750
Have you see if you can find one of
those coyotes with no hair man. Ooh,

1873
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:47,070
what does that, he's got to pick
pink shirt on. Ms Paint for us

1874
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:54,120
a frosh. How was that
still in use? No wait,

1875
01:47:54,121 --> 01:47:58,900
what was it called again? Where are we
talking about coyote with main change?

1876
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:02,100
Eh, you know the, the, the images,

1877
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:05,880
one of them was on I think one of
those like monster quest type shows.

1878
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:09,230
They were trying to say like,
someone thought they had a
Chupa copper, right? Yeah.

1879
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,490
And that's what it turned out to be.
Turned out to be a coyote.

1880
01:48:11,491 --> 01:48:14,730
That it had the mange or they lose all
the hair on their body and they just look

1881
01:48:14,731 --> 01:48:19,110
really freaky cause it chipped. It has
no hair to have you seen that? Yeah.

1882
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:22,840
That's one of them, man. Huh? What are
you doing? Are you going the other way?

1883
01:48:22,841 --> 01:48:27,570
It's um, there's a chip that has no hair
to that one is really frightening. Yeah.

1884
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:28,463
Pull that up.

1885
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:33,150
The chimp with no hair is crazy because
you really start to think like how

1886
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:36,840
terrifying it would be if this thing was
trying to bite your dick off. Like wait.

1887
01:48:36,841 --> 01:48:40,830
It probably would do if it got
alone with you. You're actually,

1888
01:48:40,831 --> 01:48:45,330
it looks like a girl at like an
gross grown bar. Yeah. Look at that.

1889
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,150
That's horrible late.
Do you see the full image?

1890
01:48:48,151 --> 01:48:51,780
His body is enormous to his
muscles are fucking huge.

1891
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:57,250
Pull that one up right there. Look
at that. Click on that. Gee, he's us.

1892
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:59,910
Look at the size of his fucking muscles,

1893
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,150
dude. That's like, yeah.

1894
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:05,720
And that's a chimpanzee.
These muscles are way stronger than yours.

1895
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:09,490
So that, that creepy looking
beast has probably, you know,

1896
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,990
strength of a 500 600 pound man.

1897
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:15,470
Maybe even more if he was like a
ripped 500, 600 pound that. Yeah,

1898
01:49:15,471 --> 01:49:18,410
like a superhuman. I mean there,
there's so much stronger than us.

1899
01:49:18,411 --> 01:49:20,870
They think he can hurl
his body through the air,

1900
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:24,800
grab ahold of things with one arm
and slinging his body to their side.

1901
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:28,310
Do you ever seen one of those guys get
angry in a cage and hurl themselves

1902
01:49:28,311 --> 01:49:29,050
around?

1903
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:33,670
Dude, I, I uh, I live right by the
zoo in San Diego. May go all the time.

1904
01:49:33,671 --> 01:49:34,420
I got a pass.

1905
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:37,400
Oh, that a wild animal
park. That's awesome. Zoo.

1906
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:39,423
And uh,

1907
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:43,120
one time I was at the monkey cage and
this guy was just like banging on the

1908
01:49:43,121 --> 01:49:47,120
glass trying to get the monkeys
to pay attention to him. Stupid.

1909
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,280
And the monkey

1910
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,770
came up like it was, I was
like, I don't know what it was.

1911
01:49:50,771 --> 01:49:53,680
It was like a Bonobo or
something like that and it just,

1912
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:57,730
it just fucking rock the glass
once and put a crack in it.

1913
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:01,630
And then like all of a sudden, like all
of the fucking, you know, zookeeper,

1914
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:03,700
people came in and ship it.
Like it was just,

1915
01:50:03,701 --> 01:50:07,210
it looked like a monkey that looked like
a hundred pound monkey and it was so

1916
01:50:07,211 --> 01:50:11,750
fucking strong that it put a crack in
this class. Yeah, it was a chimp. Oh Wow.

1917
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:15,610
Cause we shouldn't really say monkey
chimp that people get angry. It's racist.

1918
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:19,630
They get angry with me is
incorrect for apes, monkeys,

1919
01:50:19,631 --> 01:50:24,250
hotels is, that's what that's I
call called monkeys to the chimp.

1920
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:25,420
Then this was a chimp.

1921
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:28,900
Chimps are super fucking strong and a
hundred pound champ could fuck you up.

1922
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:33,370
Oh yeah. Fuck you up man. And imagine
like those gorillas, that's just like go.

1923
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:38,110
That's one of the greatest movie scenes
in any movie ever was when the gorilla

1924
01:50:38,111 --> 01:50:41,800
comes out and starts running shit on
that planet of the apes movie. We're all,

1925
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:43,300
the champs were thinking they were bad.
I asked,

1926
01:50:43,301 --> 01:50:47,260
are we going to have a little battles
to see who's the most fucking Badass and

1927
01:50:47,290 --> 01:50:49,600
the smart Shims, like I'm just going
to make friends with this gorilla.

1928
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:54,440
That was an odd that I was surprised
how much I liked that movie and love

1929
01:50:54,450 --> 01:50:58,300
gorillas, man. When gorillas go crazy,
I love it. It's primal, you know?

1930
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:01,060
As long as I'm not there,
so it's not actually terrifying.

1931
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:04,200
I'm totally rooting for that gorilla.
The gorilla comes down,

1932
01:51:04,230 --> 01:51:07,720
just just goes crazy and all
the chips are like, oh shit.

1933
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:11,980
It's kind of funny when you think
about it, man. He's fearless animals.

1934
01:51:11,981 --> 01:51:16,210
He's fucking super animals that are
going to take over downtown Manhattan.

1935
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:20,400
They're still terrified of that gorilla.
I would love to see it's,

1936
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:21,370
I know it's impossible.

1937
01:51:21,371 --> 01:51:24,460
I would love to see how much a
huge gorilla could bench press.

1938
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:28,030
I bet they could throw
around some insane numbers.

1939
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:32,320
If you look at their body structure,
it's so ridiculous. Like a big one,

1940
01:51:32,321 --> 01:51:33,550
like a big mountain gorilla.

1941
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:36,880
What do they wait like 600 pounds
or something like that? 800 pounds.

1942
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,610
He imagined how fucking
strong that thing was.

1943
01:51:39,611 --> 01:51:44,611
Being there is so strong that they don't
even have to climb in the trees to hide

1944
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:48,470
from the cats and shit like that.
Cancer aren't going to fuck with gorillas.

1945
01:51:49,390 --> 01:51:53,200
That is too much work, man. You know,
you get in a tussle with a gorilla,

1946
01:51:53,201 --> 01:51:57,520
you might not win those. They have
fangs too. Yeah, it's the offense to it.

1947
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,070
Really fixed skin and they are
so much bigger than you. Man,

1948
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:03,130
this is so big and so strong.
It's so crazy.

1949
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:07,540
It's weird. They have little decks. Super.

1950
01:52:07,541 --> 01:52:12,340
We humans are the primates
with the largest penises
and it's all related to how

1951
01:52:12,341 --> 01:52:16,810
many sexual partners are our females
are likely to encounter. Really? Yeah.

1952
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:22,620
The gorilla kingdom is a patriarchal
set up where he's got a Harem and those

1953
01:52:24,371 --> 01:52:25,630
girls are all monogamous.

1954
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:29,550
There's no sexual competition between
him and other rails. He has his own,

1955
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:34,150
he's had his Harem, so he has a little
Dick. He doesn't have to have big Dick.

1956
01:52:34,151 --> 01:52:38,950
Where's chips have big dicks? Those chimp
bitches are freaks and they freak on,

1957
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,233
you know,

1958
01:52:40,610 --> 01:52:44,470
and then with human beings they
found that the more promiscuous,

1959
01:52:44,471 --> 01:52:46,130
and this actually the animal kingdom

1960
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,350
as well,
the more promiscuous the females are,

1961
01:52:48,351 --> 01:52:51,650
the larger the testicles are of the males.
You know,

1962
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:55,940
it was even theorize that their specific
sperm that go after and kill other

1963
01:52:55,941 --> 01:52:56,331
sperm,

1964
01:52:56,331 --> 01:52:59,540
that's their only job duty is to go
after and attack the sperm of an but it

1965
01:52:59,541 --> 01:53:01,730
turns out that that was just
kinda of crazy speculation,

1966
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:06,910
or at least it's a mostly agreed by
smart folks in the know about the subject

1967
01:53:07,451 --> 01:53:09,760
that that's probably bullshit
or most likely bullshit,

1968
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:12,860
but fascinating nonetheless
to think that your balls grow,

1969
01:53:12,861 --> 01:53:16,400
which is fact that you develop more
sperm when you're around horse.

1970
01:53:18,530 --> 01:53:19,580
That's real,
man.

1971
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:21,640
That means that since I
went to San Diego state,

1972
01:53:21,641 --> 01:53:25,530
I should have gigantic fucking really
was San Diego state filled with with

1973
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:28,060
slutty girls. San Diego
state is like, yeah.

1974
01:53:28,061 --> 01:53:32,220
It's like if you're too dumb to get
into like a good school. Oh really? No.

1975
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:35,580
You still wanted to party and fuck
a bunch of people you were in.

1976
01:53:35,590 --> 01:53:36,423
You were a girl.

1977
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:38,670
Sounds like a movie.
How can we pitch it?

1978
01:53:38,671 --> 01:53:41,970
You write it and I know a dude who knows.

1979
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:47,130
What's that dude's name? Justin
Timberlake. We could do it, man.

1980
01:53:47,131 --> 01:53:48,060
We can make this happen.

1981
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:51,410
Dude. One time I was at
the, I was at the zoo,

1982
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:55,490
it's been at the sperm thing and this
monkey was in the corner just jacking off

1983
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,780
in the corner of the zoo,
but,

1984
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:00,380
and all the other monkeys were
in a circle talking and uh,

1985
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:04,260
and so he jerks off and he
finishes into his hand, no way.

1986
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:06,980
Finished it into his hand,
but just standing there,
he's not doing anything yet.

1987
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:12,050
And then he walks over to the group
monkeys that's talking and he smears it on

1988
01:54:12,051 --> 01:54:15,560
this one monkey's face and then he runs
away. Right. And so I'm like, oh my God,

1989
01:54:15,810 --> 01:54:20,150
I saw it. So she doesn't freak
out or like go crazy or get upset.

1990
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:23,960
She just like calmly
wipes or face smells it,

1991
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:25,370
and then licks it.

1992
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:28,970
And then she walks over to him and
puts her ass up and they start fucking,

1993
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:31,680
whoa.
Yeah.

1994
01:54:31,681 --> 01:54:35,070
So the way he got her to fuck him
wants to come on her face real quick.

1995
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:40,720
Oh my God. That is, to me, black cats,

1996
01:54:40,721 --> 01:54:43,710
those big black cats are the
scariest fucking thing I can say.

1997
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:44,970
Even for whatever reason,

1998
01:54:44,971 --> 01:54:49,560
more scary than tigers because tigers
you like almost feel like he could never

1999
01:54:49,561 --> 01:54:52,650
fight back. Right. And if you've got
to talk about a Jaguar, it's like man,

2000
01:54:52,651 --> 01:54:55,110
maybe might be able to live
cause they're not that big.

2001
01:54:55,170 --> 01:55:00,030
Well there there'll be 200
pounds fucking but account.

2002
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:03,090
Look at the muscles on that thing. I mean,
come on man. If that thing, one of the,

2003
01:55:03,091 --> 01:55:06,720
fuck you, is that a Jaguar? Fucking a
cheetah? No, no, no, no. They're, they're,

2004
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:11,700
they're both leopards and
the leopards are black too.

2005
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:15,860
Like the uh, like what the black
ones, what they are is like,

2006
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:20,740
he actually has spots on them. They're
just, most of his body is a spot I've had.

2007
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:24,930
They vary a little bit. I, whenever
it sounds like a car alarm, right?

2008
01:55:24,931 --> 01:55:29,280
They look so bad ass. It's such a
freaky co creation. By, by nature,

2009
01:55:29,281 --> 01:55:32,850
I mean look, look at the, just
the physical form of this thing.

2010
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:36,750
Just designed only to kill,
should really strong,

2011
01:55:36,751 --> 01:55:40,230
really fast and wants to attack
things that move in front of it.

2012
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:44,100
Like a ball of yarn. It's got such
a kill driving. He rolled a ball

2013
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,540
in front of it.
It jumps on a ball.

2014
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:50,920
She's written back getting the Dick and
to the, she helped him. Yeah. She's,

2015
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,570
she's gay marines around reaching down
right now, trying to get it in. Oh really?

2016
01:55:54,630 --> 01:55:56,880
Yeah, she is. Yeah. And uh, he'll get him.

2017
01:55:56,881 --> 01:55:59,760
He's trying to get this wrong whole

2018
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:06,900
pitch. Let me try it again. I got to have,
let me help. All right. Got To get back.

2019
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:11,360
Look at the size of his fucking
arms. Jesus Christ, man. Oh,

2020
01:56:11,361 --> 01:56:15,530
here we go. He figured out the lounge
position that's got a lounge style.

2021
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:18,880
He's like sitting back and he's got
his hand on her shoulders like, bitch,

2022
01:56:18,881 --> 01:56:21,680
you ain't going nowhere. Just let
me hold on. You're right here.

2023
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:25,160
The size of his fucking body.
He shot off.

2024
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:29,670
Oh, and she's just checking in.
She knows how to properly do it.

2025
01:56:29,671 --> 01:56:31,350
You hold it in there and get,

2026
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:34,800
make sure all the come gets in your
vagina's pregnant as what she's doing,

2027
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:39,710
isn't she? She's keeping the common, the
vagina. That's what they do. A on some,

2028
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:41,700
some sides of this in Los Angeles,

2029
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:46,930
the size of her bones,
like when she puts her hands up,

2030
01:56:46,931 --> 01:56:51,510
look at the size of the bones in the hand.
That thing would fuck you up.

2031
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:55,650
Oh my God, it would fuck you
up. Look at the size of that.

2032
01:56:56,810 --> 01:57:01,130
It's crazy that they only eat
like vegetables too, Huh? Yeah.

2033
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:03,350
Gorillas are insanely aggressive.

2034
01:57:03,370 --> 01:57:08,370
Sanely strong and they eat like Broccoli
or where are they getting their protein

2035
01:57:08,471 --> 01:57:11,140
rubbed? Get those big ass muscles.
Well I'm believe it or not,

2036
01:57:11,141 --> 01:57:13,780
most vegetables have very
high levels of protein,

2037
01:57:13,781 --> 01:57:15,730
especially leafy green vegetables.

2038
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,680
We just think of protein is only being
associated with animals eating steak or

2039
01:57:20,681 --> 01:57:24,820
so, but there's a lot of protein and
Kale. Kale is a massive amount of protein,

2040
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:29,830
so does Broccoli. If you eat like mad
quantities of that stuff, you can get all,

2041
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:33,640
almost everything that you can get from
meat except like the weird shit like

2042
01:57:33,641 --> 01:57:35,880
aggression, you know, get the, the,

2043
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,230
there's something aggressive
you get out of eating meat.

2044
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:39,220
I think there's something,

2045
01:57:39,290 --> 01:57:43,420
I really do firmly believe that there's
some something that happens when your

2046
01:57:43,421 --> 01:57:47,500
body processes the fact that it's eating
animal protein that makes you more

2047
01:57:47,501 --> 01:57:49,450
aggressive.
I really do believe it does.

2048
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:51,490
Is there any part of you,
Joe, that if at the end,

2049
01:57:51,491 --> 01:57:55,090
the following phone photo
that gets you kind of turned
on? All right. Ready, ready,

2050
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:55,983
go.

2051
01:57:56,420 --> 01:58:01,160
Hmm. Wow. You got to think that's
tight. It's all swollen and shit.

2052
01:58:01,190 --> 01:58:05,630
Like if it's completely, there's no way
that could be loose. Look out painful.

2053
01:58:05,631 --> 01:58:09,460
It looks, if you get it cleaned out
really well done, like they took my door.

2054
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:12,740
Am I feel so good? It might be worth
it. Yeah. You might if you don't,

2055
01:58:12,770 --> 01:58:16,220
if you could look off at the horizon, why
you fucked that thing. Yeah. I mean look,

2056
01:58:16,970 --> 01:58:18,650
it's basically like a fleshlight.
Right?

2057
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:23,880
How big is that? I don't know. That's
about, it's like a humongous, uh,

2058
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:28,080
uh, pumpkin. Yeah. It's
hard to, I don't know.

2059
01:58:28,081 --> 01:58:31,380
I think there's a small monkey.
Would you take it?

2060
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:34,520
Would you take that if it
was detailed and cleaned out

2061
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:39,530
that that being an ass was detailed? Is
that what that is that a baboons? Yeah.

2062
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:42,040
It is. Right? Yeah. What
a weird, a weird animal.

2063
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,570
Baboons as it looks like a dog sorta.
Yeah.

2064
01:58:44,890 --> 01:58:48,760
She had to pull up another picture
of a baboons head man, baboons, a.

2065
01:58:48,761 --> 01:58:52,360
They've also figured out how to raise
dogs. Have you seen that now? Yeah.

2066
01:58:52,361 --> 01:58:57,010
Baboons are so smart. They, um,
they actually steal puppies, um,

2067
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:57,790
from,
uh,

2068
01:58:57,790 --> 01:59:02,020
from the mothers and they raised them
and they raised them as guards and they,

2069
01:59:02,021 --> 01:59:05,780
uh, they feed them and they
keep them around so that
they can sleep and the dog's

2070
01:59:05,781 --> 01:59:08,530
stick around. The dogs would bark
and something's going on. Yeah.

2071
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:11,110
That's fucking amazing.
Fucking incredible, man.

2072
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:13,550
They're smart enough to
realize that if you keep dogs,

2073
01:59:13,610 --> 01:59:15,280
take them when they're puppies,
he keep around,

2074
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:18,810
they lock onto you and you're the daddy
just keep feeding them and then they,

2075
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,380
they bark when some shit comes around.

2076
01:59:20,490 --> 01:59:23,320
Yeah. I was watching this nature
show the other night and it was,

2077
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:26,230
all these wolves were
hunting air following them.

2078
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:29,080
And so there's all these wolves
and, and they were, it was,

2079
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:32,560
they were in between these two mountains
that sort of funneled into this one

2080
01:59:32,561 --> 01:59:36,310
little place. So all the wolves are
together, all of them leave. But one,

2081
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:41,370
one stays in this little like funnel
and then they scare up some animals and

2082
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:42,940
animals run down to the funnel.

2083
01:59:42,941 --> 01:59:45,700
And then that wolf that's waiting
there for him like jumps on him, right?

2084
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:50,170
So it means they like made a plan and
somehow non-verbally told one of the

2085
01:59:50,171 --> 01:59:54,370
wolves, like, you stay here and we'll
scare up pray that'll run to you.

2086
01:59:54,371 --> 01:59:58,900
And then you fuck it up. She's
crying. It's like, it's crazy.

2087
01:59:58,901 --> 02:00:02,800
Like how are they communicating like that?
Like is that happening? It's amazing.

2088
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:03,903
His baboons.

2089
02:00:05,570 --> 02:00:07,400
Yeah. What a weird looking animal. Right?

2090
02:00:08,090 --> 02:00:13,070
Look at their faces. They leave the
safety of the cliffs to forage for food.

2091
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:17,600
Let's look a lion monkey. Check out
those assets that has a really weird ass.

2092
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:22,160
Why is the answer now as
the females up to 40 pounds

2093
02:00:24,270 --> 02:00:26,780
as a heritage?
Wow.

2094
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:33,140
That's incredible. Confusing
me. But it's amazing.

2095
02:00:33,141 --> 02:00:38,120
They fight on these walls. Oh, he just
beat the shit out some bitch. Oh fuck.

2096
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:42,770
She got crazy. She did eat
is better. Oh, she's mad.

2097
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:47,090
She's really like letting him know,
but she fucked up.

2098
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:51,290
He looks mean.
What a creepy fucking animal.

2099
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:56,630
How much dry is baboons travel?
Overland and large groups for a reason.

2100
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:01,070
There are predators here,
leopards,

2101
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:06,170
hyenas and cheetahs
that face.

2102
02:01:06,370 --> 02:01:08,480
So freaky looking man.

2103
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:13,530
They did it and it was like
dog's snouts insects. Wow. Oh,

2104
02:01:13,550 --> 02:01:17,660
like Avatar. Totally. Avatar
Shit. Look at that. Then.

2105
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:22,070
It seems conscious. They've got
companies, but it looks like an animal.

2106
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:27,770
Another army of baboons has
also made camp on these cliffs.

2107
02:01:28,610 --> 02:01:32,780
Oh Jesus Christ. How much spelled
trouble have Boone trouble?

2108
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:38,300
How much dry is baboons will fight
over flies. Why is Oprah doing this?

2109
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,800
She loves baboons

2110
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:40,681
like all of us.

2111
02:01:40,681 --> 02:01:44,390
She likes the baboons gas as much as ID
really aren't like avatar creatures. Man

2112
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:50,230
is out there playing the piano.
Awesome.

2113
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:56,690
I'm so happy that Africa exists.
Yeah, but it can suck my dick.

2114
02:01:56,691 --> 02:02:01,370
I'm not going there. I'm not
going there. That is a crazy spot,

2115
02:02:01,371 --> 02:02:03,230
man.
Look at all this

2116
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:09,680
while we're looking at Q.
Imagine if this was in like North Dakota.

2117
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:11,810
You managed it.
If like you're driving in North Dakota,

2118
02:02:11,811 --> 02:02:14,990
you have to deal with fucking
packs of angry banded.

2119
02:02:15,850 --> 02:02:18,560
It would be hyenas.
Would it be completely hilarious though?

2120
02:02:18,561 --> 02:02:22,640
Like if a game show came in there and
just built like a toys r us or like a

2121
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:27,620
restaurant and just see how long it lasts
back on country. All the garden Africa,

2122
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:32,330
Pat Boone's man,
this is insanity on fear factor.

2123
02:02:32,331 --> 02:02:34,940
You had to have done some kind of
weird animal shit at some point. Well,

2124
02:02:34,941 --> 02:02:38,090
we avoided most dangerous
animals except bowls.

2125
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:41,450
That was the dumbest episode that we
ever did. There was only two episodes.

2126
02:02:41,451 --> 02:02:45,140
Why ever protests and what we were
doing. Oh, he's just jacking people.

2127
02:02:46,340 --> 02:02:50,780
Oh, it's fabulous. Ruthless.
Did he kill her? Oh whoa.

2128
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:56,020
That's fucked up life.
I was the life and death to Sundays at,

2129
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:59,510
there's only two episodes, a fear
factor that I ever protested. I said,

2130
02:02:59,511 --> 02:03:03,980
we shouldn't do. Not shouldn't
do, but I was like, I was
like, wow, you got serious.

2131
02:03:04,130 --> 02:03:08,960
One of them was riding a bull. I was like,
this is, you guys are crazy. We, it was,

2132
02:03:08,961 --> 02:03:12,170
we had an old stunt team. Then when
the, in the early days of fear factor,

2133
02:03:12,171 --> 02:03:15,230
they took, they were, you know, stunk guys
were rough dudes. You know, they're like,

2134
02:03:15,231 --> 02:03:17,990
I have someone's gonna get hurt.
You know we're going to be all right,

2135
02:03:17,991 --> 02:03:20,930
but someone might get hurt. They were
willing to take like way more chances.

2136
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:25,490
So they put people on these bowls and I
go, hey man, I go, are these safe? I go,

2137
02:03:25,491 --> 02:03:28,610
these are fucking bulls, man. How do you
know there's going to be safe? He goes,

2138
02:03:28,611 --> 02:03:32,510
well, these are these training
bowls. Then. Then I even
that aggressive, I'm like,

2139
02:03:32,511 --> 02:03:35,030
do they know their training?
She did. They know.

2140
02:03:35,031 --> 02:03:38,900
I think they just think their boats.
That thing is huge.

2141
02:03:38,901 --> 02:03:43,580
Like a bull is another avatar creature.
A bulls are ridiculous. This giant,

2142
02:03:43,581 --> 02:03:47,870
stupid fucking cunt of an animal with
huge horns and you're got to ride it and

2143
02:03:47,871 --> 02:03:50,240
it's locked in a cage.
They're going to open up the cage.

2144
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:53,300
You're going to hold on this bowl,
the fuck outta here.

2145
02:03:53,301 --> 02:03:55,580
That's one of the dumbest things I've
ever heard in my life. I was like,

2146
02:03:55,581 --> 02:03:58,190
you guys are just totally rolling a
dice is whether or not these people are

2147
02:03:58,191 --> 02:04:00,950
going to be okay. And that's exact
what happened over and over again.

2148
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:03,650
People are flying through the air, man.
Everybody got launched off, but you just,

2149
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:06,590
you're going to get launched off
period and you might get stomped.

2150
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:08,120
You might get kicked in the face.

2151
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:11,510
You might have to get your whole head
reconstructed, but that's not a joke.

2152
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:15,760
Could stomp on you. Poor cow.
We got the size of his deck.

2153
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:17,480
It's got strong on it and shit.

2154
02:04:17,481 --> 02:04:21,860
Dirty bastard mill this size
of that fucking bowl, man.
It's gonna melt that shit.

2155
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:26,300
Look at the size of the muscles
on that ball again. Each grass,

2156
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:28,850
that's all he's eating.
And he's aggressive as fuck.

2157
02:04:29,030 --> 02:04:33,290
Aggressive as fuck from eating.
Hey, fuck you up. He's huge.

2158
02:04:33,291 --> 02:04:35,300
He's got a giant Dick
and he eats. Hey, wait,

2159
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:38,160
what was the other one you
protested and look at this bowl.

2160
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:41,550
Sex was the other one where their fear
factor episode. That was the donkey.

2161
02:04:41,551 --> 02:04:44,940
Semen one donkey. Semen. They, uh,

2162
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:47,210
I thought that was the dumbest
thing I ever, I was like,

2163
02:04:47,211 --> 02:04:49,470
you can't get people to drink. Come
on man. I don't care if it comes,

2164
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:54,240
we're a donkey. Not like these volumes
that they were, it was like 24 ounces.

2165
02:04:54,241 --> 02:04:56,790
It was such a stupid amount of carb.
It was like,

2166
02:04:57,210 --> 02:05:01,680
there's no way you could do this.
This is not right. You can't do this.

2167
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:05,490
And they were like, whoa. It past
standards and practices and you know,

2168
02:05:05,491 --> 02:05:07,820
we could do it. And I'm like, okay, Hey,

2169
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:12,180
what's both sex as a term in sex road?
Bull sacks.

2170
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:14,970
I Dunno, what is it? Because
when I googled images I,

2171
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,710
there's a lot of crazy shit that
came on was probably some gay shit.

2172
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:21,240
Don't be looking at that. And if you
do it, don't throw up in the keyboard.

2173
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:24,260
And they said, don't panic.
Yeah. Straight out into the back.

2174
02:05:25,130 --> 02:05:28,560
This door's locked for your safety
because we were worried about you.

2175
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:33,420
But if you unlock that and go straight
that, that star babies out of the way,

2176
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:37,370
the other way.
Powerful.

2177
02:05:39,950 --> 02:05:42,920
Oh, powerful. Justin Helpern.
Yeah. Cool Dude. Right.

2178
02:05:44,030 --> 02:05:47,450
Southern California kid. Are you up in
San Diego? We're going to be this weekend.

2179
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:49,190
This weekend.
I'm in Calgary.

2180
02:05:49,191 --> 02:05:53,650
Bitch shows sold out the first show
sold out the second show. This one

2181
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:57,730
tickets left for the 10 o'clock show.
It's a at the Jack Singer concert hall.

2182
02:05:57,731 --> 02:06:01,050

2183
02:06:01,051 --> 02:06:05,650

one of those a million, you know,

2184
02:06:05,651 --> 02:06:09,590
character long links. But

2187
02:06:17,411 --> 02:06:21,220
Ari Shaffir and Duncan Trussell first
show sold out and then we got a 10 o'clock

2188
02:06:21,221 --> 02:06:24,550
show that still have some
tickets available and then
as a UFC the next night,

2189
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:28,870
harmful Calgary making shit
happen up there in Canada.

2190
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:33,700
I love Canada, Dude. That's where you
gotta go when the shit hits the fan.

2191
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:37,330
Coover yeah, that's a
good spot. Perfect view.

2192
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:42,760
A lot of extra.
See a lot of Asian chicks,

2193
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:47,800
mountains skiing.
I know how much you love to ski.

2194
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:50,060
If there was a redheaded Asian,

2195
02:06:50,190 --> 02:06:53,170
I think that would be the best
combination of Pantera. Do you ever see,

2196
02:06:53,190 --> 02:06:58,190
cause I saw a blonde Asian in San Diego
and it was such a weird combo that

2197
02:06:58,890 --> 02:06:59,270
that's,

2198
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:03,950
that's rare if I was blonde bleach
blond or was it a freak of nature?

2199
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,860
It was,
it looked like white hair.

2200
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:11,570
Like I looked like matrix that the guys
from the matrix shoot bleached white

2201
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:16,070
bleached it and it was really cool cause
it was like a blonde girl that looked

2202
02:07:16,071 --> 02:07:18,410
like an alien till you
get down to those pubes.

2203
02:07:18,770 --> 02:07:22,360
Those buttle here is that she
hasn't kept up with, yeah,

2204
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:23,900
just don't have hair.

2205
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:28,530
They don't know that they were
designed to try to get rid of the RFA.

2206
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:30,200
There's,

2207
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:34,010
there's different kinds of Asians but
like Stan hope there's a whole bit about

2208
02:07:34,030 --> 02:07:36,250
uh,
Asian porn about it being like,

2209
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:40,360
like rat Harris are like, is he, I
forget what he says. Rat whiskers.

2210
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:43,500
Pubes but they don't have like arm

2211
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:46,410
pit hair's usually or
the carers or face hair.

2212
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:49,890
Like you never say we're
talking about pubes so sorry.
Oh, no. I was talking about,

2213
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:51,490
oh wait,
I don't remember.

2214
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:58,120
San Diego is one of my
new favorite places to go.

2215
02:07:59,050 --> 02:08:02,260
Hanging out at the American comedy
company made me realize like how,

2216
02:08:02,261 --> 02:08:06,160
what a great spot that is. Like that
whole area, that little hangout area,

2217
02:08:07,710 --> 02:08:10,650
that area call it again, remember
where all the bars where it's call it.

2218
02:08:10,690 --> 02:08:13,570
What's that area? Brewery. Not The
brewery district. That's Columbus.

2219
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:18,550
You're your San Diego. Gaslamp gas gas.
I've just seen such a great spot, man.

2220
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:20,680
We were just there for a,

2221
02:08:20,681 --> 02:08:24,020
we did some shows in American
comedy company and we were
like, what a nice area.

2222
02:08:24,021 --> 02:08:26,860
It says like everybody's walking around.
It's like really cool.

2223
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:30,220
I like the Indian dentist hotel by
the way. That places. Yeah. Nice.

2224
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:35,100
It's that 10 year, 15 years ago. That was
like skid row. Really? The whole thing.

2225
02:08:35,970 --> 02:08:36,860
That's where,

2226
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:41,940
that's where I like more
Republican government,

2227
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:45,840
you know? That's why I like like
conservative government. That's why.

2228
02:08:45,841 --> 02:08:48,630
That's one of the things I like about
a place like San Diego and its military

2229
02:08:48,631 --> 02:08:51,510
presence.
They like have way less bullshit going on.

2230
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:54,030
Oh yeah. You know, San Diego is like,

2231
02:08:54,031 --> 02:08:57,630
even even when like there'll be
some at the bar Saturday night,

2232
02:08:57,631 --> 02:09:00,060
there'll be some guys that lightly this
and they'll be some fights and stuff.

2233
02:09:00,061 --> 02:09:02,760
But it's pretty well policed.
I mean like,

2234
02:09:02,761 --> 02:09:05,160
and it's not like I never let
it get to be where skid row is.

2235
02:09:05,210 --> 02:09:08,630
Anello they would never let it get that
far. The La skid rows were digitals.

2236
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:11,610
It's crazy.
I think it wouldn't happen in San Diego.

2237
02:09:11,611 --> 02:09:14,220
They would never let it happen.
And there's some bad things about that.

2238
02:09:14,221 --> 02:09:16,980
Like where they keep trying to close
the pot shops down and they, you know,

2239
02:09:16,981 --> 02:09:21,270
rest people for, they're really
aggressive by alcohol after midnight,

2240
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:25,110
unless it's at a bar. They're aggressive
about that. But you know what,

2241
02:09:25,111 --> 02:09:28,800
that's how you keep a nice
community. That sucks. But it's true.

2242
02:09:28,950 --> 02:09:30,930
That's the only way they
could make downtown work.

2243
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:35,940
Downtown was crazy before then.
Wow. So what started the change?

2244
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:39,480
There was just some developers
came in and were like, listen,

2245
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:42,900
we're going to pump a ton of money into
downtown. If you give us the permits,

2246
02:09:42,901 --> 02:09:45,780
we'll pump the money and why.
And so our government,

2247
02:09:45,810 --> 02:09:48,300
I mean now our governments
all fucked and San Diego, but,

2248
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:49,860
but what's wrong with it now?

2249
02:09:50,010 --> 02:09:54,450
I'll all the hell that councilman
stuff got busted for like, Oh yeah,

2250
02:09:54,451 --> 02:09:58,050
he's trying to fuck her and
stuff. Yeah. So we're broke now.

2251
02:09:58,070 --> 02:10:03,000
Cities actually kind of let banks,
did he get sued that and uh,

2252
02:10:03,030 --> 02:10:07,350
he handed out some contracts to do
through on strip clubs and stuff. Oh no,

2253
02:10:07,351 --> 02:10:12,040
he didn't really, there was a bunch
of shit. Oh that's beautiful. Yeah,

2254
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:16,380
he was rocking it. Old School.
Yeah. Oh yeah. Old School
corruption style. They were,

2255
02:10:16,410 --> 02:10:20,430
he was trading contracts
basically for hookers. Whoa.

2256
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:22,620
Like the strippers would,
you know,

2257
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:27,030
like he go and they'd fuck him and
strip for him and all kinds of shit.

2258
02:10:27,031 --> 02:10:30,990
And then he would hand out contracts to
the owners and he's living like a king.

2259
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:34,020
So when he came along, that was Hayden. I

2260
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:36,650
obviously had a good racket and
they were hating on him. Dude.

2261
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:40,040
Everything was going fine.
It's a good place to live.

2262
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:44,750
Guy Like that run and shit is going to
be happy all the time. So, but yeah,

2263
02:10:44,751 --> 02:10:49,430
downtown they totally like revitalized it.
And so it was just these one group,

2264
02:10:49,431 --> 02:10:51,330
this one group of developers that just uh,

2265
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:55,370
starting with the money and then it
all, it's amazing. It's amazing. Yeah.

2266
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:57,350
It's something to learn from.
Cause I, I'll tell you that, uh,

2267
02:10:57,351 --> 02:11:01,520
that place where we're, the
American comedy comedy is,
is really awesome and fun.

2268
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:06,080
Yeah. It's really cool cause that Brian's,
that a chicken and waffle place. 24.

2269
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:09,530
Oh Jesus. Right next door to it.
Yup. So fucking sweet area man.

2270
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:11,320
And there's a lot big
police presence there too.

2271
02:11:11,321 --> 02:11:15,980
A lot of cops we saw tons by the way,
which is good. Keeps people from Duchenne.

2272
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:18,670
Yeah. But no, no place to
smoke weed. But that knowing

2273
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:24,800
anywhere in San Diego, this isn't that
bad. Dewey. Yeah. They don't fuck around.

2274
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:28,340
They don't fuck around. They treat it
like it's like cocaine or something. Yeah.

2275
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:33,050
Same say coke. Wow. They go federal,
they go federal on you in San Diego.

2276
02:11:33,110 --> 02:11:36,850
They don't have to and they do. Really?
Yeah. How bad do they do it? Like,

2277
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:40,430
what did they, do anybody know
anybody who's been arrested yet? Or,

2278
02:11:40,540 --> 02:11:45,460
my buddy was just smoking a joint on
the street. I'm stupidly, he's drunk,

2279
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:50,200
snow, smoking a joint on the street
and he was in jail for five days. Uh,

2280
02:11:50,230 --> 02:11:54,170
he had like all kinds of charges
brought up on them. Like, oh they,

2281
02:11:54,390 --> 02:11:57,210
they like bullshit stuff like
intent to sell and stuff. Like,

2282
02:11:57,220 --> 02:12:00,520
like stuff where he's just a guy smoking
a joint on the street, you know? Wow.

2283
02:12:00,521 --> 02:12:04,330
I was sweating a lot of joints
this weekend. They just try to,

2284
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:07,210
oh one big conventions come in.
Then they're chill.

2285
02:12:07,690 --> 02:12:10,840
Oh, they play Nice, nice
comicon. You're not gonna,

2286
02:12:10,841 --> 02:12:13,780
you're not gonna get busted for anyone.
Wow. That's weird. That's even creepier.

2287
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:16,220
So this guy was in jail for five days.
Did you?

2288
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:18,090
Five days is it,
couldn't figure out why they,

2289
02:12:18,290 --> 02:12:21,620
like they kept saying he can leads like
window it. He was broke. So He's like,

2290
02:12:21,621 --> 02:12:24,140
what? He's like, when do I get
out there? Like, I'm not sure.

2291
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:26,600
They're like held him for five days.
Why did they do that?

2292
02:12:26,700 --> 02:12:28,860
Because they just wanted to make a point.
I mean they did.

2293
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:31,060
So they don't even charge you with
anything. They're just hold you.

2294
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:34,190
He ended up getting charged. I can't
remember. He got charged for, but he had,

2295
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:38,000
he had it. It was a big fine, you know,
it's like a shitload of community service.

2296
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:41,200
It was like worse than getting
a Dui. Wow. That's correct.

2297
02:12:41,230 --> 02:12:45,140
We're just smoking one joint. Jungo was
us. So maybe like a year and a half ago.

2298
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:48,140
Wow. Fuck. San Diego.

2299
02:12:50,910 --> 02:12:51,930
Real life.
Yeah.

2300
02:12:52,050 --> 02:12:55,220
That's really do that in the state of
California because the state of California

2301
02:12:55,221 --> 02:12:58,730
is really, when it comes to
drugs, especially when it
comes to schedule one stuff,

2302
02:12:58,731 --> 02:13:01,970
which means scheduling on means that it
doesn't mean it's the most dangerous,

2303
02:13:01,971 --> 02:13:05,480
but it means that it's,
it has no medical purpose.

2304
02:13:05,870 --> 02:13:10,310
So like the thing about marijuana is it's
lumped in there with like crystal meth

2305
02:13:10,311 --> 02:13:11,570
and things that are useless.

2306
02:13:11,870 --> 02:13:14,390
It's a lot of like lumped in
there with like the worst drugs.

2307
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:15,620
The idea is that it's,

2308
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:20,370
it has no value but then scheduled to
his cocaine scheduled to his heroin

2309
02:13:20,371 --> 02:13:24,080
because there's medical
uses for them. Wow. Yeah.

2310
02:13:24,081 --> 02:13:26,660
So it's fuck that.
It's ridiculous.

2311
02:13:26,661 --> 02:13:31,661
So federally they're allowed to
go after it as a federal crime,

2312
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:36,630
even if under the state, you know, it's
legal. It's a very tricky situation.

2313
02:13:36,631 --> 02:13:41,070
Like the DEA can always come in and
bust these medical marijuana places

2314
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:44,140
federally because federally
it's a schedule one drug.

2315
02:13:44,141 --> 02:13:48,540
Still the classifications insane. I
mean it's, at this point in time, look,

2316
02:13:48,541 --> 02:13:52,770
first of all, Tommy Chong
guy on our phone, our show
is perfect example of that.

2317
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:56,550
He's been using this hemp oil to a,
to treat his cancer.

2318
02:13:56,551 --> 02:14:00,900
He has cancer of the prostate. Yeah.
And He's, he's 99% cancer free now.

2319
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:04,890
Holy Shit. Yeah. And he's been using
this hemp boy shit and the psych,

2320
02:14:04,891 --> 02:14:08,430
I just use it religiously. I changed my
diet. I started eating healthy and boom.

2321
02:14:09,630 --> 02:14:10,463
Hmm.

2322
02:14:10,550 --> 02:14:14,540
Sons of bitches and the federal government
would come in and make that illegal.

2323
02:14:14,780 --> 02:14:19,100
My cousin is a farmer in Brooklyn.

2324
02:14:20,210 --> 02:14:24,590
Yeah, exactly. Now he's a farmer up by
humble. Uh, they, oh Jesus. He has a real,

2325
02:14:24,610 --> 02:14:28,040
he's a for real, but he sells
to like dispensary's and stuff.

2326
02:14:28,041 --> 02:14:30,890
So it's like kind of on the up and up.
I mean he sort of, he didn't always,

2327
02:14:30,891 --> 02:14:32,750
but he's, he told me, he's like, yeah,

2328
02:14:32,751 --> 02:14:36,230
at any time the feds come in here
and throw me in jail like crazy.

2329
02:14:36,231 --> 02:14:37,970
And they take all your money.
Yeah.

2330
02:14:38,180 --> 02:14:41,210
And they just choose one to do it.
And anybody that's making any noise,

2331
02:14:41,480 --> 02:14:45,830
like they had that show, we'd wars
remember that show? Yeah. Well I saw that.

2332
02:14:45,870 --> 02:14:47,390
I'm like they're going to get Boston.
Boom.

2333
02:14:47,391 --> 02:14:50,300
They got busted like right
after the show got. Yeah.

2334
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:53,270
But the guy who made it was one of the
guys that were featuring on the show.

2335
02:14:53,271 --> 02:14:56,270
Who's your head? He runs this
big medical marijuana dispensary.

2336
02:14:56,720 --> 02:14:57,531
And when you run a,

2337
02:14:57,531 --> 02:15:01,340
I mean I think there's something somewhere
in the provisions where it's like

2338
02:15:01,341 --> 02:15:03,200
you're not supposed to
make like a lot of profit.

2339
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:07,310
And so like when you are a part of a big
thing of medical marijuana collective,

2340
02:15:07,311 --> 02:15:10,100
you're responsible for,
even though a lot of money is coming in,

2341
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:13,550
you have to like make sure that it goes
to places like goes to like you have to

2342
02:15:13,551 --> 02:15:15,110
give some of it away to charity,

2343
02:15:15,111 --> 02:15:17,960
pay your employee and he can't
make it a lot of money off of it.

2344
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:20,300
And when there's millions of dollars made,

2345
02:15:20,301 --> 02:15:21,890
they just assume you're
making a lot of money.

2346
02:15:21,891 --> 02:15:24,650
It doesn't matter what you're doing with
the numbers, whether it's legit or not,

2347
02:15:24,890 --> 02:15:27,290
in their opinion, they're like, this
guy is too big. We've taken them down.

2348
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:28,550
And so they just go after you.

2349
02:15:28,730 --> 02:15:33,020
And if you have a safe by take your money
and fucking good luck and that back,

2350
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:35,840
they take all your pot and they
probably going to sell that, you know,

2351
02:15:35,841 --> 02:15:38,810
I don't know what they do with it. It's
if it's legal in the state, I mean,

2352
02:15:38,811 --> 02:15:42,170
who knows, who knows what they're
gonna do with it? I mean they, I mean,

2353
02:15:42,171 --> 02:15:45,120
why would they burn it when it's probably
worth millions of dollars? They would.

2354
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:46,213
What do you want to do here?

2355
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:50,010
Yeah. What has happened all
that pot. It's a good question.

2356
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:52,770
If you asked how many chunks
as they steal it, what happens?

2357
02:15:52,771 --> 02:15:57,510
Like they get a huge drug bust crossing
the border. They burn it. They burn it.

2358
02:15:57,540 --> 02:16:00,570
Yeah, they do in Mexico. I know they
burn it in Mexico. They burn the coke,

2359
02:16:00,571 --> 02:16:04,200
they burn, they burn. I don't
know if they do that anymore.

2360
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:09,280
Was it one was a one of the shows with
Anthony Bordain, I forget where he was.

2361
02:16:09,281 --> 02:16:11,710
He was in some South American
company country rather,

2362
02:16:11,711 --> 02:16:15,400
where they had this giant bust of cocaine
and he was there while they lit the

2363
02:16:15,401 --> 02:16:20,320
cocaine on fire. Yeah, and he was
like, you know, like they were all,

2364
02:16:20,321 --> 02:16:23,590
all the cops had thrown this stuff into
like this ditch and they going to like

2365
02:16:23,591 --> 02:16:25,420
pour gasoline on it and light on fire.
I'm like,

2366
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:30,250
I would not want to be anywhere in
any shape connected that fucking

2367
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:34,780
event that looks like it's causing some
drug dealers some serious fucking money

2368
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:39,010
and you're going to put that on a TV
show. I'd be like, Oh fuck that man.

2369
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:42,100
Not My show. Bitch. Did you read that
thing? There's a thing in New York

2370
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:44,720
Time magazine a couple
of weeks ago about this,

2371
02:16:44,721 --> 02:16:48,980
the biggest drug dealer in Mexico,
like drug cartel guy and uh,

2372
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:50,540
and what part of the essay?

2373
02:16:50,541 --> 02:16:54,350
They said that he was having trouble
figuring ways to get it to the u s so he

2374
02:16:54,351 --> 02:16:57,650
just kidnapped some scientists and
had them build him. A submarine

2375
02:16:58,430 --> 02:17:01,150
does ship fucking coke.
Oh.

2376
02:17:02,220 --> 02:17:05,840
Oh my God. Where did he
kidnap a scientist from? Ah,

2377
02:17:05,841 --> 02:17:07,250
I can't remember where they said,

2378
02:17:07,251 --> 02:17:09,410
but like you basically just grabbed
your scientist. He was like, hey,

2379
02:17:09,411 --> 02:17:11,810
build me a coke submarine.
Oh my God.

2380
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:16,840
Could you imagine exact fucking
job and are you going to get out?

2381
02:17:17,150 --> 02:17:18,260
They were going to let you free.

2382
02:17:18,261 --> 02:17:20,450
Why would he ever let you free
built him a coke submarines.

2383
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:24,890
He's going to let you free. You're in.
Once you build the cokes out marine,

2384
02:17:24,891 --> 02:17:29,360
you're in, as long as you keep producing
shit for him, maybe he'll keep you alive.

2385
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:32,590
Yeah. Eventually you're gonna run out of
Shit to do and you know too much. Yeah.

2386
02:17:32,660 --> 02:17:33,980
You know where the coke machines parked,

2387
02:17:35,250 --> 02:17:39,110
they gotta fucking coke machine that goes
underwater. I mean that's what it is.

2388
02:17:40,230 --> 02:17:43,220
It's a real live coke machine.
The crazy thing is, is like

2389
02:17:43,300 --> 02:17:45,880
how much money is he
making that he's just like,

2390
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:48,550
I don't know if this is going to work
or not, but just here's a couple of Mil.

2391
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,460
Probably even more than that.
It's probably many,

2392
02:17:52,461 --> 02:17:54,410
many millions to create a submarine.

2393
02:17:54,740 --> 02:17:57,440
I mean have to bring in
some serious engineers.

2394
02:17:57,710 --> 02:18:00,980
You'd have to bring in some fabricators.
Me, you want to start from scratch?

2395
02:18:00,981 --> 02:18:01,910
Like how are you going to do this?

2396
02:18:01,911 --> 02:18:03,180
Where are you going to get
this submarine used to?

2397
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:06,230
You're really going to build one man.
That is no joke.

2398
02:18:06,231 --> 02:18:09,370
What's going to propel this thing? What
do you, what are you using for fuel? Oh,

2399
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:11,540
you're igniting an underwater,
you know what you're doing.

2400
02:18:13,590 --> 02:18:18,590
You need to have subs really specialized
education to build off fucking

2401
02:18:19,371 --> 02:18:23,090
submarine. All right. That's
no small achievement. No,

2402
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:26,260
you're going to have to call some
other people. Dude. I wonder how many,

2403
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:28,310
I wonder how many scientists he kidnapped

2404
02:18:29,010 --> 02:18:32,940
that. Yeah, it was crazy
cause it said that, uh,

2405
02:18:33,030 --> 02:18:37,080
it said that he had built these giant
tunnels underground that had like

2406
02:18:37,081 --> 02:18:39,270
bathrooms and, and, and all kinds of shit.

2407
02:18:39,510 --> 02:18:41,850
And then one of the tunnels got found out.
That's when he was like,

2408
02:18:41,851 --> 02:18:44,670
I'm so sick and tired of like
building these great tunnels.

2409
02:18:45,090 --> 02:18:46,200
I'm gonna build a submarine.

2410
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:50,800
Wow.
Wow.

2411
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:55,860
And imagine how terrifying it is to
being in a submarine filled with coke.

2412
02:18:55,930 --> 02:19:00,610
Oh my God. Dude in the ocean filled with
coke and you're totally, by the way,

2413
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:03,370
illegally there,
you're not supposed to be there.

2414
02:19:03,371 --> 02:19:06,700
So at any point in time they
can just light you up with
missiles from a distance,

2415
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:10,000
you know?
Also two dudes made it like under duress.

2416
02:19:10,090 --> 02:19:13,570
So that might be some problems with it.
It might be a bomb.

2417
02:19:13,571 --> 02:19:15,970
I might wait to get underwater
water and blow you up. You can't,

2418
02:19:15,971 --> 02:19:19,330
you may mill the fucking sub, but then
they'd probably killed the guy for sure.

2419
02:19:19,550 --> 02:19:24,400
Imagine if the sub blew up
till the guy who made it. Yeah,

2420
02:19:24,401 --> 02:19:27,380
they'd probably kill you anyway.
They really kill you if it blows up.

2421
02:19:27,830 --> 02:19:31,190
That's the thing. It's like if you do
too well working for a drug cartel,

2422
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:34,200
you're going to die. If you don't
do well enough, you're going to die.

2423
02:19:34,210 --> 02:19:37,370
That's terrible job really.
I really don't recommend it to anybody.

2424
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:39,970
It's the most chaotic idea ever.

2425
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:43,190
You're going to get involved in the
world of international drug selling.

2426
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:46,040
You know,
it's like the movie Scarface.

2427
02:19:46,190 --> 02:19:49,730
How many of future like crazy tycoon,

2428
02:19:49,731 --> 02:19:54,380
drug dealer dudes that movie
inspire and really bad rappers.

2429
02:19:56,030 --> 02:19:58,550
Do you remember the episode of the law?
Was it um,

2430
02:19:58,790 --> 02:20:02,630
Larry David curb your
enthusiasm? We had, I'm crazy. I,

2431
02:20:02,631 --> 02:20:04,670
Kyla is the rapper guy.

2432
02:20:06,030 --> 02:20:10,340
It's one of the funniest episodes ever.
It's really hilariously ridiculous.

2433
02:20:10,341 --> 02:20:13,880
Over the top rapper dude who
loves Scarface yet Scarface on 24,

2434
02:20:13,881 --> 02:20:14,990
seven in this house.

2435
02:20:17,710 --> 02:20:19,040
It was so perfect.

2436
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:24,830
What a shit way to make a living man
trying to sell coke. Fuck. Like, you know,

2437
02:20:24,831 --> 02:20:26,960
it's going to end and it's like,

2438
02:20:26,990 --> 02:20:30,380
it's like you're on a train and you don't
know where it's going to hit the wall,

2439
02:20:30,410 --> 02:20:32,750
but you know it's going to hit the wall,
but until it hits the wall,

2440
02:20:32,751 --> 02:20:35,720
you can party. Yeah. Well, that's
what they said. They said that,

2441
02:20:35,990 --> 02:20:37,340
so he lives this guy,

2442
02:20:37,341 --> 02:20:42,341
it seems El Chapo and he lives on the top
of a mountain somewhere in Mexico that

2443
02:20:42,411 --> 02:20:46,270
has just like guards all around it
and he just has like whores flown in.

2444
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:52,420
He has a whole soccer teams flown in
to play for him. Oh my God. Jesus.

2445
02:20:52,421 --> 02:20:55,610
But your basic prisoner, you
can't like go out to dinner. Yeah.

2446
02:20:55,611 --> 02:20:58,940
Well he serves sorta royal family
and said he's like a royal family.

2447
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:03,950
I mean basically right. We were talking
about earlier, very similar. Yeah.

2448
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:07,490
And why, why does it exist?
That's where it gets really cute.

2449
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:13,280
It's all because of the reason why
organized crime exploded in America,

2450
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:14,353
in the,
uh,

2451
02:21:14,450 --> 02:21:19,450
the early days of the 20th century was
because alcohol was illegal for a few

2452
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:22,940
years.
And during that prohibition,

2453
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,230
that's when the organized crime families
that were selling the alcohol got

2454
02:21:27,231 --> 02:21:30,290
strong cause they were making a fuck
load of money. Yeah. And then the,

2455
02:21:30,291 --> 02:21:33,530
once you have money, you have momentum,
you have momentum, you creating crime.

2456
02:21:33,531 --> 02:21:36,320
People are getting rich and there
was a lot of money in selling booze.

2457
02:21:36,321 --> 02:21:37,230
People want to boost.

2458
02:21:37,231 --> 02:21:40,310
The government was fucking stupid and
they tried to keep it from the people and

2459
02:21:40,311 --> 02:21:43,070
it became chaos. And that's
exactly what's going on in Mexico.

2460
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:46,610
A big part of what's going on in
Mexico is because of the drug war.

2461
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:50,210
And because Mexico is a poor country
that's right next to a rich country.

2462
02:21:50,211 --> 02:21:54,180
And the best way to make money when you
connect it to the rich country is seldom

2463
02:21:54,230 --> 02:21:55,070
illegal shit.

2464
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:59,120
Cause the best way is there some
shit that I have that you can't get.

2465
02:21:59,210 --> 02:22:03,620
You need heroin. That's funny. I have
heroin and then next thing you know it,

2466
02:22:03,621 --> 02:22:07,400
they're just selling you what you need.
It's, it's just supply and demand.

2467
02:22:07,730 --> 02:22:10,610
You know they are like hustling.
They're right next door to the machine.

2468
02:22:10,611 --> 02:22:12,440
What does the machine need?
The machine needs coke.

2469
02:22:12,441 --> 02:22:16,640
You've got to get a coke and you don't
even need to be like their product is so

2470
02:22:16,641 --> 02:22:20,420
good that you can have a fucking retard
sell it and he can sell out of it.

2471
02:22:20,690 --> 02:22:23,430
Like you don't even need talented.
Actually coke,

2472
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:25,830
coke gets those,

2473
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:30,090
the coke role starts happening and
people want more and more and more.

2474
02:22:30,091 --> 02:22:34,440
And you chasing the dragon with
it. That's a, it's a dark thing.

2475
02:22:34,441 --> 02:22:36,780
When you watch someone chasing that,
that Coke Dragon,

2476
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,920
it's a different thing than chasing
the heroin drag and the heroin drag.

2477
02:22:39,921 --> 02:22:42,750
And it seems like the people
are having actually having fun.

2478
02:22:42,770 --> 02:22:45,030
I like the heroines freaky
to me because it seems like,

2479
02:22:45,031 --> 02:22:48,150
like when you talk to people that
have had it and it had the experience,

2480
02:22:48,151 --> 02:22:52,400
like it sounds so beautiful. It did. It
doesn't seem like it. You know, it, it,

2481
02:22:52,460 --> 02:22:55,080
it remains at one point in time,

2482
02:22:55,110 --> 02:22:59,560
almost almost worth some aspect of the
loss that you're gonna get from these

2483
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:05,150
because it's such a mind blowingly
beautiful thing when you do get the trip,

2484
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:10,410
but it eventually a row erodes. Yeah. I
have a buddy who did a lot of heroin in,

2485
02:23:10,411 --> 02:23:13,410
in college and he like made it out and as,
and you know,

2486
02:23:13,411 --> 02:23:15,500
unless people are just like that
fucking evil dragon, hate it.

2487
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:18,270
Like when they talk about their
drug addictions, he was like, man,

2488
02:23:18,271 --> 02:23:22,980
heroin was so great. Yeah. He's like, I
can't do it cause it just fucked me up.

2489
02:23:22,981 --> 02:23:24,990
But like it was so great.

2490
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:28,200
It's supposed to be like the most
beautiful loving feeling ever.

2491
02:23:28,201 --> 02:23:32,520
But it's such a trick because it's
horrendous for your fucking body.

2492
02:23:32,730 --> 02:23:36,530
It's horrendous. It's really dangerous.
What does it make addicted to it?

2493
02:23:36,531 --> 02:23:39,280
Do your teeth fall out if
you're on heroin? Meth.

2494
02:23:39,370 --> 02:23:41,190
He probably just not
taking care of yourself.

2495
02:23:41,191 --> 02:23:42,930
It's not like the drug
makes your teeth fall out.

2496
02:23:43,230 --> 02:23:47,990
He just become a fucking cockroach methods
and a lot of coconuts from grinding

2497
02:23:47,991 --> 02:23:51,390
her teeth and stuff like that.
God, yeah, that's fucked up.

2498
02:23:51,391 --> 02:23:55,170
How many drugs there are that can
jack you legal or illegal. It's just,

2499
02:23:55,171 --> 02:24:00,030
it's amazing how many things that we
become physically connected to and you

2500
02:24:00,031 --> 02:24:03,630
know, and it's, I don't understand
the physio, the physical part of it.

2501
02:24:03,780 --> 02:24:08,220
I can completely understand like people
that are obsessed with things and get

2502
02:24:08,221 --> 02:24:10,110
gambling addictions and
things along those lines.

2503
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:13,290
I can understand that kind of addiction,
but the physical addiction doesn't,

2504
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:15,960
it doesn't. I don't have
that, that that gene,

2505
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:18,480
whether it's for alcohol or a
cigarette or I don't have that,

2506
02:24:18,481 --> 02:24:21,030
but I know people who do,
they can't do anything.

2507
02:24:21,090 --> 02:24:25,740
They can't have a one simple sip of
wine and then next thing you know,

2508
02:24:25,741 --> 02:24:29,790
they'll be on this nutty downward spiral
where they're doing shots and they're

2509
02:24:29,791 --> 02:24:33,480
out of control and they're saying things
they'll never remember it. I mean,

2510
02:24:33,510 --> 02:24:37,800
that's how, that's a weird
fucking aspect of being a human.

2511
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:42,630
It's got to be genetic. Partly
genetic. What's the benefit
of it? It's weird. Yeah.

2512
02:24:42,631 --> 02:24:44,730
I Dunno.
What's that?

2513
02:24:44,731 --> 02:24:48,270
What's the drug that people are taking
it and they're like eating people's faces

2514
02:24:48,271 --> 02:24:51,910
off bath salts. That's right. What the
fuck is bath salt? Yeah, we'll the,

2515
02:24:51,911 --> 02:24:54,720
it's funny that the cops are
trying to pretend that it was weed.

2516
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:58,110
Like if that guy was on weed and
he did that, he's just an asshole.

2517
02:24:58,111 --> 02:24:59,520
It doesn't matter what drug is taken.

2518
02:24:59,521 --> 02:25:01,590
It's not weed swinging
it eat someone's face.

2519
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:05,430
I think it was just he was a crazy
person. It could be that too. Yeah.

2520
02:25:05,431 --> 02:25:07,860
It could not.
It doesn't have to just be under the bath.

2521
02:25:07,861 --> 02:25:10,320
Salts aren't detectable
because it's not exactly,

2522
02:25:10,321 --> 02:25:12,240
don't even know what the test is.
Exactly.

2523
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:15,480
Don't they don't have a test for it
cause it's all bunch of different shit.

2524
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:19,080
They apparently change molecules and
Kevin Pereira was explaining it to us

2525
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:20,820
scientifically they take,

2526
02:25:20,830 --> 02:25:24,160
can take any sort of a molecule and
they change it by an oxygen molecule.

2527
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:27,610
Doesn't necessarily change the effect
of the drug. It's still effective,

2528
02:25:27,611 --> 02:25:31,960
but it became, it becomes a
different trip. And in this
trip, you know there's one,

2529
02:25:31,961 --> 02:25:35,200
some people were doing some wacky shit
and you can buy it over the counter at

2530
02:25:35,201 --> 02:25:36,930
places you can buy it.
A,

2531
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:38,950
you know they called called
bath salts because you're not,

2532
02:25:39,010 --> 02:25:41,350
it says not for human consumption
so you can just buy it.

2533
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:45,220
That's how they get around selling. Right,
right. And then people smoke it sort of,

2534
02:25:45,370 --> 02:25:49,510
sort of, but you know, Salvia is just a
plant. Have you ever smoked Salvia? Yes.

2535
02:25:49,630 --> 02:25:50,463
Let's that like,

2536
02:25:50,710 --> 02:25:54,340
I don't know because I don't think
I had a really quick of machines. I,

2537
02:25:54,341 --> 02:25:59,050
I've talked to some people like Ari who
like thinks he might have lived like a

2538
02:25:59,051 --> 02:26:03,910
whole month at another and chin.
Then I'll say that again without coughing.

2539
02:26:03,930 --> 02:26:07,450
He, he felt like he lived a
whole month in another dimension.

2540
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:11,230
And then when he came back,
his instantaneous, um,

2541
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:16,680
like it was like he went in and out here
for five minutes and he remembers most

2542
02:26:18,641 --> 02:26:19,420
of the,

2543
02:26:19,420 --> 02:26:24,420
most of the time in that five minutes
as a month long journey that he had with

2544
02:26:24,761 --> 02:26:29,590
these families and he created friendships
and there's a great sense of loss when

2545
02:26:29,591 --> 02:26:32,920
the trip was over because he would never
see his friends again. Salvia. Yeah,

2546
02:26:32,990 --> 02:26:37,330
she said that, um, me and him had
a long talk about it when really,

2547
02:26:37,580 --> 02:26:41,160
because every time I've seen
him do to salvage, not that,
well, you don't know man.

2548
02:26:41,360 --> 02:26:44,650
Maybe he didn't tell you exactly what
happened and his fucking freaky little

2549
02:26:44,651 --> 02:26:46,450
five minute trip,
I didn't get there.

2550
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:49,330
Taco and he was drowning and he couldn't,

2551
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:53,460
people were looking at them and all
this other stuff. So not conscious.

2552
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:56,500
I don't know how many, it depends how,
it depends how deep you go and do it.

2553
02:26:56,501 --> 02:26:58,180
Like when, when I, when I've done it,

2554
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:00,730
I've done like the 40 times
or to 60 times Salvia.

2555
02:27:00,970 --> 02:27:04,120
And what it felt like to me is
if you've ever done like a whip,

2556
02:27:04,121 --> 02:27:07,440
it like a balloon where it's like Wah
Wah Wah Wah, like last, like whatever,

2557
02:27:07,450 --> 02:27:10,060
three minutes, five minutes. It
was like that. But of mushrooms,

2558
02:27:10,061 --> 02:27:14,260
like you're just getting thrown into the
most intense mushroom trip or acid trip

2559
02:27:14,261 --> 02:27:14,621
ever.

2560
02:27:14,621 --> 02:27:18,370
And then it goes away and
like five minutes and then
you just feel like shit for

2561
02:27:18,371 --> 02:27:21,460
like an hour or two hours afterwards.
He just kind of feel like crappy,

2562
02:27:21,461 --> 02:27:22,250
like worn out.

2563
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:24,390
Well you got to take a lot
of it and you've got to do,

2564
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,780
it's got to be strong and you
gotta to do it the right way.

2565
02:27:26,781 --> 02:27:29,700
It's gotta be heated to a certain
way. I didn't crack lighter. Yeah,

2566
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:30,650
I didn't get it right.

2567
02:27:30,830 --> 02:27:33,740
I got it to where it was like
how to add a body experience.

2568
02:27:33,770 --> 02:27:37,100
Just really simple out of body experience.
Like I was over my right shoulder,

2569
02:27:37,101 --> 02:27:40,710
like hovering, looking down at myself,
and then would come muck and waves.

2570
02:27:40,730 --> 02:27:43,340
I look at myself. And when
you from up, that was it.

2571
02:27:43,341 --> 02:27:44,870
And it only lasted for like five minutes.

2572
02:27:44,890 --> 02:27:47,990
And I think feel like it was longer
than five minutes. No, no, no.

2573
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:49,880
It felt pretty quick.
I didn't even feel time.

2574
02:27:49,881 --> 02:27:53,450
I don't think that's why I'm surprised
that Ari felt the said dad because you

2575
02:27:53,451 --> 02:27:55,790
don't really,
I don't think you ever even think of time.

2576
02:27:55,790 --> 02:27:59,570
You just feel like you're dead. Yeah. I'm
pretty sure. I'm pretty sure it's Ari.

2577
02:27:59,571 --> 02:28:00,650
I mean,
I don't,

2578
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:04,760
I can't believe I would fuck up and not
think that maybe it was somebody else,

2579
02:28:04,761 --> 02:28:08,030
but I'm pretty sure it was all right.
He said he had like a whole like,

2580
02:28:08,031 --> 02:28:11,800
month long friendships. That's not,
that doesn't seem like Salvia, well,

2581
02:28:11,810 --> 02:28:15,410
maybe it is, man. Maybe you just needed
to take it at the right time, you know?

2582
02:28:15,590 --> 02:28:18,950
Who knows? Trying hard enough to make
fucking friends and your trip. Yeah, man.

2583
02:28:18,951 --> 02:28:23,690
Maybe you're not really reaching out
while you're tripping. Hmm. I think, uh,

2584
02:28:23,750 --> 02:28:27,020
I think it's possible that, you
know, you get different Salvia,

2585
02:28:27,021 --> 02:28:31,660
that's different potency and you take it,
you know, see, this is more like salary.

2586
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:36,560
This is when I did it. This is you.
Yeah. Wait, this is actually you.

2587
02:28:36,660 --> 02:28:38,030
He's actually tramping here.

2588
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:45,710
You'll go,
you're taking a shit ugly.

2589
02:28:45,711 --> 02:28:47,910
You're shitting out sand seashells.

2590
02:28:47,960 --> 02:28:51,200
I was on a water slide or something like
that and I thought my face melted off.

2591
02:28:56,330 --> 02:28:57,163
How you feeling?

2592
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:03,280
Oh my God, Dude. Stop this embarrassing.
Played it before a million times. We,

2593
02:29:03,310 --> 02:29:07,930
you and I? Yeah. When we do,
I don't, no, I don't think
so. One of your other friends.

2594
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:11,340
It's ice house chronical. I wasn't
there. How dare you? No, I mean,

2595
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:12,970
you've seen this before.
I've showed it to you.

2596
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:15,340
I really don't think I've seen him.
Really? That's craziness. Yeah,

2597
02:29:15,341 --> 02:29:18,190
it was craziness. I've seen Ari's, I
saw already when he got mad at. Yeah.

2598
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:23,060
Let me just check. It's not good legal.
There you go. Bam. That Shit's illegal.

2599
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:26,950
Well, they didn't, that's
not 100% legal anymore. Well,

2600
02:29:26,951 --> 02:29:29,560
they're slowly starting to sneak it out,
but it's not scheduled.

2601
02:29:29,590 --> 02:29:32,590
It's not like schedule one, you know, it's
like me going sampling marijuana. Yeah.

2602
02:29:32,591 --> 02:29:35,290
They've started to make it
legal or illegal rather. Um,

2603
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:38,710
but they didn't know there's some
other shit that's, that's legal to,

2604
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:41,720
there's some stuff that they don't
know about that's like, you know,

2605
02:29:42,010 --> 02:29:45,640
five methoxy dimethyltryptamine that
slide that's legal. You can buy that.

2606
02:29:45,641 --> 02:29:46,990
He used to be able to buy it online.

2607
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:49,540
It used to be able to buy it from
a research chemical companies,

2608
02:29:49,930 --> 02:29:51,070
not for human consumption.

2609
02:29:51,100 --> 02:29:54,430
You'd be able to buy it online and
it would just blow your fucking mind.

2610
02:29:54,470 --> 02:29:56,920
You'd go to another dimension.
Totally legal.

2611
02:29:57,850 --> 02:30:01,150
That's not going to mean for human
consumption though. I think if you use it,

2612
02:30:01,180 --> 02:30:05,380
you actually in violation of the law by
virtue of the fact that it's chemically

2613
02:30:05,381 --> 02:30:07,120
related to something that's illegal,

2614
02:30:07,150 --> 02:30:10,560
it's like really close to her cousin
to something that's illegal. Yeah.

2615
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:14,380
Like what scientist is sitting there like
figuring out what the fuck you up that

2616
02:30:14,381 --> 02:30:18,120
night. Asshole scientist,
asshole scientists.

2617
02:30:18,121 --> 02:30:21,460
Creative bath salts to bag.
You know,

2618
02:30:21,461 --> 02:30:24,250
this dude's out there working on the
cure for aids and guys like, Nope,

2619
02:30:24,340 --> 02:30:26,710
I want some scarier meth.

2620
02:30:28,650 --> 02:30:32,440
Some method.
Even meth people would tell you to quit

2621
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:38,740
bath salts. We just getting
weirder and weirder as a society.

2622
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:42,520
Have you heard of Ken Com? Yes.
That's not real though. It's not. No.

2623
02:30:42,610 --> 02:30:45,230
It's like a lifestyle.
Yeah. It's fairly horseshit.

2624
02:30:46,030 --> 02:30:50,860
A drug that uh, they make
with a poop. Oh yeah,

2625
02:30:50,861 --> 02:30:54,460
that's fake. It's fake. Yeah.
Fuck. I wanted that to be real.

2626
02:30:54,470 --> 02:30:57,280
It just thought it was real too.
I thought it was real too.

2627
02:30:57,490 --> 02:31:00,690
I think maybe people have tried it,
but I don't think it works.

2628
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:02,830
It will trip you out

2629
02:31:05,950 --> 02:31:09,520
smelling shit. Dows your
drug of choice. Boy,

2630
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:12,520
when you want to talk about
like how bad Africa must suck,

2631
02:31:12,521 --> 02:31:16,480
that someone's willing to believe that
because you were saying in Detroit

2632
02:31:16,481 --> 02:31:19,740
they're smoking their own shit. He'd
be like, no, stop making that up.

2633
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:24,390
That's sniffing for shit water
to get high in Detroit. Stop it.

2634
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:28,170
But in Africa you're like,
well, they probably are. Yeah.

2635
02:31:28,171 --> 02:31:30,450
I mean they get to figuring out
some way to get fact up to there.

2636
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:35,340
You immediately assume they were right.
It seems like,

2637
02:31:35,370 --> 02:31:38,590
okay, what am, what else am I
supposed to believe? They smoke.

2638
02:31:39,590 --> 02:31:40,423
I smoke this shit.

2639
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:45,500
He ever seen the one video on a African
fish farming where they have like a pond

2640
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:51,900
filled with fish and the run in with
baskets. They, everyone runs in.

2641
02:31:51,901 --> 02:31:54,270
Everyone in the town runs in,
into the,

2642
02:31:54,540 --> 02:31:59,540
into the water and catches the fish
with nets and with their hands.

2643
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:05,040
Thousands of people. And they run in
and they catch every fish in this pond.

2644
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:08,970
It's a shallow pond. The catch them all
with their hands and baskets and shit.

2645
02:32:08,971 --> 02:32:11,940
And they do it all at
once. Huh? Who is it?

2646
02:32:12,810 --> 02:32:17,160
That's dot Merera powerful dot.
Merera let him come. Come on in.

2647
02:32:18,410 --> 02:32:21,720
They just run into the, yeah, it's crazy.
They run in. Have you seen that Brian?

2648
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:25,540
The video where the dudes in Africa,
they run into a,

2649
02:32:25,820 --> 02:32:29,430
upon the fish for it. Pull it up cause
it's crazy. See if you could find it.

2650
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:33,440
When I say African African pond,
uh,

2651
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:37,410
fishing with their hands.
Village.

2652
02:32:41,140 --> 02:32:45,710
Janka see if you can check 'em butthole.
Yeah.

2653
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:50,430
I don't know if you're going to
find it Lucia to no, that's not it.

2654
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:53,460
You know that Sunday? That's a little
girl. How dare you? I don't know.

2655
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:56,310
Africans catch fish with their hands.

2656
02:32:57,070 --> 02:33:00,350
Yeah.
You banging

2657
02:33:00,350 --> 02:33:04,830
it or is this a Google search?
Here's The fucking asteroid attack and,

2658
02:33:04,831 --> 02:33:08,390
and we're all just like back
to like basic civilization.

2659
02:33:08,391 --> 02:33:12,850
Like Africa is going to be like fucking
New York because they're the only ones

2660
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:13,880
you want to do anything.

2661
02:33:14,180 --> 02:33:17,780
I know they could still like the people
in the Congo that like catch fish by

2662
02:33:17,781 --> 02:33:20,150
hanging from trees.
Have you seen those guys?

2663
02:33:24,380 --> 02:33:27,460
Justin Helper and Justin Helpern
tomorrow. Nice to meet you. Dot.

2664
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:29,930
Merera shows up nice and
early for the super show,

2665
02:33:29,931 --> 02:33:33,650
which will be taking place in less than
one hour. Have a seat. Dumb, relaxed.

2666
02:33:33,651 --> 02:33:37,130
You've got a cocktail, you look
comfortable. You got your notebook.

2667
02:33:37,160 --> 02:33:41,720
The mother fucker never stopped writing.
Leverage. Laser gentlemen never stops.

2668
02:33:41,721 --> 02:33:46,440
He's a pro. Yeah. Any way you
want to sit. So Justin, let me,

2669
02:33:46,441 --> 02:33:48,590
let me, we're going to end this
podcast and we'll, we'll, uh,

2670
02:33:48,620 --> 02:33:51,350
start the icehouse chronicles in the
wild after we come back from a break.

2671
02:33:51,590 --> 02:33:56,390
But Justin, you have a new book out.
It's called I suck at girls. And,

2672
02:33:56,391 --> 02:34:00,590
uh, tell me why do soccer girls, you
seem like handsome, intelligent guy.

2673
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:02,930
I looked at the cover and I said,
this doesn't even make sense.

2674
02:34:03,140 --> 02:34:05,870
I can understand that you have a
crazy dad and he's very entertaining.

2675
02:34:06,230 --> 02:34:11,030
But what's just a misprint? Was this
supposed to be at? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2676
02:34:11,031 --> 02:34:15,770
That was the original title.
Uh, no. I mean it, most, it
takes place in the past. Uh,

2677
02:34:15,790 --> 02:34:18,040
I mean it's all chronicle
like nonfiction story.

2678
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:23,020
My Dad's in a lot of them. I'm
not stupid. He's in it. Um,

2679
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:26,860
yeah, I mean it's just basically like
a bunch of stories everybody has about,

2680
02:34:26,861 --> 02:34:30,390
you know, your fucking Shitty
proms and this then, you know, uh,

2681
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:31,780
losing your virginity.
And

2682
02:34:32,190 --> 02:34:36,120
do you ever worry about running
out of dad stories? A resource?

2683
02:34:36,121 --> 02:34:39,660
It's been very good to you
with that vein and dry it out.

2684
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:41,910
I know I might've tried it out with,

2685
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:51,310
maybe I have a few. Uh, I mean
it, yeah. I don't know. I figured,

2686
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:53,720
well, I'll let them all out there
and hopefully I won't need it

2687
02:34:53,770 --> 02:34:58,540
then we'll need it anymore.
That's my heroin. That's my
gen chem. Well, you know,

2688
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:01,380
as a guy trying to make
it as a screenwriter,

2689
02:35:01,390 --> 02:35:05,620
what a fucking awesome break that was
for you. The whole thing was just so,

2690
02:35:06,470 --> 02:35:10,960
it's so fortunate and so
interesting. Yeah. I love
when stories like that happen.

2691
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:14,740
I love when it shows that there's
a lot of like really talented,

2692
02:35:14,741 --> 02:35:17,620
funny people out there.
They just never do anything with it.

2693
02:35:17,830 --> 02:35:20,860
There's a lot of people out there that
are really funny and really talented,

2694
02:35:20,861 --> 02:35:23,480
but for whatever reason,
nothing clicks for them. They,

2695
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:28,390
they can't figure out how to make that
connection to it manifesting itself in

2696
02:35:28,391 --> 02:35:29,850
the real world.
It was just,

2697
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:33,550
they become these really funny people
that have jobs working for, you know,

2698
02:35:33,551 --> 02:35:36,130
whatever company I'm insurance
company or whatever it is,

2699
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:37,420
and for whatever reason,

2700
02:35:37,421 --> 02:35:41,170
they just never fucking figured
their way into the river. They never,

2701
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:46,060
never crawled to the bank. Just didn't
have the balls to jump in. It's too bad.

2702
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:51,430
I mean, for me it was just like,
it was such a crazy break. Right?

2703
02:35:51,431 --> 02:35:55,570
It was like lightning in a bottle and
then luckily I had sort of been doing,

2704
02:35:55,571 --> 02:35:59,080
I'd been writing for a few years, so
it was like, all right, well, you know,

2705
02:35:59,380 --> 02:36:02,040
let me get my shot. Like let me
get my, let me take my at bat

2706
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:06,550
surface. Yeah. Had that board. It's
beautiful. It's an awesome store.

2707
02:36:06,551 --> 02:36:10,630
I'd love hearing stories like that where
someone just is doing something good

2708
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:13,660
and just by virtue of the fact that other
people are telling other people and it

2709
02:36:13,661 --> 02:36:16,270
spreads and then then everybody hears
about it. That's how I heard about it.

2710
02:36:16,540 --> 02:36:20,080
I didn't read it in any publication
or anything. Everybody was like, dude,

2711
02:36:20,081 --> 02:36:22,360
check this out. This guy's
hilarious. And I would go check it.

2712
02:36:22,361 --> 02:36:24,970
I read a few of them laughed out
loud. I follow. This guy is funny.

2713
02:36:25,390 --> 02:36:27,250
It's funny how it happens,
man. It's beautiful.

2714
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:29,070
So there's a real organic occurrence.

2715
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:33,550
Oh, thanks man. Yeah, it's been, it's
definitely like a, it's funny too,

2716
02:36:33,551 --> 02:36:36,100
cause like after the TV show
got canceled, people like, Oh,

2717
02:36:36,101 --> 02:36:38,530
you must have been so fucking pissed.
I'm like dude,

2718
02:36:38,531 --> 02:36:41,660
I got a TV show on the air
for write down fucking shit.

2719
02:36:42,430 --> 02:36:47,020
Are you stupid?
I'm happy that everything like nothing,

2720
02:36:47,021 --> 02:36:49,450
you know, there's nothing that
was going to bum me out of it.

2721
02:36:49,590 --> 02:36:53,970
That's a great attitude. And that's
so important to, for success in life,

2722
02:36:53,971 --> 02:36:57,870
to have that kind of attitude and just
enjoy it and appreciate it. Work hard,

2723
02:36:57,871 --> 02:36:59,130
enjoy it and appreciate it.

2724
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:02,550
So many people and then something happens
and then it goes away from it and they

2725
02:37:02,551 --> 02:37:04,400
can never appreciate it.
They ever even did it. Yeah.

2726
02:37:04,401 --> 02:37:08,780
It's just neurosis trying to get to the
next level or stay on that level or you

2727
02:37:08,781 --> 02:37:11,850
know, get the next thing is you don't
feel like you're drowning, you know?

2728
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:16,160
So a show business is a very weird
world man. It's very weird. Yeah.

2729
02:37:16,161 --> 02:37:17,450
It's so funny too cause like,

2730
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:20,780
and since then have worked on a couple
of other shows, but on writing staffs,

2731
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:24,650
other shows and stuff and,
and I've seen like that's how it is.

2732
02:37:24,651 --> 02:37:27,050
Like every writer I work on
the show with, he's like, fuck,

2733
02:37:27,051 --> 02:37:30,680
this is so this is going to get
the fuck am I gonna do next year?

2734
02:37:31,130 --> 02:37:34,160
This is fucking bullshit. I hate
this job. And I'm like, dude,

2735
02:37:34,850 --> 02:37:39,830
like two years ago I was waiting tables.
Like that's kind of a shitty job.

2736
02:37:39,831 --> 02:37:44,570
Like we're sitting around making Dick
Jokes for fucking 12 hours a day for a TV

2737
02:37:44,571 --> 02:37:48,020
show. You're a writer on a
television show, like is there,

2738
02:37:48,021 --> 02:37:52,250
there's not that many more prestigious
positions in Hollywood besides actor and

2739
02:37:52,251 --> 02:37:56,930
producer, writer, a creator,
the person who, the creative
force behind the TV show,

2740
02:37:56,931 --> 02:38:00,080
that's fucking huge. There's not a
lot of people to get to do that. Yeah.

2741
02:38:00,110 --> 02:38:02,490
That's a massive, huge bill. Fuck,

2742
02:38:02,491 --> 02:38:05,900
I can't believe the shit is going to get
canceled. This fucking piece of shit.

2743
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:10,840
It's hard for people to appreciate
shit. It really is. Yeah.

2744
02:38:10,841 --> 02:38:14,090
Are a lot of negative content here.
And plus and in Hollywood,

2745
02:38:14,091 --> 02:38:18,530
it's also seems like unlike you,
where you just rode this, you know,

2746
02:38:18,531 --> 02:38:21,530
this opportunity and you capitalize
on and made the most of it.

2747
02:38:21,710 --> 02:38:26,600
Some people just get failure after
failure, after failure, after failure,

2748
02:38:26,601 --> 02:38:30,470
after minimal success. And by the time
they have a little bit of success,

2749
02:38:30,590 --> 02:38:34,100
there's so like condition to failure
and they're so worn down by it.

2750
02:38:34,610 --> 02:38:39,080
Their spirit is broken. Yeah. Oh,
they brought in cheeseburgers,

2751
02:38:39,170 --> 02:38:42,590
order food. He fucking
savage. Look at you.

2752
02:38:42,830 --> 02:38:47,300
You don't play games fucker.
Cow. Cow Can suck it.

2753
02:38:47,301 --> 02:38:51,320
And he got wings to Brian's like,
you're your die can suck my dick.

2754
02:38:51,380 --> 02:38:53,330
That's what he just
said. All right, let's,

2755
02:38:53,331 --> 02:38:57,920
let's wrap this thing up so Brian can
have his food. People want to follow you.

2756
02:38:57,921 --> 02:38:59,000
The actual you.

2757
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:03,560
It's just an underscore
Helpern at Twitter. Yep.

2758
02:39:03,890 --> 02:39:07,880
So, um, the other one, Shit my dad says
is just shit. It's still shit my dad says.

2759
02:39:07,960 --> 02:39:12,140
Right. And um, is there
anything else? Those are a
website that they should go to.

2760
02:39:12,980 --> 02:39:15,470
Now if they want to check out an
excerpt of the book, it's just a,

2761
02:39:15,471 --> 02:39:20,140
I suck at girl's book.com. Just go
buy the book on audible. Awesome.

2762
02:39:20,210 --> 02:39:22,760
Why play games? Yeah, we already
fucked that up. I was just going to,

2763
02:39:22,761 --> 02:39:23,950
if I was going to do the audible app,

2764
02:39:23,951 --> 02:39:27,950
I would have done at the beginning next
week we have four Comcast, so we'll,

2765
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:32,780

so, uh, the your site is, your website is,

2766
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:37,970
you don't have a website. Okay, so
Twitter, we've got that covered.

2767
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,840
You got a Facebook page? I don't,

2768
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:47,090
Is it over? Is it over? Brian?
I think you're better off
nowadays with the Tumbler.

2769
02:39:47,470 --> 02:39:50,120
A tumbler ups for glitter tax.

2770
02:39:51,350 --> 02:39:55,640
That's why I just for that alone for
animated gifs of drag is better than

2771
02:39:55,641 --> 02:39:59,960
Facebook wings of dragons. That carrier,
I don't use any of them anymore.

2772
02:40:00,130 --> 02:40:02,780
All right. Listen to dirty
bitches. This fucking shows over.

2773

podcast network that Brian runs.

2780
02:40:24,661 --> 02:40:26,130
That's his shit on the side.

2781
02:40:26,370 --> 02:40:30,100

Tuning into the show and, and,

2790
02:41:02,481 --> 02:41:04,370
and saying that you enjoy it is a,

2791
02:41:04,371 --> 02:41:06,870
the the best motivation we could
ever possibly have to do it.

2792
02:41:06,870 --> 02:41:11,640
It's a very unusual circumstances
we sort of stumbled into and uh,

2793
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:16,940
we sorta just wound up in this situation
when we're doing this podcast is not

2794
02:41:17,191 --> 02:41:20,940
planned out at all, but now that it's
become a part of so many people's lives,

2795
02:41:20,941 --> 02:41:24,210
I definitely feel obligated and
we're not going anywhere. So A,

2796
02:41:24,211 --> 02:41:27,270
we want to thank you guys thanks
to on a.com for sponsoring us.

2797
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:30,570

2798
02:41:30,571 --> 02:41:33,750
Rogan and save yourself 10%
of any of the supplements.

2799
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:35,670
It doesn't work with all the other shit.

2800
02:41:35,671 --> 02:41:38,520
Look at you over there while I'm talking
about supplements or eating the fries,

2801
02:41:40,290 --> 02:41:42,570
shoving them.
Dirty fries are so delicious.

2802
02:41:42,571 --> 02:41:44,160
Wouldn't it be awesome if
Fry's were good for you?

2803
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:47,550
That's what we need to get our
on scientists on. Yeah. No,

2804
02:41:47,551 --> 02:41:49,250
there wouldn't be the same
cause if fries are good for you,

2805
02:41:49,251 --> 02:41:53,700
you wouldn't feel as good. They
only feel, don't put them away.

2806
02:41:53,730 --> 02:41:58,470
I don't want it burger. Put it away. Put
