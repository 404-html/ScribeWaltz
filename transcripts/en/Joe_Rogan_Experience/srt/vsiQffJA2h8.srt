1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,910
Young James or in the long form we can 
do it.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,950
One we can do on Papa is a motherfucking
author.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,950
I'm a man of letters.
Now you're an author.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,813
I'm an author.
I've always admired that and secretly 

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,284
wished that I had not even so secretly 
wish that I had the discipline to write 

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,100
book.
You do have the discipline,

7
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,710
you just have to focus it on Mac.
You can do it.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,230
How long did it take you to write this?
About two years.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,080
That's too long.
No.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,110
Cut that shorter.
Oh,

11
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:42,990
okay.
Like a little pamphlet or flyer?

12
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,220
Just make a short.
This is all I could do.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,633
How long before you started writing the 
book did you think about writing the 

14
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,710
book?
Uh,

15
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,220
I've always kind of wanted to write a 
book.

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,120
I know.
Well yeah.

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,810
I'm this one.
I had pitched doing a book,

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,610
I don't know,
like six years ago.

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,010
Pretty much the same concept and no one 
was into it.

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,910
And then a couple of years ago through 
two,

21
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:12,510
three years ago,
a publisher contacted my agent,

22
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:14,310
whatever,
and they had interest.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,473
So we made a book deal and that changes 
everything because now someone is 

24
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,240
waiting for you,
you know,

25
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,270
you've got to turn stuff in and they 
make books and it probably smart and you

26
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:28,224
don't want to seem like an idiot.
Did you have an editor that like went 

27
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:32,250
over your stuff and said this is too 
long?

28
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,300
This is too short?
Yeah.

29
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,090
They were pretty great.
They were pretty.

30
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:36,924
They just left the material alone.
There was a couple little things where 

31
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:41,161
they're like,
you know,

32
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:45,190
you're repeating something or a that.
But mostly it was a,

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,050
a grammar kind of things.
Do you want to say it like this?

34
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,080
This isn't technically grammatically 
correct.

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,590
Typos,
that kind of stuff.

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,830
They were pretty hands off about the 
actual material.

37
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,470
And does it,
is it a book of essays?

38
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,390
Is it your life story?
What is it?

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,253
It's all on family.
It's called your dad stole my rake and 

40
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:11,520
other family dilemmas and it's broken 
down by,

41
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,980
uh,
by everyone in your family.

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,840
Like the basic thing is,
as a comedian,

43
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:16,674
I've been writing about family.
I'm looking at all everyone's families 

44
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,640
for so long.
So I'm going to write about all of them.

45
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,660
So it's moms,
dads,

46
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:22,680
cousins,
aunts,

47
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,720
uncles,
all broken down chapters like that.

48
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,740
And uh,
so I talked a little bit about my family

49
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,930
and then I just talk about funny essays 
about just life in general,

50
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:36,210
like going on family vacations or why 
are you eating your shirt?

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,240
Um,
I don't know exactly.

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,770
There's a really cool photographer,
Sam Jones who's decided to get wacky.

53
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,960
He just,
uh,

54
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,893
this guy is like this amazing 
photographer just done like clooney and 

55
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,460
Damon and all these people.

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,293
And uh,
I asked him if he would help him when I 

57
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:54,324
showed up.
We just taking some regular shots and 

58
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:56,784
he's like,
I have this idea and brought out this 

59
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:03,351
giant and put a tie on it and,
and just shot it.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,840
And it came up pretty funny.
It looked like dilbert or beaker.

61
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,430
I was just trying to figure out what 
you're doing,

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,273
I guess.
I guess what you're doing there is get 

63
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,420
people to try to figure out what you're 
doing there.

64
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,860
Yeah.
They stare at it and they're like,

65
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,900
maybe if I buy the book I'll figure it 
out.

66
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,901
I'll understand the puzzles deep inside 
I was being goofy.

67
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,050
When you write a book,
you have to think,

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,913
man,
someone could be reading this 30 years 

69
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:30,280
from now,
50 years from now,

70
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,990
that is as Comedians,
you write something in the morning,

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,350
you bring it on stage,
they tell you if it's funny or not.

72
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,660
You know what you're working with,
you go back and forth.

73
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,920
This is like,
it's permanent and no one gets to review

74
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:45,754
it until it's done.
So the nerve wracking part of it was 

75
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:50,441
like,
okay,

76
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:51,860
it's done.
I'm pretty proud of it.

77
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:54,670
I like edited it like crazy.
I've worked on it for a long time.

78
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,740
Will people think it's okay?
Will they not think it's hackable?

79
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,780
They think it's good with is the writing
okay.

80
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:05,420
All that other stuff and it's been out 
now for a week and uh,

81
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,020
the review,
I can tell the reviews are good.

82
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,943
Like the people are reviewing it and 
writing about it and calling and just 

83
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,790
people just randomly.
And it's,

84
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,693
I'm over the hurdle.
The anxiety of is this a good book is 

85
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,130
over?
Yeah.

86
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,453
People like it.
It's funny and it's people are saying I 

87
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:24,874
can,
right,

88
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,500
so that is huge.

89
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,680
It's just calm me down completely 
because you know,

90
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,300
like you said for 30 years,
whatever,

91
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:35,890
everybody's like takes a dump on it.
You'll have some that are really fucking

92
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:37,960
bad,
mean some comics,

93
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,203
someone should have just walked in while
they were running and grabbing them and 

94
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,450
you're doing something terrible for your
future.

95
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,270
This is going to be around for a long 
time.

96
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,820
People are going to refer to this 
forever.

97
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,793
People in these like really self 
righteous defensive modes and they're 

98
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:58,660
writing things down and maybe like five 
years from now they'd be like,

99
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:00,550
what the fuck was I thinking?
Yeah,

100
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,590
they're in the middle of writing it and 
I've read some,

101
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,990
some shit.
Oh my God.

102
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,040
Really?
Tab.

103
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,720
Yeah,
just horrible stuff.

104
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,651
Yeah,
I,

105
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,580
uh,
no.

106
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:10,414
I'm,
I'm,

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,430
I'm relieved.
I'm not excited.

108
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,190
I'm just relieved like Oh,
okay.

109
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,230
It's good.
It was good.

110
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:17,890
I thought it was good.

111
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,780
I hoped it was good.
My editor said it's good.

112
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,970
People are saying that the laughing when
they're reading it,

113
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,310
like editors who don't normally say that
kind of stuff.

114
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,000
So writing a book,
writing with writing stand up,

115
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,290
like how do you.
Ah,

116
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,690
how,
how'd you divide your time?

117
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,840
It was um,
it was tough.

118
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,330
You stand up whenever I'm working on 
something else,

119
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:39,790
stand up kind of.
I work on it at night,

120
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,400
you know,
and the book was,

121
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,910
I got into this rhythm of going in every
morning,

122
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,223
get up at seven,
go in with my coffee and sit there and 

123
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:50,554
that was booked time until noon.
I would try and just just work on that 

124
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,500
and make it a.
But that wasn't for two years.

125
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:00,500
That was like the last,
you know,

126
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,340
year to eight months kind of thing 
before that.

127
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:07,130
It's a little looser.
I'm trying to get it done and stuff.

128
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,610
But that real discipline of like coming 
in every morning,

129
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,340
sitting down and seven days a week just 
writing,

130
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,100
just write wherever I was,
whatever I was doing,

131
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:19,490
I had to make sure that I had that time.
If I'm on a plane with him in a hotel,

132
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,593
I'm on the road.
I was just writing the thing all the 

133
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,050
time.
It just became.

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,670
Because he's,
you know,

135
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,820
the biggest challenge for me,
and I think a lot of writers is that you

136
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,550
judge yourself as you go,
you're like,

137
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:34,840
is this good?
Is it to.

138
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,470
But you have to just get it down and 
know that it's bad.

139
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,513
Just just get it down.
I want to write this chapter on crazy 

140
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,364
ants,
so I'm just going to write it and spit 

141
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,650
it out and then I'm going to go to work 
on it like a bit,

142
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,401
you know,
like,

143
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:49,234
uh,
like stand up and just go back and just 

144
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:53,040
start editing and peeling back and 
peeling back,

145
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,360
getting rid of,
using when you're doing this.

146
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,990
I did it all on word,
Microsoft word and

147
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,503
scrivener.
Do you know what scribner and scribner 

148
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:06,220
is really interesting.
I did my last special on scrivener.

149
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,220
Oh yeah.
It was the first time I've used it for,

150
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,580
uh,
for running standup.

151
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,300
And what's good about it is on the left 
hand side you have a,

152
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,090
like all of your different subjects.
Yeah.

153
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,320
And you click on each subject and then 
there'll be a whole column.

154
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,640
So like I had the title strange times 
and then the left hand side,

155
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:25,474
this is,
this is what it looks like when you're 

156
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,840
looking at the chalk,
the cork board,

157
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,033
the corkboard is one aspect of it where 
you have these little cards like index 

158
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,870
cards and you said these index cards up 
and you know,

159
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:38,704
you're right.
All the different things on the index 

160
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:40,294
cards,
but you can organize it outside of the 

161
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,354
index cards.
There's also on each index to index the 

162
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,703
corkboard.

163
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,100
It corresponds to each individual 
subject,

164
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,550
like say like say if I'm doing a bid on 
desks,

165
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,030
right?
So I have desks on the lefthand side and

166
00:07:58,031 --> 00:08:00,370
then I'll write out all the stuff on 
desks,

167
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:03,220
but there's also a corkboard tab.
Right.

168
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,183
And then so I have all the different 
things to make sure that I covered all 

169
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:08,290
the notes.
Good Dude.

170
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,460
I like it a lot.
Yeah,

171
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,510
I'm going to try that.
What I like in life,

172
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,630
this is not really showing why I like 
it,

173
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,503
I like it is because you can have.
You can move all those little chapters 

174
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:21,880
around and move all the bits around.
Like for standup.

175
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,980
That's great.
That's really good.

176
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,863
Yeah.

177
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,500
The organizing it gets so in your head 
starts bogging you down.

178
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,990
But the good thing about this was that 
it was essays,

179
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,510
so each one's like four or five pages,
right.

180
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,960
So I would just be like literally just 
open up the file and go dad's,

181
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,340
alright,
I'm going to go to work on this one,

182
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,200
Dad,
no gifts for dad.

183
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,840
And then just boom,
just edit that,

184
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,520
put it away,
go to the next,

185
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
you know,
just I could just bounce it.

186
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,170
I didn't when I'm trying to say is I 
didn't have to keep track like a novel.

187
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,180
It didn't have 300 pages of flow,
you know,

188
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:01,920
they were all just hits so it was kinda 
similar to stand up that way.

189
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,500
You know,
like I could just go to work on them.

190
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,270
But it's fascinating.
I,

191
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,903
I really loved it.
Like I've had friends that have written 

192
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:10,884
books,
like Collin Quinn came and did a book 

193
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,210
event with me a couple of weeks ago and 
he's like,

194
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:15,970
and he wrote a book.

195
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,220
He's like,
I'll never do it again.

196
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,750
I just hated it.
I couldn't stand it.

197
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,100
I hate it,
and he's a prolific guy.

198
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:20,934
He writes a lot for his one man show.
He's always right and showing US 

199
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,130
history.
Yeah,

200
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,993
the guy writes a lot,
but the writing for the book drove him 

201
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,680
crazy.
I really loved it.

202
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,573
I couldn't believe that you could look 
at a five page essay and find something 

203
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,460
wrong with it.
Every time you looked at it,

204
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,100
every time.
Why am I saying this?

205
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:43,120
They know this.
Why do I have to say he?

206
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,140
He sat down at the table and ate his 
breakfast.

207
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,700
He ate his breakfast.
You know,

208
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:48,534
like you could just peel stuff away all 
the time and get it as as a direct as 

209
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:54,264
possible,
and I started to really just love the 

210
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,623
love that Jordan Peterson told me.
He wrote his first book and it took him 

211
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:05,451
15 years because he went over every 
single line every single day,

212
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,593
like a critic trying to find fault in 
everything that he did until he felt 

213
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,070
like he got it done.

214
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,903
It was on a cold war.
She really wanted to make sure that he 

215
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,340
had the subject matter completely locked
down.

216
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,750
Yeah,
that's daunting.

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,630
You're dealing with something that 
people can fact check.

218
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,793
People can fact check what happened to 
me and putting my sister in a garbage 

219
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,290
can in fourth grade.
You know what I mean?

220
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,370
Yeah.
It was family.

221
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:30,204
It's all about family.
It's all about like the joy of being 

222
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:33,204
with other people and,
and the aggravations and all that kind 

223
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:36,540
of stuff.
So it was just.

224
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,200
And I write,
I,

225
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,840
you know,
I have a lot of that in my act,

226
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,260
so it was definitely in my wheelhouse.
Like I'm not reading,

227
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,660
I'm not reading books about the Cold 
War.

228
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,910
You're going to write another one?
I am going to write another one.

229
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:49,140
Have you started yet?
Uh,

230
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:51,510
no I haven't.
Which is a,

231
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,523
I have a couple ideas and uh,
and the publisher wants me to write 

232
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:58,040
another one already.

233
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,640
Didn't want you to write another one.
Yeah,

234
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,080
I think a good sign.
Yeah,

235
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,400
that's a good sign.
It's,

236
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,940
we're the number one new release and 
family humor.

237
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,873
Ooh.
So it's like you had any potty words in 

238
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,440
there?
Very little.

239
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,960
Very little.
Like 10.

240
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,290
And it would be a lot cottony see words 
in there.

241
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,450
Which one?
The cunt word.

242
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,490
Oh my Lord.
Yes.

243
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,590
There's a whole.
There's a whole chapter.

244
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,080
This is the problem with family,
female,

245
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,470
just period now it's uh,
it's actually pretty clean.

246
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:35,844
I don't know if there's A.
I don't know if there's anything in 

247
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,710
there that I think there might be one or
two words.

248
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,820
One or two.
Questionable.

249
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,340
Yeah,
there might be a shit or A.

250
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,590
Yeah,
I don't think so though.

251
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,440
It's pretty clean.
Yeah.

252
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,960
Good for you.
And he put anything in there on bread?

253
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,980
Yes,
there is.

254
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,390
Yes.
The final chapter is a.

255
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,380
just eat the bread.
Really?

256
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,273
Yeah.
It's called just eat the bread and it's 

257
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,733
all.
It's all a chapter of basically using 

258
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,220
bread as a metaphor for just enjoy your 
life.

259
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,390
Right?
Don't,

260
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,940
don't turn it away.
Don't get all balled up.

261
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,980
Once in a while.
Just a little.

262
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:18,340
Just do it.
Should I segue into my big announcement?

263
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,233
You've got a big announcement.
I have a huge Joe Rogan podcast 

264
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,650
announcement.
What is huge?

265
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,723
The book is huge and it's a great 
father's day gift and everybody should 

266
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,853
buy it.
But as we all know from being on the 

267
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:33,650
show that,
uh,

268
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,590
I am the salt and of sourdough.
Yes.

269
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,603
And my reputation as a baker is because 
of the show hands down from doing your 

270
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:43,474
show.
Your fans are so awesome and started 

271
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:46,684
just sending pictures of their bread.
We have this nonstop relationship of 

272
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:50,531
help.
Fred,

273
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,090
they show me their failures.

274
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,490
They're constantly sending these 
interactions.

275
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,650
I'm in cities.
People are bringing bread.

276
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,113
And when I would travel I would go in 
and visit bakeries when I was on the 

277
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:02,494
road.
So the big announcement is the food 

278
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,790
network,
uh,

279
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,600
asked me to do a show about bread and 
baked goods.

280
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,613
Whoa.
So I have a new show coming out on the 

281
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:17,740
food network on Labor Day called baked 
with Tom Papa.

282
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,230
Wow.
And I travel around,

283
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,600
kind of like a diner's driving kind of 
thing,

284
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,434
but with all baked goods and meeting 
these amazing people that make the 

285
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:28,090
stuff,
getting their stories,

286
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:28,924
these families,
these Turkish families in Italian 

287
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:31,810
families or whatever.
And then,

288
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,450
uh,
showing all of this amazing,

289
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,930
amazing stuff that they're making all 
because of this show.

290
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,460
Why?
I have to thank you.

291
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,780
One hundred percent.
It is,

292
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,460
it was a hobby of mine that I completely
loved and got into.

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,640
But after doing this,
it just kind of exploded.

294
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,770
And uh,
and now we're going to be.

295
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,380
I just finished shooting them all.
That's awesome.

296
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:54,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

297
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,323
How many do you shoot?
We shot eight into ward eight different 

298
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,740
cities,
New Orleans,

299
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,660
New York,
Detroit,

300
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,030
La,
cleveland,

301
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,080
a Philadelphia,
New Jersey,

302
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,360
northern New Jersey,
which is where I grew up.

303
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,880
Uh,
yeah,

304
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,120
eight different ones.
It's going to stay in labor.

305
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,490
It so silly.
I mean,

306
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:16,540
literally,
you know,

307
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,790
how many.
I've been writing scripts.

308
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,624
I've been auditioning,
I've been acting whatever to compete on 

309
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:24,970
television.
I started making bread with my daughter.

310
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,750
That's,
that's my show.

311
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,900
It seems like that's the best way.
Anyway.

312
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,140
It's the thing that you actually enjoy 
and really love,

313
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,670
you know,
a 100 percent.

314
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:37,504
Find that thing that you're really 
passionate about and turn that into a 

315
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,920
show rather than.
Yeah,

316
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,783
some Sitcom that you're really not that 
excited about other than being on 

317
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:46,090
television.

318
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,100
That's exactly right.
Like I had no,

319
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,800
I was doing this anyway.
I didn't have any of the,

320
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,190
of trying to get a show on the air.
Like when I've written pilots and you're

321
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:55,511
like,
oh,

322
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,344
I hope it go.
This was just so natural because it's 

323
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:02,390
just what I'm doing.
So it completely.

324
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,224
And you hear that a lot.
We'll just will come from something you 

325
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,340
love and something and you hear that a 
lot.

326
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,174
You're like,
well I love working in an office and 

327
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,280
having a girlfriend.
I'll make a show about that.

328
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:13,911
No,
you don't.

329
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:17,390
Not really,
you know,

330
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,460
really.
But uh,

331
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,260
but that,
this actually just it,

332
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,810
you can't force it.
It's just,

333
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,730
it's just organic.
And this one was organic.

334
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,440
Did you link up those different cities 
with comedy shows?

335
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:32,450
Did you do standup in those cities when 
you were traveling?

336
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:36,980
I did just like pop in and Neil Brandon 
and I did a show in New Orleans.

337
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,430
I did a show in Cleveland when I was 
there just as like pop in.

338
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,350
I didn't like promote it.
And do it while it was there.

339
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:44,400
So you just concentrating on filming?
Yeah,

340
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,730
I was just concentrating on film and 
we'd go in for like three days.

341
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,710
I'd meet like four or five different 
bakers and uh,

342
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,360
it was cool.
Just,

343
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,233
you know,
just dealing with these people is 

344
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,730
amazing.
That's awesome man.

345
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,120
No one gets into baking because they're 
an asshole,

346
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,613
you know what I mean?
No one says I'm going to bake cookies 

347
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,823
and they're an idiot.
These people bake them cookies and they 

348
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:07,414
got to like it.

349
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,041
Oh No,
it's.

350
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,000
I mean,
it's a.

351
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,470
food is a fascinating thing to me is a.
I mean,

352
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,320
I guess this is a good time to bring it 
up as any.

353
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,101
Um,
you know,

354
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:23,101
obviously Anthony Bordain took his life 
last week and um,

355
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,380
he was a friend of mine and it was real.
That was real hard.

356
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:27,430
Friday was real hard.
Uh,

357
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:31,900
woke up and I got a text from my friend 
Maynard from tool.

358
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,580
Maynard said so much for the Keenan 
versus bordain celebrity Jujitsu match.

359
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,220
And he was like,
fuck.

360
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,570
And I was like,
oh no,

361
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:47,200
what does that mean?
And so then I googled it and I saw it.

362
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,450
I was like,
Oh shit man,

363
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,670
I can't fuck what?
Yeah,

364
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:54,640
just why he hung himself.
Like,

365
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:57,180
what?
Yeah.

366
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,400
I don't know.
Were you,

367
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,000
did you know his demons?
Was friends with them?

368
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:04,350
Hung out with him,
got fucked up with them.

369
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,930
Did you get a feeling that he had that 
in him?

370
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,340
I didn't know that,
but what was really weird,

371
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:13,890
it was like he'd been saying really 
recently that he'd never been happier.

372
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,720
He was talking about his girlfriend and 
saying that it never been happier.

373
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:21,750
Didn't know it could be that happy.
Didn't know someone could make them that

374
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:22,980
happen.
Oh man,

375
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,620
I have so terrible.
But who knows?

376
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,910
They might.
Might've been.

377
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,880
Might've broken up.
Who knows?

378
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,480
Who knows?
I don't know.

379
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,353
I don't know.
I don't.

380
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,800
I don't know.
I mean sometimes people when they say,

381
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,873
I've never been that happy,
you're catching them on these ups and 

382
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:38,701
downs.
You know,

383
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:39,720
some people,
some people,

384
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,880
you know,
people get manic,

385
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,050
right?
I don't know if he was,

386
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:45,120
but some people get,
they get up and down.

387
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,373
I'll tell you what,
he,

388
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,500
he liked to get fucked up,
you know,

389
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,920
he liked to drink.
Yeah.

390
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,270
You know,
and he enjoyed it.

391
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,010
It was,
it was something that he enjoyed.

392
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,510
But we,
um,

393
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,643
we did an episode of this show.
We went hunting for pheasants in 

394
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:06,000
Montana.
We cooked over this campfire.

395
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,210
He cooked tastic and really,
and then afterwards we drank whiskey and

396
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,140
a smoke weed and he goes deep.
He goes,

397
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:19,870
Dave,
really where I'm sitting down,

398
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:20,704
I'm like,
I'm going to just try to catch myself 

399
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,290
real.
The world spinning,

400
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,660
deep breath,
deep breath.

401
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,570
He's like,
where's the fucking weed?

402
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,670
They just kept going.
He just kept going.

403
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,320
But I knew he drank.
I didn't know he smoked weed.

404
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,293
Yeah.
Yeah.

405
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,090
He,
um,

406
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,570
he had a heroin problem when he was 
younger and he kicked it,

407
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,690
but he didn't feel the need to just be 
sober.

408
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,570
Yeah.
That was kind of interesting about him.

409
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,463
That's a,
that's a thing you would get sober from 

410
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:53,304
a drug.
They feel like they have to get sober 

411
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:55,950
from everything.
Yeah.

412
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,870
That did not feel like that.
And he,

413
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,410
by the way,
like he would drink,

414
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:05,160
but when he was home,
like with his kid and he's homeless man,

415
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,170
he didn't drink at all.
Like he would only that,

416
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,150
he would only do that when he would be 
on the road.

417
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,023
Right.
So He'd be stretches of time and he 

418
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:15,690
didn't drink at all.
And he was addicted to Jujitsu.

419
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,170
That was,
that was.

420
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:17,911
Oh really?
Yeah.

421
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:21,750
He was doing Jujitsu like literally 
every day when I was hanging around with

422
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:23,420
him,
he was um,

423
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,560
he went,
we were in Montana.

424
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:26,394
He went to Bozeman to find a local 
Jujitsu club and trained with them in 

425
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:32,770
the morning.
She just trained with everybody.

426
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,830
I never,
I hardly ever did that on the road.

427
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,060
Find a place I would just go to the gym 
and workout wouldn't.

428
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,280
But he was so into learning and getting 
better at Jujitsu.

429
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,980
Do you know if he was on prescription 
for depression or anything like that?

430
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,080
I do not.
That's what I'm so suspicious of.

431
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,900
Like when you heard of like Robin 
Williams and Chris Cornell?

432
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,793
Yeah,
there's like he was on anti anxiety 

433
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,800
medication,
anti anxiety medications,

434
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,950
a big one that stuff like it even,
you know,

435
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,320
in their,
you know,

436
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,653
in their long list of side effects.
It's always suicidal thoughts and then 

437
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,180
if you mix it with other things like 
alcohol and this,

438
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,014
and I don't know at all who was on what,
but it seems what bothers me is that 

439
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:13,364
it's not part of the conversation.
Well Robin is a different take because 

440
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:19,890
robin had lewy body disease.
Um,

441
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,200
he had a heart attack.
He had significant issues with that.

442
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,083
Um,
my friend Dr Mark Gordon actually wrote 

443
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:32,140
a paper about long term Cesia

444
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,653
like when you're under the longterm,
but like long duration for things like 

445
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,280
open heart surgery,
right?

446
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,323
That there's a high instance of 
depression afterwards and a lot of 

447
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,280
people coming of these

448
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,293
big time operations where you get 
anesthesia for long periods of time and 

449
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,690
have significant dips in their hormone 
levels afterwards.

450
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,431
It's very,
you know,

451
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:02,431
it's not like a free ride getting put 
under and having your heart opened up.

452
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:05,290
And I mean your body goes through 
massive trauma.

453
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,460
Your body body's like,
Holy Shit,

454
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,353
we just had our chest plate split open 
and your heart gets worked on or inside 

455
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:13,510
of us.
Yeah.

456
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,673
And there's a significant correlation in
Mark Gordon's opinion between 

457
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:24,050
depression,
postsurgery,

458
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,223
postsurgery depression,
and I think it's something that people 

459
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:29,180
need to look at.
He had that obviously because he,

460
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,800
he did have heart surgery for a long 
period of time.

461
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:33,634
The depression.
Lucky enough to that because I know 

462
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:35,944
people get.
I always thought it was just a mental 

463
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:38,020
thing of like,
you know,

464
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,340
surviving something.
Like I remember letterman on a show like

465
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,830
weeping and like bringing in his staff 
on and stuff.

466
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,310
I always,
I didn't know it was a hormone thing.

467
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:50,800
I was thought it was just the trauma of 
surviving that I think it can be both.

468
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,090
And I mean,
I'm sure.

469
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,840
I mean I'm obviously no doctor,
but he was,

470
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,180
I'd say you're closer to a garbage man.
But he was uh,

471
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,560
explaining it to me the,
that there is an issue with this.

472
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,370
And so robin had that and he had some 
serious neurological disorders and um,

473
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,850
and there was quite a few other things 
too,

474
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,740
right?
They're also complicated.

475
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,460
Yeah.
And then whatever medications,

476
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,550
this is the thing,
right?

477
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:23,290
Like what are these medical,
what's on,

478
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,120
you know,
you don't really don't know,

479
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,403
but I'm chester from Lincoln Park.
He was on a shitload of things and he 

480
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:34,290
was.
But he was very troubled me.

481
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,650
He was a guy that was,
he had some real problem,

482
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,140
but he was also very medicated.

483
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,101
I mean,
look,

484
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:44,101
we have the highest suicide rate among 
middle aged people in America than ever,

485
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,083
like the numbers.
The numbers are through the roof and 

486
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:51,580
there's also this pharmaceutical opioid 
crisis at the same time.

487
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,980
And I just feel like,
you know,

488
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:58,981
people are on this shit that's really 
affects your head and your mood.

489
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:00,364
And it says right in it.
Like I remember I had a friend whose 

490
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,893
brother was a depressed,
and this was the eighties when we were 

491
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,134
kids and the the game,
lack of a better word of trying to get 

492
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:15,490
the right medicine for him because when 
he,

493
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:19,660
when they prescribe the wrong one,
things got out of hand.

494
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,060
I mean like really dangerously out of 
hand,

495
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:22,894
and then they finally find the right med
for him and then he kind of groomed 

496
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,260
like,
no,

497
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,260
there's no obvious path.
The problem is it's like say if you have

498
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,030
some particular type of infection,
they give you antibiotics.

499
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:40,030
If you have poison ivy.
Yeah.

500
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,913
They,
they know what kind of cortisone cream 

501
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,830
to put on your what have you when you're
depressed.

502
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,980
Yeah.
There's

503
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,560
so many different factors involved in 
depression.

504
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:49,394
There's your actual life,
right there is what's going on in your 

505
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:56,600
life.
Like are you taking care of your body?

506
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,434
Are you exercising?
Do you have loving relationships with 

507
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:03,950
your family and close friends or do you 
feel distant and detached,

508
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:04,890
you know,
do,

509
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,723
do you not have anyone in your life like
romantically do you not have a job that 

510
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:11,600
you enjoy?
All those things factor into the way you

511
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,520
feel about life and from the time you 
were a kid.

512
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,140
Sure.
Jared whole life,

513
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,153
your whole life and then on top of that 
you have like legitimate mental illness 

514
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,083
and then you have depression because 
your brain is not producing enough 

515
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:24,404
serotonin or dopamine and there's so 
many factors and people try to self 

516
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:28,994
medicate and I know a lot of people try 
to do it with extra exercise apparently 

517
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:34,934
seems to be as effective or more 
effective than most ssri 

518
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,310
antidepressants.

519
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,530
I heard that.
I don't know if I'm right,

520
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:47,060
but I remember hearing that whatever 
your body manufacturers or secretes when

521
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:50,840
you exercise is similar to what a lot of
these drugs

522
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,321
having them.
Well,

523
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:53,730
you definitely get runner's high,
right?

524
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,350
Right.
Yeah.

525
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,730
There's high.
You actually,

526
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,760
um,
your runner's high.

527
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,090
I don't know the exact mechanisms 
involved,

528
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,640
but it has something to do with the 
cannabinoid receptors,

529
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,533
so it literally gives you a high.
That's similar to almost like a 

530
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:09,500
marijuana hot,

531
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,280
right know?
Yeah.

532
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:12,990
You get your euphoric.
Oh yeah.

533
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:14,580
You get like,
I love it.

534
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,443
Yeah.
I love running and just feel even when 

535
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,370
even if it's not identified for me as a 
high,

536
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,240
like,
like smoking weed,

537
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,020
my whole rest of my day is better.
Like there is.

538
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,330
There's a happy little thing going on 
that's,

539
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,650
you know,
not flying,

540
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,240
but I'm definitely not balled up and 
anxious the way I was before the run.

541
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,710
Yeah,
that ball up an anxious thing.

542
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:35,544
I have my own theory about that.
I think the human body has physical 

543
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:41,610
requirements and I think if you don't be
just because of the design of it,

544
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:42,444
the fact that human beings have lived 
for thousands and thousands of years 

545
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,523
either hunting or gathering or running 
away from danger or your body's like 

546
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,713
constantly inaction back then.
We essentially have the same bodies as 

547
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:57,450
people that live 10,000
years ago.

548
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,703
Our DNA is very,
very similar and I think we have all 

549
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:01,944
these requirements that we don't meet 
them and there's so many people that 

550
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,700
just sit down all day and that's all 
they do.

551
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:06,534
They walk to sit down and they sit down 
again and most of their time of sitting 

552
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,434
down,
whether they're watching television or 

553
00:26:11,341 --> 00:26:16,020
sitting in front of their computer and 
that shit is terrible for you.

554
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,010
Terrible.
Yeah.

555
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,550
And you feel it.
You just feel shitty.

556
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,770
You just,
you feel bad.

557
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,510
I was in after the,
after the Bordain News,

558
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:30,511
I was traveling outside of Chicago and 
it just kind of clicked in my head like,

559
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,773
you know,
you're just thinking whenever you have 

560
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:36,890
someone that inspires you and especially
if your friends like you were,

561
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,270
uh,
you know,

562
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,133
it's just,
you can't get it out of your head kind 

563
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:44,010
of a thing and you're balled up.
Anxiety is even worse.

564
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,070
And I just instinct instinctually got 
in,

565
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,233
put on my running shoes and just went 
for a run because I didn't want to sit 

566
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,800
and think about all of it so much and I 
just felt better like I was.

567
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,750
It wasn't euphoric again after the run,
but I was definitely better than before.

568
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,543
I feel like,
especially when you're traveling and 

569
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:06,960
stuff like that.
But he did Jujitsu all the time.

570
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,650
Cds or puzzles.
These are puzzles we can't solve.

571
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,493
Well,
yeah.

572
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,320
Who knows?
I don't know what was going on.

573
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,980
Yeah.
No,

574
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,820
and there's no way to ask him obviously.
Um,

575
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,690
yeah.
When I,

576
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,750
when I traveled,
one of the first things I do,

577
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,940
whether I'm coming home or going there,
it's workout.

578
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah.
And I didn't this weekend because Friday

579
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:33,001
when I got there I worked out Thursday,
so I'd worked out that day already.

580
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:36,100
I ran that day and then I got there 
Thursday night,

581
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,800
woke up Friday to that text and I was 
just like,

582
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:41,290
fuck man,
I didn't want to do anything.

583
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,780
I cried.
Yeah.

584
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,123
I felt like shit.
Got a bunch of phone calls from some 

585
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,700
friends and then I had two shows that 
night and I was like,

586
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,990
I just got a,
just got to get on the horse her up.

587
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,103
And it was a little worried.
I was a little worried that I was going 

588
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:56,830
to be like moody or weirded out.
Yeah.

589
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,843
But once I got there I was fine.
The emails with the San Tino and Tony 

590
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,620
Hinchcliffe.
Nice.

591
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,560
So those two guys are great.
Just had a fun time.

592
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:09,230
We talked a little bit about it and 
smoked a little weed.

593
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,240
Nice.
Got Up there and just had some fun

594
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,143
and the energy of the crowd.
I saw your instagram of the crowd and 

595
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,970
this beautiful theater.
That's an amazing theater.

596
00:28:15,971 --> 00:28:16,804
You can't have it.
It'd be tough to be depressed and do it 

597
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,350
with all those fans in that 100 people.
Yeah.

598
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,070
Yeah.
We did two shows.

599
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:24,970
Two,
they were both great.

600
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,430
Oh,
they looked killer font.

601
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,500
Awesome town man.
Great food people.

602
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,950
It's a combination of in the big city 
and like Midwest,

603
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:34,300
like friendly people.
Yeah.

604
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,143
Yeah.
And the summer becomes a totally 

605
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,510
different city too.
I was old.

606
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,423
I'd always gone my whole career in the 
winter and then literally just like 

607
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:44,350
three years ago,
went in the summer and I was like,

608
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,290
Oh man,
this place is amazing.

609
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:49,320
The parks and the festivals and it's 
great.

610
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,380
Even in the winter,
the winter's gigs there

611
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,310
in December and January I,
yeah,

612
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,620
it's like they're happy to be inside.

613
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,893
Exactly.
And that you came through the cold to 

614
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:02,134
see them.
Yeah.

615
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,633
But the,
but,

616
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,650
but back to the food thing.
Uh,

617
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,450
I mean the stories that Bordain told 
through food,

618
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,550
whereas just,
I mean,

619
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,770
amazing.
That's why he reached so many people.

620
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:15,604
You could sit with that show and he 
really took his time and you've really 

621
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:21,850
felt like you were,
you had been there.

622
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,670
Well after he,
after he left us an episode.

623
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,040
Yeah.
He made me think of food as an art form.

624
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,410
Yeah.
I never thought of as an art form before

625
00:29:30,411 --> 00:29:33,410
watching no reservations,
his original show.

626
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I've watched that show and I just 
wouldn't feel like,

627
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,590
oh,
this is not what thought it was.

628
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:41,980
I thought it was

629
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,491
just like,
oh,

630
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,770
this guy knows how to cook yummy food.
That's great.

631
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,890
But then then watching his show I was 
like,

632
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,090
oh,
this is art.

633
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,983
Like these guys are treating this like a
painting or sculpture or something like 

634
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:53,794
that.
And then they're passionate and they're 

635
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:59,170
all tattooed up and Weirdos that they're
artists.

636
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,550
They're just artists that cook.
That's right.

637
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,160
It might as well be making music or 
painting,

638
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,560
whatever it would be,
drawing their artists

639
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,960
at its best.
Yeah.

640
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,630
You know,
in the same thing with like within any,

641
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,563
any other art form.
Then there's people that just crank it 

642
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:17,220
out and see a way to make money and you 
can tell there's a difference,

643
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:22,221
but once you stuff from an artist,
you're spoiled because then you're like,

644
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,660
oh,
these people don't care as much.

645
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,410
This is technically,
this is Lasagna,

646
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:31,260
but ah,
the same.

647
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,680
I know.
It's fascinating.

648
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,240
It's,
it's,

649
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,710
it's interesting.
The approach is very,

650
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,690
um,
it's very contagious.

651
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,763
Yeah.
You watched the way they cook and you 

652
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,030
watch like their,
their passion for the food.

653
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:46,060
It makes you hungry.
You want to eat and you also want to try

654
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:46,601
it.
Yes,

655
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:47,330
I do.
Yeah.

656
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,150
I always want to try it.

657
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,530
Always,
always.

658
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,170
It's fascinating.
Like,

659
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,763
you know,
going around and meeting all of these 

660
00:30:55,531 --> 00:30:56,364
bakers.
It's like they all got into it because 

661
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:00,990
there's a love there and then it's 
really hard work.

662
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,730
Like these people work there,
you know,

663
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,780
2:00
in the morning,

664
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:05,670
they're baking,
they're like in there,

665
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,580
like,
I know it sounds so silly,

666
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,653
but anytime I'd walk into a coffee shop 
or a bakery or something and just see 

667
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:13,554
that whole,
like a whole display case filled with 

668
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:19,650
stuff seems like it's always been there 
and you don't now meeting the people,

669
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,040
these poor bastards who are making it 
every day at 2:00

670
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,870
in the morning.
It's hard,

671
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:25,704
hard work and the only way it seems that
they can continue to do it is because 

672
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:33,810
there was that initial love of it.
The deep,

673
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:34,644
deep love.
They learned it from their grandparents 

674
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:36,744
or they just went to school and figured 
it out and they just hooked them and 

675
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,064
that like,
it's enough of a big bang explosion of 

676
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:48,100
love that they stay in it for like 10 
years and make a business out of it.

677
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,100
My grandfather used to walk to get bread
every day.

678
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,460
We would,
uh,

679
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,750
he lived on North Ninth Street in North 
New Jersey.

680
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,860
Oh yeah.
And uh,

681
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,620
which was at one point in time and 
Italian community,

682
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,930
right.
It wasn't when he lived there,

683
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:03,780
when he died,
but,

684
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,390
but when I was a boy,
we would go,

685
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,460
um,
we would leave his house,

686
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,050
wound visit,
stay there,

687
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,650
we'd leave his house,
we'd walk like three or four blocks down

688
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:18,820
the street to this bakery that he had 
been going to for probably 30 years.

689
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,410
And these people,
this was like an old town in bakery.

690
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:28,630
Those white paper bags put the loaves in
and you go there.

691
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:31,610
They would go there every day and get 
Italian bread every day,

692
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,520
every day,
get fresh bread.

693
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,210
And the bread was good for about a day 
or two.

694
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,980
Like if you got the second day I was a 
little dry and

695
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,083
stale,
but if you got it that day boy sliced 

696
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,950
the bread and you know,
my grandmother made a homemade pasta she

697
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:51,080
made from scratch,
from,

698
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,380
from flour and eggs,
add the whole thing,

699
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:56,440
make Lasagna,
make these.

700
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,480
And it was just fucking sensational.
It's the best.

701
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,343
He's the best.

702
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,383
And you know,
there's the thing like when someone 

703
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,390
makes something really good in the 
community,

704
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:09,820
it changes the community because people 
will walk to get it in the morning,

705
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,110
just making something real quality.
All of a sudden it's like,

706
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,780
it just starts attracting people.
It's fascinating.

707
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:19,060
It is fascinating.
Did your parents,

708
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,300
your grandparents come over from Italy?
They were born there.

709
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,100
Oh yeah.
What part,

710
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,450
mom?
Well,

711
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:29,530
different parts,
but cecily and Naples.

712
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,000
Mine says and Naples.
Yeah.

713
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,590
That's funny.
Yeah.

714
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,300
So is Rogan,

715
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,970
which that's Irish.
That's my grandfather came from Ireland.

716
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,080
My grandfather on my father's side came 
from Ireland.

717
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:44,720
My grandmother on my father's side came 
from Italy.

718
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,490
So one quarter,
one quarter.

719
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:46,950
Irish.

720
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,783
It's funny,
we were one quarter German all the rest 

721
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:53,220
of Italian and it's amazing.
So did they speak Italian?

722
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,261
Yeah,
yeah.

723
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:56,210
They spoke dialect to.
Oh yeah,

724
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,153
you would.
You'd know what the fuck they were 

725
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:00,080
saying.
Even if you spoke Italian,

726
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:00,914
like if you spoke proper Italian and 
listen to my grandmother and my 

727
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:03,524
grandfather yell at each other,
the other know what the fuck they were 

728
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,990
saying that each other is so much to so 
credit.

729
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:09,681
They really,
yeah,

730
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,300
it was when I was a little kid,
I'd go over the house,

731
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,770
I'd have to hide.
They would start yelling.

732
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,960
My grandmother was late for everything.
Everything she ever did,

733
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:20,360
she was laid for and my grandfather's 
name,

734
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,000
my,
my family was very unoriginal.

735
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,240
My father's name was Joseph.
My grandfather's name is Joseph.

736
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,110
My Grandmother's name is Joseph.
My name is Joseph,

737
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,430
so it's like a lot of fucking jokes.
But you call your grandmother grandma,

738
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,690
grandma,
grandma.

739
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,703
But when,
uh,

740
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,543
when I was over there,
I remember my grandmother was always 

741
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:44,390
yelling at my grandfather's whether we 
got to leave,

742
00:34:44,391 --> 00:34:49,391
we got to leave and she would get crazy.

743
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,773
It would fucking get crazy.
I was always scared of marriage because 

744
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,713
it was part of the reason why I was 
scared of my grandparents were always 

745
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:59,780
yelling at each other.
I was wanting to get the fuck away,

746
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:00,614
man.
I was just how they communicated back 

747
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:03,770
then though.
I remember my,

748
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,480
my grandparents too,
like,

749
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,343
just shy,
like,

750
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,493
like,
like,

751
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,510
like veins popping out.
Well,

752
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,790
they,
they grew up in the hard times,

753
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:17,690
man,
when my grandmother had a stroke and um,

754
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,553
when they were taking care of her,
they started finding these little 

755
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:25,310
pockets of money that she had squirreled
away in the house right over the house,

756
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:28,270
like coffee cans,
passionate,

757
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,830
because during the depression,
yeah,

758
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,480
people just,
they,

759
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,370
they realize like,
oh my God,

760
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,560
it can get to a point where there's no 
food,

761
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,040
like nothing,
nothing

762
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,940
and people starved to death.
That's really possible.

763
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,043
It was the reality in the United States 
going through that was far better than 

764
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,880
like say Europe post World War II or the
Soviet Union where you know,

765
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,290
it was worse there.
Oh fuck man.

766
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,300
People Starve to death.
Who knows?

767
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:58,134
Untold,
how many people starve to death in the 

768
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,190
Soviet Union,
starve to death.

769
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:03,024
I know that sounds selfish,
but I only thought of it in terms of 

770
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:06,480
America.
Of course the whole time.

771
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,363
Oh,
of course.

772
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,370
Well,
you,

773
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,890
Russia,
Russia took it really bad.

774
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,780
Russia to World War Two.
Very,

775
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:13,614
very bad.
And these people that grew up during 

776
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:19,270
that era.
When my grandparents came here,

777
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:20,104
my grandfather came here.
I think when he was seven and it was 

778
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,780
during the depression,
so it was like the worst.

779
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,840
Yeah,
of the early thirties and you know,

780
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,280
my grandmother was similar age.
They just had this,

781
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,580
this mentality like it could all go 
away.

782
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,503
They had a,
they had seen it yet it was burned into 

783
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:38,080
them and you know,
kids today,

784
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:41,080
everyone's like fucking leaving food on 
their plate.

785
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,303
No one's worrying about where it's 
coming from and everybody thinks they 

786
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:48,460
had a totally different mentality.
They were scared big time.

787
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:48,950
Yeah.

788
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:49,783
I mean they had,
they had nothing and they would save 

789
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,880
everything.
Every little piece,

790
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:54,590
every little something like,
well,

791
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,460
tin foil and think about how messed up 
it is that they go from that.

792
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,563
They go from the depression,
they get out of it and then you roll 

793
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:04,010
into World War II,
like these people,

794
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,293
they dealt with a lot of different 
levels of stuff that we didn't have to 

795
00:37:09,171 --> 00:37:10,004
deal with.

796
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,410
Yeah.
I mean,

797
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,680
Tim Kennedy,
who was a guest of mine recently,

798
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,500
a friend of mine said something very 
profound.

799
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,230
He said,
hard times make tough men.

800
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,290
Easy Times make weak men.
Yeah,

801
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,150
but hard men make easy times.
Nice.

802
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,540
You think about it that way.
Yeah.

803
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,230
Hard,
hard times.

804
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,400
Make tough men.
Tough men make easy times.

805
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,830
Easy Times.
Make weak men.

806
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,023
Yeah.
It's like a fucking growth cycle when 

807
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,310
people are always like,
kids today,

808
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,550
kids today don't know.
Well,

809
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,620
it's because they haven't gone.

810
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,390
No you can't.
You can't manufacture that for them.

811
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,610
My Grandmother,
this is a funny story.

812
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm on nine slash 11.
I was a in New York.

813
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:58,610
It was at Newark.
You don't hear that a lot.

814
00:37:58,611 --> 00:37:59,720
By the way.
This is a funny story.

815
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,780
Nine slash 11,
but I was at Newark.

816
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:07,781
I was flying out that day and we watched
the second plane fly into the.

817
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,713
You saw it.
So the second one I saw it saw it on 

818
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:11,930
television.
No.

819
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,910
You know what Newark,
you look right across it.

820
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,570
You were looking at you actually 
literally across a 100 percent.

821
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,570
I was the first planet hulk was going 
through your mind when you saw it hit.

822
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,543
Well,
the first one hit on before we got 

823
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:25,154
there,
before I got there and I walked with a 

824
00:38:26,061 --> 00:38:30,140
pilot down,
like through the airport and he said,

825
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,040
hey,
I think it was assessing,

826
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:31,730
uh,
you know,

827
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,563
just kinda crazy.

828
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,540
And um,
so I'm down there and I,

829
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,633
I was at the,
at the desk and I said I was going to 

830
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,700
Chicago and I said to the woman working 
the thing,

831
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:43,534
I said,
do you think we're going to fly out 

832
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,370
today?
You know,

833
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,980
do you think we're going to actually get
out?

834
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,070
And a guy yells,
here comes another one,

835
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,720
this man,
just like a businessman.

836
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,080
And we all turned and you could just see
it streaking across right into the small

837
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,360
plane.
Look small but just so insane.

838
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,660
So I sit down,
I just sat,

839
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,370
we just.
And I was sitting with an artist,

840
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,443
a middle aged man who was an artist and 
then we heard about the Pentagon as we 

841
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:17,140
were sitting there.
And he opened up his little art case and

842
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:17,974
it had all these razors in it,
like razor blades and stuff from his 

843
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:21,400
artwork.

844
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,090
Like,
you know,

845
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,350
he's a commercial artist and he's like,
this is all going to change.

846
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:26,184
He said,
you know,

847
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,153
people are just,
they let me on the plane with this and 

848
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,020
we're just sitting there like,
just freaked out,

849
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:36,430
like calm but freaked out.
And I was calling my wife who was in New

850
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:41,260
York and woke her up and we were trying 
to talk and she was going to the thing.

851
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,543
And uh,
at one point that the artist I was 

852
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:46,060
sitting with just looked at me like in 
my eyes,

853
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:48,460
like we're trying to understand what was
happening.

854
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:50,290
He said,
I think we should go home now.

855
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,840
I was lucky.
Yeah,

856
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,980
yeah,
right.

857
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,873
Of course we should after sitting there 
for 20 minutes so I can't get back into 

858
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:00,580
New York.
I can't get back into the city.

859
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:01,414
Time's gone by and I'm in a cab going up
the parkway in New Jersey and there's 

860
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,820
just dust where the towers were.

861
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,800
And I'm like,
Holy Shit.

862
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:12,634
So I can't get in.
So I go to my Nana's house who lives in 

863
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,360
by giant stadium and uh,
because she's the closest to the city,

864
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:23,080
I can't get into the city.
So this a driver takes,

865
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,123
takes us over and I get to my Nana's 
house and she so excited to see me 

866
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,380
because her grandson was visiting and 
she lives alone now.

867
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:33,214
My father,
grandfather had passed and I'm sitting 

868
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,840
in front of the TV and I'm like,
Nana,

869
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,640
like I first I hugged her and I was 
like,

870
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:40,210
oh,
weepy.

871
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,370
Like I was shaking,
you know,

872
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,480
I didn't know what was happening.
And she's like,

873
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:44,314
oh,
it's so nice to see you get in here and 

874
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,050
visit.
This is so great.

875
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,140
Like you see what's happening second.
Oh,

876
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,033
I know it's a crazy world.
And I sit in their little tiny living 

877
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:55,984
room den area and we have the TV on and 
she's trying to talk to me and I'm 

878
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,480
trying to watch the television.

879
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,690
And she,
this is the world war mentality.

880
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,013
Uh,
I am again and I'm kind of avoiding 

881
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:10,300
talking to her.
And she goes,

882
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:10,931
all right,
well look,

883
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:14,410
I have a bridge game or a card game with
my lady friends here.

884
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,550
Take half of my sandwich.
She reached it,

885
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,393
opened the tin foil,
gave me half of a tuna fish sandwich 

886
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,290
goes,
you eat this,

887
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:22,570
I'm going to go play cards with my 
friends and we'll have dinner after.

888
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:25,330
You'll be okay.
And she walks out.

889
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,010
Wow.
But they were tough.

890
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:30,340
They dealt with so much.
I hadn't dealt with anything.

891
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,160
I'm freaking out.
Not freaking out.

892
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:33,530
She's like,
it's a crazy world.

893
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,490
She wasn't like,
you know,

894
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,930
Alzheimer's.
She was just,

895
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,130
hey,
you know,

896
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,910
we lost a couple of buildings and a few 
thousand people.

897
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,160
Here's half a sandwich.
I'm going to go play bridge.

898
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:47,570
I'm going to play bridge.
We got to keep moving.

899
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,090
Tomorrow's another day.
But that's how they live.

900
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,480
Both my grandmothers were that way.
Just completely like plow ahead.

901
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,463
Go ahead,
don't get caught up thinking about 

902
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,550
everything that's happening because 
there's no sense in it.

903
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:00,890
We've done that before and you get 
nowhere.

904
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,600
So let's just keep going this way.
Well,

905
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,310
having a war that affected people the 
way World War Two did,

906
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:13,640
where the entire need,
not just the entire nation was involved,

907
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:16,910
but the whole world was involved in this
conflict to stop evil.

908
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,530
Yeah.
It was a different time.

909
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,900
You had an evildoer yeah,
you had a real.

910
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:24,080
I mean,
obviously Isis is evil.

911
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:28,580
Obviously North Korea,
there's a lot of evil in the world.

912
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,703
It's not like this evil empire that's 
invading Europe and dropping bombs on 

913
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:35,460
people.
It's not the same.

914
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,313
It's not no Nazis that believe in 
eugenics and want to create an area in 

915
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:43,660
race and like that was handling camps 
and not stopping,

916
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,160
spreading,
telling people were coming and they were

917
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:49,690
the most sophisticated in terms of 
engineering and like,

918
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,130
I mean they,
they to this day,

919
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,993
I mean,
where do you get all the fucking 

920
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,780
engineers in terms of,
uh,

921
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,070
like automobiles,
top end,

922
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,710
Audi,
BMW,

923
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,040
those people were making shit for Nazis 
back then.

924
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,903
Yeah.
I mean that's another co opted by the 

925
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:07,034
regime.
Do you ever see like one of Hitler's 

926
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:12,350
cars,
there's a Audi from like 1930,

927
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:15,950
something was made for Hitler.
Yeah.

928
00:43:15,951 --> 00:43:19,190
It's like they,
they were designing engines,

929
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,770
planes,
and they were super,

930
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:25,640
super advanced or super advanced now,
and you have this real,

931
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,400
you have this real evil focus.

932
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,270
Like it was like,
okay,

933
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,850
the world has got to come and go get 
this one guy.

934
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:33,170
It seemed,
I don't know.

935
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,500
I mean I wasn't there but it seems more 
black and white and the way the world is

936
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,363
for sure.
I mean there was a thing called 

937
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,493
operation paperclip that happened where 
after the war we scooped up all these 

938
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:48,460
Nazi scientists secretly and some of 
them were like legit,

939
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,530
like Wernher von Braun,
the guy who was in charge of NASA,

940
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,220
he was a Nazi rally,
a hundred percent.

941
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,190
The Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if
he was alive today,

942
00:43:58,191 --> 00:43:59,024
they would prosecute him for crimes 
against humanity and he was the head of 

943
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:04,220
NASA who's the head of NASA.
She,

944
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,203
they took monsters when they brought 
those monsters over here and those 

945
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:11,870
monsters helped us make the Apollo 
rockets.

946
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,780
She.
Yeah.

947
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,350
And then some of the monsters went to 
the Soviet Union.

948
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,010
They took some of those monsters can 
hills where I mean,

949
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,570
and there's no reason to whitewash that 
either.

950
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,403
Those were real monsters were real,
like they hung the five slow as Jews 

951
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:24,884
everyday in front of the,
of the rocket factory in Berlin where 

952
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,210
Wernher von Braun was making rockets 
for,

953
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,980
for the Nazis.
Oh my God.

954
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,873
Yeah.
They had these Jews that were slaves 

955
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:35,280
that worked as well.
I mean,

956
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:36,114
there's people that were alive today 
that have those tattoos on their arms 

957
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,523
at,
talked about meeting him there and she 

958
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,960
hit me and they,
they would hang the slowest workers.

959
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,220
Oh my God.
Yeah.

960
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,130
In the front of the factory and just 
getting this keeps going to work.

961
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,300
It doesn't leave the country.
What did you do?

962
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,370
And then get out in Nazi Germany.
Yay.

963
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,150
You know,
how the fuck could you get out?

964
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,830
You were a slave.
No,

965
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:03,370
not the chooser.
Baron,

966
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,790
the guys who were working on were 
working for the,

967
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:06,950
uh,
for the company.

968
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,420
Like to see the people being hung and 
still hang in there.

969
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,410
They were Nazis.
I mean,

970
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,660
he was,
they were all in.

971
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,613
Yeah.
I mean,

972
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,543
whether or not he agreed with the 
ideology wholeheartedly mean I didn't 

973
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:18,654
have a conversation with them.
I don't know if he was doing for 

974
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:23,090
pragmatic purposes because he was 
frightened or whatever,

975
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,260
but get a disguise,
get out of there.

976
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,410
I don't think they could,
you know,

977
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,880
one of those glasses with the mustaches 
is that work?

978
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,040
Go to the airport.
He can come to you.

979
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,360
Take it off like,
oh,

980
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:37,740
it's like a NASA guy.
Well,

981
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:40,200
this is like a suburb.
There was a slow slide,

982
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:42,390
I'm sure into that.
I mean the,

983
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,040
the,
the,

984
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,873
the slot wasn't that slow.
But from World War One and world war 

985
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,660
two,
as it escalated,

986
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,740
I think it just got to this point where 
they're like,

987
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:54,120
oh my God,
like what are we doing?

988
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:54,954
When they started having concentration 
camps and killing all the Jews got 

989
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,570
terrifying and those.

990
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,240
So he took a lot of.
Those guys brought them over here.

991
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,880
They worked for,
worked for the US government man.

992
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:06,714
Oh Man.
I have a [inaudible] 67 Volkswagen 

993
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,400
little beetle sweet little car.
Sweet little car.

994
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,263
It was a little 10 pounds now,
but it's solid and yet you can't get 

995
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:19,020
around like every time we meant it,
you think,

996
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,820
you know,
this was the people's car.

997
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:24,320
This was the,
this was the early Nazi Germany.

998
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,660
Hitler on the,
uh,

999
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,480
at the,
at the plants,

1000
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:28,314
you know,
being very proud of at this car and 

1001
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:30,060
stuff.
Well,

1002
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,940
here's a good way of looking at it too.
You have a 67,

1003
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:33,660
right?
Yeah.

1004
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,790
That's like,
if I had a 19,

1005
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:40,791
98 car that was produced by Nazis,
what do you mean in 98?

1006
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:46,490
Because it's 20 years old.
Twenty years from 67 to like literally.

1007
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:49,104
Yeah,
it,

1008
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,120
it's that era.
Yeah.

1009
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,740
I mean it's so close.

1010
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,420
So close.
Twenty years.

1011
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:55,560
Yeah.
That's nothing.

1012
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,300
That's nothing.
God.

1013
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:00,600
Yeah.
Think about it that way.

1014
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:01,434
There is that,
that car is 20 slash 20 years removed 

1015
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:06,480
from Hitler being empowered.
Did you literally.

1016
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:11,540
Did you do that randomly?
Google that because that's my car.

1017
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,900
My car is literally,
as you're actually adding back color,

1018
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,670
different wheels,
different hubcaps now,

1019
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:21,000
but I mean the activity.
My friend Jimmy Lawless had one of those

1020
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:24,330
when were in high school.
It was so light.

1021
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,393
It was crazy.
So he had a tiny ass little engine in 

1022
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:29,290
the back.
It's got a little four cylinder.

1023
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,930
That's a big.
When you see this little beetle,

1024
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:33,650
you don't think Nazis,
you think,

1025
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,170
think it's cute or adorable.
Have you seen what they do?

1026
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:41,110
They take an older nine slash 11 inch 
and put them in these things.

1027
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,530
Make them fast.
I know they do that with the buses too,

1028
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,750
but you look how little those fucking 
tires are.

1029
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,270
I know that thing ain't got any 
traction.

1030
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,490
No going around turns with that thing.
It's like,

1031
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:54,880
Hey,
they were smart back then though.

1032
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,850
Their engineering with.
They put the weight of the engine in the

1033
00:47:57,851 --> 00:47:58,780
back.
Yeah,

1034
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:01,060
and it has such a different effect 
there.

1035
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:06,100
It's kind of amazing to look at all 
automobile manufacturing in the thirties

1036
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,740
before the war come like there was 
enough metal for everybody.

1037
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:11,520
There was enough ingenuity.
The French card,

1038
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:16,510
all the design is so amazing.
There was a real moment of,

1039
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:17,823
of uh,
inspiration and creativity and then the 

1040
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:21,214
war came into this,
like all the resources and all the 

1041
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:25,180
people and everything got dampened down.
But man,

1042
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:26,014
they were flying in the thirties.
What's interesting though is there was 

1043
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:32,190
another resurgence in the sixties,
like,

1044
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,033
especially in America.
American cars in the sixties were 

1045
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:39,160
fucking amazing.
And then the gas crisis got them right.

1046
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,630
The Seventies.
They dog shit.

1047
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,980
Yeah.
Were terrible.

1048
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,290
So bad.
So useless.

1049
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:48,280
Oh my mom had a pinto.
It was a bad car.

1050
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,110
But like I'm a muscle car fan.
Right.

1051
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,400
Like for me the golden era was like 19 
sixties to somewhere around 71.

1052
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,203
But the last of the great cars,
like 71 Barracuda's still pretty bad 

1053
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,293
ass.
But then 72 starts to look a little 

1054
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:05,980
shitty seven mustangs.
Yeah.

1055
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:10,750
Once you get to 75 their dog shit.
But by the time 1980 rolls around,

1056
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:13,660
just fucking like those things on fire 
because of the gas.

1057
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,700
Well,
the gas crisis came,

1058
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,060
they started making cars cheaper and 
they were just lighter.

1059
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:19,933
They try to make them more fuel 
efficient and something happened to the 

1060
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:27,370
way they look like shit.
Yeah,

1061
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,980
look at that.
That's a 79 Mustang.

1062
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,760
So it's terrible.
Now I want you to.

1063
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,500
So this is a 1979.

1064
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:40,620
This piece of shit.
Now I want you to Google 1969.

1065
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:44,860
Mach one.
Get ready for this motherfucker.

1066
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,320
Nineteen 69.
Mach one.

1067
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,170
Boom son.
Click on that black one right there.

1068
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,260
Click on that.
Come the fuck on.

1069
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,060
Do you go from.
How do you go from that?

1070
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:01,390
And 10 years later you have that box a 
piece of shit.

1071
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,733
Look at that red one.
The upper right hand corner and that 

1072
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:04,863
looks like it should come with Steve 
Mcqueen and good glibly Mowgli at that 

1073
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:10,650
thing.
What a fucking car that his.

1074
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,530
God.
Damn.

1075
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,680
That doesn't get your dick hard.
Doctor comes a steve McQueen and a naked

1076
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,200
gal in the back.
Steve McQueen at a 68.

1077
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,110
Go with a 19 gold.
Nineteen 68.

1078
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:26,410
Steve Mcqueen mustangs.
The green one.

1079
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,030
Yeah,
it

1080
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:28,990
is.
Boom.

1081
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,810
Look at that.
Come on man.

1082
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,580
What did they do?
Fuck,

1083
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:36,800
that's more than the gas.
That's some bad.

1084
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,710
Something happened in the company.
Something happened with life.

1085
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,300
Yeah.
Something happened in Ford.

1086
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,520
Look how gorgeous that is.
Cad.

1087
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,480
I mean that is a fucking work of art 
that there's the.

1088
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,990
The lines on that thing.
Seventy six Toyota Corolla.

1089
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,423
One 1976.
I want to show you what a bad ass 

1090
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:59,840
vehicle I was driving around.
Yeah,

1091
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,710
that yellow baby.
But yeah,

1092
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:05,900
mine was baby shit orange.
Here's the thing.

1093
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,900
That thing would start up every day.
Yes.

1094
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,580
One hundred percent.
That's the difference.

1095
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,310
It might look like a piece of shit and 
it most certainly does.

1096
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,720
That was it.
That was the color baby.

1097
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:19,721
Shit orange and I put a racing stripe 
along the side and I had a horn in it.

1098
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:23,450
The plate,
200 different tunes.

1099
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,240
Really?
Like dukes of hazzard or happy birthday.

1100
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,310
I had everything.
I had a CB in it.

1101
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,760
Why?
I contact my friends on my CB.

1102
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,770
You had a CB regarding to the dairy 
queen.

1103
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:40,940
Cover your friends at CBS two or just 
getting out into the abyss?

1104
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:47,190
We had like three friends with cvs 
because he had no regard for a party.

1105
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:49,970
I'm not sure we're going to pick dairy 
queen.

1106
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,163
Okay.
Grab me here.

1107
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,960
Roberta finger blizzard in a minute.
Explain that to me.

1108
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:55,670
How do you choose what channel you're 
on?

1109
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,370
A you just choose.
We just all were.

1110
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,080
We all knew we were on channel,
you know,

1111
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,060
for whatever.
How many channels are there?

1112
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,150
Not that many actually.
So how close do you have to be?

1113
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,640
Um,
like 10 miles.

1114
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,560
Within 10 miles.
You could use it.

1115
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:10,394
Yeah.
Weed.

1116
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,893
And that's all.
That's all you're doing is back then we 

1117
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,840
weren't thinking I had a Toyota Corolla 
with a horn that play 200 songs.

1118
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:22,130
I was inhaling curve ahead of the curve.
It was having a blast.

1119
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:24,680
I was so happy to be out of the house.
But isn't that amazing?

1120
00:52:24,681 --> 00:52:25,514
Like I'm thinking about this now,
how often people use cell phones and 

1121
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:33,380
such.
What are people thinking back then?

1122
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:35,480
Like why didn't they get CBS on their 
car?

1123
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,010
I don't know.
It's a good question.

1124
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,110
Why wouldn't everybody have one?
I don't know.

1125
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:41,180
And it especially then it was like the 
big trucking era.

1126
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:45,040
It was a convoy dude.
It was a big convoy.

1127
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:47,150
Yes.
Smokey and the bandit had it come on.

1128
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,523
Come on.
Smokey and the bandit had it in his 

1129
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,830
trans am.
Yeah,

1130
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:52,400
that's right.
They were talking to each other.

1131
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,730
What year was that?
I think he was.

1132
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,020
He had a [inaudible] 79 trans am.
Yeah.

1133
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:01,520
I was going to put it at seventy eight 
cents at a CBS exploded in the seventies

1134
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:06,521
when the oil crisis caused the miles per
hour on the highway to go down at 55 and

1135
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:09,890
truckers started using them until each 
other where the best gas prices were.

1136
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:15,050
A network started with people using CBS 
rubber duck.

1137
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:15,913
That's funny because I would have 
thought that they were excluded because 

1138
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:20,270
they were using them to tell each other 
where the cops were.

1139
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,250
Yeah.
Like smokey and the bandit.

1140
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:22,731
Yeah.
Dude,

1141
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:26,250
when I was in high school,
it was 55 miles per hour is the speed

1142
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,170
limit,
which is just fucking torture.

1143
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,350
It's torture.
We need doing,

1144
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:30,840
uh,
people.

1145
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,240
Who Do you think you are telling people 
to go?

1146
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:35,640
Fifty five miles on the highway,
the highway,

1147
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:39,570
and with a 400 horsepower engine that 
Steve Mcqueen Cook.

1148
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:43,260
What the fuck is that all about it?
My Toyota Corolla.

1149
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,094
It was just fast enough.
We've Sanjenis speed traps was like the 

1150
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:48,620
third thing listed.
Yeah,

1151
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,463
I would imagine that would be a big one.
I mean that's what ways is pretty good 

1152
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:56,370
for that ways is like police spotted 
ahead a snitch.

1153
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,950
They blocked the freeways to in protest 
of the lower speed limits to do.

1154
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,670
I remember that.
I remember that.

1155
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,570
That.
Well.

1156
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:07,603
Idiots blocking yourself.
Stupid fucking remember when these 

1157
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,270
morons.
We're.

1158
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,183
We're blocking the highways.
You remember when people were doing 

1159
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:17,160
that?
Like San Francisco.

1160
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:19,860
That was recently.
They walk for approach protest.

1161
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:22,470
They would walk out,
just walk on the highway.

1162
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,560
What the fuck was that about?
God,

1163
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:28,290
people have stopped doing that.
You want everyone to hate you?

1164
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,550
Well,
it's not just that.

1165
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,790
It's like you're stopping people from 
being able to get to a hospital.

1166
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,180
You might cause people loved ones' lives
and they did.

1167
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,010
Well.
That's what happened with the governor.

1168
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:39,660
Christie,
when he closed down the bridge,

1169
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,730
he has a couple of people died because 
of that,

1170
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,920
because they couldn't get to the 
hospital.

1171
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:47,310
They were.
He not in jail for that guys.

1172
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:50,850
The worst housing non jail.
You should totally be in jail.

1173
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,833
Other people went to jail for it.
That is just fucking straight 

1174
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:55,980
corruption.
Just to,

1175
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:00,350
to make that call.
The audacity that you'd have to have the

1176
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,010
balls to make that fucking call and say,
shut.

1177
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,610
Yo.
That guy was so some m and m's.

1178
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:06,503
So arrogant.
Do you remember seeing when he with a 

1179
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,533
closed the beaches and he,
him and his family were the only one on 

1180
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:12,210
the beach.

1181
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,043
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1182
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,270
yeah.
Dispatch says everything.

1183
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:19,480
Just his body says everything.
Let yourself get to that state slob.

1184
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:21,510
And he had an operation to.
Oh,

1185
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,800
he had a stomach stapling.
Did he really them through it.

1186
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,110
Look at that fucking every beach was 
called.

1187
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,330
Every state beach was closed I think on 
the fourth of July.

1188
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,810
And Hammond is fat family.
We're just sitting there on the beach.

1189
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:37,750
Just what an f you to everybody look at 
that is extreme.

1190
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,180
Nobody else allowed extreme arrogance.
And why would the beaches closed down?

1191
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,250
Uh,
for the budget?

1192
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:45,084
He,
he ordered him closed because they 

1193
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:49,470
couldn't pay for people to watch the 
beaches.

1194
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,410
It was like one of those pissing matches
between,

1195
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:53,244
you know,
who's gonna cut what for the budget for 

1196
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,540
July sand portrait of him.
Look at that.

1197
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,130
Someone made fun of him in the sand.

1198
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,310
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

1199
00:56:02,311 --> 00:56:03,144
The fourth of July,
looking at him in his little shower 

1200
00:56:04,471 --> 00:56:08,910
sandals.
So I think the kids call those slides.

1201
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,360
They call them slides,
you know the kids call those slides.

1202
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:12,960
Slides.
I call them flip flops.

1203
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,231
No,
no,

1204
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:14,064
no,
no.

1205
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,700
When I see someone in the airport with 
slides on,

1206
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:18,720
I,
we just want to punch him.

1207
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,660
It's a lot of dudes have slides in the 
airport with socks on.

1208
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:22,830
A Mike.
Okay.

1209
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,890
What are you doing here?
Why is that annoy me?

1210
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,440
Because it's lazy.
You don't like lazy.

1211
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,070
It's lazy.
Yeah,

1212
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,880
but I have those Solomon running shoes 
that don't even have.

1213
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,223
They don't have laces.
They have like this little tab you pull 

1214
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:42,130
and you pull it down and it tightens up 
and you open it up and it's like velcro.

1215
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,750
Yeah,
but you're still pulling a tab.

1216
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:48,790
At least there's a little something,
just stick them in your feet and flop,

1217
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:51,400
flop flop like that.

1218
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,010
White people don't like that because 
they're lazy.

1219
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,520
As comfortable as possible.
Very,

1220
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,370
very excited about this.
It makes me so angry,

1221
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:04,930
but why?
Because you're a 25 year old man sitting

1222
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:08,140
on the floor of an airport waiting for 
your thing next year.

1223
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,590
Shower sandals.
A lot of people do it though.

1224
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,663
It's not a lot of people do it,
but enough people do it with the socks 

1225
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:20,440
and the slide bothers bothers me so 
much.

1226
00:57:20,441 --> 00:57:21,970
I don't know.
Why does it bother you?

1227
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:25,570
More or less than flip flops?
I'm a little bit more,

1228
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:29,590
which is pretty crazy because I really 
railed against people with flip flops.

1229
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:31,500
Like Bert Kreischer wears flip flops 
everywhere.

1230
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,950
Disgusting.
These kind of gross.

1231
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,813
It's so gross and people act like their 
feet on your feet have a real bacteria 

1232
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,330
between the toes.
There's like a real,

1233
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,400
a real germs in there and then they're 
just slick.

1234
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,680
Slipping them off and putting their toes
in the magazine rack.

1235
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:50,410
But bird is like this life of the party 
type character.

1236
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:52,480
That's part of his thing.
It's his thing.

1237
00:57:52,481 --> 00:57:54,100
I love him.
I love him too.

1238
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,240
He's disgusting.
He was.

1239
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,233
There's a video of him on a fucking 
skateboard flying down his street with 

1240
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:02,860
flip flops on it.
I'm like,

1241
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:03,694
dude,
do you understand the damage to your 

1242
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:08,260
toes that you could do for the rest of 
your life?

1243
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:09,094
Your toes.
That'd be fucked up if you crash flying 

1244
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,730
down the street.
The flip flops on.

1245
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,320
He's hilarious now.
I mean,

1246
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:18,460
at least at least he's a character like 
bigger than life character.

1247
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,760
You just flip flop and you don't care 
and your pants are hanging off.

1248
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:25,570
Just to get on a flight to boise.
Just come on by Boise.

1249
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:27,520
Boise.
I love boys.

1250
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:28,660
I'm just.
What's the issue?

1251
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:31,770
Because it's a shorter flight.
I didn't want it to be like,

1252
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,670
you can't even get it together for a 
short flight.

1253
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:37,240
You know?
It's disgusting.

1254
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,220
It is weird.
It is weird.

1255
00:58:39,221 --> 00:58:41,850
It's just come on.
His ideas about footwear.

1256
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,650
I judge people when I see them with ease
on.

1257
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,150
Yeah.
Including Jamie.

1258
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,960
Have something right there.
No,

1259
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,940
I don't know.
You gave me some.

1260
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I don't know exactly where sat right 
here when he was like six months ago.

1261
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:57,670
Right when he gave him to me.
They were in the box right there.

1262
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,013
I've contemplated running and I'm 
running through like Korea and filming 

1263
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:03,610
it because people love these things so 
much.

1264
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,340
But uh,
I don't want to run it them.

1265
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,213
Are they expensive?
Because I like running shoes that are 

1266
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:10,240
actually supposed to be running in.
Yeah,

1267
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:11,080
they're expensive.
He's,

1268
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,300
he gets a look at him.
He's upset.

1269
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,730
Jane.
Jane is one generation younger than me.

1270
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:18,520
So his idea what these things are,
is different than my.

1271
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,260
I feel like they're mad at you for 
saying that now.

1272
00:59:21,261 --> 00:59:22,094
Some people are.
Some people think it's hilarious that 

1273
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,710
you would do that.
Would run with them.

1274
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,071
Yeah,
yeah,

1275
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:26,480
yeah.
I know another mad at me,

1276
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,793
but they're dumb.
It mad at me for what I would do with a 

1277
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,850
pair of sneakers.
You're a fucking idiot,

1278
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,130
right?
And you need to get your shit together.

1279
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,233
You're thinking about sneakers too much.
Are you happier that they just sit in 

1280
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:42,380
here and there's fucking people think 
I'm joking.

1281
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:43,423
What do they look like?
They're sitting here and this fucking 

1282
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:46,910
box.
I'm not joking.

1283
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:49,630
I mean I didn't plan this out there.
Here,

1284
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,680
this part here.
People who are into them are like,

1285
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:52,990
oh my God,
you got up there and you know,

1286
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,400
you go to them and you not even flossing
who should be out frost and man,

1287
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,370
he's taunting me.
Mock his all the time.

1288
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,800
He looked like some sneakers from the 
eighties.

1289
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,243
It's like they look like the sneaker 
version of that Shitty Mustang from 

1290
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:17,140
1979.
No Man.

1291
01:00:20,891 --> 01:00:24,730
The cool whole back end sticks out like 
this.

1292
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,740
The heel has like a duck bill behind 
you.

1293
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:31,250
It's so stupid.
It's so bizarre.

1294
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,830
Yeah.
But um,

1295
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,740
that Kanye West has a large effect on 
humans.

1296
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,070
Very interesting.
The family feud.

1297
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:41,590
They were on family feud.
Well,

1298
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,950
very good.
I have no idea.

1299
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:43,903
I just heard Howard stern talking about.
I hope they asked tough questions just 

1300
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:52,490
to see the ballpark is try try being a 
book in that house.

1301
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:59,790
You will collect dust motherfucker.
I don't care.

1302
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:03,130
It's broken up into chapters.
Read Shit.

1303
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,140
Steam reading tweets.

1304
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,320
Elon musk wants to do the podcast right 
back here on the feud.

1305
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,020
Really messaged me.
Can I come in as your,

1306
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,940
as your cohost?
Um,

1307
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:22,830
no.
I'll just listen like everybody else.

1308
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:25,380
Uh,
that's really cool.

1309
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,161
Yeah.
Should be interesting.

1310
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:26,994
Yeah.
He wants to get his mall three up to 

1311
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:33,330
some high level production and once it's
done the time away.

1312
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,330
No.
Model three Tesla model three.

1313
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:37,320
Yeah.
Close concentrating on.

1314
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,850
Yeah.
Once he's got that,

1315
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:42,690
they just delivered their first 1000 
flame throwers this weekend.

1316
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,540
Yeah.
What's up with that?

1317
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,250
Why?
Don't know.

1318
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,030
I almost bought one just to do it just 
to see what happened.

1319
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,770
Like on it's by one and you couldn't do 
it.

1320
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,960
Take it out back.
You couldn't do it as a flame thrower.

1321
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:54,660
So he named it not a flame thrower.
So what it's called?

1322
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,190
Yeah.
It's called not a flame thrower,

1323
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:58,950
so that way you can actually company not
a flame thrower.

1324
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,193
Wow.
Like some airport hangar to pick them 

1325
01:02:02,881 --> 01:02:03,714
up.
I deal with people get killed by these 

1326
01:02:06,691 --> 01:02:07,351
things.
Wait a minute,

1327
01:02:07,351 --> 01:02:10,650
there's a Mariachi band playing.
They're having a good time.

1328
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,780
Flame thrower thing.
Yeah.

1329
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:13,800
It's the big unveiling.
That's where you picked them up.

1330
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:14,671
No,
no,

1331
01:02:14,671 --> 01:02:14,941
no,
no,

1332
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:15,210
no,
no,

1333
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,280
no.
Is that real?

1334
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,020
Yeah.
Sorry.

1335
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,100
Go back up to that of the flame thrower.

1336
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,250
That's Jesus Christ.
Look at that fucking thing.

1337
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,260
Pretty cool.
Oh my God.

1338
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,153
That's amazing.
Obviously gotta buy propane maybe to 

1339
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:28,884
refill it and connect it and it's good 
because it's like it's going to cause a 

1340
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,880
housewife.
That's the purpose of that.

1341
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,010
Um,
to when you,

1342
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:38,220
when your enemies come close in,
run out of bullets.

1343
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,490
You hide behind the couch and you're in 
the movie alien.

1344
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,370
They had flame throwers.
Yeah.

1345
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,970
You need to burn them instead of shoot 
them because it's a.

1346
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,080
you're on a spaceship if you live on a 
spaceship.

1347
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,160
Oh,
right,

1348
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:50,761
right,
right.

1349
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:52,050
What are you going to do with a flame 
thrower?

1350
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,680
My boyfriend asked me.
That's her.

1351
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,783
That's the author out there blasting.
She doesn't even know the stock against 

1352
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:02,670
her fucking armpit.
She doesn't even know what she's doing.

1353
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,950
Look where she's got the stock.
Terrible technique.

1354
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,400
Tuck that into your arm,
honey.

1355
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,580
But there's not a lot of kickback.
I don't do that like a,

1356
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,563
like you're a goddamn professional.
You've exercised with trigger control 

1357
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:16,790
to.
What about his title?

1358
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,690
Discipline.
What about all those tunnels?

1359
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:19,893
Well,
how about I didn't realize how many 

1360
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:22,980
tunnels he wants to do.
He wants us.

1361
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,290
He's doing everything.
He's making flame throwers.

1362
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,573
He's making these gigawatt factories,
these gigantic batteries that are 

1363
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:31,620
powering Australia.
Yeah,

1364
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,750
I mean Nevada.
He's a very,

1365
01:03:33,751 --> 01:03:35,070
very unusual human being.

1366
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,220
It's amazing.
It's just little balls.

1367
01:03:37,221 --> 01:03:38,630
Just do it.
You gave me an idea,

1368
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:39,464
just do it.
She just not know how to handle that 

1369
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,100
gun.
Somebody told me they saw him,

1370
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:44,443
they saw him speaking and it about the 
tunnels because he's got to get 

1371
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:49,160
approval.
Like there's different things.

1372
01:03:49,161 --> 01:03:53,390
He's got to get past and he doesn't just
want a tunnel like from here to lax,

1373
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:54,403
he wants multiple tunnels,
so like if you're going to the united 

1374
01:03:56,991 --> 01:03:58,490
terminal,
it takes you right there.

1375
01:03:58,491 --> 01:03:59,324
If it goes to the American one,
it takes you there and it's going to be 

1376
01:04:01,431 --> 01:04:05,180
a whole like ant farm of tunnels all 
through the city.

1377
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,610
What happens if we get an earthquake?
What happens if there's a tsunami?

1378
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,910
Do those things fill up with water and 
is everybody drowned inside those tubes?

1379
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,710
It says the tunnels are weatherproof.

1380
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,133
Hmm.

1381
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,710
It means when it rains.
Yeah.

1382
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:18,180
That's cool.
What about an earthquake?

1383
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:19,650
I don't think earthquake is weather.

1384
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,263
MMM.

1385
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,550
Now I know.
I'm looking to see if they have any.

1386
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,220
I been getting claustrophobic lately.
Why?

1387
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,060
I don't know.
Like in what way?

1388
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:30,070
I had a couple of little instances where
I was

1389
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,800
and we never been claustrophobic before.
Nineteen 94.

1390
01:04:35,801 --> 01:04:40,210
Northridge Earthquake.
No damage to la subway tunnels in 1989.

1391
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:43,000
Loma Prieta Northern California 
earthquake.

1392
01:04:43,001 --> 01:04:45,420
No damage to tunnels.
Nineteen 85.

1393
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:48,970
Mexico City earthquake.
No damage to tunnels which are then used

1394
01:04:48,971 --> 01:04:51,130
to transport rescue personnel.

1395
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,053
The tunnels were in shape,
but there's a big rock over the hole 

1396
01:04:53,831 --> 01:04:54,910
that gets you out of the tunnel.

1397
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,890
A building fell on it.
Try to.

1398
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,950
The elevator won't take you up and now 
you stuck in that little elevator living

1399
01:05:02,951 --> 01:05:03,784
in a tunnel for the rest of your life to
death in there and you get clipped by 

1400
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,660
some other guy in a tesla going 120 
miles an hour in the tunnel.

1401
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,610
Get run over,
it was turning into rat tunnels.

1402
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,720
Not Big enough for you to walk in while 
there's cars in now.

1403
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,460
I think they recently changed the plan,
which is going to be these things called

1404
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:24,790
electric skates.
Which people get on like a subway car.

1405
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:25,631
Like a pod?
Yeah.

1406
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,760
Instead of your car getting in there,
but small,

1407
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:31,660
like only like 16 people shoot right to 
the airport.

1408
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,790
Shoot.
Right to downtown.

1409
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,430
Yeah.
It'd be pretty cool.

1410
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:38,860
But I don't know if I cluster,
probably it will kick in.

1411
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,500
And then there's another thing,
the hyperloop,

1412
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:44,800
he's doing that hyperloop thing to the 
hyperloop is the uh,

1413
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:47,530
that's the fucking train that goes to 
San Francisco.

1414
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,770
That's him too.
Yeah Dude.

1415
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,840
The fuck.
Just keep doing it.

1416
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,850
But this is the crazy thing.
It's one guy.

1417
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,120
Like how is this one guy that 
innovative,

1418
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,610
that smart?
I don't know.

1419
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:01,893
He's a.
But is he funny sometimes he's a comedy 

1420
01:06:07,181 --> 01:06:08,480
fan store.
He,

1421
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,520
yeah,
he's been to the store.

1422
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,830
It was at Largo with Johnny Dep secs.

1423
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:14,950
Oh boy.
Got that loose though.

1424
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:15,940
That's the only.
Oh,

1425
01:06:15,941 --> 01:06:17,440
he did good.
Smart Guy.

1426
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,393
Smart Guy.
That was my only time I worried about 

1427
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:21,771
him.
I saw him like,

1428
01:06:21,771 --> 01:06:22,780
you know,
some events was like,

1429
01:06:22,781 --> 01:06:24,550
oh no,
what is he doing?

1430
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,290
You'd probably just get some of that 
crazy posts.

1431
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:27,640
I just googled hyperloop.
Beautiful.

1432
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:30,250
Not being associated with him.
I know he is doing that,

1433
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:33,520
but I might not be the only person.
Or are you just involved in the project?

1434
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:34,870
It's a different.
Could be.

1435
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:40,300
Well he's also involved in the fucking 
rocket project to space x.

1436
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:41,480
he's going to Mars.
Yeah,

1437
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:44,960
that's what I wanted to ask you.
Uh,

1438
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,830
if you talked about Three d printing a 
couple times we've talked to.

1439
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:53,050
I just watched the recent vice on three 
d printing.

1440
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,210
Pretty amazing.
Oh my God.

1441
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,090
Yeah.
They wanted,

1442
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:57,520
um,
who has one?

1443
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:58,860
That guy,
um,

1444
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,450
with crazy.

1445
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:01,840
You're fucking puppet guy.
Jeff.

1446
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:03,530
Jeff Dunham.
Yeah.

1447
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,160
He makes puppets with him.
He makes a lot of shit with them.

1448
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,380
He was on Opie and Anthony back in the 
day apparently.

1449
01:07:08,381 --> 01:07:09,214
He's like a super tech Geek and he was 
on Opie and Anthony back in the day and 

1450
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:13,684
he was talking.
He had like one of the earlier three d 

1451
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:17,110
printers.
Really?

1452
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,340
Yeah.
They're getting really,

1453
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:19,510
really complex.
Mike,

1454
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:20,383
they're making human hearts.
They're making human ears there is 

1455
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,710
making the mobile controlled chaos.
Jeff Dunham,

1456
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:30,220
so he does all this stuff himself.
He's a fucking character.

1457
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:31,510
Jeff Dunham.
Yeah.

1458
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,430
Interesting guy.
That's amazing.

1459
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:34,723
You put anything in the computer like 
actually there was showed like a 

1460
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:38,434
dishwasher and the guy wanted to 
manufacture the part that's inside the 

1461
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,120
dishwasher.
The computer says,

1462
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:44,883
no,
we can improve on that part and we're 

1463
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:47,374
going to alter the shape of it and have 
it be like this and then it makes that 

1464
01:07:50,561 --> 01:07:53,650
and then you use it.
It's getting so crazy.

1465
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:58,710
You won't see human cells in there 
making ears and skin and it's amazing.

1466
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:02,860
They think that in the future you won't 
be buying things.

1467
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:07,570
You'll be downloading schematics and 
then getting the raw materials,

1468
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,793
the raw materials you'll have like in 
your machine somehow or another and 

1469
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:15,100
it'll make whatever you need.
Like say if you need a French press,

1470
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,010
it'll make

1471
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,600
a French press.
It will three d print,

1472
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:20,510
a French press for you.
You won't go to the store and buy one,

1473
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:21,344
you'll just download the whatever it is.
You don't need a manufacturer and no 

1474
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:28,280
one's going to be in this business of 
making presses less.

1475
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,203
I mean less and less and.
But the thing is like more and more 

1476
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:32,174
demand will be for things like this 
table or craftsmanship or someone makes 

1477
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,010
something for you.
Right,

1478
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:37,821
right.
Yeah.

1479
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:38,654
I mean,
which is kind of seeing that now like 

1480
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,970
people are getting,
you know,

1481
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:45,170
there's all these restaurants that are 
like kind of farm to table.

1482
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:46,004
They have wooden metal and everything 
like rustic and everything's kind of 

1483
01:08:49,881 --> 01:08:52,160
retro.
Everyone his armpit hair.

1484
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:55,320
That's not what we're talking about.
They had razors along.

1485
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,870
There's no excuse for girls to have 
armpit hair isn't a funny guys.

1486
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,360
It's fun.
I have on armpit hair.

1487
01:09:02,361 --> 01:09:04,610
Do you have armpit hair?
Do were men.

1488
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,650
If you don't have armpit hair.
I'm like,

1489
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:08,620
what happened?
You got a disease bro?

1490
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:12,240
Where you in a fire and alopecia?
Does your friend have a flame throwing?

1491
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:18,020
It's like a,
like girls with their junk,

1492
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:18,860
like,
okay,

1493
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:22,070
here's a perfect example.
Butthole hair on girls.

1494
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,580
Like when we were kids can't get enough 
standard.

1495
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:27,270
It was normal.
It was there,

1496
01:09:27,271 --> 01:09:28,600
it was chaos,
right?

1497
01:09:28,601 --> 01:09:29,434
It's just how you grew.
It was just a big fucking pile of 

1498
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:34,040
whatever.
And nowadays if you're a girl,

1499
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:35,030
you're young,
single gallon,

1500
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,670
got bottle hair,
you're taking some risks,

1501
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:38,840
right?
You're like,

1502
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,760
I don't care,
love me who I am.

1503
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:41,793
He must be an older man because that's 
the only one that can accept me for who 

1504
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:45,014
I am.
Like,

1505
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:46,970
no,
no,

1506
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:49,250
we're not doing that anymore.
We're trying to evolve.

1507
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,130
And first thing that's evolving is 
women's hair.

1508
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:55,080
You gotta start somewhere,
right?

1509
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:57,440
Like how many women when you go to the 
beach,

1510
01:09:57,441 --> 01:10:00,200
how many women shaved their legs?
All of all of them.

1511
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,093
That's fucking crazy.
Like it's weird like the grooming 

1512
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:08,450
standards that we've imposed on women,
like the culture is imposed on women.

1513
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:10,190
It's pretty crazy.
It's fucking crazy.

1514
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:15,191
It's so crazy in comparison to us like 
you and I fucking hairy armpits.

1515
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:18,980
Shit.
I've one patch of hair on my back.

1516
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:19,910
Oh yeah,
like a wolf.

1517
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:20,744
Just like one side.
Like when the American Werewolf in 

1518
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:24,134
London,
the transformation sequences stopped 

1519
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,670
quarter way through.
It's funny,

1520
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,380
I mean the,
the standards.

1521
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,790
Yeah,
it's weird.

1522
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,350
It's very weird.
It's weird,

1523
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:35,590
but it's,
it's also weird is that uh,

1524
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:38,540
people who are really poor women who 
were really progressive,

1525
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:39,374
still like doing certain parts of it.
That for me as a man watching it is 

1526
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:44,090
always like,
yeah,

1527
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:46,040
we're all the same and let's own it and 
stuff,

1528
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:51,041
but I'm still going to put this big,
big line on my eyes to make it look like

1529
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:55,730
I'm going to put extra lashes on to make
it look like it's weird.

1530
01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:00,530
Like the,
what you choose to sculpted eyebrows and

1531
01:11:00,531 --> 01:11:02,180
shit.
Eyebrows.

1532
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,950
Some dudes.
Sculptor eyebrows.

1533
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,473
Yeah.
Got To work for those guys because they 

1534
01:11:07,211 --> 01:11:08,570
were in.
Starts with an F,

1535
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:13,840
ends with a t in it rhymes a faggot.
A cabaret star.

1536
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,750
Yes.
It's a bundle of wood.

1537
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,231
Know it's,
uh,

1538
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:19,951
it's,
yeah,

1539
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:21,750
it's very bizarre.
I always feel like.

1540
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:24,960
But they also like,
it's empowering to feel good and it does

1541
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:25,794
make women feel good to be in heels and 
well then there's different standards 

1542
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:30,810
for gay folks.
Like gay guys,

1543
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,350
they do it way different and by the way,
when I use that effort,

1544
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:37,050
I should not use that and definitely 
wouldn't use it for gay guys.

1545
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,550
We know.
Consider the source.

1546
01:11:38,551 --> 01:11:39,384
Had to be careful though.
Got To be careful in today's day and 

1547
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:41,821
age.
Yeah,

1548
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:44,520
but people know you're a good person.
Some people don't.

1549
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,780
They know you're making it.
Show people are.

1550
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:49,710
It's a dangerous time.
Any of the Lampanelli thing.

1551
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,023
What happened?
She was screaming at a an audience 

1552
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:54,030
member,
like,

1553
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:55,470
like really?
Completely.

1554
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:58,740
Which charts?
I think it just happened last night.

1555
01:11:58,741 --> 01:12:00,390
I don't know.
I mean I heard it on the radio.

1556
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:05,630
She's like screaming yo up bed.
Did you see that?

1557
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:08,670
She yelled at them,
call them bitches onstage.

1558
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:11,970
Nuclear meltdown.
Fan hands or a $100 to shut up.

1559
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,940
She goes on.
She have blue on her hair.

1560
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:18,000
She's got blue on her hair.
Nuclear meltdown.

1561
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:19,823
Someone tried to say something in the 
middle of her set and she just goes 

1562
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,920
batshit crazy what?

1563
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:30,510
She went nuclear on a fan who gave her 
$100 to shut up in the middle of her.

1564
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:32,420
Good.
Here's the thing,

1565
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:33,263
like why would someone,
why would someone pay her at a show to 

1566
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:42,930
go try to get her to shut up?
So after someone from the balcony,

1567
01:12:43,601 --> 01:12:47,490
he called her a cunt.
It all went downhill from there.

1568
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,670
How long is it going to be before you 
can't say that word anymore?

1569
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,640
I'm probably good to like next 
Wednesday.

1570
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:57,460
Yeah,
we're.

1571
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,520
We're running in the sand in the 
hourglass.

1572
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,880
Yeah.
Like I said,

1573
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,140
like when I just said Faggot,
I felt it.

1574
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:04,711
I'm like,
Ooh,

1575
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:06,630
this is a dangerous time to say that 
word.

1576
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:07,580
Yeah.
Say it anymore.

1577
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,060
Yeah.
No new,

1578
01:13:09,061 --> 01:13:09,840
new,
new.

1579
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,673
Even as a joke.
Even not even calling an individual 

1580
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:16,020
person.
It just saying the noise.

1581
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,033
That is that word.
Like it's get down to the like you'd 

1582
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,470
have to call it the other f word for 
word.

1583
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,140
It's clearly established,
right?

1584
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:29,190
Say it all the time.
People even say it on stage and a comedy

1585
01:13:29,191 --> 01:13:30,024
set.
They'll say the n word say the n Word 

1586
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,080
Ran,
where they won't say no,

1587
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:33,550
no,
no.

1588
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:35,690
And if they do say it people.
Oh,

1589
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:37,410
gas.
Yes.

1590
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,120
Forget it from the crowd.
Get it now.

1591
01:13:40,121 --> 01:13:42,550
That's gone,
but Jane retarded about.

1592
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:43,650
Yeah,
pretty much.

1593
01:13:43,651 --> 01:13:44,610
Yeah.
I'm retarded is.

1594
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:47,340
I think it's probably bad,
but you can say it,

1595
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,170
but the way you're saying it,
you could say retarded,

1596
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:50,660
right?
Right.

1597
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,390
The end where we won't say that now you 
want him saying I'm too scared.

1598
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:58,800
It's the word bigger,
but without the bee with a different,

1599
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:01,170
with an end in it.
I can't even do that.

1600
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,210
I'm done.
I can't even say bigger,

1601
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:04,740
but without a B,
with an end.

1602
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,633
That's how tricky it is.
I'm just feeling for the keys in my 

1603
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:07,680
pocket.

1604
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,260
Damage.
Terrified.

1605
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:12,550
Jamie,
you were telling me about who,

1606
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:16,000
what was the rap concert where the girl 
got on stage and she was saying,

1607
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:17,710
yeah,
the Kendrick Lamar concert.

1608
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,490
Which uh,
so I guess there's a song that happens a

1609
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,323
lot.
You can see lots of videos if the 

1610
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:26,350
crowd's singing all the words,
which has a lot of words in it,

1611
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,080
including white people in the crowd.
Correct.

1612
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:29,860
Yeah,
lots of.

1613
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:30,780
Well that's the way mainly.
Well,

1614
01:14:30,781 --> 01:14:31,240
yeah.
So,

1615
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,960
uh,
yeah,

1616
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,770
I'll,
I'll pull one up as Alabama.

1617
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,690
The hangout fest will to grow up on 
stage.

1618
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:41,140
She was obviously drunk,
kind of almost set her up to to do it.

1619
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,330
He said like two or three times he 
stopped.

1620
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:44,290
It.
Stopped the whole thing.

1621
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,900
Well,
what did she say in reference to?

1622
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:47,500
Just.
It's a.

1623
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,220
it's in the song.
So she was doing like Karaoke,

1624
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,810
like a song lyric.
Yeah.

1625
01:14:52,811 --> 01:14:55,240
I'll pull up the videos and then he 
turned on her.

1626
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:58,191
No,
no,

1627
01:14:58,191 --> 01:14:58,601
no,
no.

1628
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,570
That's not for you.
That's only for.

1629
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,451
Oh wait,
wait,

1630
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:01,811
wait,
wait,

1631
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:04,720
wait.
That's meme were up.

1632
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,000
I had a bit from 2009.
Yeah.

1633
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:12,760
My Spike TV special here.
Woman gets onstage

1634
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:20,390
when you're ready.
Oh,

1635
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,090
and she's going to do it.
Oh my God.

1636
01:15:25,091 --> 01:15:26,940
She's set her up.
Yeah,

1637
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,300
it's terrible.
She said,

1638
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:34,350
well we started.
We started mocking her already.

1639
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:40,470
Yeah.
Wow.

1640
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:50,730
She must be.
So are we playing this over?

1641
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:59,740
You get pulled out.
What happens?

1642
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:17,400
Jesus Christ.
That's terrible.

1643
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:29,460
Crazy.
Everybody was just really cool,

1644
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,233
bro.
You gotta you gotTa make one single 

1645
01:16:36,981 --> 01:16:38,260
word.
Oh,

1646
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:42,350
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

1647
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:50,980
They're all up.
The Sun's down.

1648
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:52,830
Get up.
You said the noise.

1649
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:56,490
He says that we love.
You can't say the noise.

1650
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,353
That's mostly it.
Hilarious and preposterous times mean 

1651
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:09,680
that is so strange.
That is his song.

1652
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,130
He wrote a song,
he wrote the word says she loves him,

1653
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:15,140
she loves him.
She's at his concert.

1654
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,360
He gave her the microphone,
played the song,

1655
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,400
she's singing the song that he loves,
that he wrote.

1656
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:26,430
Now audience loves and everybody's like,
you did the wrong thing.

1657
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:30,280
You made the noise.
So wow.

1658
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:36,090
Crowd doing it though.
This whole crowd is mostly white.

1659
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:45,600
Okay,
so how's that word?

1660
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:47,530
I ain't got a double standard.
I know.

1661
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:49,760
This is why I stayed home.
Wait a minute.

1662
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:53,380
How does that work?
So there's a lot of people there.

1663
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:55,210
Yeah,
you can do it.

1664
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,130
You can do it if there's a bunch of 
people there.

1665
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:59,710
If you can't do it,
if you're by yourself.

1666
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:02,920
No onstage by yourself in front of those
people,

1667
01:18:02,921 --> 01:18:03,754
you can't do it.
But if you're in with them you could do 

1668
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:06,310
it.
Yes.

1669
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:07,263
And that was mostly white.
There was a lot of white there in the 

1670
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,960
course in that white people are 
ridiculous.

1671
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,600
So confused.
So confused.

1672
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:14,763
I mean this is a strange time.
I was gonna say I did this spike TV 

1673
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:22,440
special in 2009 and there was a.
do you remember that old commercial with

1674
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,960
the guy or the girl comes home and her 
dog started talking to her.

1675
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,823
Like,
Lindsay,

1676
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:30,100
I really wish you wouldn't smoke pump.
You're not the senior smoke pot.

1677
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:35,140
And I miss my friend.
I had this whole thing where I was like,

1678
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,960
I was like,
first of all,

1679
01:18:37,961 --> 01:18:38,794
whatever that checks on,
she's not on pot because if you were on 

1680
01:18:40,901 --> 01:18:43,030
pot you'd be like,
wait a minute,

1681
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,073
my fucking dog and talk.
How long have you been able to talk to 

1682
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,380
Daddy?
My whole fucking life.

1683
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:51,750
This is the first shit you said,
right?

1684
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,460
You know,
and I went through this whole thing that

1685
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:58,270
I call my dog a faggot.
This guy,

1686
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,660
this was like in the beginning of 
political correctness,

1687
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:02,140
right?
Because it was 2009.

1688
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,760
He,
this is a gay guy,

1689
01:19:03,761 --> 01:19:05,500
said to me.
He goes,

1690
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,570
you can't say that word.
That's our nigger.

1691
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,290
That's our word,
right?

1692
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:11,350
That's what he said,
right?

1693
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:12,460
He literally said,
I go,

1694
01:19:12,461 --> 01:19:14,200
wait a minute.
What'd you just say?

1695
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:15,760
Yeah.
And he said it again,

1696
01:19:15,761 --> 01:19:18,040
you said it's our nigger.
We're allowed to say it.

1697
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:19,540
You can't say that.
I go,

1698
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:22,540
that's the gay shit I've ever heard.
He started laughing.

1699
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,210
I go,
that's so crazy.

1700
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,340
You can't go.
I'm talking to a dog.

1701
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:31,810
I'm talking.
I'm angry at a dog because I've had this

1702
01:19:31,811 --> 01:19:33,940
dog my whole life.
His first words out of his mouth.

1703
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:36,620
I tell you I love you every day.
And,

1704
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:38,370
and what do you say?
You say a wish.

1705
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,660
You wouldn't smoke weed.
Hey,

1706
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,010
fuck you stupid.
I smoke weed.

1707
01:19:42,011 --> 01:19:44,110
Not go to work and I pay for your food.
Faggot.

1708
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:45,840
Like that was.
That was the joke.

1709
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:49,220
And he got.
He got like,

1710
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:54,840
these rules are preposterous.
Isn't it supposed to be about intent UK?

1711
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:55,743
Isn't it supposed to be like I'm 
supposed to be conveying how I feel and 

1712
01:19:59,471 --> 01:20:02,650
the words are supposed to mirror my 
thoughts.

1713
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:08,100
Like when you have magic words that you 
can't say in this case with the n

1714
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,740
word,
it's even crazier because it's like some

1715
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:12,900
people could say it,
you could say it sometimes.

1716
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:17,901
Sometimes you can't say it's too heavy.
What bought black people could say it,

1717
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:18,983
why people can't,
but white people can say it if we're in 

1718
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:21,444
the crowd and they're yelling it out,
but as long as there's an a on the end 

1719
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,050
of it.

1720
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:25,370
Yeah,
right.

1721
01:20:25,371 --> 01:20:27,320
Exactly.
The Er is what gets you in trouble.

1722
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:28,150
Well,
look,

1723
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:31,130
racism is disgusting.
All Racist.

1724
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,740
Racism against Chinese people,
racism against white people.

1725
01:20:35,741 --> 01:20:38,470
Racism against every.
Of course against black people,

1726
01:20:38,471 --> 01:20:39,304
of course,
against everyone judging someone on 

1727
01:20:41,201 --> 01:20:43,060
something that they have no control 
over.

1728
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,790
That's what it is like you are when 
you're born,

1729
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:46,751
whatever.
You're born,

1730
01:20:46,751 --> 01:20:47,590
Irish,
German,

1731
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:48,940
Italian,
African.

1732
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:50,520
You're born.
It's not you.

1733
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:53,020
You're just who you are.
Right?

1734
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,830
So racism is disgusting,
but is that,

1735
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:57,693
is it racism?
When you have that girl on stage and 

1736
01:21:00,191 --> 01:21:02,680
she's singing that song that she loves,
that you sing,

1737
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:05,860
it's your song like that's not really 
racism.

1738
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:06,694
No.
So when she's singing along and 

1739
01:21:08,021 --> 01:21:13,021
everybody's you racist fucking Nazi,
like what are we doing?

1740
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,300
Right?
Because this is what we're doing here is

1741
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,350
we're,
we,

1742
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,513
we've gone into some ridiculous zone 
where it doesn't make any sense because 

1743
01:21:22,751 --> 01:21:25,100
we know that's not her intent and know 
exactly right.

1744
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,910
Actual exercise.
Exactly.

1745
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:28,803
It becomes like a word game.
It's a little puzzle kind of thing that 

1746
01:21:30,791 --> 01:21:34,540
we're doing to trap this person.
You say she's very innocent up there.

1747
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:35,374
They all know she's a little drunk.
It's kind of like setting someone up to 

1748
01:21:37,571 --> 01:21:38,890
do something.
Yeah,

1749
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:40,360
it's pretty gross.

1750
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:43,290
It's just weird.
But it's weird that it's so universal.

1751
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:45,540
Like that crowd that was probably 20,000
people.

1752
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,383
No,

1753
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:49,910
they had a weird thing on,
you know,

1754
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:51,133
I,
I'm,

1755
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:52,523
I'm on the show live from here,
the old prairie home companion show and 

1756
01:21:55,701 --> 01:21:56,960
uh,
you know,

1757
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:59,920
I'm the writer for it and stuff.
Had writer on it,

1758
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,060
appear on it and stuff.
Anyway,

1759
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,620
I'm very involved with the show.
Uh,

1760
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:05,893
Chris,
who's this bluegrass guy who plays a 

1761
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:10,640
mandolin,
who's amazing,

1762
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,240
the kindest person you'll ever meet,
like super,

1763
01:22:14,241 --> 01:22:16,490
super sweet,
sweet person,

1764
01:22:16,491 --> 01:22:19,310
like,
like Mr Rogers in a way.

1765
01:22:19,311 --> 01:22:20,144
Like it's to that level of kindness and 
he sings everybody's birthdays and 

1766
01:22:24,011 --> 01:22:24,844
stuff.
And he sings different songs and as 

1767
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:27,621
attributes,
everything.

1768
01:22:27,621 --> 01:22:29,150
He loves all music.
He loves everything.

1769
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:33,470
He sang a Kendrick Lamar Song,
he sang a little bit of it,

1770
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:34,670
uh,
in like,

1771
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:35,503
because it was his birthday that week 
and he got so much hate online that a 

1772
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:42,890
white person can't be singing that song.
What is the song about?

1773
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,780
It's,
I don't know,

1774
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,430
but it wasn't,
that wasn't the thing.

1775
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:49,250
It was the word.
It was that he was,

1776
01:22:49,251 --> 01:22:50,084
um,
what's the thing that you take some 

1777
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:53,800
cultural appropriation that he's not 
allowed to sing.

1778
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:58,990
And meanwhile he's singing bluegrass 
Indian music from all around the world.

1779
01:22:59,691 --> 01:23:02,510
This is a kind soul celebrating 
everything.

1780
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,120
And it really freaked him out because he
is so nice.

1781
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,040
He couldn't believe the

1782
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,873
hate that he got from it.
That now he's super sensitive about 

1783
01:23:08,801 --> 01:23:11,290
singing that music at all.
It's not logical.

1784
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,470
It's not like you have to put your foot 
down and you consider the source.

1785
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,573
Culturally,
we have to put our foot down because 

1786
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:17,434
we're going down this very strange,
illogical road where you could just 

1787
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:20,884
decide what's evil and what's bad and it
doesn't have any bearing on the thought 

1788
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:26,710
or the intent behind it is.
Look,

1789
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:29,830
they went after Bruno Mars,
like,

1790
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:32,200
get in the.
Just get the fuck outta here.

1791
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,920
They accused Bruno Mars of cultural 
appropriation.

1792
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:37,270
What culture?
He's everything.

1793
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,790
He's everything.
He's like the per meanwhile,

1794
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:43,060
what is he doing where anybody would 
accuse him of cultural appropriation.

1795
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:45,040
He sings these beautiful fucking songs.
Oh,

1796
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:46,930
he's a light.
A light in this world.

1797
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,750
He's amazing.
I love that guy.

1798
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:49,840
Oh,
the guy's amazing.

1799
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:50,693
Voice is fantastic and his songs are fun
and they're catchy and I love listening 

1800
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:55,000
to them.

1801
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,510
I saw them in Vegas in concert.
It was just the most uplifting,

1802
01:23:58,511 --> 01:23:59,344
bright thing.
You know what made me happy though is 

1803
01:24:01,031 --> 01:24:05,260
that a bunch of black artists said,
fuck you.

1804
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:07,750
He's great.
Like the original charge,

1805
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:08,613
just fucking social justice warriors.
We're going after him for cultural 

1806
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:11,944
appropriation.
All these super progressive angry 

1807
01:24:13,901 --> 01:24:17,650
fuckheads will decide whatever man.
It doesn't have to make sense.

1808
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:20,680
This is the thing,
they're just looking for targets.

1809
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,053
It doesn't have to make sense.
This is not like a logical progression 

1810
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:26,171
like,
oh,

1811
01:24:26,171 --> 01:24:28,000
Bruno Mars is still.
It's not like,

1812
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,133
oh,
he's stealing from these old blues 

1813
01:24:30,731 --> 01:24:35,140
singers and he's not crediting them and 
he's a white guy from Kentucky.

1814
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:36,480
That's not what we're dealing with.
Right.

1815
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:37,503
We're dealing with a multiracial guy who
sings these beautiful songs that they 

1816
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:43,120
don't.
They're not cultural appropriation.

1817
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:44,620
Even if he was white and.
Yeah,

1818
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,880
no,
exactly.

1819
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,790
It's just a joy of music and music is a 
mix of everything.

1820
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:49,624
It's a mix of all of us,
of everything that is good coming into 

1821
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,790
saying like his style,
but if that's the case,

1822
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,863
then here's the case.
I'm a fucking huge fan of the black 

1823
01:24:58,001 --> 01:24:59,980
keys,
the black keys,

1824
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:04,390
a whole lot of their shit is blues.
A lot of his old blues,

1825
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:08,260
like it sounds so similar to some great 
old blues.

1826
01:25:08,261 --> 01:25:11,020
Sure is that cultural appropriation?
I mean,

1827
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,870
I love them.
I mean you saying they should stop doing

1828
01:25:13,871 --> 01:25:16,390
what I what I love to hear now.
Come on.

1829
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:17,741
What are we doing?
Yeah,

1830
01:25:17,741 --> 01:25:19,000
that's crazy.
But what is it?

1831
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,130
What did you know what the other part of
it is?

1832
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:24,520
How many people are really complaining 
about that stuff?

1833
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,650
It's a very small amount,
but it's so small,

1834
01:25:26,651 --> 01:25:28,660
but it's enough where your friend got 
scared.

1835
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:32,410
He did get scared and it literally 
amounts to probably three tweets.

1836
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,340
You know what I mean?
It's like,

1837
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,260
but those people,
that's the only noise.

1838
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:36,760
People aren't saying,
wow,

1839
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:39,640
I love that version because they just 
like it in the normal people.

1840
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,593
It's these haters that just want to do 
it and the people in control of it have 

1841
01:25:44,021 --> 01:25:49,021
to calm him and make him realize we've 
got your back day Bronco.

1842
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:51,970
They'll fucking fire him if it gets loud
enough.

1843
01:25:51,971 --> 01:25:55,350
It doesn't have to make any sense.
That's where it's squirrely today.

1844
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,310
Fired speaking to prairie home 
companion.

1845
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:00,130
They fired garrison keillor.
I know they fired him,

1846
01:26:00,131 --> 01:26:04,040
removed his name for everything because 
he hugged the lady and his hand went

1847
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,400
down her back and then he apologized,
sent her an email.

1848
01:26:07,401 --> 01:26:08,270
She said,
it's fine.

1849
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:11,150
They went back and forth with it.
Didn't do anything else.

1850
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,970
No history of sexual harassment,
sexual assault,

1851
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,040
no.
History of anything terrible.

1852
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:19,760
Years later when all this stuff comes 
out,

1853
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:22,310
she comes out with that.
It was dirty business,

1854
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:23,930
it was dirty,
it's dirty,

1855
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:26,270
but it doesn't.
It's not logical.

1856
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:27,123
Right?
It's like there's this fever feeding 

1857
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:32,450
frenzy that goes on with these things.
It's mob mentality.

1858
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,430
Yeah.
That just wanted to tear people down.

1859
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,800
They want to tear people apart,
really believe that you have to,

1860
01:26:36,801 --> 01:26:39,560
in all these situations is considered 
the source.

1861
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:40,453
Like you really have to consider.
It's like when the steroid thing went 

1862
01:26:42,951 --> 01:26:44,170
down,
there were like,

1863
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:45,373
people came at Barry bonds harder than 
everybody else because he had a rap for 

1864
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:51,800
not being a good guy.
He people did not like him regardless of

1865
01:26:51,801 --> 01:26:53,240
that.
So when it happens,

1866
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,770
people kind of come after him.
Harder than the came after San Francisco

1867
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:57,163
a yes and yeah,
and much harder than like Andy Pettitte 

1868
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:01,874
or you know,
he's a pitcher for the Yankees and it's 

1869
01:27:04,091 --> 01:27:05,760
just like a nice guy and he doesn't cut 
it,

1870
01:27:05,761 --> 01:27:08,270
you know?
But if somebody is a problem,

1871
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:09,163
Jose Conseco,
it was a problem because he ratted 

1872
01:27:11,421 --> 01:27:12,590
everybody out.
Oh yeah,

1873
01:27:12,591 --> 01:27:14,150
that's right.
That book called juiced.

1874
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:15,500
Yeah,
boy dogs,

1875
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:18,500
everything that made him persona non 
grata,

1876
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,160
like he kind of disappeared.
He got written off from that book,

1877
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,990
but people just decided,
fuck you.

1878
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:25,160
Yeah.
That's interesting.

1879
01:27:25,161 --> 01:27:25,910
Right?
It is.

1880
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:26,743
It is.

1881
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:29,250
Yeah.
Too much of a snitch I guess.

1882
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:30,211
Yeah,
man.

1883
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:31,044
People just didn't respect him after 
that because there was so many people 

1884
01:27:33,631 --> 01:27:34,464
that were also doing it and he was the 
one that ratted everybody out and 

1885
01:27:36,511 --> 01:27:38,010
profited off of it.
Yeah,

1886
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:39,930
there's some,
there's some justice,

1887
01:27:39,931 --> 01:27:44,700
some street justice in that.
I just think that there's a little to be

1888
01:27:44,701 --> 01:27:49,650
really careful with,
but it's just there's also an issue that

1889
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:50,963
everyone has access to social media and 
everyone has the ability to complain 

1890
01:27:55,981 --> 01:27:57,120
about things.
Yeah.

1891
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,740
So buddy,
there's a world,

1892
01:27:58,741 --> 01:28:01,480
right?
So there's a lot of noise kind of it.

1893
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,870
Yeah.
You get the real sound like,

1894
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,153
like there are things that happen that 
are really bad and when something 

1895
01:28:08,311 --> 01:28:09,610
happens it's really bad.
Yeah.

1896
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:10,583
The,
the twitter mob and the all the people 

1897
01:28:12,451 --> 01:28:15,800
that go after these people for something
that's legitimately awful.

1898
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,640
Sure.
It makes sense.

1899
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:18,391
Yeah.
I mean it's,

1900
01:28:18,391 --> 01:28:19,710
there's,
there's justice to it,

1901
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:23,940
but there's also like this constant 
looking for targets.

1902
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:24,963
Yes.
It seems like that's kind of like a 

1903
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:31,890
hobby of some people like that is $100 
just to go out and pick people off.

1904
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:33,050
Yeah,
it's awful.

1905
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:33,923
It's a horrible thing.
It is up because then it's [inaudible] 

1906
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:39,220
at its best.
It's a really wonderful thing.

1907
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,353
It's a celebrate story thing that you 
have this community that you share with 

1908
01:28:42,911 --> 01:28:43,744
and think about.
Like you can see things from all around 

1909
01:28:45,761 --> 01:28:47,520
the world.
You could see cultures,

1910
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:48,363
you could see young people doing amazing
things in all these different little 

1911
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:54,940
tiny spots around the.
I mean in so many ways.

1912
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:56,343
It's beautiful,
but then there's just like this little 

1913
01:29:00,071 --> 01:29:02,100
dark underbelly of like

1914
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,933
hate.
They're really just is good and bad in 

1915
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:07,980
the world and there are,
there is good and bad in the world,

1916
01:29:07,981 --> 01:29:12,981
but there's also people that are just 
very frustrated and looking to vent that

1917
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:17,910
frustration as often as they can.
Whatever targets they find to be viable.

1918
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:19,043
It's not like they've carefully 
considered the issue and carefully 

1919
01:29:21,781 --> 01:29:23,390
consider this person stands on it.
Like,

1920
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:24,383
no for me,
one of the big ones was the Roseanne 

1921
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:31,190
Barr thing because Roseanne Barr,
what she said seemed racist,

1922
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:33,420
right?
You look at it on the surface,

1923
01:29:33,421 --> 01:29:36,300
she called that lady something like a 
cross between the Muslim Brotherhood and

1924
01:29:36,301 --> 01:29:39,710
the planet of the apes and like what 
Jesus calling a black woman and eight.

1925
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,160
Yeah.
She said she didn't even know that woman

1926
01:29:41,161 --> 01:29:43,260
was black and then you see her photo and
you go,

1927
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:44,190
oh,
okay.

1928
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:48,120
That woman is very racially ambiguous.
Like I talked to her on the phone.

1929
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,910
She told me she did not know that when 
she goes,

1930
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:54,060
you really think that I would call a 
black lady planet of the Apes.

1931
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:58,740
I'm not fucking stupid.
And that was her literal words.

1932
01:29:58,741 --> 01:29:59,760
She goes,
I didn't know.

1933
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:00,623
She goes,
I just was fucked up on Ambien and 

1934
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:06,060
drinking all weekend and tweeting a 
bunch of stupid shit.

1935
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:07,860
Her own words.
She's like,

1936
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,930
I didn't know what I was saying.
Right.

1937
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,400
And no one cares.
No one cares that you got to.

1938
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:16,760
A lady who has mental illness,
like a history of mental illness is on a

1939
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:17,603
host of different medications,
is on Ambien as well and drinking and 

1940
01:30:21,091 --> 01:30:22,140
smoking pot.
No one cares.

1941
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:23,183
You compared a black woman to planet of 
the apes and then all these people made 

1942
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:29,394
these memes where they put a photo of 
that woman next to that woman from the 

1943
01:30:32,941 --> 01:30:35,280
planet of the apes and like,
you know,

1944
01:30:35,281 --> 01:30:37,770
you see like why she was joking around 
about it,

1945
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:39,150
but it's totally off limits.

1946
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:41,820
So they've decided she's this horrible 
racist,

1947
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:47,030
forget about all her years of people 
loving her and she also has,

1948
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,130
if you go back to the source kind of 
thing,

1949
01:30:50,131 --> 01:30:52,720
it's like there's a picture of her just 
like a Nazi.

1950
01:30:52,721 --> 01:30:54,420
There's Jewish.
I know,

1951
01:30:54,421 --> 01:30:55,740
but there's like,
there's enough.

1952
01:30:55,770 --> 01:31:00,000
She's always tweeting bombastic stuff.
So when she's got issue it's not.

1953
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:01,150
Yeah.
So it's not like.

1954
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:02,263
It's not like somebody like Rachel Ray 
just making muffins and all of a sudden 

1955
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:06,834
one tweet comes out.
She's in that area and I think when 

1956
01:31:09,601 --> 01:31:10,434
you're in that area and you're spewing 
hate and you're throwing fireballs and 

1957
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:15,900
stuff,
whether you have good intent or not,

1958
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:19,260
you're in that arena.
You can get burned by it.

1959
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,153
Yeah.
She's.

1960
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:22,030
Yeah,
she's in total shitster.

1961
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:22,993
Remember the national anthem?
She grabs her crotch and spits on the 

1962
01:31:24,781 --> 01:31:27,480
ground and apparently everyone fucking 
was super.

1963
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:30,750
She was scared right after that because 
that's a patriotic thing.

1964
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:31,920
Oh yeah.
You don't fuck.

1965
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:35,100
Got To go home.
People were mad.

1966
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:37,710
I remember that.
The the issue that I'm with,

1967
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:38,573
Rosanne to me is not even that tweet.
Not even even the recent planet of the 

1968
01:31:43,021 --> 01:31:43,854
apes one,
it's an earlier one that she made five 

1969
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:48,000
years ago,
which is much more racist.

1970
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,560
Were hilly about.
Yeah,

1971
01:31:49,561 --> 01:31:50,394
about Susan Rice where she said Susan 
Rice is a man with big swinging eight 

1972
01:31:54,451 --> 01:31:56,750
balls.
Well that,

1973
01:31:56,770 --> 01:32:00,130
and you're talking about an absolutely 
black woman.

1974
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,990
There's not.
There's something there.

1975
01:32:02,991 --> 01:32:04,540
There's the.
That's the thing.

1976
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:05,374
It's the source.
It's like there's this person that has 

1977
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:08,254
all of this kind of stuff and she's 
always showing up to the line and not 

1978
01:32:11,411 --> 01:32:12,244
crossing it,
but maybe sometimes crossing and then 

1979
01:32:13,751 --> 01:32:15,430
you do it.
You're going to get popped.

1980
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:20,710
Do you remember when imus got kicked off
the radio for sand about some.

1981
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:23,890
Some gals who were athletes,
he called them nappy headed hos.

1982
01:32:23,891 --> 01:32:24,820
Oh yeah,
of course.

1983
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:27,420
And that was like,
whoa man,

1984
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,600
you know,
look,

1985
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:33,280
you want to play in those fire arenas,
you can get burned.

1986
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:34,323
You know?
Occasionally you drop some bombs and 

1987
01:32:35,831 --> 01:32:36,664
it's great.
Yeah,

1988
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:39,820
let me make some.
But if you're a shit stirrer right,

1989
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:42,670
if that's you're trying to drop bombs 
occasionally,

1990
01:32:42,671 --> 01:32:47,671
but the one shift going to land on you 
sometimes racist bombs are the ones that

1991
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:49,390
get you burned the most.

1992
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:53,950
We have not healed as a nation.
We're this very confused.

1993
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:55,270
We know.
It's like,

1994
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:58,000
you know,
we grew up like with a alcoholic,

1995
01:32:58,001 --> 01:33:02,230
dysfunctional fathers and there's like,
there's a sickness.

1996
01:33:02,231 --> 01:33:03,064
Like when you talked about how there's 
only 20 years between Hitler and my 

1997
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:06,874
Volkswagen coming out.
There's not that much time between the 

1998
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:13,150
most heinous part of that too.
Today.

1999
01:33:13,151 --> 01:33:16,370
I mean it's what's less than 200 years,
which is two lifetimes.

2000
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,000
It's raw.
There were a lot of times between us and

2001
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:20,740
slavery.
I think like just recently,

2002
01:33:20,741 --> 01:33:21,574
like the last person,
last African American person who was 

2003
01:33:23,921 --> 01:33:25,810
around during slavery just passed.
I mean,

2004
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:27,430
it's,
you know what I mean,

2005
01:33:27,431 --> 01:33:30,610
where we never healed.
We never had a discussion.

2006
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:33,580
We didn't go to therapy and forget about
just slavery.

2007
01:33:33,581 --> 01:33:35,110
How about the civil rights?
Yes.

2008
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:35,973
I mean,
how about in our lifetime hosing people 

2009
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:40,390
down with fire hoses and sicking dogs on
them.

2010
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,730
That was in,
if not our lifetime,

2011
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:44,710
just before we were born and still 
today,

2012
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:45,544
there's still,
you go to certain parts pop and stuff 

2013
01:33:47,861 --> 01:33:49,060
off and people,
you know,

2014
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:50,760
as a white guy,
you walk around,

2015
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:51,603
you hear people say Shit that because 
they think you're safe around you and 

2016
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:59,140
you look around you and like this guy 
has bred this guy.

2017
01:33:59,141 --> 01:34:01,840
He just bakes bread and stays home.
That's why I do it.

2018
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:03,520
I,
uh,

2019
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,870
it's tricky.
You know what I mean?

2020
01:34:04,871 --> 01:34:07,390
Like we have a,
that is our disease in our,

2021
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,313
in our culture,
there is a disease that we haven't met 

2022
01:34:10,631 --> 01:34:12,760
it out yet.
So of course like any.

2023
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:14,980
If you're going to pop off about that,
you're going to be.

2024
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:17,500
That's why.
Why are you,

2025
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:19,043
are you,
what's in you that makes you feel like 

2026
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:22,480
you need to turn that off?
Well,

2027
01:34:22,481 --> 01:34:23,314
if you're Roseanne,
that's her whole thing is getting this 

2028
01:34:25,271 --> 01:34:26,380
little reaction to other people.

2029
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:29,260
I mean a lot of comics,
that's their thing,

2030
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,540
right?
Little little,

2031
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,810
little controversial things to get a 
spark out of people.

2032
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,930
That's fine if you and look,
you know,

2033
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,830
I have a sensitivity that I don't even,
I don't want to go in that arena because

2034
01:34:41,831 --> 01:34:43,360
it's just,
I don't even do well.

2035
01:34:43,361 --> 01:34:45,910
So when people yell at right,
when people yell around me,

2036
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:48,220
I don't like it.
It's not me really.

2037
01:34:48,221 --> 01:34:52,230
But anything about anything,
I just don't ha.

2038
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:54,760
We're only here for a little while.
Why we going to fight?

2039
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:56,170
Right.
That's where I live.

2040
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,030
But people that do

2041
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,410
it and they.
Yes,

2042
01:34:59,411 --> 01:35:02,030
and they and they can read.
There are people that do it who can read

2043
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:04,430
tweets,
calling them horrible things and it just

2044
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:05,850
Kinda,
you know,

2045
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,870
bounces off and they don't really care,
but I don't think they read it.

2046
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,850
That's what they do.
Well,

2047
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:15,990
if you read tweets that are about people
that say horrible things to you,

2048
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,873
I mean you're going to respond to them 
and you're going to engage in dialogue 

2049
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:21,770
and then other people are going to join 
in.

2050
01:35:21,771 --> 01:35:23,780
You can respond to all of them.
You won't have any time.

2051
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,190
There's no.
There's no time.

2052
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,143
You won't.
Your whole day will be just speeding up 

2053
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:29,533
with new people jumping into the fray.
It's like if you want to have a 

2054
01:35:31,821 --> 01:35:33,950
fistfight with a mob,
a mob of people,

2055
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:38,900
you can't really do that because he's 
going to have a discussion with a one on

2056
01:35:38,901 --> 01:35:41,540
one person,
but if you fight a whole crowd of people

2057
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:42,470
like that,
Kendrick Lamar,

2058
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:44,240
if that lady was like,
fuck you bitch.

2059
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:45,323
I say that word like knuckles up and 
dives in the crowd starts throwing 

2060
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:51,044
haymakers going to get fucking killed.
But if she has a discussion with one of 

2061
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:58,760
those white guys is doing this booboo 
that was just yelling it out himself.

2062
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:02,030
If they put them alone in a room and she
said,

2063
01:36:02,031 --> 01:36:04,310
okay,
tell me why what I did was wrong.

2064
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:06,980
And he was like,
Ralphie May,

2065
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:10,910
it's just fucked up.
You shouldn't use that word.

2066
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,170
You know,
you can't use that word.

2067
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,190
It's like,
motherfucker,

2068
01:36:13,191 --> 01:36:15,390
you were saying it.
She's saying no,

2069
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:15,591
no,
no.

2070
01:36:15,591 --> 01:36:19,760
I say with everybody else and I make the
noise with my face.

2071
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:20,930
I was like,
I opened my mouth.

2072
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:23,150
I almost say about it.
Don't say no,

2073
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,433
don't say I don't say it.
I kind of started and then I let other 

2074
01:36:27,861 --> 01:36:28,694
people end it.
Like do the end part or I'll do the god 

2075
01:36:31,371 --> 01:36:33,680
part.
I don't do the in between.

2076
01:36:33,681 --> 01:36:36,980
I don't do a whole word because that way
I'm not racist.

2077
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,540
It's so complex.
It's too crazy.

2078
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:43,760
But it's not complex.
It's stupid.

2079
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:46,610
It is complex.
But what's complex about that?

2080
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:49,060
Well not that just that issue,
but what,

2081
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:49,993
what's complex about that to me is that 
you have a whole crowd of people 

2082
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:55,000
yelling,
responding this way.

2083
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:58,070
Like it's on their minds,
they're having these discussions that we

2084
01:36:58,071 --> 01:37:00,210
are trying to move things forward.
Other people trying to move in,

2085
01:37:00,211 --> 01:37:01,760
get back,
that is complex.

2086
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:04,220
Let's try and move it back who's 
actively saying,

2087
01:37:04,221 --> 01:37:05,054
I mean other than like white nationalist
groups that everybody pretty much hates 

2088
01:37:08,451 --> 01:37:09,284
other than themselves I guess and move 
it back and then other people who think 

2089
01:37:11,751 --> 01:37:12,584
that maybe that they're being that is 
being reversed and that they're being 

2090
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:16,573
hated on now when they white like young 
white kid who just wants to have a good 

2091
01:37:19,971 --> 01:37:21,430
time at the concert and the single wait,
wait,

2092
01:37:21,431 --> 01:37:22,890
but why are you attacking us?

2093
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:25,010
I were.
We were trying to be this way.

2094
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:25,903
Someone put up some fitness at a school 
that was criticized by a dean and was 

2095
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:29,834
taken down.
They put up these signs that say it's 

2096
01:37:31,521 --> 01:37:32,354
okay to be white [inaudible] from Google
that because this was kind of crazy and 

2097
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:41,670
that this whoever this dean was,
or whoever it was that he said,

2098
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:42,933
these people,
they put up these signs that said it's 

2099
01:37:44,781 --> 01:37:49,250
okay to be white and people were angry.
Yeah.

2100
01:37:49,251 --> 01:37:51,530
It's like white lives matter kind of 
thing.

2101
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:52,920
No,
just that statement.

2102
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,100
It's okay to be white.
Like why would have a problem with that?

2103
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:56,963
Like you didn't say that.
What are you thinking about people that 

2104
01:37:59,971 --> 01:38:00,990
aren't white?
What are you going to?

2105
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:02,190
Yeah,
that's what I mean.

2106
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:04,140
It is complex.
It's complex.

2107
01:38:04,141 --> 01:38:05,460
Or is that fucking stupid?
Here it is.

2108
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,740
Sign saying it's okay to be white.

2109
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:09,520
Found at Maryland.
Highschool.

2110
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:12,720
Found.
Found bomb.

2111
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:13,563
Yeah.
Yeah.

2112
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:15,210
Uh,
what does it say?

2113
01:38:15,211 --> 01:38:16,044
Something at 5:45
AM and removed by staff before students 

2114
01:38:20,191 --> 01:38:22,800
arrive for classes also say,
discovered them.

2115
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:25,320
We're taking this seriously.
Oh my God.

2116
01:38:25,321 --> 01:38:26,154
They sent a letter home to families 
informing them that the signs were 

2117
01:38:28,591 --> 01:38:29,424
discovered on 10 doors at 5:45
AM and removed by staff before students 

2118
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:34,194
arrive for classes.
We're taking this seriously and are 

2119
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:39,000
investigating this incident.
Wrote Renee Johnson,

2120
01:38:39,001 --> 01:38:39,834
the school's principal.
Our research so far has indicated this 

2121
01:38:42,391 --> 01:38:43,224
may be a part of a concerted national 
campaign to format racial and political 

2122
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:48,354
tension in our school and community.
The same flyer was posted in other 

2123
01:38:51,481 --> 01:38:53,700
cities and communities this week.
Okay.

2124
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:54,773
But here's the question.
Do you disagree with the sentiment of 

2125
01:38:57,991 --> 01:38:59,820
that statement?
It is okay to be white.

2126
01:38:59,821 --> 01:39:02,610
It's okay to be Chinese.
It's okay to be Indian.

2127
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,830
It's okay to be whatever the fuck you 
are.

2128
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:06,203
Not Okay to be racist.
Maybe if they wrote it's okay to be 

2129
01:39:07,831 --> 01:39:09,660
right.
It's not okay to be racist.

2130
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:10,643
Maybe if they did that,
would that be an issue that would've 

2131
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,530
been.
That would've helped write.

2132
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:14,411
That would have helped.
When you,

2133
01:39:14,411 --> 01:39:16,800
you know,
you walk into your school campus and all

2134
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:20,880
of a sudden there's signs up everywhere 
that normally there are no signs.

2135
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:21,743
Well,
if they feel if they're a white person 

2136
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:26,040
and they feel like they're being openly,
racially discriminated against,

2137
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:28,320
is it okay to say,
hey,

2138
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,600
it's all right to be white.
Is that okay?

2139
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:31,080
Yeah,
there's.

2140
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,010
Yes,
of course.

2141
01:39:32,011 --> 01:39:34,980
So what's wrong with that sign?
Because you pop them up in the middle of

2142
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:35,813
the night and put them all up on it and 
keystone come in with your little lunch 

2143
01:39:37,861 --> 01:39:38,694
bag and you're going to teach her 
Spanish class and on your doors a sign 

2144
01:39:41,581 --> 01:39:42,151
that says,
okay,

2145
01:39:42,151 --> 01:39:44,040
to be white,
you just,

2146
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:45,630
your knee jerk reaction is,
whoa.

2147
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:46,590
What?
What are you doing?

2148
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:48,133
The fliers appear to be a part of an 
online campaign that is detailed on the 

2149
01:39:51,961 --> 01:39:53,370
web forum.
Four Chan.

2150
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,320
Okay.
But is it a that.

2151
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:56,903
But is that saying that for chance,
talking about this online campaign or 

2152
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:02,550
this saying that four Chan started this 
online campaign.

2153
01:40:02,551 --> 01:40:03,384
I would lean towards that because it was
Halloween night and they discovered on 

2154
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:06,533
the article was posted November first.
So it's not like it's just a fun 

2155
01:40:09,811 --> 01:40:12,360
halloween prank,
but like people do do that stuff,

2156
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:14,330
you know?
It's like,

2157
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:16,150
yeah,
it's totally okay to think it.

2158
01:40:16,151 --> 01:40:16,984
And you know,
it's like the guy with the bumper 

2159
01:40:18,451 --> 01:40:19,284
stickers all over his car there.
Those guys are a little more unhinged 

2160
01:40:23,731 --> 01:40:24,900
than the other people.
It's like,

2161
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:26,070
yeah,
I think it's okay to be.

2162
01:40:26,071 --> 01:40:29,010
Why do I have to make a sign?
Do I have to go get copies?

2163
01:40:29,011 --> 01:40:31,380
Do I have to get some tape?
Do I have to sneak on campus?

2164
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:32,243
Do I have to put it up there?
There was an article in Washington Post 

2165
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,610
Google this.
This woman wrote this article,

2166
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,473
why can't we hate men?
And it was published in the Washington 

2167
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,170
Post and of course had a photo of Harvey
Weinstein.

2168
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:47,880
Who's a disgusting man.
Right?

2169
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:51,320
And this is the perfect example,
but that is literally like.

2170
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,080
It's like,
what does that mean?

2171
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:54,370
The worst

2172
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:56,260
white man?
Hitler,

2173
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,600
right?
Why can't we hate white men?

2174
01:40:58,830 --> 01:41:00,530
Because all white men are Hitler,
right?

2175
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:02,790
Can't we hate white people?
Is that what the article was?

2176
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:04,840
The Article?
I don't know what the article says.

2177
01:41:04,841 --> 01:41:05,674
I didn't read it,
but I mean like how could you write an 

2178
01:41:07,511 --> 01:41:11,770
article that says why can't we hate men?
Because you want to get.

2179
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:12,803
Unless you're trying to say we can hate 
men because men are human and we got to 

2180
01:41:15,161 --> 01:41:17,860
give everybody a chance and we can't 
generalize.

2181
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:20,830
Even if men have done horrible things,
I'd have to read it.

2182
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:21,400
I don't.
I mean,

2183
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:25,550
it's definitely the headline is made to 
make you want to read it.

2184
01:41:25,551 --> 01:41:26,550
It's click baity.
Yeah,

2185
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:27,760
it's it.
Exactly.

2186
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:28,713
It's fascinating.
How about we just take the hate out 

2187
01:41:30,311 --> 01:41:31,900
guys?
Can we just do that?

2188
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:34,330
What's wrong with just Tom pump,
sweetie?

2189
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:35,920
Come on.
Can we just get along?

2190
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,960
You are a big sweetie.
Come here.

2191
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:38,823
How much time?
I would much rather live in a world 

2192
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:43,384
where you go with your grandfather and 
get a little kid a little bread and you 

2193
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:50,440
come back home and they yell at each 
other and you make a meal.

2194
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:53,380
You know what I mean?
Like why are we spending all this time?

2195
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:54,243
Because I mean there's people that need 
to spend the time to move the culture 

2196
01:41:56,651 --> 01:41:59,110
and do things and protect themselves.
That's not what this is.

2197
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,090
This is people trying to get attention 
for their work.

2198
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:02,343
They're trying to get attention for 
their click baity little articles and 

2199
01:42:04,181 --> 01:42:08,620
click baity little things,
little campaigns against people.

2200
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:09,670
That's what it is.
I mean,

2201
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:10,504
people love that shit.
All I would've had to do with this book 

2202
01:42:12,821 --> 01:42:13,730
is,
is right.

2203
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:17,390
Something about trump in it and that 
people could sound bite.

2204
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:18,323
Right?
Right.

2205
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,410
And I ended up and have a lot of people 
be like,

2206
01:42:20,411 --> 01:42:22,210
what is and get everybody talking about 
it,

2207
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,620
right?
That's what they're doing.

2208
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:24,483
They're trying to make up make noise.
So people look at them and they make 

2209
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:29,050
more money.
Well,

2210
01:42:29,051 --> 01:42:32,410
and then there's also mean there has to 
be a thought behind it like that.

2211
01:42:32,411 --> 01:42:34,660
Men have done some horrible,
shitty things.

2212
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:35,853
So the.
But the idea of why can't you 

2213
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:37,504
generalize?
Of course.

2214
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:38,373
Well,
you can't generalize because you're a 

2215
01:42:38,801 --> 01:42:40,310
nuanced human being,
right?

2216
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:44,980
You're supposed to be able to understand
full well every one is different.

2217
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:46,910
Literally every,
every sing,

2218
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,793
there's hundred and 50 million men.
The idea of why can't you hate all of 

2219
01:42:51,191 --> 01:42:52,024
them while you can if you want to,
but it's a ridiculous way to live your 

2220
01:42:55,751 --> 01:42:56,584
life.
No,

2221
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:58,300
exactly.
Exactly.

2222
01:42:58,301 --> 01:42:59,134
So you means if you are,
you are you straight and you were 

2223
01:43:02,381 --> 01:43:03,214
attracted to men and you have to hate 
them all in quarantine yourself away 

2224
01:43:05,441 --> 01:43:06,750
from just a lot of those guys,
right?

2225
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:08,680
There's a lot of really good people out 
there.

2226
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:11,980
It's father's Day.
How often does that have to happen with,

2227
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:15,370
with people who are homophobic,
who hate gay people,

2228
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:18,730
rally against gay marriage and rally 
against gay rights,

2229
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,560
and then you find out that they're 
really gay.

2230
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:21,483
Yes.
Oh my.

2231
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,870
All the time.
All the time.

2232
01:43:22,871 --> 01:43:24,320
All the time.
Almost every.

2233
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:26,730
Everyone per religious guy.
Yeah.

2234
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:30,790
It was anti gay.
Some scandal always comes out.

2235
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:33,590
Oh,
he was sleeping with theirs.

2236
01:43:33,690 --> 01:43:35,440
So common.
It's cliche.

2237
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:36,460
Yeah.
Right,

2238
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:38,210
exactly.
It's that many of them.

2239
01:43:38,211 --> 01:43:39,044
Look for it.
When someone talks about gay is a sin 

2240
01:43:41,681 --> 01:43:42,514
against men and yeah,
we should lock them up and we should do 

2241
01:43:44,501 --> 01:43:45,390
this from.
Oh,

2242
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,070
someone sucking Dick on the sneak dip.
Right?

2243
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,260
Let's follow that dude around them 
behind.

2244
01:43:50,690 --> 01:43:52,040
We're going to find this on.
We're

2245
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,550
going to find it.
Yeah,

2246
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:54,740
I'll find it.
I mean,

2247
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:56,300
that's that.
That is what people do.

2248
01:43:56,630 --> 01:44:00,620
I think what I like about what you're 
saying and how I feel too,

2249
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:02,450
is that we need to be nice to each 
other.

2250
01:44:02,690 --> 01:44:03,523
We this,
this whole idea of this gotcha bullshit 

2251
01:44:05,931 --> 01:44:06,764
and this attacking people for things 
that don't necessarily make sense 

2252
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:11,480
without,
without nuance,

2253
01:44:11,481 --> 01:44:15,260
without the understanding of complexity 
of human interaction,

2254
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:18,890
with no concern for that at all because 
you just want to target,

2255
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:19,780
you know,
I mean,

2256
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:20,613
we have to shun that stuff.
That stuff is just pure foolishness and 

2257
01:44:25,161 --> 01:44:28,490
it's bad for discourse.
It's bad for community.

2258
01:44:28,491 --> 01:44:30,200
It's bad for the way we communicate with
each other,

2259
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:33,440
generates more hate and it's,
it's also a generalization,

2260
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:36,380
a gross generalization,
which is just the same thing as sexism.

2261
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:38,390
It's the same thing as racism.
It's the same.

2262
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:39,253
It's the same thing.

2263
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:42,730
Why can't we hate men as a gross 
generalization like that state.

2264
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:45,110
I don't know what the article said,
but that statement,

2265
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:48,350
that's a gross general.
You can't because you're a nice person.

2266
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,850
I assume you're a nice person.
Yeah,

2267
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,010
because we don't hate.
How about that?

2268
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:55,310
How about we try not to hate him.
You Hate Justin Trudeau.

2269
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:57,860
That kind of seems like a sweater,
I seems awesome.

2270
01:44:57,861 --> 01:44:59,330
Yeah.
Trump trump week.

2271
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:01,310
Yeah,
and an amazing suit.

2272
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:04,520
He's trump called a week and dishonesty.
Yeah.

2273
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:06,050
No,
I mean,

2274
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,340
you know,
the culture has enough hate it.

2275
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:12,060
I think the campaign has to be for more 
kindness over that.

2276
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:12,933
That's a great picture of him sitting 
there with his arms crossed and they're 

2277
01:45:17,121 --> 01:45:19,820
all leaning on the table,
listen to us.

2278
01:45:19,821 --> 01:45:22,550
Just listen to angry.
It was like,

2279
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:23,570
no,
no.

2280
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:25,400
I wonder what they're talking about 
right there.

2281
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:26,720
Like,
should we go to lunch?

2282
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:31,880
I like Spaghetti,
but we don't have Spaghetti Donald.

2283
01:45:31,881 --> 01:45:32,714
We don't have spaghetti.
Spaghetti like some fucking spaghetti 

2284
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:36,463
could.
Someone gets spaghetti making me a 

2285
01:45:37,521 --> 01:45:38,354
fucking pizza.
Can't you just get what everybody else 

2286
01:45:40,161 --> 01:45:43,600
gets a wonder what they were talking 
about that.

2287
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:46,460
That is a great picture though.
That's great.

2288
01:45:46,461 --> 01:45:48,320
With him being the only one sitting 
down,

2289
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:52,400
arms crossed books so spoiled and her,
the look on her face,

2290
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:53,810
she's like,
oh,

2291
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:55,970
is that the woman from Germany?
Merkel.

2292
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,313
She's got her own.
I have to deal with this on the table 

2293
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:03,510
and anger.
Anger fist.

2294
01:46:04,330 --> 01:46:05,163
Yeah.
What are you doing for Fathers Day with 

2295
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,670
nothing.
Nothing.

2296
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:09,710
Nothing.
Just kinda hanging out.

2297
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:11,480
Everyday is father's day.
It's true.

2298
01:46:11,530 --> 01:46:12,260
Yeah.
I don't want to.

2299
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:15,410
I don't want any special treatment.
I don't celebrate my birthday,

2300
01:46:15,930 --> 01:46:18,350
I don't want anybody to give me 
Christmas presents.

2301
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:21,200
Do that anyway.
Of course,

2302
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:23,120
but I don't.
I'm the same way.

2303
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:27,290
Dad is just supposed to be there.
I like having them around.

2304
01:46:27,570 --> 01:46:29,450
I always tell them I want to see your 
faces.

2305
01:46:29,451 --> 01:46:31,310
That's all I want.
I got all the gifts.

2306
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:33,410
I got all the love.
I got everything I get.

2307
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:35,990
If I get hugs every day,
I'm more than happy.

2308
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:36,873
Totally.
I don't want like some fucking cake or 

2309
01:46:38,841 --> 01:46:40,940
some stupid shit.
Brunch.

2310
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,960
There's no father's day.
My Day.

2311
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:48,320
There's no father's Day brunch.
There's no like,

2312
01:46:48,321 --> 01:46:49,980
you know,
having to race through the mall and

2313
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,440
get flowers for father's day.
There was just let us be and be around

2314
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,860
from some woman heckled in Chicago.
There was,

2315
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:02,120
as I was talking about,
is actually,

2316
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:02,983
it's a pro woman piece.
It's a piece about how we forget that 

2317
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:09,253
women make all the human beings and so 
this idea that women are supposed to do 

2318
01:47:13,131 --> 01:47:13,964
everything that men do.
Plus they also make all the fucking 

2319
01:47:16,791 --> 01:47:18,590
human beings.
So I.

2320
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:19,803
it's a lot.
It's this complex or twisty road that I 

2321
01:47:22,521 --> 01:47:23,354
take people down with this.
There's a lot of like misdirection and 

2322
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:29,163
in any way I say it and then later on 
I'm talking about something else and 

2323
01:47:34,671 --> 01:47:39,350
this girl yells out,
we make other people and I'm like,

2324
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:42,230
I just said that.
I said that five minutes ago.

2325
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,430
I go,
I go,

2326
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:46,400
that bitch is one of those chicks that 
celebrates her birthday all month

2327
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:50,110
and everybody went crazy,
but it's like,

2328
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:54,220
that's what I don't want to be.
I don't want to be the person that wants

2329
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:56,070
the attention.
Like,

2330
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,720
this is my father's day.
Father's Day,

2331
01:47:58,810 --> 01:48:00,670
week,
the whole month.

2332
01:48:00,671 --> 01:48:02,770
His father's month.
Finally we're getting.

2333
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:04,390
No,
no,

2334
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,550
we got it easy.
I'm the same way.

2335
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,040
It's that easy.
Yeah,

2336
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:10,330
just I just want them around in the 
house.

2337
01:48:10,331 --> 01:48:13,670
Let me see.
Your face is the reward is not a hard or

2338
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:14,513
a cake.
The reward is actually in being a 

2339
01:48:16,271 --> 01:48:17,740
father.
It's the greatest thing ever.

2340
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:18,633
Yeah.
Just hold my hand for a minute just to 

2341
01:48:19,931 --> 01:48:21,000
come up and just be like,
yeah,

2342
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:25,520
hug me a little squeeze and we're good.
And I think they like that too.

2343
01:48:25,570 --> 01:48:26,403
Like I don't want dads don't want you 
running through the mall trying to find 

2344
01:48:30,161 --> 01:48:32,710
stuff for us and also dads by 
everything.

2345
01:48:32,711 --> 01:48:33,544
Anyway,

2346
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:36,480
dude,
I went to the King Tut exhibit.

2347
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:37,710
Oh yeah.
Downtown.

2348
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:39,750
Amazing.
Oh yeah.

2349
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:44,370
Crazy.
They have things there from 3000,

2350
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,400
300 years ago.
Wow.

2351
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:52,780
They constructed them 3000 years ago.
They have jewelry and these,

2352
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:58,680
these wooden boats that they found in 
King Tut's temple or his tomb.

2353
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,353
The.
Yeah.

2354
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:01,920
And they um,
wow.

2355
01:49:01,921 --> 01:49:03,840
That's,
that's a bow and Arrow that they add.

2356
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:06,780
Here's how stupid they are though.
Whoever put that thing together,

2357
01:49:06,781 --> 01:49:08,640
it says compound bow.
Hey,

2358
01:49:08,641 --> 01:49:12,440
you fucks you museum fucks.
That's not a compound bow.

2359
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:14,280
Hey.
It's just not.

2360
01:49:14,281 --> 01:49:16,380
It's a traditional bow.
You asshole.

2361
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:21,330
A compound bow has cams on it and it 
works on a totally different system.

2362
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:22,383
The fact that you fucking people are 
running a goddamn museum and you don't 

2363
01:49:25,651 --> 01:49:28,650
know what a compound bow is really 
pisses me off right now.

2364
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:31,190
There's a Guy Mr.
Rocha connected.

2365
01:49:31,191 --> 01:49:32,024
We just thought it with a bow and arrow.
I took a photo of it and I took a photo 

2366
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:36,990
of what it says,
what it says there,

2367
01:49:36,991 --> 01:49:37,824
because I was like legitimately angry.
I was reading this thing where it says 

2368
01:49:40,681 --> 01:49:43,170
compound bow.
Here it says is what it says.

2369
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:47,710
It says gilded wood in compound bow

2370
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,910
with glass and calcite inlay.
It's not a cop.

2371
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:53,440
Well Jim,
if.

2372
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,550
Oh,
can we did.

2373
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,680
We just thought it with a bow and arrow.
Ceremonial Boa Account.

2374
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:02,200
Compound bow with one of those bose that
I have in the back there.

2375
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:03,010
There,
there.

2376
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:06,730
This is.
This is a very new modern creation.

2377
01:50:06,731 --> 01:50:11,731
You can fuck heads in this big Egyptian 
thing with comedy or like I got angry,

2378
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:15,130
obsessed with the bow and arrow.
Well,

2379
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,860
I do get obsessed with it because a lot 
to you,

2380
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,450
but yeah,
and it makes me angry.

2381
01:50:19,451 --> 01:50:22,690
Wearing an archery shirt right now.
Nobody has archery shirts.

2382
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:27,120
Nobody wears archery practice everyday.
To me,

2383
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:30,530
I'm a person who's just like,
if I was looking at a,

2384
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:34,120
a Jujitsu diagram and they said this is 
a Kung Fu,

2385
01:50:34,121 --> 01:50:34,631
I'd be like,
Hey,

2386
01:50:34,631 --> 01:50:36,610
you fuck yeah,
this is important.

2387
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:39,220
This is Brazilian Jujitsu.
Go back to that.

2388
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,760
Yeah,
that's why I love boomerang boomerangs.

2389
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:43,690
The boomerangs,
the shape of them,

2390
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:48,720
they were not designed to come back.
It's interesting like I wonder like when

2391
01:50:48,731 --> 01:50:52,120
they figured out that was designed to.
As a weapon.

2392
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:56,350
Yeah,
but just not enough of a curve for it to

2393
01:50:56,351 --> 01:50:57,184
return to the thrower.
So it was just means a hit somebody a 

2394
01:50:59,950 --> 01:51:00,783
hundred yards away.
It just a good way to throw something 

2395
01:51:03,041 --> 01:51:04,630
and hit it.
I love boomerangs.

2396
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:06,220
They're pretty dope.
How they're cool.

2397
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:07,450
It's cool design.
Oh,

2398
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:08,373
I would go find open fields and you 
don't catch it like it doesn't come 

2399
01:51:12,161 --> 01:51:12,994
right back.
It comes back and like sales slowly 

2400
01:51:14,561 --> 01:51:16,210
down,
like in a spiral at the end.

2401
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:17,373
You know what's fucked up though about 
this a tent King Tut exhibit is you 

2402
01:51:20,081 --> 01:51:24,240
really got the sense that he was an 
inbred first law.

2403
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:28,000
Really.
His of his head was all fucked up and he

2404
01:51:28,001 --> 01:51:30,130
had a club foot like he was in.

2405
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:34,470
He had two children that were all 
mummified with him that were stillborn,

2406
01:51:35,290 --> 01:51:37,630
so.
And he married his sister.

2407
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:38,771
He,
he,

2408
01:51:38,771 --> 01:51:39,604
his father had a baby with someone else.
And then he married his half sister 

2409
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:48,580
who's banging his half sister.
What they did,

2410
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:49,463
they,
they,

2411
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:52,480
they were constantly inbreeding in the 
royal families.

2412
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:56,740
Try to keep the bloodline pure and to 
try to keep all the money in the family.

2413
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:58,860
Yeah,
that's true.

2414
01:51:59,110 --> 01:52:01,110
Did you ever see his head?
What is headed plank?

2415
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:05,320
Jamie?
Pull up a photo of King Tucking.

2416
01:52:05,321 --> 01:52:06,154
Ted's been head skull.
He had this weird shaped deformed skull 

2417
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:14,110
and a club foot and all the depictions 
of his body.

2418
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,310
Yeah,
because it's a weird head.

2419
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:20,710
Like look how big his head stuck up in 
the back.

2420
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:21,863
Oh,
we're.

2421
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:25,240
He was essentially inbred like there was
something wrong with him.

2422
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:28,270
Was he a good king?
Was only around for a little while.

2423
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:31,840
He was just because we found his stuff.
I mean,

2424
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:35,410
it's not like he had that much global 
impact or did he?

2425
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:37,120
That's a good question.
I'm not,

2426
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:39,990
I'm not sure,
but it's got a weird little stories.

2427
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,550
Amazing of how they found it and the,
the exhibit.

2428
01:52:42,551 --> 01:52:45,750
They have this imax movie that goes 
along with the exhibit a

2429
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:49,070
fucking bad ass because the imax screen 
is gigantic.

2430
01:52:49,071 --> 01:52:50,330
Right?
So when you're there,

2431
01:52:50,331 --> 01:52:54,170
you get a real sense of how big these 
structures actually are.

2432
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,033
Right?
But they were looking for it for five 

2433
01:52:57,081 --> 01:52:58,790
years.
This guy,

2434
01:52:58,810 --> 01:53:03,810
this British guy,
and this kid named Hussein who was the,

2435
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:04,821
uh,
like,

2436
01:53:04,821 --> 01:53:07,250
uh,
he would get water for all the workers.

2437
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:08,413
He was clearing,
like he had these water pots and they 

2438
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:11,533
set them into the ground so that people 
could come scoop water while they're 

2439
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,710
digging and trying to find these.
Yeah,

2440
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:18,130
well they're trying to find this tomb.
And uh,

2441
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:22,910
he found a step.
He put the water bottle down,

2442
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:24,043
he cleared some dirt away and he found 
this flat rock just randomly flat rock 

2443
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:31,550
was the steel.
This one of the stairs that lead down to

2444
01:53:31,551 --> 01:53:32,384
the tomb.
And it was the only time that they ever 

2445
01:53:33,621 --> 01:53:37,730
found that was completely untouched.

2446
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:38,983
Really?
Yeah.

2447
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:41,090
Yeah.
That is grave robbers.

2448
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:43,460
Yeah.
Grave robbers had found every other tomb

2449
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:44,420
because they,
oh really?

2450
01:53:44,421 --> 01:53:47,450
They've tombs were miles away from the 
pyramids because,

2451
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,363
I mean,
they probably had tombs in the pyramids 

2452
01:53:50,781 --> 01:53:53,180
that were rated.
And then they realize after a while,

2453
01:53:53,181 --> 01:53:54,560
a quick,
we've got to hide these things.

2454
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:55,693
So they took them way far out,
miles and miles away and they put them 

2455
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:03,920
in these hillsides and they put them.
Thieves found them there too.

2456
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:05,090
She.
So when.

2457
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:09,710
So it was that one like underground.
Did they build it that way or over time?

2458
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:10,821
No,
it was underground.

2459
01:54:10,821 --> 01:54:13,400
It wasn't again.
That's crazy.

2460
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,370
It's amazing.
Cool way to discover some.

2461
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:16,253
Yeah.
One kid and he was the first one in the 

2462
01:54:18,441 --> 01:54:21,290
tomb to because he was tiny.
So when they busted the whole,

2463
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:22,393
they busted a hole through the wall and 
he climbed in with a light around and 

2464
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:27,620
you see anything down there,
billy?

2465
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:28,693
Well yeah,
that's part of the film is the 

2466
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,123
archeologists like looking through the 
hole and seeing like the goals and all 

2467
01:54:34,791 --> 01:54:38,600
this stuff.
First chip through the whole God.

2468
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,990
Thousands and thousands of years 
completely untouched.

2469
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:43,700
Amazing.
It's amazing.

2470
01:54:43,701 --> 01:54:44,534
And then you've take that one thing and 
a big giant rock ball starts rolling 

2471
01:54:47,391 --> 01:54:52,100
after you like Indiana Jones.
It was a remarkable moment.

2472
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:54,920
Is really interesting because like they 
had like a glove,

2473
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:58,730
a linen glove that was 3000 years old.
Really?

2474
01:54:58,731 --> 01:55:01,730
And you're looking at this linen glove,
that sandals,

2475
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:06,080
they had the sarcophagus and sandals,
like he had like these sort of,

2476
01:55:06,081 --> 01:55:07,490
um,
you know,

2477
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:08,353
decorative sandals.
So how long were they making that stuff 

2478
01:55:10,351 --> 01:55:12,260
even been before then,
if that's 3000 years,

2479
01:55:12,261 --> 01:55:14,120
thousands of years.
So even before that,

2480
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:15,433
I had a guy recently Dr Robert Schoch 
from Boston University and he's a 

2481
01:55:19,761 --> 01:55:20,594
geologist and he is one of the,
he's one of the first people to propose 

2482
01:55:25,311 --> 01:55:26,610
the idea,
like one of the first,

2483
01:55:26,611 --> 01:55:30,440
like real scholars to propose the idea 
that the sphinx is far,

2484
01:55:30,441 --> 01:55:35,441
far older than people think it is and 
that it's not from 2,500

2485
01:55:35,481 --> 01:55:37,820
BC,
but it's from way before that,

2486
01:55:37,821 --> 01:55:38,654
perhaps maybe 10,000
years old in that because it has water 

2487
01:55:41,271 --> 01:55:41,810
erosion.

2488
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:45,570
All of it can only have come from 
thousands of years of rainfall.

2489
01:55:46,870 --> 01:55:47,730
Yeah,
dude,

2490
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:49,760
it's crazy.
So what's the implication of that?

2491
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:52,550
The implication is that his,
he,

2492
01:55:52,551 --> 01:55:53,384
his take on it,
which is really interesting and he 

2493
01:55:56,210 --> 01:55:58,100
really scared the shit out of me and 
blew my mind.

2494
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,570
Um,
mass coronal inject a ejections.

2495
01:56:02,630 --> 01:56:03,463
So something from the sun,
some gigantic solar flare that created 

2496
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:09,253
unbelievable havoc on earth.
He was talking about lightning storms 

2497
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:16,303
that were like the lightning coming down
like sheets of rain in a hurricane and 

2498
01:56:21,531 --> 01:56:22,364
that it just covered parts of the earth,
lightning and killed everything and 

2499
01:56:27,381 --> 01:56:32,280
killed off mass.
Just mass numbers of human beings.

2500
01:56:32,290 --> 01:56:34,710
Large mammals.
It's responsible for.

2501
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:35,693
There's a,
there's a big mass extinction that we 

2502
01:56:37,201 --> 01:56:42,201
really don't understand what caused 
somewhere in that range of around 10,000

2503
01:56:42,391 --> 01:56:43,224
years ago.
And he attributes that to this mass 

2504
01:56:45,301 --> 01:56:48,750
coronal objection and that this,
this huge sun,

2505
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:49,823
this burst of energy from the Sun caused
these unbelievable chaotic storms that 

2506
01:56:55,981 --> 01:56:56,814
killed.

2507
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:58,310
Who knows,
count he.

2508
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,470
I said,
so is it like,

2509
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:02,700
like a thunderstorm times 100.
He's like,

2510
01:57:02,701 --> 01:57:03,534
no times a million.
He was like sheets and a million sheets 

2511
01:57:07,591 --> 01:57:10,710
of lightning coming down like rain in a 
hurricane.

2512
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,760
Oh my goodness.
Imagine lightning just cooking the earth

2513
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:19,140
for a long period of time or just one 
big storm long period of time.

2514
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:19,993
Like still sun just kept people that 
studied living in caves and they built 

2515
01:57:23,161 --> 01:57:26,790
these dwellings inside the earth because
that was where they can survive,

2516
01:57:26,791 --> 01:57:29,310
they can survive where the radiation 
wasn't coming down,

2517
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:31,230
it wasn't going through the earth to get
to them.

2518
01:57:31,590 --> 01:57:33,390
So houses,
tents,

2519
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:34,463
and I think that you lived in that was 
outside that those people were dead 

2520
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:40,410
because the only people that live or the
people that lived there had their houses

2521
01:57:40,411 --> 01:57:42,780
carved into hillsides.
Is there evidence of this?

2522
01:57:42,781 --> 01:57:43,250
Yeah,
yeah,

2523
01:57:43,250 --> 01:57:44,083
yeah.
Evidence,

2524
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:47,250
geological evidence.
Which was it a mainstream thing or is it

2525
01:57:47,251 --> 01:57:50,340
his kind of wells?
He kind of knows that that's possible as

2526
01:57:50,341 --> 01:57:51,174
mainstream.
Whether or not it happened then is up 

2527
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:54,114
for debate.
It's also the end of the ice age and he 

2528
01:57:55,681 --> 01:57:59,670
thinks that's the reason why the,
the all these ice caps melted.

2529
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:01,043
This was what caused that.
It was part of that has a massive shift 

2530
01:58:03,121 --> 01:58:05,930
in the massive shift in the,
uh,

2531
01:58:05,950 --> 01:58:07,110
the global temperature.

2532
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:08,490
She's.
Yeah,

2533
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:09,353
it's crazy.
I was just reading a thing about the 

2534
01:58:10,261 --> 01:58:12,370
message yesterday and the Times that,
uh,

2535
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:16,670
about how the Ice Change Manhattan,
all the five boroughs,

2536
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:19,310
like that's kind of where the ice kind 
of came down to,

2537
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:23,760
was around there and seeing how receded 
and what it left behind we were,

2538
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:27,830
but the civilizations weren't really 
living around them.

2539
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:29,930
Right.
What do you mean during the Ice Age?

2540
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:31,310
Of course there were,
they were,

2541
01:58:31,430 --> 01:58:32,840
well,
there were some civilizations.

2542
01:58:32,841 --> 01:58:33,674
I mean there's established civilizations
like there's some stricter Africa or 

2543
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:37,333
while there's some structures that are,
that have been absolutely linked to 

2544
01:58:40,611 --> 01:58:43,780
that.
A big one is go beckley tap eight,

2545
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:47,950
which is in Turkey and they have,
they've absolutely dated that to 12,000

2546
01:58:47,951 --> 01:58:50,590
years ago.
So what's fascinating about that is they

2547
01:58:50,591 --> 01:58:53,920
didn't know that people are capable of 
building these gigantic stone structures

2548
01:58:53,921 --> 01:58:54,754
12,000
years ago and they've only uncovered a 

2549
01:58:56,321 --> 01:58:58,230
very small amount of gold beckley 
tapping.

2550
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,830
It's a huge,
huge site.

2551
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:01,023
So do you think that there's still tons 
of stuff we could discover that hasn't 

2552
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:06,340
been tapped yet?
Like under the oceans or.

2553
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:07,270
Yeah,
for sure.

2554
01:59:08,170 --> 01:59:09,280
Well,
if people find it,

2555
01:59:09,281 --> 01:59:11,740
if these guys are right,
and here's the thing,

2556
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:16,900
they what they think is that there's 
been,

2557
01:59:16,930 --> 01:59:21,930
there was a big dip and I forget what 
his term that he used to describe it,

2558
01:59:23,291 --> 01:59:25,210
but it was the.

2559
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:27,333
There was a dark age that was created by
these mass ejections and that 

2560
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:33,243
civilization particularly in Egypt had 
reached a very high level of 

2561
01:59:36,581 --> 01:59:40,420
sophistication when they are capable of 
building these gigantic stone structures

2562
01:59:40,421 --> 01:59:41,254
and they had all this amazing 
architecture and engineering or to move 

2563
01:59:45,431 --> 01:59:46,264
these huge stones and then there was a 
big die off and that for thousands of 

2564
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:52,773
years people essentially were knocked 
back almost down into the stone age and 

2565
01:59:56,481 --> 02:00:00,550
then regrouped and this is but this 
cataclysmic story.

2566
02:00:00,551 --> 02:00:04,720
This story is in Noah's Ark.
It's in the epic of Gilgamesh,

2567
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:05,673
which is,
which is where I rack is like they all 

2568
02:00:08,231 --> 02:00:09,064
talk about the floods and cash in is 
chaos and God punished everyone and 

2569
02:00:13,781 --> 02:00:16,570
everyone died.
This is like a part of human history,

2570
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:18,910
many different versions of of like,
right.

2571
02:00:18,970 --> 02:00:20,620
What exactly happened?
Yeah,

2572
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:22,960
but he's pointing to geological 
evidence,

2573
02:00:22,961 --> 02:00:24,970
which is fascinating because at one 
point in time,

2574
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:26,920
nine around 9,000
BC,

2575
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:32,200
the Nile Valley was not all sand the way
we see it now,

2576
02:00:32,201 --> 02:00:36,730
but it was a tropical rain forest and so
for thousands of years before that,

2577
02:00:36,731 --> 02:00:37,564
it was torrential downpours and rain and
all this was the reason why the Sphinx 

2578
02:00:43,001 --> 02:00:43,834
enclosure has these deep fissures that 
are indicative of rainfall and water 

2579
02:00:48,161 --> 02:00:49,930
erosion for thousands of years.

2580
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:53,050
Not just instantaneous flooding from 
some giant event,

2581
02:00:53,051 --> 02:00:55,690
but from thousands of years of rainfall,
of rain,

2582
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:00,580
just constant rate.
And so that would predate the.

2583
02:01:00,610 --> 02:01:01,443
The idea is the current established 
timeline is that the great sphinx was 

2584
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:07,923
created somewhere around the time that 
they believe the great pyramids were 

2585
02:01:10,301 --> 02:01:12,060
created.
Now the Great Pyramid of they've,

2586
02:01:12,061 --> 02:01:12,894
um,
they've,

2587
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:17,260
they've done carbon dating that 
indicates that that was somewhere around

2588
02:01:17,261 --> 02:01:19,120
2,500
BC.

2589
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:24,190
He thinks that that was built over an 
older site that was for many,

2590
02:01:24,191 --> 02:01:26,290
many years before that.
And he has all these photos,

2591
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:27,533
similar construction methods that 
they've done where they've taken a 

2592
02:01:30,131 --> 02:01:30,964
really old site from maybe many,
many thousands of years ago and put 

2593
02:01:34,391 --> 02:01:37,810
something over that like sort of like 
the analysts did build on top.

2594
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:40,230
Yeah.
But the Parthenon Necropolis,

2595
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:41,413
they built it over the Acropolis or an 
old thing that they don't even know 

2596
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:49,100
where the fuck it came from.
Where that old thing where it's from.

2597
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:50,173
So the idea is that this old thing in 
Egypt in particular is a product of an 

2598
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:56,870
old civilization from many,
many,

2599
02:01:56,871 --> 02:01:57,704
many thousands of years ago.
So long ago that the distance and the 

2600
02:02:01,701 --> 02:02:02,534
gap between the people who built the 
pyramids and the people who originally 

2601
02:02:05,871 --> 02:02:10,580
built the Sphinx is far greater,
far greater than that.

2602
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:13,220
Our distance between us and the people 
who built the pyramids.

2603
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:14,290
Oh really?
Yeah,

2604
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:16,640
man.
That's amazing.

2605
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:19,370
This is how fucking crazy it is.
It's about this.

2606
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:20,263
Cleopatra is coach.
She's closer to the creation of the 

2607
02:02:24,411 --> 02:02:27,320
iphone than she is to the creation of 
the pyramids.

2608
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:30,070
That's the real deal.
That means that yes,

2609
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:33,110
that's established egyptologists 
archeologists.

2610
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:34,660
This is not controversial.
Yeah.

2611
02:02:34,830 --> 02:02:37,210
This is just a fact.
She then they cool,

2612
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:38,443
but they think that at 2,500
BC that represents only the new 

2613
02:02:41,901 --> 02:02:45,980
construction in Egypt and that before 
that if you go to 10,000

2614
02:02:45,981 --> 02:02:48,830
BC and before there was a whole nother 
civilization there.

2615
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:50,480
She's,
that's amazing.

2616
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:51,231
Yeah,
it's amazing.

2617
02:02:51,231 --> 02:02:53,720
And that this is when 10,000
plus years ago,

2618
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:58,460
this is when these cataclysmic events 
happen and all these people died off and

2619
02:02:58,490 --> 02:03:02,420
much of what they knew back then was 
lost and they rebuild.

2620
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:06,250
What's so scary about that is that,
uh,

2621
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:07,633
it sounds like it could happen any day.
Something can happen with the sun and 

2622
02:03:11,211 --> 02:03:12,044
all of a sudden we're dealing with some 
other big solar flare comes at us and 

2623
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,170
we're in trouble.
What did it say,

2624
02:03:18,171 --> 02:03:20,930
Janet?
There was an article in business insider

2625
02:03:20,931 --> 02:03:24,380
about coronal mass ejections hots 
coronal mean.

2626
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:26,660
Go back to that is a different thing 
though,

2627
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,281
coronal.
Sounds like.

2628
02:03:28,281 --> 02:03:28,670
Yeah.

2629
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:30,800
What did you just say?
High speed solar winds.

2630
02:03:30,801 --> 02:03:32,860
Increase lightening strikes on earth.
Yeah.

2631
02:03:32,861 --> 02:03:34,270
But what,
what was that last one though?

2632
02:03:34,570 --> 02:03:35,860
Coronal mass ejection.
Was it,

2633
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:36,400
you have to

2634
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:37,680
scribe or something?
It was,

2635
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:40,210
I had it up for five minutes.
It was all red,

2636
02:03:40,211 --> 02:03:43,150
but it was saying that like they could 
put it in that article.

2637
02:03:44,050 --> 02:03:46,330
Come.
Let me go back to it.

2638
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:48,160
What do you mean?
What's it doing?

2639
02:03:48,250 --> 02:03:49,540
It's not.
It's acting weird.

2640
02:03:49,541 --> 02:03:50,800
I gotta find it.
It's King Tut.

2641
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:54,460
This is what happened with Indiana Jones
and then he can't go back.

2642
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:55,323
Why isn't it

2643
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:59,330
there were shockingly unprepared for an 
extreme.

2644
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:00,500
Oh,
oh,

2645
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:01,343
looks like you're using an ad blocker.
Just dissembled the ad blogger business 

2646
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:06,200
insiders.
Here it goes.

2647
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:07,303
We're shockingly unprepared for an 
extreme weather event that could fry 

2648
02:04:10,431 --> 02:04:11,690
earth power grid.
Now.

2649
02:04:11,691 --> 02:04:13,670
That's something that.
What did he say had happened?

2650
02:04:13,730 --> 02:04:16,100
What year did he say he don't want that 
to happen.

2651
02:04:16,101 --> 02:04:18,680
Carrington event was 18,
59 in 18.

2652
02:04:18,681 --> 02:04:19,930
50 nine event.
Oh yeah.

2653
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:23,180
If it happened today with completely,
and this is a documented event,

2654
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:24,890
if it hadn't been,
we're like,

2655
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:27,950
transformers blew up all these 
different,

2656
02:04:27,951 --> 02:04:28,784
um,
where they would do the Morse code and 

2657
02:04:29,721 --> 02:04:30,554
Shit,
all that shit express and exploded 

2658
02:04:33,621 --> 02:04:37,200
because of this coronal mass ejection or
gigantic solar flare.

2659
02:04:37,201 --> 02:04:38,670
And this is a documented

2660
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:40,810
one and they're saying if this 
documented one,

2661
02:04:40,811 --> 02:04:44,070
this Carrington event happened today,
we'd be fucked.

2662
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:46,280
All the electric would puke.
Yeah.

2663
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:48,300
We wouldn't have to go on twitter 
anymore.

2664
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:50,280
Yeah,
that would be amazing.

2665
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:51,870
Yeah.
But you will also wouldn't be able to go

2666
02:04:51,871 --> 02:04:55,080
to the grocery store and your Tesla 
wouldn't work.

2667
02:04:55,740 --> 02:05:00,740
But I would get my compound bow and go.
Not that piece of shit in the museum.

2668
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:09,610
That's so crazy that we've.
What's crazy is that you,

2669
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:13,290
these civilizations were able to build 
up and they get knocked all the way back

2670
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:15,570
and then build up a similar way.
Right.

2671
02:05:15,571 --> 02:05:17,430
If,
if you're talking about the Egypt one.

2672
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:18,481
Yeah,
right.

2673
02:05:18,481 --> 02:05:19,314
They came back kind of in a similar way.
If the Pyramids and the Sphinx are that 

2674
02:05:22,231 --> 02:05:23,064
far apart,
that there was something in the DNA in 

2675
02:05:26,471 --> 02:05:30,600
the,
in the brain space that was that evolve.

2676
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:33,480
They tried to come back the same way.
Was pretty interesting,

2677
02:05:33,810 --> 02:05:36,660
if not the same way in.
In a similar way.

2678
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:39,000
Yeah.
I mean some of the people survived.

2679
02:05:39,001 --> 02:05:39,834
Right.
And some of the people that survived 

2680
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:42,780
must've had some knowledge of the 
construction.

2681
02:05:42,781 --> 02:05:44,880
They pass it down from generation to 
generation,

2682
02:05:44,881 --> 02:05:45,714
but you know,
you're dealing with thousands and 

2683
02:05:47,670 --> 02:05:48,503
thousands of years where they weren't 
building things like that and then they 

2684
02:05:50,490 --> 02:05:52,440
figured out a way to do it again.
Yeah,

2685
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:54,730
it's interesting.
How the fuck did they be?

2686
02:05:54,731 --> 02:05:55,564
So how did they become so smart?
That's what's interesting because the 

2687
02:05:58,231 --> 02:06:02,970
great paramedics per perhaps maybe they 
just had superior genetics,

2688
02:06:02,971 --> 02:06:07,530
but it's also what they were showing in 
this video that I watched it in the imax

2689
02:06:07,531 --> 02:06:08,364
thing yesterday,
was that the area was so unbelievably 

2690
02:06:10,801 --> 02:06:11,634
fertile that there was so much of an 
opportunity for them to grow food and 

2691
02:06:15,661 --> 02:06:19,650
there were so many animals there for 
them to hunt and agriculture,

2692
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:20,783
that they had a chance to sort of 
establish a civilization because it was 

2693
02:06:24,211 --> 02:06:25,044
such a rich area with natural resources 
and established civilization and that 

2694
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:29,514
civilization just kept advancing and 
moving forward and that it was all 

2695
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:34,950
eventually weakened by civil turmoil.

2696
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,293
That civil turmoil in the Pharaoh's lost
their power and as the Pharaoh's lost 

2697
02:06:39,691 --> 02:06:42,640
their power,
then they were invaded and yeah,

2698
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:44,550
from across the sea.
Well,

2699
02:06:44,551 --> 02:06:45,384
no,
from inside of Africa over inside 

2700
02:06:46,711 --> 02:06:48,210
Africa.
If you look at,

2701
02:06:48,211 --> 02:06:48,721
um,
yeah,

2702
02:06:48,721 --> 02:06:51,630
the Nubians took over Egypt at one point
in time,

2703
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:54,900
sense of,
well different,

2704
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:56,280
you know,
different people in Africa.

2705
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:57,143
We're going over there and looking at 
all the shit they had and also the 

2706
02:06:59,011 --> 02:07:01,290
library of Alexandria was burned by the 
Muslims.

2707
02:07:01,291 --> 02:07:04,770
Was it a lush area like when I picked 
your Egypt I picture like a desert.

2708
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:05,773
No,
right.

2709
02:07:07,130 --> 02:07:07,891
Is it?
No.

2710
02:07:07,891 --> 02:07:12,510
Denial was a river right.
And the river where the wetlands,

2711
02:07:12,511 --> 02:07:13,344
where it's filled with the animals and 
they grew food there and what they're 

2712
02:07:16,741 --> 02:07:21,350
thinking by this predating of the Sphinx
with Dr Robert Schoch with his,

2713
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:26,510
his proposal is that it was initially 
created back when it was rain forest and

2714
02:07:27,541 --> 02:07:30,930
was unbelievably lush,
so incredibly fertile and then slowly as

2715
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:31,813
the climate shifted and that climate 
shift could have corresponded with that 

2716
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:37,590
coronal mass ejections.

2717
02:07:37,590 --> 02:07:38,423
So it could have been some sort of a 
massive event that's slowly or even 

2718
02:07:42,251 --> 02:07:46,000
rapidly shifted the climate.
I would like to go over and see it.

2719
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:47,740
I always,
I'm a little scared to go there.

2720
02:07:47,750 --> 02:07:50,050
To me both buddy.
Yeah.

2721
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:51,850
That would be a cool.
I mean,

2722
02:07:51,851 --> 02:07:52,684
where,
what else would you want to see that's 

2723
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:55,870
that profound?
It's when they're walking.

2724
02:07:55,871 --> 02:07:58,030
When you watched the imax movie,
I can't recommend enough.

2725
02:07:58,031 --> 02:08:00,220
It's quick too.
If you have a short attention span,

2726
02:08:00,221 --> 02:08:01,450
it's like 45 minutes.
Right?

2727
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:02,493
But when you watch them walk next to 
these enormous statues mean these 

2728
02:08:08,321 --> 02:08:09,154
fucking statues of the pharaohs are so 
big that you see these little tiny 

2729
02:08:12,431 --> 02:08:15,040
people walking by and you realize like,
oh my God,

2730
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:16,173
look at this.
These people had done something 

2731
02:08:18,701 --> 02:08:20,860
unbelievable.
The this,

2732
02:08:20,861 --> 02:08:24,100
the Pyramids and the Sphinx.
There's so much crazy.

2733
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:26,230
There's so much.
And why just.

2734
02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:29,160
They're exactly right.
Exactly.

2735
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:31,210
What did they figure it out?
Yeah.

2736
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:32,620
How did they.
What happened?

2737
02:08:33,690 --> 02:08:35,680
Why were they the only ones at the time?
I mean,

2738
02:08:35,681 --> 02:08:37,540
it has to be connected to resources,
right?

2739
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:38,374
Like because if you go today,
there's parts of the world where people 

2740
02:08:41,351 --> 02:08:42,260
are,
you know,

2741
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:45,580
and some impoverished parts of Africa 
and particularly where they don't have a

2742
02:08:45,581 --> 02:08:47,490
lot of resources or people are fucked,
right?

2743
02:08:47,530 --> 02:08:48,363
And they don't have any opportunity and 
they're in a terrible place and it's 

2744
02:08:50,531 --> 02:08:54,070
just really,
really shitty time to be alive.

2745
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:58,870
You're not advancing at the same time.
You can go to like the bay area,

2746
02:08:59,270 --> 02:09:00,103
some teasing cheese shop and right 
around your electric car and you know 

2747
02:09:03,791 --> 02:09:06,730
what I mean?
Seeing that on earth.

2748
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:08,140
Yeah.
Simultaneously.

2749
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:10,450
Yeah.
It's just purely what's available.

2750
02:09:10,530 --> 02:09:11,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

2751
02:09:11,591 --> 02:09:13,300
Like,
and what minds,

2752
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:16,990
like how many Elan Musk's did they have 
the Egyptian times,

2753
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:17,350
right?

2754
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:18,183
Because it was just us.
You and I were kind of dumb to be 

2755
02:09:21,071 --> 02:09:22,300
honest.
Not that bright.

2756
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:23,193
Yeah.
We're not venting tunnels under the 

2757
02:09:25,511 --> 02:09:27,190
fucking.
Just getting by.

2758
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:30,530
If we smoked a joint and started talking
about this is what we do,

2759
02:09:31,310 --> 02:09:32,143
we make fucking tunnels and then your 
car goes into the tunnel and shoots 

2760
02:09:35,141 --> 02:09:37,630
around that idea.
Fucking crazy,

2761
02:09:37,631 --> 02:09:39,220
bro.
Fucking love that idea.

2762
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:40,263
But nobody would take it seriously and 
nobody would let us dig and then we'd 

2763
02:09:42,221 --> 02:09:44,290
just fall asleep.
Forget about it.

2764
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:46,133
But yeah.
Must have been a bunch of Elon Musk's 

2765
02:09:48,581 --> 02:09:49,870
back in the Egyptian.
Well,

2766
02:09:49,871 --> 02:09:53,020
that's what's amazing is there's this,
there's like this,

2767
02:09:53,190 --> 02:09:57,260
a genius Iq where all the magic happens,
you know,

2768
02:09:57,270 --> 02:09:59,350
like where the Einsteins live,
where the.

2769
02:10:00,570 --> 02:10:01,403
Yeah,
where those big leaps kind of happened 

2770
02:10:03,281 --> 02:10:04,114
and everybody else,
he can be really smart but not to that 

2771
02:10:06,881 --> 02:10:10,810
level where you're actually shifting the
world,

2772
02:10:11,650 --> 02:10:13,060
you know,
and maybe that's what happened.

2773
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:15,310
Maybe there was just one genetic freak 
in me,

2774
02:10:15,311 --> 02:10:18,280
a Egyptian world that was there because 
their diet and stuff,

2775
02:10:18,281 --> 02:10:19,114
they were able to survive and it could 
have been a slow process too because 

2776
02:10:25,061 --> 02:10:25,894
you're dealing with thousands of years 
of prosperity to over thousands of 

2777
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:30,640
years.
They have many,

2778
02:10:30,641 --> 02:10:31,474
many,
many generations to think things 

2779
02:10:32,711 --> 02:10:33,560
through.
I right?

2780
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:37,530
Think about what's happened on this 
continent just over 200 years,

2781
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:39,860
just 200.
Go back 200 years ago.

2782
02:10:39,890 --> 02:10:42,140
Nothing's here.
That's crazy.

2783
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:44,930
It's crazy.
Just 200 years ago.

2784
02:10:45,410 --> 02:10:46,243
Yeah,
I go to where are we going to be like 

2785
02:10:47,950 --> 02:10:51,700
2000,
3000 years ahead here who just here,

2786
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:54,470
especially if you let elon must make is 
tunnels everywhere.

2787
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:55,513
There's going to be so many tunnels,
so anytime you can get to the Grand 

2788
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:02,570
Canyon and 10 minutes,
little pod,

2789
02:11:02,710 --> 02:11:05,110
but that is what is this?
Chandler wasn't 18.

2790
02:11:05,111 --> 02:11:07,010
18 of the United States.
Missouri territory.

2791
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,640
Wow,
that's nuts.

2792
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:12,470
Only 100 years ago.
Look how much they owe.

2793
02:11:12,530 --> 02:11:17,530
How much Spain owned new Spain.
Vice royalty of new Spain is all Texas,

2794
02:11:20,030 --> 02:11:21,950
California.
Arizona.

2795
02:11:21,951 --> 02:11:23,180
Nevada.
Yeah.

2796
02:11:23,210 --> 02:11:26,570
That looks like Montana,
Colorado.

2797
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:31,720
She's looking at Oregon County Oregon 
country.

2798
02:11:32,630 --> 02:11:34,580
Wow.
Shared with United Kingdom.

2799
02:11:34,581 --> 02:11:36,230
The whole north.
The northwest.

2800
02:11:36,231 --> 02:11:40,100
United Kingdom.
Nobody had the country.

2801
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:43,370
Michigan territory.
Missouri territory.

2802
02:11:43,371 --> 02:11:46,310
Michigan was on both sides of the lake.
Look at that.

2803
02:11:47,290 --> 02:11:48,123
Is it?
Yeah,

2804
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:50,480
so Michigan is on the left and the right
of the lake.

2805
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:52,820
You upper peninsula.
Oh,

2806
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:55,190
but not the right side where it says 
Michigan territory.

2807
02:11:55,191 --> 02:11:56,900
That's not Michigan anymore.
That's Michigan.

2808
02:11:56,901 --> 02:11:57,734
The other side is Minneapolis.
Detroit and all that stuff isn't under 

2809
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,360
the upper peninsula up above Wisconsin.
Right,

2810
02:12:02,361 --> 02:12:05,540
but they're not both Michigan.
Right.

2811
02:12:05,541 --> 02:12:07,760
That's Minneapolis right here.
It is up there,

2812
02:12:08,190 --> 02:12:10,760
but where it says Michigan territory,
this Wisconsin.

2813
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:11,840
Right.
That's what I'm saying.

2814
02:12:11,841 --> 02:12:12,290
I'm on my bed.

2815
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:14,570
Sorry.
I said it says it right there.

2816
02:12:14,571 --> 02:12:17,300
It says Michigan on both genders was 
just hit with a solar flare.

2817
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:18,283
He just lost his mind.
Look at is disputed between 

2818
02:12:21,051 --> 02:12:23,390
Massachusetts in the colony of New 
Brunswick.

2819
02:12:23,391 --> 02:12:25,640
You K.
So that's main,

2820
02:12:26,090 --> 02:12:26,923
right?
Because they have Massachusetts 

2821
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:30,640
grabbing,
but Maine was like,

2822
02:12:30,641 --> 02:12:32,190
we're not sure what,
what,

2823
02:12:33,010 --> 02:12:34,820
what?
We might keep it.

2824
02:12:34,821 --> 02:12:38,240
We might not have realized how fucking 
far up their maintenance.

2825
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:40,700
There's a lot of mosquitoes up there 
like Maine,

2826
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:41,773
Massachusetts.
When you look at like where 

2827
02:12:43,251 --> 02:12:45,530
Massachusetts is,
you know,

2828
02:12:45,550 --> 02:12:48,320
and then you go above Massachusetts.
Yeah.

2829
02:12:48,330 --> 02:12:52,640
Mains means big first place that gets 
sun.

2830
02:12:52,670 --> 02:12:55,040
Sunlight in the morning.
Fucking giant man.

2831
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:56,180
Yeah.
Huge.

2832
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:57,980
Right?
And where's New York?

2833
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:59,600
New York,
right down there.

2834
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:02,330
Look at that right next to,
on New York goes.

2835
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:03,883
Yeah.
So look at Massachusetts and 

2836
02:13:05,021 --> 02:13:07,760
Massachusetts was two places.
Look,

2837
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:11,840
it was Massachusetts and it was Maine,
right?

2838
02:13:12,110 --> 02:13:12,730
Look at that.
See?

2839
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:15,040
Because there's two Massachusetts then 
just like there's two Michigan.

2840
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:16,730
Zara.
I'm going to keep all of it.

2841
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:17,960
So this is 18,
18.

2842
02:13:18,160 --> 02:13:20,120
I want all of it.
Is that Ted Kennedy,

2843
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:21,583
Kennedy.

2844
02:13:23,350 --> 02:13:24,620
I'll look at all that.
Man.

2845
02:13:24,650 --> 02:13:26,780
Arabella territory,
Georgia,

2846
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:27,643
South Carolina,
so all those fucked up southern states 

2847
02:13:29,271 --> 02:13:30,104
were still.
They're all filled with native 

2848
02:13:31,561 --> 02:13:33,060
Americans.
We just came in and like,

2849
02:13:33,061 --> 02:13:34,890
let me have this.
I'm taking that.

2850
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:35,790
Well,
Texas,

2851
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:37,680
so brutal.
I mean Texas,

2852
02:13:37,681 --> 02:13:41,100
they were fighting off the Cheyenne.
I mean those ranchers,

2853
02:13:41,210 --> 02:13:41,791
they,
they.

2854
02:13:41,791 --> 02:13:45,900
That was not established territory yet.
That's one of the reasons why Texans are

2855
02:13:45,901 --> 02:13:47,070
so fucking hard,
man.

2856
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:49,260
They,
yeah,

2857
02:13:49,261 --> 02:13:50,094
they were at one point in time,
they were a republic before they were 

2858
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,393
estate.
They were like this weird thing where 

2859
02:13:56,581 --> 02:13:58,830
they were kind of like,
not even a part of the United States.

2860
02:13:58,860 --> 02:14:00,450
Oh really?
Yeah.

2861
02:14:00,451 --> 02:14:04,200
Just so wild that just happened.
Yeah.

2862
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:05,423
Yeah.
We're talking thousands of years for 

2863
02:14:06,631 --> 02:14:10,950
your little toots and comments.
A little fucking guy with his club foot.

2864
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,110
A little bonehead.
Yeah.

2865
02:14:13,160 --> 02:14:13,993
Thousand.
That was thousands of years after King 

2866
02:14:15,841 --> 02:14:18,780
Tut people were taking wagons and going 
across the route.

2867
02:14:18,810 --> 02:14:19,890
Just going,
yeah.

2868
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:21,420
Yeah.
How crazy is that thing?

2869
02:14:21,690 --> 02:14:22,523
Thinking back 3000 years later,
people are still shooting bows and 

2870
02:14:25,801 --> 02:14:27,290
arrows at each other.
Yeah.

2871
02:14:27,390 --> 02:14:31,080
Three thousand years later.
Just completely wide open thousand.

2872
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:32,220
Yeah.
So why?

2873
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:33,083
Right.
So why weren't the native Americans 

2874
02:14:34,651 --> 02:14:36,990
before we got here?
Putting up those big statues?

2875
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:39,030
Well,
they lived a very different life.

2876
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:41,910
They lived in nomadic hunter gatherer 
life.

2877
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:43,103
They have this incredible spiritual 
connection to the land and to the 

2878
02:14:46,591 --> 02:14:49,800
animals that they hunted and they had a 
very,

2879
02:14:49,801 --> 02:14:51,870
very fascinated.
I mean there's a bunch of different,

2880
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:54,080
of course,
native American cultures per data,

2881
02:14:54,090 --> 02:14:54,923
very fascinating connection to the earth
and to the animals and the worship that 

2882
02:15:00,211 --> 02:15:01,044
they had,
the reverence they have for the animals 

2883
02:15:03,451 --> 02:15:04,860
and for life,
the trees.

2884
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:08,700
It's just crazy when you think about how
people were living in Europe at the same

2885
02:15:08,701 --> 02:15:09,534
time.
Yeah,

2886
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:11,310
yeah,
exactly.

2887
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:14,070
Just completely a totally different 
thing.

2888
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:16,770
Getting syphilis,
wearing powdered wigs,

2889
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:18,830
banging their sisters.
Yeah.

2890
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:22,590
So when they showed up and had gunpowder
and all the rest of the native Americans

2891
02:15:22,591 --> 02:15:23,424
didn't stand a chance.
What's crazy to me too is how many 

2892
02:15:25,231 --> 02:15:30,231
people that were Westerners,
they joined a native American tribes and

2893
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:34,080
we're living with them.
So really Kevin Costner.

2894
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:34,881
Yeah.
It was really.

2895
02:15:34,881 --> 02:15:37,650
It was common.
It happened and no one,

2896
02:15:37,710 --> 02:15:41,530
no one moved the other way like no one 
went the opera.

2897
02:15:42,030 --> 02:15:42,863
They were forced to.
American cultures decided I am going to 

2898
02:15:45,450 --> 02:15:46,660
move to the city.
No,

2899
02:15:46,990 --> 02:15:49,020
those are the saddest pictures of all 
time.

2900
02:15:49,021 --> 02:15:49,854
When you see those native Americans put 
in suits and ties and hats and standing 

2901
02:15:52,981 --> 02:15:53,814
there having to take pictures.
It was pictures of hard shoes and a 

2902
02:15:57,181 --> 02:15:59,370
city.
Brutal.

2903
02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:01,510
Oh,
bad.

2904
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:03,240
You know what?
It must've been a really interesting.

2905
02:16:03,241 --> 02:16:04,160
You know,
we're talking about your,

2906
02:16:04,210 --> 02:16:05,043
your vw,
which was from 20 years after the war 

2907
02:16:09,061 --> 02:16:10,110
with the Nazis.
Yeah.

2908
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:14,160
What about those wild bill wild west 
shows?

2909
02:16:14,390 --> 02:16:15,223
Yeah.
They had those wild west shows where 

2910
02:16:16,711 --> 02:16:21,711
they had men who had killed a bunch of 
colonists.

2911
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:23,820
Yeah,
and like there's a guy,

2912
02:16:23,850 --> 02:16:24,683
I think his name was mall.
It was this giant Indian guy who's just 

2913
02:16:28,531 --> 02:16:30,160
fucking murderer

2914
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:33,850
who killed a bunch of the settlers and 
he was.

2915
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:34,713
They would tour with him.
Wild bill would tour with this guy and 

2916
02:16:36,761 --> 02:16:40,870
they would do on their wild west show 
that shoot guns and do like show,

2917
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:43,280
pretend to fight each other kind of 
thing for people.

2918
02:16:43,281 --> 02:16:45,450
It was like a recreation of what it 
meant.

2919
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:47,620
What must have been like,
Geez,

2920
02:16:47,770 --> 02:16:51,100
when they captured territory from the 
native Americans,

2921
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:53,200
like they do these wild west shows.
Man,

2922
02:16:53,201 --> 02:16:56,000
that's how they made their living.
She became a big thing.

2923
02:16:56,001 --> 02:16:57,090
It's like the movies.
See,

2924
02:16:57,100 --> 02:17:00,670
pull up the wild west shows from the 18 
hundreds.

2925
02:17:01,550 --> 02:17:03,820
Fascinating time.
Crazy.

2926
02:17:03,821 --> 02:17:07,120
They just,
after this had all happened,

2927
02:17:07,130 --> 02:17:10,420
I was telling stories.
Nobody knew about it.

2928
02:17:10,421 --> 02:17:14,260
You will get your little weird newspaper
to read a little story.

2929
02:17:14,261 --> 02:17:17,920
No one really knew what was going on and
how little you knew what was going on.

2930
02:17:18,370 --> 02:17:22,670
Thing you knew nothing.
The town crier would come in here.

2931
02:17:22,671 --> 02:17:26,770
He here,
he main game up the top of it.

2932
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:30,030
It's now Massachusetts.
No one knew anything back.

2933
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:30,933
Nothing that pawnee bill shows the only 
genuine wild west touring America this 

2934
02:17:38,711 --> 02:17:39,544
season.
Over 1000 people and horses employed 

2935
02:17:42,850 --> 02:17:46,540
every equestrian nation in the world 
represented.

2936
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:49,120
Wow.
Two performances daily.

2937
02:17:49,121 --> 02:17:51,730
Weird and startling.
Free Street parade.

2938
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:55,120
That name Calamity Jane.
I love this.

2939
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:58,090
This is just the show business guy.
I wonder if there was a comedian in it.

2940
02:17:58,540 --> 02:17:59,980
Wild West shows.
Man,

2941
02:18:00,490 --> 02:18:04,000
and this was like early 19 hundreds,
late 18 hundreds.

2942
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:06,370
When was it that says 19?
Oh,

2943
02:18:06,371 --> 02:18:08,050
two.
Nineteen.

2944
02:18:08,051 --> 02:18:09,460
Oh three.
Wow.

2945
02:18:09,461 --> 02:18:10,410
So this is,
you know,

2946
02:18:10,450 --> 02:18:12,290
that'd be pretty cool.
Like for a young kid,

2947
02:18:12,291 --> 02:18:14,270
years after the,
you know,

2948
02:18:14,290 --> 02:18:17,020
they were still going to war with the 
native Americans.

2949
02:18:17,021 --> 02:18:19,030
Is that a picture of whatever.
They're crazy.

2950
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:19,550
Yeah.

2951
02:18:19,550 --> 02:18:20,800
There's another one that had a 
reenactment.

2952
02:18:20,801 --> 02:18:25,801
They did like custer's last stand and a 
train robberies and to see that like 19.

2953
02:18:27,161 --> 02:18:28,170
Oh one.
Sure.

2954
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:29,710
New York,
yet no movies.

2955
02:18:29,711 --> 02:18:31,870
He had nothing.
This was your movie.

2956
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:32,733
Oh my God.
It must have been amazing and you still 

2957
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:37,780
had to try to make sense of it all.
Like what happened?

2958
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:39,190
Yeah.
Do we get here?

2959
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:40,073
And especially like you said,
having the real guy there who you know 

2960
02:18:41,981 --> 02:18:42,814
could at one point just turn on 
everybody and start killing people in 

2961
02:18:45,191 --> 02:18:46,024
the audience.
There was one guy who was a giant and 

2962
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:55,030
see if you could find that native 
American wild west shows.

2963
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:58,930
I think his name was Mall Mall.
I think that was his name,

2964
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:02,710
so I don't remember his name.
Look at Buffalo Bill.

2965
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:06,280
Look at that,
just a showman and sitting bull.

2966
02:19:06,310 --> 02:19:08,410
He was a movie star hanging out 
together.

2967
02:19:08,470 --> 02:19:11,050
She's Jesus Christ.
Look,

2968
02:19:11,051 --> 02:19:13,720
I'm sorry we took all your land,
but let's just hear me out.

2969
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:14,583
I've got an idea.
We put some makeup on each other and we 

2970
02:19:17,561 --> 02:19:19,120
go out.
We do these shows.

2971
02:19:19,690 --> 02:19:20,800
Listen,
we got whiskey.

2972
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:24,370
A lot of white women or white women.
A lot of whiskey.

2973
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:26,050
We tour around.
We make money.

2974
02:19:26,051 --> 02:19:28,940
We charged these dopes.
Do two shows a day and we're out.

2975
02:19:29,150 --> 02:19:31,740
Do you think women were like crazy?
This guys had seen him.

2976
02:19:31,741 --> 02:19:32,541
Fuck.
Oh my God.

2977
02:19:32,541 --> 02:19:34,610
Look at him looking like probably 
scalped people.

2978
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:36,230
Yes.
The avengers.

2979
02:19:36,231 --> 02:19:40,010
Custer by killing and scalping yellow 
hair.

2980
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:41,203
Also called yellow hand,
which he called the first scout for 

2981
02:19:44,391 --> 02:19:47,240
custer change.
She's.

2982
02:19:47,450 --> 02:19:48,830
Yeah,
big ass show.

2983
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:51,710
But here's the thing,
man that just happened.

2984
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:56,840
All of this just happened.
We're talking about 1900 9,118

2985
02:19:56,841 --> 02:19:57,674
years ago.
It's almost a human lifespan like this 

2986
02:20:00,221 --> 02:20:01,054
is this,
this convergence of human beings was so 

2987
02:20:03,411 --> 02:20:03,830
recent.

2988
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:07,520
Killed these more probably like movies 
and radio people like for sure.

2989
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:11,510
Probably looks like a movie production.
Like when you see each other a bunch.

2990
02:20:13,070 --> 02:20:15,010
I'm sure there was some venereal disease
involved.

2991
02:20:15,030 --> 02:20:15,863
Oh yeah.
They probably all died of fucking 

2992
02:20:16,860 --> 02:20:18,310
herpes,
didn't they?

2993
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:20,640
They had guns.
They were actually shooting guns.

2994
02:20:20,810 --> 02:20:24,230
They had like competitions and shoot.
Shoot off to the last three to four hour

2995
02:20:24,231 --> 02:20:25,064
show.
Well that's why the Western was such a 

2996
02:20:26,781 --> 02:20:31,550
popular movie for decades because it was
still so fresh in people's minds.

2997
02:20:31,551 --> 02:20:32,384
I mean you had,
you had grandparents that knew this 

2998
02:20:35,541 --> 02:20:38,000
stuff right.
When you think about like the 19 fifties

2999
02:20:38,001 --> 02:20:40,880
western zone 100 years after the fact.
Yeah.

3000
02:20:40,970 --> 02:20:41,803
Right.
That's like us watching something about 

3001
02:20:42,951 --> 02:20:44,540
something that happened during the 
depression.

3002
02:20:44,541 --> 02:20:45,310
Yeah.
Right.

3003
02:20:45,310 --> 02:20:47,480
Like once upon a time in America or 
something like that.

3004
02:20:47,481 --> 02:20:47,841
Right?
Yeah.

3005
02:20:47,841 --> 02:20:48,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

3006
02:20:48,980 --> 02:20:49,813
Right.

3007
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:52,393
That is the coolest.
But it's what's so funny about it just 

3008
02:20:54,921 --> 02:20:55,754
show business.
It's like the beginning of show 

3009
02:20:57,381 --> 02:20:58,041
business.
Yeah.

3010
02:20:58,041 --> 02:20:59,960
Well he figured out posters.
I mean all of it.

3011
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:02,400
How much of it has really changed?
You know,

3012
02:21:02,401 --> 02:21:04,460
he put on a big show.
You make a cool poster,

3013
02:21:04,461 --> 02:21:06,380
you get these people to come and buy 
tickets.

3014
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:09,770
Two point 5 million tickets sold.
Wow.

3015
02:21:09,830 --> 02:21:11,780
Wow.
You know what's really fucked up dude?

3016
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:13,490
There was no comedy back then.
No,

3017
02:21:13,491 --> 02:21:14,091
stand up.
Well,

3018
02:21:14,091 --> 02:21:15,860
that's what I was going to ask Mark 
Twain.

3019
02:21:15,861 --> 02:21:16,694
When was Mark Twain running around?
Because he was kind of like the first 

3020
02:21:19,101 --> 02:21:21,710
stand up.
He would go do these shows and he read.

3021
02:21:21,750 --> 02:21:24,320
He writes about it like it's a standup 
performance.

3022
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:28,470
When was he has around?
Well they do.

3023
02:21:28,610 --> 02:21:30,710
He was talking about probably the first.
Yeah,

3024
02:21:30,711 --> 02:21:33,320
he was talking about things that didn't 
work for a laugh.

3025
02:21:33,570 --> 02:21:37,070
Oh yeah.
Hal Holbrook's touring as him.

3026
02:21:37,890 --> 02:21:41,360
He's always torn.
I didn't know that was like what?

3027
02:21:41,361 --> 02:21:45,590
When did he live?
What was was the lifespan of Twain.

3028
02:21:45,650 --> 02:21:48,890
So that's an interesting case in Mark 
Twain.

3029
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:49,783
Yeah.
They use the n word all the time in 

3030
02:21:51,710 --> 02:21:52,670
huckleberries.
Oh yeah.

3031
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:55,010
Big Time.
And they're removing that now.

3032
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:56,780
They were moving it,
removing it.

3033
02:21:56,810 --> 02:22:00,470
Who is editing it and removing it from 
the books.

3034
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:02,960
The publishers.
Come on.

3035
02:22:02,990 --> 02:22:03,750
That's.
I mean,

3036
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:04,583
you know,
you want to learn about a culture at a 

3037
02:22:07,611 --> 02:22:08,331
time.
Well,

3038
02:22:08,331 --> 02:22:10,730
one of the characters in Huckleberry 
Finn,

3039
02:22:10,731 --> 02:22:11,564
one of the main characters was nigger.
Jim knows his friend that they removed 

3040
02:22:16,161 --> 02:22:17,330
that.
The n word.

3041
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:19,810
Really?
Yeah.

3042
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:22,220
That's not weird.
Accurate.

3043
02:22:22,490 --> 02:22:23,360
Well that's.
Well that's.

3044
02:22:23,361 --> 02:22:27,360
Well that's sanitizing history and that 
stake because you don't learn from that.

3045
02:22:27,361 --> 02:22:28,194
Jamie,

3046
02:22:28,270 --> 02:22:33,270
pull that up,
pulled up the censoring of Tom Sawyer or

3047
02:22:35,981 --> 02:22:36,814
huckleberry Finn.

3048
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:38,433
Mark Twain had to build a little writing
room out in is out on his one so he 

3049
02:22:42,731 --> 02:22:45,610
could smoke a cigar is out there because
his wife wouldn't let him smoke cigars.

3050
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:49,870
So he built himself a little shed to say
go sit out there and smoke.

3051
02:22:49,930 --> 02:22:50,763
Good for him.
I just want to see when his life span 

3052
02:22:52,301 --> 02:22:55,210
was old twain.
Yeah.

3053
02:22:55,211 --> 02:22:57,100
He was funny.
He ever read Twain?

3054
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:59,120
Yes.
He was really like,

3055
02:22:59,121 --> 02:22:59,954
they're cutting.

3056
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:01,350
Um,
what does it say here?

3057
02:23:01,351 --> 02:23:03,960
Jamie?
Place the word with the word slave.

3058
02:23:04,170 --> 02:23:05,490
Whoa.
Okay.

3059
02:23:05,491 --> 02:23:07,860
Look at this.
A new effort to sanitize.

3060
02:23:07,861 --> 02:23:10,410
Huckleberry Finn Comes from Alan 
Gribbin,

3061
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:13,710
professor of English at Auburn 
University at Montgomery,

3062
02:23:13,711 --> 02:23:14,544
Alabama,
who has produced a new edition of 

3063
02:23:16,771 --> 02:23:17,604
Twain's novel.
The replaces that word with slave peers 

3064
02:23:21,810 --> 02:23:25,380
in the book more than 200 times was a 
common racial epithet of,

3065
02:23:25,410 --> 02:23:30,330
okay Duh use by twain as part of his 
characters of vernacular speech and as a

3066
02:23:30,331 --> 02:23:31,164
reflection of the mid 19th century 
social attitudes along the Mississippi 

3067
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:35,410
River.
There is a,

3068
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:36,853
so an effort,
but that doesn't mean that it's been 

3069
02:23:38,001 --> 02:23:38,350
done.

3070
02:23:38,350 --> 02:23:39,183
There's a ride at Disneyland,
I want to say it's either splash 

3071
02:23:44,891 --> 02:23:49,891
mountain or I think it is,
splash mountain,

3072
02:23:51,620 --> 02:23:52,453
splash mountain at Disneyland,
which was based on a really racist old 

3073
02:23:55,911 --> 02:23:59,000
cartoon that you can't get anymore 
called southern tails.

3074
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:03,640
I think it's called southern the 
Himalayan thing.

3075
02:24:03,670 --> 02:24:03,900
No,
no,

3076
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:04,370
no.
That's,

3077
02:24:04,370 --> 02:24:06,500
that's the matterhorn.

3078
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:09,670
Oh,
splash back in the briar.

3079
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:10,150
Yeah,
yeah,

3080
02:24:10,150 --> 02:24:10,561
yeah.
Right,

3081
02:24:10,561 --> 02:24:11,021
right,
right.

3082
02:24:11,021 --> 02:24:11,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

3083
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:12,310
That was good.

3084
02:24:12,310 --> 02:24:15,190
Prior Briar bear.
Briar Fox.

3085
02:24:15,250 --> 02:24:16,360
Yeah.
Brian Bear.

3086
02:24:16,390 --> 02:24:17,650
Fox.
Fox.

3087
02:24:17,970 --> 02:24:20,100
Yeah.
The whole thing is like,

3088
02:24:20,130 --> 02:24:24,360
it's a southern ride and we'll just all 
be singing ducks.

3089
02:24:24,630 --> 02:24:25,710
And uh,
we,

3090
02:24:25,711 --> 02:24:26,544
uh,
we went with a guide and the guy was 

3091
02:24:28,171 --> 02:24:29,004
explaining to us that this is all based 
on a really racist old thing that you 

3092
02:24:33,391 --> 02:24:35,430
can only get like bootleg copies of now.

3093
02:24:36,170 --> 02:24:37,300
Oh really?
Yeah.

3094
02:24:37,610 --> 02:24:42,060
So this is super racist old cards.
I had like the tar baby and the target.

3095
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:43,450
Right?
The tar baby thing.

3096
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:44,330
Well,
what is it?

3097
02:24:44,331 --> 02:24:45,520
It's southern tails,
right?

3098
02:24:45,521 --> 02:24:47,300
Is that what it's called?
To find the name of it?

3099
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:49,390
I'm just keep seeing firefox listed a 
bunch of times.

3100
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:52,060
A song of the south telling the song of 
the south.

3101
02:24:52,061 --> 02:24:53,700
I think that's the name of it,
right?

3102
02:24:53,710 --> 02:24:55,810
It's called Song of the south.
I think that's it.

3103
02:24:56,410 --> 02:24:58,810
I think that's the name of it right now 
that I think about it.

3104
02:24:58,840 --> 02:25:01,900
Yeah.
But it was a super racist.

3105
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:02,890
Yeah,
I believe it.

3106
02:25:03,140 --> 02:25:08,140
There's a lot of bad stuff back then.
What does it give do that?

3107
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:18,180
Yeah,
this is Zippity Doo Dah.

3108
02:25:18,210 --> 02:25:21,630
They sing this in the movie.
It's pretty dude.

3109
02:25:21,690 --> 02:25:21,870
Is

3110
02:25:21,870 --> 02:25:23,350
this,
why is this racist?

3111
02:25:23,410 --> 02:25:24,243
Well,
that's what they're asking is this 

3112
02:25:24,821 --> 02:25:27,550
racist song of the south right now.
It's just a guy singing it.

3113
02:25:28,410 --> 02:25:32,800
Yeah,
I don't think this is the racist part.

3114
02:25:32,801 --> 02:25:33,634
I think the reason why you can get this 
online is because it's not the racist 

3115
02:25:36,191 --> 02:25:38,890
stuff because this is just a guy singing
Mr.

3116
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:43,090
Blue Bird on my shoulder.
Myeloma.

3117
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,970
So Song of the south.
The move.

3118
02:25:45,971 --> 02:25:49,400
See if you could find song of the south.
Yes.

3119
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:50,720
With the clip that popped up when I 
grew.

3120
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:54,760
Yeah.
80 one percent.

3121
02:25:54,770 --> 02:25:59,770
Like to look at rotten tomatoes.
Seven point three on the imd being.

3122
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:05,110
So it's on imdv 1946.
Wow.

3123
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:10,770
Maybe it wasn't Mark Twain died in 1910.
So that means that he was walking around

3124
02:26:11,141 --> 02:26:14,690
as an old dude doing these performances.
Uh,

3125
02:26:14,830 --> 02:26:16,300
you know,
late 18 hundreds.

3126
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:21,520
And so maybe that was the kind of the 
beginning of a standup comedy.

3127
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:22,473
Go back to that,
go back to that page you were just on 

3128
02:26:23,921 --> 02:26:27,940
and that snopes article on it where they
do a fact check on the song of the south

3129
02:26:28,950 --> 02:26:30,050
to see it up there.
Yeah,

3130
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:31,033
I was gonna say I was going to double 
check it before I wanted to see what it 

3131
02:26:35,550 --> 02:26:36,383
says.
It's true,

3132
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:37,980
wasn't safe.
Uh,

3133
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:40,370
pull it up.
I had it up.

3134
02:26:41,290 --> 02:26:42,123
Oh,
song of the south and Naacp Song of the 

3135
02:26:44,201 --> 02:26:49,201
south unavailable on video in America 
because of the Naacp threats status.

3136
02:26:50,591 --> 02:26:53,290
True.
Wow.

3137
02:26:54,650 --> 02:26:56,740
So it was that racist and wonder what it
was.

3138
02:26:56,860 --> 02:26:59,680
There was so much racist shit back then.
Try or rabbit,

3139
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:03,640
right.
Or Fox bear bear.

3140
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:05,470
Why Breyer?
What does that mean?

3141
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:10,500
A briar like stuck in a Briar r dash e 
are briar rabbit burrow sprayer bear.

3142
02:27:14,561 --> 02:27:15,394
So that was the idea that they're stuck 
in briars the minstrel tradition of 

3143
02:27:17,771 --> 02:27:19,020
uncle remus stories.

3144
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:19,873
The major objections to the song of the 
south had to do with the live action 

3145
02:27:22,061 --> 02:27:22,894
portions filling been criticized for 
making slavery appear pleasant and 

3146
02:27:27,101 --> 02:27:31,510
pretending slavery didn't exist even 
though the film that's kind of.

3147
02:27:31,511 --> 02:27:34,060
You're caught in between lunch.
That potential what you just said,

3148
02:27:34,510 --> 02:27:35,343
even though the film,
like Harris original collection of 

3149
02:27:37,391 --> 02:27:38,224
stories is set after the civil war and 
the abolition of slavery still is 

3150
02:27:42,011 --> 02:27:45,700
folklorist Patricia rates.
Yeah.

3151
02:27:46,570 --> 02:27:49,090
That's fascinating.
So that's kind of interesting,

3152
02:27:49,091 --> 02:27:51,670
especially when you talk about the,
when you talk about,

3153
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:55,870
uh,
the huckleberry Finn Part,

3154
02:27:56,110 --> 02:27:56,861
like they're saying,
okay,

3155
02:27:56,861 --> 02:27:59,260
take that out.
And then this one,

3156
02:27:59,261 --> 02:28:00,094
they're saying they had an objection to 
making it seem like slavery didn't 

3157
02:28:01,991 --> 02:28:02,824
exist.
That's why you can't take it out of 

3158
02:28:04,540 --> 02:28:08,320
huckleberry Finn because you need to 
know that this existed.

3159
02:28:08,321 --> 02:28:13,230
We need to deal with it and understand 
it rather than sanitize it.

3160
02:28:13,270 --> 02:28:14,940
Problem is defending it.
Like,

3161
02:28:14,950 --> 02:28:17,560
like you can't do it.
You really.

3162
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:21,620
It's almost impossible to defend that.
The use of that word

3163
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:23,840
I'll give you wanted to defend the use 
of that where you say,

3164
02:28:23,841 --> 02:28:25,820
well,
we want to put that word back in a book.

3165
02:28:25,821 --> 02:28:27,200
People like,
what are you racist?

3166
02:28:27,270 --> 02:28:28,670
Right?
But you can't.

3167
02:28:28,710 --> 02:28:31,820
You know that rationally this is 
history.

3168
02:28:31,821 --> 02:28:32,571
Yeah.
Right.

3169
02:28:32,571 --> 02:28:33,620
Exactly.
Rational.

3170
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:34,483
Right.
There's no rationality when it comes to 

3171
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:36,943
dangerous.
Forbidden words as you saw from the 

3172
02:28:39,770 --> 02:28:40,603
Kendrick Lamar concert.
Right,

3173
02:28:42,190 --> 02:28:43,023
right.
I mean that's.

3174
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:44,373
I wonder what Twain would say.
Do you think that ultimately like this 

3175
02:28:47,691 --> 02:28:50,000
is all going to sort itself out like 
this,

3176
02:28:50,001 --> 02:28:53,210
all this political correct craziness and
this kind of shit,

3177
02:28:53,211 --> 02:28:54,044
that this is just a little rough patch 
of chaos that we get through on our way 

3178
02:28:57,711 --> 02:28:58,544
to establishing a new way of 
communicating with people a new way of 

3179
02:29:01,161 --> 02:29:03,980
appreciating each other and that,
you know,

3180
02:29:04,130 --> 02:29:07,700
all this.
Even the anti white racism and anti male

3181
02:29:07,701 --> 02:29:09,080
sexism and all this stuff.

3182
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:10,570
It's just a,
you know,

3183
02:29:10,571 --> 02:29:14,210
the wave going this way and then it'll 
go that way and then it'll settle in the

3184
02:29:14,211 --> 02:29:15,140
amount of.
Yes,

3185
02:29:15,141 --> 02:29:17,960
and then we're learning from even these 
missteps.

3186
02:29:17,961 --> 02:29:18,794
Like why can't we hate all men or 
anything like that that we learned from 

3187
02:29:22,011 --> 02:29:24,170
these missteps and the outrage that goes
to these missteps.

3188
02:29:24,171 --> 02:29:24,980
And we say,
Oh,

3189
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:27,140
I understand why this woman feels this 
way.

3190
02:29:27,290 --> 02:29:28,123
She's probably abused by men and dealt 
with asshole men and asshole bosses and 

3191
02:29:33,010 --> 02:29:37,910
see these people like Harvey Weinstein 
in the mainstream media that have abused

3192
02:29:37,911 --> 02:29:42,911
and violated and victimized women and 
that it is going to balance itself out.

3193
02:29:43,221 --> 02:29:44,054
And the only way it goes is you have to 
have outrage and then correction and 

3194
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:47,593
yeah,
I mean that's the way history seems to 

3195
02:29:48,801 --> 02:29:50,360
go.
It seems like,

3196
02:29:50,361 --> 02:29:51,170
you know,
there's,

3197
02:29:51,170 --> 02:29:53,060
you would think in certain ways like,
oh,

3198
02:29:53,061 --> 02:29:56,210
we don't have to work that hard to 
abolish these evils,

3199
02:29:56,211 --> 02:29:58,310
but then evil pops up again and it feels
like,

3200
02:29:58,311 --> 02:29:58,970
okay,
no,

3201
02:29:58,970 --> 02:29:59,600
it's still here.

3202
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:01,380
We still have to deal with it.
Yeah.

3203
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:04,190
And you just hope at the end we all end 
up like Bruno Mars.

3204
02:30:04,191 --> 02:30:05,024
We all look like Bruno Mars and 
everybody's happy because no one knows 

3205
02:30:07,701 --> 02:30:08,840
who,
what anybody is.

3206
02:30:08,841 --> 02:30:09,674
Yeah,
just having a good time and we're all a 

3207
02:30:10,761 --> 02:30:11,594
little darker and not totally white,
not totally black and everybody's but 

3208
02:30:14,470 --> 02:30:15,800
it.
But what about white people?

3209
02:30:15,801 --> 02:30:18,950
I like looking at white people.
I like people I like.

3210
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:21,950
I like the whole,
I liked the fact that we have variety in

3211
02:30:21,951 --> 02:30:24,670
the way people look.
Like some people look like seal and,

3212
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:27,580
and some people look like,
um,

3213
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:33,370
it was like a super white lady.
I'm like a cool kid.

3214
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:37,070
Nicole Kidman.
I bitches white.

3215
02:30:38,130 --> 02:30:38,963
Yeah.
White.

3216
02:30:40,010 --> 02:30:41,060
Almost red.
Yeah.

3217
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:44,120
Yeah,
it is good to have a nice mix.

3218
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:48,530
Fuck man.
It's fascinating.

3219
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:52,130
We're still these very tribal,
you know,

3220
02:30:52,131 --> 02:30:52,964
when you're talking about all these 
thousands of years and what we've done 

3221
02:30:54,681 --> 02:30:55,514
and where we've come seal this,
this just instinctual tribal element to 

3222
02:31:00,471 --> 02:31:03,530
a lot of humanity.
You got to get out of a Dick luck,

3223
02:31:03,531 --> 02:31:04,364
an axe handle to wear your shirt like 
that at that shirt shirt all the way 

3224
02:31:09,981 --> 02:31:13,900
down to his belly button with gold 
chains hanging out with the white trench

3225
02:31:13,901 --> 02:31:15,560
coat.
Yeah,

3226
02:31:15,740 --> 02:31:16,573
no,
you're packing and he's got sunglasses 

3227
02:31:18,051 --> 02:31:20,100
on at night,
which is a bold

3228
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:22,380
move that really only black people can 
pull.

3229
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,090
Yeah,
exactly.

3230
02:31:24,210 --> 02:31:29,210
Just owning it.
Slang and Duke and sang songs.

3231
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:30,390
Dude.
Uh,

3232
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:34,230
he um,
he,

3233
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:36,120
you don't hear about him anymore man.
Well,

3234
02:31:36,121 --> 02:31:36,954
you never know

3235
02:31:38,230 --> 02:31:40,590
dude.
When I first moved to California,

3236
02:31:40,591 --> 02:31:45,330
when I first got some money,
I was on this television show,

3237
02:31:45,331 --> 02:31:47,130
one of the first things I bought as a 
stereo.

3238
02:31:47,530 --> 02:31:51,950
So I always loved good music.
So I bought the Stereo and uh,

3239
02:31:51,951 --> 02:31:52,784
I bought seal and I remember listening 
to kiss by a rose from the grave or 

3240
02:31:56,850 --> 02:32:01,220
whatever the name of that song,
that song I'd never realized.

3241
02:32:01,230 --> 02:32:02,850
I never heard it on a good stereo 
before,

3242
02:32:02,851 --> 02:32:07,770
but I have these two speakers and like 
there's all these like layers and piano,

3243
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:09,450
tuned sex.
She's,

3244
02:32:09,820 --> 02:32:11,310
there's all this stuff that comes out 
of,

3245
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:12,173
you know,
when you're sitting in front of like 

3246
02:32:12,691 --> 02:32:13,830
good speakers.
Yeah.

3247
02:32:13,890 --> 02:32:15,540
You hear all the layers,
the music.

3248
02:32:15,541 --> 02:32:17,100
And I'd be like,
wow.

3249
02:32:19,430 --> 02:32:21,270
It was like hearing in zoo all over 
again.

3250
02:32:21,290 --> 02:32:23,640
Oh,
it was so like hearing it knew he was.

3251
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:24,870
I mean,
I guess he still is.

3252
02:32:24,990 --> 02:32:27,800
He's still alive,
but he is so fucking talented.

3253
02:32:28,110 --> 02:32:28,943
A real artist.
It's so different than like try naming 

3254
02:32:31,921 --> 02:32:33,750
someone who sounds like seal.

3255
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:35,690
Yeah.
Um,

3256
02:32:36,040 --> 02:32:39,790
I can't.
The black keys.

3257
02:32:40,510 --> 02:32:41,440
No,
no,

3258
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:44,770
no.
He's a fucking original man.

3259
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:47,350
Yeah.
Super.

3260
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:49,240
For essence,
I don't know,

3261
02:32:49,241 --> 02:32:52,360
it's just,
he's kind of a very unique style.

3262
02:32:52,390 --> 02:32:54,130
Yeah,
there's was a lot of those.

3263
02:32:54,220 --> 02:32:55,053
What's unique about.
There are a lot of artists that have 

3264
02:32:56,700 --> 02:32:57,533
really crazy kind of unique style,
but they don't become accepted from the 

3265
02:33:01,031 --> 02:33:02,330
mainstream.
By the mainstream.

3266
02:33:02,350 --> 02:33:03,100
Yeah.
Right.

3267
02:33:03,100 --> 02:33:03,933
Like there's,
he listen to kcrw in the morning and 

3268
02:33:05,441 --> 02:33:08,080
there's like a lot of weird experimental
stuff,

3269
02:33:08,081 --> 02:33:10,870
but not that many people know they 
exist.

3270
02:33:11,260 --> 02:33:12,093
CEO was able to make that like a.
So you're one of those hipsters listens 

3271
02:33:14,851 --> 02:33:15,684
to that show.
You and Henry rollins or kcrw like kcrw 

3272
02:33:19,481 --> 02:33:20,710
in the morning.
I don't know.

3273
02:33:20,711 --> 02:33:24,220
What morning sounds into radio in a 
decade.

3274
02:33:24,221 --> 02:33:25,200
For Real?
Yep.

3275
02:33:25,390 --> 02:33:27,550
Where do you get your new music?
I don't know.

3276
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:29,490
Come on right now.
I know.

3277
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:33,670
What gets you for father's day gets you 
some albums.

3278
02:33:33,790 --> 02:33:35,230
Performance though.
Is this recent?

3279
02:33:35,310 --> 02:33:35,721
No,
no,

3280
02:33:35,721 --> 02:33:36,071
no,
no.

3281
02:33:36,071 --> 02:33:37,440
This vh one.
Vh One.

3282
02:33:37,630 --> 02:33:39,430
This one of the things is when he was 
peeking.

3283
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:40,450
Vh One.
Still around.

3284
02:33:40,750 --> 02:33:42,580
Still around the real housewives and 
all.

3285
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:43,540
Yeah,
I think they do.

3286
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:46,150
Maybe that's Bravo.
All right.

3287
02:33:46,151 --> 02:33:46,984
Well then I didn't know that they used 
to play those like reality shows and 

3288
02:33:49,841 --> 02:33:50,674
stuff.
Yeah.

3289
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:52,690
Loving basketball or love and hip hop or
something.

3290
02:33:53,420 --> 02:33:54,400
Do that stuff.

3291
02:33:57,010 --> 02:34:01,110
Why did he have faced bubbles?
You mean this scarring?

3292
02:34:01,150 --> 02:34:02,770
Yeah.
I don't know.

3293
02:34:02,830 --> 02:34:03,663
Was that acne?
There's an article from three days ago 

3294
02:34:06,131 --> 02:34:07,990
that had that info.
Oh really?

3295
02:34:08,020 --> 02:34:09,970
Just three days ago.
Still thinking about it.

3296
02:34:10,810 --> 02:34:12,010
People are still asking him.
Well,

3297
02:34:12,011 --> 02:34:16,140
he was so good,
but was the coolest body of work is just

3298
02:34:16,180 --> 02:34:21,100
radically off a lesson that lupus had 
lupus.

3299
02:34:21,540 --> 02:34:22,600
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

3300
02:34:23,350 --> 02:34:25,960
That's where he's got the scarring from 
his face from lupus.

3301
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:30,160
Interesting.
Is that amazing?

3302
02:34:30,161 --> 02:34:32,320
You'd have it all down your face and 
still be like,

3303
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:33,183
no man,
I'm beautiful and you're going to think 

3304
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:37,600
to.
Well,

3305
02:34:37,601 --> 02:34:39,020
not really.
You don't get new music.

3306
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:42,100
You listen to new music.
I don't even know what it is.

3307
02:34:42,270 --> 02:34:44,200
I'm on Joe.
I told you.

3308
02:34:44,201 --> 02:34:45,490
I like Bruno Mars.
He's new.

3309
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,820
He's new.
That got somehow could cut.

3310
02:34:47,821 --> 02:34:49,640
He just dropped a new album this week 
too.

3311
02:34:49,700 --> 02:34:54,100
Moody,
Moody with your white privilege.

3312
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:58,360
You son of a bitch appropriating it.
Cut.

3313
02:34:58,380 --> 02:34:59,690
Is it mute?
Moody.

3314
02:35:01,470 --> 02:35:02,303
Depression based music.
He's getting his feelings out kind of 

3315
02:35:04,181 --> 02:35:04,781
stuff.
Yeah.

3316
02:35:04,781 --> 02:35:06,940
He bought a lot of deals with mental 
illness.

3317
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,760
You don't lucky you liked bake bread and
cookies and shit.

3318
02:35:09,830 --> 02:35:10,990
Oh,
I love it.

3319
02:35:10,991 --> 02:35:12,370
So you,
you don't like Moody Shit,

3320
02:35:12,371 --> 02:35:13,750
Dude.
I do love moody stuff.

3321
02:35:13,751 --> 02:35:15,070
I like,
I've listened to him.

3322
02:35:15,071 --> 02:35:16,080
I get every,
everyone,

3323
02:35:16,130 --> 02:35:18,430
he's one of those prove themselves so 
early.

3324
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:19,293
Like I just loved it.
So they don't just get whatever he puts 

3325
02:35:21,251 --> 02:35:23,650
out Wilco's like that.
He's like that.

3326
02:35:23,651 --> 02:35:25,540
It's just like.
So you're into the hip hop,

3327
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,670
eh?
A little bit.

3328
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:28,930
I try,
but I,

3329
02:35:28,931 --> 02:35:29,850
you know,
do like old,

3330
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:31,900
older stuff.
Older hip hop.

3331
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:33,760
Do you like Gangstarr?
No.

3332
02:35:33,860 --> 02:35:38,420
How dare you put down and get the fuck 
Outta here?

3333
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:40,320
Not like Gangstarr.

3334
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:42,340
I don't even know.
Gangster.

3335
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:45,640
So you hurt my feelings.
Come on.

3336
02:35:45,641 --> 02:35:48,010
Or were you in the nineties?
I was uh,

3337
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:51,460
I was around.
I was running around in the nineties,

3338
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:53,980
early nineties.
Grateful dead.

3339
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:56,880
That's the end of the dead.
Grateful dead.

3340
02:35:56,950 --> 02:35:57,783
Uh,
you liked the grateful dead almond 

3341
02:35:59,670 --> 02:36:01,000
brothers.
Did you like the grateful dead?

3342
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:04,810
Allman brothers and brothers?
Gangstarr?

3343
02:36:05,740 --> 02:36:07,870
Uh,
I was listening to yourself a favor.

3344
02:36:07,871 --> 02:36:08,704
Download a decade of it.
I was listening to tribe called quest 

3345
02:36:11,201 --> 02:36:14,020
and you know,
here's another one that went away.

3346
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:17,560
De la soul know.
They were so great.

3347
02:36:17,770 --> 02:36:22,210
They were de la de la de la,
so they were amazing dude.

3348
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:23,073
They were great.
They were hot like right when I first 

3349
02:36:26,171 --> 02:36:27,210
got into comedy.
Oh,

3350
02:36:27,211 --> 02:36:29,080
that's so cool.
Dude.

3351
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:36,180
Three feet high and rising run DMC.
Well that's great that they released all

3352
02:36:36,461 --> 02:36:37,294
their music,
but their music came from like six 

3353
02:36:38,321 --> 02:36:41,500
months,
six months of music.

3354
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:45,820
Like what the fuck man uses.
I Love Nas.

3355
02:36:45,850 --> 02:36:46,840
Yeah,
Nas fan,

3356
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:51,640
but here's what gets me.
How does someone put out something?

3357
02:36:51,641 --> 02:36:53,950
How does a group put out something 
that's so good?

3358
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:54,833
Yeah,
for a short period of time and then not 

3359
02:36:57,580 --> 02:37:02,580
bump bump.
Bump three had a great fucking song.

3360
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:08,050
They were really good and they were 
interesting.

3361
02:37:08,051 --> 02:37:10,240
It's hard to keep a band together and 
they were.

3362
02:37:10,241 --> 02:37:11,860
Yeah,
they were good to get high too.

3363
02:37:12,010 --> 02:37:13,120
You know?
We probably did a man,

3364
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:16,740
some white bitches,
white girl,

3365
02:37:16,741 --> 02:37:19,280
son of a bitch came along,
fucked everything up.

3366
02:37:20,320 --> 02:37:21,560
I just don't like the way he looks at 
you.

3367
02:37:21,561 --> 02:37:26,561
When you saying I liked hip hop and 
stuff and I still do,

3368
02:37:28,761 --> 02:37:29,840
but it's a very,
you know,

3369
02:37:29,841 --> 02:37:32,130
old white guy waves doing and find it.

3370
02:37:32,150 --> 02:37:34,040
When I find it,
I know it must be over.

3371
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:38,480
Like why that,
that I found Kendrick,

3372
02:37:38,481 --> 02:37:39,081
I was like,
oh,

3373
02:37:39,081 --> 02:37:41,990
so this is done right.
Once you find it,

3374
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:44,140
it's over.
Interesting.

3375
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:47,540
I don't think it's enough to kill 
Kendrick Lamar has momentum,

3376
02:37:47,541 --> 02:37:50,420
but you know,
he's got too much momentum.

3377
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:51,980
Yeah.
But it was like,

3378
02:37:51,981 --> 02:37:52,580
okay,
why?

3379
02:37:52,580 --> 02:37:54,470
I mean if it got to me,
you know,

3380
02:37:54,471 --> 02:37:57,020
and I tried like I tried to listen to 
music,

3381
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:57,913
you know,
it's different when you're young and it 

3382
02:37:58,491 --> 02:37:59,324
just hits you and you from your friends.
And I have to like really try and find 

3383
02:38:02,631 --> 02:38:03,464
music now because I have no friends.
I go to Jamie and then I have to throw 

3384
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:09,620
it through a filter that's throw it 
through A.

3385
02:38:09,621 --> 02:38:11,040
Yeah,
but he wears yeezys.

3386
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:15,670
Exactly.
He's making it all becomes on two weeks.

3387
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:17,810
Doesn't really.
Kanya is producing nozzles,

3388
02:38:17,811 --> 02:38:18,190
new albums.

3389
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:20,170
I'm not saying that it doesn't produce 
good music,

3390
02:38:20,490 --> 02:38:25,010
I'm just saying it's sneakers killer 
Mike.

3391
02:38:25,011 --> 02:38:29,120
I like killer Mike Jayco A.
Yeah,

3392
02:38:29,121 --> 02:38:30,590
like a lot of stuff,
but you know,

3393
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:32,570
it's a big,
it's a big range.

3394
02:38:32,900 --> 02:38:36,320
If you listen to bluegrass and hip hop,
it means you're just tasting it all.

3395
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:41,380
I feel like music is a lot like movies 
in that people are constantly making new

3396
02:38:42,321 --> 02:38:44,690
stuff and you can't see it all or.
Yeah,

3397
02:38:44,870 --> 02:38:46,640
it's true.
I mean think about movies.

3398
02:38:46,700 --> 02:38:47,533
They have been making movies since 
whenever the fuck they started making 

3399
02:38:49,641 --> 02:38:53,810
movies and every week they come out with
new movies.

3400
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:54,860
You're right.
No one ever says,

3401
02:38:54,861 --> 02:38:55,970
Hey folks,
you know,

3402
02:38:55,971 --> 02:38:57,770
we just realized that we keep making 
movies.

3403
02:38:57,980 --> 02:38:59,420
You're never going to watch the 
godfather.

3404
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:02,690
We're going to watch taxi driver.
You never going to watch the classics,

3405
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:04,540
so we're going to stop making movies for
awhile.

3406
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:08,060
They'll let you fuckers catch up 10 
years off now we'll start off and again,

3407
02:39:08,061 --> 02:39:11,780
10 years he just cranking them out.
It's going even more because now you can

3408
02:39:11,781 --> 02:39:14,480
just make them on your phone,
like via technology to be able to make a

3409
02:39:14,481 --> 02:39:16,370
movie.
So you can just do it.

3410
02:39:16,430 --> 02:39:19,180
Dude.
You mean the phones that we have now are

3411
02:39:19,490 --> 02:39:21,560
dog shit compared to the phones will 
have in 10 years.

3412
02:39:21,970 --> 02:39:24,730
Soderbergh just shot a whole horror 
movie on his iphone.

3413
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:25,640
Did he really?
Yeah.

3414
02:39:25,790 --> 02:39:27,560
What is it?
It's called unsane.

3415
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:28,940
Whoa.
Yeah.

3416
02:39:29,810 --> 02:39:30,643
Girl trapped in a mental institution.
Isn't there a horror movie that's out 

3417
02:39:33,501 --> 02:39:36,080
right now called hereditary?
What is that about?

3418
02:39:36,110 --> 02:39:38,140
Is that a good one?
Let's be really good.

3419
02:39:38,590 --> 02:39:43,590
I'll play the trailer trailers 
sometimes.

3420
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:47,630
Sometimes the trailers.
The most enjoyable part of the movement.

3421
02:39:47,670 --> 02:39:50,480
Sometimes a lot to give you too much 
though.

3422
02:39:50,570 --> 02:39:52,700
Oh yeah.
They do that with comedies,

3423
02:39:52,701 --> 02:39:53,260
man.
They.

3424
02:39:53,260 --> 02:39:54,770
They give you too many God damn 
punchline.

3425
02:39:55,050 --> 02:39:58,180
Give me some volume.
Crank it would get in trouble for this.

3426
02:39:58,181 --> 02:40:00,020
I don't will get pulled from youtube 
trailer.

3427
02:40:00,050 --> 02:40:01,820
We're helping them.
I mean if you're honest,

3428
02:40:01,821 --> 02:40:03,320
you guys were like talking over emoting 
them.

3429
02:40:03,321 --> 02:40:05,210
It can maybe stop at 37.
Give me some books.

3430
02:40:05,211 --> 02:40:06,044
Scary.
It starts with a doll house that is a 

3431
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:12,350
scary dog or an architectural design.
A model.

3432
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,100
A minute.
Man

3433
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:18,150
Walks in it.
That was cool.

3434
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:21,400
It made it look like a real room under 
ground.

3435
02:40:23,060 --> 02:40:27,180
It's hard to production companies and 
exchange new faces here today and I know

3436
02:40:27,181 --> 02:40:30,570
my mom would be very touched and 
probably a little suspicious.

3437
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:32,453
Gabriel Burns in it.
My mother was a very secretive and 

3438
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:40,100
private woman from the producer of the 
show,

3439
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:42,660
which,
which I didn't see a favorite.

3440
02:40:42,770 --> 02:40:44,020
It was good though.
Oh,

3441
02:40:44,030 --> 02:40:47,810
and what's your name?
Baby Shark at?

3442
02:40:48,190 --> 02:40:50,310
No,
she was a very difficult woman.

3443
02:40:50,320 --> 02:40:51,153
Damon wins.
Maybe explain to me from your mother 

3444
02:40:56,490 --> 02:41:01,490
sometimes.
I swear I can feel a kid.

3445
02:41:06,720 --> 02:41:09,180
She cut her head off a dead bird.
If it's crazy.

3446
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:11,940
You got a kid with mental problems.
She says,

3447
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:15,330
look at what demons.
She looks good.

3448
02:41:15,990 --> 02:41:19,490
Private friends.
Generations.

3449
02:41:19,740 --> 02:41:20,573
The exercise took care of me.
You don't think I'm going to take care 

3450
02:41:22,921 --> 02:41:27,921
of you when you die.
Just coming up with real hard.

3451
02:41:29,860 --> 02:41:34,020
She wasn't altogether unspeakable kind.
This looks good at the end.

3452
02:41:41,950 --> 02:41:46,950
Wow.
Very scary.

3453
02:41:58,900 --> 02:41:59,900
I just don't want to put any more.

3454
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:05,630
It looks good.
That looks scary.

3455
02:42:05,631 --> 02:42:08,240
I can't see it.
Why can't you see it?

3456
02:42:08,241 --> 02:42:09,074
Because I can't see anything.
When do you see things I'm talking 

3457
02:42:11,841 --> 02:42:12,890
about?
We just said,

3458
02:42:12,920 --> 02:42:15,680
look,
do you ever watch stuff?

3459
02:42:16,030 --> 02:42:18,800
I'd go to the movies.
When do you do that?

3460
02:42:18,890 --> 02:42:23,030
Whenever I can see you're writing books 
and Bacon bread.

3461
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:25,820
Take a couple of hours off.
Go to the God damn movies.

3462
02:42:26,360 --> 02:42:28,790
Writing is killing.
I really haven't.

3463
02:42:28,970 --> 02:42:30,230
My father said that to her the other 
day.

3464
02:42:30,231 --> 02:42:32,240
Watch it on.
Watch this movie on the plane.

3465
02:42:32,241 --> 02:42:33,074
I'm like,
I haven't watched a movie on a plane in 

3466
02:42:34,101 --> 02:42:36,080
two years.
What was the movie that Eddie Bravo city

3467
02:42:36,081 --> 02:42:38,630
saw for like six minutes and then he 
left.

3468
02:42:39,020 --> 02:42:41,570
Oh yeah,
some not.

3469
02:42:41,990 --> 02:42:43,480
It was one of the new,
uh,

3470
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:45,900
was a big blockbuster movie.
Oh yeah.

3471
02:42:46,070 --> 02:42:47,480
Was it Black Panther?
No,

3472
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:49,550
no,
it was the avengers.

3473
02:42:50,680 --> 02:42:51,740
Damn.
Oh,

3474
02:42:51,741 --> 02:42:52,574
they,
uh,

3475
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:53,870
that new one.
The uh,

3476
02:42:53,900 --> 02:42:54,733
wasn't deadpool because I think it 
might've been the avengers or something 

3477
02:42:56,630 --> 02:42:58,530
that new avengers one that everyone 
loves,

3478
02:42:58,531 --> 02:43:00,290
but doesn't make sense that he would 
have walked out of that so quick.

3479
02:43:00,291 --> 02:43:02,570
I don't remember what it was because 
everyone loves this will make sense.

3480
02:43:02,571 --> 02:43:05,240
Period.
He's got a weird taste.

3481
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:09,140
Do you go to the movies?
How often do you go to the movies?

3482
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:11,650
Once a month,
month,

3483
02:43:11,650 --> 02:43:12,100
month,

3484
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:13,570
maybe once.
Yeah.

3485
02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:15,970
I watched some on flights,
you know,

3486
02:43:16,090 --> 02:43:18,940
when they come out,
I don't really get too much of a chance.

3487
02:43:19,240 --> 02:43:19,961
Um,
you know what?

3488
02:43:19,961 --> 02:43:24,280
I really enjoyed that Tom cruise movie 
about barry seal made in America.

3489
02:43:24,370 --> 02:43:25,480
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3490
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:27,340
I was pretty.
It was good.

3491
02:43:27,400 --> 02:43:28,900
Yeah.
I was pretty surprised by that.

3492
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:32,080
That's a good goddamn movie.
You forget how good Tom Cruise's too.

3493
02:43:32,110 --> 02:43:33,310
He's,
he's great.

3494
02:43:33,790 --> 02:43:36,640
I mean all of the crazy talk show stuff 
aside.

3495
02:43:36,641 --> 02:43:37,950
That guy's amazing.
Well,

3496
02:43:37,960 --> 02:43:41,260
it was a scientologist.
He's got his own stuff,

3497
02:43:41,261 --> 02:43:42,094
but he makes good movies,
but people who are out of their mind 

3498
02:43:44,110 --> 02:43:45,700
make good shit.
Yeah.

3499
02:43:46,100 --> 02:43:48,510
That's part of the thing.
Yes.

3500
02:43:48,700 --> 02:43:52,930
Part of the being good at stuff.
Just some of the crazy assholes.

3501
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:53,980
Yeah.
Good Shit.

3502
02:43:54,160 --> 02:43:57,000
They really do.
A lot of times you can harness it word.

3503
02:43:57,120 --> 02:43:59,860
If you can harness it and put it into,
into something.

3504
02:43:59,950 --> 02:44:00,850
It's good movie,
man.

3505
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:02,560
Yeah.
All right.

3506
02:44:02,561 --> 02:44:07,561
I'll make it impossible to come on.
Cruise comes out in a couple of weeks.

3507
02:44:07,740 --> 02:44:09,160
I'm just going to live.
That's what I hear.

3508
02:44:09,670 --> 02:44:13,710
Go cruise gets to the end and he lives.
He does all his own stunts of shit.

3509
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:14,800
He's going to drive that thing.
Oh,

3510
02:44:16,710 --> 02:44:18,280
he just.
He just does that.

3511
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:21,730
He does a lot of stunts.
Pretty crazy for a dude who's.

3512
02:44:22,570 --> 02:44:27,190
He think he is 53 or 54 and he's still 
doing all his own stunts.

3513
02:44:27,191 --> 02:44:28,420
Yeah,
it's pretty bad ass.

3514
02:44:29,110 --> 02:44:30,400
Yeah.
He was in a.

3515
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:35,620
What was that Jack reacher movie though?
That one was a Turd.

3516
02:44:35,990 --> 02:44:37,220
Making another one?
No,

3517
02:44:37,270 --> 02:44:39,460
I think it might've been John Wick.
They're going to have doing a third one.

3518
02:44:39,490 --> 02:44:40,840
Of course.
Doing it right?

3519
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:42,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

3520
02:44:42,650 --> 02:44:44,140
He got killed.
I repeat.

3521
02:44:44,141 --> 02:44:47,170
He was in with an awesome movie.
I think it changed the name of it.

3522
02:44:47,170 --> 02:44:48,460
I don't think that's what it was 
originally called,

3523
02:44:48,461 --> 02:44:50,530
but now we have to keep redoing the 
scene.

3524
02:44:50,920 --> 02:44:53,700
He goes back and they ended up like 
killing everyone in.

3525
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:58,540
What's that movie?
The day after tomorrow.

3526
02:44:58,610 --> 02:45:02,920
Oh right.
Wasn't that used to be called killed?

3527
02:45:02,921 --> 02:45:05,470
I repeat Egypt tomorrow.
Edge of tomorrow.

3528
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:08,950
That's right.
That movie was fucking bad ass.

3529
02:45:08,980 --> 02:45:12,880
That was a really,
really good science fiction movie,

3530
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:15,100
but it was one of the ones that came 
out.

3531
02:45:15,101 --> 02:45:16,860
What year did it come out?
14.

3532
02:45:17,020 --> 02:45:19,660
Two thousand.
14 was just a few years removed from him

3533
02:45:19,661 --> 02:45:22,120
being wacky when he did that.
Uh,

3534
02:45:22,150 --> 02:45:25,250
Matt Lauer interview on the today show 
where it was like,

3535
02:45:25,270 --> 02:45:26,220
you're being Glib,
Matt,

3536
02:45:26,230 --> 02:45:27,063
you're being Glib,
but he's talking about Brooke Shields 

3537
02:45:28,631 --> 02:45:31,810
taking psychiatric medication and you 
understand this.

3538
02:45:31,811 --> 02:45:33,220
I understand this.
Yeah.

3539
02:45:33,640 --> 02:45:37,540
Scientology is highly critical of 
psychiatric meditation.

3540
02:45:37,750 --> 02:45:39,900
They prefer you stay crazy.
They don't.

3541
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:41,170
You don't know what you're talking 
about.

3542
02:45:41,171 --> 02:45:42,160
Matt,
have you done the research?

3543
02:45:42,161 --> 02:45:43,870
I've done the research.
You're Glib,

3544
02:45:44,440 --> 02:45:45,273
Glib,
but lauer didn't handle it that good 

3545
02:45:47,441 --> 02:45:49,150
either.
Now you're supposed to go.

3546
02:45:49,151 --> 02:45:49,984
We'll explain to me the mechanism of the
what's happening with the psychiatric 

3547
02:45:53,831 --> 02:45:55,790
drugs and what do you pose?
Yeah.

3548
02:45:55,870 --> 02:45:56,703
And why do you think that you understand
the biological makeup of all these 

3549
02:45:59,351 --> 02:46:00,184
different human beings and that none of 
them should be taking psychiatric 

3550
02:46:02,921 --> 02:46:03,754
medication now?
That's a crazy thing to say that you're 

3551
02:46:05,231 --> 02:46:06,064
smarter than all these biologists and 
medical scientists and all these people 

3552
02:46:09,561 --> 02:46:10,340
that have concocted

3553
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:13,370
these SSRI and different.
Have you done the research?

3554
02:46:13,400 --> 02:46:15,790
Have you done,
you done the research or you glib making

3555
02:46:15,870 --> 02:46:19,060
top gun to right now to ever tell you?
The first time I did Letterman,

3556
02:46:19,070 --> 02:46:22,100
when Cruz was on it,
they ever tell you that story?

3557
02:46:22,370 --> 02:46:25,090
No,
I was doing my first letterman.

3558
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:27,260
I'm super nervous and I'm just trying to
tell myself,

3559
02:46:27,261 --> 02:46:28,730
you know,
just like any other show.

3560
02:46:28,731 --> 02:46:30,550
It's just like any other show,
you know,

3561
02:46:31,020 --> 02:46:34,310
Tom Cruise is this first time.
He's on the show in like 10 years,

3562
02:46:34,311 --> 02:46:37,400
15 years,
and he's on and I'm watching through the

3563
02:46:37,401 --> 02:46:39,490
monitoring.
He's running up and down the uh,

3564
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:42,670
he's running up and down the hall where 
the theaters,

3565
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:44,660
like saying hi to people at during the 
break.

3566
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:45,380
No.
Yeah.

3567
02:46:45,380 --> 02:46:46,160
He's like,
hey,

3568
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:49,100
was just like running up and down and 
having this great time.

3569
02:46:49,101 --> 02:46:50,610
Like it's just,
it's just another show,

3570
02:46:50,980 --> 02:46:51,813
it'll be okay,
and then they bring you down stairs and 

3571
02:46:53,721 --> 02:46:54,554
you're standing outside this door,
like to go onto the stage and he says 

3572
02:46:57,780 --> 02:47:02,780
goodnight during the show and he,
the door swings open and a very sweaty.

3573
02:47:03,771 --> 02:47:07,340
Tom Cruise is like nose to nose with me 
and he's like,

3574
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:08,930
you're next.
And he hugs me.

3575
02:47:08,931 --> 02:47:09,920
He's like,
Woo,

3576
02:47:09,921 --> 02:47:10,754
it's great out there.
It goes bouncing up the stairs and I'm 

3577
02:47:13,701 --> 02:47:15,870
like,
what's going to happen to me out?

3578
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:21,110
This is terrifying.
He totally took all of my coolness.

3579
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:24,260
Just chew a little strange guy.
Yeah,

3580
02:47:24,290 --> 02:47:27,500
but the energy just,
he was like an electric eel and I'm just

3581
02:47:27,501 --> 02:47:28,221
like,
it's all right.

3582
02:47:28,221 --> 02:47:30,410
I can get through this.
He's such a strange,

3583
02:47:30,411 --> 02:47:34,820
strange guy when he gets into that,
like I'm laughing.

3584
02:47:34,821 --> 02:47:36,170
Thing is just gets weird.

3585
02:47:42,060 --> 02:47:47,060
Oh God,
no.

3586
02:47:53,220 --> 02:47:55,070
It wasn't such a high altitude that it 
would've,

3587
02:47:55,090 --> 02:47:56,700
you know,
death.

3588
02:47:56,710 --> 02:48:01,710
Right.
I'm standing in the wings right now.

3589
02:48:03,070 --> 02:48:05,840
What are you thinking?
Like what am I going to say first?

3590
02:48:06,130 --> 02:48:07,540
Yeah.
Just to think with those things.

3591
02:48:07,541 --> 02:48:10,120
Those things are such a little weird.
Sprint has my tie.

3592
02:48:10,180 --> 02:48:11,210
How's my tie?
Right?

3593
02:48:11,290 --> 02:48:13,150
What's my first line?
What am I going to say?

3594
02:48:13,430 --> 02:48:15,730
Try.
Did I go out casual?

3595
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:16,713
Yeah.
There's a heated interview from Matt 

3596
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:19,293
Lauer.
Play that.

3597
02:48:20,270 --> 02:48:21,690
It's right there.
I was coming up next.

3598
02:48:21,810 --> 02:48:23,220
Here it is.
Here's Matt,

3599
02:48:23,260 --> 02:48:24,510
Matt,
a full head of hair back.

3600
02:48:24,550 --> 02:48:26,430
Then we'll get back.
He's got all that hair.

3601
02:48:26,650 --> 02:48:27,483
Two thousand 14.
Looking at my handsome bastard radio 

3602
02:48:30,531 --> 02:48:31,364
play.
It was my first exposure to this story 

3603
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:33,553
than just an alien movie.
The story breaks down on a lot of 

3604
02:48:35,821 --> 02:48:40,590
different levels and in one to each 
other already not the best father in the

3605
02:48:40,591 --> 02:48:43,470
world when we are working on the story.
Originally,

3606
02:48:43,471 --> 02:48:44,420
three years ago,
Steven,

3607
02:48:44,430 --> 02:48:45,420
I came up with this idea of nature

3608
02:48:45,430 --> 02:48:49,420
keen about a family.
That was a good movie.

3609
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:51,050
I'd love to.
Yeah,

3610
02:48:51,100 --> 02:48:51,933
me too.

3611
02:48:53,670 --> 02:48:55,190
Okay.
You want to go inside?

3612
02:48:55,530 --> 02:48:58,410
Of course you do that real sense of like
where we're going to go.

3613
02:48:59,190 --> 02:49:00,540
Well,
that's what I think it would probably be

3614
02:49:00,541 --> 02:49:03,420
like if we did get invaded to be robots 
like that.

3615
02:49:03,480 --> 02:49:05,960
Yeah.
That'll be cool.

3616
02:49:06,590 --> 02:49:07,423
Play some of.

3617
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,263
Before I was a scientologist,
I never agreed with psychiatry and then 

3618
02:49:11,131 --> 02:49:13,170
when I started studying the history of 
psychiatry,

3619
02:49:13,171 --> 02:49:16,200
I started realizing more and more why I 
didn't agree with psychiatry.

3620
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:17,880
And as far as the Brooke shields thing 
is,

3621
02:49:17,881 --> 02:49:20,880
look you,
I understand.

3622
02:49:20,881 --> 02:49:25,881
I really care about Brooke Shields.
I here is a wonderful and talented woman

3623
02:49:30,340 --> 02:49:31,173
and uh,
I want to see her do well and I know 

3624
02:49:35,500 --> 02:49:40,240
that a psychiatry is,
it's a pseudo science,

3625
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:41,393
but Tom,
if she said that this particular thing 

3626
02:49:43,930 --> 02:49:44,763
helped her feel better,
whether it was the anti depressant or 

3627
02:49:46,931 --> 02:49:50,590
going to a counselor or a psychiatrist.
Isn't that enough?

3628
02:49:50,790 --> 02:49:51,670
You have to understand this.

3629
02:49:53,550 --> 02:49:54,383
Here we are today where I talk out 
against drugs and psychiatric abuses of 

3630
02:49:59,071 --> 02:49:59,904
electric shocking people against their 
will of drugging children with them not 

3631
02:50:04,681 --> 02:50:06,630
knowing he's got good,
good effects of these drugs.

3632
02:50:06,631 --> 02:50:09,150
Do you know what adderall is?
Do you know Rhydlin?

3633
02:50:09,300 --> 02:50:11,430
Do you know now that Ritalin is a street
drug?

3634
02:50:12,390 --> 02:50:15,190
Do you understand that the differences.
This was not a.

3635
02:50:16,170 --> 02:50:18,940
This wasn't against your question.
I'm asking you a question.

3636
02:50:18,941 --> 02:50:21,290
I understand there's abuse of all of 
these things.

3637
02:50:21,310 --> 02:50:21,960
Now.
You see,

3638
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:22,793
here's the problem.
You don't know the history of 

3639
02:50:24,061 --> 02:50:26,120
psychiatry.
I do aren't.

3640
02:50:26,130 --> 02:50:30,480
There are examples in my book shields be
an example of someone who benefited from

3641
02:50:30,481 --> 02:50:33,300
one of those drugs.
All it does is mask the problem,

3642
02:50:33,470 --> 02:50:35,400
Matt,
and if you understand the history of it,

3643
02:50:35,401 --> 02:50:38,130
it masks the problem.
That's what it does.

3644
02:50:38,490 --> 02:50:39,323
He is pretty aggressive on Lauer.
Makiko not getting to that wasn't being 

3645
02:50:42,391 --> 02:50:42,780
shitty.

3646
02:50:42,780 --> 02:50:45,500
He's just.
He's just like intense.

3647
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:47,310
Meanwhile,
he's right about a lot of it.

3648
02:50:47,311 --> 02:50:50,560
He's definitely right about adderall and
Ritalin that some people abuse it,

3649
02:50:51,180 --> 02:50:52,013
but abuse.
Just because someone abuses it doesn't 

3650
02:50:56,041 --> 02:50:58,580
mean it doesn't have uses.
You know?

3651
02:50:58,590 --> 02:50:59,790
It doesn't.
I don't.

3652
02:51:00,270 --> 02:51:03,930
I've met people that are on adderall and
they see they need it.

3653
02:51:04,410 --> 02:51:05,530
I don't know if they're right.
Yeah,

3654
02:51:05,550 --> 02:51:10,550
but the guy who developed adderall says 
that it should be for about four percent

3655
02:51:11,191 --> 02:51:15,080
of the population.
That's a lot like four people out of 100

3656
02:51:15,210 --> 02:51:18,150
and a room full of 100 people.
Four of them are cranked out and doctors

3657
02:51:18,151 --> 02:51:21,090
are cranking it out like 30 percent 
patients.

3658
02:51:21,091 --> 02:51:21,840
They say,
yeah,

3659
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:22,673
it's like super high that he.
The guy who made it so that it's being 

3660
02:51:24,931 --> 02:51:26,610
abused a while,
I'm sure it is.

3661
02:51:26,700 --> 02:51:28,320
And amongst Germany.
Have you done the research?

3662
02:51:28,321 --> 02:51:29,430
Joe?
Have you done the research?

3663
02:51:29,430 --> 02:51:30,540
Well,
I know a lot about time about.

3664
02:51:30,580 --> 02:51:32,560
I understand this standard,
I understand that,

3665
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:37,620
but he's right about little kids and 
Ritalin and I had a neighbor.

3666
02:51:37,621 --> 02:51:39,690
They drugged their kid up fucking 
Ritalin.

3667
02:51:39,691 --> 02:51:41,850
It was weird.
It was nothing wrong with the kid.

3668
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:44,470
He just had energy and the parents were 
working all the time.

3669
02:51:44,500 --> 02:51:46,680
They just didn't want to deal with it.
They put the kid on Ritalin.

3670
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:48,600
Terrible.
They were bad parents.

3671
02:51:48,630 --> 02:51:49,700
That's terrible.
It was.

3672
02:51:49,710 --> 02:51:51,120
I was watching it happen.
I was like,

3673
02:51:51,150 --> 02:51:52,320
whoa.
And then they.

3674
02:51:52,410 --> 02:51:53,243
They zone the kid out.
They got a monster shit and he was just 

3675
02:51:55,831 --> 02:51:56,664
like,
like a weird little Zombie kid after 

3676
02:51:57,871 --> 02:51:59,290
that.
Oh Man.

3677
02:51:59,310 --> 02:52:00,031
Say Hi to him.
He's like,

3678
02:52:00,031 --> 02:52:01,780
hi.
Oh my God,

3679
02:52:01,781 --> 02:52:02,880
that's terrible.
It was.

3680
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:05,040
We could have been an artist.
It could have been something great.

3681
02:52:05,070 --> 02:52:05,903
Right.
That's

3682
02:52:06,030 --> 02:52:06,863
taken away from him.
You put a kid in a classroom and you 

3683
02:52:08,531 --> 02:52:11,530
make them listen to boring shit all day.
They don't want to do it.

3684
02:52:11,531 --> 02:52:11,981
You think,
well,

3685
02:52:11,981 --> 02:52:13,780
there's something wrong with this child.
Yeah.

3686
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:15,110
Right.
No.

3687
02:52:15,110 --> 02:52:19,060
These kind of actually a free thinker.
He's actually gonna do some really cool.

3688
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:20,410
Yeah.
He's got energy.

3689
02:52:20,530 --> 02:52:22,540
Let them figure it out and do something 
great.

3690
02:52:22,570 --> 02:52:23,890
He's bouncing off the walls.
Yeah.

3691
02:52:23,980 --> 02:52:25,340
Let them go outside.
Yeah,

3692
02:52:25,420 --> 02:52:27,820
because he's not turning into a robot 
like the rest of the class,

3693
02:52:28,090 --> 02:52:29,560
but that's what we need.
We need robots.

3694
02:52:29,561 --> 02:52:32,980
We need workers.
What we can do with three d printers,

3695
02:52:33,890 --> 02:52:37,570
we can make them totally with human skin
around the outsides.

3696
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:38,913
They're going to ship the three d 
printers to Mars and have them make all 

3697
02:52:41,261 --> 02:52:44,050
the stuff we need on Mars right there.
You don't have to ship it.

3698
02:52:44,380 --> 02:52:47,620
Do you think in our lifetime someone's 
going to fly to Mars and live there?

3699
02:52:47,860 --> 02:52:48,970
Yes.
You're looking at him.

3700
02:52:52,270 --> 02:52:54,430
I've already told my family.
I might not come back,

3701
02:52:54,431 --> 02:52:56,920
but I'm going to be a pioneer.
Come back.

3702
02:52:56,950 --> 02:52:58,240
If you go there,
you're not coming back.

3703
02:52:58,241 --> 02:52:59,980
I know.
Die On Mars.

3704
02:53:00,040 --> 02:53:01,390
Pretty cool.
No,

3705
02:53:01,450 --> 02:53:04,150
you won't be able to do sets up there.
Yeah,

3706
02:53:04,151 --> 02:53:04,984
I will.
Because by then is going to be all 

3707
02:53:06,011 --> 02:53:06,844
holograms,
so you'll be able to like beam you into 

3708
02:53:08,981 --> 02:53:10,060
a room.
Yeah.

3709
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:12,340
It will be made at the comedy store 
doing a late night set,

3710
02:53:12,341 --> 02:53:14,800
but ours.
Is that good enough?

3711
02:53:14,890 --> 02:53:15,890
No,
you don't.

3712
02:53:16,270 --> 02:53:18,280
For us,
we won't feel a log.

3713
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:20,770
You won't feel it.
It's an analog experience.

3714
02:53:20,830 --> 02:53:24,460
Yeah.
There's no energy transfer yet.

3715
02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:26,710
Think someday.
Yeah.

3716
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:28,990
They're going to harness your energy.
It will be that good.

3717
02:53:30,670 --> 02:53:32,680
You think you'd be able to bang people 
weren't there?

3718
02:53:33,250 --> 02:53:34,083
Yeah.
I'm going to make them with my three d 

3719
02:53:34,631 --> 02:53:38,980
printer with human cells and then bang 
them.

3720
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:42,500
We're setting up.
This is why I made you pay.

3721
02:53:44,870 --> 02:53:45,430
Well,
that's.

3722
02:53:45,430 --> 02:53:46,750
That's an interesting question.
Right?

3723
02:53:47,270 --> 02:53:48,103
There's people that are.
They're considering the ethical 

3724
02:53:50,321 --> 02:53:51,154
implications of making a headless person
that you would harvest your organs for 

3725
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:55,553
like say right.
If Tom Papa decides I'm going to make a 

3726
02:53:57,431 --> 02:53:58,264
headless Tom Papa and I'm just going to 
drink like a fish and scoop the and 

3727
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:05,500
liver out of this asshole sticking into 
my body.

3728
02:54:06,070 --> 02:54:08,590
It was pretty cool.
It was great.

3729
02:54:08,591 --> 02:54:09,160
Yeah.
It.

3730
02:54:09,160 --> 02:54:11,740
Your grandpa needs a liver and you want 
to keep grandpa live,

3731
02:54:11,741 --> 02:54:13,390
harness all those parts.
Yeah,

3732
02:54:13,810 --> 02:54:17,200
but what are the.
What's the ethical considerations?

3733
02:54:17,560 --> 02:54:19,900
Someone just told me that there's.
If you need a part,

3734
02:54:19,930 --> 02:54:24,490
if you need an organ or something,
you go to the states that have no helmet

3735
02:54:24,491 --> 02:54:26,220
laws.
Jesus.

3736
02:54:26,890 --> 02:54:30,460
How crazy is that?
I was just in Chicago.

3737
02:54:30,670 --> 02:54:32,740
Chicago doesn't have helmet laws.
Oh really?

3738
02:54:32,760 --> 02:54:34,450
Dude.
Watch these people running the highway,

3739
02:54:35,680 --> 02:54:36,513
but you know when it goes to your liver 
at home and then in Chicago they don't 

3740
02:54:39,701 --> 02:54:40,534
have helmet laws but they can't split 
lanes right at home and these fucking 

3741
02:54:44,651 --> 02:54:49,330
guys are just driving right next to cars
whizzing in between lanes and I'm like,

3742
02:54:49,660 --> 02:54:51,040
what's more dangerous?

3743
02:54:51,190 --> 02:54:54,760
Is splitting lanes more dangerous or is 
it riding around with no helmet?

3744
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:56,590
No.
Scary though.

3745
02:54:56,650 --> 02:54:59,200
Both of them.
Have you ever ridden a motorcycle?

3746
02:54:59,230 --> 02:55:00,760
Yeah,
for years,

3747
02:55:01,090 --> 02:55:02,510
like 15 years?
Yeah.

3748
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,120
So my kids were born.
Yeah.

3749
02:55:05,121 --> 02:55:06,770
I went around the whole country on my 
bike,

3750
02:55:07,370 --> 02:55:09,380
my wife and I on the back for five 
weeks.

3751
02:55:09,410 --> 02:55:11,190
Wow.
Did we talk about this?

3752
02:55:11,700 --> 02:55:14,260
I think we must have.
It's one of my big story.

3753
02:55:14,360 --> 02:55:18,170
I remember you saying that.
I do miss it.

3754
02:55:18,610 --> 02:55:20,570
Like I see bike.
I've been looking at it more.

3755
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:22,093
Would you emote a glitzy had like say if
you had a summer house in big bear or 

3756
02:55:27,350 --> 02:55:30,230
something like that or a main.
Nobody up there.

3757
02:55:30,231 --> 02:55:33,080
You just drive around,
get a nice bike up there that I would do

3758
02:55:33,081 --> 02:55:35,480
that in a slow.
I would do that.

3759
02:55:36,610 --> 02:55:38,240
I got to get a house freedom.

3760
02:55:40,280 --> 02:55:42,500
I love it.
You're so focused because you don't want

3761
02:55:42,501 --> 02:55:43,334
to die.
It's one of those things that you're 

3762
02:55:44,061 --> 02:55:44,894
just so focused on.
You forget about the whole rest of the 

3763
02:55:46,251 --> 02:55:49,400
world locked in a.
it's so nice to sound good.

3764
02:55:49,430 --> 02:55:51,410
I know I've been looking at bikes 
lately,

3765
02:55:51,470 --> 02:55:53,720
but you see people that get fucked up.
Our bikes,

3766
02:55:53,721 --> 02:55:55,370
it's not good now.
Especially here.

3767
02:55:55,371 --> 02:55:58,100
I know you don't listen to the radio,
but if you do out here,

3768
02:55:58,101 --> 02:56:00,710
you hear about radio a motorcycle 
accidents.

3769
02:56:00,750 --> 02:56:04,760
Like everyday there's traffic on the 
five.

3770
02:56:04,761 --> 02:56:09,761
There was a motorcycle accident.
I know because it's music.

3771
02:56:10,670 --> 02:56:12,650
That's what you.
Let's do well on the radio.

3772
02:56:12,680 --> 02:56:13,513
Well,
they break in once in awhile and say 

3773
02:56:15,201 --> 02:56:19,010
there's an accident or something.
If I'm not listening to the Sirius Xm or

3774
02:56:19,011 --> 02:56:21,530
podcasts,
or you listen to Sirius,

3775
02:56:21,910 --> 02:56:22,743
what do you listening to?
Sometimes they'll listen to comedians 

3776
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:27,140
sometimes listen to the news.

3777
02:56:27,290 --> 02:56:30,440
I have a Sinatra station,
a coal train station.

3778
02:56:30,660 --> 02:56:32,730
Oh,
um,

3779
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:35,030
yeah.
Music.

3780
02:56:35,420 --> 02:56:37,340
You know,
I'm a hip dad.

3781
02:56:37,700 --> 02:56:39,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

3782
02:56:39,290 --> 02:56:40,760
Do you think your kids think your hip 
dad?

3783
02:56:40,890 --> 02:56:41,750
No.
No.

3784
02:56:42,090 --> 02:56:44,270
Humiliate.
Totally.

3785
02:56:44,650 --> 02:56:47,120
Just how it's always going to be.
Which is cool.

3786
02:56:47,121 --> 02:56:47,954
They liked that.
They liked knowing that the door is 

3787
02:56:49,101 --> 02:56:50,260
there and he loves them.
Yeah.

3788
02:56:50,460 --> 02:56:52,010
That's the whole key.
You're stupid.

3789
02:56:52,670 --> 02:56:54,530
Don't you love making your kids laugh?
Oh yeah.

3790
02:56:54,590 --> 02:56:55,850
Oh,
it's the best fun.

3791
02:56:55,910 --> 02:56:57,530
A lot of dads can't make their kids 
laugh.

3792
02:56:57,890 --> 02:56:59,000
Really?
Yes.

3793
02:56:59,270 --> 02:57:00,103
They can make them laugh in a goofy way,
but when you can make them laugh in a 

3794
02:57:01,911 --> 02:57:04,880
way that you know is really funny.
That's like,

3795
02:57:04,910 --> 02:57:07,460
you know,
my youngest standup up funny.

3796
02:57:07,820 --> 02:57:12,290
My youngest is fucking fun.
She's really into it too.

3797
02:57:12,320 --> 02:57:14,870
She's really into saying funny shapes.
Got good timing.

3798
02:57:14,960 --> 02:57:16,280
It's good.
It's funny.

3799
02:57:16,281 --> 02:57:16,850
My little ones.

3800
02:57:16,850 --> 02:57:17,810
Those same way.
Yeah.

3801
02:57:17,811 --> 02:57:18,644
Well,
they realized that's how they get 

3802
02:57:18,861 --> 02:57:19,940
attention.
Yeah.

3803
02:57:19,970 --> 02:57:21,250
You,
your y's assets.

3804
02:57:21,290 --> 02:57:22,310
Yeah.
You say something.

3805
02:57:22,610 --> 02:57:25,580
They say something funny.
Everybody laughs and they're like,

3806
02:57:25,581 --> 02:57:26,450
whoa.
That felt good.

3807
02:57:26,451 --> 02:57:28,100
Yeah,
it gives them a little charge.

3808
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:29,600
And what's funny too is,
uh,

3809
02:57:30,020 --> 02:57:32,310
probably the same thing that she has 
mine has,

3810
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:37,320
is that they're not doing it for you.
They're doing it purely for them to mock

3811
02:57:37,560 --> 02:57:39,950
you.
They victimize you.

3812
02:57:40,640 --> 02:57:43,220
Yeah.
Your mock you.

3813
02:57:43,310 --> 02:57:44,143
What's it like being old and mock you?
They'll have to mark the fact that I'm 

3814
02:57:48,771 --> 02:57:51,890
bald.
I know they mock that.

3815
02:57:51,891 --> 02:57:54,700
I can't see any glasses.
Yeah.

3816
02:57:57,620 --> 02:57:58,453
Daddy's eyes were fading.
Watching me to use a cell phone and not 

3817
02:58:01,741 --> 02:58:05,040
be able to navigate.
Just Dad just give it to me.

3818
02:58:05,100 --> 02:58:05,933
Oh,
they know how to use electronics in a 

3819
02:58:06,871 --> 02:58:07,920
weird way.
Oh,

3820
02:58:08,150 --> 02:58:08,983
look to it.
Like they know how to edit videos and 

3821
02:58:11,461 --> 02:58:12,001
shit like that.
I'm like,

3822
02:58:12,001 --> 02:58:13,510
how do you know how to do that?
Like,

3823
02:58:13,511 --> 02:58:14,344
and then they don't even have a phone 
completely feel like using my wife's 

3824
02:58:16,621 --> 02:58:18,110
phone and they're making videos 
mccullough.

3825
02:58:18,180 --> 02:58:19,500
Fuck.
Did you know how to do that?

3826
02:58:19,501 --> 02:58:21,630
This is a little video editor.
Programs and shit,

3827
02:58:21,710 --> 02:58:24,750
cause I have a young brain,
I can learn things very quickly,

3828
02:58:24,780 --> 02:58:26,670
very quickly.
Eyesight is killer.

3829
02:58:26,850 --> 02:58:29,760
I can learn things quickly.
I say killer is a big deal,

3830
02:58:29,761 --> 02:58:30,780
but I think it's uh,
the,

3831
02:58:30,790 --> 02:58:33,150
the brain is so plastic.
Yeah.

3832
02:58:33,220 --> 02:58:36,420
The mental plasticity is just,
they just,

3833
02:58:36,810 --> 02:58:37,720
they figured out,
oh yeah,

3834
02:58:37,721 --> 02:58:38,460
you swipe right.

3835
02:58:38,460 --> 02:58:39,293
Oh you do that.
And then you highlight that and he 

3836
02:58:40,011 --> 02:58:42,570
spread this out and touch that and edit.
You don't want that.

3837
02:58:42,571 --> 02:58:44,100
You want to filter so you go down to the
bottom.

3838
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:46,000
I always.
My kids were uh,

3839
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:46,853
with my wife at a party,
at a relatives when I got home 

3840
02:58:49,381 --> 02:58:50,214
yesterday,
they weren't there and I facetime with 

3841
02:58:51,991 --> 02:58:52,824
my daughter.
I said,

3842
02:58:52,870 --> 02:58:54,620
how's mom doing it?
And she was bored at the party.

3843
02:58:54,670 --> 02:58:55,560
She's like,
how's mom?

3844
02:58:55,620 --> 02:58:57,120
I said,
how's my doing at the party?

3845
02:58:57,121 --> 02:58:58,950
She's like,
she's doing okay.

3846
02:58:58,951 --> 02:58:59,784
She's inside.
She's her to repeat a couple stories a 

3847
02:59:02,011 --> 02:59:04,020
couple times,
but she seems to be having fun.

3848
02:59:12,020 --> 02:59:16,080
They're all over us.
One day there'll be us.

3849
02:59:16,230 --> 02:59:17,280
Yeah,
it's great.

3850
02:59:17,281 --> 02:59:20,400
We'll be their version of US raising 
their own kid going,

3851
02:59:20,401 --> 02:59:21,234
what the fuck?
I've got kids now and you'll be like 

3852
02:59:22,561 --> 02:59:26,370
with this new baby that they made kids 
cute hair.

3853
02:59:26,371 --> 02:59:29,820
Take them fishing responsibilities 
anymore.

3854
02:59:31,050 --> 02:59:31,883
Let me have a little kiss.
Let me get some sugar for that baby 

3855
02:59:33,331 --> 02:59:34,260
cheek.
Now I'm out.

3856
02:59:34,261 --> 02:59:35,320
Bye.
Good luck.

3857
02:59:35,480 --> 02:59:36,840
Changing the diapers.
A uh,

3858
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:39,530
can I babysit Friday night?
No,

3859
02:59:39,590 --> 02:59:40,980
no.
That's for you.

3860
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:41,873
I'm working.
Do you think you'd be working to the 

3861
02:59:45,390 --> 02:59:46,980
bitter end?
To the end?

3862
02:59:48,030 --> 02:59:48,863
There's no part.
When I hear people say that they're 

3863
02:59:50,761 --> 02:59:53,760
going to retire,
like anybody just in the world and say,

3864
02:59:53,810 --> 02:59:56,490
I here retirement.
I know that's one thing.

3865
02:59:56,491 --> 02:59:59,940
I'm not doing bright.
There's no why.

3866
03:00:00,050 --> 03:00:02,550
Why would you retire?
I want to make stuff until I go.

3867
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:06,990
I want to put out stuff and see what 
that stuff will be later on.

3868
03:00:07,020 --> 03:00:08,250
Who knows?
Well,

3869
03:00:08,251 --> 03:00:09,084
it's also,
you've chosen a path that it's just 

3870
03:00:11,250 --> 03:00:14,190
perfect for you.
You actually,

3871
03:00:14,430 --> 03:00:16,410
you're not working because you have to 
go to work.

3872
03:00:16,470 --> 03:00:18,840
You're working because you enjoy what 
you do,

3873
03:00:19,140 --> 03:00:23,610
which is really what I encourage 
everyone to try to attempt to do this,

3874
03:00:23,611 --> 03:00:24,444
this,
this thing that we're taught in school 

3875
03:00:26,581 --> 03:00:29,460
to try to find a good job that pays 
well.

3876
03:00:29,550 --> 03:00:32,700
That's wonderful advice,
but it's not the best advice.

3877
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:33,953
The best advice is try to find the thing
that you love to do because if you can 

3878
03:00:37,921 --> 03:00:38,754
do that,
then you never have that feeling that 

3879
03:00:41,371 --> 03:00:44,610
most people have when it comes to work.
Most people have that feeling like,

3880
03:00:44,700 --> 03:00:46,290
oh,
I've got to go to work.

3881
03:00:46,291 --> 03:00:47,730
Right?
You never had that.

3882
03:00:47,760 --> 03:00:50,010
Never.
But that's also,

3883
03:00:50,220 --> 03:00:51,053
I think,
uh,

3884
03:00:51,300 --> 03:00:54,270
there's some luck involved in that for 
sure.

3885
03:00:54,690 --> 03:00:59,690
There's also decisions you make if you 
don't have that luck to try to make that

3886
03:00:59,711 --> 03:01:00,544
luck happen.

3887
03:01:00,580 --> 03:01:01,301
Yeah.
You know,

3888
03:01:01,301 --> 03:01:03,340
and then there's also,
talent is also like,

3889
03:01:03,341 --> 03:01:06,520
some people want to be a comedian and 
they really would never will be.

3890
03:01:06,750 --> 03:01:07,583
You just can't.
I think being self aware of what you 

3891
03:01:10,031 --> 03:01:12,940
really,
really want to do as the person,

3892
03:01:13,750 --> 03:01:15,640
not thinking of it even in terms of 
work,

3893
03:01:15,641 --> 03:01:16,474
just but being looking at yourself 
enough to know what you're good at and 

3894
03:01:20,771 --> 03:01:22,450
what you enjoy,
right,

3895
03:01:22,900 --> 03:01:25,720
and then follow that path.
Whether it makes business sense or not,

3896
03:01:26,140 --> 03:01:30,280
that's the best thing you can do.
You don't know where it's going to leave

3897
03:01:30,281 --> 03:01:31,870
it.
At least you're heading in the direction

3898
03:01:31,871 --> 03:01:35,920
where it's stuff you like and it's stuff
you know you have an aptitude for,

3899
03:01:36,220 --> 03:01:40,450
so wherever you end up in that area will
be pretty close to happiness.

3900
03:01:41,110 --> 03:01:43,570
You know,
words of wisdom from Tom,

3901
03:01:43,571 --> 03:01:44,800
Papa,
author,

3902
03:01:45,610 --> 03:01:48,130
your dad stole my rake available.

3903
03:01:48,130 --> 03:01:49,330
Now,
is it an audio version?

3904
03:01:49,420 --> 03:01:52,540
There's an audio version too.
Did you use your voice?

3905
03:01:52,630 --> 03:01:55,210
Nine hours,
nine hours in a big God.

3906
03:01:55,211 --> 03:01:57,320
You did though.
Reading my book some for.

3907
03:01:57,370 --> 03:02:00,700
I read a lot of books on tape or I have 
a lot of books written read.

3908
03:02:00,701 --> 03:02:01,534
To me,
the real problem is when you know that 

3909
03:02:03,521 --> 03:02:04,354
it's not the author and you hear someone
have some sort of bullshit halfass 

3910
03:02:08,020 --> 03:02:11,160
connection to the words they're saying,
now I know I'm good.

3911
03:02:11,380 --> 03:02:15,150
That's why it was hard to do actually 
because it's nine hours of reading me.

3912
03:02:15,170 --> 03:02:19,420
I've got to read a whole book,
but also I have to be me behind it.

3913
03:02:19,421 --> 03:02:20,254
I got I wanna you know,
they don't want me doing a phone 

3914
03:02:22,091 --> 03:02:22,924
inversion.
How many hours at a time did you do 

3915
03:02:24,401 --> 03:02:25,750
these sessions?
Broken into two,

3916
03:02:25,900 --> 03:02:27,520
so like four and a half each day.

3917
03:02:27,780 --> 03:02:29,200
It's hard.
It's hard to do,

3918
03:02:29,340 --> 03:02:30,173
to stay on point for that long.
It was a thing like when you get out of 

3919
03:02:32,621 --> 03:02:33,550
there,
but also,

3920
03:02:33,551 --> 03:02:37,000
you know when you go in those booths,
like even in this show,

3921
03:02:37,001 --> 03:02:40,570
like times different here,
it's different here than three hours.

3922
03:02:40,571 --> 03:02:42,130
Somewhere else.
Three hours is up.

3923
03:02:42,280 --> 03:02:43,840
We did three hours.
See?

3924
03:02:43,930 --> 03:02:44,950
See,
there you go.

3925
03:02:44,980 --> 03:02:45,940
Crazy.
Exactly.

3926
03:02:45,941 --> 03:02:46,750
It's different.
You.

3927
03:02:46,750 --> 03:02:48,640
There's something going on with the 
timing.

3928
03:02:48,790 --> 03:02:49,623
You're engaged.
It's not like three hours out in the 

3929
03:02:51,641 --> 03:02:53,830
world,
you know timewarp.

3930
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:55,360
Yeah.
It's a total time warp.

3931
03:02:55,610 --> 03:02:57,760
Yeah.
It's whenever,

3932
03:02:57,790 --> 03:03:01,720
whenever I say I'm doing this show is 
people who he us like three hours.

3933
03:03:01,780 --> 03:03:02,613
I'm like,
that's not a thing it's doing with you 

3934
03:03:05,861 --> 03:03:07,390
and I,
you just doing the show.

3935
03:03:07,450 --> 03:03:08,890
Believe me.
It's a thing with some people.

3936
03:03:08,891 --> 03:03:10,530
Some people you just squeezing blood out
of.

3937
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:16,120
You know?
I could do this for four hours.

3938
03:03:16,140 --> 03:03:17,080
Easy,
easy,

3939
03:03:17,190 --> 03:03:21,190
easy,
easy to show your beautiful man.

3940
03:03:21,250 --> 03:03:21,971
You too,
man.

3941
03:03:21,971 --> 03:03:23,770
I'm sure your book's hilarious.
Although I haven't read it.

3942
03:03:23,800 --> 03:03:27,110
It's a great father's Day gift for you.
I'm giving it to you.

3943
03:03:27,140 --> 03:03:27,973
Thank you.
Because you don't get gifts from your 

3944
03:03:29,261 --> 03:03:30,320
family time,
Papa,

3945
03:03:30,330 --> 03:03:32,160
ladies and gentlemen.
Sale.

3946
03:03:35,910 --> 03:03:36,743
We did it.
