Let them bitches know.

27
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,130
Is this the video over
the traffic one screen?

28
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,983
Look how bad I am.

29
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,610
I can't deal with this
shit at seven 30 at night.

30
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,120
Oh fuck around though.

31
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,521
Hello everybody.

32
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:00,470
I'm here with my friend
are we should fear.

33
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,071
Hi Guys.

34
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:01,700
I'm always fair.

35
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,370
That is just referencing our,

36
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,740
the spirit just got back from a
tour of Canada the whole month.

37
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,550
Ottawa,

38
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,570
I saw black keys.

39
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,040
Did you see Blackie's lines?

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,210
They delayed for like an hour
because the rain is okay.

41
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,940
Did you see that thing with the um,

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,833
the stage Phil?

43
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,590
No.

44
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,690
They just have this thing in Ottawa.

45
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,140
The week after I fell and cheap trick.

46
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,580
The whole stage just collapsed.

47
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,170
It was that same stage of
shut it down for an hour.

48
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:21,821
A bunch of people left,

49
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:22,820
but I wasn't gonna fucking leave.

50
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,790
And they came on an hour late and
played for like wait over curfew.

51
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,983
Wow.

52
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,580
How many people were left still?

53
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,270
How many people stay?

54
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,710
I'd say probably 60 70% of them.

55
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,301
Wow.

56
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,950
And it's just pulling it
out on stage the next day.

57
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:34,191
I was like,

58
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:35,210
how many guys left for the black?

59
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,040
He's thinking it was canceled and people,

60
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,480
they class might kill yourself.

61
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,553
Kill yourself.

62
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,571
The black keys.

63
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:41,770
And one of my favorite new bands,

64
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:42,011
man,

65
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,060
they're fucking amazing.

66
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,043
They're amazing.

67
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,680
They're sold throwback.

68
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,743
She know.

69
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,820
What about with cars?

70
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,300
Like,

71
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,620
I love a fucking car.

72
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:51,790
We heal real engine.

73
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,680
You're fucking bar.

74
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,680
That's a black users harmonics
to it as a sound to it.

75
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:57,514
It's just like,

76
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,970
it's a real fucking analog music man.

77
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,230
It's real music.

78
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,921
Just two guys,

79
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:03,754
really.

80
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,070
Just two people here or there.

81
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,310
There's so bad ass.

82
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,020
It's sad.

83
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,950
But at the end of the festival,

84
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,250
uh,

85
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:09,970
Jeff Ross,

86
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,790
Brandon's with the lead singer from the
flaming lips just randomly in the street

87
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,320
and then knew each other and
bond a room and he's like,

88
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:16,630
you should come to my insurance
tomorrow and we're going to leave.

89
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,930
We're just stash a day and just
fucking see this concert backstage.

90
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,910
It was the best concert I've ever been to.

91
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,270
It was all love and beautiful lights
and colors and it was so fucking gray

92
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,180
called the flaming lips.

93
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:27,731
Flaming Lips.

94
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,030
Yeah.

95
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,050
What kind of music is it?

96
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:29,581
Yeah,

97
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:29,761
no,

98
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:30,270
that song,

99
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,730
they don't buy Jelly Harley's easy,

100
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,280
like 10 Jermaine's.

101
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,280
Wow.

102
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,880
It's all rock.

103
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,850
I guess open.

104
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,040
They've been around for 20 years.

105
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,420
That's almost 17 years ago.

106
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,390
That's when that came out and
it's just so fucking awesome.

107
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,190
I was bawling like three or four times.

108
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:46,110
Not on anything.

109
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:46,980
Yeah,

110
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,670
you're crying.

111
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,600
It was so beautiful

112
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,670
at this fucking guy,

113
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,081
or hey,

114
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:52,914
don't be afraid.

115
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,510
Becoming a very different personal,

116
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,100
maybe it's much you're,

117
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:59,090
you're very different person.

118
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,900
When I met you,

119
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,130
you're

120
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,240
much more thankful.

121
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,880
I just talking about energy and Karma
and you used to think it was all horse

122
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,600
shit,

123
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:04,961
but you've,

124
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:05,171
uh,

125
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,070
you've kind of changed your tune
and all that and you're like,

126
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,990
the idea that other people's experiences
in life might be true even if it's not

127
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:11,824
from it.

128
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,880
Hmm.

129
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,530
Is that what it is?

130
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,221
There's a lot of that.

131
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:15,880
And also like,

132
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,091
you know,

133
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:16,930
other things are out there.

134
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,250
I started seeing it.

135
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,930
Sometimes there's just like,

136
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,291
it's easy.

137
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:20,660
You can be,

138
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,040
you can,

139
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,960
you can cut somebody off in
traffic and not let him in.

140
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,771
That's my thing.

141
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:23,920
Like,

142
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,131
Oh,

143
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:24,941
I fucked that guy over.

144
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:28,360
Or it's almost harder to fucking
fit somebody in sometimes.

145
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,470
And you're like,

146
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,800
all right,

147
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,371
I could do,

148
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,181
I could fuck you over.

149
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,014
But what does that good?

150
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,910
But that doesn't make me feel good.

151
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,380
It makes you feel good
to let people in it.

152
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:35,880
Yeah,

153
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,130
sure.

154
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,660
If you feel good to see
this fucking wedding.

155
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,710
I'm not even into marriages,

156
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,780
but they had his wedding onstage,

157
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,773
live onstage,

158
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,250
and I got the lead singer,

159
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:42,701
Wayne Coyne.

160
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,810
He's just so fucking into it.

161
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:47,770
He's like by the power of the flaming
lips and I got to husband and wife and

162
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,330
then I got really
married right afterwards.

163
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,800
They got just as a piece right there.

164
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:50,981
Oh,

165
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,630
that's hilarious.

166
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:51,790
Yeah,

167
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,290
and he's fucking loving
it and watching it.

168
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:56,440
Then he gets this idea to go get the
heads is one of those guns that shoot off

169
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,603
confetti,

170
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,160
so he goes and runs behind him waiting
for them to get married and the shoots it

171
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,540
off and wow.

172
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,170
This guy,

173
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,820
after it gets finished
playing an hour and a half,

174
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,661
I'm sorry,

175
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:04,931
I just,

176
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,490
I'm changed by this fucker concert.

177
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,690
Really people,

178
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:11,810
these girls dancing and like Dorothy
outfits and these boys dancing in a

179
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,180
scarecrow tin man.

180
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,640
Lion affects just sort of
dancing and having fun.

181
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,990
US both sides of the stage.

182
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,440
Afterwards they get out of their costumes,

183
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:19,930
take that.

184
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,590
I write about clothes.

185
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,940
These are people he picks
up from the audience.

186
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,480
Right.

187
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,430
He talks to each one of
them signs a teacher.

188
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,290
We're going to talk to each
stuff for like 10 minutes.

189
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,040
He spent another hour and a half to
two hours just talking these people who

190
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,530
helped him out by dancing onstage.

191
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,503
Oh that's cool.

192
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,100
And it says like,

193
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,671
thanks guys,

194
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:34,210
have a good night.

195
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,720
Which anyone would do right.

196
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,670
It's just,

197
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,360
I don't know.

198
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,800
I'm going to see them
every time they're here.

199
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,270
It's an amazing concert.

200
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,343
That's cool man.

201
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:41,790
What,

202
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,251
what is,

203
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:45,190
what turns you around and made you
this real super positive person?

204
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,560
Cause you depression was a lot of it.

205
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Really good depression.

206
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,700
Now that helps a lot because
just sort of sitting like,

207
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:52,900
what's gonna make me happy?

208
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,540
I don't care about things
I'm supposed to care about.

209
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,021
It's just like,

210
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,460
what's going to make
me feel good right now?

211
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,110
We'll talking somebody overdosing.

212
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,150
It's hard being a comedian man.

213
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,450
Um,

214
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:01,680
in,

215
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,040
in that sense that you,

216
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,790
you know,

217
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,030
you,

218
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,590
you kind of are on your own.

219
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,200
You know,

220
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,940
you're kind of making your
own destiny and you kind of,

221
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,670
you know,

222
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,050
you don't have to think and behave the
way everybody in the office does cause

223
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:15,150
there is no fucking office.

224
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,010
You're kind of out there
trying to sort out what is,

225
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,750
what is acceptable
because so many of what,

226
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,640
so much of what we think of as acceptable,

227
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:22,480
it's just patterns.

228
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,870
Everybody just follows the pattern.

229
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,630
That's what's supposed to make you happy.

230
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,600
You have a beer at the ballgame that
doesn't make you happy while you're fuck

231
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,380
good luck.

232
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,290
But yeah,

233
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,350
we'll do something else
that makes you happy.

234
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,070
So,

235
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,060
so yeah,

236
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,170
they have no idea what the rest made you
just really focus on what the fuck it

237
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:38,951
is that I like,

238
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:40,330
not what everybody wants me to like,

239
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,193
but what do I like?

240
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,020
And it's like if someone's going to
think I'm an asshole for doing this,

241
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:45,780
somebody's going to think I'm
weak for doing whatever it is.

242
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,990
Like that's cool.

243
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,980
I don't care.

244
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,930
I just care about making me happy.

245
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,930
They used to even joke around about on
stage about being a terrible person and I

246
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:53,320
was like,

247
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,420
I don't like that job because
you're not a terrible person.

248
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,490
I used to say like you're just kind
of playing it up to make it seem,

249
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,090
make more sense to stay a joke.

250
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,710
It's terrible person.

251
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,920
Some of it too was like,

252
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,710
I feel like a terrible person when I
do these few things because I'm a good

253
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:09,290
person so I feel horrible about
a few things you might do.

254
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,040
Right.

255
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,260
But even then terrible things.

256
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,820
They were never terrible things.

257
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,381
It was,

258
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,400
it was just a sort of a method to get
to the list to call yourself a terrible

259
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,000
person,

260
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,490
but you gotta always be
careful about that audience.

261
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,900
People go to have a good time.

262
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,850
They don't want to think they're
having a good time with this terrible

263
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:26,684
conscious,

264
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,120
just dealing as fucking evil venom.

265
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,710
So it was great photos and then my thrive.

266
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,020
Why closing in on me man,

267
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,740
I'm trying to thing I know
it's fucking mad cause

268
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,310
beautiful things about the podcasts
that we have with Dunkin is,

269
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,530
well even if we cover the same ground we,

270
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,750
it's always differently.

271
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,610
Never run out of shit to talk about.

272
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,630
There's always something,

273
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,550
you know there's always
something to talk about.

274
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,393
Yeah,

275
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,740
totally man.

276
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I'd always get as it goes to crazy places
and that never happens anywhere else.

277
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,800
Yeah,

278
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,680
and you know there's something that went
on today that I have been meaning to

279
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:01,131
tell you,

280
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:05,450
but I never brought it up to you before
and how much you've evolved since you've

281
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,490
had like this real
serious relationship now.

282
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,420
It's really interesting.

283
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,270
It's really interesting
because like he like,

284
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,691
you know,

285
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:15,290
when you're around a person and they're
in this constant state of turmoil and

286
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,350
doubt and then all of a sudden
a big chunk of their life,

287
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:18,550
you know,

288
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,850
who you spend your time with,

289
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:20,301
who's your,

290
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,320
your love interest,

291
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:21,890
who is,

292
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,620
who's your confidant and I'll send,

293
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:25,460
and that's been established
and the good way,

294
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,460
it's like you're so free
and all these other areas,

295
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,850
you're free to look at things
a little more discerning eye.

296
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,390
Right.

297
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:31,821
You know,

298
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:35,530
and you have really found
your voice I think in,

299
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,140
you know,

300
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,060
since that it's real interesting.

301
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,690
Thanks man.

302
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,523
That's really cool.

303
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,970
It's really interesting to watch.

304
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,540
I mean,

305
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,930
because I mean we've been
friends for a long time and like,

306
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:45,150
you know,

307
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,150
everybody has relationship issues,

308
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,500
but you were overage
critically disturbed by them.

309
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,760
Like you would have them
and you could sell it.

310
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:55,700
You could tell it was just like crushing.

311
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:56,534
You just couldn't,

312
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,021
you know,

313
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:57,740
so it was,

314
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,400
it's so hard to get over and
then see the big picture.

315
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,630
You know when,

316
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,770
especially when you know someone breaks
up with you or you know you thought it

317
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:07,431
was going to work out in,

318
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:08,300
that falls apart.

319
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,560
You blame yourself.

320
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:13,760
It's like fuck so hard to
like come into your own.

321
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,140
If you're alone,

322
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,060
you know that's true,

323
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,530
but you aren't from that staff man.

324
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,080
It's good to get completely
disintegrated from time to time.

325
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,591
Sure.

326
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:24,500
And then by the time you actually
find someone that you really truly are

327
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,334
compatible with,

328
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,200
you have a character,

329
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:30,170
you've gone through a bunch of different
things and you understand the cause and

330
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:30,620
effect.

331
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,630
You understand the early warning signs.

332
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,823
You don't understand.

333
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,361
You know when,

334
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:35,330
when the relationship going on,

335
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:36,260
what am I being a deck?

336
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,480
Am I trying to push her away because I
don't want to hang out with her anymore?

337
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,740
What's really going on here?

338
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,283
You know you,

339
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,490
once you get through that man,

340
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,150
it's very interesting but you've,

341
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,210
you,

342
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,290
you will always hilarious but
you've really come into your own.

343
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,850
I'll be like these last three years.

344
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,133
Thanks man.

345
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,790
So really cool to watch.

346
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,590
She actually broke out this morning.

347
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,640
[inaudible]

348
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,010
if you guys kill yourself,

349
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,270
they say pills.

350
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:03,931
Yeah,

351
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:07,320
I've heard that I say or
electric fence either or both.

352
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,850
It was a guy who just passed away.

353
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,490
His name is Sean Thompson's,

354
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,670
who's a really nice car man.

355
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:11,920
Jose,

356
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,720
a kickboxing training for a lot of fives.

357
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,571
Real wild dude.

358
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:19,850
Real Fun guy from Canada boss route
and discipling a 37 years old man.

359
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,020
Just die and asleep.

360
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,820
How never worked on a heart attack.

361
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,710
Supposedly that's the latest information.

362
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:26,850
Clogged artery or something.

363
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,301
Who knows?

364
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:27,481
You know,

365
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,510
it could be some congenital
thing that you just didn't know.

366
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,420
He wasn't aware of it.

367
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,411
I'm really crazy.

368
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:31,980
But uh,

369
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,813
he was a great guy.

370
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,920
So a rusted piece.

371
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,113
Sean,

372
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,943
are we rolling?

373
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,880
Ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,650
I'm here with Neal.

375
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,890
Brent and I just got
done doing the pop Kia.

376
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,050
I've known Neil for a long time.

377
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,013
Long ago.

378
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,810
Uh,

379
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,160
she had 92 to 90 men at the
Boston Comedy Club and uh,

380
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,881
pretty no one.

381
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:57,780
I only used to think about you that
you would be a good action moving here.

382
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,511
I really did.

383
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:01,690
I don't like when I
didn't see you for awhile.

384
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,580
Like between the Boston and new,

385
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,381
even when you were on news,

386
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:05,990
Raina was,

387
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,100
he could always reminding
me of Bruce Willis,

388
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,470
but I feel like,

389
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:11,870
uh,

390
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,290
they,

391
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:12,820
um,

392
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,000
wait,

393
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,221
look,

394
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:16,160
you want a different balding
with bad relationship choices.

395
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:16,600
Yeah.

396
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,433
Uh,

397
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,620
um,

398
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:18,921
but,

399
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:19,100
uh,

400
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,281
yeah,

401
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:24,281
I always felt like we could've been in
action guys that I saw that I thought he

402
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:27,770
could be something and
you didn't become that.

403
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,080
I don't know what that means,

404
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,030
but I have pretty good
instincts about like,

405
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,010
I think he could be like a thing.

406
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,510
And then you,

407
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,560
you betrayed me.

408
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,753
I'm very sorry.

409
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,540
Um,

410
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:39,781
yeah.

411
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:41,700
I would've never thought it would
become a sports broadcaster.

412
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,593
That's the weirdest one.

413
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,380
Yeah.

414
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,690
No,

415
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,670
I never saw coming.

416
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,280
Did you ever go in for,

417
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:47,840
did anyone ever consider
you for an action movie?

418
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:48,430
Did you ever do like

419
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,640
it's shitty one and to have a meeting
with people when they were doing,

420
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,000
they were looking for the next Steven
Seagal and Steven scope became famous.

421
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,510
This is before I had done anything and
I was living in New York and I went in

422
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:00,910
for this meeting and the guy
was just like Super Douchey,

423
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,010
like his attitude about martial arts.

424
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,260
I just remember thinking
I wanted to kick his ass.

425
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,310
It was just really Dickey and it's like,

426
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:10,900
like so tell me why should we be like you?

427
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:11,471
Literally it was like,

428
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,370
well it was high blood moon,

429
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,080
so tell me why should
we tell him with you?

430
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,561
I go,

431
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:14,861
wow,

432
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:15,940
is that really how we do this?

433
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,081
This is what really what?

434
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:18,430
I said like that's really how you talk.

435
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:19,470
You kick back and he goes,

436
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,340
so tell me how should
we do a move with you?

437
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,200
Why should we do a movie with you?

438
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,480
Tell me and it kicks back.

439
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:26,300
Crosses his legs.

440
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,133
Like

441
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,630
cause they think it's going to be,

442
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,690
they think it's going to be like a story.

443
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,710
He came in and I said

444
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,700
Trump is fucking things.

445
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:37,990
Exactly.

446
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,230
No,

447
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,720
and we knew he was their guy.

448
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,050
He was a Douche bag.

449
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,230
I kept saying that it what I don't like
about movies when someone does something

450
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:45,400
absolutely ridiculous.

451
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,680
When a guy like runs a jumps and kicks
two guys at the same time we had,

452
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,360
we talked about this
last time we were here.

453
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:55,690
That's why you a very short action movies.

454
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,080
Yeah.

455
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,040
You make very short,

456
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,030
realistic action movies.

457
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:58,990
That would be my actual movie.

458
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:01,690
Headbutt slammed to the
balls from the ground.

459
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:02,710
STOMP has had

460
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,831
very little time.

461
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:09,210
There's no exchanging blows quick.

462
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,370
Nobody waits like Batman for
that for one fight to end.

463
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,060
They jump on you and kill
you and then there's no one.

464
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,120
My podcast,

465
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:16,954
the champs,

466
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,790
we talked about how we would,

467
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,370
how we have three,

468
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,510
my three guys that I dealt with,

469
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,940
the two guys had to do with how
we would take Blake Griffin,

470
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,780
the three of you together
and my move was going to be,

471
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,160
I'd fight his love handle,

472
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,070
which is really painful and
it was my brother one time.

473
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,450
You think that stopped them?

474
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,500
Uh,

475
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,510
now he said he would just punch me.

476
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,140
Yeah.

477
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,220
Even that wouldn't stop.

478
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,130
You cannot hurt someone so much
for the bite to love handle.

479
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,133
He's going to kill them.

480
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,950
I'm in real trouble.

481
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,191
Yeah.

482
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,330
I would say don't do that.

483
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,260
If you bit me,

484
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:47,910
I would,

485
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,320
I would kill you for sure because I
know you'd be capable of doing something

486
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,520
really naughty like biting me.

487
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,510
I don't have to kill you.

488
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,160
Why wouldn't you just bite ball balls to,

489
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:55,520
why would you go as,

490
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,950
I ain't no bitch man.

491
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,311
But yeah,

492
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,170
you can really fuck someone's
balls up through the pants.

493
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,004
When I think of my,

494
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:00,850
yeah,

495
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,380
but by the time you get down there,

496
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,920
yeah,

497
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,970
I'm not gonna just let you buy my,

498
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:06,400
Paul's going to move out of the way.

499
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,040
It's going to take you a while
to secure a ball biding position.

500
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,821
You've got to find it.

501
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:13,030
Hey is that shaft and I would have
that chat and you bite of shaft.

502
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,090
I've learned a thing or two along the way
and I'm going to implement them and on

503
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:20,100
you while you're trying to find my
cock and balls of my cock and balls.

504
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,040
I would say no.

505
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,780
So that is a thing that people do though.

506
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,670
Sit around thinking like,

507
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,400
wow,

508
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,240
how would I do it?

509
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,470
This guy was going to come after me.

510
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,750
Brian has a very unique move to avoid
rape in prison where he pretends these

511
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,560
kind of blow the guy and then
he just pulls his dick off.

512
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,710
Just take that ball and stick
your finger nails in and run.

513
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,341
That's going to work.

514
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:36,850
Right.

515
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,690
It will work once.

516
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,080
I don't even need to work on.

517
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,890
If you've got a guy with a big meaty cock,

518
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,541
you really thinking,

519
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,700
you pull that cap off
with one yank calendar.

520
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,090
One of those guys who I actually believe
if he believes something enough he

521
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:50,860
could make it so you know what I mean?

522
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:53,170
Like he could believe he's like,

523
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:53,630
uh yeah.

524
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,270
You could pull a car like he,

525
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,080
if any.

526
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,860
If I had to bet that any one person
could pull a cock off of a dude,

527
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,930
a hard an erect cock at that,

528
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,903
it would be calories.

529
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,990
You could do it.

530
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,060
I just believe because
we don't believe it,

531
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,150
if he got a bully,

532
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,700
you don't live in Collin
Wood is so delusional.

533
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,700
Just as a person that
I agree with balloon.

534
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:18,820
I know Brian Count enough to know that
even if he believed that he could pull

535
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:19,391
the cock off,

536
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,670
he could not pull the cock on it.

537
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,470
So I know that you would
believe that he could do it.

538
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:24,304
And I would sit there and go,

539
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,630
I hear Ya.

540
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,590
And I would stand there and go,

541
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:29,350
he's not gonna be able to pull the car
off and he won't be able to pull the car

542
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:29,501
off.

543
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,091
He'll grab it,

544
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:31,780
he'll believe to yank on it.

545
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:32,800
It's hard as fuck man.

546
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:33,760
It's hard to pull it deck off.

547
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,541
Blake Griffin,

548
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,374
dude.

549
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,580
How big is Blake Griffin?

550
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,780
He's huge and his hands are like
20 to 40 to 50 something like that.

551
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,771
He might be able to,

552
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:46,771
it's a little Chinese deck but it
looks like set a big the cockiest size,

553
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,060
you know,

554
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,431
cause it's like,

555
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:51,800
I feel like the bigger it would
be easier could you get torque?

556
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,810
Irrelevant.

557
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,000
So much tendons and
ligaments and stick around.

558
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,330
It's connected in more parts,

559
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,010
more cells are connected.

560
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,551
I mean,

561
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:01,770
I'm sure a soft Dick is probably
easier to rip off in a heart deck.

562
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,743
Right.

563
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,950
Cause you could rip it more.

564
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:06,410
There's more ripping motion where you
could dig your nails and just rip the

565
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,640
whole around your fingers.

566
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,110
It's not elbow skin,

567
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:10,000
it's soft skin.

568
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,690
So I wonder a time talking
on the podcast and then

569
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,570
you probably can do it.

570
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,340
I'm a real strong guy.

571
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,540
Mario has put you announced that you
could probably put your cock off.

572
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,141
You know,

573
00:15:22,141 --> 00:15:23,340
we as the strong man guy,

574
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,440
he's like,

575
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,820
yeah,

576
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,160
it tastes like fun goals.

577
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,970
Like big stone balls.

578
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:30,841
Yeah,

579
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:33,120
that guy could probably
pull your cock off that guy.

580
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,410
Um,

581
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:34,921
but Brian,

582
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:37,530
I don't know if you can pull
someone's Cock off count.

583
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,993
Let's find out

584
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,193
on

585
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,070
one of the funniest
podcast we've ever done.

586
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,770
Everyone I've done that was pretty darn.

587
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,080
I've never laughed that hard.

588
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,190
And I gotta be honest with you.

589
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,250
MVP award goes to private Brian.

590
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,270
He made me laugh so fucking hard today.

591
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,091
I want,

592
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:55,570
I told Brian we should do the lines,

593
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,670
uh,

594
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,503
needs

595
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,720
a pony friends that he's,

596
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,180
and it was even funnier because it was
a contrast to the pony pony and aids set

597
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:10,140
at the same time.

598
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,060
It's almost like someone layer cake.

599
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:12,961
Oh,

600
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:13,531
the chocolate,

601
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:14,364
the cream

602
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,410
watching her.

603
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,970
But people

604
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,570
has a lot to do with it,

605
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,790
so where people enjoy it because right
on the message board right away and

606
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,440
people were saying as one
of the best podcasts ever,

607
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,630
this is the first time ever
that the podcast is reached,

608
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:36,410
number one.

609
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,510
Out of all the podcasts on Itunes,

610
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,280
they're the most downloaded podcast.

611
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,340
It was this week was
Neal Brennan and that,

612
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,190
that's amazing.

613
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,030
Thank you very much.

614
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,620
I'm glad everybody's enjoying it.

615
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,121
And a,

616
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:47,330
I predict this one will be even

617
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,650
funny and a bigger boy

618
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,880
got knocked out by it.

619
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,910
Illegal kick.

620
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,230
Hi,

621
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,340
I'm here with a chart.

622
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,970
This is one of the late podcasts.

623
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,290
We should have drank coffee.

624
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,640
I was falling asleep during this one.

625
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,700
Hey,

626
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,533
lights on.

627
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,400
He had to talk to Ms. Dot.

628
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,300
Zoey shows up in your leg
going through show get.

629
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,480
How can they,

630
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,010
how can people follow you on Twitter
as seem or becoming Steve Murphy comedy

631
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,720
comedy on Twitter all day.

632
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:20,350
All night.

633
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:20,891
All Day.

634
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:21,341
All night.

635
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:21,730
One night.

636
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,860
And what does the name of this movie
that you're working on right now?

637
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,611
They made a movie.

638
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,271
I'm working on right now.

639
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,620
It's called pimps again,

640
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,200
it's about pimps being slaves.

641
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,310
It's a slasher movie,

642
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:35,450
but it's also a commonly,

643
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,441
and when you see,

644
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:37,370
you remember who wrote it?

645
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,703
It's a funny mood.

646
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,090
The citizen Kane of pimp.

647
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:41,600
Slash pimp.

648
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,090
Slash.

649
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,923
Movie.

650
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,130
When we tested it,

651
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,040
some positive for PCP and I was like,

652
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,033
well

653
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,360
that's not my straw,

654
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,620
but I can almost guarantee
you that there's nothing
like that on it is going to

655
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:55,801
have,

656
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:56,101
you know,

657
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:58,440
it's like if I had to guess
what that Charles Port,

658
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,350
it's true packet,

659
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,270
we'd into a joint.

660
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,493
And the dude was like,

661
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,040
oh,

662
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,441
okay.

663
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:03,330
And he was pieces together.

664
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,090
He was fishing me out in front
of a piece of meat on that Straw,

665
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,420
but he could not fucking figure out for
the life of him what a straw was doing

666
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,960
it a container or ground up weed.

667
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:13,610
He's like,

668
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,900
is this fat Moron snorting weed?

669
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,631
He was like,

670
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,640
is he starting week?

671
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,180
So he put me to the test going like,

672
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:21,870
we found a piece of crap.

673
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,200
I was like,

674
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,390
no,

675
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,511
no,

676
00:18:22,511 --> 00:18:23,100
no.

677
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,270
It's for this instead.

678
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:24,931
Although that's,

679
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:25,764
I'm not sure,

680
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,470
but I think that's what it's for.

681
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,600
I was in that pen,

682
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:33,930
I was in the holding cell for
maybe like an hour and a half.

683
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,741
They were really nice.

684
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:35,551
It was Canada.

685
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:36,840
I was like right in here in Montreal.

686
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,750
I was on my way to go
to just for last last.

687
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,160
So they'd probably get just as scary.

688
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:40,860
No,

689
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,311
they did.

690
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,420
The dude who came,

691
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,470
like they pulled the bus,

692
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:43,690
you know,

693
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,420
are going through customs and they
come to the door and it was man,

694
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:50,380
and there were two drivers with me
cause we had to double time to get to

695
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,223
Montreal,

696
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,530
Clovis and Thomas.

697
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,903
And so,

698
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,773
uh,

699
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,200
they open the front door and
as soon as the door opens,

700
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,101
they smelled weed.

701
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:01,390
I didn't have the fucking
blowers on the bus at that point.

702
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,881
And they're just like,

703
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:03,714
whoa,

704
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,060
smells like dope in here.

705
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,841
And I said,

706
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:07,081
well,

707
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:07,980
there was a lot,

708
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,940
but not anymore.

709
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:12,510
I smoked it obviously before we come
here and why bring sand to the beach

710
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,251
literally?

711
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:15,010
And the guy goes,

712
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,843
get off the bus.

713
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,730
I didn't know it'd be a big deal and shit.

714
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,390
So I was in a bathroom,

715
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,810
I didn't think it through,

716
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,850
is it a bathroom?

717
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:24,151
And I,

718
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:27,390
my slippers on cause I had just been
sleeping and they took us inside and they

719
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:28,550
took the bus apart,

720
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,060
went through it,

721
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,670
whatnot.

722
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,040
And there was no weed on the bus froze.

723
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,270
I know somebody that,

724
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,583
well I'll get to that.

725
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,220
They can come into the into,

726
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm sitting in the,

727
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:38,970
in the lobby or station,

728
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:39,240
whatever,

729
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,290
fuck the check point.

730
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,480
And then I hear a door open,

731
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,720
somebody come in and guys like,

732
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:43,980
uh,

733
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,030
could you stand up please sir?

734
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:45,991
And as the dude,

735
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:48,360
the same guy who was like get off the
bus and they're wearing the heavy duty

736
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,250
fast and they've got a
border patrol and shit,

737
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:51,084
I'm fucking around.

738
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,200
Could you just stand up please?

739
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:52,680
And I said,

740
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:52,960
me.

741
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,220
I said,

742
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,341
yeah,

743
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:53,971
cause you signed up.

744
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:54,800
And I stood up.

745
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,050
He goes,

746
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,670
cause he's turned face the window,

747
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,070
Sarah,

748
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,903
at this point I'm like,

749
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,843
I'm like,

750
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,993
am I getting a breast?

751
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,380
And it turned to face the window.

752
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,130
He's like,

753
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,820
put your hand behind your back knowing
I felt the bracelets clamp on and shit.

754
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,961
And now he's like,

755
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:10,360
we're arresting you for suspicion
of a narcotic assumption chef,

756
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:10,891
or what it was.

757
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:11,724
It was like,

758
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,930
he took me over to a holding cell like
that was literally from here to where

759
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,000
that picture is.

760
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,530
And then he goes,

761
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:19,831
okay.

762
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:24,000
And he took my cuffs off to go from
fucking 10 feet and put the cuffs on me,

763
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:26,350
put me into this right
before he put me in this out,

764
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,760
then took her cuffs off and
I sat in that room and shit.

765
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,570
And I was like,

766
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,111
oh my God,

767
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:31,600
this is it.

768
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,700
My life's over.

769
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:33,600
I don't know what's going on.

770
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,590
And they're very polite,

771
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:35,424
very cool.

772
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:35,851
You know,

773
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:37,980
they kept bringing me
water and they were like,

774
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:38,790
we don't want a donut.

775
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,340
And I was like,

776
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,901
I do,

777
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:40,621
but not right now.

778
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:41,071
I don't eat.

779
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:43,730
I was sweating bullets and like the word,

780
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,981
like,

781
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:44,221
God,

782
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:44,840
I was born in road,

783
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,710
the south and what?

784
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:46,960
Um,

785
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,793
and then I,

786
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,140
I still gave me a phone call,

787
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,983
call my word,

788
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:50,830
said,

789
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,663
hold on.

790
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,260
And then he called like as Toronto
fucking border or somebody or something

791
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,760
because we were much of near Montreal.

792
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,450
And the dude got on the phone with them
and then you get on the phone with me,

793
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:05,020
they would take me from myself to the
rooms of a phone call or whatever.

794
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,610
And uh,

795
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,180
he was like,

796
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,480
ah,

797
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:07,751
look,

798
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:09,600
they're not going to
charge your phone call.

799
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,820
I think he gets to go again.

800
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,290
It doesn't happen.

801
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:14,731
I mean that was,

802
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,640
I've never done it before,

803
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,400
but it's the one time,

804
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,320
but I called thank colors during
business hours and my lawyers,

805
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,540
my lawyer threw me to,

806
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:22,930
uh,

807
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,540
Toronto lawyer who is the slack squashed.

808
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,200
Don't worry about,

809
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,531
it's gone.

810
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:27,101
A number one,

811
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:31,240
there's under whatever it was like
this is enough for maybe two joints or

812
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:31,690
something.

813
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,230
So right then and there they'll like come
on a number two cause they didn't look

814
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:35,770
for that.

815
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,660
They're looking for bricks.

816
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,340
Somebody's Willie they're looking for,

817
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,570
yeah,

818
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,680
that would come across her
stuff or something like that.

819
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,960
So they said that's that number two,

820
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:44,794
they said,

821
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,053
um,

822
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,610
we can't like,

823
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:48,730
it's on the bus,

824
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,710
we don't know that it's yours.

825
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,930
So the citation is written to the bus
and my bus cut charged with possession of

826
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,000
whatever under a minor amounts,

827
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:58,331
whatever,

828
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:01,360
whatever is under under announced way
under an ounce or something like that.

829
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,531
And a,

830
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:05,750
they wrote the boss a ticket
when I was copacetic too.

831
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,560
Powerful video.

832
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,731
It was weird though.

833
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:10,780
But the dude like a,

834
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:11,770
they were very nice.

835
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:12,604
Like the,

836
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,110
there were some cats who was

837
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,020
I,

838
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,770
it was leaked.

839
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,750
That was on the bus left on the bus.

840
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:20,584
We were previous chip.

841
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,190
Somebody went and hid
poison or some coat jacket,

842
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,150
uh,

843
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,140
in on a boss,

844
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:28,180
like wipe my wife's Kojak and his jacket.

845
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,800
She hadn't worn in ages and stuff.

846
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,910
And so that's where they miss your boss.

847
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:33,240
But somebody who had left it on there,

848
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,990
somebody else about his stash in there.

849
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,013
Yes,

850
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,091
yes,

851
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:37,600
yes.

852
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,920
But luckily they let me know.

853
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,803
Yeah.

854
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,033
Oh my God,

855
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,963
it's 10 30.

856
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,223
That's ridiculous.

857
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,030
This is the longest
podcast we've ever way.

858
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:45,301
Yeah.

859
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:45,710
Why?

860
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:45,970
I mean,

861
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,250
I can't speak with this.

862
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:48,680
Mother fucker knows how to talk.

863
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,250
It's got some chicken was good.

864
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:50,521
We had,

865
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:51,354
it was wonderful.

866
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,380
It was funny.

867
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,900
A lot of fun.

868
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,360
It's a real conversation.

869
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,991
I can't wait.

870
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:56,550
What I like to do is now go home,

871
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,070
role a big fat joint and go read the
Twitter feed for the last few hours.

872
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:02,040
Cause that that's,

873
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,450
that's the trip where you're just like,

874
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,313
oh they got it.

875
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,100
They're dialed in,

876
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,401
blah blah,

877
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:05,890
blah.

878
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,310
Yeah.

879
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:06,930
Yeah.

880
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,551
It's going to be cool.

881
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:08,384
It's so funny.

882
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,980
I love that we share that philosophy
about keeping everything free too.

883
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,863
I guess

884
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:15,923
I shouldn't call him that.

885
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,790
Maybe easily offended.

886
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,680
Did you see that shit that's
going on with Katt Williams?

887
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,500
Some guy that was a Mexican who
was yelling in the audience and,

888
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:27,540
and Katt Williams told them that you
brought a rusty knife to a gun flight 22

889
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,930
the your aunt Tia gave yet your,

890
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,420
since the era like he fucking went off
on this dude and they wrote an article

891
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:35,130
about it in CNN have the,

892
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:35,371
there,

893
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:37,800
the writer was Mexican
and he was offended.

894
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,250
Meanwhile,

895
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,960
I cherry picked all the information.

896
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,930
The guy yelled at Katt Williams
fuck America and he was like,

897
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:43,560
cat when he's like,

898
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,393
fuck America,

899
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,800
Fuck America.

900
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,220
Did you say that?

901
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,370
And he comes over and he puts a
fucking ego in from God bless America.

902
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,951
It's funny,

903
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,360
he was being a fucking comedian

904
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,250
and writer,

905
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,470
Mexican American writer was offended
and I'm offended that you're so fucking

906
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,161
stupid.

907
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:02,540
I wish I remember your name,

908
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,374
but I don't.

909
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,490
But this nonsense,

910
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:06,050
this PC bullshit.

911
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:09,410
Everybody in looking to fucking
find something it'd be upset with.

912
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,150
That's a live comedy show.

913
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,800
If you don't like that raw dog,

914
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,570
wild balls out type of comedy.

915
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:15,500
The Cat Williams does.

916
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,700
Don't go to the fucking show.

917
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:18,170
You should know that he does that anyway.

918
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,790
There's plenty of videos of him online.

919
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,870
He's a bad motherfucker.

920
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,650
If you don't,

921
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,610
if you don't like that,

922
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:23,600
don't go to that show.

923
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,010
But if you fucking go and you know
what he does and you get offended,

924
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,970
kill yourself,

925
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,291
kill yourself.

926
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,880
You fucking the same fucking boat.

927
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:34,000
Mrs Rogan's or I come out
all this yet on the screen,

928
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,863

930
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,993
wizards.

931
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,250
Oh Ladies and gentlemen,

932
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,893
that's it for this.

933
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,471
That's it for today.

934
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:52,760
John Half Heffron in the fucking house.

935
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,021
If I'm on Twitter,

936
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:54,854
that's two apps.

937
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:00,020
Nephron in an nation and a no
thanks Tim Ferris looking at me.

938
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:00,831
He's like a school boy.

939
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,180
He's kind of attack that time.

940
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,413
He's ready to go.

941
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,240
I always feel weird when I
wear a backpack in the airport.

942
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:07,170
I always feel like a Dork.

943
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,560
There's something about a backpack
like can be sleeping over one shoulder.

944
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,550
He kind of be like kind of casual.

945
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,440
Cool feel.

946
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,423
Just got my books.

947
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,670
But if you actually have it
on like hey for the hostel,

948
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,230
the camera that is,

949
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:26,290
that's a tough looking back at it looks
sort of school boy ish ten first came on

950
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:29,200
the podcast today and uh,

951
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,250
we talked about so much cool shit man.

952
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,170
That was another one where people are
going to have to back up and write names

953
00:25:35,171 --> 00:25:37,170
down and books down and what we'll,

954
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,690
what's he saying that we just covered
so much shit and though the thing that

955
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:44,170
tripped me out the most was you talking
about shoving that stuff up your nose

956
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:48,190
and increasing your short term memory
and earned as Chinese when you were doing

957
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,083
the Chinese character.

958
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,380
That's crazy,

959
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:50,680
man.

960
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,513
That's nuts.

961
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,590
I've never heard of anything
with human and machine.

962
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:54,820
That's it's a wonderful thing.

963
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,990
It really is man.

964
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:56,470
But you,

965
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,470
you really have explored a lot of the
more interesting aspects of that to them.

966
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:01,811
Man.

967
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:04,390
You've got an amazing amount of
information when it comes to that stuff.

968
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,261
So,

969
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:05,440
uh,

970
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,550
pick up that book folks.

971
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:11,551
A four hour body and four hour workweek
or Tim's books and you can check out his

972
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,390
website for our blog,

973
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,620
for our blog,

974
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,550
Amazon,

975
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,510
obviously a couple thousand reviews so
you can read the most amusing one stars.

976
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,350
Those are my favorites.

977
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,873
One Star,

978
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,230
one star review is a,

979
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,500
do not buy this book because he'll take
the money to set a new Guinness record

980
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,334
and strangling kit.

981
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,280
I thought that was a secret
or you've done some crazy,

982
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:33,761
it's like,

983
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:34,870
do you have a tango record?

984
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,590
World Tango Record,

985
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,200
tango spins.

986
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:39,011
And I did a thing.

987
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:44,011
It was sent 34 to 34 37 spins on and
Kelly actually spends a one minute.

988
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:46,370
Yeah.

989
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,430
Oh that was the record.

990
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,110
They do it in one minute with a partner
who travels around you in a diameters

991
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,440
but 10 12 feet.

992
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,230
So it takes more time
than people would take.

993
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,680
How long did you learn how to do that?

994
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,860
Go into this six months in Argentina,

995
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,870
Florida.

996
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,080
Eight hours a day of tango until
my feet were black on the bottom.

997
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,063
How old are you?

998
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,290
34 you've been everywhere too.

999
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,011
That's amazing.

1000
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:08,520
How much,

1001
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,970
how many different countries you've
been to this 35 I had to count them out

1002
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:13,500
because to get a visa for India,

1003
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:16,020
they make you list every country
had been to in the last 10 years,

1004
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:18,030
even though the only thing that I want
to know is are you a terrorist from

1005
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:18,780
Pakistan?

1006
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,580
So they could just ask you,

1007
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,401
have you been to Pakistan?

1008
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:20,611
But no,

1009
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:22,530
they were like lifts out every country
you've been in the last 10 years.

1010
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,440
So I counted up about 35 same.

1011
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,850
How do you have the time to do that?

1012
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:27,720
That's amazing.

1013
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,570
These days.

1014
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,020
I ain't used to bounce
around online to short trips.

1015
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:32,160
I find that tiring now.

1016
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:35,280
I'd just like to relocate for a few
months at a time if I'm going to do it at

1017
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:35,950
all.

1018
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,330
Uh,

1019
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,230
so we'll see.

1020
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:37,980
But I like,

1021
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,850
I do like relocating it cause like the
first time I went abroad at all really it

1022
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:45,690
was a year in Japan as an exchange
student and I was introduced judo.

1023
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:49,710
That was where I lived with a Japanese
family and one I relocate like that for

1024
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,430
me at least,

1025
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,680
it shows me how much my
behavior is just arbitrary.

1026
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:54,150
Like driving on one side of the street,

1027
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,260
uh,

1028
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,710
let's say soaping down in a shower
as opposed to before a bath.

1029
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,740
I mean it's all just culturally reinforced
and so I find it fun to look through

1030
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:07,650
my life again through a fresh lens when
I get back to the u s I think that's,

1031
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,420
that's really fun.

1032
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,651
Yeah.

1033
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:12,330
It's always amazed me how different
cultures are when I've only been to maybe

1034
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:13,800
six or seven different countries,

1035
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:17,190
but like the difference between the way
people behave in Brazil as opposed to

1036
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:19,650
the way they were here to Germany
and I was supposed to wear it.

1037
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:19,820
You know,

1038
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,830
it says amazing man.

1039
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:25,230
It's amazing how people vary and how
adaptable we are to both our environment

1040
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:25,951
culture.

1041
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:27,660
And you just get used to certain things,

1042
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:28,290
you know?

1043
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,650
Well I remember was staying with this
German family and we were watching the

1044
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,720
Simpsons and because
it's dubbed into German,

1045
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:34,140
she's like,

1046
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,780
oh the Simpsons or from the u
s like I thought it was German.

1047
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,080
Oh that's funny.

1048
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:40,530
Cause they had only seen it in
German on German television.

1049
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:40,831
Do they,

1050
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:41,970
how do they translate the jugs?

1051
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:42,804
Do you speak German?

1052
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,940
I speak uh,

1053
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,700
pretty mediocre German
get to judge Schultz.

1054
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,640
Don't translate.

1055
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:48,260
I mean,

1056
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,781
do you know what I mean?

1057
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:49,450
They just don't,

1058
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,640
they're so subtle and they're also like
these weird cultural references to,

1059
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,760
does German efficient,

1060
00:28:54,761 --> 00:28:56,850
do they have any stand up in Germany?

1061
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,280
I've never seen standup in Germany.

1062
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:00,750
I've seen standup in Japan,

1063
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:01,584
which is cool.

1064
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,430
Traditional Japanese standard where
they have two guys like kneeling down or

1065
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:09,000
sitting on pads and there are traditional
Kimonos and it's just two guys

1066
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:09,990
bantering back and forth.

1067
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,700
That standup comedy in Japan.

1068
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,640
It's very cool.

1069
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:14,941
So,

1070
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:16,850
so it's all nice and Kimona.

1071
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,430
Yeah,

1072
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,020
they'll like do like the sort of judo,

1073
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:21,660
Jujitsu style and kneeling on the feet
and then they'll just sit there like a

1074
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:24,210
fan and why each other on the head
and do this banter back and forth.

1075
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,461
Oh,

1076
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:25,830
so they always do it with another person.

1077
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:26,760
Wow.

1078
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,270
They're still in sort of a
VOD village sort of overlap.

1079
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,720
So they do a lot of slapstick,

1080
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,020
ton of slapstick ties.

1081
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,130
It's weird how cultures,

1082
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:33,983
like some cultures are,

1083
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,251
you know,

1084
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:39,150
it's weird how like America
is so stand up comedy heavy,

1085
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,010
know so many standup comics come.

1086
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,550
A lot of them come from England,

1087
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:43,211
a lot of them comfortable.

1088
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:45,340
But you never hear about this
down at talks from Germany.

1089
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,920
You know we had one that used
to come to the comedy store.

1090
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,420
He was like famous in Germany.

1091
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,380
He was like on a television show,

1092
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:51,970
but he wanted to come
to America to make it.

1093
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,980
But everything he did
was like crazy physical.

1094
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,440
It was all like flying through
the air and fall on his head.

1095
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:57,450
It was all weird,

1096
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,360
nutty shit.

1097
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,410
Pulling stuff out of bags,

1098
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,080
smashing it'll together and noises.

1099
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,923
Sound effects.

1100
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,640
It's like their sense of humors,

1101
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,780
alien to our Q and German sense of humor
is very different in the US for sure.

1102
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,110
I mean it's still English,

1103
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,000
English sense of humor almost relies
on a higher level of politeness than we

1104
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:16,834
currently enjoy.

1105
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,520
Their whole this,

1106
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:19,900
the pacing of their humor,

1107
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,531
everything.

1108
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:23,820
Replot relies on being polite.

1109
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,280
Is there any non us place
like kind of about Scotland,

1110
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:28,114
Wales,

1111
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,070
UK or Britain?

1112
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,180
Is there anywhere outside of the u s
produces consistently good Kardex or

1113
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,380
Australia has some good ones.

1114
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:35,830
Australia,

1115
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,440
Australia has some
Australia also rugged cats,

1116
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:41,740
you know they have some wild
dudes so Australia is like,

1117
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:44,140
it's make sense of data when people
are like what the fuck's going on?

1118
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,550
And they write it and it's like,

1119
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,361
it makes sense.

1120
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:46,620
Yeah.

1121
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,830
That they would like Jim Jefferies,

1122
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:48,461
a great comic.

1123
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:49,294
He's from Australia.

1124
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,133
There's another dude,

1125
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,800
I forget his name but real funny
guys from Australia because a few,

1126
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,320
they have like seen down there too.

1127
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,500
We performed a Sydney,

1128
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,390
they've got a real comedy club down there.

1129
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,190
Yes it needs a great city.

1130
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:00,780
Australia,

1131
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,950
he's an unemployed so I
live the apocalypse head.

1132
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,013
It's a good move.

1133
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:04,901
So it's out there.

1134
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:05,734
It's pretty far away.

1135
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,993
How much of a target?

1136
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,900
Yeah.

1137
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,540
Except crocodiles and
fucking snakes and shit.

1138
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,170
Poisonous spiders and the fact that
80% of the country's uninhabitable.

1139
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:14,661
Oh,

1140
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:15,180
that's true.

1141
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,320
Yeah.

1142
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,510
I think you can only live around the
edges and the inside you'll go by people

1143
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,750
who get killed by other animals might
get killed by people you might get killed

1144
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:23,680
by aboriginals.

1145
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,460
I talked about slice gel before our blog,

1146
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,640
[inaudible] dot com
[inaudible] experience.

1147
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,400
And then also Miss Grace,

1148
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,293
if you would,

1149
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,750
if you think you would
ask Mary Kill Red Band,

1150
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,703
Sam Aaa.

1151
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,060
Do you have 50 Mary had he killed?

1152
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,923
Like

1153
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,030
are you serious?

1154
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,731
Okay.

1155
00:31:57,731 --> 00:31:58,140
I know,

1156
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,441
I know.

1157
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:02,700
Sam would love to just
