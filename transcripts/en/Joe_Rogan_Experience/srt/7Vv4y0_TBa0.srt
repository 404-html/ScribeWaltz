1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,830
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for being here.

2
00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:02,370
Appreciate it.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,020
Dot,
dot,

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:08,580
dot,
dot.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,970
The opinions you're about to hear it.
Do you not represent national geographic

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,110
or anybody other than us?
That's it.

7
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:18,190
And even us,
we're not sure of it.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,710
We're not committed to these,
these statements.

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,880
Adam,
welcome.

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,250
Thanks Jack.
Thanks fucker.

11
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:26,050
Right in front of your face there.
Thanks for having me,

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,750
Jeff.
Cliche.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,430
Appreciate it,
man.

14
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,170
Dude,
you live a life of adventure.

15
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:34,171
This is a.
I was so excited when you contacted me 

16
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,800
and I went to your instagram page and 
saw the photos and saw the places you've

17
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,300
been and looked you up,
man.

18
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,910
He live in a crazy life.
I do a bit of traveling,

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,620
that's for sure.
A few frequent flyer miles,

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
man.
I mean so much adventure.

21
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,780
So many different places and so much 
cool shit you've seen.

22
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,120
Like what?
How did you get into this?

23
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,220
I kind of grew up doing it.

24
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,990
Tell you the truth.
I had a family.

25
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:55,480
He made a nature documentaries,
so as a family unit,

26
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,540
that's what we did for a living and so I
was traveling from.

27
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,340
Well,
the moment I could walk basically.

28
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,250
Wow.
That is cool.

29
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:08,251
What is your.
Your dad is like a filmmaker or 

30
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:08,251
something?
Yeah,

31
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:08,900
I your mom.
I should say your mom or your dad?

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,480
I'm so solid family unit sort of thing.
What about,

33
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,400
I guess,
how do you explain that in a nutshell?

34
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,420
He kind of,
the Australian Jacques Cousteau,

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,640
maybe the Australian version of that.
Maybe he started off as a shock content 

36
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,760
back in the sixties,
so it was actually putting shocks and 

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:29,760
putting that.
I'm filming it,

38
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,061
putting it on TV with Leonard Nimoy was 
narrating spock was actually narrating 

39
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,600
them back in.
He'll never be anything but sparked.

40
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,570
I know,
I know.

41
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,910
I love that place.

42
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,210
You get fucked man.
You have a role too.

43
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,610
Good.
Um,

44
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,010
and then he turned conservationist,
you know,

45
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:50,890
after probably bid sixties or something.
So he was a hunter.

46
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,960
So he was going out and killing sharks 
and then he,

47
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,120
what,
what made him sort of shift into 

48
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,961
conservation?
I think it was just a realization of 

49
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:00,961
just,
yeah,

50
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:00,961
what a,
what a waste,

51
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:02,110
you know,
killing shocks.

52
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:04,330
And also,
I think after you spend enough time with

53
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,350
sharks in the water,
you realize they're not dangerous at 

54
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,350
all.
These things.

55
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,690
A magnificent creatures.
They're not under most circumstances.

56
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,340
I mean they're obviously,
they do kill.

57
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,990
They get hungry occasionally.
Yeah.

58
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,350
I mean the problem is really we look 
like seals on a surf board,

59
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:18,560
right?
Then that's a real problem.

60
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,000
It's taking identity a nine times out of
10 mistaken identity.

61
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:27,001
And the only way they can figure out 
what you are is by coming up and taking 

62
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,300
a little bite and surf board and 
wetsuit.

63
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,060
But that one little box can sometimes be
fate a killer.

64
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,660
But it's very rare.
It's very rare to get eaten by a shark.

65
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,460
Yeah.
Fairly rare.

66
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,910
Not Rare enough.
Once again,

67
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,670
I mean,
I should just clarify.

68
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:50,671
I'm not in favor of killing sharks.
I'm not interested in eradicating them 

69
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,880
from the ocean,
but they scare the shit out of me,

70
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,870
man.
I was uh,

71
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,680
in California,
in California now,

72
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,940
but it was like a couple years ago,
some guy,

73
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,050
this is my biggest fear.
Some guy was swimming with a bunch of 

74
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,931
people that were training for a 
triathlon and it was off the coast of 

75
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:07,480
San Diego and he was bitten in half in 
front of everybody.

76
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,760
You know,
I mean it does go down,

77
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,470
but perspective kill a hundred or 100 
million sharks a year.

78
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,610
Well now you and I,
so probably shouldn't we as humanity?

79
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:26,520
Yes.
Humanity kills 100 million in the suit.

80
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,800
We killed.
They killed maybe eight to 10 of us.

81
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,800
I think it's less than that.
I think it's like five.

82
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,070
Yeah,
it depends what you get the statistics 

83
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,021
from accounting because I mean most 
Fatah fatalities and it comes to shock 

84
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:40,021
attacks.
Actually.

85
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:44,941
The Zambezi,
the bullshit because in Africa don't 

86
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:44,941
have great records.
Um,

87
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,720
but I would say yeah,
eight to 10 per year.

88
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,380
The crazy thing about bull sharks is 
they can live in freshwater,

89
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,170
like deep,
deep,

90
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:53,500
deep in freshwater rivers.
They're kind of blind.

91
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,480
They can only see about six inches in 
front of their face.

92
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:58,330
So they like rivers and dirty kind of 
water.

93
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:00,600
I spent two years swimming everyday with
a,

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,720
Oh,
it's about three meters.

95
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,170
Bull shock in captivity as soon as you 
stood up the water,

96
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,380
she would come ride.
And she loved it when it was murky 

97
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,960
because that's when she had the 
advantage over the other animals.

98
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,370
Oh,
interesting.

99
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,090
Well,
you know,

100
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:16,780
the basis for the movie jaws was 
actually a freshwater shark attack.

101
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,770
It was baffling to people.
They had no idea that sharks at the time

102
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,070
would even exist in fresh water,
but it was in New Jersey and these 

103
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,361
people are in a river and I think two 
people were killed inside of a short 

104
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,530
period of time by bull sharks that it's 
swim,

105
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,390
swim,
swim,

106
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,920
swim,
swim,

107
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:36,490
sound,
right,

108
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,230
swim up river and uh,
in fresh water.

109
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,100
So these people were at our freshwater 
beach by the river and they get killed.

110
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,800
Everyone's scared of the great white,
you know,

111
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,830
the big shock.
But if you talk about the amount of a 

112
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,240
tax bill shock is Fafa hm.

113
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,350
That's interesting.
And then you think it's because they're 

114
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,350
young,
they don't see.

115
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,350
Well,
so it's a mistaken identity thing.

116
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,350
Well,
it's,

117
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,530
once again,
they,

118
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,610
they,
they see you using the electrical,

119
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,100
uh,
receptive.

120
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,240
So that I can think of,
see hot beating basically,

121
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,360
but it doesn't know what you are and 
it's got really bad vision.

122
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:12,361
So the only way you can figure out what 
you are and whether your edible is to 

123
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:13,410
come and take a little bite and you 
know,

124
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,400
that little block sometimes can be 
fatal.

125
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,180
Yeah.
I saw something last night.

126
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,320
I think it's got to be bullshit.
I wish I could remember the name of it,

127
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:25,321
but it was a camouflage suit that you 
could wear while hunting that does not 

128
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:30,000
give out the electrical signal.
So it was like a,

129
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,620
it was close.
It was somehow or another.

130
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:37,621
The,
these clothes keep an electrical signal 

131
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:38,350
from like animals from seeing this 
electrical signal.

132
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,420
I,
it sounded like horseshit though.

133
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,100
Well I mean there is some science that 
if you have a faraday cage suit.

134
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:46,320
So what does it live in a Faraday cage?
Totally.

135
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,070
The middle.
Basically woven.

136
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:50,980
That stops a electrical stuff.
Jamie,

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,280
is that real make significant human 
significantly less detectable by 

138
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,360
animals?
No,

139
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,040
it would.
It would sense for sure with

140
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,020
animals that have the electrical impulse
receptors like sharks do.

141
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,260
Huh?
Well,

142
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,110
sharks have that line on their body,
right?

143
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,310
That's what it is.
Well,

144
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,400
a all fish have a line going,
lateral line going down in that detects 

145
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,400
the,
you know,

146
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,410
electrical impulses,
but sharks have on the nose.

147
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,740
Um,
it's a really hard word to pronounce 

148
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:20,740
them.
Look on trying,

149
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,170
but they have this electrical receptor 
on the front of their nose.

150
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,920
And so when a shark sees you,
it can actually see your heart beating.

151
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,840
And so say you're swimming with sharks 
and someone else next to you and you've 

152
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:30,840
been,
um,

153
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,910
you've never been.
You've been swimming with sharks before.

154
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:33,170
You pretty calm.
So your heart's going,

155
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:33,430
blah,
blah,

156
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,780
blah,
blah,

157
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,140
blah,
blah,

158
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,540
blah,
blah.

159
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,790
Person next to you and never been 
swimming with sharks before.

160
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,450
Freaking out their hearts going,
blah,

161
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:38,630
blah,
blah,

162
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:38,870
blah,
blah,

163
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,000
blah.

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,650
A million miles an hour that shark's 
gonna swim up and go lunch person with a

165
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,770
faster happy because they're stressed 
out,

166
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,620
they're going to be easier to catch.
Nature does not like bitches.

167
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,740
That's what it is.
Panic like a bitch.

168
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,450
Nature's like [inaudible].
It's true.

169
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:56,240
If you panic when you're in with sharks,
they'll come right up to you.

170
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,770
They want to check your animals,
right?

171
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,070
You ever seen people that just freak out
around dogs and dogs start barking at 

172
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,070
them and then another person come up 
with that dog.

173
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,980
Hey Buddy,
what's going on?

174
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:04,920
You all right?
You know?

175
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

176
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,010
So your dad was a shark hunter.
And when he was hunting these sharks,

177
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:12,290
was he doing it for food?
Were they eating the sharks?

178
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,460
This was,
I mean,

179
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,590
you gotta remember this is back in the 
day,

180
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,610
you know,
this is kind of,

181
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,250
and c's sixties,
early sixties.

182
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,880
And back then it was,
he was filming people killing,

183
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,870
you know,
20,

184
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,220
30 shocks,
uh,

185
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,790
at a time.

186
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,790
And it was just a,
was the first underwater documentaries 

187
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,830
out there sort of showing that world.
And they were using explosive headset,

188
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,320
like a spear gun with a bullet 300,
three on the end of it.

189
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,390
Oh Wow.
And they were shooting them that way.

190
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,200
But,
uh,

191
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,260
you know,
I look at those videos now and some of 

192
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,630
the species that we're killing it just 
completely harmless and it's just.

193
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,750
And I guess it eventually to get to that
point where they turned around and went,

194
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,230
oh,
hang on,

195
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:53,231
this is bad,
and so use that fame or that desire for 

196
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:56,651
this underwater footage and then,
and then sort of take a conservation 

197
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:56,660
angle to it instead.
So there were,

198
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,080
they initially doing it to eradicate 
dangerous animals.

199
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:05,081
Is that whether we're doing it,
I guess there's that aspect of that to 

200
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:05,540
tell the truth.
I think it was just good tv.

201
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,260
Oh,
okay.

202
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:11,261
So it was just let's go shoot some shit 
and put it on television and here's 

203
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:13,800
sharks.
And everyone's scared of them,

204
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:14,600
you know,
that's,

205
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,510
it was quite a natural thing back then 
to go,

206
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,310
you're scared of something could kill 
it.

207
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,470
And so your dad,
while you were young,

208
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:25,520
became a conservationist and then 
started taking you all around the world.

209
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,380
Yeah.
So we made these kinds of,

210
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,740
one our nature documentaries.
Um,

211
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,600
they were shown in Australia on channel 
seven over here,

212
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,920
Disney channel pick them up.
Um,

213
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,930
this trend around the world and uh,
mainly underwater kind of adventure.

214
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,080
I look back now and I actually think 
it's kind of reality TV to the truth 

215
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,471
because it's a,
it's a documentary of a family going on 

216
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:48,170
an adventure and learning some stuff and
seeing some cool stuff on the way.

217
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,350
Wow.
So this has been your life all along?

218
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,840
Yeah.
Wow,

219
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,070
that's cool man.
And so how'd you get involved with 

220
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,070
nationally?

221
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,830
You're a national geographic expedition 
leader.

222
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,290
I worked for a company called Linblad 
expeditions,

223
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:06,291
National Geographic.
So it's a partnership between Lindblad 

224
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,111
expeditions at National Geographic and 
we've got a fleet of 10 vessels and we 

225
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:12,090
take people to the remotest places on it
basically.

226
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,180
And so they graciously give me a 
$100,000,000

227
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,280
ship and 100 people on it and a kind of 
a,

228
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,000
you start here and you end here two 
weeks later and yeah,

229
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,070
go for an adventure.
Go see what you can file.

230
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,490
Dad Is fucking bad.
It's good fun.

231
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,420
It's,
you know,

232
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:35,421
it's a lot of work.
I don't like anything you get paid for 

233
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:35,421
this work to it,
but um,

234
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
yeah,
the perks are just phenomenal.

235
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,140
The perks are made $100,
million dollar vessel.

236
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,250
Yeah.
Wow,

237
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,810
it's a nice ship.
It's a beautiful ship,

238
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:47,811
national geographic or right.
It's one of the best exhibition ships 

239
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:47,811
floating at this point in time.

240
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,850
And so like when you go on these ships,
like what are the ultimate goals are to 

241
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,051
collect samples to view things,
to take photographs to try to view rare 

242
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:58,410
species,
bit of everything really.

243
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,460
Uh,
so we have scientists on board doing 

244
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,460
some research and stuff like that.
Um,

245
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,980
but we're also taking tourists,
you know,

246
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,260
we're taking people who are paying a 
considerable amount of money.

247
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,110
I can go to those.
I can go on a tour,

248
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,830
official can come down to Antarctica 
with me.

249
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,120
Woo.
It's too cold.

250
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,830
I want to go somewhere.
Cool.

251
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,620
And tactic is just got back from Costa 
Rica where they invite me to that.

252
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:19,140
That's bad ass.
I have to point out,

253
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:20,010
I do it.
My friend down,

254
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:20,760
they've,
Conrad said,

255
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,010
make sure you invite joe down here.
Is that your boat?

256
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,850
Um,
yeah.

257
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,720
National Geographic or Ryan,
you're on a cruise ship.

258
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,950
It's not a cruise ship.

259
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,120
We have to be very specific about this.
It's just say it's not a cruise ship.

260
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:36,290
That's a fucking cruise ship.
There's.

261
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,040
There's a difference between expedition 
and cruising.

262
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,990
Okay,
so a cruise ship goes to,

263
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,910
goes to port,
deport you,

264
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,930
you stop in at some town,
you go after you explore the town for 

265
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:46,930
the day,
you come back,

266
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,610
you jump on the ship,
he goes to the next destination.

267
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,180
We don't go to towns.
We go to places in between.

268
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:53,760
We'd go to remote places.
We've got 13 zodiacs onboard.

269
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,770
So little small vessels to live in like 
a gangster on this thing.

270
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,290
Look at this.
Look,

271
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,080
you got a hot tub.
Come on.

272
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,760
If you were a Russian oligarch,
this is what I would expect.

273
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,070
Look at these.
What are these rock piles?

274
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:10,090
Why do you have rocks?
Um,

275
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,030
yeah.
They got removed about last week.

276
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,270
They got removed because they were like,
why do we have rocks that design 10 

277
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:17,910
years old.
Oh,

278
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:18,780
okay.
I see.

279
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,840
So that's 2006.

280
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,400
It's not like we're talking about the 
twenties.

281
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,290
Back then people didn't know any better.
So you had these,

282
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,380
these rocks are there just for.
Looks like it's going to kill me if I 

283
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,301
talk about the rocks too long.
But when a few weeks ago I saw them 

284
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,610
removing them so they're not been the 
rocks near there.

285
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,160
It seems like a lot of weight to be 
carrying around just to look pretty.

286
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,650
Come on.
They're fiberglass rocks.

287
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh,
they're fake rocks.

288
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,840
You wouldn't put rocks on top of the 
ship.

289
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,850
Get these photos.
You guys partying.

290
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,460
You know,
it's like a Jay z video.

291
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,500
Yeah.
We have cocktail parties all the time.

292
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,460
Boop,
boop.

293
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,470
And Wow.
That is a bad ass boat to be touring 

294
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,921
around with.
I spent new years dancing and partying 

295
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,400
on the ice in Antarctica.
Whoa.

296
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,290
Yeah.
We have some good parties on there.

297
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,650
We do.

298
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,040
Did you see any polar bears,
polar bears in Antarctica?

299
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,420
No,
they're not in Antarctica.

300
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,640
That's penguins.
Penguins.

301
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:14,960
Penguins on the sound winds in the 
north.

302
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,620
Right.
What,

303
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,220
what kind of mammals do they have in 
Antarctica though?

304
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,380
Oh,
lots.

305
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,070
I mean you've got all your different 
well spaces.

306
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:23,140
So blue whales,
fin whales say whales,

307
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,300
humpback whales,
minke whales and orcas.

308
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,160
Um,
and you know,

309
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,060
a lot of different dolphins as well.
And then of course you seals,

310
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:33,130
you pin a pitts.
I'm so elephant seals,

311
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,200
a leopard suit,
leopard seals.

312
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,250
It seals a pretty cool.
Those are the wildest man I remember 

313
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,841
when I saw that in March of the penguins
movie and there's the first time I 

314
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:46,021
really found out about leopard seals or 
had seen them in like a,

315
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,580
you know,
high definition video form.

316
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,170
I think maybe had seen a photograph of 
him before,

317
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:53,710
but I didn't realize like what a 
majestic beasts they are,

318
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,950
but a strange,
almost like a fake animal.

319
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,870
It doesn't even look real.
I think of him like a swimming jewel.

320
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,970
Just this huge big Joel with massive 
team there.

321
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,160
See the size of the teeth on them and 
they,

322
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,100
they eat penguins and occasionally they 
chew on the back of Zodiacs as well.

323
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,960
Zodiacs or those boats?
We have probably about one a year.

324
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,700
They ended up chewing on the back of the
Zodiac.

325
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:18,790
So because they're inflatable boat,
why does they do that?

326
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,480
To fuck with people?
Probably just to fuck with people.

327
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,240
Well,
they're really weird because like,

328
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:29,241
uh,
there was one account that this 

329
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,841
photographer did a,
it was several days where he spent 

330
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:34,501
filming a female leopard seal and she 
kept bringing him penguins to eat.

331
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,460
And He.
Have you heard of this?

332
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,380
No,
it was really fascinating because,

333
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,670
uh,
he was terrified,

334
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:41,200
you know,
this monstrous,

335
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,870
enormous,
predatory and have respect for them.

336
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,220
Oh yeah.
They're huge.

337
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,430
And she kept bringing him like dead 
penguins and like bringing it to my,

338
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:51,190
come on,
eat it,

339
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:53,230
bitch.
And he,

340
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,520
she,
I guess she felt bad for him or she was 

341
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:58,870
just trying to make friends with them or
some sort of strange thing,

342
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:03,730
like she's not in a position where she 
was famished where she didn't have.

343
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,400
She had plenty of food so she wasn't 
looking to eat him,

344
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,680
so she just decided to help him and try 
to feed him.

345
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,090
It was very,
very strange.

346
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,180
I mean,
the golden rule with sort of biology is 

347
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,030
don't put human emotions onto animals,
but the closer you look at animals,

348
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,410
more time you spend with the animals,
you see these emotions,

349
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,660
you see elements of culture.
Also,

350
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,490
some stuff going on.
Um,

351
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,750
yeah.
We don't give him enough respect.

352
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,010
We don't have to give humans now.
Pull.

353
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,510
Pull that up.
This is it right here.

354
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:32,500
How a leopard seal fed me penguins.
It's really crazy.

355
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,860
They have video footage of it too.
I think if you press the video you'll 

356
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:37,860
see this.
Uh,

357
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,770
it's really crazy.
The,

358
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,280
this gigantic thing very well for the 
videos.

359
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,760
Oh,
okay.

360
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,290
No worries.
We don't have to show it,

361
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,200
but um,
folks can find it online.

362
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,720
How a leopard seal.
Is that the name of it?

363
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:52,030
How a leopard seal fed me penguins.
Amazing.

364
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,990
Amazing.
And that's national geographic as well.

365
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,250
That's your,
your folks.

366
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,320
Yeah.
I recognize the over correction.

367
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,620
Um,
I kind of had a similar experience quite

368
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,480
a few years ago.
The Chew Gum.

369
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,270
You ever heard of a Jugo?
I've heard the word,

370
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,190
but what is it during the Iranian 
family?

371
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:10,490
Closest relative is manatee Chigong.
It's kind of,

372
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,340
you know,
what a manatee is.

373
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,110
So think of a manatee and then instead 
of like a beaver tail,

374
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,310
put a dolphin tail on it.
It's very small differences,

375
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:23,780
but basically the same thing.
And there was this one in Vanuatu and it

376
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,960
lost its partner,
um,

377
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,480
and so every day what I do is catch 
turtles and bring it up to the beach and

378
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:31,370
just push them up on the beach for the 
locals to eat.

379
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,430
And so every day he would catch all the 
food the locals would need.

380
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,550
Whoa.
And then they befriended it and it was 

381
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:39,620
one of the juveniles in the world that 
you could actually swim and play with.

382
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,260
We did a documentary on it called the 
elusive mermaid.

383
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:45,730
So I spent a quite a few weeks with this
crazy credit.

384
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,740
So strains like the personality 
diversity in these animals,

385
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:49,580
like glue that.
There it is.

386
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,410
Whoa.
That thing is crazy looking.

387
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,650
Huge.
Chabad 900 kilograms.

388
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:59,710
It's D U,
g o n g for anybody who's interested do 

389
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,181
gone to,
gone to gung what a crazy looking 

390
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:04,181
animal.
They are there.

391
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:08,380
They're sometimes called the sea cow.
They eat about 40 kilograms of seagrass 

392
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,170
a day.
So wireless amount of food.

393
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,950
That's insane.
Sometimes called the elusive mermaid as 

394
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,501
well because at sale is back in the day.
Used to mistake them for four nights.

395
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,830
That's.
Yeah,

396
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,750
well you to be drinking a lot around 
that,

397
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,710
that some people just get so desperado 
after long periods of time alone.

398
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,560
Yeah,
that's a wild wild animal though.

399
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:35,561
It's strange that it would try to feed 
people and they have no idea what the 

400
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:35,561
motivation is.

401
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:35,690
Right.
Um,

402
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,900
once again,
like if you anthropomorphize it just 

403
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,720
wanted interaction and one of their very
close knit social structure.

404
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,090
So when you have a group of them 
together,

405
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,980
they're all together.
They're very tactile,

406
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:49,310
rubbing up against each other.
So if it was in the middle of nowhere,

407
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,420
there's no more geographies around it.
Just decided to befriend the locals and 

408
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,271
kind of go that way.
And there's lots of evidence with lots 

409
00:16:58,271 --> 00:16:58,880
of animals doing that kind of 
friendships going on.

410
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,440
And I've got a good story,
if you,

411
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,510
if you give me a second for the juggle.
I nearly got killed budget go 

412
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,660
accidentally or tried to,
tried to kill me.

413
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:14,610
So I was filming this documentary 
elusive moment and so we've doing lots 

414
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,331
and lots of video and so I went to this 
one in Vanuatu and we're filming him and

415
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:21,980
in the water playing with him and stuff 
like that.

416
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,300
And he really liked females,
didn't lock humans,

417
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,360
humans love.
So he would have some new data issues.

418
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,040
He would chase and harassed miles 
basically.

419
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,160
But back in those days I had long,
long hair.

420
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,450
Sounds like Jamie,
Jamie,

421
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:35,750
there's only.

422
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:44,670
So I had long hair so I kind of fooled,
folded basically that he thought he was,

423
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,360
it was all real casual with me.
And then he would,

424
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:52,361
um,
he would grab your leg basically and he 

425
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:54,270
would on your wetsuit and clean his 
mouth on it and stuff like that.

426
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:59,271
It's very tactile.
Definitely grabbing your tongue in his 

427
00:17:59,271 --> 00:17:59,271
mouth on your leg.
All the bristles in front of his nose.

428
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:01,030
He was just kind of cleaned that on your
wet suit and stuff.

429
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:04,190
He was just very tactile.
And so one time he was doing that and he

430
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,260
kind of went a little bit too far up my 
leg and he felt something.

431
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:08,340
He went,
I saw him,

432
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:11,330
he looked at me and you're not female,
you're male,

433
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,310
and so he attacked me and so what he did
is he,

434
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,290
he grabbed me and then it's 900 kilogram
animal or you got no hope,

435
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,630
so he grabbed me,
holding my arms against my chest,

436
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:21,990
sort of thing.

437
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,020
Took me down to about five meters on the
sandy bottom and just held me against 

438
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,330
the sandy bottom,
trying to kill you.

439
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,510
Well,
I'm kicking and thrashing and I'm 

440
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:32,510
punching.
I'm doing everything I can to get out of

441
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,620
this bear hug from this Chigong and um,
oh,

442
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,960
I was down there for a minute and a 
half,

443
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:40,060
two minutes and I'm excited to get them 
black coming in on the vision.

444
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,530
And I remember clear as day just 
thinking death by Jugo didn't see that 

445
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,810
one coming.
And then as soon as I gave up,

446
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:50,130
you know,
just kind of stopped fighting.

447
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,020
He just let me go.
It was just a game.

448
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,170
It's just a game for him.
He just wanted to prove dominance 

449
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:57,170
basically.

450
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,860
Whoa.
And obviously he doesn't have any data 

451
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,290
as far as how many minutes a person can 
hold

452
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,680
breath for they die as soon as I stopped
fighting and I just gave into,

453
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:09,750
to the fact of death by Juggle,
he let me go and I was wearing a wetsuit

454
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,910
so it's kind of brought me back to the 
surface.

455
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:15,150
But yeah,
that was a near death experience for me.

456
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,800
Wow.
Wow.

457
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,560
Jesus Christ.
How terrifying and weird.

458
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,780
So he felt like you tricked him?
Um,

459
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,690
well yeah,
I told him.

460
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:26,730
I mean he was,
I was there and uh,

461
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,440
there was a honeymoon couple there as 
well.

462
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,500
It was a little resort where we call it 
resort and like shacks in the forest 

463
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,501
kind of thing.
And I remember sitting there at dinner 

464
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:37,680
one time and now the new wife is going,
oh,

465
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:42,681
come on honey,
jumped in the water with the Jew going 

466
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:42,681
to barneys please.
Like no way.

467
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:42,990
I'm not hopping in because he would just
get attacked every time.

468
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,000
So he really didn't like males.

469
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,550
That's so strange.
I wonder what it is about you just long 

470
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:51,550
hair.
Like how could they,

471
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,660
how could they know?
The cultural differences between the way

472
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:54,800
humans were,
their hair.

473
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,520
It's interesting point.
I mean you could speculate and just go,

474
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,810
well,
he's just recognizing,

475
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:04,811
you know,
there's all hippie long hair people and 

476
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:06,941
non long hair people at.
I don't know how the fuck would he know 

477
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:08,480
animals or we need more data.

478
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,770
Do you think that's what it is?
Or the thing is you,

479
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:14,550
with your long experience,
lifelong experience being around animals

480
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,360
that maybe you were more relaxed so he 
was cool with you.

481
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,240
Yeah,
that's definitely an aspect.

482
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,380
Maybe Mandolin and they give off that 
energy of gone.

483
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

484
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,240
I mean that definitely could be.
No,

485
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,290
you back off bitch and then he attacks 
him and the girls like don't hurt me.

486
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,310
And he's like,
I'm good.

487
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,370
We're good.
Maybe just like people to be submissive.

488
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,560
Quite pop that right?
Yeah.

489
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:38,180
This,
you know,

490
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,770
the whole Alpha thing.
It's going on everywhere.

491
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,060
Yeah.
It's a strange,

492
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:47,061
strange looking animal man.
That would be a weird animal to kill 

493
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:47,061
you.
Yeah.

494
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,090
Yeah.
I definitely didn't expect.

495
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,190
I didn't expect to have a near death 
experience with juggle because you can 

496
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,251
barely get near these creatures.
Normally a fleeting glimpse in the in 

497
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,990
the far distances.
All you ever see these animals,

498
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,070
so is it when they're around resorts or 
something like that where they become 

499
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,670
accustomed to humans or around where 
there's large populations.

500
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,120
Think

501
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,610
I have another time juggle this one.
He died or left or something went wrong 

502
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,440
a few years back and I can't recall any 
other time geographies around the world 

503
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,070
except in captivity.
I spent a bit of time with a tube in 

504
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,880
captivity at seaworld on the Gold Coast 
in Australia and yeah,

505
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:27,430
there were a bit messed up actually like
most animals in captivity.

506
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,900
Well,
it's like that lion whisper cat.

507
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:34,930
What's that dude's name?
The handsome fella that's always on 

508
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,561
television.
He's on the Jimmy Kimmel show all the 

509
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:38,561
time and he's always hanging around with
lions.

510
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,770
Yeah,
and he sees the line is like Hulu would 

511
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,030
you do in the lion comes up to him.
He gives him a hug.

512
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:44,500
I'm like,
okay,

513
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,000
how the fuck did you ever work that out?
Hey,

514
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,950
what color?
How do you work out that relationship?

515
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,500
Is that the guy now?
That's one of them.

516
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:55,790
I think just probably more than one of 
these dudes obviously looks very 90,

517
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,900
nine times out of 100.

518
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,670
That's the.
Well apparently this is what,

519
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,540
from what I understand,
like lions and big cats,

520
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,950
tigers and lions,
when you have them as pets and you raise

521
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:12,500
them as pets and you get used to them 
accustomed to them,

522
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,340
there's so not intimidated by you.
As long as they're well fed,

523
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:21,550
you're pretty safe.
They're most likely not gonna fuck you 

524
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,191
up,
but they might fuck up other people who 

525
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:24,640
are around you and panic and don't know 
how to deal and they're like,

526
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,660
why don't you bring this asshole here?
I like hanging out with you and then 

527
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:29,890
they just whack them.
You know?

528
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,970
I don't think we give enough respectful 
animals.

529
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:33,470
I mean just you,
your dog,

530
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,040
your dog.
Like some people and doesn't like other 

531
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,040
people and you should always listened to
your dope.

532
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,300
Yeah,
knows best will.

533
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:42,460
You dog definitely knows when people are
shady.

534
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,140
You know when you have someone over and 
the dog started growling.

535
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,590
Like what the fuck is going on man?
You know,

536
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,840
tap dogs know when people are 
comfortable,

537
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,640
that's for sure.
You know,

538
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:52,600
I,
I knew this lady,

539
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,400
she had these crazy German shepherds 
man,

540
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:59,401
but I've been around dogs my whole life 
and I was cool with them and she was 

541
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:00,040
surprised and she was like,
you know,

542
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,290
normally when these dogs around people 
that ground,

543
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,370
they want to bite them.
I'm like,

544
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:05,650
why don't you fucking do something about
your dogs then?

545
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:11,010
Like everybody,
like your dog thinks everybody's an 

546
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:11,620
asshole.
Like that's probably on you.

547
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,700
That's,
that's bad training or

548
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,720
using positive reinforcement.
If you use that technique you can get up

549
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,530
to do anything.
Any animal and will anyone.

550
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,590
I think she liked having aggressive dogs
and she liked having people intimidated 

551
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:28,260
around her and her dogs,
you know?

552
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,430
But anyway,
that's neither here nor there.

553
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,500
You've been bitten by a box jellyfish?
Yes.

554
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,000
Dude,
I've been stung.

555
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:40,070
Technical bitten their face.
You've been looked at and read.

556
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,400
You've been read the riot act now they 
don't have my mouth.

557
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,850
And you get.
How'd you stung or do you,

558
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,070
did

559
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,570
you not know it was there?
Like what?

560
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:53,250
I didn't know what to say.
Obviously I was about 12 years old in 

561
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,970
Torres Strait,
which is a bunch of islands in between 

562
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,311
Australia and Papa New Guinea and I was 
playing with a holly Patar Strait 

563
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:00,311
islanders,
a local boys.

564
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm playing in the ocean,
you know,

565
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,480
just swimming around.
And then I had one wraparound.

566
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,970
My,
my leg quadricep.

567
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,140
Um,
yeah,

568
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:14,141
a lot of pain.
I've heard a women who've had children 

569
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:19,010
have said that I've said that it's,
it's far superior pain to childbirth 

570
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,830
that superior,
like they enjoy a better or a far worse 

571
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:28,871
basically in orders of magnitude worse 
than childbirth is how they relate the 

572
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:33,521
pain.
You'd probably have to talk to someone 

573
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:35,321
who's been stung by a bullet ant,
which is supposed to be one of the most 

574
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:37,400
painful things.
I wouldn't wonder who's got the.

575
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,400
She's got the know,
like if you get someone to listen.

576
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,270
I know you've been stung by a bullet in.
I'd like to encourage you to try the box

577
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:48,440
jellyfish and tell me it's um,
yeah,

578
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:53,441
it's a lot of pain.
It's a kind of pain where you have to 

579
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:53,441
scream expletives,
you know,

580
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:57,060
you can't just sit there and take it.
You have to be screaming something 

581
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,000
because it's that painful.
It's super deadly to the very old and 

582
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:03,930
the very young.
Um,

583
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,870
it depends.
Done.

584
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,720
Yeah.
That's,

585
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,330
that's actually pretty good.
We're talking very young five,

586
00:25:09,331 --> 00:25:14,331
six.
We're talking about the amount of toxin 

587
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:14,331
to body mass basis.
So if you're,

588
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:18,970
if you're a little tiny kid,
then that's a lot of toxin for a small 

589
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:18,970
body nets.
If you're very old,

590
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,510
then it's heart attacks,
aneurysms,

591
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:21,830
that sort of stuff.
Wow.

592
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,980
Aneurysms fucking well just it messes 
you up.

593
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:29,981
The pain.
It causes heart attacks or just freak 

594
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:29,981
out.

595
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:29,981
Yeah.
Too much pain.

596
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,110
So just the physical sensation of pain 
is the catalyst for these heart attacks 

597
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,240
and all these different things,
but you just,

598
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,430
your body freaks out.
I mean,

599
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,820
you aren't getting stung by a 
neurotoxin.

600
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:40,430
Don't get me wrong.
There's a little in the tentacles of the

601
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:41,870
box jellyfish.
There's new mattresses,

602
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,190
a little tiny poisons,
dots basically,

603
00:25:44,191 --> 00:25:46,400
and when it touches something 
biological,

604
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,760
um,
so that's why you can wear tiny little 

605
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:51,760
thin lycra suit or pantyhose,
whatever,

606
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,711
as long as there's something in between 
your skin and the box jellyfish will 

607
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:58,040
never stink.
But if it touches something biological,

608
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:03,070
then these little poisonous darts,
fire and they fire into your skin and 

609
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,930
they inject a neurotoxin and it makes 
for an incredible amount of pain.

610
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,500
Incredible.
And uh,

611
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,970
the first day back then was vinegar.
We had a bottle of vinegar I remember 

612
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,490
clear as day.

613
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,340
My Dad came over and he got the bottle 
of vinegar,

614
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:21,341
two liter bottle of vinegar and you just
put one little splash on there and then 

615
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:22,190
put the lid back up and I'm sort of 
screaming and I'm like,

616
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,340
what?
Raul bottle on there?

617
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:28,341
But he,
he wanted to save some in case some of 

618
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:28,341
the local got stung as well.
So you could.

619
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:31,900
Oh my God.
It's saving them for some folks he 

620
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,160
doesn't even know I got one splash dad.
Yeah,

621
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I was,
I was screaming some explainers Adam 

622
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,200
over that one.
So how long does the pain last?

623
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,270
Um,
it was about six hours before I just 

624
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,040
passed out.
It was six hours of pain sitting there

625
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,910
screaming,
expletives,

626
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:46,860
and then I,
I guess I just talked myself out,

627
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,000
you know,
and then I passed out.

628
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,880
I'm still painful for probably about six
months.

629
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:54,960
Five months.
Six months.

630
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,360
Yeah.
It lasts for a long time.

631
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:00,270
Not as severe as that first six hours.
But it's still.

632
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,330
Yeah,
it's six months.

633
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,270
I don't recommend it now.
Oh my God.

634
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,870
That's insane.
Is that the worst thing to happen,

635
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,610
like with,
from an animal other than death?

636
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,630
Like as far as like pain that my being,
I've never heard anything that lasts six

637
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:20,631
months.
I'm sure getting mauled by a lion would 

638
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:20,631
probably.
Yeah.

639
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:21,720
But you know,
that would be death,

640
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,110
but you're talking about like damage,
like that's ripping your tissue apart 

641
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,290
and breaking bones and things along 
those lines.

642
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,410
Yeah.
You're,

643
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:33,411
what you're having is just this little 
tiny needles and it affects you for six 

644
00:27:33,411 --> 00:27:35,320
months and that's not the worst 
jellyfish.

645
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,090
Everyone goes,
box,

646
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:37,270
jellyfish,
current next flicker.

647
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:38,010
I,
they were all like,

648
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,030
oh,
that's the worst one.

649
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,640
Will actually,
that's what's the worst one,

650
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,530
Cold Era Kanji.
Um,

651
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,010
it's actually a whole heap of them,
but they lumped them all together into 

652
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,010
this era.
Kanji,

653
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,230
I'm sort of group and they're tiny.
They're the size of your pinky 

654
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:53,230
fingernail.
Absolutely tiny.

655
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,190
Um,
and the pain from them is more severe 

656
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,190
than a box.
Jelly fish.

657
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,190
Oh,
crushed.

658
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,710
Yeah.
And,

659
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,710
and you don't even feel the steam.
Why don't we find them and kill them all

660
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,560
my love.
What's,

661
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,390
what's wrong?
Why is everybody not enough research?

662
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,540
Not enough research on them yet.
We still don't know a lot about them.

663
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,660
Yeah.
The Russians are going to use him for 

664
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:14,660
toxic.
They're gonna.

665
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:14,660
Drop my Manhattan.
A big balloon.

666
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,310
Blame the Russians don't need names.
Some evil people that you don't know.

667
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:20,910
I just love everyone.

668
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,120
Always blames the Russians.
Yeah.

669
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,400
Well,
it's convenient.

670
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,530
You've been accustomed to it in TV and 
movies for the last few decades said,

671
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,880
well,
when we were kids,

672
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,120
the real thing was when I was a kid and 
I was in high school,

673
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:38,121
it was always.
We're worried about the Russians nuking 

674
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:38,121
us more worried about,
you know,

675
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:39,750
we'd heard about the Cuban missile 
crisis,

676
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:44,751
the standoff,
and everybody's always terrified that 

677
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:44,751
one day there was always the stories 
that,

678
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:48,920
you know,
there was one time where we almost went 

679
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,471
to war with Russia.
There was almost a mistake and they 

680
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:51,480
thought missiles were in the air and 
they almost sent missiles,

681
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,310
have their own mutual assured 
destruction.

682
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:54,720
That actually happened quite a few 
times,

683
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,700
you know,
so that was a gigantic fear in America.

684
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,990
But you guys movies,
the bad guy was always rest assure will 

685
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:04,990
be eastern European of some description.

686
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,660
It's ironic really because I mean it 
went away for a little while.

687
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,380
Now it's back.
Not really ironic but interesting that 

688
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,740
now back with with Putin is the most 
potent example of like the scary Russian

689
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:22,680
guy ever.
Kgb Judo,

690
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:27,681
black belt,
completely dominating this country and 

691
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:30,891
some sort of a strange way.
Anytime there's some sort of political 

692
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:34,071
adversary,
they magically wind up getting shot and 

693
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:34,071
public.
Nobody goes to jail for it.

694
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:40,330
There's a lot of corruption all around 
the world and I find it funny that we 

695
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,641
always pick that out.
I guess I'm more aligned with probably 

696
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:43,641
Abby Martin

697
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:44,060
on this one.
I love your interviews with.

698
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:46,540
That'd be mountain by the way.
That.

699
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,130
Yeah,
they do some bad shit,

700
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:50,080
but they also do some good stuff as 
well.

701
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,280
Yeah,
it's.

702
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:56,370
Everyone's got the bad side and good.
So he's openly gangster though in a 

703
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:56,630
weird way.
Like in good.

704
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,030
In good ways and also in bad ways.
He's pretty openly gangster.

705
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,590
Yeah.
Have you ever watched him?

706
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:06,730
He does the sort of public question and 
answer sessions for about two hours once

707
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:07,720
a year or something.
Oh,

708
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:12,721
does he have a watch?
It's really interesting to watch them 

709
00:30:12,721 --> 00:30:13,270
actually.
He's a very smart,

710
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,900
very,
very smart man and even I've even seen 

711
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:18,900
humor in it as well.
Very,

712
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,810
very briefly.
But this humor,

713
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,160
he likes trump.
No.

714
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,820
Really thinks trump would be a good 
president.

715
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
You Shit me?
Nope.

716
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,450
Okay.
Let's.

717
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,480
That's his guy.
Older respect to head from Putin is now 

718
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:33,480
discipline.
I might've made that up.

719
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,150
Check it,
check it,

720
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:39,170
check.
I don't even trust me when I look at 

721
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,170
putting ice,
he wants to build it.

722
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,370
That's what he wants.
He wants stability,

723
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:44,860
stability,
and trump is not cash.

724
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,980
You don't think they're that trump and 
Putin is over.

725
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,770
It's over.
What happened?

726
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,230
I didn't think.
Oh,

727
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,800
but he said he liked him for awhile.
Just came out yesterday.

728
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,890
Oh,
this is yesterday.

729
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:59,710
So I was right for awhile.
There'd been boys until recently.

730
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,190
Oh,
you know what it is because Donald trump

731
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:08,191
put out this ridiculous video about our 
toughest opponents and he showed Putin 

732
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,410
to like doing judo throws and then he 
showed you.

733
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,240
Just see that.
It's a hilarious video.

734
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,380
Play it because it's so stupid and it 
shows Hillary barking like a dog.

735
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,190
It's really like.
I mean you can say it's defamation,

736
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:26,340
like he's doing this judo throw and he 
shows isis and then he throws the 

737
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,360
Democrats have the perfect answer,
but you don't see that.

738
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:30,370
But she's there making bark noises,
bark,

739
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:30,850
bark,
bark,

740
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:31,450
bark,
bark,

741
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,290
bark,
bark,

742
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:32,800
bark,
bark,

743
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,260
bark.
Make America great again.

744
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,810
See it here.
You'll hear the music.

745
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,900
She Isis,
and then the Democrats have the perfect.

746
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:48,940
How rude can you just do that at a keys?
Put fucking bark noises in her.

747
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,540
Did she actually make those noises?
Making it?

748
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,050
Yeah.
Oh,

749
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,340
well,
I guess you can put a little remix of 

750
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,041
it.
I think when you're running for 

751
00:31:59,041 --> 00:31:59,041
president,
everything's fair game.

752
00:31:59,041 --> 00:31:59,800
But I saw a video that I've reaped 
tweeted today.

753
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,870
It's called 13 minutes of Hillary 
Clinton lying that someone posted.

754
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,510
It's all her saying one thing and then 
saying a completely different thing that

755
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:14,440
she's always stood for a completely 
different thing she gets while they just

756
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,230
wanted to make it so

757
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,720
you could absorb it.
Yeah,

758
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:21,930
I'm sure you could get deep as an 
Australian American politics is 

759
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,740
hilarious and also really sad.

760
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,090
That's how we feel.
You guys think you're having an election

761
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:29,140
right now,
the rest of the world.

762
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,110
We're viewing this as

763
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,740
cutest and yeah,
you're not doing so well.

764
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,780
Yeah.
Well,

765
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:41,350
uh,
I think it's an asshole job and I think 

766
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,780
only assholes want that job at this 
point in time.

767
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:43,710
I think at one point in time do we.
Is that the real.

768
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,450
You're right,
you're right.

769
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,650
But it became that with special interest
groups,

770
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,000
with a corporate donations being 
completely unrestricted.

771
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:58,001
Now corporations can kind of act as an 
individual and they have the freedom to 

772
00:32:58,001 --> 00:33:01,841
act is insane.
And so it's become a money grab and 

773
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:06,430
we're a real strange one.
So what interests me is these guys like 

774
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,360
Bernie Sanders and Donald trump for two 
different reasons.

775
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:13,361
Bernie Sanders,
because he's a socialist and he doesn't 

776
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:14,690
want any buns money and he wants to take
down corporations and he wants everybody

777
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:19,691
to pay more money to their workers and 
he wants free healthcare and free 

778
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:20,880
education.
And he's an extreme lefty.

779
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:22,040
You No,
well hang on,

780
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:22,700
I've got to stop here.

781
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,700
I pay the rest of the world.
Bernie sanders would be slightly left.

782
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,950
Hillary Clinton would be probably right.
And Donald trump would be out of the 

783
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:34,880
building on the righthand side.
Yes.

784
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,450
Because when you look at Europe,
Australia is not a great example at the 

785
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:40,450
moment because we kind of following you 
guys.

786
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,471
But when you look at Europe like yet 
nearly all your candidates are right of 

787
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:46,580
Santa,
even though the Democrats or whatever.

788
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Um,
Bernie Sanders I've heard a little bit 

789
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,440
about and some of the stuff I agree 
with,

790
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,170
I must be too.
Yeah,

791
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:58,171
I do as well.
I agree with a lot of social stuff a 

792
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:01,141
lot.
I agree with the minimum wage thing and 

793
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:01,141
that's the one thing that I need a real 
talk to her.

794
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:02,480
Like a real economist who's like a 
centrist,

795
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,660
someone who has a real objective 
perspective on it because a lot of 

796
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,510
people just trying to like protect money
and they don't want.

797
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,890
They definitely don't want to pay more 
to workers and don't want a minimum wage

798
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:14,870
should be 15 bucks an hour,
which we call a living minimum wage.

799
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,290
But what I agree with a lot of his stuff
as far as like people like just just 

800
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,680
social issues,
you know,

801
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:29,681
his issues when it comes to the 
legalization of recreational drugs is 

802
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:34,171
issues when it comes to a lot of things 
like education being far too expensive 

803
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:39,011
and students being saddled down with 
ridiculous amounts of debt before they 

804
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:42,551
get out there.
Why can't we engineer a system where 

805
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:45,140
reasonable healthcare is taken care of 
for people with normal,

806
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:50,141
regular stuff.
There's no reason why you can't go to 

807
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:52,910
the world is telling you it's true,
but I have friends that live in Canada 

808
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,590
and their healthcare is atrocious.
The way they describe it,

809
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,180
this is from me personally from them and
there's more than one person.

810
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,530
They've had issues with needing surgery 
and they have to wait a year and hip the

811
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:08,590
hip replacements and knee surgeries and 
things along those lines where they're 

812
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,820
just limping around for like a year 
waiting to get in Canada,

813
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:13,870
but I can speak of Australia because we 
have obviously very similar system.

814
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:18,170
Australia's fucking fan tastic by.
You don't have to wait out a whole.

815
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,250
Like I go into see a doctor in the 
morning and I can have a cat scan in the

816
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:24,740
afternoon or what have you.
You need to.

817
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,930
If it's a knee reconstruction,
yeah.

818
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:28,460
You get put on the list.
You wait three months.

819
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,610
Three months is not bad because you.
You might wait three months in America.

820
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,260
Yeah,
like it's,

821
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,320
it's not that bad,
but if it's something a little 

822
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,100
definitely more urgent.
You're in surgery that afternoon.

823
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,860
That's great.
And then also that's the public system.

824
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:44,160
We don't have a private system as well,
so I pay $600 a year,

825
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,810
which most Americans find amazing,
but at $600 a year and that means I have

826
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:53,811
a choice where I can go to the public or
the private hospital and so if I get 

827
00:35:53,811 --> 00:35:53,811
told her you've got to wait three 
months,

828
00:35:53,811 --> 00:35:58,731
I can go,
well I'll use the private health 

829
00:35:58,731 --> 00:35:58,731
insurance in Iran on Tuesday.
That's incredible.

830
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,180
Well,
you have a better system than apparently

831
00:36:01,181 --> 00:36:04,360
what's been described to me about Canada
and England as well,

832
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:09,930
but I just.
Australia is just so great as far as 

833
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:10,570
like the cities and the people like 
Melbourne.

834
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,160
I was in Melbourne and I was like,
man,

835
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:14,850
I don't even think I want to leave.
Like I could live there.

836
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,930
Like Melbourne is fantastic,

837
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,280
but have the Australia though.
It's not about the cities.

838
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,560
It's about the outback.
It's about the Great Barrier Reef.

839
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:24,780
It's about the remote places.
That's the.

840
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,140
Yeah,

841
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,250
that's for you.
You're,

842
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,890
you're all about the places where you 
can die.

843
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,000
Get killed by Tasmanian Shit.
Tigers and shit.

844
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,980
Well they're not really.
It's like a dog,

845
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:34,540
right?
Task,

846
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,730
testimonial,
togare Gypsy that moving,

847
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,840
um,
where um,

848
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,150
what's his face?
Willem defoe goes and hunts.

849
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:44,140
The last one finds a Tasmanian Tiger and
hunted.

850
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,500
I missed that one stupid movie.
It's,

851
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,470
it's,
it seemed like a good idea.

852
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:50,120
But then you watch it.
It's really goofy.

853
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:52,310
And then the Tasmanian tiger,
obviously they're extinct.

854
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,730
So it's a,
it's a very like CGI,

855
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,990
Tasmanian Tiger.
Yeah.

856
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,260
Like the remember the lions in a.
I am legend Gooey.

857
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,700
It.
That would be like what?

858
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,100
That's how the Tasmanian Tiger looks 
this?

859
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,820
Yeah,
there it is.

860
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:05,360
The hunter.

861
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
Yeah.
For some reason he was hired.

862
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:13,101
I don't remember the premise defoe.
So I'm kind of interested in yet at the 

863
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:13,101
same time.

864
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:13,820
Yeah.
It's interesting.

865
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,840
I mean,
well the outback is.

866
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:19,841
So the thing about Australia that's 
fascinating to me is how few people 

867
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:20,770
there are,
but yet how enormous the,

868
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,700
the actual country.

869
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,550
It's huge.
It's the size of Europe.

870
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:27,150
It's the size of a continental USA.
It's huge.

871
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,620
And there's only a 20 something million 
people in the entire country when he.

872
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,280
What are we up to?
Twenty four now.

873
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:33,900
Somewhere.
That's Los Angeles.

874
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,240
Yeah.
We've got some big deserts and stuff 

875
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,520
that we've got a lot of big space that's
not really that great.

876
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,560
I'm not habitable.
Yeah.

877
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,910
But uh,
yeah,

878
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:49,911
we got some.
We don't have too many people and we've 

879
00:37:49,911 --> 00:37:53,061
sold immigration not completely,
so we don't have any refugee problem or 

880
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:53,200
anything like that.
Really.

881
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,390
Yeah,
we sold it.

882
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,380
When we solved it solved.
How do you solve it?

883
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,190
Oh,
very,

884
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:02,420
very simple to a trump like wall.
Well,

885
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:04,920
we,
we've got an notion so we use that.

886
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,380
Um,
so when people come across on boats,

887
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,180
uh,
refugee boats,

888
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,520
you know,
jam packed full of people coming across.

889
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:16,521
We meet them with a postcard and then we
turn them around and then if they don't 

890
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:20,760
turn around then we get all the people 
on a coast guard,

891
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:23,280
military boats and then we take them to 
another country,

892
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,800
to a detention camp and then we put them
in there.

893
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,140
Whoa.
If you're a reporter or maybe you with 

894
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,090
Red Cross or something and you go visit 
these dental detention camps,

895
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,780
you can get,
get put in jail for,

896
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,040
Oh God.
Ten years

897
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,280
or something for reporting on anything 
that's going on there.

898
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:44,281
So totally we've solved the problem 
because you can't report on it and yeah,

899
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,680
that seems a little fucked up,
isn't it?

900
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,740
We,
you know how you had George W Bush.

901
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:53,140
We had our own little George W dot Bush 
a few years ago.

902
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,720
His name was Tony Abbott and he,
um,

903
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,630
he was messed up.
He messed up.

904
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,350
This is all his policies.
Yeah.

905
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:02,330
This is all his policy because he came 
into power going,

906
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:03,400
well,
I'm going to stop the boats.

907
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:08,401
And so that's how he did it.
He just shipped him off to Papua New 

908
00:39:08,401 --> 00:39:12,480
Guinea to other countries and then made 
it a punishable by two years in jail to 

909
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,560
report anything about it.
Wow.

910
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,750
It's crazy.
That's insane.

911
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,280
But we solved the problem.
Well,

912
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:23,281
I guess you could say that,
but that sounds like how trump would do 

913
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:23,281
it.
Yeah.

914
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:23,740
It's so,
like you're saying that trump is right,

915
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,750
you know,
way off the charts.

916
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,760
Right.
It sounds like your old president.

917
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Yeah.
It's what I hate about it other than 

918
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,780
it's just terrible for the people 
involved is that we've lost our moral 

919
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,450
standing.
We can't turn around and go,

920
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,510
Oh,
you know,

921
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,430
China,
you'll,

922
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,130
you'll doing this,
that the other four,

923
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,440
you know,
I've lost the word,

924
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:49,441
but you know,
we don't have that authority to have 

925
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:52,330
that high stance anymore because we 
messed up stuff to people as well.

926
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,030
Yeah.
And still going on to this day,

927
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,940
no way.
You will not make Australia home.

928
00:39:57,941 --> 00:39:59,950
What is that?
Is that was that campaign.

929
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,600
Holy Shit Man.
But I bet you let some nice white people

930
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:08,020
and I know my friends that are comedians
that have moved there,

931
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,910
that they love it there.
My friend,

932
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,890
arch barker,
he's gigantic over there.

933
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,160
He became a huge,
huge star in Australia.

934
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,060
Yeah,
he's,

935
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:18,520
I mean I've watched quite a few of his 
shows in Australia.

936
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

937
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,630
Funny Man.
Funny,

938
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,850
very funny.
But I mean,

939
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:25,420
what's interesting is he kind of just,
he's a regular comic here.

940
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,380
Like,
you know,

941
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:28,810
he's like a Tony Hinchcliffe or you 
know,

942
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:32,110
a guy who does well,
he headlines and clubs over there.

943
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,170
He's a superstar,
like when I was over there,

944
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:38,450
like the first time I went to Sydney and
met people and they.

945
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:39,780
What do you do?
I'm a standup comedian.

946
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,330
Do you judge Barker everybody?
Is that a bad accident?

947
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:44,020
That's probably bad.

948
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,770
Next you're going to be throwing shrimp 
on the Barbie or something?

949
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:52,090
No,
I wouldn't go that far man.

950
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm not,
I'm not like that.

951
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,510
Um,
but anyway,

952
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,560
Australia is awesome.
So it seems like a really good place 

953
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,130
though to have a base if you want to 
explore like if you're from that part of

954
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:04,570
the world.
I have a friend,

955
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:09,190
my friend Adam Green tree lives out in 
Australia and he's a bow hunter and he's

956
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:13,150
just constantly taking these incredible.
He's a great photographer as well and he

957
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:16,240
has these incredible photographs on his 
website and I was blog.

958
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,160
He pulls up on those up.
You could see him,

959
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:23,161
but he um,
Adam Green tree and he's just constantly

960
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:28,411
and he's got this Toyota that he had 
specifically set up for expeditions.

961
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,970
I can like live out of it for like 
weeks.

962
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,920
You know,
most Australians have that setup.

963
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,010
Most

964
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,530
Australians have some camping setup for 
a month,

965
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,820
you know,
out of their truck.

966
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,730
I saw a lot of those like snorkels and 
stuff like they were super cool.

967
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,750
Yeah,
I mean you got some stretches in the 

968
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,641
outback there where you can literally go
for 500 kilometers without a fuel 

969
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:49,220
station,
so you've got to take extra fuel.

970
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:50,390
You've got to.
You got to be prepared.

971
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:55,540
Yeah.
They have those jerry cans that they 

972
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,600
strap up to the roof of the car,
these gigantic jugs of gasoline,

973
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,070
and you just illustrate the real.
I put that out enough like everyone goes

974
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:02,000
to.
I'd been to Australia,

975
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:02,960
I've been to Sydney.
I'm like,

976
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,370
no,
you went to a nice city.

977
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,960
The Real Australia is where I'm from.
Cannes,

978
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,990
you know up the North East corner where 
you've got rain forest and you've got a 

979
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,670
great barrier reef and you've got the 
outback and that sort of stuff.

980
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,280
The thing,
there's the oldest evidence of life ever

981
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,580
is on earth in Australia.
There was an ancient ancient reef.

982
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:28,310
There's Adams.
Sam Adams photos is one of them.

983
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,340
We've got some amazing photos that he's 
taken.

984
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,640
Please go to.
He's got a website,

985
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:36,820
a really cool,
um,

986
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,770
but my oldest,
you talk in the human habitation,

987
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,110
no,
not human biological life.

988
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:47,111
There's some sort of a enormous reef 
that they found in Australia that was 

989
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:49,710
just fucking billions of years old.
I mean,

990
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,430
I do these two is where I first started 
with linblad.

991
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:54,950
National Geographic was in the Kimberley
region of Australia,

992
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:57,620
which is the kind of northwest corner,
incredibly remote,

993
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,720
you know,
100 kilometers to the nearest road,

994
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:01,770
wherever you go,
you can only access it via these kind of

995
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,020
ships.
That's one way you can get there.

996
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,500
And you know,
you'll be cruising through 100 meter,

997
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,400
high,
300 foot.

998
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:12,401
So I'm a sandstone canyons and the 
rocks,

999
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:15,110
there are one point 8 billion years old.

1000
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,590
They predate fossils and that's the 
Kenyans that you're cruising through the

1001
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:23,591
whole.
It blows your mind to see that kind of 

1002
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:26,981
stuff.
And then up there as well as the oldest 

1003
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:28,250
human habitation.
And now that's looking at about.

1004
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,500
Well there's still,
the data is still coming in,

1005
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,480
but about 50,000
years old.

1006
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:34,580
So the,
where human habitation on earth,

1007
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,260
uh,
that's definitely in Australia,

1008
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:40,280
in the Kimberley there.
I'm not sure that I'm older than Africa.

1009
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,010
Well,
aboriginal people,

1010
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:46,040
the native people,
they came into Australia once again,

1011
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,060
lots of people very the numbers on this 
but about 60,

1012
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,330
70,000
years ago.

1013
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,310
So that's when they entered into 
Australia.

1014
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,390
Um,
so they've been there for a long time,

1015
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,170
very,
very long time and they're at work.

1016
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:59,000
They're just will blow you away.
Right.

1017
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,510
But obviously people were,
they,

1018
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,170
they existed in Africa earlier than 
that.

1019
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,730
Homo sapiens sapiens.
You're talking about 200,000

1020
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:08,760
years ago.
They,

1021
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,800
that the species,
our species kind of evolved out of 

1022
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Africa probably around Kenya,
somewhere around there.

1023
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,270
And then we started migration.
Um,

1024
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,760
and so we followed the coast,
which makes sense.

1025
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:21,750
Most of our food was in the intertidal 
zone.

1026
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,930
That's where our food was.
So we followed the coast.

1027
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:28,931
And so you go around basically Middle 
East all the way down into Indonesia and

1028
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:31,860
then across the short canoe ride,
probably the first,

1029
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,670
the first ocean crossing into Australia.
And that's about it.

1030
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,160
Yeah.
They think 70,000,

1031
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:39,270
60,000
years ago.

1032
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,860
Wow.
Yeah,

1033
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:45,540
it's a that culture's been there for a 
long time and there's a lot we can learn

1034
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,830
from aboriginal people.
In fact,

1035
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,960
there's a lot of good,
lots of interesting stuff.

1036
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,480
Another horrible human rights violation 
that you guys did.

1037
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,170
Store aboriginal kids.
The empire strikes again,

1038
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,280
started to raise them.
Yeah,

1039
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:03,290
we did some.
We did some saying we you and I didn't 

1040
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:07,191
kill any sharp.
Didn't do it and steal any aboriginal 

1041
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:07,191
babies who can't keep saying we.
Well,

1042
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:07,880
I'm part of humanity,
you know?

1043
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,300
Yes.
A little bit of blind for it.

1044
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,370
Oh,
I don't know about blame,

1045
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:16,371
but we're,
we're a part of the race that has done 

1046
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:16,920
some fucked up shit,
but as also created cell phones.

1047
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,760
Well,
that pool,

1048
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,360
that's all forgiven then.
Real planes.

1049
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:21,660
No,
not forgiven,

1050
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,490
but you know,
it's sort of like your perspective thing

1051
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,810
when you talking about sharks.
Yeah.

1052
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:30,910
You gotta put it into perspective.
How many people have actually stole 

1053
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:30,910
aboriginal babies?
You know,

1054
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:33,360
when you look at the billions of people 
in the entire planet,

1055
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:38,390
very few have actually done that.
Native cultures have had a really hard 

1056
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:43,250
hard truck and they have and if aliens 
landed we'd have a hard time and so 

1057
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,811
that's how it always is.
The most technologically advanced 

1058
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,931
society thinks when it finds some sort 
of a native society that's living in a,

1059
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,430
a way that they used to live a long time
ago.

1060
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:53,780
Like,
Oh,

1061
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,820
you fuckers,
you don't even know what you're doing 

1062
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,681
yet.
Like you got to figure out this whole 

1063
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:00,681
wheel gun thing.
So this whole,

1064
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:05,151
you know,
they were living sustainably and 

1065
00:46:05,151 --> 00:46:05,151
environment for them 70,000
years and not,

1066
00:46:05,151 --> 00:46:09,130
you know,
not doing anything basically wrong or 

1067
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:09,130
harming that environment at any stage.
And then,

1068
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:09,750
you know,
we know better.

1069
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,130
Yeah.
That's how we think,

1070
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:13,170
I guess.
But I mean,

1071
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:18,171
we definitely shouldn't do that,
but I don't want to live on horseback 

1072
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:19,110
and chase buffalo with a stick.

1073
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:21,960
I mean,
you hear this,

1074
00:46:21,961 --> 00:46:26,961
everyone thinks that doing something 
about climate change or environment or 

1075
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:28,700
something is gonna make a reduction in 
your,

1076
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:29,790
your living.
Oh,

1077
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:34,791
that's a totally different argument.
I'm talking about invading into places 

1078
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:34,791
where people are living.
You know,

1079
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,210
this digitas lifestyle.
Like,

1080
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,340
this is an issue,
they have them right now in the Amazon.

1081
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,600
These tribes that are essentially 
completely they,

1082
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,230
they're almost non influenced by Western
civilization,

1083
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,400
but I mean when you come to like 
changing lifestyle and things to make up

1084
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:52,140
for what we're doing to the environment.
Yeah.

1085
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:55,770
No arguments here.
This is obviously some shit going down.

1086
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,360
Oh yeah.
It's a little warm out.

1087
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,610
Lately.
It was a little warm at lately.

1088
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,450
Last month.
What was it?

1089
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:06,360
The northern hemisphere two degrees 
above industrial times Celsius is.

1090
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,500
It's interesting.
You know I'm better than cooling though.

1091
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,780
Cooling is much more terrifying.

1092
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:17,300
Global Cooling is horrifying.
That's when populations dropoff.

1093
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,950
That's when innovation drops off.
That's when it gets really scary.

1094
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:22,470
I would say the warming since going to 
be just as bad.

1095
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,740
Have you ever read any of the work or 
listened to any of the work by Randall 

1096
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,350
Carlson is a fascinating,
fascinating,

1097
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,300
but I can't recall.
It's been on the podcast several times.

1098
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:33,700
Maybe you've heard them.
They're it with Graham Hancock as well,

1099
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:37,900
but he's an expert in impacts and 
asteroid impacts.

1100
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,130
Oh yes.
Okay.

1101
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:41,560
He was doing this stuff out of Utah or 
whatever,

1102
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,860
all the glacial thing and he's basically
taken his entire life studying both 

1103
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:53,740
climate change that,
you know,

1104
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,960
prehistoric climate change,
climate change,

1105
00:47:55,961 --> 00:48:00,961
but within the last ice age until now,
and connecting some of the climate 

1106
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:05,971
change,
some of it with a impacts with 

1107
00:48:05,971 --> 00:48:06,220
asteroidal impacts at the end of the ice
age,

1108
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,180
which is,
you know,

1109
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,990
10 plus down.
Why would it not like,

1110
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,230
well there's evidence,
actual evidence of impacts and,

1111
00:48:13,231 --> 00:48:14,140
and,
and um,

1112
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,990
what they call nuclear,
a nuclear glass,

1113
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,870
I think it's called [inaudible] night 
and it's from a,

1114
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,240
you get it when they do nuclear test 
sites,

1115
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:27,241
they find it and you also get it from a 
meteor impact sites and it's just like 

1116
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:31,530
really cool looking green glass where 
the ground understands.

1117
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,920
Tend to.
Yeah.

1118
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,420
But it's all over Europe and Asia and 
around 12,000

1119
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:42,421
years and they are pointing to that as 
evidence of a massive impacts.

1120
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,890
Like we got hit by everyone.
I mean,

1121
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:46,150
the,
the layman always goes,

1122
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:46,900
oh,
the last unit,

1123
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,030
big impact 65 million years ago,
you know,

1124
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:51,340
the kt boundary with dinosaurs and stuff
like that.

1125
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,940
There has been impacts constant since 
then and uh,

1126
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:00,210
and this,
we just need more evidence basically to 

1127
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:00,210
fill in the gaps,
but there's been a lot of impacts.

1128
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:04,801
We,
it wouldn't surprise me in our lifetime 

1129
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:04,801
that we see an impact.
Yeah,

1130
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:05,310
we will.
Well,

1131
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,010
we certainly have on other planets.
We saw a giant one on Jupiter that was,

1132
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,390
that was crazy.
Oh my God.

1133
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,700
She Maka leave it.
Yeah.

1134
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:16,890
Yes.
Shoemaker Levy was as large as the 

1135
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,920
entire planet earth.
That's how big the impact was.

1136
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,870
Well,
not the rock itself.

1137
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,290
The impact of the implosion was as large
as the planet earth.

1138
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,510
Apparently that's the place to use your 
budget.

1139
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,230
Maybe.
Maybe,

1140
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:29,910
you know.
Yeah.

1141
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,600
Yeah.
It's come a bit of space.

1142
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,500
Defensive.
Yeah.

1143
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:34,510
I hope they can figure that out.
We'll think about it.

1144
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:38,260
We probably the first species on this 
planet to ever get to the point where we

1145
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:42,850
could we have the technology to defend 
the planet from these cataclysmic events

1146
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,580
were the first people to have that 
ability,

1147
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:50,581
but we're not using it well.
We're the first people to come close to 

1148
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:53,050
having that ability.
I think they have some inkling as to how

1149
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:57,310
to do that right now.
Like a coating them with some sort of a,

1150
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,030
a silicone or something like that.
For whites.

1151
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,550
You nudge them and nudge them is easiest
way.

1152
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:08,551
You just go land something on them with 
a rocket on it and then stopped burning 

1153
00:50:08,551 --> 00:50:12,151
that rocket and if you do it early 
enough you will change the trajectory 

1154
00:50:12,151 --> 00:50:15,511
enough to see this so many of them.
That's part of the problem,

1155
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:18,920
right?
There's like $900,000

1156
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,650
year herth objects.
Yeah,

1157
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:25,651
but it's within our power.
We can do it and it's crazy that we're 

1158
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:28,340
not because really that's,
that's something can really mess

1159
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,780
up society that we currently have.

1160
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,920
That's a nice way of putting it.
Mess Up.

1161
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:35,130
Yeah.
Maybe Australia be the spot.

1162
00:50:35,131 --> 00:50:36,170
Well,
you guys have been hit too.

1163
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:38,580
That was one of the things that Randall 
concentrated on.

1164
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:43,581
He showed these slides last time he was 
here maybe the time before that where he

1165
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:49,041
showed these massive tsunami erosion 
marks all over this one area of 

1166
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:53,991
Australia,
which indicate there was something that 

1167
00:50:53,991 --> 00:50:56,631
landed in the ocean off the coast and 
just caused massive,

1168
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,740
massive tidal waves.
I think he was saying,

1169
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,800
if I remember correctly,
somewhere around 6,000

1170
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,020
plus years ago.
Yeah.

1171
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:02,730
But

1172
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,000
those tidal waves from earthquakes,
you know,

1173
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:11,020
you don't even have to have an impact 
against an army coming in and the 

1174
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,930
tsunami,
if you don't remember the one sort of in

1175
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:16,931
Indonesia and stuff like that.
And Sri Lanka liked it can do a lot of 

1176
00:51:16,931 --> 00:51:16,931
damage.
You know,

1177
00:51:16,931 --> 00:51:18,530
I was looking at your notes,
man.

1178
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,730
Did you see a Ufo?
I,

1179
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,230
I think so.
Well it's a flying

1180
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,100
object.
Yes I did.

1181
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,090
Was it little aliens in green men?
I'm not too sure on that one.

1182
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,280
Um,
do you think it might've been need more 

1183
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,280
evidence?
Um,

1184
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,160
where was it?
So I spent a lot of time on boats when I

1185
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:38,020
was growing up,
you know,

1186
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,570
so I would spend months or months added,
see,

1187
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,620
and uh,
so I'd regularly,

1188
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:43,670
you know,
be in the middle of nowhere,

1189
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,370
thousand kilometers from the nearest 
town,

1190
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:49,250
a light source.
And so you'd go out middle of the night,

1191
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:54,251
go to the toilet,
a toilet on a boat is basically go over 

1192
00:51:54,251 --> 00:51:54,251
to the side,
hang,

1193
00:51:54,251 --> 00:51:55,640
hanging over the railing.
And uh,

1194
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,280
and so you look at these stats like and 
there you see this,

1195
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,600
you see satellites,
you see,

1196
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:00,250
you know,
the most,

1197
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:06,340
most people I don't think even have ever
seen the amount of stars you can get 

1198
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,701
when you get to a very remote location 
to the point where you see individual 

1199
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:09,701
satellites going over and stuff like 
that.

1200
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:12,650
And so that's what I grew up doing most 
nights,

1201
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:17,670
you know,
I would be sitting there and looking at 

1202
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,361
this and once or twice I did see some 
stuff that you go hang on and being a 

1203
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:22,700
bit of a bit of an aviation buff,
I love sort of space and aviation go,

1204
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,350
hang on,
that's not quite right.

1205
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:27,530
That doesn't make sense of how that 
object went that way.

1206
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:28,760
And then turned around and went the 
other way.

1207
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,560
How old were you?
Oh,

1208
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,450
we were talking between 10 to 15,
somewhere in there.

1209
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:40,210
My memory between that age is dog shit.
But it was more than one on one 

1210
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:41,510
occasion,
but we're in the middle of nowhere.

1211
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,490
Like we were literally,
if there was ever,

1212
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,210
if you're doing a secret military,
which a plane flight or something,

1213
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:49,400
that would be the place to do it because
we're in the middle of nowhere.

1214
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,930
And what did you say?
What did you do?

1215
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:53,990
I'm seeing some,
some big lights,

1216
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,140
uh,
going to slow a fair distance.

1217
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:58,450
Why?
Nothing over and over I think.

1218
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,170
But you know,
going off into the distance.

1219
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:05,350
And then I remember seeing one time 
where I went out there and started doing

1220
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:08,780
my thing and then I saw a light that 
looked like,

1221
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,470
you know,
Venus,

1222
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,000
you know,
like a bright star.

1223
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:11,630
I'm like,
hmm,

1224
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,720
that's interesting.
Bit light for Venus to be up because 

1225
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720
normally Venus's right at the start,
sunset sunrise.

1226
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,650
So I think it's a bit strange.
And then you know,

1227
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:24,690
and then you look back and it's moved 
and then hang on and then you try and 

1228
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,260
work it out with the boat moving and 
stuff like that.

1229
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:26,100
And then it just started

1230
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,050
to move and then turn around and move 
the other way.

1231
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,780
And it's just like my,
from my knowledge of aviation,

1232
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:31,560
it's like,
eh,

1233
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:33,060
there's nothing really.
They can do that.

1234
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,640
So what it was,
who knows?

1235
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:38,150
But I just,
I find the whole thing fascinating.

1236
00:53:38,151 --> 00:53:39,690
I find it interesting.
Yeah.

1237
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:42,060
I think I.
well first of all,

1238
00:53:42,061 --> 00:53:45,240
I want to believe so bad.
I always have,

1239
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,300
from the time I was a child and I think 
many people share that romantic notion 

1240
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,600
of how amazing it would be if we were 
visited by some intelligent life.

1241
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,950
We're not aliens and it's a big waste of
space.

1242
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,580
Well,
the most likely is something alive out 

1243
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:04,911
there.
The question is whether or not it's 

1244
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:04,911
visiting us.
Yeah,

1245
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:08,720
and if it did visit us,
it would have to be so far removed from 

1246
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:13,440
what we think is possible and as far as 
like technology,

1247
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,670
but we also,
I think part of what's going on with our

1248
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:22,671
own minds when we consider the future,
so we know that technology keeps 

1249
00:54:22,671 --> 00:54:24,060
improving,
we keep innovating,

1250
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:29,061
we keep coming up with new methods for 
all sorts of different things and one 

1251
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:32,811
day we're most likely going to be able 
to regularly journey to other parts of 

1252
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:32,880
the universe.

1253
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,640
Most likely if we raised NASA's budget 
slightly,

1254
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:36,870
well,
nothing new.

1255
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,840
Well I think private sector is probably 
the best option.

1256
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,650
I mean when when people start finding 
profit in visiting,

1257
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,620
I mean if they can figure out how to 
mine for diamonds,

1258
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,960
is there like one of Jupiter's moons or 
something like that?

1259
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:51,530
It's made out of fucking diamonds,
like moments.

1260
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,600
It's actually another planet they found 
out in the like one of the newly 

1261
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,470
discovered planets.
Planets,

1262
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,420
if you find that there's a fucking 
planet made out of diamonds out there,

1263
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:05,450
well we think based on looking at 
wavelengths of light coming from 

1264
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,350
hundreds of light years away.
Not really.

1265
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:08,150
We.
Sorry,

1266
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,120
could you get it here?
It is.

1267
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:12,740
Language.
Yeah.

1268
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,930
English is a astronomers discover a 
planet made of diamonds.

1269
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:20,990
Jesus called riced racing around a tiny 
star and our galactic backyard,

1270
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,520
so if they could figure out how to visit
that they had below a fuck.

1271
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,130
First of all,
diamonds would be worth like a dollar.

1272
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:35,040
Well,
I mean that whole gravity waves thing 

1273
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,040
is,
is a great step forward.

1274
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,320
Then suddenly we are seeing that you can
adjust gravity.

1275
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,630
Gravity is adjustable to a certain 
degree.

1276
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,520
That's probably where the interstellar 
technology will come from.

1277
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,610
More research into that area and the 
fact that we just kind of.

1278
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,940
We.
They just proved that concept that they 

1279
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,450
sort of bastardized in the event 
horizon.

1280
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:59,870
You ever seen that movie where they talk
about folding space time and punching a 

1281
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,130
hole through the two points,
so you would surmount.

1282
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:07,490
You would rather you would traverse 
insurmountable distances and a very 

1283
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:13,251
short period of time.
My understanding is that's wound whole 

1284
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:16,020
log where with the gravity waves it's 
probably star trek does it well 

1285
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,340
enterprise where you basically,
you're just adjusting this,

1286
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,070
the fabric of space time in front and 
behind the ship and so

1287
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,900
you're not moving faster than the speed 
of light.

1288
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:29,730
You're just kind of making a bubble in 
the space time that you then traveling.

1289
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:34,970
Um,
it's fascinating when you read right 

1290
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:34,970
into it and I think that's probably 
where it'll come from.

1291
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:37,330
But yeah,
we need a lot more studying on that one.

1292
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,570
Yeah,
you think you'll get there.

1293
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,110
But we will.
I mean if we,

1294
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:43,210
if humans survive 100,000
years,

1295
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,760
I mean imagine.
And that's the concept.

1296
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:48,640
The concept is if there is some life 
form out there,

1297
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:53,410
we've been alive or this planet rather 
has been around for four point something

1298
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:58,411
billion years.
So if something just had a different 

1299
00:56:58,411 --> 00:57:02,581
combination of elements and maybe 
perhaps lives in a protected area where 

1300
00:57:02,581 --> 00:57:06,181
they don't have a gigantic asteroid 
field just outside of distance between 

1301
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,950
Mars and Jupiter,
you know,

1302
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:13,040
like we do or I mean there's only,
there's comments and they might live in 

1303
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,350
some protected area where they have more
freedom to,

1304
00:57:15,351 --> 00:57:16,840
uh,
to grow and innovate.

1305
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,330
And we're in a goldilocks zone if you 
really look into it.

1306
00:57:19,331 --> 00:57:20,840
Like for us,
we totally,

1307
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,270
Nicole,
it looks on the moon,

1308
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:23,830
right?
But you know,

1309
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:28,940
the dinosaurs is only 65 million years 
ago got completely fucking smashed by a 

1310
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,610
rock like that could happen.
You know,

1311
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:35,611
and you know,
the big crater outside Nevada like 

1312
00:57:35,611 --> 00:57:37,880
these,
there's so many of them that could mean 

1313
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,760
that it is possible though,
that there is a source system out there 

1314
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,931
that doesn't have this issue,
that for whatever reason doesn't have 

1315
00:57:42,931 --> 00:57:47,340
nearly as many asteroids.
And so some life form has been 

1316
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,050
innovating for millions of years more 
than us.

1317
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,660
But that is when we can do that right 
now.

1318
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,840
That's what I'm saying.
We have the technology right now to stop

1319
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,900
these cataclysmic impacts.
I think you're being a little.

1320
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:04,690
I didn't say this.
I think they miss a lot of them,

1321
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:09,990
a good percentage of them because of the
gravity and the way the sun is and the 

1322
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:15,361
sun is so fucking massive,
a million times larger than the earth 

1323
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:15,450
that I think when things are coming 
behind the sun,

1324
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:20,640
oftentimes they don't even see them 
until it's too late and until we could 

1325
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,151
figure that out and you've got these 
fucking Manhattan sized chunks or rock 

1326
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:26,380
for in our way,
I think a one day maybe we'll be able to

1327
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:31,381
do it,
but my point being that it is possible 

1328
00:58:31,381 --> 00:58:32,560
that there's some sort of a civilization
out there that doesn't have to deal with

1329
00:58:32,561 --> 00:58:37,561
impacts that may be maybe they've 
developed in a way that they don't have 

1330
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:38,260
predators the way we do.

1331
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,050
They haven't.
They don't have this need for,

1332
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:46,620
for warfare the way that we do.
Maybe they have some unique method of 

1333
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,690
communication that allows for more 
understanding than just mouth noises.

1334
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,190
Well,
I mean,

1335
00:58:51,191 --> 00:58:52,810
I wouldn't say it's a need,
but it is.

1336
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,520
It is prevalent throughout history,
so it seems to be a part of humans.

1337
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:02,970
It's.
It's arguable that we can move past it 

1338
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:02,970
for sure,
and I certainly hope we can.

1339
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:05,110
Obviously we can.
We can do it in small groups.

1340
00:59:05,111 --> 00:59:06,270
We can do it in cities.
We can do,

1341
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,490
but war has existed as long as humans 
have existed.

1342
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:13,230
So you would say if you were studying 
human beings objectively,

1343
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,770
not idealistically,
not,

1344
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:16,900
not looking at things through rose 
colored glasses,

1345
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:17,830
you would say,
well,

1346
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:20,050
this is what humans do.
It's one of the things they do.

1347
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,950
You know,
if you were studying us as an animal,

1348
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:23,810
if you were some species from another 
planet,

1349
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:24,290
you'd say,
well,

1350
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,990
they do shoot each other a lot as a 
collective group.

1351
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,450
Yes.
Go to the individual level.

1352
00:59:29,451 --> 00:59:30,800
And I think,
yeah,

1353
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,720
I think the opinion is totally 
different.

1354
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:35,330
You go to an individual,
they don't want to kill other people.

1355
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,610
It's in human nature.
We don't want to kill other people.

1356
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,550
Right.
But I mean it just objective.

1357
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:44,830
I mean,
it's sort of like the way you look at 

1358
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:44,830
sharks,
you know,

1359
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:44,830
and you look at sharks,
you say,

1360
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:44,830
well,
you know,

1361
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:45,650
they only kill five of us a year,
so you know,

1362
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:47,120
really they're harmless.
Well,

1363
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:49,310
they are kind of harmless them to one of
them fucking bites you,

1364
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,680
you know.
And that's sort of the same way about 

1365
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:54,680
people.
Yes,

1366
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:54,890
most of the time humans are wonderful.
Most of the Times people are like,

1367
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,990
you and I have a drink,
we clink glasses,

1368
00:59:56,991 --> 01:00:01,991
we enjoy our company,
we have a great chat and that's most of 

1369
01:00:01,991 --> 01:00:03,890
the interactions you're ever going to 
have with people are great most,

1370
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,920
most times,
like the vast majority of interactions 

1371
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,101
you have,
especially in America where there's 

1372
01:00:12,101 --> 01:00:14,381
plenty of food,
there's plenty of space and people are 

1373
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:14,381
well taken care of.

1374
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:15,200
Most of the time everything's gonna be 
great,

1375
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:20,590
but when you tally up the numbers for 7 
billion people and then the battle for 

1376
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:26,171
natural resources and then religious 
ideologies come into play and there's a 

1377
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:28,580
lot of fucking killing going on 
constantly.

1378
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:29,240
You know,
I mean,

1379
01:00:29,241 --> 01:00:30,650
so it's,
it's an unavoidable.

1380
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:35,870
I mean,
you could certainly make the argument 

1381
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:38,471
that we can do better,
but if you just want it to look at us 

1382
01:00:38,471 --> 01:00:38,471
right now,
just know ideology attached.

1383
01:00:38,471 --> 01:00:41,150
Just look at what a human being is.
Human beings killed.

1384
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:46,540
We're killing all over the place.
We're killing each other all over the 

1385
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,761
place.
It's just happening right now as we're 

1386
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:50,231
talking.
There's people shooting people is bombs 

1387
01:00:50,231 --> 01:00:50,690
going off and people killing themselves 
as it's going on.

1388
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:55,990
So it's.
It is a part of human beings that we 

1389
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:57,440
have,
we have come to accept,

1390
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:00,980
but it doesn't necessarily mean that 
other life forms have this,

1391
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:01,670
you know?

1392
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,060
I mean there it is potentially possible 
to wasted resources.

1393
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:08,870
Any evolved alien that we've ever 
encountered.

1394
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:12,680
I would say very unlikely that they 
would do will fit because it's just such

1395
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:14,050
a waste of resources.
It's.

1396
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:15,580
Yeah.
How do you get to interstellar travel?

1397
01:01:15,581 --> 01:01:19,010
If you spending all your money working 
on new ways to kill each other,

1398
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,240
it just,
it doesn't work well.

1399
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:23,780
Also like what's the benefit of it?
Like what is the benefit of it?

1400
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:28,781
The benefit of it is all personal.
It's all like a whatever group gets to 

1401
01:01:28,781 --> 01:01:30,230
dominate the resources,
whatever group gets to,

1402
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,650
you know,
maybe their,

1403
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:35,090
their genetics pass on Gangam style,
whereas the,

1404
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,920
the,
the people that were dominated,

1405
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:41,921
they don't get to it.
It's all very primitive and a lot of 

1406
01:01:41,921 --> 01:01:41,921
ways.
It's very animalistic.

1407
01:01:41,921 --> 01:01:43,730
The biggest Dick Syndrome now in some 
way.

1408
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,250
Yeah,
it's a genetic thing,

1409
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,680
right.
But if we get past that,

1410
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:54,130
like one of the weirder things in Ufo 
folklore is the idea of genetic 

1411
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:59,951
manipulation.
The idea that human beings have been 

1412
01:01:59,951 --> 01:02:00,550
created by which the lady six files 
video.

1413
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,340
No,
I did not.

1414
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:03,320
I haven't seen the new x files.
Is it good?

1415
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,590
Is it on Fox again?
Um,

1416
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,410
I don't even know.
What time is it now?

1417
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,400
I think it's great that they're doing it
again.

1418
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,560
I probably should watch it.
It's like the old one.

1419
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:17,650
The reason I bring it up is because 
that's pretty much what the last two 

1420
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,260
episodes is all about.
What's going on and on about that.

1421
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,520
Well,
that's a big theme

1422
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:25,440
in Ufo Folk Lore and also in Zechariah 
sections work.

1423
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,140
Do you know about that guy?
Once again?

1424
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:29,670
Heard of him to,
I don't think about anything.

1425
01:02:29,671 --> 01:02:34,671
He's just a guy who was a biblical 
scholar and a linguist and he knew a lot

1426
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:40,980
about ancient languages and he had a 
very controversial,

1427
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,680
uh,
he,

1428
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,120
he did.
What he did is he went over the Sumerian

1429
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:53,121
texts,
the cuneiform clay tablets with the 

1430
01:02:53,121 --> 01:02:55,440
weird lines and,
and what he came up with.

1431
01:02:55,530 --> 01:03:00,530
And really,
he's like the only one out of all the 

1432
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:03,381
other Sumerian scholars.
He believes that the Annunaki which are 

1433
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,380
descriptive depicted in these ancient 
Sumerian texts.

1434
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:12,620
He believe it was an ancient.
He believed it was an ancient 

1435
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:15,090
civilization of aliens that came down 
here.

1436
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,550
And their planet is in an elliptical 
orbit.

1437
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:21,810
The travels between Mars and Jupiter.
Yeah,

1438
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:26,840
exactly.
Which they now think is they now think 

1439
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:26,840
there is a planet out there and they 
don't know out.

1440
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,390
Yes.
Yeah.

1441
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:30,110
They don't necessarily think it's a new 
bureau,

1442
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,790
which is what he called it and what they
called it in the text,

1443
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:33,840
but his,
his,

1444
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:36,720
um,
deciphering of the Sumerian Texas,

1445
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:41,750
hugely controversial.
And there's a website actually called 

1446
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:42,620
Sitchin is wrong.
And if you go to in Israel,

1447
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,960
I think it's dot com might be.org,
but if you go to switch and is wrong,

1448
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:50,010
they sort of highlight all the errors 
that they believe he made,

1449
01:03:50,011 --> 01:03:55,011
but it's so convoluted like you have to 
be some sort of a scholar to even 

1450
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:59,541
understand the argument and you have to 
understand cuneiform that weird writing 

1451
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,740
with a little lines and,
but the,

1452
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:03,480
um,
some of the ancient clay tablets,

1453
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:08,481
forget about understanding the language.
The ancient clay tablets are 

1454
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:08,481
fascinating.
I mean they had a,

1455
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:12,450
an exact description of the solar 
system,

1456
01:04:12,451 --> 01:04:17,040
a drawing of all the planets in the 
proper order with the proper sizes.

1457
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,710
And this is 6,000
years ago,

1458
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,550
including Pluto.
Ancient culture is amazing.

1459
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:28,551
And I think it was probably when I first
started listening to you is the 

1460
01:04:28,551 --> 01:04:28,770
interview with Graham Hancock.
It was just such a big fan.

1461
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,930
I've read all his books,
love him to death.

1462
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,570
And uh,
and I remember reading his books,

1463
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,340
you know,
back in the day called whatever it was,

1464
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:37,350
early nineties or something.
And reading.

1465
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:38,040
Yeah,
anxious.

1466
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:43,041
And it just made sense to me that there 
is lots of ancient civilizations going 

1467
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,880
way back and the evidence is everywhere.
You just have to open your eyes a little

1468
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,830
bit to it.
And you know,

1469
01:04:46,831 --> 01:04:51,831
I love that.
Back then in the nineties it was 

1470
01:04:51,831 --> 01:04:51,831
pseudoscience.
Today it's like,

1471
01:04:51,831 --> 01:04:51,831
yeah,
of course,

1472
01:04:51,831 --> 01:04:55,591
of course there's lots of ancient 
civilizations and we just need to find 

1473
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:56,370
more and more.
And I think one of the best ones is,

1474
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,440
did you ever hear about in Egypt?
You know,

1475
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:00,130
because they uncover.
So Lula nature,

1476
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:04,110
there's so much more they see the new 
stuff that I sold that two days ago.

1477
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:04,820
No,
no,

1478
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:07,440
not the lightest.
They believe they found Nefertiti's tomb

1479
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,700
who they found they found two hidden 
tombs in Egypt than they believe they 

1480
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:17,920
might have located where she was buried.
You see that Jamie?

1481
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:18,190
I

1482
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,310
retweeted it like two days,
like maybe yesterday.

1483
01:05:21,311 --> 01:05:23,140
I think what I find it in King Tut's 
tomb,

1484
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:28,380
90 percent chance of hidden chambers.
And I think it's an effort tds resting 

1485
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:28,380
place.

1486
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:33,640
Fucking quarter.
I was getting at is that this 

1487
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,470
researcher,
she took the data from satellites,

1488
01:05:34,471 --> 01:05:35,910
ground penetrating radar.
Oh,

1489
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:36,800
sorry,
yeah.

1490
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:41,870
Do you see that documentary?
Fascinating and they're just shows that 

1491
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:41,870
the whole of Egypt was just covered in 
these terms underground.

1492
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:46,840
They're everywhere and there's so much 
more information and the more research 

1493
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:51,021
we do,
we're going to find out as ancient 

1494
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:51,021
civilizations going way,
way back.

1495
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:51,660
I mean,
I don't know,

1496
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:52,790
Egypt very well,
never been,

1497
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,600
but in Australia,
in the Kimberley,

1498
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:59,870
there's this two types of artwork.
Then there's this one which is from the 

1499
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:02,960
aboriginal people that live there and 
it's been going on for a couple thousand

1500
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:07,970
years.
Then there's this other artwork called 

1501
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,110
the bradshaw or going on going on and we
know it's over 30,000

1502
01:06:10,111 --> 01:06:11,980
years old,
but really it could be a lot,

1503
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:16,981
lot further,
so it's from a group of people who were 

1504
01:06:16,981 --> 01:06:19,011
in Australia before the aboriginal and 
you look at some of these pitches and 

1505
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:24,501
they're amazing,
amazingly intricate and you can't even 

1506
01:06:24,501 --> 01:06:24,501
see the joker anymore.

1507
01:06:24,501 --> 01:06:28,160
There's no paint anymore.
It's just the shadow of where the paint 

1508
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,921
was.
That's what you're actually viewing 

1509
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:30,921
because it's so old,
so they can't actually carbon date it.

1510
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:35,781
They just look at say a wasp nest grows 
on top of it and then the carbon date 

1511
01:06:35,781 --> 01:06:35,781
that.
So they go,

1512
01:06:35,781 --> 01:06:39,411
okay,
well it's older than the wasp nest and 

1513
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:39,750
so we're talking around about 30,000,
probably a bit more,

1514
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:42,140
but some of his artwork is crazy and 
I've.

1515
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:45,510
I've never seen it personally but there 
is one out there drawing which basically

1516
01:06:45,511 --> 01:06:47,390
has pictures of these,
you know,

1517
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:52,670
the people who have to go and go and 
brad short people these long really 

1518
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:56,800
skinny long sort of people.
There's one with a Ufo in it as well and

1519
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:01,820
intricate drawings of all the animals 
that were there and it's fascinating 

1520
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:05,271
stuff and once again one guy did a lot 
of research and he,

1521
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:11,330
a lot of his research still hasn't been 
released of where it all is and what's 

1522
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:14,781
going on.
There is literally everywhere you walk 

1523
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:14,781
up there,
there's this ancient,

1524
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:18,260
ancient our.
It's crazy and it's from a culture that 

1525
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:18,260
is very,
very old.

1526
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,910
Probably 30 to 50,000
in my opinion.

1527
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,820
The data suggest over over 25,000
years ago.

1528
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:28,970
That's so fascinating to me.
Just when you were talking about going 

1529
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:32,031
through those canyons and it's one point
8 billion years old that the amount of 

1530
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:38,270
time this sort of impossible to grasp 
distance in time,

1531
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,360
it's,
it's we in our mind,

1532
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,790
we just can't.
It's just we just can't.

1533
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:50,270
And so that when you think about that,
like this insurmountable amount of time 

1534
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:54,660
and then think about like just 30,000
years ago,

1535
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:58,050
which is still insurmountable.
I mean we think of about $30,000

1536
01:07:58,051 --> 01:08:00,720
in comparison to one point 8 billion not
that long ago,

1537
01:08:00,721 --> 01:08:01,860
but it's impossible.
You,

1538
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,520
your mind is not going to get it.
It's a number.

1539
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:08,820
It's like I have $30,000
like that.

1540
01:08:08,821 --> 01:08:10,920
You understand?
You make $30,000,

1541
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:13,590
you understand $30,000,
you don't understand 30,000

1542
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:15,950
years.
It just not to get in there.

1543
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,930
At least my,
my comprehension for you,

1544
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:24,030
you just can't even comprehend it.
But the Graham Hancock stuff combined 

1545
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:28,181
with the Randall Carlson stuff is to me 
where it all sort of comes together 

1546
01:08:28,181 --> 01:08:29,570
because Randall Carlson offers an 
explanation for these.

1547
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:34,610
These civilizations being so advanced 
but yet all essentially wiped out,

1548
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
just rising sea levels can explain that 
so many people don't know that the sea 

1549
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:43,580
level was about 150 meters lower than it
is today.

1550
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:45,890
Um,
and so all these civilizations,

1551
01:08:45,891 --> 01:08:48,320
civilizations are always put on the 
coast,

1552
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,880
so you're right on the coast.
Massive amount of people and suddenly a 

1553
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,201
hundred and 50 meters of waters there.
There is so much that we still discover 

1554
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,720
on our coast in 150 meters of water.
There will be lots and lots of evidence 

1555
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,501
down there,
but it gets covered in silt within a 

1556
01:09:05,501 --> 01:09:06,020
thousand years and it's hard to find 
someday they're going to find Miami.

1557
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,020
They're going to find my.
They go,

1558
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:10,330
what the hell happened here?
Jesus Christ,

1559
01:09:10,331 --> 01:09:15,331
just bags of coke and fake tits.
They're just going to find like 

1560
01:09:15,331 --> 01:09:19,210
stilettos Ferrari's under water.
I liked that as a thought experiment of 

1561
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:23,090
go forward 10,000
years and be a geologist looking back at

1562
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,330
our little timeframe here,
the anthropocene or whatever you want to

1563
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:31,331
call them,
where humans have been impacting the 

1564
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:31,360
planet like that layer of rock.
What are you going to find in it?

1565
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,200
I found that interesting.
What do you think is going to be there?

1566
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,120
They're going to find those kettlebells 
behind you.

1567
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:40,240
The Werewolf one.
You're going to fuck with these people 

1568
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:40,240
doing.
They're going to find,

1569
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,450
well,
you're going to find only stone.

1570
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,260
Really,
essentially.

1571
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,220
I mean,
have you ever seen that?

1572
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,390
Um,
uh,

1573
01:09:44,391 --> 01:09:49,391
there was a documentary that they did 
where they showed what would happen 

1574
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:50,870
within a thousand years if we just 
abandoned cities.

1575
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:55,930
Like what would happen?
How could you have to take into 

1576
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:55,930
documentary series?
That was it.

1577
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:55,930
Yeah.
Amazing,

1578
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:55,930
right?
Yeah.

1579
01:09:55,930 --> 01:10:00,700
Well there's some photos of Detroit.
It's really interesting how nature is 

1580
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:05,051
taking over buildings in Detroit.
Like trees are growing through the 

1581
01:10:05,051 --> 01:10:07,460
center of houses and it's just only 
within a few decades,

1582
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:12,910
the main source of erosion in the 
kimberleys and stuff like that is 

1583
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:12,910
plants.
And so in the,

1584
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:15,530
in the dry season,
they grow into the cracks and stuff.

1585
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:16,970
That routes.
And then in the wet season,

1586
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,410
they resemble this water and their route
swell and exerts a pressure about,

1587
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:24,020
I think that 3000 psi,
it just literally just cracks it.

1588
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:27,050
And that happens to concrete if you're 
not constantly pulling that,

1589
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:29,990
all those grass seeds and making sure 
stuff isn't growing around concrete,

1590
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:35,260
all our infrastructure will be crumbled 
and very little left just by plants are 

1591
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,000
amazing.
Yeah.

1592
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,640
I pulled the wire and pull it.

1593
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:41,810
I had a problem my toilet and put this 
on Instagram,

1594
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,640
find that,
that toilet monster.

1595
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:44,610
So,
uh,

1596
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:49,070
I had the guy come over the plumber guy 
and just doesn't flush.

1597
01:10:49,071 --> 01:10:53,930
I don't know what's going on.
So he was like a snake that has a camera

1598
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:58,160
on it and they find that there was a 
crack in the pipe and the roots had gone

1599
01:10:58,161 --> 01:11:03,161
through the small crack in the pipe,
gotten inside the toilet pipe and filled

1600
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:08,690
the entire pipe with a root system.
I mean it looked like an animal.

1601
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:12,110
I mean we're talking about something 
that was like four plus feet long.

1602
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,250
Enormous look it,
leave that up there.

1603
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:19,410
They pulled that out of my toilet.
And then it's saying,

1604
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,300
yeah,
but does it surprise me?

1605
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:24,270
Doesn't surprise me there now,
but back then I was like,

1606
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:26,970
what the fuck?
They will be.

1607
01:11:26,971 --> 01:11:28,850
I mean that life after people,
you watch that thing,

1608
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:32,880
they get to 100 years and you barely 
recognize the city 100 years later.

1609
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:33,870
Yeah,
there's some plans.

1610
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,970
There's some cool photos of in Detroit.
Look at that photo of this.

1611
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,230
These houses that are just being taken 
over by trees.

1612
01:11:40,231 --> 01:11:44,460
That's the center of a house.
It just trees grow in the middle of it.

1613
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:47,850
They burst through the foundation,
they break through the bottom floors.

1614
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:49,710
They go through the ceiling,
they fill up.

1615
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,700
Look at that house.
Yeah.

1616
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:56,210
Well this is something that we were 
talking about before we started the 

1617
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:59,151
show.
You were talking about being in Costa 

1618
01:11:59,151 --> 01:11:59,860
Rica and these people see what you would
call like Phantom Pyramids.

1619
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:01,880
They think people always want to.
They.

1620
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:05,460
It's very beneficial to find ancient 
structure.

1621
01:12:05,461 --> 01:12:10,461
So there's a.
there's a few ancient structures 

1622
01:12:10,461 --> 01:12:12,741
throughout the world that are extremely 
controversial because people look at 

1623
01:12:12,741 --> 01:12:12,741
them and they go,
well then another say yard.

1624
01:12:12,741 --> 01:12:13,140
Dang.
That's like A.

1625
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:18,440
Essentially it's a structure that is 
just a natural structure that you're 

1626
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,530
trying to attribute to a civilization.

1627
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:25,310
Well,
there's enough ancient structures out 

1628
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:25,310
there to be amazed.
Let's just put that forth.

1629
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:26,190
Like you don't need to find hundreds of 
them.

1630
01:12:26,191 --> 01:12:28,890
The the,
the 20 or 30 that we have is amazing.

1631
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,600
Right.
But we like finding them in our yard.

1632
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:35,990
Yeah.
I was a cheer Polo if you ever heard of 

1633
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:35,990
that.
That's where I went.

1634
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:40,581
And Costa Rica.
I was visiting my cousin down there and 

1635
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:42,910
a vibe.
I just got to put that out there.

1636
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,680
Like when you're up in the mountains 
there.

1637
01:12:44,681 --> 01:12:49,681
I had a little Sabina on the top of a 
ridge looking over this massive valley 

1638
01:12:49,681 --> 01:12:53,750
and the vibe and the like.
It's just phenomenal because the 

1639
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,991
indigenous people there are still 
relatively in touch with the natural 

1640
01:12:56,991 --> 01:12:59,280
environment and there's large areas here
with me as a gringo.

1641
01:12:59,281 --> 01:13:01,350
I can't go.
I can't go anywhere near it.

1642
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:06,410
I'm only the.
The indigenous people there and people 

1643
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:06,960
look at satellite maps and they go,
yeah,

1644
01:13:06,961 --> 01:13:09,030
this is one massive pyramid.

1645
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:13,540
The largest pyramid in the world could 
also just be a mountain as well.

1646
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:15,880
Like I'm all about evidence.
Show me the evidence and um,

1647
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:17,710
I've got an open mind.
I'm happy I do.

1648
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:20,400
They think it's the largest pyramid 
normal just by.

1649
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:22,250
If you look at the satellite data and 
then draw it out,

1650
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,730
it would be the largest pyramid in the 
world.

1651
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,760
Right?
But what makes them think that it's a 

1652
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,070
pyramid shape and stuff like that?
Yeah,

1653
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,230
I,
that's it right there.

1654
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:36,860
That's a fucking mountain bitch you get 
out of here.

1655
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:40,650
So that's ridiculous.
Well,

1656
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:45,651
there's actually a dance where I live,
there's a place called Walters pyramid 

1657
01:13:45,651 --> 01:13:47,940
and there is actually this Little Hill 
Mountain,

1658
01:13:47,941 --> 01:13:50,280
whatever you want that's in the shape of
a pyramid perfectly.

1659
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,610
And this,
it's in Cannes called Walsh's pyramid.

1660
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:58,770
People run up and down it all the time.
There's a big fitness thing for it's,

1661
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,690
you know,
and that's pretty much a pyramid,

1662
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:03,150
but it's just a,
it's just a natural formation.

1663
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,900
So it's not a pyramid,
but that mountain is a mountain.

1664
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:10,170
It's like saying the earth is the 
biggest soccer ball in the world.

1665
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,860
I mean,
it kind of is.

1666
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,720
If we were big enough to kick it.

1667
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,800
Yeah,
exactly.

1668
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:15,690
You know,
but it's,

1669
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:18,240
it's the earth.
We found a huge ball.

1670
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:21,430
It's 24,000
miles in a circle and you're standing on

1671
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:21,520
it.

1672
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,560
As I said before,
the show to Costa Rica.

1673
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:26,360
This is so crazy.
People down there.

1674
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,430
Look,
I've got an open mind.

1675
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:28,970
I'm willing to listen to people,
but uh,

1676
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,440
yeah,
show me the evidence.

1677
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:33,050
There's a way that you can get

1678
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:38,380
when you party too much,
where your grasp on reality is like 

1679
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:42,431
holding onto a dolphin with olive oil on
your hands and you just,

1680
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:48,350
you just can't quite grasp it.
And I've met a lot of people like that.

1681
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:53,380
All,
lot of people like that because of my 

1682
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,290
reputation within a,
you know,

1683
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:59,410
quote unquote psychedelic community and 
my connections to marijuana on 

1684
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:03,851
psychedelic drugs and all that stuff.
I've met so many I've met before I go 

1685
01:15:03,951 --> 01:15:05,690
negative,
amazing people.

1686
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:10,720
I've met some really fascinating 
openminded people that have Dennis 

1687
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,620
Mckenna,
the Lorenzo haggerty.

1688
01:15:12,621 --> 01:15:15,860
I met some amazing people,
but I've also met some,

1689
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:21,340
like some people that they've lost their
ability to discern what might be 

1690
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:27,520
possible versus what you're adding to 
all this stuff to make it more fantastic

1691
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:29,960
than it really is.
And,

1692
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,300
and by doing so,
you're,

1693
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:36,490
you've entered into this sort of fantasy
land and you've sort of negated all 

1694
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,990
potential realistic,
uh,

1695
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,990
interpretations of.

1696
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,430
Yeah.
When I meet people at that,

1697
01:15:40,431 --> 01:15:43,910
and I do too,
I always push them towards them saying,

1698
01:15:43,911 --> 01:15:45,320
okay,
so you've read these books now,

1699
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:49,820
now going to read a physics textbook and
just get all your information.

1700
01:15:49,821 --> 01:15:51,190
Then make your own opinions,
your opinion.

1701
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:56,230
Well,
you're dealing with more high level 

1702
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:56,230
people.
You're dealing with book readers.

1703
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,950
I'm dealing with youtube watchers,
man.

1704
01:15:57,951 --> 01:16:01,940
I am really lucky to new into a youtube 
video about reptilians.

1705
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,460
Don't be so quick to dismiss them,
brother.

1706
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:05,140
There are amongst.

1707
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:10,350
So I'm very lucky that in my job and I 
guess the brand national geographic as 

1708
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:14,051
well,
it brings in people who are progressive 

1709
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:14,780
nature lovers,
chimney rather intelligent.

1710
01:16:14,781 --> 01:16:17,300
I have dinner with these people and 
that's probably the biggest perks for me

1711
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:22,480
is you meet people who are just 
fascinating because they always attack 

1712
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,771
you with questions,
so you spend half the meal just 

1713
01:16:26,771 --> 01:16:26,771
answering questions like we're doing now
kind of thing,

1714
01:16:26,771 --> 01:16:28,880
and then then eventually turn around and
go,

1715
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:29,660
well,
what do you do?

1716
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,620
And generally the graduates of Harvard 
or mit and it's like,

1717
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:34,310
what do you do?
Well,

1718
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:39,730
on the International Space Station,
the little box that spins the solar 

1719
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:39,730
panels,
I invented that,

1720
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:41,100
you know,
even some.

1721
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,250
I met a,
I think it was the older George Bush,

1722
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,490
George H,
w Bush,

1723
01:16:45,491 --> 01:16:48,140
his lawyer had some very pertinent 
questions for him.

1724
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:53,830
You just meet some really interesting 
people that are kind of unknown I 

1725
01:16:54,411 --> 01:16:59,411
suppose to a certain degree and just 
hearing their opinions and their life 

1726
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:00,110
story.
It's fascinating.

1727
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:01,520
People are fascinating.

1728
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:04,550
Well,
it seems like being involved in national

1729
01:17:04,551 --> 01:17:09,470
geographic would make kind of like a 
magnet for curiosity in the creek.

1730
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:10,190
Curious people

1731
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,300
just come to you and go,
Ooh,

1732
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,280
that's as soon as you messaged me,
I was like,

1733
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:16,670
Ooh,
this fucking guy's seen some shit.

1734
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,980
Yep.
Yeah.

1735
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:23,981
There's a lot of,
I've worked on other ships that don't 

1736
01:17:23,981 --> 01:17:26,621
have the national geographic brand and 
yet you still get 50 percent really 

1737
01:17:26,621 --> 01:17:26,630
cool,
interesting people,

1738
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:31,631
but then you get a group of people who 
also aren't that interested in what's 

1739
01:17:31,631 --> 01:17:35,021
going on and that's kind of a selling 
point is that we have all these experts 

1740
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:35,021
on there.
I mean,

1741
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:37,070
I wouldn't go so far.
It's called myself an expert,

1742
01:17:37,071 --> 01:17:42,071
but like we went to Easter island a 
couple months ago and we had the world 

1743
01:17:42,071 --> 01:17:43,520
expert on Easter island on board the 
ship.

1744
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:48,730
That was,
that was the guy that was living next 

1745
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:48,730
door to me.
That's the guy from your instagram page.

1746
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:48,730
A.
Yeah.

1747
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:49,400
Yeah.
Year.

1748
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:51,290
Yes.
Last name.

1749
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:53,870
How do you pronounce it?
Jamie?

1750
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,420
Christiana crop on instagram.
Um,

1751
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,450
his,
uh,

1752
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,520
the photos of Easter island to me.
I am absolutely blown away by Easter 

1753
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,860
Island and perplexed and fascinated and,
and I always try to understand.

1754
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:13,861
I'm like,
why would someone spend so much time to 

1755
01:18:13,861 --> 01:18:14,650
make these statues and where are they 
getting these stones from and like.

1756
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:15,920
And they go deep,
deep,

1757
01:18:15,921 --> 01:18:18,830
deep into the ground.
Like when you go deeper into the ground,

1758
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:23,831
you see that it's not just a head and 
there's a whole body and a full figure 

1759
01:18:23,831 --> 01:18:23,831
down there.

1760
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:30,260
What do you mean or is that fake?
That's all those pictures where they dug

1761
01:18:30,261 --> 01:18:32,000
into the ground.
You see like this,

1762
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,190
this shoulders and stuff like that.
They're not.

1763
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:40,480
Well,
I suppose you could say that some of 

1764
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:40,480
them do have bodies.
Yes,

1765
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,941
but most of the ones you see the most of
them are like that just to show most of 

1766
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:44,030
them,
but that's what you see.

1767
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:49,240
But under the ground isn't there more?
I mean this is obviously a victim of 

1768
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:49,240
erosion,
right?

1769
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,380
These things have been eroded by time 
and wind and sand.

1770
01:18:52,381 --> 01:18:54,650
These ones actually they couldn't be 
bothered moving them.

1771
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:55,670
These are right.
The quarry,

1772
01:18:55,671 --> 01:18:57,770
this is where they've cut them out of 
the side of the mountain.

1773
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:02,290
This group right here and so and then 
they haven't been bothered or whatever's

1774
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:03,530
happened.
Haven't been bothered to move.

1775
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:08,540
The cute doug who's doggy,
just random dog came up and set my 

1776
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:08,540
photos everywhere.

1777
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,950
Really?
It was like a wild dog.

1778
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:10,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

1779
01:19:10,851 --> 01:19:15,851
Just there's so many dogs on that island
and they're all so friendly and lovely 

1780
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,840
and I will as soon as I see that.
I know that's a good community.

1781
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,080
One of the things for me straightaway 
dog.

1782
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,480
Yeah,
so I'm Jamie,

1783
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:26,990
see if he could find those photos of 
Easter island where they dig.

1784
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:32,310
There's some expeditions that they've 
done where they've dug out around the 

1785
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,250
statues and dug deep down and you could 
see arms.

1786
01:19:34,251 --> 01:19:36,230
It's more than just ahead.
Well the one,

1787
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:38,300
the photo that had on the instagram 
there with Claudia,

1788
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:43,301
she,
he's sitting next to you go to this 

1789
01:19:43,301 --> 01:19:43,301
thing,
goes all the way down.

1790
01:19:43,301 --> 01:19:43,800
She his hands,
his arms,

1791
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:44,570
the big one.
Yeah.

1792
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,580
That's a big one,
but that's real,

1793
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:51,581
right.
I personally didn't see that was from 

1794
01:19:51,581 --> 01:19:53,780
the Ucla,
but there is what I was describing where

1795
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:54,920
the one picture I have it.
Claudio.

1796
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:58,160
He's got a whole heap that got knocked 
over by a tsunami and he's put them back

1797
01:19:58,161 --> 01:20:03,161
up and they're full ones with.
They basically standing up with their 

1798
01:20:03,161 --> 01:20:03,161
hands over their belly.
Yeah.

1799
01:20:03,161 --> 01:20:03,650
Like that.
So you have the.

1800
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,270
Well,
with the top hat on top,

1801
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:10,330
what is that?
One of the upper left Jamie with heads 

1802
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:10,330
about.
Yeah,

1803
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:10,330
right

1804
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:10,330
there.
What the hell is that?

1805
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:10,330
That's fake,
right?

1806
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:10,510
Right.
Yeah,

1807
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,120
yeah.
Feel like yoga.

1808
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:13,680
Don't get me wrong.
The first question,

1809
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:14,850
when I got there,
the first question,

1810
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:18,000
I was like bodies underneath and first 
question,

1811
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,490
but um,
they to help because they didn't want to

1812
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:25,230
dig crazy.
Gringos sorts of politics always,

1813
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,320
always with anything like this is their 
crazy politics.

1814
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:33,440
Is it hard when you go to these,
these communities because you want to 

1815
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,730
respect their cultures and their way,
but you also want to kind of get to the 

1816
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:39,840
bottom of these things as much as you 
can in a brief amount of time.

1817
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,480
I suppose.
How do I attack that one?

1818
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,080
Um,
I,

1819
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,820
I suppose when you get the expert on 
board,

1820
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:46,860
you know,
and then you get to hear about all these

1821
01:20:46,861 --> 01:20:51,861
sort of stuff.
But I guess most people going through 

1822
01:20:51,861 --> 01:20:53,751
here wouldn't hear half the stuff that 
we learn about because you don't have 

1823
01:20:53,751 --> 01:20:53,910
that world experts sitting there.

1824
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,670
You've got just some random two guide or
something like that.

1825
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:02,270
So there's a lot to it and I know with 
Claudio he had epic battles with the 

1826
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:02,990
alternate because he just wanted to 
restore,

1827
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:07,991
it was just a big pile of them piled up 
and he wanted to come in here with a 

1828
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:08,530
crane and put them all back to how they 
were and yeah,

1829
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:12,600
the amount of flack and backlash and 
trouble that he went through over,

1830
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:14,760
I think it was more than five years to 
do it.

1831
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:20,330
So unfortunate.
But that happens in so many of these 

1832
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:20,550
places where they want to sort of 
preserve the narrative,

1833
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:22,770
like they have a narrative and they've 
been,

1834
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:27,060
you know,
giving these speeches and they have this

1835
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:32,061
idea of a timeline,
how everything was done and when new 

1836
01:21:32,061 --> 01:21:32,190
evidence comes along,
very,

1837
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:35,370
very reluctant to accept it.
You find that a lot in Egypt.

1838
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,770
Well,
I mean he's the guy that wrote 20 papers

1839
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:40,440
about that particular narrative and 
you've just come over and say,

1840
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:43,880
oh actually that's all wrong.
Or different aspects of it.

1841
01:21:43,881 --> 01:21:48,881
Of course they're gonna bring it up and 
it's a lot of pushback is the coolest 

1842
01:21:48,881 --> 01:21:52,640
like that.
What I found very interesting about 

1843
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,880
Australia was the birdman culture.
Yes,

1844
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:55,110
go into it though,
please.

1845
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:58,020
So you've got this,
this culture with statues and stuff,

1846
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:00,630
and then that culture actually kind of 
died out,

1847
01:22:00,631 --> 01:22:05,631
but it definitely went out of favor and 
then you had the birdman culture come 

1848
01:22:05,631 --> 01:22:06,140
into it and that was the last one to be 
there.

1849
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:11,480
When you know,
at Western civilization kind of turned 

1850
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:14,091
up and that was crazy.
It was a competition every year where 

1851
01:22:14,091 --> 01:22:16,980
they would all run,
swim out to another island,

1852
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:22,010
down a steep cliff.
Holly would die in the process and try 

1853
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:25,611
and get the first egg,
basically the first egg from the turns 

1854
01:22:25,611 --> 01:22:25,680
there and then have to bring it all the 
way back in.

1855
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,290
The first one back with his egg was then
the,

1856
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,720
I guess some sort of analogy would be 
Jesus basically,

1857
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:37,900
but you know,
somewhere he's the God basically and,

1858
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,450
and so,
but his manner,

1859
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:43,380
his energy was then far too powerful for
anyone to have any contact with him.

1860
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:47,880
So He's as winning his prize was he 
would go live in a little hut by himself

1861
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:50,430
for the rest of the year.
He wasn't allowed to cut his fingernails

1862
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,660
or hear anything for a year and then 
they can come back.

1863
01:22:54,661 --> 01:22:59,661
But his group,
his tribe would then be the leaders of 

1864
01:22:59,661 --> 01:22:59,880
the island.
Okay.

1865
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:02,100
So basically all the different groups 
would.

1866
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:07,400
Every year they're changeover who's in 
control and that will keep everyone 

1867
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,321
happy.
So there wasn't one particular group 

1868
01:23:10,321 --> 01:23:10,321
that was in charge of everything.
It,

1869
01:23:10,321 --> 01:23:12,490
it varied based on who won the Birdman 
and competition that year,

1870
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:15,820
how they came up with that.
I have no idea.

1871
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:20,050
It's so bizarre.
There's so many weird styles of culture,

1872
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:23,020
like the way people decide to run their 
stuff.

1873
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,380
Yeah.
So strange.

1874
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,550
Like how the hell does that ever come 
about where everyone agrees.

1875
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:29,020
All right,
the dude who gets the egg,

1876
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:32,260
you're Jesus,
you got to live by yourself.

1877
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:37,650
So it's like I don't want to live by 
myself and he probably doesn't want to 

1878
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:38,620
live by himself either.
So it's like a bittersweet victory.

1879
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:41,380
A GAM Jesus.
But now I can't even cut my fingernails.

1880
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,450
I got to live in a fucking hut by 
myself,

1881
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:47,560
but I'm full of so much manner.
Well,

1882
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:52,590
there's so many really uber bizarre 
cultural traditions all around the 

1883
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:56,821
world.
I'm sure you're aware of the semen 

1884
01:23:56,821 --> 01:23:58,140
warriors in New Guinea semen.
Yes.

1885
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,380
Now I've traveled extensively through 
puppeting Guinea.

1886
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:01,630
You'll have to enlighten.

1887
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:04,220
Oh,
it's awful.

1888
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:09,310
It's essentially a culture of child 
molestation where they take children 

1889
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:15,040
from the time they're very young and 
they moved them away from their mother 

1890
01:24:15,411 --> 01:24:20,411
and they move into these bachelor groups
and they have these older men and these 

1891
01:24:20,691 --> 01:24:25,370
younger boys and they essentially tell 
these younger boys that the only way for

1892
01:24:25,371 --> 01:24:30,371
them to grow up and be strong,
and we're talking about a culture that 

1893
01:24:30,371 --> 01:24:33,020
says thousands and thousands of members,
the only way for them to grow up and be 

1894
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:36,761
strong is to ingest semen so they have 
to ingest it orally and annually and it 

1895
01:24:37,161 --> 01:24:41,820
is a an ancient tradition of these semen
warriors in New Guinea and they have.

1896
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:47,110
They've grown up being molested and then
molesting new children as they come up 

1897
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:52,230
and it's homosexual molestation and 
stuff.

1898
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,030
Yeah,
I mean it's.

1899
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:58,060
This is documented,
this is not like something I'll make on 

1900
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:58,060
that

1901
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,240
crazy stuff pumping to Guinea.
I spent a lot of time in asthma and 

1902
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:00,240
region,
which actually is in Papa New Guinea,

1903
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,600
Indonesia,
but let's not go there.

1904
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:04,130
You see anything about that Jamie?
Yeah.

1905
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:07,870
I found something on wikipedia called 
the Toro tribe.

1906
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:13,350
It's really dark man.
They think it extended their life for 

1907
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:19,290
homosexual sex prolongs life and 
heterosexual relationships are focused 

1908
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:19,690
towards reproduction.

1909
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:24,820
Yeah.
And then also it makes the young men 

1910
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,130
strong.
They think the only way for them to grow

1911
01:25:25,131 --> 01:25:27,440
and become strong as by adjusting semen

1912
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:32,330
only 20 years ago in the Hazmat region,
they were head hunters.

1913
01:25:32,331 --> 01:25:34,250
They were cannibals,
I mean end to say,

1914
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:39,430
oh,
there's no cannibalism anymore is kind 

1915
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:41,291
of a bit of a lie as well.
There still cannibalism in Papa New 

1916
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:42,260
Guinea just deleted each other,
not out front row center,

1917
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:46,280
but they keep it offline basically to 
keep it off of youtube.

1918
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,020
Um,
but yeah,

1919
01:25:48,021 --> 01:25:50,840
there's some crazy stuff going on there,
especially in the Hazmat region.

1920
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:56,530
I spent quite a bit of time there and 
what I find interesting is you got this 

1921
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:58,520
culture as old as the aboriginals in 
Australia,

1922
01:25:58,521 --> 01:25:59,870
you know,
we're talking 60,000

1923
01:25:59,871 --> 01:26:01,940
years old,
very old culture,

1924
01:26:01,941 --> 01:26:05,390
living in perfect harmony nature in the 
mangroves there and they're not even,

1925
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,570
they're not even stone people that just 
would.

1926
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:12,610
People you know,
they don't even have anything and then 

1927
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:12,610
now you have,
it's,

1928
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:16,240
it's an Indonesian province and you have
a lot of mosques being built and a lot 

1929
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,560
of stuff that's kind of creeping in.

1930
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,560
Western civilization is creeping in and 
the most disgusting thing I saw is that 

1931
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,360
they,
they've always gone down to the market 

1932
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:28,360
and bought some food and it's in wrapped
in banana leaf.

1933
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,420
They eat the food and they throw the 
banana leaf off the board,

1934
01:26:30,421 --> 01:26:34,910
walk into the water.
Now the mercantile empires now in there,

1935
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:39,911
you know there's lots of other people,
a Chinese Japanese coming in and being 

1936
01:26:39,911 --> 01:26:41,180
merchants and they sell everything in 
plastic,

1937
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:43,820
single use packets and so the same 
thing.

1938
01:26:43,821 --> 01:26:45,290
There's no garbage bins,
there's nothing around.

1939
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:46,460
They open it,
they eat the food,

1940
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:51,461
they throw the plastic over there is a 
meter and a half to two meters of just 

1941
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:54,410
piles of plastic everywhere.
Absolutely everywhere because they don't

1942
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:56,990
have any ability that I've got no 
education on it.

1943
01:26:56,991 --> 01:27:01,670
They've got no garbage collection and 
it's bloody disgusting.

1944
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:06,700
Like it's crazy that you go to a beach 
scene in Australia and you'll see one or

1945
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:08,210
two bits of plastic and like,
oh,

1946
01:27:08,211 --> 01:27:09,410
this is terrible.
When you pick it up,

1947
01:27:09,411 --> 01:27:14,411
you go there and you're like,
I need like 50 dump trucks to even get 

1948
01:27:14,411 --> 01:27:14,930
it.
Stop on this.

1949
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:20,560
The plastic problem in the ocean is huge
and it's not until you kind of get go 

1950
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,011
through Indonesia.
Even the Maldives Seychelles so much 

1951
01:27:24,011 --> 01:27:26,900
plastic everywhere and it's like meter 
high in places.

1952
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:32,220
Heard the Maldives is one of the primary
groups of islands that are at risk of a 

1953
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:34,810
global warming of being.

1954
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:40,250
The highest point on the capital in the 
Maltese is two meters high.

1955
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,360
Whoa.
Yeah.

1956
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,910
When the tsunami in 2004 came,
it went over the entire island.

1957
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:48,850
I think it was only a little tiny patch 
that didn't have seawater go over it.

1958
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:53,910
It's crazy.
I've got a picture on the instagram is 

1959
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:53,910
one of the first pictures ever put up 
there.

1960
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:56,560
All of the capital and you'll see it's 
something like 250,000

1961
01:27:56,561 --> 01:28:01,210
people in a tiny little island and it's 
shocking like there.

1962
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:02,800
They're serious,
just pumped straight out.

1963
01:28:02,801 --> 01:28:07,801
There's another island next to it that's
the garbage island where they just take 

1964
01:28:07,801 --> 01:28:07,990
all the garbage and burn it.
So it's this constant,

1965
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:11,260
massive fire on the nearest island where
they just burn garbage.

1966
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:14,710
It's environmental catastrophe

1967
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:18,570
that went through that.
That's the Maldives?

1968
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,510
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1969
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:23,390
But this is Indonesia,
Papua New Guinea.

1970
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:27,020
Like oh my God.
That picture.

1971
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:29,820
So disturbing.
That first picture,

1972
01:28:29,821 --> 01:28:34,821
Jamie,
go back to that first one that you 

1973
01:28:34,821 --> 01:28:34,821
posted.
Oh my God.

1974
01:28:34,821 --> 01:28:37,180
Yeah.
That is God damned insane.

1975
01:28:37,181 --> 01:28:37,230
Yeah,

1976
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:42,260
no,
they were on these tours and we would 

1977
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,651
actually spend the first hour before 
guests come over just cleaning up 

1978
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:47,490
plastic and then the first guest to come
over with generally help us clean 

1979
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:47,490
plastics as well,
and we would take back 10,

1980
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:51,070
20 bags of garbage just so you could 
walk along a little bit of the beach and

1981
01:28:51,071 --> 01:28:51,970
not have plastic everywhere.

1982
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:54,620
Oh my God.
That's horrible.

1983
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,010
Wow.
When you,

1984
01:28:59,011 --> 01:29:01,680
when you see the sheer numbers game,
Jamie,

1985
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:02,010
what was

1986
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:07,050
your google search so people could check
out these images that are listening to 

1987
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:07,440
this plastic island?
Oh,

1988
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:14,060
that's so horrific.
It's an entire island is just covered 

1989
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:17,970
with shit plastic.
Wow.

1990
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,860
People are so quick and they're just 
finding it.

1991
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,840
That's the only way they can do anything
about it.

1992
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:25,740
It was burning and that's the only 
250,000

1993
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:26,520
people.
Right?

1994
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:28,470
Well that's the capital.
I'm leery of that.

1995
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,380
Oh my God.
Jamie capital.

1996
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:32,070
And I think it's one of the first images
that have.

1997
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,540
Look at that photo of the capital.
Yeah.

1998
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,730
I was cruising past and I,
I took a picture with a,

1999
01:29:38,731 --> 01:29:43,731
um,
with a drone at sunset and it's quite 

2000
01:29:43,731 --> 01:29:43,731
pitcher.
I quite like it.

2001
01:29:43,731 --> 01:29:47,460
Um,
but you just see the amount of people 

2002
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,440
packed into this tiny little space and 
they've just got,

2003
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:52,740
they've got no means to recycle,
do anything about it.

2004
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:57,741
It's,
and it's probably got a couple of 

2005
01:29:57,741 --> 01:29:58,770
decades and then it'll be all those 
people have to go somewhere else.

2006
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:04,310
You know,
I always feel like I want to fly over 

2007
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:04,310
Honolulu,
Honolulu.

2008
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:05,840
It's like so strange because the Hawaii,
you know,

2009
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,020
a Wahoo,
I guess it is,

2010
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:10,860
has a million people on it and it's not 
that big man.

2011
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:13,020
It's not that big at all.
Is that it right there?

2012
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:18,021
You flew over and took the top photo.
I think Jamie's trying to still trying 

2013
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:23,781
to find it.
I think it would actually go to 

2014
01:30:23,781 --> 01:30:27,100
scrolling or something.
Some reason his instagram pages and 

2015
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:27,100
letting me see past this last like 10 
pictures I have to do.

2016
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:28,600
There you go.
It's up on the screen now.

2017
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,020
Unless you want to bring that up.
There you go.

2018
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,880
Oh Wow.
Oh my God.

2019
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,920
That's insane.
It's insane,

2020
01:30:34,921 --> 01:30:39,921
isn't it?
Like how do people think this is 

2021
01:30:39,921 --> 01:30:42,081
sustainable?
Like let's just build a massive city on 

2022
01:30:42,081 --> 01:30:42,081
a tiny little island with no food.

2023
01:30:42,081 --> 01:30:42,081
There's no food.
Everything's important.

2024
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:44,160
They had a water crisis.
I think it was last year.

2025
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,110
They had to import all.
If all the water.

2026
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:49,920
This is on your instagram that people 
could see that visit.

2027
01:30:49,921 --> 01:30:52,310
There's a shot on the instagram,
so that's.

2028
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:57,830
That's chaotic.
It seems like one of the worst 

2029
01:30:57,830 --> 01:31:01,581
engineered civilizations ever and so 
there's no what we're looking at folks 

2030
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:02,490
with the people that are just listening 
to this,

2031
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:06,000
which is most of the people we're 
looking at like a small island,

2032
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:11,001
not very big because you can see the 
entire thing and it's filled with 

2033
01:31:11,001 --> 01:31:14,040
buildings.
There's no nothing but buildings.

2034
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:16,230
It doesn't agree with any parks in 
there.

2035
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:19,620
I mean there's like a few field or 
something like patches of green,

2036
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:24,650
like very small,
but most of it is just stacked 

2037
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:26,070
buildings.
Yeah,

2038
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:28,230
I mean it brings.
Whenever I look at this,

2039
01:31:28,231 --> 01:31:29,970
I just think of suburbia,
same thing,

2040
01:31:29,971 --> 01:31:34,971
like we all live in these little patches
of land that if we wanted to grow her 

2041
01:31:34,971 --> 01:31:35,280
own food,
we couldn't support ourselves.

2042
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,870
We couldn't support anything.
Well,

2043
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:39,600
this is an argument for the asshole that
used to run Australia.

2044
01:31:39,601 --> 01:31:40,620
Right?
The guy had it,

2045
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:41,120
right?
Yeah.

2046
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:43,680
Don't let everybody come and ruin your 
beautiful party.

2047
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:48,950
You guys have a beautiful party.
You have a continental United States 

2048
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:50,520
with as many people as Los Angeles.
Yep.

2049
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,160
But you have some spots where you can't 
really live.

2050
01:31:53,161 --> 01:31:53,940
Right.
That's what I mean.

2051
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:58,941
The whole interior is his death.
Livable people have massive out there.

2052
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:00,250
Well,
China

2053
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,350
owns massive ranchers out there.
China does.

2054
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,570
That's a good one to bring up,
Jamie,

2055
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:07,690
where there's a map of Australia and 
Chinese ownership.

2056
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,060
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

2057
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:13,210
We have sold.
We've sold a huge farms,

2058
01:32:13,211 --> 01:32:18,211
these massive,
massive farms in central Australia to 

2059
01:32:18,211 --> 01:32:20,610
China over the last five years or so.
One of the farms growing cattle,

2060
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,210
whatever it mainly,
mainly it's kind of a livestock.

2061
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:29,520
And are these Chinese folks taking these
cattle and importing the beef in China 

2062
01:32:29,741 --> 01:32:32,680
or like most of it will go straight to 
China basically.

2063
01:32:32,681 --> 01:32:37,681
Wow.
So they just decided to buy some land 

2064
01:32:37,681 --> 01:32:38,410
and grow some cows in a new spot.
Well we were already growing cows there,

2065
01:32:38,411 --> 01:32:43,411
but yeah,
they just bought them and then export 

2066
01:32:43,411 --> 01:32:45,031
them to China.
But the just the sheer area is what's 

2067
01:32:45,031 --> 01:32:48,130
crazy.
I'm looking for pictures of the thing.

2068
01:32:48,131 --> 01:32:53,131
But this is a block the size of an Ohio 
sized ranch that's just the latest one 

2069
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:59,700
block the sale of a massive private 
cattle ranch to foreign buyer saying it 

2070
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,280
was contrary to the national interest.

2071
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:03,290
Mm.
Well I mean like it.

2072
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:05,970
On one hand you'd say,
well hey that's,

2073
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,940
that's Zena phobic and it's awful and 
why would you do that?

2074
01:33:09,941 --> 01:33:13,180
But if you want to keep it the way it 
is,

2075
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:15,190
it's really no other way.
Right.

2076
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,560
I just think,
you know,

2077
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:21,690
the,
at the moment we as an Australian 

2078
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:22,810
people,
we don't get any real benefit from that.

2079
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:26,140
We don't the profits go overseas or the 
product produce goes overseas.

2080
01:33:26,141 --> 01:33:28,060
We're not really seeing any benefit for 
it.

2081
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:29,350
And that's,
you know,

2082
01:33:29,351 --> 01:33:30,700
if we,
if we didn't sell it,

2083
01:33:30,701 --> 01:33:33,700
if we leased it,
completely agree at least that stuff,

2084
01:33:33,701 --> 01:33:34,400
whatever,
you know,

2085
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:39,500
but we should,
the Australian people should retain 

2086
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,080
ownership of that because I mean if ever
do find the map,

2087
01:33:41,081 --> 01:33:43,510
it's of course the colors and red to 
make it scary.

2088
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,250
And then it's a lot of Australia,
a billionaire buys $47,000,000

2089
01:33:48,251 --> 01:33:51,370
worth of Australian cattle ranches to 
feed China's hunger for beef.

2090
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:57,010
China's nuts.
What a crazy place.

2091
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:58,990
It's uh,
it's interesting.

2092
01:33:59,140 --> 01:33:59,930
Definitely.
Yeah.

2093
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:01,100
Well it's,
it's,

2094
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:03,430
it's,
I mean again,

2095
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:08,580
the different styles of culture that we 
find the different styles of the way 

2096
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:13,381
human beings exist and coexist on this 
planet as one of the weirder aspects of 

2097
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:18,160
traveling that you see what's normal to 
these people.

2098
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:18,910
Oh,
it's different.

2099
01:34:18,911 --> 01:34:22,240
Every country you could everywhere and 
they accept it.

2100
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:27,300
It's like this is our normal.
What I like about China is that when it 

2101
01:34:27,731 --> 01:34:32,731
makes the decision on something,
it's looking 40 years in the future 

2102
01:34:32,731 --> 01:34:33,040
because it's by committee.
You know,

2103
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:36,400
when we in Australia or the states,
you know,

2104
01:34:36,401 --> 01:34:38,860
we make a decision based on the election
cycle.

2105
01:34:38,861 --> 01:34:42,910
It's based in what can we get four years
time and that's where I think China will

2106
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:47,911
actually leapfrog a lot of western 
society because what they're doing now 

2107
01:34:47,911 --> 01:34:51,631
is thinking about in 40 years time.
So they're building big infrastructure 

2108
01:34:51,631 --> 01:34:55,920
before it's even required.
Where we in the Western world seem to 

2109
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,140
just have crumbling infrastructure.
Yeah.

2110
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:58,400
Yeah.
We seem to be looking

2111
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:01,370
like for years we looked like election 
cycles.

2112
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:04,430
Your elections,
crazy luck in your election.

2113
01:35:04,431 --> 01:35:07,520
Goes on for like two years in Australia,
that guy we're going to have an election

2114
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,790
in 30 days time.
They'd go back and forth for 30 days.

2115
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:12,500
We have an election,
30 days.

2116
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:13,520
That's it.
Problem solved.

2117
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:15,320
We had to stare at the people for 
Awhile,

2118
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:20,440
chip away at their armor,
try to find out what the fuck came for 

2119
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:20,810
like two years.
I mean that's just.

2120
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:23,360
Yeah,
it's messed up.

2121
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,190
It is messed up.
Well,

2122
01:35:25,191 --> 01:35:30,191
it's also nobody really that you would 
want to be president wants to be 

2123
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:30,470
president,
you know?

2124
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,510
Ideally you would want.
So why is that?

2125
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:34,700
Well,
because they dig into your personal life

2126
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:35,600
too much,
man.

2127
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:37,130
They,
they start fucking with your family.

2128
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:39,230
You start fucking with your finances and
fucking with.

2129
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:44,530
They started interviewing people you 
went to high school with and trying to 

2130
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,931
chip away at any one possible moral 
issue you may or may not have had that 

2131
01:35:47,421 --> 01:35:52,421
they can blow up and sticking your face 
and you're down to these like you get 

2132
01:35:52,421 --> 01:35:55,190
like egomaniacs,
like trump or massively religious people

2133
01:35:55,191 --> 01:35:57,950
like Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.

2134
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:01,400
This is,
and I don't understand Marco Rubio,

2135
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,970
he's,
he's,

2136
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:07,030
he's an odd one.
And then you get Hillary Clinton who is 

2137
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:09,731
essentially a lifelong politician who 
has been so deeply embedded into the 

2138
01:36:09,951 --> 01:36:14,180
system that she isn't a massively low 
trust rate.

2139
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:15,610
Like the truck,
the wrist,

2140
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:18,560
it's like 37 percent of people trust 
her.

2141
01:36:19,110 --> 01:36:21,290
This is crazy.
I mean that's crazy.

2142
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:23,990
Sixty three percent of like no fucking 
way.

2143
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:26,150
The vast majority,
you know,

2144
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,960
the obvious majority at least are.
They're like,

2145
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:30,470
I don't trust her at all.
And then they,

2146
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:31,880
you know,
they have to.

2147
01:36:32,010 --> 01:36:35,030
So we have to see Joe Rogan for prison.
No fucking way.

2148
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:36,390
I wouldn't want that job.
It's.

2149
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:38,660
It's a terrible job.
Like it's a thing.

2150
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:42,110
First of all,
what I honestly believe is that the idea

2151
01:36:42,111 --> 01:36:47,111
is massively archaic and I think the 
idea of having this one alpha primate 

2152
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:51,410
that runs the tribe was fine if there's 
100 people,

2153
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:56,510
but the idea of 300 million people being
run by this one figurehead is nuts.

2154
01:36:56,690 --> 01:36:58,610
It doesn't work anymore.
It's stupid.

2155
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:02,660
What we should have is the president 
should be like the queen of England.

2156
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,730
Some goofball gets out and fucking 
bulletproof popemobile and drives around

2157
01:37:06,731 --> 01:37:08,030
a waves.
No one gives a shit,

2158
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:12,530
but she doesn't really dictate policy 
and I think the real president should be

2159
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:17,531
the internet.
I really believe firmly that with 

2160
01:37:17,531 --> 01:37:19,790
education and with access to information
that we're all enjoying right now,

2161
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
that maybe not now because we're in this
sort of tumultuous turmoil filled 

2162
01:37:25,311 --> 01:37:30,020
adolescent period,
but I think that as we get more and more

2163
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,920
deeply embedded in the idea of 
exchanging information,

2164
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:37,040
I think we're going to be able to read 
each other's minds.

2165
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:42,160
We're going to be able to tap into 
instantaneous information directly to 

2166
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:46,691
our mind and we're going to realize that
the only way this is all going to work 

2167
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:52,361
out is if we don't allow anyone to abuse
the environment for the sake of profit,

2168
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,880
that we don't allow anyone to take life 
for the sake of profit,

2169
01:37:56,881 --> 01:38:01,881
that we don't allow anyone to lie to us 
about their motives for invading 

2170
01:38:01,881 --> 01:38:06,201
countries or for for dictating certain 
policy and especially for influencing 

2171
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,370
other countries in the fall for the 
reason of profit.

2172
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,230
We've got to.
We've got to stop that.

2173
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:18,350
We got to figure out a way to stop that 
and the only way to stop that is full 

2174
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:20,130
disclosure amongst our leader and his 
parents.

2175
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:24,960
Massive transparency and I think that's 
going to happen in a natural way because

2176
01:38:24,961 --> 01:38:27,330
I think it's going to be unavoidable.
I think in the future,

2177
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:32,390
like what you're seeing now.
I think one of the reasons why you've 

2178
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:33,510
seen this poor group of people running 
for president is because the really rich

2179
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:38,511
and influential people that maybe would 
have run for president 20 or 30 years 

2180
01:38:38,511 --> 01:38:42,231
ago.
I like fuck that job because it's just 

2181
01:38:42,231 --> 01:38:44,250
too invasive and not only that,
once you become president,

2182
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:47,100
you have to have secret service live 
with you for the rest of your life.

2183
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:50,160
I mean you're constantly on guard.
Everywhere you go.

2184
01:38:50,161 --> 01:38:51,860
People hate you.
I mean it's,

2185
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,730
it's a crazy nut job.

2186
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:56,170
It's a job.
It's almost like a,

2187
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:01,640
you want it just because it's like this 
thing to achieve and then.

2188
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:03,210
But you,
if you look at it on paper,

2189
01:39:03,211 --> 01:39:04,100
like what,
what is.

2190
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,910
It's not like you're independently 
wealthy.

2191
01:39:05,911 --> 01:39:08,880
Once you get in,
you really make you make very good money

2192
01:39:08,881 --> 01:39:12,840
for the average person you make.
Like I think it's like 450 or $500,000

2193
01:39:12,841 --> 01:39:13,790
a year.
You know,

2194
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:18,800
you certainly a good living,
but that's not like stuff with it.

2195
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:23,010
It's not worth it then,
but they make money in the speeches.

2196
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:28,030
That's really,
that's also the really weird thing you 

2197
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:28,030
find out like how much Bill Clinton 
makes.

2198
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:31,020
Giving speeches now.
It's almost like they bribe you,

2199
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:34,950
like for,
for what your policies were in office.

2200
01:39:34,951 --> 01:39:39,951
It's sort of as only as sort of 
unwritten rule like do the right thing 

2201
01:39:39,951 --> 01:39:42,120
when you're in and then when you're out,
we'll have you come by.

2202
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:44,860
If this company to this then

2203
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:50,540
have you seen the democratic debates 
between Bernie Sanders and Hillary 

2204
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:51,630
Clinton where he asks her for these 
transcripts?

2205
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:53,190
Oh,
good for you.

2206
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:57,960
You probably live in better to what does
this 150,

2207
01:39:57,961 --> 01:40:00,720
$3,000,000
in bill and Hillary Clinton speaking.

2208
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,920
Mrs Clinton was paid directly by Wall 
Street suggesting a conflict of 

2209
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:06,990
interest.
Despite a recent distancing,

2210
01:40:06,991 --> 01:40:11,700
no matter how much Mrs Clinton hopes to 
lure Bernie Sanders voters,

2211
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:15,560
it must be hard at $220,000
to 200,

2212
01:40:15,561 --> 01:40:16,680
$5,000
a pop.

2213
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:21,000
That's how much he gets paid for a 
speech and he was like,

2214
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:26,060
it must have been an amazing speech.
I'd like to see the transcript to this 

2215
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:27,690
beach.
She ain't and she not releasing those.

2216
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,850
I've got a bit of trouble for saying 
this about a year ago.

2217
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:36,320
I honestly think the whole trump 
candidacy is a conspiracy theory to make

2218
01:40:36,321 --> 01:40:41,321
hillary win because you have someone so 
crazy on that side that people go,

2219
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:43,640
all right,
okay.

2220
01:40:43,641 --> 01:40:44,390
Yeah,
we've had our fun,

2221
01:40:44,391 --> 01:40:49,391
but time to get serious and they go for 
Hillary because it's the better option 

2222
01:40:49,391 --> 01:40:51,500
of the two man where I don't fully agree
with that too.

2223
01:40:51,501 --> 01:40:53,140
The truth.
I don't think Hillary's a wonder.

2224
01:40:53,870 --> 01:40:55,510
I wonder,
but I've got to.

2225
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:56,290
I've got to start for you,
Jay.

2226
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:58,540
Okay.
On that trip to Easter island.

2227
01:40:58,541 --> 01:41:03,541
So we went from Tahiti to Easter island 
for about two weeks ago and we had um,

2228
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:07,210
had a gentleman on board who was kind of
my political hero.

2229
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,980
Uh,
his name was Bob Brown,

2230
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,350
Australian,
a senator,

2231
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:14,620
leader of the Green Party.
And so when I was growing up,

2232
01:41:14,621 --> 01:41:19,621
you'd have your talking heads,
some topic coming on and you'd have 

2233
01:41:19,621 --> 01:41:19,621
basically the Republican and the 
Democrat,

2234
01:41:19,621 --> 01:41:20,890
we call them liberals and labor,
whatever.

2235
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:24,730
And it would be stupid comment,
stupid comment.

2236
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:27,340
And then you'd have this third one,
the Greens guy.

2237
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,950
He would come on and then just say 
something that actually made sense.

2238
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:35,250
And so the whole time growing up,
he was a bit of a political hero of 

2239
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:35,250
mine,
nothing worship or anything like that.

2240
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:35,980
But I went,
you know,

2241
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:41,010
out of all the politicians,
this guy's got his head screwed on and 

2242
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:41,440
it's environmentally and progressive and
stuff like that.

2243
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:46,920
Environmentally conscious.
So he was on board is one of our guests 

2244
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,280
lecturers kind of thing.
And he did lots of talks,

2245
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:49,630
um,
fascinating,

2246
01:41:49,631 --> 01:41:54,631
fascinating guy.
And I remember I did my climate change 

2247
01:41:54,631 --> 01:41:57,451
talk and so he came up to me afterwards 
and I hadn't had a long conversation 

2248
01:41:57,451 --> 01:41:57,580
with you.
And so I went to,

2249
01:41:57,581 --> 01:41:59,050
you know,
start going,

2250
01:41:59,051 --> 01:42:00,250
oh,
big fan,

2251
01:42:00,251 --> 01:42:05,251
Yada Yada.
And he turned around and when you add 

2252
01:42:05,251 --> 01:42:05,251
them,
you,

2253
01:42:05,251 --> 01:42:07,690
you need to be in politics,
you need to be a senator for the Greens 

2254
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:07,690
in Australia.

2255
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:08,740
And he pushed it big time especially,
you've got to do this,

2256
01:42:08,741 --> 01:42:10,450
you've got to do this.
We need,

2257
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:11,900
you know,
younger people like you to do.

2258
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:14,790
And I must admit,
I thought about it because I want to not

2259
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:20,010
change the world,
but I want to do something to make this 

2260
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:20,010
earth a slightly better than what I 
arrived.

2261
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:21,940
Um,
and that's a way to do it for sure.

2262
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:26,970
The thing that keeps me back from doing 
it is I would have to put up with 

2263
01:42:26,970 --> 01:42:30,610
politicians all day who would want to 
put up with politicians,

2264
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:35,630
order.
That's what I'm miserable bunch of 

2265
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:38,041
people and I don't know,
but I haven't watched much cspan of 

2266
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:38,530
Congress and stuff over here.
But our parliament,

2267
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,840
they just sit there pitching each other 
continuously,

2268
01:42:40,841 --> 01:42:45,841
if that's totally true.
It's like the English parliament and 

2269
01:42:45,841 --> 01:42:46,750
ever seen where they'd just be using 
each other basically and yelling,

2270
01:42:46,751 --> 01:42:50,080
calling each other names all the time 
when they have a vote and they don't,

2271
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:55,270
they,
they know the vote's not going to go 

2272
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:55,270
their way.

2273
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:57,240
You didn't have to have like 60 percent 
of the people there to make the vote 

2274
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:00,031
count.
They all run for the doors and try and 

2275
01:43:00,031 --> 01:43:02,371
get out before they lock the doors so 
that there's not enough people that 

2276
01:43:02,371 --> 01:43:05,180
actually actually make it past.
They just act like little school 

2277
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:05,200
children kind of run.
They run.

2278
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:08,100
Our prime minister is sprinting because 
I go to.

2279
01:43:08,101 --> 01:43:10,780
The doors are going to be locked in two 
minutes and he's Brinton out of his seat

2280
01:43:10,781 --> 01:43:12,640
to get out that door because we get to 
that that door.

2281
01:43:12,641 --> 01:43:17,641
Then he doesn't vote and there's not 
enough votes and then it doesn't go 

2282
01:43:17,641 --> 01:43:17,790
through.
It's just like we paying these people to

2283
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:21,820
represent us and they're just acting 
like little children or goofy law.

2284
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:23,800
Why would you want to.
Why would you want to surround yourself?

2285
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:26,290
Imagine waking up everyday and 
surrounding yourself with that.

2286
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:32,010
I think we'd be way better off if 
individual human beings across the 

2287
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:34,990
board,
like the giant mass of us,

2288
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:40,170
if we all,
everyone adult had a say instead of an 

2289
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:42,430
elected government,
a representative government.

2290
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:45,760
If we all had to say and we we'd have to
come up with one zero.

2291
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,110
A real.
Exactly.

2292
01:43:47,111 --> 01:43:52,111
That's a great way of pointing it out.
I think the representative government 

2293
01:43:52,111 --> 01:43:55,921
was great idea back in the day when it 
was impossible to communicate with each 

2294
01:43:55,921 --> 01:43:55,921
other.
We don't need it anymore.

2295
01:43:55,921 --> 01:43:55,921
We don't need it.

2296
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:58,560
Two point zero.
There was a gentleman potty,

2297
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:03,750
they.
They tried to do it and you know that 

2298
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:05,580
were quite successful but didn't get 
elected into power so it couldn't do it,

2299
01:44:05,581 --> 01:44:07,350
but their idea was to use two point 
zero.

2300
01:44:07,351 --> 01:44:10,080
We just make a website and you've got 
whatever issue we're voting on.

2301
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:15,380
Everyone can vote and and where I think 
they went wrong because this is 

2302
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:18,210
something I've thought about quite 
considerably is where they went wrong is

2303
01:44:18,211 --> 01:44:19,260
they're trying to change the whole 
system.

2304
01:44:19,261 --> 01:44:20,250
So the gun,
we're going to come in,

2305
01:44:20,251 --> 01:44:22,110
we're gonna change the whole system and 
people freak out.

2306
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,630
Then of course,
so I feel it.

2307
01:44:24,631 --> 01:44:29,631
Hang on.
Is there a way to achieve the same goal 

2308
01:44:29,631 --> 01:44:31,440
but through the nonprofit angle instead 
of trying to change the whole thing,

2309
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:36,680
and so it's something I started on,
I started working on and it's been put 

2310
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,740
to the sidelines because I travel the 
world and I'm busy,

2311
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:41,490
but earth vote.network
where you had a place where you could go

2312
01:44:41,491 --> 01:44:46,491
and vote like a petition,
but it's that one question that you 

2313
01:44:46,491 --> 01:44:50,241
answer stays on forever and so then 
because in Australia all the time you 

2314
01:44:50,241 --> 01:44:52,830
pick up a Murdoch newspaper and it'll 
say 94 percent of Australians think this

2315
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:58,160
and then you read down the bottom out of
a survey of a 500 people ringing 

2316
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,010
landlines in one suburb in Sydney.

2317
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:04,010
I'm like,
that's not a representation of what's 

2318
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:04,010
going on.
Imagine if I could turn around and go,

2319
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:07,290
here's half a million people and he is 
the percentage of what they think.

2320
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:09,960
Then you're getting a more accurate 
representation of what's going on.

2321
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:14,610
I think there's room for a website like 
that and obviously I've kind of given up

2322
01:45:14,611 --> 01:45:16,920
on doing it myself,
hence why I'm mentioning it right now.

2323
01:45:16,921 --> 01:45:21,921
Hopefully someone else takes it up,
but there's huge potential in taking 

2324
01:45:21,921 --> 01:45:26,601
clicktivism,
which we currently see on facebook and 

2325
01:45:26,601 --> 01:45:28,731
everything.
Everyone's happy to click on a link and 

2326
01:45:28,731 --> 01:45:28,860
spread the good word about some 
environmental concern,

2327
01:45:28,861 --> 01:45:31,410
but actually do something they're not so
willing to do.

2328
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:37,430
If you collate all that clicktivism into
one spot and then you have data coming 

2329
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:39,780
out of it,
it actually becomes useful with actually

2330
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:41,730
can be used where you can go to a 
politician,

2331
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:42,210
say,
hey,

2332
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:45,840
80 percent of your electric think this 
so your represent them.

2333
01:45:45,930 --> 01:45:50,930
Go do it and you've got some way.
And then the other aspect to it is to 

2334
01:45:51,001 --> 01:45:53,880
then actually do a kind of vote,
not voting.

2335
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:57,750
Um,
keep a system of the politicians.

2336
01:45:57,751 --> 01:46:02,751
So say 80 percent of Australia thinks 
this things and then the politician,

2337
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:05,460
the votes for a bill that's against 
that.

2338
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:07,590
Then you give them a minus one point,
they vote for it,

2339
01:46:07,591 --> 01:46:09,150
you get an a plus one point,
you know.

2340
01:46:09,151 --> 01:46:14,151
And so eventually you would work out 
basically which politicians are 

2341
01:46:14,151 --> 01:46:15,930
accurately representing their 
constituents and which ones are not.

2342
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:21,230
And that's what we don't have.
How do you know that this guy that 

2343
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:21,750
you're voting for has been representing 
the constituents?

2344
01:46:21,751 --> 01:46:26,751
You don't really know.
You've got to go back and look through 

2345
01:46:26,751 --> 01:46:26,751
10 years of newspaper articles and try 
and deduce it.

2346
01:46:26,751 --> 01:46:28,770
Imagine if you could formulate that into
a website,

2347
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,480
you.
It'd be a pretty powerful thing.

2348
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:33,120
It'd be a very powerful thing.
I think that's the future.

2349
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:35,520
I think the future,
as we were saying,

2350
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:38,630
as we get more access to,
you know,

2351
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:44,240
the way people are influenced,
when we understand where the money's 

2352
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:46,970
actually coming from,
which is way more today than it's ever 

2353
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:47,670
been in the past 30,
40 years ago.

2354
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:52,850
It was really difficult to out what was 
motivating certain presidents or people 

2355
01:46:52,850 --> 01:46:57,111
that were candidates and you only got to
see what they were projecting in front 

2356
01:46:57,111 --> 01:46:57,900
of the television what they were.
That's why debates are important.

2357
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,020
You get to see the way they spoke and 
debates.

2358
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:03,260
Try to decipher and peel through it,
but no,

2359
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:06,360
we never had the kind of transparency 
that we have today and this is

2360
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,470
you want to know what's really going on 
with a politician.

2361
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:12,160
Get them on the Joe Rogan podcast,
get politician for three hours.

2362
01:47:12,161 --> 01:47:17,161
They accomplish it for that long.
That would be at some point you would 

2363
01:47:17,161 --> 01:47:18,190
get under them and you would find out 
what's actually going to do.

2364
01:47:18,191 --> 01:47:21,760
A lot of research though that,
so I couldn't just have mom like you and

2365
01:47:21,761 --> 01:47:23,290
just go,
let's talk man.

2366
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:26,310
I would have to go deep,
but yeah,

2367
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:30,030
you get someone to talk for long periods
of time uncensored like that.

2368
01:47:30,031 --> 01:47:31,950
Without commercial breaks,
without moderators.

2369
01:47:31,951 --> 01:47:36,951
Then you're going to get to see him.
These debates that they have are so 

2370
01:47:36,951 --> 01:47:39,591
ridiculous.
One person says something ridiculous to 

2371
01:47:39,591 --> 01:47:39,591
see Bernie Sanders raising his hand when
he disagrees,

2372
01:47:39,591 --> 01:47:44,270
waiting to have his turn and then she's 
talking over and then he talks over and 

2373
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:46,380
you're running out of time,
but let me finish my point.

2374
01:47:46,381 --> 01:47:46,950
And he goes,
oh,

2375
01:47:46,990 --> 01:47:47,810
it's like the,
the,

2376
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:51,660
the method of distributing information 
is archaic.

2377
01:47:51,661 --> 01:47:53,600
It's not necessary anymore.
You know,

2378
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:58,610
they should,
they should have some sort of a free 

2379
01:47:58,610 --> 01:47:58,610
form,
free form conversation.

2380
01:47:58,610 --> 01:48:02,310
It's available online where people can 
watch it and you know,

2381
01:48:02,311 --> 01:48:05,460
you have someone who was entertaining 
that understands politics,

2382
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:10,070
run them through it and just give some 
sort of a,

2383
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:15,200
a real detailed view to the American 
people of who these people are and what 

2384
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:20,850
they're about,
but I think they're the people that are 

2385
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:20,850
today.

2386
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:23,790
Even Bernie Sanders who's a really 
revolutionary and a lot of ways and very

2387
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:26,970
progressive in a lot of ways.
There's still a politician,

2388
01:48:27,110 --> 01:48:32,110
you know,
he's still wearing a tie and a suit and 

2389
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:33,951
all that nonsense and he's still a part 
of this weird system and he always has 

2390
01:48:33,951 --> 01:48:37,401
been,
even though he's a rebel in a lot of 

2391
01:48:37,401 --> 01:48:39,801
ways,
but I think they're going to be like 

2392
01:48:39,801 --> 01:48:39,801
those people that are wearing powdered 
wigs and those ancient pictures.

2393
01:48:39,801 --> 01:48:42,090
It's like it's so old.
It's so crazy.

2394
01:48:42,091 --> 01:48:45,390
Like this method of doing it,
like you have to do it this way.

2395
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:48,210
Lawyers in Australia as to where those 
weeks do they really?

2396
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,570
Yeah.
It's crazy what?

2397
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:54,680
Yep.
When you do it's magic.

2398
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:56,940
So if you go to court,
you have to wear a wig.

2399
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:02,480
The lawyer in certain certain quotes.
So if you got in trouble for something 

2400
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:07,510
that the defendant doesn't have to know,
but I'm saying your lawyer,

2401
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,230
like what the fuck am I looking at,
Jamie?

2402
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:12,090
That's a Barista.
Okay.

2403
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:16,230
So for you guys got to get on the 
fucking ball.

2404
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:20,520
You guys are crazy.
So sorry to interject.

2405
01:49:20,521 --> 01:49:21,990
But I did.
So if you get in trouble,

2406
01:49:21,991 --> 01:49:26,991
if you did something,
if you got accused of something and you 

2407
01:49:26,991 --> 01:49:29,961
hired a lawyer,
your lawyer would have to wear a wacky 

2408
01:49:29,961 --> 01:49:29,961
wig like that.
Yes.

2409
01:49:29,961 --> 01:49:33,390
Wow.
Sit in certain courts.

2410
01:49:34,190 --> 01:49:36,060
What courts?
Oh,

2411
01:49:36,061 --> 01:49:39,720
now you're stretching my memory on it.
A lot of them think it's,

2412
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:41,340
it's not a magistrate,
a barrister.

2413
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:42,510
Um,
yeah,

2414
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,130
something like that.
Good Lord.

2415
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:45,910
Definitely New South Wales and some of 
them.

2416
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:46,920
Yeah.
I actually,

2417
01:49:46,921 --> 01:49:48,100
I went to court for the first time

2418
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:51,310
last year.
First time for what?

2419
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:54,220
Uh,
I got a charged with being a terrorist.

2420
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:59,670
You did for something environmental?
I would imagine not.

2421
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:01,930
What'd you do?
I uh,

2422
01:50:01,931 --> 01:50:05,440
I went through airport security with a 
pocket knife by accident.

2423
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:07,090
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2424
01:50:07,091 --> 01:50:12,091
We in Australia.
We're a bit of a nanny state at the 

2425
01:50:12,091 --> 01:50:12,091
moment.
Uh,

2426
01:50:12,091 --> 01:50:14,991
we've brought in a lot of laws that just
ridiculous and so it used to be you go 

2427
01:50:14,991 --> 01:50:16,660
through airport security with your Swiss
army knife,

2428
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:21,280
they take it off you and they go right 
in a way you go,

2429
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:22,240
you know,
that's it.

2430
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:25,480
They changed the law two weeks before I 
went through and it was just,

2431
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:30,510
it was just a random mistake.
I had a pocket knife in with the camera 

2432
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:30,510
gear.
I had to rearrange my bank because I was

2433
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:31,520
overweight.
Um,

2434
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,240
and I put it in my carry on by mistake.

2435
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,370
I didn't realize that pocket knife is,
it's simple mistake.

2436
01:50:36,371 --> 01:50:39,010
We do it all the time and people do it 
all the time.

2437
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:40,300
And uh,
yeah,

2438
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:42,370
so they got it and I was like,
oh crap,

2439
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,600
because it's a good knife.
I was like,

2440
01:50:43,950 --> 01:50:44,480
oh,
well,

2441
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,360
whatever.
I'm late for my flight.

2442
01:50:46,361 --> 01:50:47,440
And then I went to walk away and they 
went,

2443
01:50:47,441 --> 01:50:49,630
oh,
hang on here when the Australian Federal

2444
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:50,650
Police need to speak to you.
I'm like,

2445
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:53,590
oh my God.
So the police came over and they were,

2446
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:58,620
they were trying to give me off on a 
course and they were ringing their 

2447
01:50:58,620 --> 01:50:58,810
superior and trying to get me caught 
because I could see clear as day that is

2448
01:50:58,811 --> 01:51:02,290
just stupid mistake.
And the supplier said,

2449
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:02,590
no,
no,

2450
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:04,960
that's the laws change,
they have to go to court now.

2451
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:09,730
And so I was charged with possession of 
a deadly weapon basically with intent to

2452
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:14,760
hijack and aircraft and it cost me 
thousands of dollars because it wasn't 

2453
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,070
the airport I got done.

2454
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:21,100
It was about 2000 kilometers away from 
where I live.

2455
01:51:21,101 --> 01:51:24,670
So I had to travel back there and then I
had to get a lawyer,

2456
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:27,190
which was just hilarious.
I pay a thousand dollars.

2457
01:51:27,191 --> 01:51:29,230
He didn't even show up.
He sent someone else,

2458
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:31,520
gave me a call half an hour beforehand.
Um,

2459
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:33,700
yeah,
everything was just like.

2460
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:36,430
And so I was,
I knew more about the law than he did.

2461
01:51:36,431 --> 01:51:39,640
But anyway.
And so then the substitute lawyer?

2462
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:41,080
Yeah.
Oh God.

2463
01:51:41,081 --> 01:51:42,550
I knew more about the actual 
legislation.

2464
01:51:42,551 --> 01:51:47,551
I was getting challenged and basically I
got the legislation has no difference 

2465
01:51:47,551 --> 01:51:49,870
between a bazooka and a in a pocket 
knife that the same thing.

2466
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:52,440
Ak Forty seven and it's the same thing 
in the.

2467
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,170
You kill somebody with it.
If.

2468
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,720
So it's the same thing.
It's the same thing.

2469
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,880
If I try to get through airport security
with a bazooka,

2470
01:51:57,881 --> 01:52:00,580
I'd be under the same legislation and 
under the same thing.

2471
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:03,310
And so I got off lightly instead of get 
used in jail.

2472
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,470
Um,
because obviously first offense,

2473
01:52:05,471 --> 01:52:08,020
no,
no prior record or that sort of stuff.

2474
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,960
I got a,
there's a fancy word for it.

2475
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:13,260
I want to say indentured servitude,
but that's not it.

2476
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,300
It's like a good behavior bond.
So I got four for the next year.

2477
01:52:16,301 --> 01:52:17,710
As long as you don't break any more 
laws,

2478
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:19,930
then that conviction will disappear 
basically.

2479
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:21,310
Wow.
But yeah,

2480
01:52:21,311 --> 01:52:26,311
I went to court,
charged with being a terrorist for 

2481
01:52:26,311 --> 01:52:26,311
bloody pocket knife and that's when I 
must have been after that.

2482
01:52:26,311 --> 01:52:30,931
I was trying to think.
I didn't really want to live in 

2483
01:52:30,931 --> 01:52:30,931
Australia anymore because it's just 
gotten a bit too crazy.

2484
01:52:30,931 --> 01:52:35,110
Do you think that's the same sort of a 
momentum that's behind,

2485
01:52:35,111 --> 01:52:40,111
like getting rid of the immigrants and 
shipping them off to new places and 

2486
01:52:40,111 --> 01:52:40,260
putting people in jail for reporting on 
it?

2487
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:45,300
Least have some thing,
Patriot Act where they bring in a law 

2488
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:45,890
that does all this sort of stuff and 
they don't debate.

2489
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:51,230
It just goes instantly through and no 
one even reads the law of what's going 

2490
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:55,211
through and we had this whole.
It was so staged if so easily you could 

2491
01:52:55,211 --> 01:52:59,471
see was staged where they had.
We've arrested 20 terrorists in Sydney 

2492
01:52:59,471 --> 01:53:03,880
now.
They actually had to let them all go 

2493
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:05,800
because they didn't have anything on 
anyone but they filmed it and it was on 

2494
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:08,390
national news of them writing all these 
places and then immediately brought in a

2495
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:10,520
week later,
new laws and that no one debated.

2496
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:13,300
No one even written brought him in and 
one of those laws were,

2497
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:18,380
yeah,
you take a pocket knife through airport 

2498
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,051
security.
You have to go to court to defend 

2499
01:53:20,051 --> 01:53:20,051
yourself.
That's such a stupid.

2500
01:53:20,051 --> 01:53:22,880
With law,
I mean the United States laws which are 

2501
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:25,641
pretty strict or nothing like that.
I went through security accidentally 

2502
01:53:25,641 --> 01:53:25,641
with a pocketknife they just took,
it

2503
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:26,950
was a,
everyone does this,

2504
01:53:26,951 --> 01:53:29,010
but I,
I just spend 3000,

2505
01:53:29,011 --> 01:53:34,011
$4,000,
million money and try and work this out 

2506
01:53:34,011 --> 01:53:35,950
that way and now to this day,
whenever I travel my bags,

2507
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:40,980
if I have a short short transit,
my bags went make it because they get 

2508
01:53:41,021 --> 01:53:43,120
searched every single a protocol on the 
list.

2509
01:53:44,010 --> 01:53:46,600
I just spent three weeks in Antarctica 
with no luggage.

2510
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:48,520
It never,
it never arrived.

2511
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:53,550
Oh Christ.
Because it went through extra security 

2512
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:56,491
in and then didn't arrive for a couple 
of days and I was already down in 

2513
01:53:56,491 --> 01:53:56,491
Antarctica

2514
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:59,830
just because of a pocket knife just 
because of a pocket knife.

2515
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:01,140
Yeah,
in America.

2516
01:54:01,141 --> 01:54:05,910
I went through it in Denver.
I had a backpack and the backpack in one

2517
01:54:05,911 --> 01:54:10,911
of the small pockets that are very small
knife in it and they sent me through 

2518
01:54:10,911 --> 01:54:14,991
secondary screening was I think you got 
a pocket knife in your backpack or 

2519
01:54:14,991 --> 01:54:16,170
sorry,
the guy took it and that was it.

2520
01:54:16,530 --> 01:54:17,550
Yeah,
take it easy.

2521
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:18,360
Okay,
bye.

2522
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:20,700
Done.
That's what it's always been locked,

2523
01:54:20,701 --> 01:54:22,860
but they changed the law.
That's so crazy.

2524
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:24,670
That doesn't make any sense at all.
It's just,

2525
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:27,280
it's a waste of my money.
It's a waste of the court's money.

2526
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:32,600
What do you think they're doing it to 
try to make more money by making more 

2527
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:32,600
court cases?
Well,

2528
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,420
I had to pay the court costs.

2529
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:36,020
I mean obviously,
but I,

2530
01:54:36,510 --> 01:54:39,240
I just think it's Laura upon laws in 
Australia,

2531
01:54:39,241 --> 01:54:42,360
we are shocking at laws upon laws and 
laws.

2532
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:49,260
No one speeds in Australia.
I drove down from San Francisco 

2533
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:52,231
yesterday and it was ludicrous how fast 
people would drive the speed limit 

2534
01:54:52,231 --> 01:54:56,600
because the speed that they were driving
like 40 k's over the speed limit is 

2535
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:57,570
something that in Australia is you lose 
your license instantly.

2536
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,070
You don't have a license for the next 
year,

2537
01:54:59,150 --> 01:54:59,990
so really?
Yeah.

2538
01:54:59,991 --> 01:55:03,720
So no one's speeds like that for a year.
Oh God.

2539
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:09,140
So yeah.
But that's because we just have so many 

2540
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:11,991
laws.
We just have so many different laws in 

2541
01:55:11,991 --> 01:55:11,991
that respect.

2542
01:55:11,991 --> 01:55:16,570
That's disturbing.
But that's not what I wanted to talk to 

2543
01:55:16,570 --> 01:55:16,570
you about.
Men bumming me out about Australia.

2544
01:55:16,570 --> 01:55:17,750
I was thinking about moving to 
Australia.

2545
01:55:17,751 --> 01:55:18,830
I'm like,
maybe that's the spot.

2546
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:22,370
I've heard that a lot from the American 
since trump is doing his thing.

2547
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,750
No,
it's not because of that.

2548
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:27,350
I just think I just like it.
I mean I wouldn't really move there,

2549
01:55:27,351 --> 01:55:32,351
but like if the shit hit the fan,
someone blew up Manhattan or something 

2550
01:55:32,351 --> 01:55:32,351
like that.
I'm like,

2551
01:55:32,351 --> 01:55:33,290
Ooh,
time of jolt or bolt,

2552
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:34,520
whatever,
whatever it is.

2553
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:38,150
That's an interesting one.
Where I was for nine slash 11.

2554
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:42,950
Where were you?
I was in up in the very northern reaches

2555
01:55:42,951 --> 01:55:44,250
of Australia in the middle of nowhere.

2556
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:48,720
I'm so far away that you couldn't get 
any signal for anything,

2557
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:52,680
but one of the people on board had a 
shortwave radio,

2558
01:55:52,681 --> 01:55:57,681
like a ham radio and so I learned of 
nine slash 11 via radio and it was like 

2559
01:55:57,681 --> 01:56:02,240
war of the worlds man.
It sounded like the whole world was 

2560
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:05,510
going to shine and.
But we were on a boat in the middle of 

2561
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:05,510
nowhere and we did kind of just all 
looked at each other and go,

2562
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:08,130
well we got two or three months supply 
of food here.

2563
01:56:08,131 --> 01:56:11,400
We can stretch that out with fishing and
we're in the middle of nowhere.

2564
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:13,860
We can go sit up that creek over there 
and yeah,

2565
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:18,890
we were kind of pretty bugged out.
It wasn't until about two months later 

2566
01:56:18,890 --> 01:56:18,990
they actually got back and saw the 
images of what happened.

2567
01:56:19,530 --> 01:56:24,530
But it sounds like war of the worlds 
when you listened to that sort of event 

2568
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:25,500
over a radio,
it was scary.

2569
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:28,140
That's a weird way to get information 
to.

2570
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:30,690
So,
so like retro,

2571
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:36,000
you know,
to get information about some sort of a 

2572
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,710
gigantic catastrophe or calamity 
horrendous event.

2573
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:45,000
Like nine slash 11 to get an over radio,
like just,

2574
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:50,120
it sounded like world war three.
That's what it sounded like from the 

2575
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:50,450
radio at least.
Yeah.

2576
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:55,460
It's like,
well it looked like world war three on 

2577
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:55,460
tv that day too though,
in all fairness.

2578
01:56:55,460 --> 01:57:00,050
I remember watching on TV and went with 
a bunch of my friends because there was 

2579
01:57:00,050 --> 01:57:02,330
no flights.
I had some gigs planned.

2580
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:07,340
I couldn't go.
So actually supposed to be in Manhattan 

2581
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:07,340
that week.
Lucky.

2582
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:07,950
Yeah.
Um,

2583
01:57:07,951 --> 01:57:12,300
I was supposed to fly to Manhattan the 
week after September 11 that all flights

2584
01:57:12,301 --> 01:57:16,290
were canceled and I remember hanging out
with some friends in La and everyone was

2585
01:57:16,291 --> 01:57:21,291
bugging out like why is going to happen?
And then we were aware because of the 

2586
01:57:21,291 --> 01:57:23,550
news that there was no flights and it 
was a beautiful,

2587
01:57:23,551 --> 01:57:24,270
clear skies.

2588
01:57:24,290 --> 01:57:26,100
It was strange,
strange.

2589
01:57:26,101 --> 01:57:27,750
Hey,
look up like there's no,

2590
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:29,670
no airplanes.
Yeah,

2591
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,260
just nothing.
You don't hear him.

2592
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:32,820
You look up,
you don't see any.

2593
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:36,300
I think it was some of the clear skies 
ever recorded over the USA.

2594
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:37,380
Everything.
Yeah.

2595
01:57:37,381 --> 01:57:38,160
Well,
not only that,

2596
01:57:38,161 --> 01:57:43,161
the temperature lowered changed the 
temperature of the earth or maybe 

2597
01:57:43,161 --> 01:57:45,540
raised,
I forget one of the water vapor.

2598
01:57:45,541 --> 01:57:46,740
It would've lowered.
Yeah,

2599
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:48,600
it would've got a little bit cool.
Is that what it is?

2600
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:53,260
Because things happened and we'll either
raised or lowered depending upon the.

2601
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:57,780
There was also the water vapor could 
protect the atmosphere and a lot because

2602
01:57:57,781 --> 01:57:59,030
it's like cloud cover,
you know,

2603
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,740
when you get contrary contracts on which
one it was,

2604
01:58:01,741 --> 01:58:06,741
but it was like a noticeable amount that
it changed a CEO to an airplane's 

2605
01:58:06,741 --> 01:58:07,630
pumping out.
It's nothing too serious.

2606
01:58:07,631 --> 01:58:11,400
This is one of the most efficient forms 
of transport you can have put person,

2607
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:15,370
but where it's injecting that CEO too 
and that water vapor up in that,

2608
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:17,500
you know,
in the high atmosphere it's,

2609
01:58:17,630 --> 01:58:18,900
it's doing some damage.

2610
01:58:18,930 --> 01:58:21,350
It is not as much as I think we give it 
credit for.

2611
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:25,940
Well the other thing is people that live
near airports suffer some sick.

2612
01:58:25,950 --> 01:58:27,300
What does that.
Jamie would just put up.

2613
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:29,090
It got hotter actually.
Yeah.

2614
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:33,660
Did two degrees hotter.
Yeah.

2615
01:58:33,661 --> 01:58:36,240
That's what I was thinking because I 
think is the lack of.

2616
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:41,940
Because those trails that are created,
the artificial clouds that are by jet 

2617
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:44,380
engines naturally stirring up the 
humidity.

2618
01:58:44,870 --> 01:58:47,800
Maybe they're reflecting back solar 
radiation.

2619
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:51,040
Well that's where all the chem trail 
craziness comes from.

2620
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:56,130
The geoengineering people,
they believe that that is actually done 

2621
01:58:56,130 --> 01:58:57,010
on purpose and then what we're doing is 
we're,

2622
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,460
we're making artificial clouds try to 
control the environment.

2623
01:59:00,461 --> 01:59:01,720
Well,
it's not true.

2624
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:05,230
I mean we know why those things are 
made.

2625
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:10,260
They're made.
It's a natural formation that happens 

2626
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:10,260
when you have a jet engine passes 
through condensation.

2627
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:11,930
It creates contract is not chem trails.

2628
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:14,100
I always try and point that one out.
It's a,

2629
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:19,400
there's a guy named Mick West who runs 
this website called Metta bunk and just 

2630
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:24,160
sort of debunks a lot of like really 
commonly held ideas that conspiracy 

2631
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:28,261
theories tend to grab onto,
but he calls it the training wheels of 

2632
01:59:28,261 --> 01:59:28,930
conspiracy theories because it's like in
the sky above your head.

2633
01:59:28,931 --> 01:59:30,370
Like what is that?
And they're like,

2634
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:31,940
we've got to get to the bottom of this,
you know,

2635
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:37,020
and that's sort of where instead of like
researching what actually happens with 

2636
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:40,180
jet engines and condensation and it on,
people say,

2637
01:59:40,181 --> 01:59:45,181
well,
how come one day there'll be no 

2638
01:59:45,181 --> 01:59:45,181
cantrell's and another dude will be a 
lot.

2639
01:59:45,181 --> 01:59:49,411
Well,
how come one day it rains and the other 

2640
01:59:49,411 --> 01:59:49,411
day it doesn't really fit you really 
well.

2641
01:59:49,411 --> 01:59:50,890
It's condensation and it's how the 
amount of moisture in the atmosphere.

2642
01:59:50,891 --> 01:59:53,350
It's whatever.
This is a different subject.

2643
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:55,870
Um,
I wanted to talk to you about some other

2644
01:59:55,871 --> 01:59:57,200
shit that you had on your,
um,

2645
01:59:57,430 --> 02:00:02,430
you had a neurological decompression 
illness from you.

2646
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:05,170
You're trying to give a happy here,
but this is actually getting sad.

2647
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:06,880
Well this is scary.
Yeah,

2648
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,380
it's,
it's a story.

2649
02:00:08,381 --> 02:00:09,610
I was hoping you're going to do another 
one.

2650
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:11,320
Oh really?
And it's certainly we can do that.

2651
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,960
We don't have to.
I want to tell you it's just,

2652
02:00:13,961 --> 02:00:16,810
it's a depressing,
depressing what happened.

2653
02:00:17,290 --> 02:00:21,460
So I'm scuba diving,
scuba diving since I was 12 years old,

2654
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:25,160
a $13,000.
I'm asking a lot of time underwater.

2655
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:26,740
Whoa.
And uh,

2656
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:28,820
so one light sites inevitable.
I don't know.

2657
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:32,260
But uh,
so I was diving nothing too serious,

2658
02:00:32,261 --> 02:00:33,580
you know,
a shallow dive.

2659
02:00:33,610 --> 02:00:35,560
It was a bit of a car and I was turning 
into a bit of a current,

2660
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:38,620
maybe slightly dehydrated,
who knows?

2661
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:39,880
Um,
but yeah,

2662
02:00:40,090 --> 02:00:45,090
I got messed up now.
I've been diving for nine days prior to 

2663
02:00:45,090 --> 02:00:45,820
that full dives a day,
so I'd had some residual nitrogen.

2664
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:48,910
I've got bubbles in my blood basically,
and then doing this one,

2665
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:51,700
I guess a little bit of exertion 
underwater and stuff like that.

2666
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:53,020
Yeah,
I got messed up.

2667
02:00:53,021 --> 02:00:57,640
So when I came out of the water you have
a bad headache and stuff like that.

2668
02:00:57,670 --> 02:01:02,670
And then um,
eventually I was looking down at my 

2669
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:06,250
hands and my hands had gone into Phis 
and I couldn't open my hands anymore.

2670
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:09,490
And that to me was the big thing 
straight away I was like,

2671
02:01:09,491 --> 02:01:14,491
Whoa,
I've never had that before where I 

2672
02:01:14,491 --> 02:01:14,491
didn't have control of my buddy,
you know.

2673
02:01:14,491 --> 02:01:19,180
And so my hands were world class,
so I ran upstairs to my bunk,

2674
02:01:19,210 --> 02:01:20,610
told the first night,
you know,

2675
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:23,440
get the oxygen and stuff like that.
I've got something's going wrong here.

2676
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:28,920
And then when I laid down in my bunk,
I just severe pain going over the whole 

2677
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:32,410
entire body.
Arms enhance both totally paralyzed.

2678
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:35,890
Couldn't move them enormous,
enormous amount of pain.

2679
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:40,990
A box jellyfish pain or no,
no,

2680
02:01:41,351 --> 02:01:42,200
no.
Nothing near that.

2681
02:01:42,201 --> 02:01:43,110
I think more discussion

2682
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:44,650
paying because you just don't know 
what's going on,

2683
02:01:44,710 --> 02:01:45,850
you know,
you just don't know.

2684
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:49,180
Your whole body is just suddenly doing 
stuff that it's never done before.

2685
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:54,540
Um,
and so when an oxygen and ended up 

2686
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:54,990
passing out actually after a few,
maybe half an hour.

2687
02:01:54,991 --> 02:01:59,991
So I ended up passing out and then woke 
up and I was just really dopey and 

2688
02:01:59,991 --> 02:02:02,710
doughy and stuff.
And long story short,

2689
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:07,870
um,
for various reasons I didn't actually 

2690
02:02:07,870 --> 02:02:09,130
get treatment for about six days.
It was very remote area in this.

2691
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:14,170
There's all this stuff there and uh,
and then I spent nine days in a chamber 

2692
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:20,370
decompression chamber basically to try 
and try and repair what had gone wrong 

2693
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:26,460
because I had nerve damage in the hands 
and feet,

2694
02:02:27,610 --> 02:02:32,610
spine and brain.
So I had quite a significant brand 

2695
02:02:32,610 --> 02:02:33,630
damage.
Um,

2696
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:38,760
the spine damage,
the spine causes a lot of fatigue and 

2697
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:41,551
things like that.
And then the hands and feet just pain 

2698
02:02:41,551 --> 02:02:41,551
basically.
Um,

2699
02:02:41,551 --> 02:02:42,280
yeah,
that happened in 2012.

2700
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:44,860
I got messed up,
messed up.

2701
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:47,470
So brain damage,
like what kind of brain damage?

2702
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:51,490
A literally brain damage.
So what's going on in my body is lots of

2703
02:02:51,491 --> 02:02:54,550
little tiny bubbles basically are all 
nerves,

2704
02:02:54,551 --> 02:02:57,210
bloodstream everywhere,
and they cause inflammation and they,

2705
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,680
they kill stuff.
I had a lot of muscle atrophy,

2706
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:04,700
you know,
I had a lot of muscles just die on me 

2707
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:06,740
cause they,
their blood supply had been blocked by 

2708
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:08,971
these little bubbles going around.
Do you see like a difference in your 

2709
02:03:08,971 --> 02:03:10,300
body to turn black and blue or does it 
shrink?

2710
02:03:10,330 --> 02:03:11,590
Like what you,
you lose your,

2711
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:14,980
all your muscle mass,
just shrivels you lose your muscle mass.

2712
02:03:14,981 --> 02:03:19,981
It changed the appearance of the skin.
Like does it seem like yellowing where 

2713
02:03:19,981 --> 02:03:22,090
it's rotting underneath or anything?
Nothing like that.

2714
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:24,310
Um,
I had to learn how to walk again.

2715
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:27,610
I could barely walk and I had to learn.

2716
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:30,310
Vocabulary was a hard one.
I said we're really good vocabulary now.

2717
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:32,490
Not so much anymore.
I,

2718
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:35,800
I killed a lot of brain cells.
Brain cells,

2719
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:41,040
you feel stupid.
Or I had,

2720
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:47,220
I tested my Iq beforehand and I was 
about 150,

2721
02:03:47,221 --> 02:03:52,221
160 marketing and now I'm about 120.
So you're still a fucking genius.

2722
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:56,080
I wouldn't go that far,
but some Iq points.

2723
02:03:56,081 --> 02:03:56,690
That's.
Well,

2724
02:03:56,710 --> 02:04:01,710
you used to be a genius for sure.
I'm a photographic memory.

2725
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:04,090
I won 51.
Sixty is definitely a genius.

2726
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:09,240
I thought too much.
Basically it's better for you to feel a 

2727
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:09,240
little stupid.
Well,

2728
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:10,000
I enjoy bad movies now.
There you go.

2729
02:04:10,030 --> 02:04:11,520
Yeah,
because Adam Sandler movies,

2730
02:04:11,521 --> 02:04:16,521
so like reese witherspoon movie,
any movie this predictable where before 

2731
02:04:16,521 --> 02:04:19,771
I'd be like,
I know it was legally blonde to watch 

2732
02:04:19,771 --> 02:04:19,771
that over and over again.
Any of these movies and that's it.

2733
02:04:19,771 --> 02:04:20,830
But I appreciate bad movies.

2734
02:04:20,830 --> 02:04:25,830
There's always a.
there's always a positive side to 

2735
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:25,830
everything.
So do you really?

2736
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:29,240
It's so it actually made you 
significantly less intelligent and you 

2737
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:30,880
can consume pop culture now.
Yeah.

2738
02:04:30,970 --> 02:04:35,970
Basically.
Do you enjoy reality shows now that 

2739
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:40,170
Beverly Hills housewife?
My TV at home as an isn't actually 

2740
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:40,170
connected to an area little.
Oh,

2741
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:43,200
you're one of those guys.
I don't like advertising.

2742
02:04:43,201 --> 02:04:48,201
I think advertising is evil.
So you use like Netflix or something 

2743
02:04:48,201 --> 02:04:48,201
like that?
Well that's smart.

2744
02:04:48,201 --> 02:04:48,750
That's the future anyway,
right?

2745
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:51,900
You're ahead of the ball.
Anything goods on itunes already,

2746
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:55,080
you know,
most of the good shows in a walking dead

2747
02:04:55,081 --> 02:04:56,430
or game of thrones or anything like 
that.

2748
02:04:56,431 --> 02:04:58,770
You could always find them,
well I want to choose my own schedule as

2749
02:04:58,771 --> 02:05:00,090
well.
I don't want to be,

2750
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:05,120
oh,
Wednesday night and I have to stay in 

2751
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:05,120
because I want to watch that one show.

2752
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:06,270
Like my kids don't know what commercials
are really.

2753
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:09,270
They don't understand it and most of the
time we watch shows with them.

2754
02:05:09,271 --> 02:05:12,150
We watched on Dvr and you could fast 
forward through commercials,

2755
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:17,660
but occasionally we'll watch like one of
their favorite shows and it'll come on 

2756
02:05:17,660 --> 02:05:22,041
and they'll watch it while it's on and 
then the show will be on and then it'll 

2757
02:05:22,041 --> 02:05:24,050
go to commercial and they reach for the 
remote and it's like,

2758
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:29,100
don't.
It's not letting them fast forward and 

2759
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:29,520
like what is going on here?
Like why do we have to watch this?

2760
02:05:29,521 --> 02:05:30,690
I'm like,
well that's a commercial.

2761
02:05:30,691 --> 02:05:32,300
That's it.
That's how it normally is.

2762
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:37,350
Welcome to what we had to deal with,
but the look on their little faces when 

2763
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:38,700
you see a little look on like a five or 
six year old's face,

2764
02:05:38,701 --> 02:05:41,050
we were like,
what the fuck you I have to.

2765
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:46,050
I have to watch this stupid thing.
And they're watching these commercials 

2766
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:46,050
like,
like puzzled,

2767
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:50,751
like who?
Like even a child realizes this is a 

2768
02:05:50,751 --> 02:05:51,300
dumb way to advertise.
Advertise things.

2769
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:51,940
Yeah.
It's,

2770
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:57,220
it's actually,
I think it makes you not want to 

2771
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,500
purchase those things.
They've interrupted your program,

2772
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:04,750
but that's because you're intelligent.
I would say it does work for a vast 

2773
02:06:05,191 --> 02:06:07,510
majority of people who don't,
you know,

2774
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:09,540
it's just subliminal than not even 
thinking about it,

2775
02:06:09,541 --> 02:06:10,470
but it just goes in,
Hey,

2776
02:06:10,471 --> 02:06:15,471
I want to cook.
Don't you think it works less and less 

2777
02:06:15,471 --> 02:06:17,421
though.
Possibly as we get disassociated with 

2778
02:06:17,421 --> 02:06:21,921
it,
with Netflix and stuff like that as we 

2779
02:06:21,921 --> 02:06:21,921
move away from it.
But I think,

2780
02:06:21,921 --> 02:06:26,030
I think advertising is evil.
Haven't seen the south park related 

2781
02:06:26,030 --> 02:06:26,030
sandbox.
I go onto it quite well,

2782
02:06:26,030 --> 02:06:27,510
but advertising,
yeah,

2783
02:06:27,511 --> 02:06:30,240
I see why it's there,
but yeah,

2784
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:36,080
it really bugs me and it bugs me 
probably also because in Australia we 

2785
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:36,080
have such terrible ads.

2786
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:40,500
We had Chris Bell and Mark Bell from the
documentary,

2787
02:06:40,501 --> 02:06:41,130
bigger,
stronger,

2788
02:06:41,131 --> 02:06:46,131
faster and the new one,
prescription thugs where they go over 

2789
02:06:46,131 --> 02:06:49,911
the effect of the prescription drug 
industry and what massive influence it 

2790
02:06:49,911 --> 02:06:54,741
has on people and the amount of people 
that are hooked on pain pills and 

2791
02:06:54,741 --> 02:06:54,741
whatnot.
It was bands in Australia by the way.

2792
02:06:54,741 --> 02:06:58,790
They should be and they were talking in 
the documentary about during the Reagan 

2793
02:06:58,790 --> 02:07:02,961
administration when they became legal 
and they started advertising for all 

2794
02:07:02,961 --> 02:07:06,711
these drugs and how how much different 
the landscape changed when all of a 

2795
02:07:06,711 --> 02:07:10,950
sudden there was an ad then showed you 
all these things that may be you have an

2796
02:07:10,951 --> 02:07:14,580
issue and maybe you should talk to your 
doctor about this stuff,

2797
02:07:14,581 --> 02:07:16,500
and then you know the sales go through 
the roof.

2798
02:07:16,501 --> 02:07:18,630
They get addicted to that money that 
comes from no sales.

2799
02:07:19,110 --> 02:07:24,110
It's a really disturbing aspect of our 
society that you can advertise for drugs

2800
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:26,870
like prescription.
How many pharmaceuticals,

2801
02:07:26,871 --> 02:07:31,260
how many different drugs and American an
average American is on at any one point?

2802
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:33,840
When I was in the dive industry as a 
supervisor,

2803
02:07:33,841 --> 02:07:36,280
I would get lists of everyone on board

2804
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:41,280
and their medical conditions and what 
drugs that are currently taking and 

2805
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:41,280
Australian.
It's just like,

2806
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:41,280
oh,
Yep,

2807
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:41,790
yep.
Nothing,

2808
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:45,850
nothing bump and American that have five
or six things listed there,

2809
02:07:45,851 --> 02:07:50,851
and then I would have to actually go do 
the research on each drug and see if 

2810
02:07:50,851 --> 02:07:51,250
they conflicted with diving and stuff 
like that.

2811
02:07:51,490 --> 02:07:53,290
It was a lot of work and you kind of 
like,

2812
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:58,470
oh,
this is an upper and this is a downer 

2813
02:07:58,470 --> 02:08:00,031
and this is a kind of level or well,
people of antidepressants and they have 

2814
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:05,020
an extra abilify that they add to an 
antidepressant.

2815
02:08:05,021 --> 02:08:06,760
If that antidepressant isn't doing the 
job,

2816
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:12,360
but it could cause society a society to 
collapse and your asshole explodes and 

2817
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:16,420
you bleed out and some side effects may 
have suicidal thoughts.

2818
02:08:16,710 --> 02:08:20,170
It's apparently like there's a lot 
attached to it,

2819
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:24,850
like the fine print at the end when they
scroll through it and may cause Mama,

2820
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:30,060
it's like this huge list of 
possibilities that could go horribly 

2821
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:33,001
wrong,
but some people they just always think 

2822
02:08:33,001 --> 02:08:35,851
that a pill is the answer and I think 
that's also part of the programming 

2823
02:08:35,851 --> 02:08:37,090
that's sort of been in diamond.

2824
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:42,270
I'm in a really tough spot this point in
the last few years basically because 

2825
02:08:42,270 --> 02:08:43,090
I've always believed,
don't take a pill for the rest of you,

2826
02:08:43,091 --> 02:08:44,620
like take.
You've got a headache,

2827
02:08:44,650 --> 02:08:49,650
you take a headache pill route,
but you don't take a pill every single 

2828
02:08:49,650 --> 02:08:49,650
day of your life.
There's no point for that.

2829
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:52,940
Or you have something like diabetes or 
something right to shop.

2830
02:08:53,140 --> 02:08:56,050
There's always some exceptions there,
but lo and behold,

2831
02:08:56,051 --> 02:09:01,051
most people can actually with diabetes 
even changed their diet and sort of go 

2832
02:09:01,051 --> 02:09:04,441
that way.
There are ways to do without taking a 

2833
02:09:04,441 --> 02:09:05,110
pill every day,
but now I'm under this thing where since

2834
02:09:05,111 --> 02:09:06,700
that accident with decompression 
sickness,

2835
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:11,680
I have pain constantly in pain 
constantly.

2836
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:13,900
What you're hiding it very well.
Well,

2837
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:15,850
what do you do with your life?
You just cry.

2838
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:18,040
Go over there and cry.
I'll hide in the corner.

2839
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:20,320
But what are you gonna do?

2840
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:22,180
Like what kind of pain is it like you're
in right now?

2841
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:27,750
Hands and feet.
Basically the hands and feet are 

2842
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:28,390
throbbing or aching.
Stabbing pain feels like someone's got a

2843
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:33,391
need right now and have a stabbing pain 
in your hands and feet and you just 

2844
02:09:33,391 --> 02:09:33,391
become accustomed to.
Yeah.

2845
02:09:33,391 --> 02:09:34,000
Wow.
Yeah.

2846
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:39,060
It's all the nerve damage as you looked 
into hypobaric hyperbaric chambers or 

2847
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:43,060
nine days straight after it happened to 
barrick chambers.

2848
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:46,190
So I did nine days in hyperbaric 
chambers.

2849
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:48,890
Looked into continue therapy with that.
Um,

2850
02:09:48,910 --> 02:09:51,280
it's not something that'll.
Let me tell you.

2851
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,230
I would have to go pay for it myself.
Yes.

2852
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:57,510
I'd have to pay thousands of dollars to 
go get oxygen therapy for like,

2853
02:09:57,730 --> 02:09:59,230
football is football.
Let's go do it.

2854
02:09:59,231 --> 02:10:04,231
So they heal quicker.
If you actually talked to a doctor that 

2855
02:10:04,231 --> 02:10:07,401
would say it probably wouldn't do much 
because you do it after the event and 

2856
02:10:07,401 --> 02:10:07,401
that.

2857
02:10:07,401 --> 02:10:08,770
But now we're talking four years later 
and they're like,

2858
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,210
eh,
probably wouldn't do much.

2859
02:10:10,211 --> 02:10:15,211
But there's not a lot of.
The problem with decompression sickness 

2860
02:10:15,211 --> 02:10:15,340
is there's not a lot of evidence.
There's not a lot of research.

2861
02:10:15,341 --> 02:10:19,000
There is a holy per research,
but it's classified by the US marines,

2862
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:24,990
US Navy,
most of the evidence and most of the 

2863
02:10:24,990 --> 02:10:24,990
stuff out there,
it's very,

2864
02:10:24,990 --> 02:10:27,070
there's not a lot of data.
And so I remember going to these doctors

2865
02:10:27,071 --> 02:10:29,020
and they're like,
we don't really know.

2866
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:31,120
How do you go?
There's no set plan.

2867
02:10:31,150 --> 02:10:32,530
Oh,
you get decompression sickness.

2868
02:10:32,531 --> 02:10:34,160
Where do we go from here to,
to fix it?

2869
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:35,720
There isn't that kind of,
oh,

2870
02:10:35,721 --> 02:10:37,130
we'll try this,
we'll try this drug,

2871
02:10:37,131 --> 02:10:42,131
we'll try this,
we'll try this drug and we'll just keep 

2872
02:10:42,131 --> 02:10:42,131
trying different drugs and see what 
happens basically.

2873
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,750
Whoa.
I've tried a lot of drugs in the last 40

2874
02:10:44,751 --> 02:10:45,020
years.

2875
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:49,290
What has offered you the most relief?
Um,

2876
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:53,530
I'll get in trouble for saying it.
But a acupuncture was actually with it.

2877
02:10:53,550 --> 02:10:56,340
You get in trouble for saying that.
The anti acupuncture lobby,

2878
02:10:57,980 --> 02:11:01,220
basically I had to find some guy who,
who kind of did it.

2879
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:04,610
He was a doctor and then he did 
acupuncture as we call it,

2880
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:07,190
bulk billing is part of the government 
sort of thing so I could get it.

2881
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:12,620
Um,
so I did that and that reduced my pain 

2882
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:13,010
by about half a straight afterwards.
Yeah,

2883
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:16,430
huge thing.
The other drugs I tried.

2884
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:17,990
Oh God,
um,

2885
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:20,570
I mean the names we'll kind of mix over 
here.

2886
02:11:20,571 --> 02:11:23,410
So think the first thing they did is 
they check you on any presence,

2887
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:25,730
Cymbalta,
that sort of stuff.

2888
02:11:26,190 --> 02:11:27,380
Um,
because they're like,

2889
02:11:27,381 --> 02:11:32,381
well,
he's just having trouble adjusting to 

2890
02:11:32,381 --> 02:11:32,381
the fact that he's in pain all the time,
so let's give me an antidepressant.

2891
02:11:32,381 --> 02:11:34,850
So he's happy,
which it does take the edge off,

2892
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:38,780
but it's a kind of half against it.
But B,

2893
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:41,120
it just,
you just had to keep upping the dose,

2894
02:11:41,121 --> 02:11:46,121
you know,
you started from 10 milligrams and then 

2895
02:11:46,121 --> 02:11:46,121
in a month's time it wouldn't do 
anything anymore.

2896
02:11:46,121 --> 02:11:49,391
You Go to 20 and you just keep upping 
the dose and so you just become 

2897
02:11:49,391 --> 02:11:51,770
accustomed to the dosage because it's 
not taking the pain away.

2898
02:11:51,771 --> 02:11:53,140
It's just taking the edge off,
you know,

2899
02:11:53,150 --> 02:11:54,350
making it,
not think about it.

2900
02:11:54,351 --> 02:11:54,680
So much

2901
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,790
one of the reasons why a friend of mine 
got off of them,

2902
02:11:56,791 --> 02:11:58,060
he said,
you,

2903
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:03,080
he realized like you're going to get 
adapted to whatever dose they give you 

2904
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:03,080
and then they're going to come up with 
some.

2905
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:08,360
Well,
this isn't working anymore because your 

2906
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:08,360
body's accustomed to it.
You built up a tolerance.

2907
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:10,180
So we're gonna try a new SSRI on you.
Yeah,

2908
02:12:10,181 --> 02:12:10,240
yeah.

2909
02:12:10,930 --> 02:12:13,570
I eventually got off the Cymbalta 
because it was just,

2910
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:17,200
I was getting to basically the 
depressive dosage.

2911
02:12:17,201 --> 02:12:20,110
I was getting up to 60 milligrams or 
something and so I was like,

2912
02:12:20,111 --> 02:12:21,670
well,
I don't want to keep going with this.

2913
02:12:21,730 --> 02:12:25,750
And quite frankly it's not doing much.
So I got off that and they put me on one

2914
02:12:25,751 --> 02:12:28,240
court Lyrica,
which has an epileptic drug.

2915
02:12:28,330 --> 02:12:29,350
Jesus,
um,

2916
02:12:29,590 --> 02:12:33,310
I've tried a lot of drugs and air that 
just mess with me,

2917
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:38,340
mess with my head.
I had to quit it because I was going to 

2918
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:38,340
lose my job because I just didn't turn 
up to work anymore.

2919
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:42,751
I would sleep through my alarms and wake
up four or five hours later and dislike 

2920
02:12:42,751 --> 02:12:44,890
it just missed with me and I was captain
of the ship at the time.

2921
02:12:44,891 --> 02:12:46,630
So I'm like,
I can't be driving this ship.

2922
02:12:46,631 --> 02:12:51,631
I can't be in charge of all these people
and being messed up on some epileptic 

2923
02:12:51,791 --> 02:12:52,000
drugs.

2924
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:57,000
So I stopped doing that one.
Then what I try after that,

2925
02:12:58,070 --> 02:12:58,870
uh,
in depth,

2926
02:12:59,230 --> 02:13:00,890
which is a,
it's a,

2927
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:04,840
any depressant from the sixties I 
believe it's not used at all anymore,

2928
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:07,450
but there's no evidence.
There's like,

2929
02:13:07,510 --> 02:13:12,510
oh,
we have like 10 drugs here that sends 

2930
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:14,421
some experiments experimenting on you.
And so I've been on that one for a 

2931
02:13:14,421 --> 02:13:14,421
while.
The same thing I just kept getting,

2932
02:13:14,490 --> 02:13:17,060
well the first time I took it I actually
slept for about 20 hours straight.

2933
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:22,090
It just messed me up.
So I've been kind of very low doses of 

2934
02:13:22,090 --> 02:13:25,720
it and once again it just stopped.
Not really doing much for the pain.

2935
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:30,990
And then I said,
I've just spent three weeks in the 

2936
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:30,990
Antarctic with no bags,
which means no medication either.

2937
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:32,280
So actually spent three weeks without 
it.

2938
02:13:32,281 --> 02:13:35,490
And I noticed straight away I had more 
energy during the day.

2939
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:37,950
It actually caused me to be fatigued for
the morning,

2940
02:13:38,170 --> 02:13:39,740
um,
and I don't have that anymore.

2941
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:44,130
And the level of pain tolerance that it 
was giving me was just insignificant.

2942
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:49,670
So now I'm just back to popping a pill 
when it gets too much at night.

2943
02:13:51,050 --> 02:13:52,200
Uh,
at the moment,

2944
02:13:52,201 --> 02:13:55,010
coating pan,
we call it Panadeine Forte,

2945
02:13:55,030 --> 02:13:59,700
which is a paracetamal and a small dose 
according to just try to get some sleep.

2946
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:01,330
Yeah,
just to the insomnia.

2947
02:14:01,331 --> 02:14:04,530
You get insomnia from all the pain.
So that's what I try and do.

2948
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:06,240
Um,
yeah,

2949
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:11,600
they,
the next one they wanted me to try with 

2950
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:11,600
methadone.
I know that one yet.

2951
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:13,980
Jesus Christ,
that's what they do to get people off of

2952
02:14:13,981 --> 02:14:16,590
heroin.
That's just a Guinea pig.

2953
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:18,420
They just keep experimenting with me.
Fuck man.

2954
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,040
That's,
that seems so crazy.

2955
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:21,720
Well,
hopefully people will listen to this,

2956
02:14:21,721 --> 02:14:23,590
that have some information though.

2957
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:27,570
I'm open to ideas.
I hope they do reach out to you.

2958
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:32,930
Um,
you had pirates in here as a subject to 

2959
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:32,930
bring up.
Did you have any experience with pirate?

2960
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:35,440
I'm know Tom Hanks movie.
No,

2961
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:37,520
no,
I just used to do a talk on it.

2962
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:39,420
We did a through,
you know,

2963
02:14:39,450 --> 02:14:42,300
sort of not past Somalia but Tanzania,
Maldives,

2964
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:47,600
Seychelles around that whole area.
So a lot of people want to talk about 

2965
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:50,511
policy.
So I have a little presentation that I 

2966
02:14:50,511 --> 02:14:52,800
kind of did on piracy in there,
but what I quite liked to show people is

2967
02:14:52,801 --> 02:14:55,870
actually I liked bringing new technology
into the equation.

2968
02:14:55,871 --> 02:14:58,650
So there's a website called live piracy 
map,

2969
02:14:58,651 --> 02:15:03,651
and you can actually see a map of,
of the world and all the current pirate 

2970
02:15:04,171 --> 02:15:06,480
attacks around the world.
It's pretty cool.

2971
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:11,660
Was that something to be concerned with 
when you're driving around that big 

2972
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:11,660
hundred million dollar beautiful boat?

2973
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:12,780
No,
not at all.

2974
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,640
No.
Do you guys have security with you?

2975
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:15,630
No,
not at all.

2976
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:18,630
We fucked up saying that.
She'd say,

2977
02:15:18,631 --> 02:15:20,700
yeah,
armed to the teeth superhero.

2978
02:15:20,730 --> 02:15:23,760
If I told you I'd have to kill.
You know what?

2979
02:15:25,110 --> 02:15:28,170
Pirates attack a cargo ship.
Something with very little crew,

2980
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:29,190
10 cruise,
something like that.

2981
02:15:29,191 --> 02:15:32,190
They attack something that's a big prize
with very little people protecting it.

2982
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:37,820
They don't.
Occasionally they'll go for yachts a 

2983
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:40,110
little time and yachts that cruise 
ships,

2984
02:15:40,111 --> 02:15:45,111
I think the last sort of cruise ship or 
big ship that they tried to attack as 

2985
02:15:45,111 --> 02:15:49,071
they came up alongside it,
all guests on board grabbed all the 

2986
02:15:49,071 --> 02:15:52,701
outdoor furniture or the sun lounges and
stuff like that and threw it at the 

2987
02:15:52,701 --> 02:15:53,130
people coming up in the little boats and
killed some of them.

2988
02:15:53,420 --> 02:15:54,600
Um,
with furniture.

2989
02:15:54,990 --> 02:15:59,990
The furniture there with the pirates 
were killed by falling furniture from 

2990
02:15:59,990 --> 02:15:59,990
the roof.

2991
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:01,290
Um,
so they just don't do it.

2992
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:06,300
There's how you jump on board a ship 
like a that I'm on and you have 100 

2993
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:08,220
guests and you have 80 credits,
180 people.

2994
02:16:08,221 --> 02:16:09,980
You're going to try and manage,
um,

2995
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:11,370
you know,
kind of get away with it.

2996
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:13,490
Like there's the pirate map or the.
Yeah.

2997
02:16:13,630 --> 02:16:16,170
So that's the,
the piracy map.

2998
02:16:16,171 --> 02:16:17,610
So you can click on each one of those 
little,

2999
02:16:17,611 --> 02:16:22,611
um,
little tags and it will tell you a 

3000
02:16:22,611 --> 02:16:25,500
little story.
This is all done by the insurance 

3001
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:27,171
agencies obviously,
but it's just fascinating to see what's 

3002
02:16:27,171 --> 02:16:31,041
going on and what I was trying to always
show to people is that people always go 

3003
02:16:31,041 --> 02:16:34,351
Somali pirates.
There isn't actually much piracy there 

3004
02:16:34,351 --> 02:16:34,351
anymore.
Very,

3005
02:16:34,351 --> 02:16:38,131
very little.
Most of it's actually the Straits of 

3006
02:16:38,131 --> 02:16:40,591
Malacca Singapore around.
They're real and most of the piracy is 

3007
02:16:40,591 --> 02:16:41,800
we're the largest shipping channels are 
basically.

3008
02:16:42,020 --> 02:16:43,640
Well,
the Somalian story we've talked about on

3009
02:16:43,641 --> 02:16:48,641
the podcast many times,
unfortunately I don't want to reiterate 

3010
02:16:48,641 --> 02:16:51,731
it,
but those people were forced into it 

3011
02:16:51,731 --> 02:16:55,570
because of people dumping toxic waste 
are fishermen were dumping toxic waste 

3012
02:16:55,570 --> 02:17:00,401
off their shores and they kidnap them to
try to stop this dumping and then they 

3013
02:17:00,561 --> 02:17:02,840
got a massive ransom and realize like,
whoa,

3014
02:17:02,870 --> 02:17:03,800
hey,
fuck fishing.

3015
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:05,520
Just start kidnapping people.

3016
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:10,920
No,
no one turns into a pirate or a 

3017
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:10,920
terrorist.
It's a.

3018
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:14,090
it's a function of where they've grown 
up and the experiences they've had that 

3019
02:17:14,090 --> 02:17:14,090
have pushed them to that limit.
You know,

3020
02:17:14,090 --> 02:17:14,290
you've pushed them

3021
02:17:14,460 --> 02:17:17,130
to the edge.
There's always a reason for it.

3022
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:22,280
Well,
the battle for resources and the 

3023
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:24,231
inequality of the resources and what you
can get in the world,

3024
02:17:24,271 --> 02:17:27,180
it just leads people to desperation and 
that's what,

3025
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:29,220
you know,
going back to the alien thing,

3026
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:33,630
that's what we would hope one day we 
would get past when you get past this.

3027
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:38,840
I mean we,
we'd understand that like if we just 

3028
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:38,840
looked at the world,
I mean if somehow or another we realized

3029
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:42,120
that there's some sort of is a way to be
completely altruistic,

3030
02:17:42,121 --> 02:17:47,121
right?
There's a way to be completely even and 

3031
02:17:47,121 --> 02:17:47,280
fair and we would look at the globe and 
say,

3032
02:17:47,281 --> 02:17:48,870
well look,
there's plenty of resources.

3033
02:17:48,871 --> 02:17:53,871
We have boats and ships and let's just 
evenly distributed all this stuff and 

3034
02:17:53,871 --> 02:17:55,260
figure out a way we could all live in 
harmony and everybody contribute,

3035
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:56,070
but

3036
02:17:57,590 --> 02:18:02,590
it's.
It's difficult with the way things are 

3037
02:18:02,590 --> 02:18:05,331
right now.
It's very difficult to move into that 

3038
02:18:05,331 --> 02:18:05,331
place.
We'd have to have some sort of a massive

3039
02:18:05,331 --> 02:18:09,680
transcendence.
I'd like to go more into the whole 

3040
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:09,680
climate change thing normally before I 
bring this up,

3041
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:12,350
but at the same time I started off very 
optimistic.

3042
02:18:12,390 --> 02:18:14,520
I started doing climate change talks,
2007.

3043
02:18:14,550 --> 02:18:16,620
I was very,
very optimistic that we can do this,

3044
02:18:16,621 --> 02:18:18,180
we can do this,
we can do this now.

3045
02:18:18,181 --> 02:18:21,910
Fast forward almost 10 years later and 
I'm apocalyptic mystic.

3046
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:24,110
Yeah,
it's I,

3047
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:26,820
I think really if we want to change 
what's going on now,

3048
02:18:28,230 --> 02:18:31,470
like any problem with when adults come 
to you with a problem,

3049
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:36,500
have you tried turning it on and off?
I really think we kind of.

3050
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:39,480
We get to the point now where we really 
got to turn it all off and then start it

3051
02:18:39,481 --> 02:18:43,290
back up again in a carbon neutral kind 
of way.

3052
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:46,560
That's what we're getting to right now 
because what we're seeing now,

3053
02:18:46,860 --> 02:18:48,450
this is something that eludes most 
people.

3054
02:18:49,410 --> 02:18:54,410
The effects we're seeing now,
which is two degrees Celsius above 

3055
02:18:54,410 --> 02:18:58,060
degrees Celsius about industrial reits.
The attic at the moment is 12 to 16 

3056
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:01,110
degrees Celsius above the average 
preindustrial time.

3057
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:03,840
All this sort of stuff going on.
It's,

3058
02:19:03,990 --> 02:19:08,990
it's,
there's a 40 year lag between what we 

3059
02:19:08,990 --> 02:19:10,740
pump out in pollution and CEO to,
to what the actual temperature rises.

3060
02:19:10,890 --> 02:19:14,550
So what we're seeing now is from the mid
seventies,

3061
02:19:15,510 --> 02:19:16,950
we haven't even got up to the eighties 
yet.

3062
02:19:17,220 --> 02:19:18,780
That's bananas.
Yeah.

3063
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,660
You imagine what the next 10 years.
The eighties.

3064
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:22,740
What?
What the what we did to the world during

3065
02:19:22,741 --> 02:19:23,160
the eighties.

3066
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:25,530
When you're in Antarctica,
do you look for places to move?

3067
02:19:25,650 --> 02:19:26,220
Just say,
Ooh,

3068
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:28,610
built a house here.
Thirty years.

3069
02:19:28,611 --> 02:19:30,290
It'd be the shit.
It's.

3070
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:31,730
It's not too far off.
No,

3071
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:34,220
it's actually really quite well in the 
Antarctic peninsula.

3072
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:37,250
It's a bit of a hot spot as well.
It's warm.

3073
02:19:37,251 --> 02:19:42,251
I've got a picture,
I've got a picture there of me in t 

3074
02:19:42,251 --> 02:19:46,541
shirts and shorts.
So you're talking this 30 degrees 

3075
02:19:46,541 --> 02:19:47,200
Celsius warmer there,
which is what does that in America?

3076
02:19:47,670 --> 02:19:49,780
In America Fair.
Fair enough.

3077
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:52,310
Okay.
So we've talked about the Arctic.

3078
02:19:52,311 --> 02:19:56,840
The Arctic at the moment is in some 
areas about 12 degrees Celsius above the

3079
02:19:56,841 --> 02:20:00,520
preindustrial levels.
So God,

3080
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:04,160
I never go to Fahrenheit,
but I would say yeah,

3081
02:20:04,250 --> 02:20:05,740
24,
almost 30,

3082
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:11,080
33 is very annoying that we have 
different ways of telling the 

3083
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:13,961
temperature that is so goofy and 
kilograms to like when we go to England 

3084
02:20:14,940 --> 02:20:15,980
is the most ridiculous.

3085
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:20,480
They have stone when we do weigh ins for
the UFC in England with 13 stone,

3086
02:20:20,510 --> 02:20:24,710
like what are you even talking about?
Why you've met stones,

3087
02:20:24,711 --> 02:20:29,711
like what?
Thirteen pounds or something crazy like 

3088
02:20:29,711 --> 02:20:30,260
that.
Some random ancient fucking king shit.

3089
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:35,320
Somebody had a rock and they wanted 
everybody to be measured by that route 

3090
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:35,540
to put this out there.
Metric system is a wonderful thing.

3091
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:40,660
So way to go.
We should have adopted it should we 

3092
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:43,751
tried.
When I was in high school before high 

3093
02:20:43,751 --> 02:20:43,751
school,
I believe,

3094
02:20:43,751 --> 02:20:43,751
I believe junior high school,
there were.

3095
02:20:43,751 --> 02:20:48,350
There was an attempt to indoctrinate the
American people on soccer and the metric

3096
02:20:48,351 --> 02:20:50,870
system wholesale.
We're like,

3097
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:54,200
no,
we dug our heels in.

3098
02:20:54,610 --> 02:20:58,070
No soccer.
I cannot understand but a metric system.

3099
02:20:58,490 --> 02:21:01,700
I just.
I wonder like when you're in school,

3100
02:21:01,701 --> 02:21:06,380
like trying to learn maths and science,
not using the metric system.

3101
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:08,030
That must be hard work,
man.

3102
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:12,380
You remember all that sort of stuff.
It's kind of silly because you can do,

3103
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:16,070
you can see the metric system is better.
It's a better system.

3104
02:21:16,071 --> 02:21:21,071
It's a system of 10.
You know when you get into inches and 

3105
02:21:21,071 --> 02:21:23,030
yards and systems of 12,
12 inches and like,

3106
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:25,520
okay,
how many yards is a.

3107
02:21:25,521 --> 02:21:28,160
What was a meter to a yard is how much 
difference.

3108
02:21:28,161 --> 02:21:30,650
Okay.
Ninety meters is almost the same,

3109
02:21:30,651 --> 02:21:35,651
but there's,
there's variables and then the kilos 

3110
02:21:35,651 --> 02:21:39,611
thing,
the kilograms and measuring that and 

3111
02:21:39,611 --> 02:21:39,611
Fahrenheit and Celsius.
It's,

3112
02:21:39,611 --> 02:21:41,210
it's dumb.
Like one system would be great.

3113
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:46,660
They could have done it.
They could have stuck with it in the 

3114
02:21:46,660 --> 02:21:46,660
sixties and the seventies.
We could have been all right.

3115
02:21:46,660 --> 02:21:48,310
Right now man,
don't the rest of the world.

3116
02:21:48,550 --> 02:21:50,570
We're wherever with metric system.
Come join us.

3117
02:21:50,571 --> 02:21:53,780
We're not England though.
They had the stones,

3118
02:21:53,781 --> 02:21:55,850
but they have miles.
Yeah,

3119
02:21:56,030 --> 02:21:56,710
Yup.
Yeah,

3120
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:58,210
Yup.
You sure?

3121
02:21:58,211 --> 02:22:00,020
I'm pretty sure.
I don't think these kilometers.

3122
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:02,840
See if England uses miles.
I think these miles,

3123
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:05,270
I think they use inches,
feet miles.

3124
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:08,930
Pretty sure if they use inches and feet 
and he was kilometers,

3125
02:22:08,931 --> 02:22:10,880
they're retarded.
No wacky.

3126
02:22:10,910 --> 02:22:14,060
I fill it.
It was you guys and a USA in Bhutan were

3127
02:22:14,061 --> 02:22:15,770
the only people in the be looking like 
that.

3128
02:22:16,220 --> 02:22:18,720
Let's see.
Uh,

3129
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:21,290
they longed.
What does it say in the UK?

3130
02:22:21,291 --> 02:22:26,030
Miles are used almost exclusively on 
road signs I just used in

3131
02:22:26,030 --> 02:22:26,700
road sense.
Yeah.

3132
02:22:27,090 --> 02:22:28,020
Interesting.
Interesting.

3133
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:29,150
Well,
I'm thinking in there,

3134
02:22:29,730 --> 02:22:34,730
not just road science.
I think they also use it on their 

3135
02:22:34,730 --> 02:22:34,730
spirometers like,
you know,

3136
02:22:34,730 --> 02:22:36,720
35 miles an hour because you.
Have you ever spent Amr?

3137
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:41,750
I mean,
they're not going to use it just on the 

3138
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:43,101
road.
Signs of their fucking car doesn't say 

3139
02:22:43,101 --> 02:22:45,111
what it is.
I'm sure it's in their automobiles to 

3140
02:22:45,111 --> 02:22:45,111
tweed.
Having a mixed like that isn't.

3141
02:22:45,111 --> 02:22:46,480
It is weird.
It wasn't too aware of that.

3142
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:48,660
Will England's not a mix.
They use that.

3143
02:22:48,670 --> 02:22:53,670
We are their system.
I mean the reason why we use inches and 

3144
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:57,381
feet,
feet and all that jazz was because of 

3145
02:22:57,381 --> 02:22:57,381
them.
Miles.

3146
02:22:57,381 --> 02:22:57,381
That's,
that's England.

3147
02:22:57,381 --> 02:22:58,680
What we did too.
Of course in Australia we got smart.

3148
02:22:58,681 --> 02:23:01,200
You guys wised up.
Another reason why Australia is awesome,

3149
02:23:02,010 --> 02:23:02,710
as I said,
we,

3150
02:23:03,140 --> 02:23:04,380
we have our moments,
we do.

3151
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:06,660
We were the second nation,
let women vote.

3152
02:23:07,390 --> 02:23:12,390
We got a lot of good things behind us 
that being very progressive and kind of 

3153
02:23:12,390 --> 02:23:13,830
ahead of the loop on a few things,
but who's the first us,

3154
02:23:13,980 --> 02:23:15,190
New Zealand,
New Zealand.

3155
02:23:15,210 --> 02:23:17,130
The first people that people.
Women vote.

3156
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:19,230
Yeah.
Goddamn beautiful.

3157
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:24,380
It's a beautiful kind of.
A buddy of mine was over there right 

3158
02:23:24,380 --> 02:23:24,380
now.
Send me some pictures.

3159
02:23:24,380 --> 02:23:24,380
I was like,
yeah,

3160
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:26,250
it's a pretty place.
I try and get there wherever I can.

3161
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:31,400
What is your favorite place to visit or 
do you have a favorite place you've 

3162
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:31,400
explored?
I mean,

3163
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:34,380
you've literally been.
Because every,

3164
02:23:34,381 --> 02:23:36,320
every expedition.
I don't give me a favor.

3165
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:41,390
Tell me about something awesome.
Every expedition I do has something 

3166
02:23:41,390 --> 02:23:41,580
amazing that we do,
you know?

3167
02:23:41,581 --> 02:23:44,160
And so every single one,
there's one place that I really,

3168
02:23:44,161 --> 02:23:45,660
really like.
Um,

3169
02:23:45,661 --> 02:23:48,960
so there's lots and yeah,
it's hot.

3170
02:23:48,990 --> 02:23:51,510
But if you were to specify specific 
expedition,

3171
02:23:51,511 --> 02:23:52,620
I can tell you the highlights of it.

3172
02:23:52,620 --> 02:23:57,620
So probably one of my favorite place in 
the world at the moment is south 

3173
02:23:57,620 --> 02:23:57,620
Georgia,
which is a,

3174
02:23:57,620 --> 02:23:58,450
you know,
the Falkland Islands,

3175
02:23:58,760 --> 02:24:01,140
it's just over a little bit further into
the,

3176
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:06,260
into the ocean there east.
And so you've got this little tiny rock 

3177
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:08,370
in the middle of a big ocean and all the
animals have to go somewhere.

3178
02:24:08,371 --> 02:24:11,130
So they all go to this little tiny rock.
So you go on this beach,

3179
02:24:11,250 --> 02:24:12,260
St Andrews,
Bang,

3180
02:24:12,270 --> 02:24:15,300
you've got 400,000
king penguins,

3181
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:20,320
you know,
on this one little beach is just thick 

3182
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:21,720
with animals and,
and it had a lot of ceiling.

3183
02:24:21,721 --> 02:24:26,721
But now the first year of coming back 
and so you literally get to these 

3184
02:24:26,721 --> 02:24:29,571
beaches and you kind of got to try and 
make your way through the penguins and 

3185
02:24:29,571 --> 02:24:30,150
the seals to actually get ashore.
It's that crazy.

3186
02:24:30,210 --> 02:24:35,210
And one of my favorite things to do 
there is I just laid down on the beach 

3187
02:24:35,210 --> 02:24:37,020
and all the little tiny baby first seal 
pups,

3188
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:39,060
little tiny things with bobbly heads.

3189
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:41,160
They all come up and they pile on top of
you.

3190
02:24:41,161 --> 02:24:44,790
And it's just amazing,
amazing experience to be in.

3191
02:24:44,791 --> 02:24:49,290
Amongst so many animals that are just as
inquisitive about you as they are.

3192
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:52,140
Yeah.
There's some crazy,

3193
02:24:52,141 --> 02:24:53,730
crazy shots there.
Wow.

3194
02:24:53,731 --> 02:24:55,930
That's so beautiful.
It's a,

3195
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:57,510
it's a stunning spot.
I've got,

3196
02:24:57,560 --> 02:25:00,090
um,
I've got some images somewhere as well.

3197
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:05,200
The,
the perspective that you gain from 

3198
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:05,810
visiting all these amazing places.
Um,

3199
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:09,960
and then when you come and you talk to 
people that sort of live in one city and

3200
02:25:09,961 --> 02:25:12,840
never leave that,
you feel bad for those people.

3201
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:16,620
Everyone's got their own,
their own path.

3202
02:25:16,690 --> 02:25:17,930
You know,
everyone's thinking.

3203
02:25:17,970 --> 02:25:20,700
You all zen.
That's true.

3204
02:25:20,910 --> 02:25:21,690
I,
I don't,

3205
02:25:21,870 --> 02:25:25,000
I mean I guess a little bit of pity,
maybe a little bit of like,

3206
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:30,020
Oh,
you don't have a passport that sound 

3207
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:30,020
fortunate to live in this wildlife 
adventure.

3208
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:34,961
I mean,
it's an insane path and I think there's 

3209
02:25:34,961 --> 02:25:36,660
something cool about talking to people 
that travel all over the world.

3210
02:25:36,661 --> 02:25:39,310
It's like they have a perspective.
It's almost like they're like,

3211
02:25:39,790 --> 02:25:40,860
oh,
okay.

3212
02:25:40,930 --> 02:25:42,520
Like you go to a bunch of different 
places,

3213
02:25:42,521 --> 02:25:44,950
you see a bunch of different ways that 
people live and you go,

3214
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:46,060
oh,
all right,

3215
02:25:46,390 --> 02:25:49,960
there's not really one way to do this.
There's no better way or bad way.

3216
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:52,480
There's just different ways to do so,
which is,

3217
02:25:52,850 --> 02:25:54,730
that's what you see everywhere.
Um,

3218
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:55,480
yeah,
you know,

3219
02:25:55,481 --> 02:26:00,481
I've got some friends who left high 
school and they married the local 

3220
02:26:00,481 --> 02:26:03,811
mechanic and don't even have a passport 
to dude who's married and mechanic what 

3221
02:26:03,811 --> 02:26:04,060
I'm talking about.

3222
02:26:04,230 --> 02:26:05,540
Female girls,
but whatever.

3223
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:11,220
Same difference,
but basically never left the town that 

3224
02:26:11,220 --> 02:26:11,220
they grew up in.
You know,

3225
02:26:11,220 --> 02:26:11,380
and that's it.
That's what they do.

3226
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:14,110
Maybe that town as mushrooms and the 
trip in a different way.

3227
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:16,810
There's a lot of cow Patty Duke who do,
do,

3228
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:17,830
do,
do,

3229
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:18,610
do,
do,

3230
02:26:18,611 --> 02:26:19,240
do,
do.

3231
02:26:19,450 --> 02:26:24,450
But I think about that when I,
when I think of traveling to different 

3232
02:26:24,450 --> 02:26:27,451
cultures and experiencing these really 
incredibly varied ways of living that 

3233
02:26:28,931 --> 02:26:33,931
people have.
I always think new look at all the 

3234
02:26:33,931 --> 02:26:33,931
different varieties of,
of life.

3235
02:26:33,931 --> 02:26:38,260
Like I posted this instagram video last 
night of this jellyfish that I saw in an

3236
02:26:38,261 --> 02:26:41,820
aquarium and I remember thinking when I 
was looking at that jellyfish,

3237
02:26:41,830 --> 02:26:44,410
like what if that thing was on another 
planet?

3238
02:26:44,411 --> 02:26:48,010
We would think it would be the most 
fascinating discovery that man is.

3239
02:26:48,730 --> 02:26:51,490
Don't even get me started.
There's jellyfish that are immortal,

3240
02:26:52,390 --> 02:26:57,390
immortal,
like literally they live for live 

3241
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:57,390
forever.

3242
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:57,390
Look at that thing.
I think.

3243
02:26:57,390 --> 02:27:01,950
Yeah,
that was a great little video 

3244
02:27:01,950 --> 02:27:01,950
cephalopods.
I think if you're talking about aliens,

3245
02:27:01,950 --> 02:27:06,660
underwater cephalopods is where it's at.
And cephalopods the Nautilus Nautilus,

3246
02:27:06,671 --> 02:27:11,671
Shell Octopus,
squid and cuttlefish and cuddle fish on 

3247
02:27:11,671 --> 02:27:14,830
my favorite creature.
Actually,

3248
02:27:14,831 --> 02:27:19,831
Jamie,
there's a video on my youtube channel 

3249
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:19,831
called Adam verse cuttle fish.
You'll,

3250
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:20,080
you'll dig it.
Um,

3251
02:27:20,110 --> 02:27:21,490
me just free diamond with the 
cuttlefish,

3252
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:23,050
but they're the most amazing,
amazing,

3253
02:27:23,051 --> 02:27:26,290
great trailer and the alien in so many 
respects.

3254
02:27:26,291 --> 02:27:28,560
And a lot of the research on them is 
only like five years older.

3255
02:27:28,570 --> 02:27:33,570
So we're still working stuff out because
they're the fastest color and texture 

3256
02:27:33,570 --> 02:27:34,750
chamber in the world.
They like a neon sign,

3257
02:27:34,751 --> 02:27:39,751
pulsating color shoe.
I think it's about 390 DPI is the 

3258
02:27:39,751 --> 02:27:40,190
resolution they can predict on this 
scheme.

3259
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:43,450
It's just phenomenal.
They have three hearts.

3260
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,180
They don't have hemoglobin that I've 
read blood.

3261
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:48,010
They've green blood.
It's kind of a copper based blood.

3262
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:51,580
I'm a little bit less inefficient.
Hence they have three hearts.

3263
02:27:51,990 --> 02:27:53,620
Um,
they have like a jet engine,

3264
02:27:53,621 --> 02:27:58,621
they pump water and around their head 
and push it out a little nozzle at the 

3265
02:27:58,621 --> 02:27:58,621
front.
Um,

3266
02:27:58,621 --> 02:28:02,810
look at that thing.
It's like an octopus with tiny legs in 

3267
02:28:02,810 --> 02:28:05,530
the cephalopod family as well.
So this one's got a cuttlefish bone,

3268
02:28:05,531 --> 02:28:10,531
so it's neutrally buoyant.
It's kind of just floating off the 

3269
02:28:10,531 --> 02:28:10,531
surface,
but it looks like whatever's behind it.

3270
02:28:10,531 --> 02:28:14,791
It's very,
very good at camouflage and also 

3271
02:28:14,791 --> 02:28:17,731
communicates via color as well.
But what we couldn't work out for many 

3272
02:28:17,731 --> 02:28:19,180
years,
once you put them in a dark box and they

3273
02:28:19,181 --> 02:28:24,181
will still mimic.
So you put in a box with no light 

3274
02:28:24,181 --> 02:28:24,181
whatsoever.
They

3275
02:28:24,181 --> 02:28:27,070
will still mimic whatever is behind them
even though there's no light there to 

3276
02:28:27,070 --> 02:28:27,610
actually use.
And then they would also mimic color and

3277
02:28:27,611 --> 02:28:32,611
get their eyes.
What do you mean they will mimic what's 

3278
02:28:32,611 --> 02:28:32,611
behind them?
I mean there are many youth,

3279
02:28:32,611 --> 02:28:36,180
a wall put a cuttlefish in a box pitch 
black and you put a triangle,

3280
02:28:36,261 --> 02:28:41,261
a triangle shape behind them.
They will mimic on the other side of 

3281
02:28:41,261 --> 02:28:42,590
triangle shape in their skin.
And we still,

3282
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:45,230
we're still trying to work out how they 
do this because there's no light.

3283
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:48,920
And we knew that they did it with a 
color that their eyes don't see color.

3284
02:28:48,921 --> 02:28:50,830
I see black and white,
heavy amount of contrast.

3285
02:28:50,860 --> 02:28:54,890
We actually only two years ago,
they worked out in their skin.

3286
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:57,230
They see color via their skin or their 
eyes.

3287
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:00,860
I can go on.
It's crazy.

3288
02:29:00,861 --> 02:29:03,020
There's sexual reproduction is mom is 
really cool.

3289
02:29:03,560 --> 02:29:08,560
They don't.
They have a lack of our offices that 

3290
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:08,560
don't have too many artifices to use.
So we asked and are.

3291
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:13,490
So what they do is the male cuttlefish 
gets an arm and sticks it up his 

3292
02:29:13,490 --> 02:29:14,750
nostril,
we'll call it a nostril.

3293
02:29:14,780 --> 02:29:15,680
It's an artifice,
whatever,

3294
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:21,100
and pulls out a sack of sperm and then 
goes up to the female and then sticks 

3295
02:29:21,100 --> 02:29:22,130
that arm with the sacral sperm.
Lauren up her nostril,

3296
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:27,160
left nostril.
And that's how they reproduce what?

3297
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:31,040
Yeah,
it's sack fisting.

3298
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:34,720
Take a sack of sperm and they fixed it 
up

3299
02:29:34,780 --> 02:29:38,840
your nose and nostrils.
The same orifice they use for smelling.

3300
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:41,770
Um,
we call it industrial,

3301
02:29:41,771 --> 02:29:44,460
but it's just a whole.
It's just a whole.

3302
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:47,710
But it's the closest one to their sexual
watch it here.

3303
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:49,630
Oh God,
I'm not prepared for this.

3304
02:29:49,631 --> 02:29:54,631
January cuddles grabbing her.
And he died straight after that.

3305
02:29:57,101 --> 02:29:58,650
Actually.
Yeah.

3306
02:29:58,660 --> 02:30:01,620
They only live for about 18 months.
So the Australian giant cuttle fish,

3307
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:02,950
different cuttlefish,
different things,

3308
02:30:02,951 --> 02:30:04,810
but 18 months.
So they do that.

3309
02:30:04,811 --> 02:30:06,160
They reproduced,
they die.

3310
02:30:06,610 --> 02:30:11,610
My Friend,
Remy Warren has this show called Apex 

3311
02:30:11,610 --> 02:30:11,610
Predator where he,
um,

3312
02:30:11,610 --> 02:30:15,490
he travels to all these different 
environments and tries to figure out how

3313
02:30:15,491 --> 02:30:18,760
these various apex predators hunt their 
food and how they do it.

3314
02:30:18,761 --> 02:30:23,761
And he said without a doubt that the 
most fascinating one that he did he 

3315
02:30:24,460 --> 02:30:28,990
studied was the octopus and it's like 
they are some kind of an alien creature.

3316
02:30:29,690 --> 02:30:32,350
And when I didn't know until he came on 
the show,

3317
02:30:32,351 --> 02:30:37,351
like how quickly they can change into 
the background that was like completely 

3318
02:30:38,021 --> 02:30:41,020
camouflaged,
not just in color but also in texture.

3319
02:30:41,021 --> 02:30:42,670
They mimic the texture behind them.

3320
02:30:43,270 --> 02:30:43,930
It's,
I mean,

3321
02:30:43,990 --> 02:30:45,700
it's hard to find them when you're scuba
diving.

3322
02:30:45,701 --> 02:30:48,770
It's actually hard to find them because 
they look exactly like what a them.

3323
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:50,860
Um,
they have so many,

3324
02:30:50,890 --> 02:30:53,350
like the more research you do on,
they're just amazing.

3325
02:30:53,351 --> 02:30:55,420
They have the intelligence of a six year
old child.

3326
02:30:55,710 --> 02:31:00,710
Um,
and so they've been actually class 

3327
02:31:00,710 --> 02:31:01,040
recently as like,
I forget the word,

3328
02:31:01,041 --> 02:31:02,590
like sentience beans or something like 
that.

3329
02:31:02,591 --> 02:31:07,591
So they're in the same class as dogs and
monkeys and dolphins not do tests on 

3330
02:31:07,961 --> 02:31:09,760
them that harmed them.
Basically.

3331
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,860
Biggest still going for Sushi.
Oh yeah,

3332
02:31:11,861 --> 02:31:13,000
you can kill them.
You just can't.

3333
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:17,500
You can still get grilled octopus.
It's like grilled six year old.

3334
02:31:17,950 --> 02:31:19,920
I mean you probably,

3335
02:31:20,300 --> 02:31:23,670
it's a strange thing that we do and we 
decide what we will eat,

3336
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:29,510
what will we.
And it varies hugely uncultured well 

3337
02:31:29,510 --> 02:31:33,090
that we don't eat dog here,
but mean I made a mistake of watching a 

3338
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:39,320
piece.
I think it was a vice piece on that 

3339
02:31:39,320 --> 02:31:40,170
Yulin dog festival and I was like,
whoa man,

3340
02:31:40,890 --> 02:31:42,810
good Lord it.
But again,

3341
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:47,100
it's entirely cultural because if you 
were an Indian person who is a Hindu and

3342
02:31:47,101 --> 02:31:50,490
you see what we do to cows,
that would be equally,

3343
02:31:50,491 --> 02:31:53,820
if not more deserving because their cows
are wholly what I love.

3344
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:56,580
I haven't done much India,
but I've done the poll is that,

3345
02:31:56,581 --> 02:31:57,570
no,
we don't eat this cow,

3346
02:31:57,571 --> 02:31:59,220
this cow sacred,
but this buffalo,

3347
02:31:59,580 --> 02:32:04,030
it's tasty.
You just like what the together with the

3348
02:32:04,410 --> 02:32:06,420
bird egg people and try to figure this 
out.

3349
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:11,720
It's just when you see certain 
traditions that exist in these cultures 

3350
02:32:12,061 --> 02:32:15,150
and try to decipher like how,
how they got started,

3351
02:32:15,870 --> 02:32:17,040
there's always a reason for it.

3352
02:32:17,070 --> 02:32:19,500
You can't go back.
You can always just send a recent of why

3353
02:32:19,501 --> 02:32:20,500
this started.
This was,

3354
02:32:20,501 --> 02:32:25,501
you know,
don't eat pork here will you get 

3355
02:32:25,501 --> 02:32:25,501
Salmonella and it kills you.
You know,

3356
02:32:25,501 --> 02:32:27,810
of course.
Always a risk that's for kosher food and

3357
02:32:27,811 --> 02:32:32,811
things along those inspirational people 
have this hugely complex system of who 

3358
02:32:32,811 --> 02:32:34,440
you are allowed to talk to,
who you're allowed to marry.

3359
02:32:34,441 --> 02:32:39,441
This things called skins and takes a 
long time to come and get your head 

3360
02:32:39,441 --> 02:32:42,651
around.
But when you look at the science behind 

3361
02:32:42,651 --> 02:32:44,811
it,
it's the most efficient way ever 

3362
02:32:44,811 --> 02:32:47,871
conceived by humanity to ancient 
cultures to prevent inbreeding.

3363
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:51,260
So you're not allowed to talk to your 
sister.

3364
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:56,840
Can't talk to her and Kinda talk to 
because he might have sex with him so I 

3365
02:32:56,840 --> 02:32:56,840
won't have sex.
My sister.

3366
02:32:56,840 --> 02:32:57,840
We would trust.
That's gross,

3367
02:32:58,260 --> 02:33:01,240
but they can't talk to their sister.
Yeah.

3368
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:06,260
And generally their mother as well.
Well that makes you want to fuck your 

3369
02:33:06,260 --> 02:33:06,260
sister more.
It's like damn.

3370
02:33:06,260 --> 02:33:07,470
It must be good.
I'm trying to keep me away from her.

3371
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:10,080
Yeah,
you're a little twisted.

3372
02:33:11,010 --> 02:33:12,660
I'm not saying me,
man.

3373
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,230
I'm just,
you know,

3374
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:18,690
hypothetically this person that lived a 
long,

3375
02:33:18,691 --> 02:33:20,670
long time ago when they came up these 
weird rules.

3376
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:23,530
Um,
is it possible for a restroom?

3377
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:25,980
Just be two seconds and then we're gonna
come back.

3378
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:27,510
Maybe some climate change will.
Sure,

3379
02:33:27,511 --> 02:33:28,230
yeah,
absolutely.

3380
02:33:28,231 --> 02:33:29,640
Short reproduction.
What do you like your watch,

3381
02:33:29,641 --> 02:33:32,140
man?
That was a cool watch that um,

3382
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:33,510
it's,
it's actually quite cheap.

3383
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:34,570
That's cool.
Look.

3384
02:33:34,571 --> 02:33:35,850
And it doesn't have to be expensive 
copays.

3385
02:33:36,010 --> 02:33:37,080
You like to have a look?
No,

3386
02:33:37,160 --> 02:33:38,310
I'm good.
Don't worry about it.

3387
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:41,280
Alright,
we'll be back again.

3388
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:46,640
I when the bladder war,
I like to find someone who could sit 

3389
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:48,240
here and drink coffee and whiskey as 
long as we can.

3390
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:49,610
Oh,
what the fuck's wrong?

3391
02:33:49,790 --> 02:33:52,640
Do you think my bladder has changed?
It must've changed a.

3392
02:33:52,750 --> 02:33:57,750
This is not stuff that I was born with.
I think it's just from doing three hour 

3393
02:33:57,750 --> 02:34:00,030
podcasts like like right now if I had to
pee it will be a struggle.

3394
02:34:00,990 --> 02:34:03,930
I've been sitting here drinking coffee.
I had a glass of whiskey with him,

3395
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:06,900
Jack and coke diet coke of course.
Because of my diet.

3396
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:08,690
Like a truck driver?
Yeah,

3397
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:09,960
developed it.
I wonder.

3398
02:34:10,050 --> 02:34:15,050
I'd like to have a competition with 
truck drivers so who could hold their 

3399
02:34:15,050 --> 02:34:15,930
pis longer?
They could pull over though.

3400
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:18,400
Truck driver could pull over like two 
hours in.

3401
02:34:18,401 --> 02:34:20,980
Just pull over man.
I've left podcast before.

3402
02:34:20,981 --> 02:34:22,480
I have.
I've timed it poorly.

3403
02:34:22,630 --> 02:34:27,630
You know what it is if I don't pee right
before the show it could get because 

3404
02:34:27,630 --> 02:34:29,890
then I might've gotten it hours without 
peeing.

3405
02:34:30,070 --> 02:34:31,480
It's weird.
It doesn't break the seal.

3406
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:34,160
You know like when you eat,
when you're drinking first,

3407
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:36,070
then you gotta go every 20,
30 minutes.

3408
02:34:36,071 --> 02:34:39,220
Sometimes it happens to me.
Hmm.

3409
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:43,150
It got the UFC event one time.
I shouldn't have gone at all.

3410
02:34:43,151 --> 02:34:44,770
I have just held it will,
you know,

3411
02:34:44,771 --> 02:34:47,710
where it breaks me,
monster energy drinks.

3412
02:34:48,130 --> 02:34:53,130
I don't drink those fuckers anymore,
but at the UFC they have those and 

3413
02:34:53,130 --> 02:34:55,780
sometimes you know,
you're doing six hours of commentary,

3414
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:58,290
you want a little caffeine,
but uh,

3415
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:03,360
I would have those monsters and man that
I would have to piss like within an 

3416
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:03,430
hour.
It's crazy.

3417
02:35:03,431 --> 02:35:08,431
Like there's some stuff in them,
like there are some form of a diuretic 

3418
02:35:08,431 --> 02:35:10,540
in some way.
Maybe you would know this.

3419
02:35:10,541 --> 02:35:13,990
I looked up something yesterday when I 
was eating a burrito on a hot sauce.

3420
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:16,430
There's something called Xantham gum and
yeah,

3421
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:18,790
and it was like a thickening agent is 
what I read.

3422
02:35:19,330 --> 02:35:21,580
But when I was looking on the wikipedia 
about Xantham Gum,

3423
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:24,220
it says it's a,
it's used as a heavy,

3424
02:35:24,221 --> 02:35:27,070
a laxative.
Really.

3425
02:35:27,150 --> 02:35:32,150
Then in my head I was just like,
maybe that's what's making people shit 

3426
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:32,880
themselves with a lot of hot sauces that
not the hot sauce could be.

3427
02:35:33,550 --> 02:35:38,550
Could be.
I think there's a reaction that your 

3428
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:42,601
body has.
Your stomach has to hot sauce to your 

3429
02:35:42,601 --> 02:35:42,601
body.
Like what in the fuck?

3430
02:35:42,790 --> 02:35:46,480
And that makes you shit yourself to not 
really necessarily shit yourself as much

3431
02:35:46,481 --> 02:35:51,481
as have to take a shit.
How the hell did you get their bladder 

3432
02:35:51,481 --> 02:35:54,760
control?
Drinking hot sauce.

3433
02:35:54,790 --> 02:35:56,770
Xantham gum out of the room for 30 
seconds.

3434
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:59,080
Wow.
I've actually,

3435
02:35:59,081 --> 02:36:01,690
while I was kind of the toilet,
I just remembered pirates.

3436
02:36:01,810 --> 02:36:04,150
Yes.
Do you know why they have the earrings?

3437
02:36:04,151 --> 02:36:05,140
The Golden.
Because they're gay.

3438
02:36:05,141 --> 02:36:07,540
They're all gay.
Well actually you offered it right?

3439
02:36:07,541 --> 02:36:10,390
But they did say we're going to.
Sexuality is a big part of it.

3440
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:12,090
Well that was why they would do it.
I mean they were.

3441
02:36:12,110 --> 02:36:14,200
They would discuss why they dress so 
flamboyantly.

3442
02:36:15,070 --> 02:36:20,070
Yes.
But that's not why they were gold 

3443
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:20,070
earrings.
No,

3444
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:20,860
it was actually payment.
Full burial.

3445
02:36:20,920 --> 02:36:25,920
So when you got washed over overboard,
you end up floating up on a beach 

3446
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:25,920
somewhere.
We'd go bury you in.

3447
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:27,080
Then take the gold,
the golden.

3448
02:36:27,880 --> 02:36:29,250
That's a good deal.
Yeah.

3449
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:31,960
That's interesting.
I thought it was just to look cool.

3450
02:36:32,320 --> 02:36:34,870
Look like a bad ass with scarf was 
women.

3451
02:36:34,930 --> 02:36:37,710
It was the oldest game.
It was.

3452
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:40,540
There was women pirates.
But to be a woman pirate though,

3453
02:36:40,541 --> 02:36:43,180
you had to be able to be able to get 
away with.

3454
02:36:43,210 --> 02:36:48,210
You had to look like a male basically.
You had to be able to get away with 

3455
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:48,210
giving away.
Yeah,

3456
02:36:48,290 --> 02:36:53,290
it'd be like a softball player and type 
chick really likes crossfit thick neck 

3457
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:59,200
ones.
Still Very womanly,

3458
02:36:59,201 --> 02:37:02,820
but large style after traveling the 
world for,

3459
02:37:02,890 --> 02:37:07,890
for while the last few years,
I'm really big fan of yoga pants on 

3460
02:37:07,890 --> 02:37:08,110
airplanes.
Oh yes.

3461
02:37:09,210 --> 02:37:10,660
Yep.
They figured it out.

3462
02:37:10,661 --> 02:37:11,290
They figured it out.

3463
02:37:11,290 --> 02:37:14,640
It's amazing that it took so long,
but now girls would just rocking them.

3464
02:37:14,641 --> 02:37:16,040
I'm like,
bitch,

3465
02:37:16,041 --> 02:37:21,041
you ain't going to yoga.
You just want everybody to senior 

3466
02:37:21,041 --> 02:37:21,041
perfect ass.
How dare you walk around.

3467
02:37:21,041 --> 02:37:25,960
But men can't do that.
If you walk around with Yoga Pants and 

3468
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:26,290
your shaft is just bulging the front of 
your pants,

3469
02:37:26,330 --> 02:37:29,870
people would think you're rude,
like it's quite fine and dandy.

3470
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:34,920
It's sexist.
They're asked to be plump and right 

3471
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:37,250
there and all juicy and inviting.
But you can have your,

3472
02:37:37,251 --> 02:37:42,251
uh,
your man bits compressed and front and 

3473
02:37:42,251 --> 02:37:42,251
center,
there'll be rude,

3474
02:37:42,251 --> 02:37:44,780
right?
At least on a plane full of people,

3475
02:37:44,820 --> 02:37:49,820
which is not acceptable.
A man can't walk around with Yoga Pants 

3476
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:49,820
on.
Very few do,

3477
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:50,390
right?
Yeah.

3478
02:37:50,391 --> 02:37:52,010
I don't think I could.
I didn't think I could pull it off.

3479
02:37:52,760 --> 02:37:57,760
It's an argument for a large fanny pack 
yoga pants and a large fanny pack for a 

3480
02:37:57,760 --> 02:37:57,760
man.

3481
02:37:57,760 --> 02:37:58,230
It's like,
what is behind that thing?

3482
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:02,360
Wouldn't you like to know?
My eyes are up here fucker.

3483
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:03,560
Oh,
fanny pack.

3484
02:38:03,561 --> 02:38:04,790
That just cracks me up when you say 
that,

3485
02:38:05,090 --> 02:38:10,090
but because you guys.
The Vagina is a vagina in England and 

3486
02:38:10,090 --> 02:38:14,890
Australia as well.
But also we wouldn't be caught dead 

3487
02:38:14,890 --> 02:38:14,890
wearing an actual fanny pack bumbag 
would it be?

3488
02:38:15,310 --> 02:38:17,520
And then just not fashionable.
Um,

3489
02:38:17,540 --> 02:38:19,790
I wear one.
You wait one all the time.

3490
02:38:19,820 --> 02:38:22,760
I could see it's being useful.
It's amazing.

3491
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Yeah.
If you're not trying to get laid when 

3492
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:28,000
just rocket.
Do you want one?

3493
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:28,000
I have them.
I'm trying to get laid.

3494
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:32,840
So should we talk about climate change?
Is that something that you want to bring

3495
02:38:35,871 --> 02:38:40,871
up?
I'm just amazed at how many tangents 

3496
02:38:40,871 --> 02:38:40,871
you've been able to go on in the last 
few hours.

3497
02:38:41,090 --> 02:38:42,950
It's impressive where you're in this 
with me.

3498
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:43,480
Yeah,
I know.

3499
02:38:43,490 --> 02:38:44,440
It's both our faults.

3500
02:38:44,470 --> 02:38:45,660
Okay.
Um,

3501
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:48,110
so I don't know how much to talk about 
here.

3502
02:38:48,111 --> 02:38:50,270
Like you've got such an intelligent 
audience either.

3503
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:51,740
I don't listen,
don't,

3504
02:38:51,860 --> 02:38:55,100
don't get too crazy little monkeys out 
there listening to.

3505
02:38:55,610 --> 02:38:59,990
So I guess first thing is don't shoot 
the Messenger.

3506
02:39:00,020 --> 02:39:01,790
Normally when someone starts talking 
about climate change,

3507
02:39:01,791 --> 02:39:05,480
they look for reasons to shoot them.
Basically you need to,

3508
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:10,720
you know,
it's got such a political aspect to it 

3509
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:11,780
and let you got to disassociate that and
just look at the science,

3510
02:39:11,781 --> 02:39:13,280
you know,
and also take the whole.

3511
02:39:13,281 --> 02:39:15,620
I hate the word belief.
I believe in climate change.

3512
02:39:15,621 --> 02:39:18,980
Well two plus two equals four.
If you believe it's fine.

3513
02:39:19,010 --> 02:39:20,800
It doesn't really change the fact,
you know,

3514
02:39:21,440 --> 02:39:23,330
anyway,
it's got a whole lecture on this.

3515
02:39:23,331 --> 02:39:25,310
So I do,
do you do ted talks on this?

3516
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:26,300
Uh,
I had,

3517
02:39:26,301 --> 02:39:26,590
uh,
to,

3518
02:39:26,710 --> 02:39:28,190
to Chada on board the ship.

3519
02:39:28,220 --> 02:39:33,220
We had a mission Bluetooth,
which was all trying to ocean 

3520
02:39:33,220 --> 02:39:33,220
conservation,
Sylvia Earle,

3521
02:39:33,220 --> 02:39:33,980
heads of Ted talk.
Fascinating.

3522
02:39:34,010 --> 02:39:35,210
Fascinating.
Um,

3523
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:36,470
but,
uh,

3524
02:39:36,471 --> 02:39:37,970
yeah,
I just listened to them basically.

3525
02:39:38,450 --> 02:39:40,610
But um,
so then you have climate,

3526
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:43,730
which is what a big mistake people make 
is they go,

3527
02:39:43,790 --> 02:39:44,510
oh,
it's weather,

3528
02:39:44,511 --> 02:39:45,470
it's cold outside.
Well,

3529
02:39:45,471 --> 02:39:50,471
that's climate.
Climate is weather over very large 

3530
02:39:50,471 --> 02:39:52,670
timescales and that's a big one that 
people get wrong straight away.

3531
02:39:53,060 --> 02:39:54,830
Um,
but when you look at,

3532
02:39:55,580 --> 02:40:00,580
say 14,000
peer reviewed articles about climate 

3533
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:03,881
change,
there's only 24 that reject global 

3534
02:40:03,881 --> 02:40:03,881
warming.
So to have this whole thing,

3535
02:40:03,881 --> 02:40:05,420
there's a debate going on.
There is no debate.

3536
02:40:05,450 --> 02:40:07,190
There's a debate.
Twenty four people debate.

3537
02:40:07,720 --> 02:40:08,510
No,
I know what you're saying.

3538
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:11,540
I'm just joking.
You've seen the documentary,

3539
02:40:11,541 --> 02:40:13,870
I assume merchants of doubt.
Um,

3540
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:16,050
I think that one might have ms.me
actually.

3541
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:21,200
It's pretty fascinating.
I had Michael Shermer in here who's the 

3542
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:21,640
head of skeptic magazine magazine.

3543
02:40:21,650 --> 02:40:26,650
Michael Shermer is a pretty famous 
skeptic and he was with the skip toy 

3544
02:40:26,650 --> 02:40:26,880
one.
You ripped him a new one.

3545
02:40:26,881 --> 02:40:30,300
That was guys.
He did it himself a full.

3546
02:40:30,610 --> 02:40:33,060
Um,
but schermer is much more reasonable and

3547
02:40:33,061 --> 02:40:34,470
intelligent man.
But he was,

3548
02:40:34,471 --> 02:40:39,020
I'm talking about this documentary.
We actually brought it up.

3549
02:40:39,050 --> 02:40:44,050
I forgot that he was in it.
It was a documentary where it showed 

3550
02:40:44,050 --> 02:40:47,661
that the same people that were spreading
misinformation that were actually paid 

3551
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:50,910
to spread misinformation about 
cigarettes,

3552
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:55,110
about cigarettes being addictive were 
the very same people that were spreading

3553
02:40:55,111 --> 02:40:57,450
misinformation about climate change.
People will sell outfit.

3554
02:40:57,580 --> 02:40:58,770
Yeah,
exactly.

3555
02:40:58,771 --> 02:41:00,690
And they're just good at it.
They're good at bullshit.

3556
02:41:00,691 --> 02:41:01,900
Those 20 full people.
Yeah.

3557
02:41:02,070 --> 02:41:04,060
You look into it.
They're all paid by the state,

3558
02:41:04,100 --> 02:41:06,210
by the oil petroleum.
It's a little bit.

3559
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:08,130
Yeah.
So I mean you and me,

3560
02:41:08,131 --> 02:41:10,020
we now and the whole world kind of come 
around to,

3561
02:41:10,021 --> 02:41:11,850
in the last two years,
the world is warming.

3562
02:41:11,880 --> 02:41:16,880
We know this well,
no matter which way you look at what's 

3563
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:16,880
happening,
something's going on and people normally

3564
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:16,880
go,
oh well that's,

3565
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:19,020
you know,
solar and stuff like that going on.

3566
02:41:19,021 --> 02:41:23,250
But if you remove the solo,
you know from the equation,

3567
02:41:23,310 --> 02:41:28,310
it's still going up.
It's still going up because we 

3568
02:41:28,310 --> 02:41:30,711
understand the soul cycle's quite well,
we've done a lot of research on them so 

3569
02:41:30,711 --> 02:41:34,581
we know what's going on.
And then the other thing that people 

3570
02:41:34,581 --> 02:41:34,581
always say,
oh,

3571
02:41:34,581 --> 02:41:36,930
it's happened over and over again 
throughout history,

3572
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:39,300
you know,
and so this one's 800,000

3573
02:41:39,301 --> 02:41:44,301
years and yeah,
you see it psychically going up and 

3574
02:41:44,301 --> 02:41:46,521
down.
But I always like to look at the 

3575
02:41:46,521 --> 02:41:48,831
averages and the average is,
is kind of CEO to with an average and 

3576
02:41:48,831 --> 02:41:50,910
maybe to 25 parts per million.
You know what we're up to now,

3577
02:41:51,150 --> 02:41:53,970
what were like 403 at the moment.

3578
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:56,520
Okay.
So the average been to 50,

3579
02:41:56,580 --> 02:41:59,670
never got higher than 300 and we now are
at 400 or something.

3580
02:41:59,671 --> 02:42:03,150
So we're off the charts when it comes to
that and temperature the same.

3581
02:42:03,151 --> 02:42:05,250
It's always been a little colder than it
actually is today.

3582
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:09,240
And that's just because you know,
earth rotating around the sun.

3583
02:42:09,241 --> 02:42:11,460
A little bit of progression here,
a little bit of a tilt here.

3584
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:16,510
We understand this quite well,
otherwise we won't be able to make 

3585
02:42:16,510 --> 02:42:17,550
observations of the skies as closely as 
we do.

3586
02:42:18,750 --> 02:42:20,340
So people always go,
yes it's solar,

3587
02:42:20,341 --> 02:42:23,890
but if you look at solar since 1960,
70,

3588
02:42:24,030 --> 02:42:26,790
it's been going down.
But the amount of solar radiation,

3589
02:42:26,791 --> 02:42:31,791
the amount of energy that Sun's putting 
out that hits planet earth has been 

3590
02:42:31,791 --> 02:42:32,760
going down and yet temperature has been 
going up big time.

3591
02:42:33,180 --> 02:42:35,820
So right there you kind of can get away 
from the whole.

3592
02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:41,180
It's just natural cycles.
Something's really going on that's not 

3593
02:42:41,180 --> 02:42:41,910
meant to be there.
And so as of last year,

3594
02:42:41,911 --> 02:42:46,911
we crossed 400 parts per million co two 
in the atmosphere and actually between 

3595
02:42:46,911 --> 02:42:48,540
look at that spike.
That's crazy.

3596
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:53,340
From the 19 tens to 2015,
this is from 400,000

3597
02:42:53,341 --> 02:42:54,060
years ago.
No,

3598
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:55,590
but I mean the last spike.
Oh yeah.

3599
02:42:55,730 --> 02:42:57,750
Which shows 19.
Ten to 2015.

3600
02:42:57,751 --> 02:42:59,890
That's when it goes completely vertical.
Yeah.

3601
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:01,260
Straight up,
straight up.

3602
02:43:01,710 --> 02:43:06,710
And so,
I mean even in the last 12 months we've 

3603
02:43:06,710 --> 02:43:06,710
had the sharpest.
Rosin Sio two as well,

3604
02:43:06,710 --> 02:43:08,490
have about just under three parts per 
million.

3605
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:12,040
So it's still increasing.
It's not slowing

3606
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:14,020
down at all.
It's actually increasing big time.

3607
02:43:14,970 --> 02:43:17,820
Spike is crazy.
It's weird to look at.

3608
02:43:18,270 --> 02:43:23,270
Yeah,
it's like a rocket ship taking off 

3609
02:43:23,270 --> 02:43:23,270
straight up in the air.
Anytime you see this,

3610
02:43:23,270 --> 02:43:24,600
you know any scientist sees this,
Ooh,

3611
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:26,310
that's not,
that's not normal.

3612
02:43:26,311 --> 02:43:27,900
That's not what things.
A cyclic.

3613
02:43:27,901 --> 02:43:29,570
They don't just go the hockey,
whatever.

3614
02:43:29,571 --> 02:43:34,571
You got hockey stick.
Do you remember when an inconvenient 

3615
02:43:34,571 --> 02:43:36,711
truth came out and so many people were 
attacking Al Gore immediately 

3616
02:43:36,711 --> 02:43:36,711
afterwards,
boy,

3617
02:43:36,711 --> 02:43:37,830
those conservatives,
they fucking piled on.

3618
02:43:38,250 --> 02:43:40,980
It's almost like they were just trying 
to avoid the information,

3619
02:43:40,981 --> 02:43:45,981
getting out,
just trying to keep business as usual 

3620
02:43:45,981 --> 02:43:48,171
for as long as possible.
I haven't wondered what's the world we 

3621
02:43:48,171 --> 02:43:49,470
currently live in.
If our goal became president.

3622
02:43:49,810 --> 02:43:53,200
Oh,
he should've fucked over that.

3623
02:43:53,201 --> 02:43:55,320
That was one of the weirdest elections 
that were like,

3624
02:43:55,321 --> 02:43:55,620
yeah,
yeah,

3625
02:43:55,621 --> 02:43:56,460
yeah.
We know you won,

3626
02:43:56,461 --> 02:44:00,280
but whatever.
George Bush's second term come out,

3627
02:44:03,170 --> 02:44:05,290
we never get rid of a president in wool.

3628
02:44:05,310 --> 02:44:10,310
Do you always have.
They always get to terms with is John 

3629
02:44:10,310 --> 02:44:10,360
Curry was the second term,
right?

3630
02:44:10,710 --> 02:44:12,430
It was Al Gore was the first one,
right?

3631
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:18,480
Wasn't it a algorithm?
An algorithm running against him the 

3632
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:18,480
first time and then John Kerry did the 
second time.

3633
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:20,340
Was that what it was?
And even John Kerry,

3634
02:44:20,341 --> 02:44:23,610
there was some fuckery,
there was some fuckery when it came to,

3635
02:44:23,670 --> 02:44:24,700
there was,
did you ever.

3636
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:26,310
Well,
it's totally different subject,

3637
02:44:26,311 --> 02:44:31,311
but there was a fantastic hbo 
documentary on called Hacking Democracy 

3638
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:38,000
and it was all about how these diebold 
machines that were created these 

3639
02:44:38,221 --> 02:44:40,800
election counting machines,
we're,

3640
02:44:41,380 --> 02:44:43,850
they were huge contributors to the 
Republican Party,

3641
02:44:43,890 --> 02:44:47,100
the diebold corporation,
which changed her name afterwards,

3642
02:44:47,490 --> 02:44:51,360
but they also,
they engineered some sort of a back door

3643
02:44:51,390 --> 02:44:56,390
into the system,
like clearly there could be hacked and 

3644
02:44:56,390 --> 02:44:57,270
they showed it like without doubt on the
show,

3645
02:44:57,450 --> 02:45:02,450
on the,
in the documentary that you can hack 

3646
02:45:02,450 --> 02:45:04,760
these machines and alter the results.
And these are the machines that they 

3647
02:45:04,760 --> 02:45:07,120
used.
One Swish became president of receipts,

3648
02:45:07,590 --> 02:45:11,310
something.
Then remember the Dang d dangling Chads,

3649
02:45:11,460 --> 02:45:12,060
whoever it was.

3650
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:14,450
It's messed up.
It's missed.

3651
02:45:14,480 --> 02:45:14,890
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3652
02:45:14,900 --> 02:45:15,780
Let's,
um,

3653
02:45:16,070 --> 02:45:18,260
so I mean,
temperatures are rising.

3654
02:45:18,261 --> 02:45:20,420
We notice,
as I said,

3655
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:25,540
worldwide,
I think we're about one point five at 

3656
02:45:25,540 --> 02:45:27,821
the moment,
degrees above preindustrial northern 

3657
02:45:27,821 --> 02:45:28,610
hemisphere to at the moment.
So where are they going?

3658
02:45:28,850 --> 02:45:33,850
Well,
that going towards about six degrees by 

3659
02:45:33,850 --> 02:45:33,850
the end of the century.
Six.

3660
02:45:33,850 --> 02:45:34,580
Yeah,
so you'll talk to people and they'll get

3661
02:45:34,820 --> 02:45:36,300
four point five,
um,

3662
02:45:36,350 --> 02:45:38,060
any climate scientist,
you get this all the time,

3663
02:45:38,061 --> 02:45:41,950
so you to tell me what's going to happen
by the end of the century and they got a

3664
02:45:41,990 --> 02:45:46,990
four point five degrees Celsius 
temperature rise and then you have a 

3665
02:45:46,990 --> 02:45:46,990
drink with them afterwards and they're 
like,

3666
02:45:46,990 --> 02:45:51,020
well I can prove four point five to 99 
point nine,

3667
02:45:51,021 --> 02:45:56,021
nine percent probability,
but I can prove six at 92 percent 

3668
02:45:56,271 --> 02:45:57,630
probability,
you know what I mean?

3669
02:45:57,650 --> 02:46:01,370
And so they don't ever print it because 
they can't be 100 percent certain.

3670
02:46:01,371 --> 02:46:06,371
This is a few more variables.
They need more data that need more 

3671
02:46:06,371 --> 02:46:06,371
research.
They need more calculate.

3672
02:46:06,371 --> 02:46:07,310
That's the real number.
That's actually where it's heading.

3673
02:46:07,311 --> 02:46:09,110
So that's why you get these great 
graphs.

3674
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:10,010
You see this

3675
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:11,450
graph here,
it's a few years old.

3676
02:46:11,451 --> 02:46:11,960
It says,
oh,

3677
02:46:11,961 --> 02:46:13,940
it may only get to one point five 
degrees.

3678
02:46:13,941 --> 02:46:18,941
We were already there.
So the lowest end of this is already 

3679
02:46:18,941 --> 02:46:19,330
happened.
The higher end is,

3680
02:46:19,331 --> 02:46:23,330
is is about six degrees depending on the
different research that you do,

3681
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:28,750
but I think it's just good that people 
realize that scientist won't publish 

3682
02:46:28,750 --> 02:46:32,501
something unless they're 100 percent 
certain on something and so there's a 

3683
02:46:32,501 --> 02:46:32,720
lot of things that they're pretty 
certain on.

3684
02:46:33,020 --> 02:46:38,020
They'll tell you over a drink later on,
but they weren't published it and that 

3685
02:46:38,020 --> 02:46:40,741
generally.
That's why every year it seems to get 

3686
02:46:40,741 --> 02:46:42,851
worse and worse than predictions.
I'm positive proof of global warming is 

3687
02:46:44,470 --> 02:46:47,970
visual visual joke than anything 
[inaudible] I don't think.

3688
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:51,110
I think that people found out.
People look better.

3689
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:53,160
Those little tiny underwear.
This is,

3690
02:46:53,630 --> 02:46:58,630
by the way,
the vast majority of the people that 

3691
02:46:58,630 --> 02:46:59,210
enjoy this show.

3692
02:46:59,720 --> 02:47:03,110
Listen,
I'm trying to talk about it more than 90

3693
02:47:03,111 --> 02:47:04,940
percent so that that picture,
they're like,

3694
02:47:04,941 --> 02:47:08,180
what the fuck did they see?
There's just an old school bloomers from

3695
02:47:08,181 --> 02:47:13,181
the 19 hundreds,
early 19 hundreds to the little tiny 

3696
02:47:13,181 --> 02:47:14,420
bikini underwear that the young ladies 
like to wear today,

3697
02:47:15,450 --> 02:47:18,380
which I support.
That's a global warming is bringing us.

3698
02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:23,370
He Ha fucking fire up.
The higher up the carbon out.

3699
02:47:23,410 --> 02:47:26,750
Skip through this as quickly as I can.
What's going on?

3700
02:47:26,751 --> 02:47:31,751
Why is this all happening while we're 
pumping out non billion tons of carbon 

3701
02:47:31,751 --> 02:47:32,720
dioxide per year.
And the vast,

3702
02:47:32,870 --> 02:47:37,870
what I like about this graph is that you
can see that about three and a half 

3703
02:47:37,870 --> 02:47:42,280
billion tons is actually coming from 
coal and about three and a half from 

3704
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:44,981
petroleum.
So it actually just removing coal from 

3705
02:47:44,981 --> 02:47:46,970
the equation is like a third more than.
That's China is a big one,

3706
02:47:46,971 --> 02:47:47,200
right?

3707
02:47:47,590 --> 02:47:52,590
He's straight.
He's got heaps of coal fire power 

3708
02:47:52,590 --> 02:47:52,880
plants.
Australia will America has some as well,

3709
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:54,590
right?
But China is a,

3710
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:55,940
they have a huge problem with it,
right?

3711
02:47:56,500 --> 02:47:58,580
You need an ancient technology,
uh,

3712
02:47:58,581 --> 02:48:01,100
hundreds of years old.
We got much better stuff these days.

3713
02:48:01,130 --> 02:48:06,130
Okay.
Instead of just going over these graphs 

3714
02:48:06,130 --> 02:48:06,130
and showing how we're fucked,
what can be done?

3715
02:48:06,130 --> 02:48:07,430
Is there something that can be done?
Do you,

3716
02:48:07,490 --> 02:48:10,430
do you have a solution yet?
Adam crop for president of the world.

3717
02:48:11,530 --> 02:48:12,980
I couldn't put up with politicians.
No.

3718
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:14,240
You could put.
Um,

3719
02:48:14,241 --> 02:48:15,110
I,
yeah,

3720
02:48:15,140 --> 02:48:20,140
I have,
I can just skip straightforward to the 

3721
02:48:20,140 --> 02:48:20,140
solutions if you like,
but we have to ride horses or no,

3722
02:48:20,140 --> 02:48:20,140
no,
no,

3723
02:48:20,180 --> 02:48:20,870
I just,
you know,

3724
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:22,910
just want to point out that,
you know,

3725
02:48:22,970 --> 02:48:26,270
different things are going on.
Cyclones or hurricanes are getting worse

3726
02:48:26,271 --> 02:48:28,310
and worse.
The more powerful.

3727
02:48:28,311 --> 02:48:31,580
There's more of them.
Jetstreams messed up.

3728
02:48:31,730 --> 02:48:33,470
Um,
sea level rise.

3729
02:48:33,590 --> 02:48:34,660
Oh,
you know,

3730
02:48:34,670 --> 02:48:38,360
they say maybe two meters,
but once you factor in positive feedback

3731
02:48:38,361 --> 02:48:40,110
loops and stuff like that,
it can be,

3732
02:48:40,340 --> 02:48:43,130
can be significantly higher.
So you come back to the old mold Steve's

3733
02:48:43,131 --> 02:48:43,750
thing,
you know,

3734
02:48:43,810 --> 02:48:44,690
they're,
they're gone.

3735
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:48,380
I'm interesting men.
Do you ever heard of this guy?

3736
02:48:48,740 --> 02:48:50,660
No.
He was the president of the Maldives.

3737
02:48:50,661 --> 02:48:55,661
He was the first democratically elected 
president of 100 percent Muslim country 

3738
02:48:55,661 --> 02:48:58,910
to be like carrots,
like a rabbit out of his teeth.

3739
02:49:02,050 --> 02:49:03,690
He was a marine biologist,
but he's looking at.

3740
02:49:03,691 --> 02:49:05,800
He's biting his lower lip,
like he's a.

3741
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:08,050
is that just a weird face?
They caught him,

3742
02:49:08,780 --> 02:49:12,810
but he spent,
he spent six years in jail and 18 months

3743
02:49:12,811 --> 02:49:14,130
in solitary confinement.
Whoa.

3744
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:19,160
For what?
For going for talking about climate 

3745
02:49:19,160 --> 02:49:19,160
change.
Yes.

3746
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:21,660
It's crazy.
He wanted to beat him in jail.

3747
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:26,960
He's.
He's currently in jail I think at the 

3748
02:49:26,960 --> 02:49:26,960
moment for talking about climate change.
Yeah.

3749
02:49:26,960 --> 02:49:28,800
Wow.
Who put them in jail?

3750
02:49:28,980 --> 02:49:33,120
The next president that came in.
Anyway,

3751
02:49:33,570 --> 02:49:36,840
but so what you have is this huge 
potential sea level when we go,

3752
02:49:36,860 --> 02:49:37,620
oh,
to me does it.

3753
02:49:37,621 --> 02:49:38,460
Most people go,
oh yeah.

3754
02:49:38,461 --> 02:49:43,461
To me to build a wall.
Whatever people in Shanghai would 

3755
02:49:43,461 --> 02:49:43,461
disagree.
But anyway,

3756
02:49:43,461 --> 02:49:45,780
you have the sea level rise potential 
with positive feedback loops.

3757
02:49:45,781 --> 02:49:47,760
So water vapor is probably the most well
understood.

3758
02:49:47,761 --> 02:49:48,510
You know,
more,

3759
02:49:48,540 --> 02:49:49,420
more hotter.

3760
02:49:49,440 --> 02:49:54,440
You have the more water vapor you have 
and that cycles back on itself and it 

3761
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:58,221
gets harder.
Another one is like the permafrost in 

3762
02:49:58,221 --> 02:50:00,951
Siberia and stuff like this.
So as this area thor's it really solid 

3763
02:50:00,951 --> 02:50:04,260
and methane.
Then cycles and it gets more and more 

3764
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:04,260
and more.
So if you take this all into account,

3765
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:08,490
then you get a huge sea level rise of 
about 60 meters is the potential of what

3766
02:50:08,491 --> 02:50:10,760
can go on 16 meters.
No,

3767
02:50:10,761 --> 02:50:12,090
no,
six zero,

3768
02:50:12,091 --> 02:50:13,470
60,
60.

3769
02:50:15,360 --> 02:50:18,120
Convert that defeat at your leisure 
about 200 feet,

3770
02:50:18,480 --> 02:50:21,240
oh my God,
but show a graph.

3771
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:25,290
One thing,
show an image of Australia with 60 meter

3772
02:50:25,291 --> 02:50:26,970
sea level rise,
whereas the states there,

3773
02:50:27,870 --> 02:50:30,030
Florida where it's good,
but get rid of Florida.

3774
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:31,680
California,
let's say,

3775
02:50:31,710 --> 02:50:32,580
has plenty of water.
Now,

3776
02:50:32,610 --> 02:50:37,610
problem solved.
You've got a nice little stuff in the 

3777
02:50:37,610 --> 02:50:37,610
middle.
We a plan in place to live.

3778
02:50:37,610 --> 02:50:41,640
You know stuff in the middle.
There's no one there anyway,

3779
02:50:41,641 --> 02:50:44,790
right now,
most of years gone.

3780
02:50:45,460 --> 02:50:47,100
Good,
good riddance.

3781
02:50:47,430 --> 02:50:50,280
Then you also have the ocean 
acidification.

3782
02:50:50,281 --> 02:50:52,980
Do you know much about that one?
Yes,

3783
02:50:53,090 --> 02:50:58,090
I have read about that.
That's one of the more disturbing 

3784
02:50:58,090 --> 02:50:59,040
aspects of the.
Not just ocean acidification,

3785
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:03,750
but less oxygen and more dead zones.
All the last time this happened,

3786
02:51:03,751 --> 02:51:06,030
which is it's happening and it's only a 
couple of decades away.

3787
02:51:06,180 --> 02:51:09,450
Ninety six percent,
96 percent of the marine species on this

3788
02:51:09,451 --> 02:51:11,160
earth perished.
When was this?

3789
02:51:11,790 --> 02:51:15,630
A 252 million years ago while we bounce 
back.

3790
02:51:16,380 --> 02:51:21,380
We did.
It's called the great dying at the 

3791
02:51:21,380 --> 02:51:22,380
current trends and what's going on.
Two thousand and 50.

3792
02:51:22,680 --> 02:51:25,080
We're looking at this ocean 
acidification event happening,

3793
02:51:25,081 --> 02:51:28,770
so that means that old coral reefs won't
be able to grow carl anymore.

3794
02:51:28,810 --> 02:51:30,690
Uh,
no shellfish can grow shells anymore.

3795
02:51:31,090 --> 02:51:34,320
I'm basically the combined calcium 
carbonate out of the water anymore.

3796
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:39,320
They're basically then the chemistry 
doesn't work anymore and that at the 

3797
02:51:39,320 --> 02:51:42,420
moment is looking at 2050 Jesus.
And that's pretty much,

3798
02:51:42,421 --> 02:51:44,330
that's all your fish species.
Everything that's,

3799
02:51:44,530 --> 02:51:48,120
that's a lot of stuff going.
I saw something online about,

3800
02:51:48,210 --> 02:51:53,210
there was a solution that they were 
proposing where they would put scrap 

3801
02:51:53,210 --> 02:51:58,160
iron all throughout the ocean and then 
that would somehow or another attract 

3802
02:51:58,160 --> 02:52:02,571
algae and that would uh,
basically seeding a whole heap of life 

3803
02:52:02,571 --> 02:52:06,501
to balloon phyto plankton.
And then the base is the start of the 

3804
02:52:06,821 --> 02:52:08,500
food chain.
You're going,

3805
02:52:08,501 --> 02:52:13,501
hey,
here's a whole heap of stuff for you 

3806
02:52:13,501 --> 02:52:13,501
that makes you grow faster and bigger 
and stronger.

3807
02:52:13,501 --> 02:52:15,730
And so it seeds that.
And so yeah,

3808
02:52:15,731 --> 02:52:19,270
it will absorb a large amount of co two 
for sure.

3809
02:52:20,230 --> 02:52:22,260
Not Enough.
It's,

3810
02:52:23,290 --> 02:52:24,180
it's tough.
The,

3811
02:52:24,181 --> 02:52:29,181
the ocean is doing a damn good job at 
the moment of absorbing a lot of CEO 

3812
02:52:29,181 --> 02:52:29,181
two.

3813
02:52:29,181 --> 02:52:33,030
And that's why we have this kind of 40 
year lag thing going on because the 

3814
02:52:33,030 --> 02:52:33,040
ocean absorbs a lot of heat and it's a 
heat sink,

3815
02:52:33,070 --> 02:52:34,690
you know,
but I mean,

3816
02:52:34,691 --> 02:52:36,190
this one here,
this is from,

3817
02:52:36,520 --> 02:52:41,520
this is this month,
and you've got 12 degrees warmer in the 

3818
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:41,980
top.
It's crazy.

3819
02:52:41,981 --> 02:52:46,981
And Yeah,
about 12 degrees warmer than standard 

3820
02:52:46,981 --> 02:52:51,420
than normal arctic.
The Arctic basically didn't have a 

3821
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:51,420
winter this year.
It's just stayed.

3822
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:55,190
Some stayed summer or kind of warm.
Twelve degrees Celsius warmer than 

3823
02:52:55,190 --> 02:52:56,350
usual.
Whoa.

3824
02:52:56,560 --> 02:53:01,560
Yeah.
So that whole optic ice free sort of 

3825
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:03,220
thing that's not too far away.
It's actually not too far away.

3826
02:53:03,480 --> 02:53:06,070
It's closer than you think in Greenland 
is thawing very,

3827
02:53:06,071 --> 02:53:07,840
very fast.
I mean if you look at the melts,

3828
02:53:08,290 --> 02:53:10,930
uh,
over 50 percent of greenland melted last

3829
02:53:10,930 --> 02:53:12,790
year.
Most of it refroze thank God,

3830
02:53:12,791 --> 02:53:15,520
but it,
it's melting over 50 percent.

3831
02:53:15,640 --> 02:53:20,640
Yeah.
As a graph in front of your 2015 mil 

3832
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:20,800
percentage was over 50 percent of it 
melted.

3833
02:53:21,560 --> 02:53:25,000
I'm normally just over about 20 percent 
melts per year,

3834
02:53:25,060 --> 02:53:28,990
but a large portion of melted was 
greenland at one point in time.

3835
02:53:28,991 --> 02:53:31,930
Green is that with the reason why they 
called the Greenland?

3836
02:53:31,980 --> 02:53:34,360
Just messed up the naming because 
Iceland,

3837
02:53:36,070 --> 02:53:37,900
I know Iceland and Greenland should be 
the other way around,

3838
02:53:37,930 --> 02:53:39,970
but aura.
But I'm going there for the first time.

3839
02:53:39,971 --> 02:53:43,480
Actually in June.
Go on a national geographic explorer.

3840
02:53:43,481 --> 02:53:45,400
I'm doing svalbard,
Iceland,

3841
02:53:45,401 --> 02:53:47,290
Greenland.
Super excited.

3842
02:53:47,291 --> 02:53:50,740
So again,
I love these charts and graphs,

3843
02:53:50,741 --> 02:53:52,300
but we're almost out of time here.
Where we're at.

3844
02:53:52,301 --> 02:53:53,470
Three minutes.
What can we do?

3845
02:53:53,770 --> 02:53:54,250
Well,
yeah.

3846
02:53:54,251 --> 02:53:55,990
What can we do?
Um,

3847
02:53:57,630 --> 02:54:00,580
you need to save the children.
But I prefer save the animals.

3848
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:02,900
So that's what you like.
The animals one,

3849
02:54:02,930 --> 02:54:03,810
the people.
What?

3850
02:54:04,420 --> 02:54:05,350
I'm scared of.
Toddlers,

3851
02:54:05,351 --> 02:54:07,480
they kill more people than terrorists.
I'm scared of them.

3852
02:54:07,810 --> 02:54:12,810
Toddlers do.
Toddlers in the states kill more people 

3853
02:54:12,810 --> 02:54:12,810
in terrorists.
Um,

3854
02:54:12,810 --> 02:54:13,450
how do they kill people?
Shoot them.

3855
02:54:13,451 --> 02:54:15,580
Generally know those guns are killing 
people,

3856
02:54:15,581 --> 02:54:16,630
not toddlers.
Right?

3857
02:54:19,150 --> 02:54:21,550
Well,
just keep the fucking guns away from the

3858
02:54:21,551 --> 02:54:25,480
tolerance and don't kill anybody.
How many people get killed by toddlers?

3859
02:54:26,110 --> 02:54:27,460
It's a lot.
It's crazy.

3860
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:29,500
Really?
Toddlers with guns.

3861
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:31,330
Website.
I should be a new band.

3862
02:54:31,331 --> 02:54:33,400
Jamey.
Thinking about a band name.

3863
02:54:33,490 --> 02:54:35,190
Toddlers with guns.
Toddler.

3864
02:54:35,250 --> 02:54:36,370
Yes,
death by toddler,

3865
02:54:36,610 --> 02:54:38,770
there is a million different things you 
can do with climate change.

3866
02:54:38,771 --> 02:54:40,720
There is the thing that most people do 
is,

3867
02:54:40,840 --> 02:54:42,040
oh,
here's a great idea.

3868
02:54:42,041 --> 02:54:43,240
We need to do that one idea.
No,

3869
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:48,300
we need to do all of them.
We need to do them all now and we need 

3870
02:54:48,300 --> 02:54:50,740
to do them all 20 years ago basically.
That's why I keep saying really have you

3871
02:54:50,741 --> 02:54:55,741
tried turning it on and off again?
Like we kind of do need to kind of do a 

3872
02:54:55,741 --> 02:54:56,500
full reset,
but we need to start.

3873
02:54:56,530 --> 02:55:01,530
We have the technology to get to do all 
these things and keep living standards 

3874
02:55:01,530 --> 02:55:01,930
out.
We have the technology,

3875
02:55:01,931 --> 02:55:04,100
we just need to start acting on it.
Whether

3876
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:06,320
it be hyperloop,
hyperloop is a great idea.

3877
02:55:06,321 --> 02:55:07,600
Why aren't we doing that?
Um,

3878
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:10,550
and the big thing that always comes to 
me,

3879
02:55:10,551 --> 02:55:12,410
you know,
put solar panels on your roof.

3880
02:55:12,700 --> 02:55:14,990
Efficiency is a huge one.
Change to led,

3881
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:16,730
led bulbs,
all that sort of stuff.

3882
02:55:16,790 --> 02:55:21,790
There's a million different things and 
we've gone over this a million times as 

3883
02:55:21,790 --> 02:55:21,790
well,
but always comes down to money.

3884
02:55:21,790 --> 02:55:24,110
And I always say there's lots of money 
out there to be done.

3885
02:55:24,200 --> 02:55:26,990
There's lots of money to be used and 
where you can raise taxes,

3886
02:55:26,991 --> 02:55:28,340
carbon taxes,
a great way,

3887
02:55:28,430 --> 02:55:29,960
very efficient,
been proven over and over.

3888
02:55:29,961 --> 02:55:32,150
It's a great way to actually curb 
climate change.

3889
02:55:32,630 --> 02:55:35,480
You could just print the money like the 
bankster that always works.

3890
02:55:37,400 --> 02:55:39,290
You could,
I'm going to get in a lot of trouble for

3891
02:55:39,291 --> 02:55:44,291
this,
but you could take a little bit of the 

3892
02:55:44,291 --> 02:55:47,441
war budget,
that military budget and how you're 

3893
02:55:47,441 --> 02:55:47,441
going to get in trouble for that.

3894
02:55:47,441 --> 02:55:49,040
That's really amazed.
I do climate change talks among moment.

3895
02:55:49,041 --> 02:55:54,041
I talk about reducing military budgets 
and putting it towards good climate 

3896
02:55:54,041 --> 02:55:55,130
change.
That sort of freedom.

3897
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:57,260
My posing.
I love team American.

3898
02:55:57,261 --> 02:55:58,270
That's a great man.
Um,

3899
02:55:58,850 --> 02:56:02,060
so I mean I actually did,
I started a nonprofit,

3900
02:56:02,061 --> 02:56:04,490
but it's more of an idea at the moment 
called world without war.

3901
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:09,520
And that was all about hey,
let's take 50 percent of the military 

3902
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:12,461
budgets and put it towards large 
infrastructure projects are planting 

3903
02:56:12,461 --> 02:56:12,890
trees,
build a hyperloop.

3904
02:56:12,950 --> 02:56:14,720
And once you do the figures,
like once you have,

3905
02:56:14,750 --> 02:56:16,010
oh,
I've got $2,000,000,000,000,

3906
02:56:16,011 --> 02:56:18,620
what can I do for $2,000,000,000,000?
You'd be amazed.

3907
02:56:18,621 --> 02:56:20,120
You can give free education for 
everyone.

3908
02:56:20,121 --> 02:56:24,500
You can convert all those coal fire 
power plants into renewables.

3909
02:56:24,501 --> 02:56:29,501
You can completely reduce deforestation,
you can do zero website world without 

3910
02:56:29,501 --> 02:56:31,010
or.org.
I said it's just an idea.

3911
02:56:31,070 --> 02:56:32,550
Just started.
Um,

3912
02:56:32,660 --> 02:56:37,660
but that's the last one I'd like to end 
on because I know we're running out of 

3913
02:56:37,660 --> 02:56:39,560
time is buckminster fuller and I think 
he put it best,

3914
02:56:39,590 --> 02:56:42,920
which is it is now highly,
highly feasible to take care of everyone

3915
02:56:42,921 --> 02:56:46,070
on earth at a higher standard of living 
than any have ever known.

3916
02:56:46,220 --> 02:56:49,670
It no longer has to be you and me.
Selfishness is unnecessary.

3917
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:54,940
War is obsolete.
It's a matter of converting the high 

3918
02:56:54,940 --> 02:56:54,950
technology from weaponry to luminary.

3919
02:56:56,930 --> 02:56:59,090
That's a beautiful quote.
But how do you,

3920
02:56:59,270 --> 02:57:01,970
how do you deal with Isis?
How do you deal with Isis?

3921
02:57:03,050 --> 02:57:04,070
Once again,
I'll get in trouble.

3922
02:57:04,250 --> 02:57:04,700
Don't,
ah,

3923
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,930
don't build isis in the first place.
Don't give them over weapons.

3924
02:57:08,470 --> 02:57:09,550
But once you,
uh,

3925
02:57:09,590 --> 02:57:12,080
once you do have them with all the 
weapons,

3926
02:57:12,081 --> 02:57:17,081
what is this?
People getting shot by toddlers on a 

3927
02:57:17,081 --> 02:57:17,081
weekly basis this year.
It's real.

3928
02:57:17,420 --> 02:57:21,860
Oh my fucking God.
More Americans who are two year olds are

3929
02:57:21,861 --> 02:57:23,420
shooting people.
Yeah.

3930
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:25,270
What the fuck?
Or in October,

3931
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:27,660
2015,
it said 43 instances.

3932
02:57:27,860 --> 02:57:28,770
What?
Yeah.

3933
02:57:29,180 --> 02:57:30,470
Oh my God.
This is insane.

3934
02:57:30,620 --> 02:57:34,250
In 2015,
at least 13 toddlers have been,

3935
02:57:34,390 --> 02:57:37,070
have inadvertently killed themselves 
with firearms.

3936
02:57:37,071 --> 02:57:42,071
18 more injured themselves.
10 injured other people and two killed 

3937
02:57:42,071 --> 02:57:45,190
other people.
So I'm still at children.

3938
02:57:45,950 --> 02:57:46,610
Well,
we're just,

3939
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:51,640
it's not the kids.
It's people that leave the fucking guns 

3940
02:57:51,640 --> 02:57:52,900
around kids.
That's what it says.

3941
02:57:52,910 --> 02:57:54,140
You didn't Australia,
we have no guns.

3942
02:57:54,260 --> 02:57:58,120
Yeah,
we had the largest massacre on earth.

3943
02:57:58,180 --> 02:58:01,050
I'm 36 people or something got killed 
and we just tend to run.

3944
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:01,590
Went,
eh.

3945
02:58:01,591 --> 02:58:01,950
You know what

3946
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:05,940
we don't against worked rather well we 
did for you guys.

3947
02:58:05,941 --> 02:58:10,941
But again,
you have the population of Los Angeles 

3948
02:58:10,941 --> 02:58:11,760
and in China and Hong Kong land.
Yeah.

3949
02:58:11,770 --> 02:58:14,760
There's,
there's something like a certain.

3950
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:18,600
I think there's hundreds of millions of 
guns in America.

3951
02:58:18,601 --> 02:58:23,601
I think there's as many guns as there 
are people and there are trillions of 

3952
02:58:23,601 --> 02:58:28,251
rounds of ammunition and the gun people 
say if there was really a gun problem,

3953
02:58:28,590 --> 02:58:33,590
you know,
it would all our guns and all our ammo 

3954
02:58:33,590 --> 02:58:37,890
through is really a gun problem.
I fucking just reasonably suggested,

3955
02:58:37,950 --> 02:58:42,950
reasonably suggested that people that 
are mentally unbalanced maybe shouldn't 

3956
02:58:42,950 --> 02:58:47,571
have guns and people and the fucking 
hate from the far right,

3957
02:58:49,270 --> 02:58:54,270
but like the people that really believe 
in the second amendment says though,

3958
02:58:54,971 --> 02:58:59,430
right,
it's a right to keep and bear not but no

3959
02:58:59,431 --> 02:59:01,770
buts.
I believe in the second amendment,

3960
02:59:01,860 --> 02:59:02,960
but no,
no,

3961
02:59:02,970 --> 02:59:03,930
no,
no buts,

3962
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:05,730
no buts.
Guns.

3963
02:59:05,760 --> 02:59:08,370
Isn't it like a well armed militias and 
stop government?

3964
02:59:08,670 --> 02:59:09,660
Yeah,
that's what's supposed to be.

3965
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:10,620
Well,
that's what they think.

3966
02:59:10,621 --> 02:59:15,621
Like those,
the Oregon people who we never figured 

3967
02:59:15,621 --> 02:59:17,940
out who first dubbed them.
Y'All kinda whoever that guy is,

3968
02:59:18,030 --> 02:59:22,710
Kudos to you or her ma'am or sir,
it's great.

3969
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:24,060
Great Name.
But uh,

3970
02:59:24,210 --> 02:59:25,020
yeah,
those people,

3971
02:59:25,021 --> 02:59:26,930
there's a lot of people like that that 
think will,

3972
02:59:26,940 --> 02:59:28,680
they're coming for our guns.

3973
02:59:30,900 --> 02:59:32,190
It's education.

3974
02:59:32,330 --> 02:59:33,830
When it comes down to it,
the best thing,

3975
02:59:33,860 --> 02:59:36,860
money for dollar for dollar that you can
do is education.

3976
02:59:37,460 --> 02:59:42,460
If you educate women in the world that 
have less children and that that solves 

3977
02:59:42,460 --> 02:59:42,460
a lot of problems right there to the 
truth.

3978
02:59:42,690 --> 02:59:47,690
I'm the only other thing.
Dollar for dollar education is the best 

3979
02:59:47,690 --> 02:59:50,930
way and especially educating women and 
in third world countries especially,

3980
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:55,960
but that was the way 20 years ago I feel
now we've gotten to the point where we 

3981
02:59:56,151 --> 02:59:57,700
really.
I said 40 year lag,

3982
02:59:57,770 --> 03:00:00,800
so what's happening now?
We're not going to see for 40 years.

3983
03:00:01,130 --> 03:00:06,130
We need to do something major.
We need to do something right now and 

3984
03:00:06,130 --> 03:00:08,921
that's why I quite like the world 
without war thing because for every 

3985
03:00:08,921 --> 03:00:10,340
dollar you spend lobbying to get people 
to reduce their military budget,

3986
03:00:10,580 --> 03:00:15,580
you multiply,
you're going to get a lot more money 

3987
03:00:15,580 --> 03:00:15,580
diverted to something that

3988
03:00:15,580 --> 03:00:18,470
is better for society basically.

3989
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:23,630
I mean that's whether it's 
infrastructure or hyperloop or plant 

3990
03:00:23,630 --> 03:00:23,630
trees or get electric cars,
whatever,

3991
03:00:23,630 --> 03:00:24,150
throw the money at it.

3992
03:00:24,390 --> 03:00:29,390
Well,
very few people would argue with you 

3993
03:00:29,390 --> 03:00:29,390
that the world would be better off 
without war.

3994
03:00:29,390 --> 03:00:31,350
I think the real argument,
everyone argues with me on that one,

3995
03:00:31,530 --> 03:00:36,530
I think the real argument would be 
whether or not the rest of the world 

3996
03:00:36,530 --> 03:00:36,810
would cooperate.
Like we all would agree.

3997
03:00:36,960 --> 03:00:41,370
Let's just like ramp down our gun 
production or missile production.

3998
03:00:41,550 --> 03:00:45,960
Let's ramp it down and everybody relaxed
and let's reallocate those resources.

3999
03:00:46,230 --> 03:00:48,060
Most people would say that'd be a great 
idea,

4000
03:00:48,061 --> 03:00:51,300
but who's going to do it as well?
You know?

4001
03:00:51,380 --> 03:00:53,540
Is Isis going to do it?
I like these example

4002
03:00:53,580 --> 03:00:58,580
of Indian Pakistan,
India and Pakistan keep raising the 

4003
03:00:58,580 --> 03:01:01,221
military budgets every year to compete 
with each other because they want to 

4004
03:01:01,221 --> 03:01:01,221
make sure that we're spending

4005
03:01:01,221 --> 03:01:01,570
the same amount as the other guy because
this guy,

4006
03:01:01,571 --> 03:01:06,571
the other guy,
you go to these two countries and you 

4007
03:01:06,571 --> 03:01:06,571
go,
Hey,

4008
03:01:06,571 --> 03:01:07,000
here's a treaty.
Just like all the trade agreements,

4009
03:01:07,001 --> 03:01:12,001
whatever that you sign and you reduce 
the military budget by 50 percent and 

4010
03:01:12,001 --> 03:01:15,541
the other guy promises to do it as well.
Suddenly you're reducing war which are 

4011
03:01:15,541 --> 03:01:19,991
more for.
And you're also helping a relieving a 

4012
03:01:19,991 --> 03:01:20,140
heap of money available for Climate 
Change Abatement.

4013
03:01:20,590 --> 03:01:24,610
So I think it's a win win situation,
but all my Lord I get in trouble.

4014
03:01:24,611 --> 03:01:26,990
We're not talking about.
Well you signed your hippie.

4015
03:01:27,450 --> 03:01:29,740
Got Idealistic Hippie.
That's what the problem is.

4016
03:01:29,770 --> 03:01:30,920
The people right now are,
yeah,

4017
03:01:31,060 --> 03:01:33,730
fuck this hippie shutting their iphone 
off right now.

4018
03:01:33,790 --> 03:01:36,560
Fucking hippie.
I hate when Rogan as hippies on.

4019
03:01:37,530 --> 03:01:40,060
But who wants war man?
Nobody wants war.

4020
03:01:40,150 --> 03:01:41,410
So maybe Jocko.
Jocko.

4021
03:01:41,411 --> 03:01:43,870
My aunt is it.
Most people don't want it,

4022
03:01:44,140 --> 03:01:45,300
you know,
they date,

4023
03:01:45,500 --> 03:01:48,400
you know,
they reluctantly accept the fact that we

4024
03:01:48,401 --> 03:01:53,401
have disputes and then we have a armies 
to handle that and keep us safe.

4025
03:01:54,690 --> 03:01:59,690
But if you ask them,
would it be better if we just took that 

4026
03:01:59,690 --> 03:02:03,181
money?
And instead of like having all this 

4027
03:02:03,181 --> 03:02:03,181
military spending on climate change.
Yeah.

4028
03:02:03,181 --> 03:02:05,320
But then there's also those people that 
are in the military that don't have jobs

4029
03:02:05,321 --> 03:02:07,510
anymore.
Like you know how many soldiers,

4030
03:02:07,511 --> 03:02:12,511
like we have less soldiers.
I'm sure we can get jobs for them that 

4031
03:02:12,511 --> 03:02:13,450
don't involve killing people with as 
many different ways to do this.

4032
03:02:13,990 --> 03:02:16,120
You can.
This is all very reasonable.

4033
03:02:16,150 --> 03:02:17,250
I just don't know.
Yeah,

4034
03:02:17,280 --> 03:02:18,250
no.
I said,

4035
03:02:18,270 --> 03:02:21,430
I'm amazed at how much kickback I get 
from that one thing,

4036
03:02:21,450 --> 03:02:23,410
but I normally don't mention it.
I don't mean to make climate change.

4037
03:02:23,411 --> 03:02:25,060
I don't want to convolute it with 
something like that.

4038
03:02:25,900 --> 03:02:30,900
It's such a perfect idea.
A perfect idea is in that console a lot 

4039
03:02:31,421 --> 03:02:36,421
of problems and at the timeframe that we
need to solve them because everything 

4040
03:02:36,421 --> 03:02:36,421
else,
if you look at the climate,

4041
03:02:36,460 --> 03:02:37,390
Paris talks,
right?

4042
03:02:37,540 --> 03:02:42,540
Cop Twenty one,
so the first time they got together 

4043
03:02:42,540 --> 03:02:42,540
talking about climate science,
they eventually went,

4044
03:02:42,540 --> 03:02:43,000
okay,
195 countries.

4045
03:02:43,001 --> 03:02:46,960
We agree something's gone wrong and we 
need to prevent the earth and warming to

4046
03:02:46,990 --> 03:02:49,630
two degrees Celsius.
Well,

4047
03:02:50,440 --> 03:02:52,630
six months later we're already there,
you know,

4048
03:02:52,660 --> 03:02:53,860
so and,
and they,

4049
03:02:53,870 --> 03:02:56,140
they're not agreeing to do anything for 
five years as well,

4050
03:02:56,260 --> 03:02:57,880
so they don't even start to do anything 
five years.

4051
03:02:57,881 --> 03:03:00,580
Like if we wait for politicians to do 
something about this,

4052
03:03:00,620 --> 03:03:02,490
we're so screwed.
We really are.

4053
03:03:02,680 --> 03:03:07,680
Well,
that's one of the problems with having 

4054
03:03:07,680 --> 03:03:08,920
politicians is that they're not experts.
They're not experts in anything.

4055
03:03:08,950 --> 03:03:11,710
They're experts in figuring out how to 
get people to vote for him.

4056
03:03:11,770 --> 03:03:13,720
That's it.
Most politicians,

4057
03:03:13,780 --> 03:03:18,780
they're not the best at anything.
They're certainly not like exemplary 

4058
03:03:19,301 --> 03:03:22,990
human beings who are beyond reproach.
The good egg,

4059
03:03:23,330 --> 03:03:24,440
you know,
they're good at debate,

4060
03:03:24,441 --> 03:03:29,441
so like other than Bernie Sanders,
I mean Bernie Sanders seems to be a 

4061
03:03:29,441 --> 03:03:31,690
pretty exemplary guy.
Believe or not believe in socialism.

4062
03:03:31,691 --> 03:03:36,691
Argue it as you may.
He seems like a great guy with some 

4063
03:03:36,691 --> 03:03:38,500
pretty good ideas about the world,
but we're at a time,

4064
03:03:38,920 --> 03:03:39,760
one at a time.
Adam.

4065
03:03:39,970 --> 03:03:43,570
Got to see how quickly that guys is.
Three hours and 15 minutes,

4066
03:03:43,571 --> 03:03:45,040
man.
Right about that.

4067
03:03:45,190 --> 03:03:47,290
Something like that were over.
We went over.

4068
03:03:47,980 --> 03:03:50,590
We don't give a fuck over here.
Thank you very much.

4069
03:03:50,591 --> 03:03:52,930
So let's do this again man.
How often are you in la?

4070
03:03:54,100 --> 03:03:55,210
I have no idea,
but hey,

4071
03:03:55,390 --> 03:03:57,500
I'll come back next year.
You're all over the place,

4072
03:03:57,501 --> 03:03:57,980
man.

4073
03:03:58,940 --> 03:04:00,290
Come,
come around and come visit us,

4074
03:04:00,291 --> 03:04:02,000
but thank you very much.
Really appreciate it.

4075
03:04:02,300 --> 03:04:05,100
It's been a great pleasure and hey,
keep up the good work chart.

4076
03:04:05,170 --> 03:04:07,320
You are really doing some amazing stuff 
here.

4077
03:04:07,530 --> 03:04:12,530
I don't think people tell you that 
enough that we're listing all the way 

4078
03:04:12,530 --> 03:04:12,530
back in Australia and we're loving what 
you're doing.

4079
03:04:12,530 --> 03:04:13,040
Thank you brother.
I really appreciate that.

4080
03:04:13,240 --> 03:04:14,330
All right.
Thank you friends.

4081
03:04:14,570 --> 03:04:16,280
That's it for this week.
You fuckers.

4082
03:04:16,310 --> 03:04:17,180
I'll see you soon.
Bye.

4083
03:04:17,181 --> 03:04:17,900
Bye.
Big Kiss.
