1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,893
Hello

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,000
stitches,

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,781
you know,

4
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:04,531
it's a process.

5
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:04,711
We're,

6
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:05,850
we're all a part of this process.

7
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,091
We,

8
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:08,280
you and I have both
seen each other evolve.

9
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,280
We just don't really realize it as
much because we evolve together.

10
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:11,520
Right.

11
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,060
But if we went back in time 10 years
ago to when we met and then like when we

12
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:15,540
meet,

13
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,460
we'll use it.

14
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,120
It was about 10 years ago.

15
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:19,260
A little over that I think.

16
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:19,501
Really?

17
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:19,711
Yeah.

18
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,520
I might've been like 2001
or something like that.

19
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,590
What's it like even before that dude?

20
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,841
Yeah.

21
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,500
I knew you not allowed Joe.

22
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,030
I bet.

23
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,260
I bet you don't remember this.

24
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,030
I remember the first time that you really,

25
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,451
yes,

26
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:30,901
I was,

27
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:31,650
this was when I was,

28
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:31,980
uh,

29
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,550
Cory's assistant at the
comedy store and we,

30
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:37,080
I was sitting next to you.

31
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,273
Um,

32
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,240
and you are,

33
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,073
I think you had,

34
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,190
this was right around when you just
started smoking weed or you'd become,

35
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,621
you are more,

36
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:47,160
you are kind of a marijuana starting
to become a marijuana advocate at this

37
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:47,790
time.

38
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,421
But it wasn't,

39
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,130
this is what's called my annoying phase.

40
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,501
No,

41
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,600
but it was really funny.

42
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,050
It.

43
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,230
Yeah,

44
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,220
it was an annoying thing.

45
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,880
It was really funny
cause I was sitting man.

46
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,160
No I was sitting next to you
and I at the time I had been,

47
00:00:59,190 --> 00:00:59,730
I got,

48
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,730
I went through this being
a marijuana advocate phase,

49
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:03,740
like you know a few,

50
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:04,770
a few years before.

51
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,280
But remember sitting nice and you were
talking about weed and as a joke cause I

52
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:08,941
didn't know you that well.

53
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:13,650
He didn't know me and as a dumb joke I
was like man we should be illegal and you

54
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,960
shot me this fucking look man you are,

55
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,620
you are like sure

56
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,290
make an accident.

57
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,790
As you thought how it you gotta
put some fake dress up on his head.

58
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,320
He was all Gary Oldman.

59
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:23,170
Him Mom,

60
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,331
you seem to know.

61
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,164
I said it should be okay.

62
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,420
You Eagle and you seem so pissed.

63
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,460
And then Cory like was like to shut up,

64
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:29,941
shut up.

65
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,090
Don't say anything because you,

66
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,470
we didn't know each other and I could
have seem like a real asshole at the time.

67
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,340
But then,

68
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,600
then I don't remember that at all.

69
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,051
I know.

70
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,700
I think you might just
be a little paranoid.

71
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,720
I think he tuned me out.

72
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,823
I probably would.

73
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,330
I don't think I would cut it like,

74
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:42,750
like,

75
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,550
like got angry with you
and you don't get angry.

76
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:47,030
I pride flooring dare you?

77
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,720
Yeah.

78
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,640
Well I was making it

79
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,151
one of two things.

80
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,260
Either you were trying to make a joke,

81
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:55,760
which would be not funny and I would
be bored with it or I'd be like,

82
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:56,780
what an asshole.

83
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,101
Oh,

84
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:57,330
just,

85
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,350
I think it was the fall.

86
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,260
It was the former.

87
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,860
And then after that we started talking
on the phone and we start having

88
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:03,640
conversations

89
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,090
this on the phone we've been at Duncan
and I used to have these fucking 45

90
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:09,760
minute phone calls where a
call him up cause Dunkin was,

91
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:09,881
uh,

92
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:10,990
the dude who like you'd say,

93
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:11,231
Hey,

94
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,600
I can work a Tuesday through
Thursday of this week and go,

95
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:13,871
okay,

96
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:14,081
cool.

97
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:14,710
And then he would,

98
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,891
you know,

99
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,210
they'd get together and create a schedule.

100
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,620
You'd call it Dunkin would,

101
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:17,860
uh,

102
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,610
get your avail.

103
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,650
So me and Dunkin just
started talking on the phone.

104
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:21,850
I don't know what started it off.

105
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,980
We'd have these crazy ass

106
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,200
45 minute fucking while he's working at
the comedy store and every now and be

107
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:28,350
like,

108
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,531
oh,

109
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,251
hold on a second dude,

110
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:30,084
sorry.

111
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,120
He put me on hold and have to
answer some other phone call.

112
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:37,500
And so got to lay in your bed with
your little swatch phone baked as fuck.

113
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,060
Donald was high on the job.

114
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,640
Every god Damn Day work there,

115
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,570
right?

116
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,470
There's all kinds of,

117
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:42,741
yeah,

118
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:42,871
it's,

119
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,641
it sucks man.

120
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,210
People,

121
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,450
the brain is an organ
and it malfunctions and,

122
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,300
and sometimes you go nuts and that's,

123
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:52,130
and you get stigmatized for it,

124
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,230
which really sucks because if you like,

125
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,000
because that just adds to the problem.

126
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,020
Like if you,

127
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,770
you know,

128
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,430
you see somebody in a
cast and you're like,

129
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,701
oh,

130
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:01,481
what happened to your arm?

131
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,081
And they'll tell you,

132
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,291
oh,

133
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:02,531
you know,

134
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:02,861
whatever.

135
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,694
I fell down.

136
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,290
But you,

137
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,070
you talked to someone who's
been hospitalized for a
few weeks and they tell you

138
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:10,060
I had to go to the hospital.

139
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:11,110
I had a nervous breakdown.

140
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:12,100
I went crazy shit.

141
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,440
My pants through my dog through a window.

142
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,423
You're like,

143
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,470
you're like,

144
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,081
you know you,

145
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:18,551
you'll want,

146
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,510
you want to be compassionate,

147
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:20,650
but there's some part of you that's like,

148
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,460
oh,

149
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,050
now this is a crazy person.

150
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,240
It's like it's just something happened.

151
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,800
The operating system temporarily crashed
and quite often I think that could be a

152
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,730
very good thing.

153
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,500
I think that having your,

154
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,620
your personality or your ego or crash
can often mean that you were trying to be

155
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:43,480
somebody that you aren't and some
people invest so much energy,

156
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,510
so much energy into trying to find me.

157
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,941
Yeah.

158
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:47,440
They just want to be some thing.

159
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:47,741
You know,

160
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:47,901
they,

161
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:48,491
they it,

162
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,510
since there were a kid there,

163
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,440
mother was telling them,

164
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:53,920
you should be like this and then they
try to be like this and they hold up this

165
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:54,670
thing.

166
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,670
They're always working to hold up this
giant tail feather in their arms start

167
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,570
shaking and that they can't hold it up
and that's when they have like anger

168
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:07,360
outbursts are suddenly like
their friends are like you.

169
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,010
You turned into someone
that I've never met.

170
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,120
I don't even know who that is.

171
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,601
It's like,

172
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:11,290
no,

173
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,011
that is,

174
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:12,940
you met them,

175
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:15,010
you met underneath the tail feather,

176
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,120
the seeding,

177
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:20,230
see anger and disappointment and sadness.

178
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,370
They that you met,

179
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:22,410
that thing that they're,

180
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,360
they're trying to avoid by
looking up at this mask.

181
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,190
They're holding up to the world,

182
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,810
but that fucking saving,

183
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,070
see of disappointment,

184
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,380
anger and horror and sadness.

185
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,820
That's where it's at,

186
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:34,330
man.

187
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,010
You got to go into that thing and it's,

188
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:36,731
for some people,

189
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:40,540
the only way they can go into that is
by having a full scale nervous breakdown

190
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,420
because then they can have
permission to dive into that,

191
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,450
into that awful vortex of darkness because
underneath that vortex of darkness is

192
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:49,714
paradise.

193
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,553
Underneath that,

194
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,720
that's love and happiness and joy and
connection and tranquility and all that

195
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,320
stuff and everyone's thinks that the
way to get to that point is by avoiding

196
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,000
this awful black forest that
surrounds the garden of Eden,

197
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,320
which is inside everybody.

198
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,370
It's inside everybody.

199
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,353
It's there,

200
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,860
it's there and it doesn't matter.

201
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,000
You know you can work out and that
will definitely give you a temporarily

202
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,710
temporary good feeling,

203
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,610
but until you address the internal
structures that you haven't acknowledged,

204
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,020
you're always going to go back to that
place where you find yourself morose and

205
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:24,820
depressed and angry,

206
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,050
and you don't know why.

207
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,880
You always go back to that place until
you sit with the sadness inside of you.

208
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:31,780
You have to do that.

209
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,970
What you're describing is
coming out of the closet.

210
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,500
Yeah.

211
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,251
For a lot of people,

212
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,001
that is what it is,

213
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:37,391
man.

214
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:40,160
It's coming out of the closet
and there's a lot of closets,

215
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,690
man.

216
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,280
There's not just the gay closet,

217
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:42,490
right?

218
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,720
There's all kinds of closet.

219
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:45,040
There's the artists closet.

220
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,840
Some people are fucking accountants.

221
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,920
They're wearing suits and their ties on
tight and they're fucking like organized

222
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,730
and disciplined,

223
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,740
but inside they're probably painters.

224
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,540
They probably want it fucking paint.

225
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,240
They want to paint day
mountains down at the beach.

226
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,260
That's what they really are,

227
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,530
but their daddy or their mommy wanted
them to be a good little businessman,

228
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,710
so they became this thing that's
the opposite of what they are.

229
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,450
This is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita.

230
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:08,901
God,

231
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,730
forgive me cause I've quoted
it way too many times,

232
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:11,240
but it's,

233
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,740
it's better to be an honest street
sweeper than a dishonest king.

234
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,980
It's better to be a happy guy brushing
fucking leafs up the street than it is to

235
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:26,180
be some zillionaire who inside
is dying or numb or miserable,

236
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,014
mostly numb,

237
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,011
numbs the word.

238
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,270
Most people are just not.

239
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:32,180
As long as these people
can quantify on paper,

240
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:34,520
I still have a x million dollar home.

241
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:38,600
My car still cost x thousand
dollars this suit is an ex suit.

242
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,950
I am still ahead.

243
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,350
I am not going to abandon
all of these things.

244
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,230
As long as they don't see
through the bullshit of the game.

245
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,130
They think they're winning.

246
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,290
They have to file.

247
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,750
It's almost like you have
to fall to to really,

248
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,130
that's what you got to appreciate those
moments when it all falls apart on you

249
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,440
because that means you've got
an opportunity to try it again.

250
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:57,930
This is,

251
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,870
let's take a new fresh perspective.

252
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,970
This is the cool thing that
at this retreat I went to
this Guy Jack Cornfield's

253
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:04,131
out,

254
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:04,960
which I really loved.

255
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,870
[inaudible] great name by the way.

256
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,410
Yeah.

257
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,243
With a k,

258
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,021
not a c,

259
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:08,870
Jack Kornfield,

260
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:09,770
mortal Kombat,

261
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,630
k Jack Cornfield.

262
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,261
But he,

263
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:12,440
uh,

264
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,580
he's really cool man.

265
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,140
But he was cool.

266
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,990
He's a cat,

267
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,010
like the cigarette corny.

268
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,400
Now this guy was awesome and he was one
of the things he talked about his in

269
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,260
some religious tradition,

270
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,040
how they like hold the scriptures a
rabbi like had his students hold the

271
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,680
scriptures over their heart and uh,

272
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,650
when they were memorizing
them and they would say,

273
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:34,460
why do we do this?

274
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,821
And he said,

275
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,990
so that when your heartbreaks,

276
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:36,890
they'll fall in.

277
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,780
And it's a beautiful idea,

278
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:42,260
which is that heartbreak is
actually your ego cracking.

279
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,030
And the moment that cracks,

280
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,830
you're in the experience of truth.

281
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,630
And when you're in the
experience of truth,

282
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,480
that's when you can
really become who you are.

283
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:50,990
But,

284
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,460
but to get to who you are,

285
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,371
it's like when you know,

286
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:54,830
when a bone heals the wrong way,

287
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,980
like that's what a lot of
people's entire personality is.

288
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:02,981
It's like a bone that grew the wrong
way and that needs a fucking a snap,

289
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,123
a crack,

290
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,471
you know,

291
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:04,821
and we,

292
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:05,760
you get that through sex,

293
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,251
you need that,

294
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,540
that initial fucking thing.

295
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,970
And it's a beautiful analogy and it hurts.

296
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,991
It hurts.

297
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,550
But we're paying avoiding creatures.

298
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:14,360
So we think that,

299
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,370
so we're always running
away from this pain.

300
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,490
But the problem is as we're
running away from pain,

301
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,040
we're still exactly in pain.

302
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,340
It's basically like being on
fire and running away from water.

303
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,530
You're just running away
from the water because you,

304
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:28,101
for some,

305
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:28,461
I don't know,

306
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:31,400
that's a stupid analogy
actually for doing great.

307
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:34,240
Up until that you had
a lot of great points.

308
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,074
What it's true,

309
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:35,420
you know,

310
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,090
there's the monster in the
dark and the faster you run,

311
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:40,820
the more likely you are to
run into something that's
actually going to hurt you

312
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,500
as opposed to turning around and saying,

313
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,071
Oh fuck,

314
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:43,904
there is no monster.

315
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,461
No Monster.

316
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:44,721
No.

317
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:47,270
But you never get to know that
until you stop and turn around.

318
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:47,670
You know?

319
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,390
And in some cases people don't
have the discipline or the,

320
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:53,750
the assistance or the balls to stop.

321
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,130
And turn around so they have to
trip over something and then there's

322
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,311
like,

323
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:57,144
oh,

324
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,280
there's the classic story
of someone hiding a secret
and going completely out of

325
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:04,380
control because of the
pressure of hiding that.

326
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:04,741
Right.

327
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:09,480
Like that's the Ted Haggerty who's the
secretly gay guy who's preaching against

328
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,141
gay people.

329
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:15,141
Ted Haggard in Colorado was
snorting meth off his gay lovers.

330
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,363
Yeah.

331
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,090
Yeah.

332
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,770
We was just going so far the other way.

333
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:22,560
He just so off the rails crazy himself.

334
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,340
He's being himself.

335
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,480
He was a guy who likes
to snort math off of Cox,

336
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,340
who I still a little math and he likes to,

337
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:28,990
well,

338
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,030
there's a few Cox,

339
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,710
but I would say he wasn't being himself.

340
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,330
What I would say is that his,

341
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,390
his behavior was so extreme because he
was seeking balance between that and the

342
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,040
other bull shit in his life.

343
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,600
Whereas if he weren't living that,

344
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,980
he'd be right in the middle.

345
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,700
Right?

346
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,001
Yeah.

347
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,380
Well to give it to get to the middle.

348
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:46,801
You know,

349
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,980
the way to get to the middle weirdly
is whatever the behavior is that you're

350
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,610
doing that you're so horrified
about and terrified of sometimes.

351
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,440
They're really weird ideas.

352
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,890
This is like something that
I liked that Ron doss has,

353
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,570
which is like if you don't
feel like meditating,

354
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:01,404
don't meditate.

355
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,461
Don't force it.

356
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,930
Don't impose this on yourself.

357
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,620
Keep doing the thing you're doing
that's upsetting you so much.

358
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:10,470
Have the balls to keep doing the
fucking thing that you're doing.

359
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
Keep doing it.

360
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,470
If society is going to tell you,

361
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:14,400
don't be like this.

362
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,600
Stop being like this.

363
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:16,500
You have to change.

364
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,060
That's what your parents always say.

365
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,710
The idea is like no,

366
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,310
sink into what you are right now.

367
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,870
Just be that thing.

368
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Stop resisting exactly where you are
right now is perfect and that's a hard

369
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:32,820
truth to grasp.

370
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,020
I will take,

371
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:37,920
I would take 5,000 Casey
Anthony's over one.

372
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,990
Nancy grace any day of the week.

373
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,960
Nancy grace is a fucking foul.

374
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:48,150
Necrophiles I think she is so much
more disgusting than some strippers kid

375
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,980
gotten to her ecstasy
or whatever happened.

376
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:50,580
It's like,

377
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,180
who?

378
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,930
Who like,

379
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,360
yeah,

380
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,950
a dumb girls kiss.

381
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:55,770
She left the kid in the
backseat of the car,

382
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,290
fell on the Kiddie pool cause
she's negligent or whatever.

383
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,390
It's like sad and terrible.

384
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:05,391
But Nancy grace get like clearly
getting off on the whole situation.

385
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,103
I hate those,

386
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,070
uh,

387
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,990
those tabloid death.

388
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,750
Hags like grace.

389
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:11,911
I,

390
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:15,840
there's some other woman I saw too
is like on the view and she was like,

391
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,290
we just got the verdict,

392
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,660
the Casey Anthony Verdict.

393
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,850
I'm gonna need your help here.

394
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,503
She said,

395
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,270
Oh God,

396
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,103
you,

397
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,671
no,

398
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:29,600
it's just disgusting.

399
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,900
You're weeping because this
one mother got off the hook.

400
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,620
Meanwhile,

401
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,750
every year in Afghanistan and Iraq,

402
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,230
the UN is dropping bombs on neighborhoods.

403
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,080
Kids are getting blown to smithereens.

404
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,290
Kids are getting transformed
into hamburger meat on a
daily basis and the Middle

405
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,481
East,

406
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:51,740
because of our fucked up drones that
keep accidentally bombing weddings and

407
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:54,010
neighborhoods and these murder,

408
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,540
these death hags are freaking
out over one dead child.

409
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:58,931
I mean,

410
00:11:58,931 --> 00:11:59,764
it's sad.

411
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,820
It's very sad.

412
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,890
That cake Caylee Anthony died.

413
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,071
I mean,

414
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:04,530
I think that's terribly sad.

415
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,150
But when you hear Nancy
grace being like Kylie,

416
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:12,151
Anthony's bleached bones were found but
cable or pyre up writer and all those

417
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,321
honor.

418
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,190
Nick was one fabric,

419
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:16,900
one bit of her taste shirt.

420
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,520
It's like there's a grow,

421
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,840
there's a disgusting,

422
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,030
there's something perverse behind it.

423
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:22,721
Thank you.

424
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:23,554
Sorry about that

425
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,071
dude.

426
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:24,701
You don't have to.

427
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:27,070
I'm a big Fan Bashing Nancy grace.

428
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,923
What a pig.

429
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,250
There's something gross about when I,

430
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,920
whenever I see someone who's angry and
they're fat like that and I'm like,

431
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,540
maybe you need to go on a diet and
you won't be so fucking angry dog.

432
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,221
The bounty.

433
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:40,030
I see someone with his
big jowls in this big,

434
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,001
you know I've,

435
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:42,640
I'm like exercise,

436
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,151
eat right.

437
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:44,260
Take some yoga classes.

438
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,580
You'll approach this all
totally different somewhere.

439
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,630
The devil is dancing to not the top.

440
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:51,070
Mom's off the hook.

441
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,690
Tiger Woods.

442
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,310
That's a another one.

443
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:54,941
She went after.

444
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,380
She went off to tiger woods for like,

445
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,580
you guys need to stop watching me.

446
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:58,600
So much slides.

447
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,150
Brilliant.

448
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,580
I think him and Nancy Grace are going
to burn and a specific part of whatever

449
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:07,930
hell there may be my baby that
gets eaten by Florida for it.

450
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,120
It will turn into a
mouth and eat that baby.

451
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,140
I think he's hoping the swamps will open
up and you'll see teeth come out of the

452
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:14,740
ground.

453
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,850
Snatch up the child.

454
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,111
Man,

455
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:18,550
I would love to dead babies.

456
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,110
It wasn't looking for Laura De,

457
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,461
you know,

458
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:22,420
it'd be so fun.

459
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,640
This is a weird thought that
I've had to wait a minute.

460
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:25,370
You yeah,

461
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,050
I know.

462
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,700
Get Out.

463
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,660
But if Nancy grace as a full grown
thing is disgusting and foul,

464
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,920
but if you could shrink Nancy grace down
and have like a pocket Nancy grace that

465
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:37,270
lived in a little aquarium,

466
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,210
some little judgemental death con
that you hadn't been in an aquarium.

467
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:44,044
That was just

468
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,010
a little show to the right thing.

469
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,140
Tiger Woods,

470
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,811
Charles,

471
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,270
those girls that he loved them.

472
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,160
We'll go to the next caller.

473
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,070
Is it a dead baby in Florida?

474
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:04,090
It is the semen stains on the mattress.

475
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:05,410
Can we zoom in on those?

476
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,740
Let's get dog the bounty hunter and here
to dirty nails scratching your clit,

477
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:12,820
going Pumpkin,

478
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,723
Siemens,

479
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,913
Simon.

480
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,010
That's her mantra.

481
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:18,671
When she walks,

482
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:22,360
she chant Simon steins and Nancy grace
holds the world record for the longest

483
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,510
squirt ever by a female vagina kind of

484
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,840
squirt like 18 feet.

485
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:29,050
Yeah,

486
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,490
I think that that sport happened,

487
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,241
did not score.

488
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,670
It happened when she saw Jon
Benet Ramsey death picture.

489
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,371
And,

490
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:36,520
uh,

491
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,520
I've gotten more than one email from
really dumb people think that because I am

492
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:45,970
playing at the Masonic Auditorium,

493
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,990
it just proves that I am
a new world order shill.

494
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,301
You're,

495
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:51,760
you're an reptile dude.

496
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,690
You follow why bringer.

497
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:54,530
Lord Lucifer,

498
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,100
I am a part of the masonic,

499
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,610
uh,

500
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,630
what do they call themselves?

501
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,464
Brotherhood.

502
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,310
They're a fraternity and fraternity
part of the Masonic fraternity.

503
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,001
And uh,

504
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,410
I mean with the new world order,

505
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,630
because I'm planning at
the Nob Hill Masonic it,

506
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,930
you know what a Mason told me once he
said that what it's all about is that math

507
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,970
or geometry is the first
language of the universe.

508
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:20,980
It's like the first language of God.

509
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,023
And so like,

510
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,720
they're super into sacred geometry.

511
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:26,921
Like,

512
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,000
that's a big thing.

513
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:32,020
And like the whole thing is based
on building the Temple of Solomon,

514
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:32,830
which is where you,

515
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,420
how's the Ark of the covenant?

516
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:34,961
You know,

517
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:36,310
it's all symbolic of course.

518
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,670
But the new temple of Solomon that
they're trying to build according to the

519
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:42,940
conspiracy theorists is
society like this is it.

520
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:45,550
Like society is the New Temple of Solomon.

521
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:49,120
And part of that was getting the United
States revolution to happen because they

522
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,760
help fund that and also fucking DC,

523
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,970
the street layout of DC is all masonic
symbols and that goddamn obelisks popping

524
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,690
up out of the middle of fucking DC,

525
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,530
that weird thing.

526
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,480
And it's all over our fucking money.

527
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,021
So yeah,

528
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:02,560
Joe,

529
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,890
we are worried about you.

530
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,580
There is something going
on behind the scenes,

531
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:11,970
right?

532
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,450
I mean it's,

533
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,290
it's clear if you look at the design
of Washington DC and folks who should

534
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,700
really should look this up online,

535
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:18,810
cause it's not something that,

536
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,130
it's irrefutable.

537
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,120
The Grid,

538
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,571
the grid,

539
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:23,190
the way they've lined up the streets,

540
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,870
the way they put the
buildings and everything.

541
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,240
I mean it literally is masonic symbols.

542
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,840
It is.

543
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,700
And it's all of our fucking money to,

544
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,200
yeah.

545
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,381
Yeah.

546
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,620
What's up with that
fucking all seeing eye,

547
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,590
just an eye on top of a
pyramid that makes sense.

548
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,250
The United States and its
long love affair with Egypt.

549
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,800
Think how the Egyptians
help form our constitution.

550
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,560
Right.

551
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,710
No one thinks about that shit.

552
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,730
That's what's so fun about the call.

553
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,001
You know,

554
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:52,190
cause the word a call itself means hidden,

555
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,790
but it's like hidden in plain view
because this shit's in front of everybody.

556
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,380
Like all the people who deny conspiracy
theories and stuff in their wallet or

557
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:04,640
Fucking rectangles covered in
Egyptian occult symbology did.

558
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,600
They don't even think about,

559
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,940
for folks who don't know the,

560
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,910
what the symbols are in Washington DC,

561
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,911
the way it's set up is
one of them is a Lucifer,

562
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,630
uh,

563
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,430
uptight upside down Pentagram.

564
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:20,060
Sure.

565
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,361
I mean,

566
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:22,190
so the horns stick up in the air.

567
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,360
I mean there's,

568
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,840
that's,

569
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,560
that's there.

570
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,940
I mean they did design this.

571
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,800
They really did design
the streets like this.

572
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,330
And the other one is,

573
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:30,050
um,

574
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,080
like that masonic symbol that
looks like a measuring device.

575
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,010
Yeah.

576
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,281
Yeah.

577
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:34,531
That,

578
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:35,420
that means a lot.

579
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:35,721
But yeah,

580
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,201
that's why,

581
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:37,160
that's why they liked that,

582
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:37,994
because they're trying,

583
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,090
what they're trying to do is to
sort of articulate the primary,

584
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,533
um,

585
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,400
the,

586
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:45,920
the,

587
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,500
the very first way that the universe form,

588
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:53,501
which is through geometry or through
like a cascade of like specific physical

589
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,790
laws that are based on math.

590
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,350
It's super fucking cool,

591
00:17:58,351 --> 00:17:58,650
man.

592
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,210
I mean,

593
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,420
it's what masons are.

594
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:00,721
Well,

595
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:02,970
that's what amazing told me at a wedding.

596
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:03,391
I don't know.

597
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,290
He's drunk too.

598
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,124
I don't know.

599
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,161
Yeah.

600
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,860
I met a drunk mason at a,

601
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:11,810
at a show at the laugh factory in Houston.

602
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,510
It was showing me his mason ids and shit.

603
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,380
And I'm like,

604
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:16,850
what the fuck is being a mason?

605
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:17,150
What do you,

606
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,961
what do you guys do?

607
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:18,231
It's like,

608
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:18,681
Oh man,

609
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,090
it's just secret society.

610
00:18:20,091 --> 00:18:20,510
You know,

611
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,343
hung out together.

612
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:21,901
Yeah.

613
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,770
Hang out together.

614
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:25,710
We had two rituals where you
come out of a fucking coffin.

615
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,700
I know that happens.

616
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,231
Okay.

617
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,560
But how much power do you
really think they have?

618
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:32,720
We'll try to use,

619
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,280
is there really anything to what
they're doing or is like being a mason?

620
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:38,114
Just fun?

621
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:38,990
Uh,

622
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,330
I an elk's lodge ever.

623
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,000
There's bunches,

624
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,650
there's many different levels of the
thing and I imagine that a lot of Masons,

625
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,490
uh,

626
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,980
are probably in politics and when you're,

627
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:52,260
when you're in a fraternity
and you're in politics,

628
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,520
you're probably going to pay deference
to other people in your fraternity when

629
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:59,580
it comes to working together to make
laws happen or whatever you're up to.

630
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,160
So I though a lot of people say
it's a waning population that,

631
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,950
that the masons are kind of like dying
out because fewer young people are

632
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:10,530
signing up because they don't recruit.

633
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,560
So to become a mason
you have to ask a mason,

634
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,480
so you'd have to go to the
masonic lodge and be like,

635
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,950
I want to become a Freemason.

636
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,610
And then they do like background
checks on you and become masons.

637
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:21,180
Yes,

638
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,770
let's do it.

639
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,220
I think it'd be a blast.

640
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,110
What do you think is
good about being a mason?

641
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,880
I think ceremony is people

642
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,013
that's right now in front of

643
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,640
Peter.

644
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,900
It's fucking shit.

645
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,160
He's a fucking new world order.

646
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:32,910
Shields.

647
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,700
Where's the Alex Jones hotline number?

648
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,200
I need to call him.

649
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:37,830
Right.

650
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,830
Joe Rogan has publicly admitted
on his show that he is amazing.

651
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,830
He has Duncan Trussell on talks about
how wonderful it is to be amazing and

652
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:51,900
spreading propaganda.

653
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,490
And this information about
Mason's being about geometry,

654
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,200
they're about control or
about taking your soul,

655
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,410
ladies and gentlemen,

656
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,010
not going to stand for,

657
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,701
well man,

658
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:09,181
I don't know.

659
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:09,730
You know,

660
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,410
I who knows.

661
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,150
I think uh,

662
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,530
ceremony is a,

663
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,330
as something that is missing from a lot
of people's lives in our culture because

664
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:19,680
it's so goddamn weird.

665
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,191
And I was like,

666
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,300
someone wants to get married.

667
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,883
Yeah,

668
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,461
yeah,

669
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:24,210
I guess so.

670
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:24,670
Yeah.

671
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,570
If someone wants to get mad,

672
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:26,760
well that is that definitely,

673
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,200
that is definitely a ceremony.

674
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:28,830
But like,

675
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,101
you know,

676
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:32,130
there's a lot of other ceremonies
to that aren't quite so,

677
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:32,700
uh,

678
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,980
based on like on stupid shit.

679
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:35,814
But I mean there,

680
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,800
but they are like,

681
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,260
there's their,

682
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,660
their psychedelic man.

683
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:40,950
And like I read this somewhere,

684
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:41,790
I don't remember who said it,

685
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,330
but it was uh,

686
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,230
an interesting point,

687
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:48,100
which is that a rock show is a ceremony
and the sense that you're going to this

688
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,400
to watch people on stage crew like doing
like songs which are a kind of chant

689
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,400
that everyone already knows and you're
taking psychedelics to go enjoy this

690
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:58,090
thick.

691
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,923
So it's like that,

692
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,381
you know,

693
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:03,340
that Youngian idea that like there's
just certain basic things that tend to

694
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:05,710
repeat through all different cultures.

695
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,350
And the way it's repeated in
our culture is more through,

696
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm going to go see a rock show and
dress in a certain way and take a

697
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:15,700
psychedelic and trip out and have a kind
of transcendent experience that comes

698
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:16,534
through the music.

699
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,680
But it used to be like,

700
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:20,200
there's more formal versions of that idea,

701
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,060
which is like you take a psychedelic
and then you do a series of like

702
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,780
intonations or whatever the fuck it is
depending on what religion or cult you're

703
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:28,300
in.

704
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,660
And that creates a kind of
transcendent connective experience,

705
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,400
which I think is fucking awesome.

706
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,530
And it's fun to just watch regardless of
whether or not you believe in what that

707
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,900
red religion or ritual
is trying to invoke.

708
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,010
It's just cool to watch that
form of dance and movement happen

709
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,070
that the horrible idea,

710
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:50,880
especially horrible to bring it up to
anybody who's had poor fortune in this

711
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:54,360
life is to somehow or another
connected with past lives.

712
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:54,741
You know,

713
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:56,180
and you've ever heard
someone say that like,

714
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,341
Oh,

715
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:58,170
you must've been a real
fuck had in his past life.

716
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,010
And it's like,

717
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,641
wow,

718
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:00,930
like what are you really?

719
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,130
Are you sure?

720
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,950
You sure could it just not be a roll of
the dice and maybe part of your Karma is

721
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,610
recognizing that?

722
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,511
I think that,

723
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:10,691
yeah,

724
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:11,830
that's why I like the uh,

725
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,390
you know,

726
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,790
uh,

727
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,623
Buddha.

728
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,931
Yeah,

729
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:14,590
I like him.

730
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,960
Like Buddha said,

731
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:17,590
don't well,

732
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,300
don't think about the afterlife so much.

733
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:20,410
I think even Christ said,

734
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,730
I am the god of the living,

735
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:22,810
not the god of the dead.

736
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,000
The idea being the voice.

737
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,860
I am the god of the living.

738
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,910
It's a good,

739
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,410
I think real spiritual masters always
tend to try to bring people back into the

740
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,580
present moment because it's like,

741
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:33,910
yeah,

742
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,680
you know what the present
moment is everything.

743
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,230
I know when Shit goes wrong in my life,

744
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,820
I know why it went wrong.

745
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,840
I don't have to go back to when I was
a fryer and the 18 hundreds and like

746
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,250
fisted a fucking,

747
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,420
you know none.

748
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,580
I know that if shit's
going wrong right now,

749
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:49,414
generally it's like,

750
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,250
cause I'm fucking up now.

751
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,390
It's good for,

752
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,680
and people can get lost.

753
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,270
People can start blaming their,

754
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,500
their Karma,

755
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,340
uh,

756
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,200
or where they're at
right now in past lives.

757
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:02,260
And it puts him in this place of stupid
hopelessness and they don't do the

758
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:04,900
things they need to do right
now to get to a better place.

759
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,710
Praise Jesus.

760
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,640
Praise the Lord.

761
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:06,950
Because I,

762
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,550
his name's so many fucking say,

763
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:08,681
hey,

764
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:09,170
his name,

765
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:09,440
how many

766
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,430
simple things you could do,

767
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:10,910
man,

768
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,390
all you got.

769
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,170
Here's what you have to do.

770
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,220
This is my new theory.

771
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,240
Identify the vampire in your life.

772
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,580
Find the vampire,

773
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,230
identify the parasite.

774
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,600
It doesn't have to be that
you have parasites in life.

775
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,080
It is possible that you could've gotten
lucky and there's no parasites and you

776
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:27,860
get off groovy.

777
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,071
Sure.

778
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:28,281
No,

779
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,780
I'm not saying everyone's got one,

780
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,340
but if you got one,

781
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,720
if you're walking around with
those fucking vampire blues,

782
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,690
you've got the fucking
heavy heart and you'd,

783
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,980
and you can't feel happy and you feel bad,

784
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,470
there may be an action that you need
to take that you're afraid take.

785
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,430
That's the vampire and you've
got to fucking not even a person.

786
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,391
Oh No,

787
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:52,070
I mean it's a situation,

788
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:52,904
a,

789
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,241
yeah,

790
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:54,560
it's a vampire in your life.

791
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,920
Find the life sucking situation
that you're afraid to kill.

792
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,790
And the reason I say vampires because
vampire is only go or they're invited.

793
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,130
And generally the
situation that you're in,

794
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,540
you invited it in,

795
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,770
you invited this thing into your life
and now it's sucking your life energy in

796
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:12,050
your blood and your happiness away,

797
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,360
don't it?

798
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,580
And it's in a lot of times
you'll try to believe,

799
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:19,220
you'll try to convince yourself
that this thing is not a vampire,

800
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,271
but in your heart,

801
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:22,130
you know you're a servant.

802
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,540
To a fucking blood sucker.

803
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,020
You are.

804
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,853
Ren felt.

805
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,620
This thing is like sucking
your life as it's way.

806
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,050
Sometimes it's doing it with a trade.

807
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,120
Quite often there'll be a bad trade.

808
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,931
You'll be,

809
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:33,171
you know,

810
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,820
whatever the situation
you're in and you'll,

811
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:35,061
you'll,

812
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:35,540
it'll be,

813
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,340
you'll feel like you're in the situation.

814
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:37,821
You know,

815
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:38,361
it's worth it.

816
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:39,051
It's kind of bad,

817
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:39,884
but it's totally worth it.

818
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,930
This happens with jobs quite often,

819
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:42,231
you know,

820
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:42,561
or you're like,

821
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:42,771
well,

822
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:43,131
you know,

823
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:44,690
but it's good enough.

824
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,710
That's the vampire.

825
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,170
You got to take a fucking stake and drive
it into its art to how do you kill a

826
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:51,561
vampire?

827
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:52,280
Two ways.

828
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,330
Direct Action.

829
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,940
You don't kill a vampire by
like making up with a vampire.

830
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:59,180
You don't kill the vampire by like having
a sit down and talk with a vampire.

831
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,470
You're not going to be able to like,

832
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,310
uh,

833
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,960
you know,

834
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,390
uh,

835
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,510
make friends with the vampire.

836
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:04,730
There's two ways to kill a vampire.

837
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:05,360
One,

838
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,960
you fucking,

839
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,660
you know,

840
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,230
uh,

841
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:07,790
uh,

842
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,660
put a stake in its heart.

843
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:09,980
The other one is light,

844
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,880
sunlight,

845
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,713
truth,

846
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,510
light that it's the greatest
metaphor of all time.

847
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,620
You shine the light of
truth onto the situation,

848
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,520
fearlessly analyze it and
then you'll destroy it.

849
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:22,881
You know?

850
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:25,400
Because if you really allow
yourself a few can act,

851
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,301
you got to add.

852
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:28,940
The real problem with people
is not recognizing the enemy.

853
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,200
It's acting on that enemy.

854
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,280
That's the real problem.

855
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,440
And that enemy being,

856
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:33,741
you know,

857
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:34,221
personal,

858
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:35,210
your personal demons,

859
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:35,361
your,

860
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,860
your personal jihad,

861
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,480
that's a personal issue.

862
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
You got to fight the beast and it's,

863
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,050
and you know what I mean?

864
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:43,460
It's like everybody's beast is different.

865
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:45,110
Chapter two of the Bhagavad Gita,

866
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,520
arginase dejection arginine has
drawn between these two forces.

867
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,750
He does not want to fight.

868
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,750
He drops his bow and God says to him,

869
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,940
you've got rise to the fight.

870
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,690
Fight.

871
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,560
You're a warrior.

872
00:25:57,561 --> 00:25:58,970
This is what you're here for.

873
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,953
Fight,

874
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,531
fight.

875
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:00,980
It's,

876
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,300
it's better to die.

877
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,460
It's better to die in a righteous battle.

878
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:07,310
Then goes skulking off into the
fucking woods and be a beggar.

879
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,330
It's better to fucking do what you do on
your award or you got to fucking do it,

880
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:11,840
man.

881
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,830
It fucking sucks.

882
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,390
When when you're drunk and you want to
throw up and you try to not make yourself

883
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:18,224
throw up,

884
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,370
just throw up.

885
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,720
You'll feel better.

886
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,920
You'll feel better in the end.

887
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:24,290
When you're puking it's going to suck
because you're helpless and you can't

888
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:24,890
breathe.

889
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,551
Go through it,

890
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:26,030
man.

891
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,400
Fucking jab a fucking knife into the fuck.

892
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:29,540
Not Literally of course,

893
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,350
but yeah,

894
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,320
you got to act and you got to make the
big fucking decisions sometimes and it's

895
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:34,154
scary.

896
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,390
If it wasn't scary,

897
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:36,410
it wouldn't be worth anything.

898
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,010
Yeah.

899
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,810
For some people it's almost like
they don't know how to start the,

900
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,500
they know that there's actions
that need to take in their life,

901
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,480
but they're paralyzed
trying to think about it,

902
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,290
trying to figure out how to start and
they can never gather up the courage to

903
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:49,930
get away.

904
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,280
It's like,

905
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,611
what's not.

906
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,320
A lot of people stay in
abusive relationships.

907
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:52,620
They don't,

908
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,820
they don't have the courage to leave.

909
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,601
Exactly.

910
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,000
Cause it's scary and it in
it and it seems like it,

911
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:57,361
you know,

912
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:00,870
there's so many things that people
will like w ideas people will create.

913
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,160
They'll keep you trapped.

914
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:03,000
And whenever prisoner,

915
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,310
it's very similar to um,

916
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,390
and not,

917
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:06,660
I mean,

918
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,050
what you're talking about in the
UFC with these fucking fighters,

919
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,800
this is a visual representation of
what anyone can do in their life.

920
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:14,670
But you mean you're not getting,

921
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:17,870
maybe not all of us are going to get
obviously be worldclass fighters.

922
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:21,420
They get in a ring in front of the entire
planet and fucking knock someone out.

923
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,590
But you have in your life right now,

924
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:26,730
if you haven't already done this,

925
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,650
is you have the chance to be heroic.

926
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,510
You have the ability right
now to make a heroic act.

927
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,500
They could kill you.

928
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,730
That's the thing,

929
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,451
these actions,

930
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:38,820
it's not always guaranteed that
because you do the right thing,

931
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,890
you're going to end up in a great place.

932
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,390
You might end up fucked.

933
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,290
You might end up,

934
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,370
you might end up temporarily and a
homeless or you might end up temporarily

935
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,450
jobless.

936
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,520
If there wasn't risk associated with it,

937
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,110
you would have already done it.

938
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,183
That's the point.

939
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:53,650
You know,

940
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,960
there wasn't risk associated with,

941
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:56,130
it wouldn't be worth anything.

942
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:56,881
You know,

943
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:57,750
if Mount Fucking,

944
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,710
uh,

945
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,010
you know,

946
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,500
if the Himalayas where you know,

947
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,410
a little green grass
covered hill in a park,

948
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,060
nobody takes pictures of them at the top.

949
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,970
Budding a flag into what is a danger.

950
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:10,410
Makes it heroic.

951
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,041
You know?

952
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,990
So sometimes you just have to fucking,

953
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,250
I sound like Tony Robbins.

954
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,270
Take the leap.

955
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,830
Kill the vampire in your life till
the vamp on you love is a brilliance.

956
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,121
Preach,

957
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:19,630
dude.

958
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:19,870
You,

959
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,703
you're dead right.

960
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,190
Anytime you fucking kill that vampire,

961
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,480
if you survive,

962
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,540
flowers will rain from heaven.

963
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,520
How's your bloom?

964
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,940
You can get better.

965
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:30,780
Everybody can get better.

966
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:32,730
We can all over their
eyes and move forward.

967
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,500
But you've got to be positive as fuck.

968
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,140
Don't be convinced that you
have anything figured out.

969
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,870
[inaudible].
