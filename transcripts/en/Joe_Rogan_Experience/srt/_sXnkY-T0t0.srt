1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,870
You're so good at breaking shit down,

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:04,704
dude.

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,050
You,

5
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,220
you said that there was
not a hint of bias there.

6
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:09,900
You were being completely honest about it.

7
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:10,470
That's,

8
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,050
I really value that in the way you talk.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,680
And uh,

10
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,290
that's why I was really happy when a,

11
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:20,250
I watched that Kamau bell
show em Kamau Bell Come Matt,

12
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,190
I totally biased for command Melia,

13
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,430
which was a w w Kamau Bell,

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,410
you and Lindy West,

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,770
Lindy West who's a,

16
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,520
a feminist blogger for Jezza bell,

17
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:34,470
which is a feminist website.

18
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,630
And what I loved about
it man was first of all,

19
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,920
you never got upset.

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,470
You,

21
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,730
you were rational and logical and you had,

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,341
you were,

23
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:46,380
you were talking about it in a very
measured way and you're being really

24
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:49,950
friendly while you were
discussing this and you know,

25
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:50,784
in her,

26
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,690
in her defense,

27
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,780
it's a very tricky subject
to breach for a woman.

28
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,010
And she was saying a lot of shit like
comedy clubs are filled with rooms filled

29
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,660
with angry men and he didn't,

30
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,740
he didn't even flinch.

31
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,440
He didn't,

32
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,870
he didn't go after her.

33
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:04,080
You know,

34
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,510
she had like these digs about like,

35
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:06,691
you know,

36
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,100
you're allowed to joke about it,

37
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,570
but I'm allowed to tell you're a dick.

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,673
You know,

39
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,311
personally,

40
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:12,110
cause I didn't think she lacked,

41
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:12,660
she hadn't,

42
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,100
the blog wasn't about me.

43
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,090
It was about a guy who,

44
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,630
any guy making addiction or
certain rape jokes that put,

45
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,130
and this is the tricky part of Lindy West,

46
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:21,690
he's a lot of people
would say she's against,

47
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,531
she's for censorship,

48
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:23,364
but she really wasn't.

49
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,810
She was about,

50
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,160
she didn't like the jokes that she thought
minimalize the victim in a rape right

51
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,660
now it's hard to logically say,

52
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,250
well yeah,

53
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:31,801
minimalize you.

54
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:32,970
The victim of rape is a good thing.

55
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:33,951
But she,

56
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:34,391
you know what,

57
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:35,340
what people forget,

58
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,480
they went after Sam morale,

59
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,160
a lot of jokes or just misdirection.

60
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,180
He's a comedian in New York who had done
some like domestic violence jokes or

61
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:42,870
whatever.

62
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,610
But in a misdirection joke,

63
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,863
you,

64
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,823
you go for the,

65
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,131
the,

66
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:50,520
the most obvious or opposite thing.

67
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,730
So yeah,

68
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,830
sometimes it's like I did one joke
and this didn't come up in that show,

69
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,120
but like I was talking about,

70
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,600
uh,

71
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,381
seeing it a girl,

72
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:58,531
no,

73
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:01,590
I don't know if she had a good time
or it was raped in a Porta potty.

74
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,150
I'm not gonna go through
the whole joke before,

75
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,640
but it was at a concert
and outdoor concert.

76
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,410
So the two most opposite things I could
think of if I said I didn't know if she

77
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:12,510
had a good time or not a very good time,

78
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,780
who gives a shit fuck hill
raped in a Porta potty?

79
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,423
Painting a picture.

80
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,430
If I said I didn't know if she was beaten
in a Porta potty or raped in a Porta

81
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:20,760
potty,

82
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,380
nobody would've laughed
because they're too close.

83
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,101
So the fact,

84
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:23,310
I mean,

85
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,600
I'm explaining this to the audience,

86
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:28,020
not jus the fact that you take two
things at a such polar opposites.

87
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,640
Sometimes the polar opposite you land
on for the joke is a horrible thing that

88
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:34,680
minimalizes the victim and a,

89
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:38,340
every Catholic priest joke is
somehow minimalizing the victim part.

90
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,540
Comedy does that.

91
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,960
And I don't believe that it has to
just be speaking truth to power.

92
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,010
I think that's part of it.

93
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,570
But I think that as long as your intention
is genuinely to be funny and not to

94
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,280
humiliate a person for real,

95
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,030
um,

96
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,020
I think it's allowable.

97
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,990
And it has to be because it gets
to be too subjective after that.

98
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,201
Well,

99
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,100
it's an art form.

100
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,960
And if you don't like that art form,

101
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,540
I completely and totally understand that,

102
00:02:59,541 --> 00:02:59,650
right?

103
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,380
You don't have to participate
to participate in the shelves.

104
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,214
You don't have to go.

105
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,540
But when you're,

106
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,200
you're being hypercritical about and
trying to get people to stop doing it,

107
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,780
you're going to make it so that,

108
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:11,500
that our form is not available.

109
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,030
Like the really fucked up thing that you
don't mean art form is not available.

110
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,410
Just like rap music.

111
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:17,730
I mean,

112
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,000
what is going on in rap music?

113
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:22,120
Or they're really running around killing
people and selling cocaine every day.

114
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,571
No.

115
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:25,120
Most of what they're doing is
talking shit about something.

116
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,330
Right?

117
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,550
It's no different than the movie Scarface.

118
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,320
Nobody really died in that movie.

119
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,950
Okay.

120
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,191
You're,

121
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,390
you're painting a picture.

122
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:32,224
It's a gross,

123
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,310
horrific picture.

124
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,050
But some people like that,

125
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,350
they like to watch Scarface than
like the listen to rap music.

126
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,090
They want to hear a dirty comic,

127
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:41,170
say horrendous,

128
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,090
inappropriate things that are fucked up.

129
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,160
One of my favorites is auto,

130
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,090
auto and George.

131
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,850
He would say some of the most fucked up,

132
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:50,560
ridiculous over the top shit.

133
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,340
But the reason why I did it is because
that's like what shocks is shit out of

134
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,470
you and makes you laugh
when you least expect it.

135
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:56,891
And it was like,

136
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,960
well crafted in on time.

137
00:03:58,961 --> 00:03:59,570
Top of that.

138
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,120
He made me laugh harder than anybody's
ever made me laugh in a club.

139
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:04,790
We were doing a pizzeria in
Pennsylvania and he said something.

140
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,031
It was,

141
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:06,170
it was barbarism.

142
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,550
And it made me,

143
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,370
it was because of the imagery was such,

144
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,880
it was,

145
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,151
it was,

146
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:15,470
it was such poetry that he flew
off the top with and it was awful.

147
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,940
And uh,

148
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:17,770
have you ever told you this story?

149
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,470
No.

150
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:18,831
And it was,

151
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:19,150
it's,

152
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,090
it's like,

153
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:20,511
it won't hold,

154
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,131
like if I say it now,

155
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:22,160
it's not gonna be the greatest jokey,

156
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,120
but the beauty of it,

157
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,140
we were in a pizzeria.

158
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,310
It was an awful gig.

159
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,330
And,

160
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,163
um,

161
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,870
it was,

162
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,251
it was,

163
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,084
uh,

164
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:29,811
it was like,

165
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,670
we're like real pizzeria bench seats.

166
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,600
It stunk.

167
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,320
Right.

168
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,591
And,

169
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:33,861
uh,

170
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,350
there was a bar next to it and I'm
watching it autos just up there,

171
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:38,390
fucking struggling and hating it.

172
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,640
And in the middle of this dirty act,

173
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:41,151
the bookers,

174
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:46,040
Griffin walks down the aisle
with her seven year old son,

175
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,690
which was so inappropriate.

176
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:48,830
And everybody looked at it,

177
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,450
just derails the show.

178
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,093
And Auto,

179
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,943
uh,

180
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,700
just said,

181
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:53,901
uh,

182
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:54,260
you know,

183
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,510
cause everyone looked at this.

184
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:57,530
So the fucking,

185
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,110
the puppet addressed it and said,

186
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:00,880
uh,

187
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,091
oh,

188
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:01,580
is it,

189
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,480
I make a,

190
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,383
isn't that cute?

191
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,610
I like to grab him by the ankles and
smashes Skoll onto a fucking sink.

192
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,600
And it was a calligrapher
reference to the end of Caligula.

193
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,830
And it made me the,

194
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,280
the,

195
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,760
the,

196
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,540
the speed at which he put
those words together and the,

197
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:17,751
the,

198
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,700
the violence attached to that.

199
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,571
Uh,

200
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,670
and the imagery of that.

201
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:21,960
It May,

202
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,980
I've never laughed wider.

203
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,640
Anything anybody's ever said in a
comedy club because I knew what had just

204
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:26,900
happened is it was just,

205
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,450
I immediately saw the end
of calendula where they go,

206
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:32,240
they grab the ankles and they smash
the fucking head into the steps.

207
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,600
And I'm like the genius to
pull that out in this moment.

208
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,100
And where did that quickly,

209
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:37,790
it's just,

210
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,091
it was,

211
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:38,450
it was,

212
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,470
it was beauty.

213
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:40,221
It was beauty,

214
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:43,070
but it was a horror and nobody laughed.

215
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,780
Of course they didn't

216
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,630
fulfill the pizzeria.

217
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:47,970
He,

218
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,950
nobody understood how funny that was.

219
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,801
He had just said that,

220
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:53,090
and I hadn't seen calendula.

221
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,860
I might not have laughed as hard,

222
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,710
but the fact that I
immediately saw he did with it,

223
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:58,040
I was just,

224
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,080
I wanted to hug him for that.

225
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,461
Brilliant,

226
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,121
brilliant guy.

227
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,260
He's a brilliant fuck man.

228
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,520
He's a very funny guy.

229
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,230
And his style of comedy,

230
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,640
much like dice is style,

231
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:11,300
colony is ridiculous over the top things.

232
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:16,220
They don't really mean like dice has a
some bit about about how a woman gets

233
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,410
pregnant and it's,

234
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:17,651
it's,

235
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:19,070
it's one of the most hilarious,

236
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:23,480
ridiculous bits because it goes into like
this medical or how you can make a gay

237
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,314
kid,

238
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,070
like how,

239
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,430
you know,

240
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,430
like it's so fucking ridiculous idiocy.

241
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,330
It's completed.

242
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,410
But it's hilarious.

243
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,230
And for people to say that
that's a homophobic joke,

244
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,870
that's like,

245
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,070
no,

246
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,880
he doesn't believe.

247
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,870
He doesn't mean a word.

248
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:36,704
He's saying,

249
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,910
do you understand that this is,

250
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,160
this is like an art piece
that you're watching.

251
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,910
This is just a ridiculous
over the top art piece.

252
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,070
And for you to say that it's not,

253
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,110
if you to say that I
shouldn't be enjoying it,

254
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,340
well then we have to go with a fine
tooth comb over virtually all of pop

255
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:52,970
culture,

256
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,990
every song.

257
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,440
We have to find out what the
true meaning behind movies are.

258
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,600
What's the implication on society?

259
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,520
Because he can't just be humor.

260
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,190
It's,

261
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,510
it's,

262
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,570
it's a dumb way of looking
at it because you know,

263
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,950
it's a joke.

264
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,510
If it's a standup comedy show,

265
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,081
you know,

266
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:10,310
it's a fucking joke.

267
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,470
At least in that sense.

268
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,130
There's no excuse with a rap
music with a rap song like,

269
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:16,281
no,

270
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,000
it's not a joke.

271
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,770
Maybe he's being serious with a movie.

272
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,180
Maybe they trying to
promote that lifestyle.

273
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:20,840
Maybe that's real.

274
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,310
It's a standup comedy show.

275
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,300
The only reason why people are
laughing is because it's a joke.

276
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,661
Well,

277
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,590
people do know that,

278
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:30,830
but it's unfunny people attempting to
influence these people trying to influence

279
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:31,310
what you said.

280
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,210
It's like the same mentality and I don't
mean individually like let's just say

281
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:39,140
the same mentality that would
target dice or that would say,

282
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,830
ah,

283
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,630
you should get in trouble for a gay jug.

284
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,610
I the exact same people who would stand
up and defend Maple Thorpe that the same

285
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,730
people who would defend piss Christ and
say that the national endowment of the

286
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:53,330
arts should have paid for piss Christ
because he'll tell people what that is.

287
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,970
It's it's,

288
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,191
it's,

289
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:54,431
it's,

290
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,990
it's at the NEA and I think paid for,

291
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:59,120
it was an artist who pissed into a jar
and he put a crucifix in it and he called

292
00:07:59,121 --> 00:07:59,954
it piss Christ.

293
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,351
Now,

294
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,090
I don't think that that's
particularly clever,

295
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,800
but it doesn't offend me on any level.

296
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,540
And here's more and consistency.

297
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,010
It's the same people that clever.

298
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:07,500
I mean,

299
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,700
it was,

300
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:07,841
you know,

301
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:08,180
I look,

302
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,013
I wouldn't have mind.

303
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,890
I wish I would have thought of that.

304
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,161
I mean,

305
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:10,401
I just,

306
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,500
I couldn't fill a jar
with my pis has been like,

307
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:12,770
you know,

308
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,550
took weeks.

309
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:13,791
Yeah.

310
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,320
I really would.

311
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
A big jar too.

312
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,213
It's very impressive.

313
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:16,641
Yeah,

314
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:16,971
it's a very,

315
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:18,110
it's a two kegger but,

316
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:18,331
uh,

317
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,011
the fact that he,

318
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:23,510
that they support that and at the same
people who would have attacked Giuliani

319
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,290
for going after the fucking Brooklyn
Museum of art because a guy put African

320
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,140
artists painted a,

321
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,360
the Virgin Mary and Dung,

322
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,540
so they would call him a fascist for that.

323
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,470
Um,

324
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:33,760
you're,

325
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,070
you're,

326
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,460
you're,

327
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,320
you don't understand art
if you're a maple Thorp,

328
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,880
but you don't understand
art if your TAC piss Christ.

329
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:38,510
However,

330
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,680
if you attack a comment,

331
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,770
well that conduct is insensitive
and he's saying something racial,

332
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:43,730
it may actually insensitive or,

333
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,520
or gender attentive and he should be a t.

334
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,790
It's inconsistency.

335
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,060
You can't fucking respect,

336
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:48,470
respected.

337
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,970
You can't acknowledge
any of it with respect.

338
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,290
It's people have to,

339
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,150
you have to leave room for art.

340
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,180
And that sounds ridiculous when you're
talking Dick Jokes or any kind of jokes,

341
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,400
but you have to leave room for
art because that's what it is,

342
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,300
is just an art.

343
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,280
And if you don't appreciate
that style of art,

344
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,300
it's no different than you deciding to
go to a Metallica show and not liking the

345
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:06,721
lyrics,

346
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:06,931
right?

347
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:07,651
If you don't like it,

348
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:08,580
you don't have to like it.

349
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,770
There's Jodie Mitchell is
playing down the block.

350
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:11,401
Go see that.

351
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:11,611
Go,

352
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,240
go,

353
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,580
go see Sheryl crow or
go see Dave Matthews.

354
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,080
There's a lot of variety out there,

355
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,130
but at the end of the day,

356
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:20,250
it's something that someone
creates and when I know says,

357
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:20,671
you know,

358
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,610
I'd like to pick them up by his fucking
ankles and slammed his head into a sink

359
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,930
and you're laughing.

360
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,370
That means he delivered art to
the person who likes that art.

361
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,650
And I feel the same way when I,

362
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,460
when I see,

363
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,731
look,

364
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,260
when I saw dykes or when I saw you,

365
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:34,861
and Austin,

366
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:35,694
same feeling.

367
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,970
I enjoy ridiculous over the top humor.

368
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,511
It's my,

369
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,760
one of my favorite things to watch.

370
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,320
So when someone comes along and says,

371
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,320
you can't do jokes about violence
against children cause it's fucked up.

372
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,670
Yes you can.

373
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,630
Yes you can.

374
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,760
You can it even if your
kid had been killed.

375
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,800
Well unfortunately for you,

376
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,020
this one hit home and it's not fun to you,

377
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,020
but everybody else doesn't have a kid
that was killed by slamming their head

378
00:09:58,021 --> 00:09:58,650
into a sank.

379
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,420
It becomes fun for them and it sucks,

380
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:04,320
but you can't just stop the art
form because it's going to hit you.

381
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,560
And that's one of the things that came
up in the conversation with Lindy,

382
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,100
Lindy,

383
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,641
Lindy West,

384
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,031
Lindy West.

385
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:13,440
Yet one of the things that came up the
conversation with her was that she was

386
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:18,441
talking about rape jokes and meanwhile
she had a photo on her Twitter of Jeff

387
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,380
Goldbloom who is in Deathwish
with an n w who he had enacted,

388
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,350
had really horrific rape
scene at barbaric rapes in,

389
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:28,740
you know,

390
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,311
scary,

391
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:30,120
terrifying,

392
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
no joke.

393
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,280
There was no jokes involved.

394
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,951
There was no hee.

395
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:34,830
He ha ha no double entendres.

396
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,280
And yet an actor doing that in that
piece of art somehow or another is

397
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:45,381
exonerated from the impact and this idea
that you should know that one third of

398
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,900
the audience I think is those,

399
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,210
the current thing they're enjoying
banding about when people talk about,

400
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,100
I shouldn't say they're enjoying,

401
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,950
I don't want to dismiss it,

402
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:57,360
but the people who really believe this
believe that one third of all women have

403
00:10:57,361 --> 00:11:01,650
been either sexually assaulted or raped
and there's people that dispute that and

404
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:04,920
there's a lot of it is based
on a certain study from,

405
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:09,921
I believe it was 1987 and there was a lot
of questions are very controversial in

406
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:10,770
that study.

407
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,880
Like they'd say if you ever had sex
with someone then regretted it or we are

408
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:18,270
recover coerced into having sex
and things along those lines.

409
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,300
They called all of those
rates and so then I think,

410
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:24,210
but I think their findings was like one
in five but now people are saying it's

411
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:26,250
one in three whenever the fuck it is.

412
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,560
The idea that you have to like not,

413
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,870
you have to censor
yourself because of the,

414
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,370
you can choose to,

415
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,510
you can choose to,

416
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:35,010
if that's your style of comedy,

417
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,210
you can choose to,

418
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,970
but for you to get mad at
someone who doesn't choose to,

419
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:39,300
it's like,

420
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,890
Ooh,

421
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,380
you're [inaudible].

422
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,770
This is a slippery slope and I know
people don't think it's a slippery slope

423
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,920
because you think it's all just
about protecting people's feelings,

424
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:48,360
especially victim's feelings.

425
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,220
And I see your point,

426
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,220
but at the end of the day we're going
to have to go over this whole mother

427
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:56,260
fucker with a fine tooth comb.

428
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,190
If you want to do that,

429
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,520
you can't just single out stand up comedy
because it's coming from one person

430
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,360
and not a giant movie where a woman
gets assaulted and beaten or raped or

431
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:04,990
whatever.

432
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,200
I mean all of it has to be looked at.

433
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:07,290
Well,

434
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,710
you have to look at the whole thing.

435
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,160
See I and I also feel like I
give myself the same credit,

436
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:13,930
like give the audience like I really do.

437
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:14,681
And it's like we all say,

438
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:16,720
we want to just just treat people
like you want to be treated well.

439
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:20,380
I treat the audience with the same level
of intellectual respect that I want.

440
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,930
And I went and saw Joan
Rivers and I am not,

441
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,600
it's the edgiest set I've
ever seen a comic do.

442
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,311
And I mean,

443
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:28,090
it's a few years ago at the
cutting room in New York,

444
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,920
she's doing nine 11 jokes.

445
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:33,220
Ai Mean fucking brutal.

446
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,300
And I,

447
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,810
I was,

448
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,291
when I was,

449
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,050
I literally wanted to cry at
the end of it because I'm like,

450
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,810
that is what we should be doing.

451
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,710
It is taking everything
horrible that we experience.

452
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,580
And I mean horrible and making a
roomful of people laugh about it.

453
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,290
And when we walked out of there,

454
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,560
my feelings about nine 11 did not
change my feelings about rape,

455
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,580
my feelings about aids,

456
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,810
not one thing she said made me
value those real experiences.

457
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,170
Less not one thing she said
made me devalue anything,

458
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,320
made me lose respect
for the horror of Nile.

459
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,170
Nothing changed for me other than I was
able to temporarily laugh at something

460
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,310
that I knew was awful.

461
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,450
So why wouldn't I give my audience the
same credit for being able to come to the

462
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,610
conclusion I came to watching Joan Rivers?

463
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,980
Well,

464
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,160
uh,

465
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,541
it to,

466
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,650
to take their argument,

467
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:20,290
it would be because
you haven't been raped,

468
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,700
you haven't been murdered,

469
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,410
he didn't lose loved ones in nine 11.

470
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:28,330
And that what you should be doing by
omitting rape jokes is you should be

471
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:29,890
avoiding triggers.

472
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,750
You get PTSD triggers,

473
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:34,780
avoiding people freaking out and thinking
about the rape while they're out of

474
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,260
comedy show.

475
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,250
Just try and have a good time.

476
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,241
And so their,

477
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:41,590
their opinion is set up entirely to
protect the victims of these crimes.

478
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:42,550
It's not like a person,

479
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:47,290
like you has a certain sensibility
about nine 11 Joan Rivers defies that

480
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:47,951
sensibility,

481
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,240
but does it in a humorous way.

482
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,580
And you walk away with the same
opinions that you had going in.

483
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,440
Cause that's not where really
what you're dealing with,

484
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,050
you'd where you're dealing
with is a victimization crime,

485
00:13:56,051 --> 00:14:00,010
a crime or someone's been dehumanized
and them being in the audience watching

486
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:00,940
you talk about that,

487
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,290
you should be more sensitive than that.

488
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,040
So that's there are there points that
very good argument and a lot of ways my

489
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,510
point back to them would be,

490
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,890
I do understand that.

491
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:09,671
But like I said,

492
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:11,020
whenever I talk about tiger woods,

493
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:11,860
his text messages,

494
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:12,820
I reveal my own,

495
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,080
I talk about my own.

496
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,960
I also talk about things
that have injured me.

497
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,590
I talk about my own suicide attempts
to my own sexual proclivities like so I

498
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,310
include,

499
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,960
well you do you certain things horrible
and things that have affected me and

500
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:26,794
things that haven't,

501
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,520
I don't,

502
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,560
it's not like I exclude things.

503
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,750
And if you break down humor like that,

504
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:32,171
like you said,

505
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,130
fine tooth comb,

506
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,420
every single joke or
90% of the jokes you do,

507
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:39,910
unless you're talking about
balloons are bouncing a ball,

508
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,350
have hurt somebody.

509
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,760
Well he's talking about De,

510
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,601
oh my God,

511
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:44,520
was I drunk driving?

512
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,373
Oh my God,

513
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,270
children being killed
by drunk driving is not.

514
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,450
If we get that literal with humor,

515
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,770
then almost all jokes,

516
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,410
comics towel are,

517
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,220
are going to be up for a,

518
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,960
a careful examination.

519
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,480
And I think Matt and Trey said it too.

520
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,314
They're all okay.

521
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,051
We're none of,

522
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:00,830
it's okay.

523
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,700
I won't make pedophile jokes when Kevin
fucking bacon can't play them in the

524
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,500
woodsmen.

525
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:05,770
I'll,

526
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,770
I won't do gun jokes when fucking
Hollywood can't tell me how bad guns are.

527
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,541
And then they can move.

528
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,290
He called two guns with too,

529
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,820
which I have no objection to,

530
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,580
but then don't fucking preach
to me about guns motherfuckers.

531
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,961
It's like just,

532
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:18,500
you know,

533
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,060
I don't care what you do as an artist,

534
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,470
leave me alone as an artist.

535
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,311
I don't tell you what to do.

536
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:23,031
Don't tell me what to do.

537
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:23,864
That's all it is.

538
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,410
No,

539
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,750
it's your point is dead on.

540
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,673
And it's a,

541
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:27,981
it's,

542
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:29,240
it's a very important point.

543
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:29,541
The,

544
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:29,720
uh,

545
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,950
the idea of censorship.

546
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,130
I can understand that people don't want
someone in the audience to be impacted

547
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:40,880
negatively about you making light of
something that's a horrific crime that

548
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,110
they've suffered from personally.

549
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,030
But that doesn't mean you should stop.

550
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,051
Okay.

551
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:46,700
And it doesn't mean that
you're a dick either.

552
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,410
What it means is you're saying something
that hits them personally and you know,

553
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,690
then maybe you shouldn't
go see Jim Norton.

554
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,610
And that sounds like a
fucked up thing to say.

555
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,590
But really that's,

556
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:56,781
that's,

557
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,520
that's the reality of the situation.

558
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,640
This is what you're
doing is a style of art.

559
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,300
People who don't want to be scared don't
go see the conjuring or the evil dead

560
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:05,751
because they don't like,

561
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:06,590
I don't like horror movies.

562
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,930
How come nobody's trying
to stop horror movies?

563
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,250
People that don't like them don't go to
see them at the same way she'd be with

564
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,480
certain types of humor.

565
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,560
And what's,

566
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,251
when you break it down,

567
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:20,150
what's the worst that can happen
if you see something like,

568
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,670
am I going to talk about something
that they don't shell on law and order

569
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:23,480
constantly?

570
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,841
Jesus,

571
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:24,500
the whole things up.

572
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,940
Fucking rape murder fest.

573
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,560
And we think people like it is a rape or
a murder or some kind of voyeurism and

574
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:34,070
I will acknowledge and honor people's Ah,

575
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,580
ah,

576
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,870
porridge to violence.

577
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,190
When does an accident in the southbound
lane and the traffic in my lane doesn't

578
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,024
slow down.

579
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,750
People slow down to look
because they want to see it.

580
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,030
They want to fucking see it on some level,

581
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:48,350
but they don't admit they want to see it.

582
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:49,880
And I hate their lack of admission.

583
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,361
Well,

584
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:53,210
there's a weird exclusion thing too.

585
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:53,651
If you're,

586
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:56,240
you're discussing rape and
you're not discussing murder,

587
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,290
you know,

588
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,290
if you even have anything that involves
a rape in a tweet or something,

589
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:02,691
you're,

590
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:03,650
you're a piece of shit.

591
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:04,160
Or,

592
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,401
you know,

593
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:04,631
you should,

594
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:05,331
should've had a tour,

595
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:06,620
a trigger warning in there.

596
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:06,801
Like,

597
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,050
this is the attitude that a lot of
people are taking it off this stuff.

598
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,430
But why does it have,

599
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,190
why doesn't anybody have the
same issues about murders?

600
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,840
You can talk about a murder.

601
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,561
You can talk.

602
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,394
I'm like,

603
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,383
no,

604
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,740
it's very rare that people get upset
at murder jokes or murder movies or

605
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,574
anything murder.

606
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,140
But there was a Obama thing
recently where Obama said that,

607
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:27,650
uh,

608
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,260
he could have been
Trayvon Martin and I said,

609
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:30,380
uh,

610
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,460
you know who else he could have been?

611
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,710
It can be the little kid
that got killed by drones,

612
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,790
right?

613
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,120
No,

614
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,750
nobody.

615
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,110
Right.

616
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,060
That's a a,

617
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,311
I mean,

618
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:39,200
it's not really a joke per se,

619
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:39,650
but it's,

620
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,150
it's kind of like blocking him.

621
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:41,800
You know,

622
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,010
it's,

623
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,150
it's mocking the idiocy of this,

624
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,820
but it's also bringing up murder.

625
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,010
It's bringing up people
getting hit with missiles.

626
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,250
No body's exploding.

627
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,290
Why is that image any less
disturbing than the image of rape?

628
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:55,920
Are they,

629
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,350
are they equally disturbing
or they both off the menu?

630
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,420
Or why are we only going
with rape off the menu?

631
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:04,020
How come there's like zero push
to take murder off the menu?

632
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,490
Their argument with BB
King and then again,

633
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:09,710
this is what they would say is because
rape or murder victims or people murder

634
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,270
is that you're not taught
to be silent about murder.

635
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,780
Okay?

636
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,080
You're taught to be silent about rape
and there's a lot of rape victims who are

637
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:17,610
too scared to report the crime.

638
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,040
No one is scared to report
a murder lists a mob thing,

639
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,750
right?

640
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,840
They're saying the perception of
the crime is different and our,

641
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:26,610
there's such a shame with it where
there's not as shame with murder.

642
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:28,170
This is not a shame
with these other things.

643
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,513
And again,

644
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,780
I heard what she said and I
listened to it and I did get it,

645
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,310
but I won't,

646
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,250
I don't do a whole shitload of
jokes on rape victims anyway.

647
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,413
Um,

648
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,370
but if that's the case and it probably
is the case then be for castration of

649
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,900
rape rapists or,

650
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,590
or fight the fact that the recidivism
rate is so high in these fucking pigs

651
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,330
because they're being let out of jail,

652
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,470
like fight that.

653
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:52,740
Yeah,

654
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,240
don't worry about what dump contributing
to a fucking rape culture is nonsense.

655
00:18:57,241 --> 00:19:01,080
And it is to say comedian contributes
to rape culture is simply bullshit.

656
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,490
And it's simplistic thinking.

657
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,200
It's a way of saying I don't like what
you're saying and I don't want you to say

658
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:07,590
it,

659
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,850
but I can't come out with that.

660
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,720
So I have to find a higher reason which
makes it sound like you shouldn't say it

661
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:13,554
for this reason.

662
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:13,681
Well,

663
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,570
even the term rape culture,

664
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,021
you know,

665
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,400
someone of my message bird said,

666
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,870
do they have like meetings?

667
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:19,890
They have a magazine.

668
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:21,120
Like is it really a culture?

669
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,831
Like what do you,

670
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:22,780
what are you talking about?

671
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:24,480
And by calling it that,

672
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:26,340
by defining it in those terms,

673
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,320
calling it rape culture,

674
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,131
you would,

675
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:31,560
you put quotes around
that it starts to be real.

676
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,480
And what,

677
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,470
I don't mean that it's going
to encourage people to rape,

678
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,490
but I mean the idea that there is a
culture that supports rape is going to be

679
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:39,120
real.

680
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,150
It's going to be something that
people dress as if it's real,

681
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,890
regardless of whether or not it is.

682
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,810
Is it real that people rape?

683
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,441
Absolutely,

684
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:47,161
but it is a real,

685
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:48,480
that our culture supports it.

686
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,620
Fuck no man.

687
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,454
Of course,

688
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,913
mom,

689
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,123
son,

690
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,590
oh shit.

691
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,070
Itunes or recording to
server the fuck outta here.

692
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:22,610
Server.
