1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,610
what's hard for people to grasp is
that you don't know what's next.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,721
It's hard,

4
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:07,441
it's scary.

5
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,570
It freaks people out so they seek,

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,510
seek help with pills and booze,

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,130
bullshit and bad relationships and drama
at work and all this nonsense that you

8
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:21,450
just filling up your stupid head with
just to distract yourself from this

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,690
ultimate fascinating existence that we
find ourselves in where we see we have no

10
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:28,770
idea what's coming next.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,620
We don't know what's going on right now
anywhere except what's right in front of

12
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:34,680
us and even then the wheels of perception,

13
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:34,871
they,

14
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:35,170
they,

15
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:35,560
they,

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,150
they eat ebb and flow depending on what
chemicals even deuced into your body or

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:40,310
not.

18
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,230
He smoked a joint or ate
a mushroom or you know,

19
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,580
there's a lot going on here.

20
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:49,050
It's not just as simple as this flat
consciousness that we all agree upon

21
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,670
because I'm not entirely sure that other
people have the same experience that I

22
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,240
do.

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,240
When I look at like some country music
and I look at some TV shows and I look at

24
00:00:59,581 --> 00:00:59,850
some.

25
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,840
I shouldn't even say country music,

26
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:01,800
a lot of pop music.

27
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,720
I actually probably more country
music now than even like hot music,

28
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,181
expensive,

29
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,110
good times in the country,

30
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,270
but I'm a big dwight Yoakam fan.

31
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,400
I like my dog's named Johnny cash.

32
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,320
I like some country music,

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,570
but there's some really
stupid shit out there.

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,613
Why is it?

35
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,210
Is it because they're dumber than me or
are they seeing a different reality is

36
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:21,751
reality?

37
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:22,830
Just like your nose.

38
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,330
Your nose is a nose.

39
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:24,761
My nose,

40
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:25,141
his nose,

41
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,910
but if my nose was on your face,

42
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,211
I'd be like,

43
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,740
what do you do different?

44
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,590
You did something different and
if you put your nose on my face,

45
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,220
you'd be like,

46
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,420
do some gum on your nose.

47
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,500
Looks different or something.

48
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,260
It would be.

49
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,320
We both have a notes.

50
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:37,500
It's very recognizable.

51
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,790
Neither one are distinct.

52
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,900
There's nothing.

53
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,360
You know,

54
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,570
W,

55
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,730
w we don't flatten.

56
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,241
Boxers,

57
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,074
noses or anything.

58
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,100
They're both pretty normal,

59
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,880
but I know my nose and I know your nose.

60
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,000
Your nose isn't my nose.

61
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,610
How do I know the test?

62
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,550
Not like reality.

63
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,420
That reality.

64
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,254
Like what?

65
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,460
What other people see?

66
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:57,900
They're seeing it through a filter
that makes things that suck come in at,

67
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,621
come out there,

68
00:01:58,621 --> 00:01:59,490
but a better shape.

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,980
They have it as a better smell to it.

70
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,840
Things that seemed stupid to you,

71
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,471
to them.

72
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:06,690
It all just fits right
into this neuron and this,

73
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,310
this,

74
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,561
uh,

75
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:07,951
this,

76
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:08,131
uh,

77
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,350
ability to interact with light,

78
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,010
accepts this shape better than that
shape for some strange with orange has

79
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:15,120
always been my favorite color.

80
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,940
Or are you seeing the same color
I am because aren't stupid?

81
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,200
How do you like orange?

82
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,131
Want an orange car?

83
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:20,964
You fucking Weirdo.

84
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,580
But you know what I mean?

85
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:23,940
It's like,

86
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,500
why would you like orange?

87
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,280
Is it a,

88
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,820
is it,

89
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,740
is it a taste thing or is it a taste
thing and your world is different than

90
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:32,230
mine?

91
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,080
I think what you're mentioning
is really one of the key lessons.

92
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,200
What I mentioned it his
pot smoking nonsense

93
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,320
when I was on that,

94
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,213
when I did my,

95
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,420
my last Iowasca trip in Peru and I had
the vision of the ego and that was the

96
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:51,650
secret that he basically gave me his
up flying along with this condor eagle.

97
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,240
And the Eagle says to me,

98
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,870
you know,

99
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,520
you want to know how to see better.

100
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,060
You see through everybody else's eyes and
the there was that everybody has their

101
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,960
own perception and to really
understand what you're going through,

102
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,670
what they're going through and seeing.

103
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:10,450
You have to see what they see
through their lens of perception.

104
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,920
And if you can do that,

105
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,640
you know all a lot of this hate
and a lot of this anger goes away.

106
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,790
What you feel instead can be maybe pity
I feel bad for this human look at the

107
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,390
way the world appears to them.

108
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,170
Look at the way you know that
person is so quick to anger,

109
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:30,490
so quick to hate when really they could
look at the same situation with love and

110
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:31,324
feel happiness.

111
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,770
And so it shifts your,

112
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,270
your kind of opinion on things,

113
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,860
but no doubt about it.

114
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:39,790
We look at things a different way and
the recent studies on epigenetics will

115
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,890
show that you know things.

116
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:44,350
You can change the way things appear,

117
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,600
probably not only on a mental level,

118
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:51,601
but probably a genetic level based on
your epigenetic manipulation of belief in

119
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,150
what you see and I think,

120
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,410
you know,

121
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,240
Bruce Lipton's doing a lot
of good research in that
and that's a really exciting

122
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:58,661
field,

123
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,800
but you know,

124
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,130
just because you have a certain lenses
of perception doesn't mean that that

125
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,410
can't change with your
choices and with your belief.

126
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,511
Yeah,

127
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:06,931
and that,

128
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:08,250
that change would help you.

129
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,000
We want to,

130
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,080
we want to hang on to the way we are
so badly because we don't want to admit

131
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:14,100
that we were ever wrong.

132
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,630
If we met wherever wrong,

133
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:19,710
then we have this reevaluation of the
value of self because the value of self is

134
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:23,300
very important and one of the important
things a lot of people have at the

135
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:24,030
right,

136
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,930
they want to be right.

137
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,830
Like a lot of times you get in an argument
with someone and at a certain point

138
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:29,251
and that you're like,

139
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,084
why are we even.

140
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,380
Why am I upset about this?

141
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:34,680
Like I have nothing to do with this
lizard that lives in fucking the Komodo

142
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:35,071
islands.

143
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:35,904
I have nothing to do with them,

144
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,300
but you're insisting that it lives all
over the place and I'm telling you it

145
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,630
only lives there and it's
fucking zoos and like,

146
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,600
why is this even?

147
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,040
Why is this upsetting?

148
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,390
What is it about this?

149
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,740
What's really going on here?

150
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,533
People,

151
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,430
we develop patterns

152
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,180
and attachments.

153
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,520
Attachments to your attached
to the persona of the guy
who's right about random

154
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,001
facts,

155
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:58,270
you know,

156
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,150
so when you're attached to
that and it gets challenged,

157
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,770
you identify with it.

158
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:03,581
That's part of you.

159
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:08,410
So it's actually threatening a piece
of view which triggers the kind of fear

160
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,160
mechanism.

161
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,320
It's fascinating when you
talk to someone in you.

162
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,850
I'm mean I,

163
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,240
I would never say that I'm
absolutely free of that.

164
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,790
I'm not free of any human emotion,

165
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,550
but I'm,

166
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,490
I'm pretty good at controlling that
impulse and I'm also pretty good at not

167
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,320
being attached to ideas until I've like
really extremely vetted the mount and

168
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,480
also vetted out the opposing idea.

169
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
But I've had conversations with people
where they'll say something and be like,

170
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,900
I had a conversation with this kid
where he was talking about a psychedelic

171
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,720
mushrooms and he disagreed
that he was like very adamant,

172
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:41,381
very smart kid,

173
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:41,831
very young,

174
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,880
probably like maybe 20.

175
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,540
And he was talking to me about how,

176
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:44,820
you know,

177
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,740
I disagree with Terence
Mckenna's stoned mushroom theory.

178
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,281
He goes,

179
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,540
I think it's too simplistic.

180
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:49,830
And it,

181
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,190
it ignores the fact that there's so many
different strange things that are uber

182
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,840
complex all throughout the universe.

183
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,320
You know,

184
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,650
why,

185
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,540
why should we assume that human beings
got this way because of one compound?

186
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,321
And I was like,

187
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,070
you're right,

188
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,530
the fuck do I know I
don't know nothing about.

189
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,160
And he was like,

190
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,820
he goes,

191
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:04,960
oh,

192
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,181
okay.

193
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,014
I can respect that.

194
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,381
I go,

195
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:06,601
yeah,

196
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:06,880
I mean,

197
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,461
what did I do?

198
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:08,730
The research am.

199
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,750
I don't know.

200
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,820
I think it's a good idea.

201
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:15,821
I think the idea is sound because I think
that chimps obviously they think and

202
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:19,610
mushrooms make me think in
a completely unique way.

203
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,650
And I think that if a chimp ate mushrooms,

204
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,150
it'll probably affect the way he thinks.

205
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:23,331
I mean,

206
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,580
it just seems to make sense.

207
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,161
No doubt.

208
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:25,361
I mean,

209
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:26,151
we can see it.

210
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:26,391
I mean,

211
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:27,200
you look at,

212
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,650
you look at the pictures of the dolphins
who are just doing that fucking the

213
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,640
puffer fish toxin.

214
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,350
They're going to the surface and
looking at their reflection at that,

215
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,213
at that point.

216
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
That has to be changing.

217
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,960
Some of the usual usual
pattern is probably fine.

218
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:42,711
Fresh fine fish,

219
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:43,544
let's find fish.

220
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,420
Fuck,

221
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,000
let's talk.

222
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,833
That's fine.

223
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,030
And then all of a sudden they stop
all that and it quiets and they say,

224
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,320
wow,

225
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:51,921
look at me.

226
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:53,150
I'm a fucking dolphin.

227
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,120
And then it's a different pathway that
opens up and that's what happened in

228
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,330
these monkeys to at a certain point,

229
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:03,680
irb humanoids or whatever,

230
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,880
what stage they were.

231
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,750
On a certain point,

232
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,490
they're like,

233
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,550
Woo.

234
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,090
Yeah.
