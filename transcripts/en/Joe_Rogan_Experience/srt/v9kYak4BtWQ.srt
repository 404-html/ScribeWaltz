1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,640
What's hard for people to grasp is
that you don't know what's next.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,721
It's hard,

4
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:07,441
it's scary.

5
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,610
It freaks people out.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,713
So they seek,

7
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,990
they seek help with pills and booze and
bullshit and bad relationships and drama

8
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:18,930
at work and all this nonsense that you
just filling up your stupid head with

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
just to distract herself from
this ultimate fascinating
existence that we find

10
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,850
ourselves in where we,

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,770
we have no idea what's coming next.

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,620
We don't know what's going on right now
anywhere except what's right in front of

13
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:31,801
us.

14
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,680
And even then the wheels of perception,

15
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:34,871
they,

16
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:35,160
they,

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,590
they,

18
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,690
the ebb and flow depending on what
chemicals even deuced into your body,

19
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,230
whether or not he smoked a joint
or ate a mushroom or you know,

20
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,580
there's a lot going on here.

21
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:49,050
It's not just as simple as this flat
consciousness that we all agree upon

22
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,640
because I'm not entirely sure that other
people have the same experience that I

23
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:54,210
do.

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,210
When I look at like some country music
and I look at like some TV shows and I

25
00:00:59,221 --> 00:00:59,851
looked at some,

26
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,840
I shouldn't even say country music,

27
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:01,800
a lot of pop music.

28
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,670
I actually probably like more country
music now than I even like hot music.

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,110
We spent some good times in a country.

30
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,420
I'm a big Dwight Yoakam fan and I,

31
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,400
I like my dog's named Johnny Cash.

32
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,290
I mean I like some country music,

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,570
but there's some really
stupid shit out there.

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,613
Why is it,

35
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,210
is it because they're dumber than me
or they see in a different reality is

36
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:21,751
reality.

37
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:22,860
Just like your nose.

38
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,330
Your nose is a nose.

39
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:24,781
My nose,

40
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:25,141
his nose.

41
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,910
But if my nose was on your face,

42
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,211
I'd be like,

43
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,770
what do you do different?

44
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,920
You did something different and if you
put your nose on my face you'd be like,

45
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,530
does some on your nose looks
different or something?

46
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,251
It would be,

47
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:36,330
we both have a notes.

48
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,500
It's very recognizable.

49
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,820
Neither one are distinct.

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
There's does nothing.

51
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,260
You know,

52
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,220
like w w we don't flatten boxers,

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,073
noses or anything.

54
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,100
They're both pretty normal.

55
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,000
But I know my nose and I know your nose
and I know your nose is in my nose.

56
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,550
How do I know that
that's not like reality,

57
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,420
that reality?

58
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,254
Like what?

59
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,490
What other people see?

60
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:57,900
They're seeing it through a filter
that makes things that suck come in at,

61
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,580
come out the bit a better shape.

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,010
They have a better smell to it.

63
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,840
Things that seems stupid to you,

64
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,441
to them.

65
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,690
It all just fits right
into this neuron and this,

66
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,510
this uh,

67
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,951
this,

68
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:08,131
uh,

69
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,350
ability to interact with light,

70
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,010
accepts this shape better than that
shape for some strange with orange has

71
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:15,120
always been my favorite color.

72
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,560
Are you seeing the same color?

73
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:16,801
I am.

74
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:17,970
Cause Ahrens such stupid.

75
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,170
How do you like orange?

76
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,131
You want an orange car?

77
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:20,964
You fucking Weirdo.

78
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,103
You know?

79
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,580
But you know what I mean?

80
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:23,990
It's like,

81
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,500
why would you like orange?

82
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,251
Is it a,

83
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:26,820
is it,

84
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,710
is it a taste thing or is it a taste
thing and your world is different than

85
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:32,230
mine?

86
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,220
I think what you're mentioning is
really one of the key lessons that,

87
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,230
but I'm mentioning his
pot smoking nonsense.

88
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,401
Well,

89
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,234
I was just telling

90
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,340
when I was on that,

91
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,170
when I did my,

92
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,440
my last Iowasca trip in Peru and I had
the vision of the Eagle and that was the

93
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:52,120
secret that he basically gave me is I'm
flying along with this Condor Eagle and

94
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:53,230
the Eagle says to me,

95
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,890
you know,

96
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,540
you want to know how to see better.

97
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,050
You see through everybody else's eyes and
the there was that everybody has their

98
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,320
own perception.

99
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,960
And to really understand
what you're going through,

100
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,670
what they're going through and seeing,

101
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:10,450
you have to see what they see
through their lens of perception.

102
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,920
And if you can do that,

103
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,371
you know,

104
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:15,670
all a lot of this hate and a
lot of this anger goes away.

105
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,140
What you feel instead can be maybe pity.

106
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,390
I feel bad for this human look at
the way the world appears to them.

107
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,170
Look at the way you know that
person is so quick to anger,

108
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,380
so quick to hate when really you know,

109
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,270
they could look at the same situation
with love and feel happiness.

110
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,800
And so it shifts your,

111
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,300
your kind of opinion on things,

112
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,860
but no doubt about it.

113
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:39,760
We look at things a different way and
the recent studies on epigenetics will

114
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,594
show that,

115
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,380
you know,

116
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,350
things you can change
the way things appear,

117
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:49,180
probably not only on a mental level but
probably a genetic level based on your

118
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,760
epigenetic manipulation of belief.

119
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,091
You know,

120
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:53,200
and what you see.

121
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:53,741
And I,

122
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,220
I think,

123
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,401
you know,

124
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:58,240
Bruce Lipton's doing a lot
of good research in that
and that's a really exciting

125
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:58,661
field.

126
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,800
But you know,

127
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,400
just because you have a certain lens of
perception doesn't mean that that can't

128
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:05,410
change with your choices
and with your belief.

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,481
Yeah.

130
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:08,280
And that that change would help you.

131
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,971
We want to,

132
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:13,170
we want to hang onto the way we are so
badly because we don't want to admit that

133
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,600
we were ever wrong if
we'd met wherever wrong.

134
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:18,510
And then we have this
reevaluation of the value of self.

135
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,460
Cause the value of self is very important.

136
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,070
And one of the important things
a lot of people have said,

137
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,943
they're right.

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,930
They want to be right.

139
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,351
Like,

140
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:28,890
a lot of times you get in an argument
with someone and if a certain point in

141
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:29,251
that you're like,

142
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,084
why are we even,

143
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,380
why am I upset about this?

144
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:34,650
Like I have nothing to do with this
lizard that lives in fucking the Komodo

145
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:35,070
islands.

146
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,910
I have nothing to do with them.

147
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,640
But you're insisting that
it lives all over the place.

148
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:39,211
And I'm telling you,

149
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:41,370
it only lives there and it's fucking zoos.

150
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:41,641
And like,

151
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,630
why is this even,

152
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,040
why is this upsetting?

153
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,390
What is it about this?

154
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,740
What's really going on here?

155
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,241
People,

156
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:48,960
um,

157
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,230
we,

158
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,430
we develop patterns,

159
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,160
you know,

160
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,150
and attachments.

161
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,570
No,

162
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,340
and attachments to your,

163
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:58,000
attached to the persona of the guy
who's right about random facts,

164
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:58,271
you know,

165
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,180
so when you're attached to
that and it gets challenged,

166
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,770
you identify with it,

167
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:03,581
that's part of you.

168
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:06,280
So it's actually
threatening a piece of view,

169
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,030
which triggers the kind of fear mechanism.

170
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,911
It's fascinating.

171
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,350
When you talked to someone in you,

172
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,460
I'm mean,

173
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:12,860
I,

174
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,390
uh,

175
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,240
I would never say that I'm
absolutely free of that.

176
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:16,730
Um,

177
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,270
I'm not free of any human emotion or so,

178
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,350
but,

179
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,740
um,

180
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,660
I'm pretty good at
controlling that impulse.

181
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,520
And I'm also pretty good at not being
attached to ideas until I've like really

182
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:31,510
extremely vetted them out and
also vetted out the opposing idea.

183
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,080
But I've had conversations with people
where they'll say something and be like,

184
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,900
I had a conversation with this kid
where he was talking about a psychedelic

185
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,690
mushrooms and he disagreed
that he was like very adamant,

186
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,381
very smart kid,

187
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:41,831
very young,

188
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,880
probably like maybe 20.

189
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,530
And he was talking to me about how,

190
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:44,771
you know,

191
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:45,960
I disagree with turnips.

192
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:47,770
We can as a stoned mushroom theory.

193
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,281
He goes,

194
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,540
I think it's too simplistic.

195
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:49,841
And it,

196
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:54,190
it ignores the fact that there's so many
different strange things that are Uber

197
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,840
complex all throughout the universe.

198
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,321
You know,

199
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:56,620
why,

200
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,540
why should we assume that human beings
got this way because of one compound?

201
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,321
And I was like,

202
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,154
you're right.

203
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,270
The fuck do I know my,

204
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,530
I don't know nothing about.

205
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,160
And he was like,

206
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,850
he goes,

207
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,001
oh,

208
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:05,181
okay.

209
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,020
I can respect that.

210
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,381
I go,

211
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:06,591
yeah,

212
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:06,851
I mean,

213
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:06,971
what,

214
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:08,120
what did I do the research?

215
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,240
Am I,

216
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,760
I don't know.

217
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,790
I think it's a good idea.

218
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,320
I think the idea is sound,

219
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,030
because I think that chimps,

220
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,890
obviously they think,

221
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,640
and mushrooms make me think
in a completely unique way.

222
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,650
And I think that if a chimp ate mushrooms,

223
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,150
you'll probably affect the way he thinks.

224
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,331
I mean,

225
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,740
it just seems to make sense to me.

226
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:25,161
No doubt.

227
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:25,371
I mean,

228
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,180
we can see it.

229
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,391
I mean,

230
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:27,224
you look at,

231
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,650
you look at the pictures of the dolphins
who are just doing that fucking the

232
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,610
puffer fish toxin.

233
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,120
They're going to the surface
and looking at their reflection,

234
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:35,870
you know,

235
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,351
at that,

236
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:37,184
at that point,

237
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
that has to be changing.

238
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,970
Some of the usual usual
pattern is probably fine,

239
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:42,400
Trish.

240
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,720
Trish,

241
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,400
let's find fish.

242
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,471
Oh,

243
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,140
let's play.

244
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,390
Fuck,

245
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,990
let's talk.

246
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,401
That's fine.

247
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:46,234
Fix Your fucking,

248
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,030
and then all of a sudden they stop
all that and it quiets and they say,

249
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,320
wow,

250
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,951
look at me.

251
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:53,150
I'm a fucking dolphin.

252
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,100
And then it's a different pathway that
opens up and that's what happened to

253
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:03,710
these monkeys to at a certain
point or humanoids or whatever,

254
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,060
what stage they were on.

255
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,110
At certain point they're like,

256
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,550
Ooh,

257
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,050
yeah.
