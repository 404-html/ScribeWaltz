1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,530
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,870
So that's the scene.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,093
I actually,

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:05,770
uh,

5
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,380
you know,

6
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,860
uh,

7
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,590
and when I say where did you get this?

8
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,070
Uh,

9
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,260
Johnny Depp actually
hadn't lived a funny line.

10
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:11,950
He goes,

11
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,850
my dentist.

12
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:13,983
But

13
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,800
it was funny cause he's turns
out he's a very funny guy.

14
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:21,430
But I did say this when I was filming
that scene and it became in my standup,

15
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:23,760
I hate to be corny and do
a story from my standard,

16
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,603
but it is true.

17
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,300
I didn't really know
those guys at well at all.

18
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:29,160
And uh,

19
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:29,681
I go,

20
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:32,110
is anybody in this scene not on probation?

21
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,690
And Johnny Depp's like,

22
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:35,231
what did you do?

23
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:35,561
I go,

24
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:35,921
I said,

25
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:37,060
the tonight show I'm fired.

26
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:37,391
He's like,

27
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:37,721
yeah,

28
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:38,441
why did you do that?

29
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:38,711
I go,

30
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:39,070
I dunno.

31
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:39,970
I thought it was funny.

32
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,620
And then I'm like,

33
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,420
you smashed up that hotel.

34
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,471
He goes,

35
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:44,711
yeah,

36
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:44,991
I go,

37
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:45,700
were you drunk?

38
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,930
And Johnny Depp is funny.

39
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:47,500
He goes,

40
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,311
in my defense,

41
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:49,930
the hotel room made the first move

42
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,330
and this is a true story.

43
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:55,030
Cause then I look over at Paul Reubens
and he's just trying to ignore the

44
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:55,810
conversation.

45
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,441
It wasn't like,

46
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:56,681
Hey,

47
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,191
yeah,

48
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:01,600
I rubbed that is a weird
rock and roll thing,

49
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:02,081
the trash,

50
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:05,740
the hotel room and have
accountants pay for it all.

51
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,080
But I've always felt like during,

52
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,720
there was a period where I
was trashing television shows,

53
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:11,230
you know,

54
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,541
and,

55
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,520
and it was just,

56
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,280
I had the same kind of frustration
and rage and I thought,

57
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:16,000
well,

58
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,470
if I do it at a Holiday Inn,

59
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,161
you know,

60
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:18,671
big deal,

61
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,080
why don't I do it on a TV show?

62
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,430
That's kind of funny at least.

63
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,290
Yeah,

64
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:22,551
I know.

65
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:23,650
That makes no sense to you.

66
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,933
Looking at me

67
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,360
like the RCA victor
dog just staring at me.

68
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,950
I'm going to kind of see your point.

69
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,421
But I don't,

70
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:32,631
I mean,

71
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:34,940
I don't see the point
of doing hotel rooms.

72
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:35,780
I've never understood it.

73
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,030
He just smashing shit and like,

74
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:38,601
what are you doing?

75
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:40,070
That's just out of boredom.

76
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:40,904
But,

77
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,680
but it's so stupid to me,

78
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,230
just so child me,

79
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:48,100
I couldn't do that because I'd be
afraid of waking up people next door.

80
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,443
I'm serious.

81
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,580
Like I have no problems
sending the tonight fire or,

82
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,001
or,

83
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,250
yeah,

84
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,050
or smashing up the ice Sedenio hall show.

85
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:57,020
But the idea of,

86
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,070
I don't want to put
somebody else out to do,

87
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,680
you smashed Arsenio Hall shows too.

88
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,330
What did you do there?

89
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:01,520
Yeah.

90
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
Way crazier than the tonight show.

91
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:03,670
I,

92
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,031
yeah,

93
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:04,331
yeah,

94
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:04,960
yeah.

95
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,430
Cause he got fired,

96
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,000
you know,

97
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,761
because of,

98
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:08,530
uh,

99
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,130
they put Chevy Chase on and
70 markets in front of them.

100
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,200
So paramount kind of fucked him over.

101
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,780
So I went out and I said,

102
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,550
are you really quitting?

103
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,930
Is like the week or two before?

104
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,261
And he goes,

105
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:20,561
yeah.

106
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:20,861
And I go,

107
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:20,981
well,

108
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:22,720
let's not make it easy on them,

109
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:23,111
you know,

110
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:26,230
so I spray painted paramount
sucks on the backdrop.

111
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,350
And then I,

112
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:30,160
uh,

113
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,760
I started throwing the couches into the
audience and the crowd was going crazy.

114
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:33,941
Oh.

115
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:37,960
And then I remember I took a television
set monitor and just threw it and then

116
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:38,471
put my,

117
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:38,950
uh,

118
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,290
put my work boots through the back of it,

119
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,351
Jesus Christ,

120
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:44,860
which is way more expensive than
anything I did on the tonight show.

121
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:45,311
But yeah.

122
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:46,110
So then they,

123
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,620
they like tell Arsenio,

124
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:47,861
like,

125
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:48,311
get him.

126
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:50,950
And so he wrestles me down and
as he's got me on the ground,

127
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:51,251
he goes,

128
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:52,090
thank you man.

129
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,403
Why?

130
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,390
Well,

131
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,490
because it's such a colossal fuck you.

132
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:58,121
And then like,

133
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:58,541
you know,

134
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,750
a week Jay had booked
me on a tonight show,

135
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,111
you know,

136
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:02,730
which,

137
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,810
and he came in the dressing
room and he's like,

138
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,021
you know,

139
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:05,320
don't,

140
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,790
don't smash up to more and stuff.

141
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:07,991
You know,

142
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:10,870
cause cause they were hoping
and I do something fucked up.

143
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,081
No,

144
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,040
I'm not blaming them.

145
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,520
I mean I wasn't asking that
was a bit of the green light.

146
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,811
Oh yeah.

147
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:19,630
I mean I knew that that was on
there to do something screwy but,

148
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,500
but uh,

149
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,961
you know,

150
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:23,790
what made it ours in was
that I actually had the,

151
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,693
the uh,

152
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,690
this uh,

153
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,450
lighter,

154
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,251
a barbecue,

155
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,540
lighter taped to my wrist.

156
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,374
Like I was like,

157
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,390
that's what made it arson.

158
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:31,841
Yeah.

159
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,600
Because it meant that it
was a predetermined yeah,

160
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,171
exactly.

161
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:35,980
Yeah.

162
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,930
It was like a taxi driver,

163
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:38,161
you know,

164
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:40,330
the do you didn't worry about doing,

165
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,240
we worried was he did
that nobody was on fire.

166
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,630
No.

167
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:43,960
I mean,

168
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,900
cause I knew at Burton claim
and the lighter fluid and stuff.

169
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,370
And then I also had a buddy,

170
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:48,821
I said,

171
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,090
you know,

172
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,700
stand next to this fire extinguisher
if it gets out of control.

173
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:52,534
But,

174
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,410
but you know,

175
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,243
uh,

176
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:54,840
I,

177
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,310
I don't mean to make this my hook cause
I've talked about it on another podcast,

178
00:03:58,311 --> 00:03:58,960
but,

179
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
but I guess it's good to clean,

180
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,180
clear the air,

181
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:01,780
you know?

182
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,613
Right.

183
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:02,921
But,

184
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:03,370
um,

185
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:03,701
I don't know.

186
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,560
People think like I was
banned from the tonight show,

187
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:07,510
but they had me on
immediately right after.

188
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,020
And it was,

189
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,800
it always weird.

190
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,730
It was weird,

191
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:12,650
was see is a lot bigger than
I always try to make Aiga.

192
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:12,971
That's it.

193
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:13,750
The little fire.

194
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,710
Jesus Christ.

195
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,350
Well that's cause I'm squirting
lighter fluid right there.

196
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:20,860
Why?

197
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,191
Why,

198
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:22,170
why did you do that?

199
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,130
I love that show to get ready.

200
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,550
And this is like speechless twice now.

201
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,320
He just looking at why

202
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,150
[inaudible]

203
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,250
