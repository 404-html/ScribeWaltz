1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
Turn on the lava lamp.
He knows how to turn it on.

2
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:05,860
Everything.
His name is young Jamie.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,740
Three,
two,

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,350
one.
I'm live with Nick Swardson,

5
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:12,210
former drug dealer.
Tell us your tale.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,550
Tell us your tale of.
Of Youth Gone Wild.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,880
It's a tale of youth gone wild.
Wild.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,470
How many people like broke windows?
Because they heard that song,

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,520
but like wild.
Finally somebody labeled at we use in 

10
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,790
songs could be inspiring in a bad way 
sometimes.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,920
Right?
Get you to do some stupid shit.

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,810
Did you know any people carelessly 
whispered?

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,320
I know fucking careless.
Do how many people woke people up before

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,800
they woke them up?
They were not ready to go.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,750
They weren't planning on going solo cod.
Yeah.

16
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm going to host a lot of fucking 
people this year.

17
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,850
When you stop and think about George 
Michael Prince,

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,790
who is the latest one?
There was some big one in Lincoln Park.

19
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,690
Chester Bennington.
This task faster.

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,190
That was a big one.
And Chris Cornell both in the same way.

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,620
Yeah.
And then he committed suicide on his 

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,390
birthday to birthday do.
Yeah.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,470
That was a really.
That was a weird one,

24
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,710
man,
that guy was 41 on top of the world,

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,220
the lead singer,
one of the biggest rock bands of all 

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,321
time,
but it's hard to say like what caused 

27
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:24,441
him to be so fucked up,
but most people point to he was very 

28
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:26,880
sexually abused when he was a young kid 
and that just,

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,220
he never,
he just never recovered from that.

30
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,300
And then,
you know.

31
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,440
Yeah,
I never knew him,

32
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:36,441
but I had friends that are really close 
to them and they just said he was the 

33
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:36,441
most gentle,
sweet guy.

34
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:39,120
Fucking powerful voicemail.
Shred.

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,970
Powerful.
Yeah.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,990
No,
it's horrible.

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,080
It's so hard for people to understand 
that you could be the lead singer of 

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,470
like,
I mean,

39
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,300
arguably one of the biggest bands of our
generation.

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,530
Yeah.
Giant,

41
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:57,531
huge arena filled up.
There was a photo of him standing on 

42
00:01:57,531 --> 00:02:01,851
stage with no shirt on and this massive 
arena show and everybody had their cell 

43
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,510
phone lights on.
You know,

44
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,070
people do that now instead of lighters.
I was a kid when I was a boy.

45
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,180
We didn't have cell phone.
We burned bodies.

46
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,030
We had fire and we had fucking fire 
hazard,

47
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,560
but he was,
um,

48
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,180
he was standing on stage and I was like,
yeah,

49
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:16,050
that's the photo.
Like,

50
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,160
look at that Shit,
man.

51
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,310
That's no one could ever possibly 
imagine that that guy would not be 

52
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,450
insanely happy.
I mean,

53
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:26,340
look how many people love that guy.
You,

54
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:31,341
you're just getting a tiny fraction of 
the love that guy must've gotten and it 

55
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,200
still wasn't enough.
Yeah.

56
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,520
So hard to understand.
I mean,

57
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:43,521
yeah,
that level of just in her sadness and 

58
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:43,521
darkness.

59
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:43,910
Good Lord.
It's just awful to think of.

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,950
That guy went through to get to that 
point and he had six kids.

61
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,780
Yeah.
So I mean,

62
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:53,781
it's just like,
it had to be so much that even having 

63
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:53,781
kids and being with his kids wasn't 
enough.

64
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,560
Fuck man,
that's a crazy picture though.

65
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,190
That's a sick photo.
Oh,

66
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,810
mine.
All the way up in the rafters.

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,900
Yeah,
I mean that's probably like 30,000

68
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,540
people or something crazy.
Yeah.

69
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,190
Well look at all the people that don't 
have phones.

70
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,140
Yeah.
What's their deal?

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Losers.
Maybe they're just cheap mirror.

72
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,040
They're like,
Ari,

73
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,010
like maybe they just went flip phone.
I can't handle it,

74
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,440
can't handle the APPS.
It's just too much.

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Too much temptation.
Always resisting and he's going to be 

76
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,170
chopping his own.
Would soon are,

77
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,100
he's going to have a.
well,

78
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,340
I guarantee you.
He told me you wanted to buy land and I 

79
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,340
was like,
do you want to like build a house?

80
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,680
He goes,
no,

81
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:32,970
no,
no,

82
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,720
just want to camp there.
I was like,

83
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,760
what?
Buy Land to camp on.

84
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,170
He's going to buy like land,
but he's not going to build a house like

85
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,820
land land or like camping.
He's kids.

86
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,790
Was that.
They were calling it glamping,

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,160
which is camping with them.
It was him.

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,200
Big Jay Oakerson.
Big J posted on his instagram page,

89
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,510
but he loves being outside.
He loves nature.

90
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,650
They just.
I mean,

91
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,540
I get it.
Look if you can camp,

92
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,040
if you really don't need a house,
what do you need?

93
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,650
Do you need a trailer to keep your shit 
in?

94
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,110
Like a trailer to put pots and pans and 
if.

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,150
Yeah,
if you still want shit.

96
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,670
You know what I mean?
You can't,

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,860
can't have posters anymore,
but yeah.

98
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:14,390
No poster template.
Farrah Fawcett on the roof of your tent.

99
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,980
Youth Gone Wild poster up.

100
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,310
Yeah.
How many fucking go camping?

101
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:27,250
Why do you have to like buy that's 
outside camping.

102
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:32,251
If you're.
If you own a plot of land and then 

103
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,310
you're just sleeping on it,
is that technically camping?

104
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:36,130
That's a very good point.
That's sleeping on your land.

105
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,160
That's like if you're hunting and 
there's a fence around the animals and 

106
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,500
you're only on one acre.
Exactly.

107
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,210
Is that really hunting?
Fucking hunting.

108
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:45,160
Just chasing down shit that can't run 
away.

109
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

110
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,740
You're feeling you're not camping.
No.

111
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,530
Bears are going to just wander up by 
your campsite.

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Nope.
That's part of the thrill of being a 

113
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,670
camper.
You're out there for real in the wild.

114
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Yeah.
You can't be on your own little land 

115
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,710
unless your land is huge,
but then if you land it's huge and yet 

116
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:01,960
it's like say if you have like one of 
those ranches in Texas,

117
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,530
you know,
Texas is like something insane.

118
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,280
Amount of Texas is private land.
It's not a lot of public land in Texas.

119
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:13,420
It's just all giant ranches and some of 
them are like 10,000

120
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:18,421
plus acres,
like twenty thousand one hundred 

121
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:21,110
thousand.
Like you could camp there I guess 

122
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,110
because it takes you like three hours to
drive across it.

123
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,420
That's weird.
He had drove to your house.

124
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,870
That's too much land too much,
right?

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,860
It's too much.
Why do you need that much land?

126
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,920
How about Ted Turner?
Doesn't that guy owns the most land of 

127
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,071
anybody in the country here today?
King ranch sprawls 825,000

128
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:41,011
acres of South Texas.
Land an area larger than the state of 

129
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:41,620
Rhode Island.
Oh my gosh.

130
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,010
Are you kidding me?
As the home of 35,000

131
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,750
cattle and over 200 quarter horses,
king ranch,

132
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,890
one of the largest ranches in the world 
today.

133
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,110
I wonder if they hunt on that ranch.
Who?

134
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,080
Which king?
Some fucking baller.

135
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:57,860
He might as well be a case King of Rhode
Island.

136
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:58,640
Burger King.

137
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,150
Maybe it's a burger king guy.
Isn't sane man.

138
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,310
That is insane.
No gay bars.

139
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,220
I get this three or four in there for 
sure.

140
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,210
It would be amazing.
No gay bars,

141
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:16,211
but there's plenty of truck stops.
Rest stops are like where they're at 

142
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:20,110
now.
They haven't really gotten to the full 

143
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,110
on gay bar,
not full admittance.

144
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,890
They just wanted to meet at the rest 
stops when we were kids.

145
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,910
That was like the thing like you'd 
always know.

146
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:27,260
The dudes would try to bang dudes at 
arrest a hundred percent.

147
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Like if you're at a rest stop and 
someone knocks on your door and it's a 

148
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,320
dude.
He's looking to get a blow job.

149
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,730
Just no rest there.
Nobody's resting.

150
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,020
You're wide awake and in your mouth they
figure out to meet at rest up.

151
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:46,340
So I've always wondered like how does 
that work?

152
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,370
CB radio,
breaker breaker one nine.

153
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm looking to suck some Dick.
Anybody out there hollaback?

154
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,980
Sixty nine or 69 or come on and rigor.
Rigor.

155
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:02,981
One night I like to make bathroom smell 
of Shit excites me over.

156
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,960
Was it a senator or whatever the 
politician was.

157
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,170
The gentleman who got arrested in a 
sting operation because so many dudes 

158
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,791
were sucking dicks in the bathroom at 
the airport in Minneapolis where I'm 

159
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,150
from.
Yeah.

160
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,690
Then people called me about it.
I was like,

161
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:24,860
what the fuck?
I don't know.

162
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,580
Hey Man,
what's the airport?

163
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,180
What's the stole?
Was it how many taps?

164
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,220
It'd be so many people that they 
actually went and put a cop there to try

165
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,630
to bus people.
I mean,

166
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:40,631
how many people have to get their dick 
sucked in a place before they hire a 

167
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:41,310
cop?
We found a hotspot.

168
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,640
So here it is.
Senator pleaded guilty reportedly after 

169
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:52,370
bathroom stall incident.
That's Minneapolis St Paul Airport.

170
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,690
Yeah.
And he was,

171
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,820
uh,
he was like tapping on the ground.

172
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,040
They had a way a dad that was a tap 
move.

173
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,630
Yeah.
Okay.

174
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:04,631
What is,
he said at the time of the incident 

175
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:04,631
incident,
I complained to the police.

176
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:08,230
They were misconstrue my actions.
I was not involved in any inappropriate 

177
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,591
conduct.
He said I should have had the advice of 

178
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:11,840
counsel and resolving this matter in 
hindsight,

179
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:16,841
I should not have pled guilty.
I was trying to handle this matter 

180
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:20,441
myself quickly and expeditiously get it.
And I travel wearing tap shoes.

181
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,880
See,
part of me thinks it's hilarious,

182
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,090
but part of me is sad that this guy has 
to like hide what he's into and he has 

183
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,071
to hide in bathroom stalls and learn 
some fucking secret tap and just smell 

184
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:36,080
farts from around the world as he's 
coming.

185
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,230
According to the report cited by roll 
call,

186
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,260
Craig tapped his right foot,
which the officer said he recognized as 

187
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,350
a signal used by persons wishing to 
engage in lewd conduct.

188
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,390
But what if you were there and you just 
tapping your foot?

189
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,420
Yeah.
What if you're just impatient because 

190
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,420
your shit's taking other stuff next.

191
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,380
Oh,
he also then entered the stall next door

192
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:56,910
and block the door with his luggage.
Oh Gee.

193
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,250
What does that.
How does P,

194
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,240
other people get in then?
Oh my God,

195
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:05,241
I was in there with somebody.
He was trying to block anybody from 

196
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:05,241
coming in.
Oh my God.

197
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:08,490
He must've been just going to town on 
guys and then airport.

198
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,490
That was the spot and people are kicking
trying to kick in the door.

199
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,720
What was happening there?
I got it,

200
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,070
but how does it like.
How does a spot become notorious?

201
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,020
Like how does arrested,
what does it say?

202
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,470
Proceeded to swipe his hand under the 
stall divider several times.

203
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,080
I want to know what the fuck was.
The cop was saying,

204
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,340
if he was like,
stop.

205
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,950
I can't do it.
I can't Tuck your tick here.

206
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,090
We don't know what the cop was saying.
The cop was totally leading him on.

207
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,980
I mean it sounded like he had the green 
light.

208
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Unless the guy's a total psychopath.
When you go into a stall with another 

209
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,190
dude and you stack up your luggage in 
front of the door,

210
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,890
that's a bold move.
It's weird.

211
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,950
It seems like you would only do that if 
you were emboldened.

212
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Didn't just tap his foot.
He touched the officer's foot with his 

213
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,000
foot.
He reached his foot all the way under.

214
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,950
Here's my question.
We know cops are full of Shit.

215
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,680
All right.
Just like people.

216
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:02,660
People full shit.
Put cops are people.

217
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,400
Not all cops.
A lot of cops are awesome.

218
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,730
We know some cops are full of shit.
Like when when something like this 

219
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,791
happens,
I feel like that's one person versus 

220
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:12,791
another person.
I don't really feel like a cop's word is

221
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,680
worth more than a regular person's word 
because I think a cop was just a regular

222
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:20,681
person.
I think you should listen to them when 

223
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:20,681
they're doing the job,
but something like this,

224
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:22,610
it might've been exactly as this cop 
described,

225
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,670
but it might've been like that Baltimore
cop that got busted planting drugs with 

226
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,631
his fucking camera had a body camera on,
and what he didn't understand is when 

227
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,741
you turn on a body camera,
it records 30 seconds before you turned 

228
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:39,461
it on,
so just in case you turn it on in a 

229
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:39,461
moment of duress was something crazy is 
going on.

230
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:39,461
You're like,
shit,

231
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:41,840
the camera and you present on vacancy.
Someone committing a crime,

232
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,020
perhaps you have a 32nd buffer.
I didn't know that.

233
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,280
He didn't know that either.
Dude.

234
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,520
So they got on video,
30 seconds of him going back in planting

235
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,320
the drugs that he then pretended to.

236
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,140
Oh fine.
Oh my God.

237
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,360
That's horrifying.
Horrible.

238
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,040
Fucking horrifying,

239
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,120
horrible.
See?

240
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,830
Because if you're gonna be able to 
convict somebody on,

241
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,840
this guy says this and that guy says 
that,

242
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:10,841
and who do you believe?
I believe the copies an officer of the 

243
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:12,911
law.
That's crazy because it's just a person 

244
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:12,911
and this is not a disrespectful thing.
It's cops.

245
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm not,
I'm not a disrespectful person,

246
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,250
but the amount of power is a scary 
amount of power and it's just a person.

247
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,430
Now,
some people like I have a bunch of 

248
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:24,430
friends are cops and they know how to 
handle it.

249
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:24,920
You know,
they've handled it and they've,

250
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,820
they,
they get it,

251
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:27,950
they know what it is and they're real 
cool about it.

252
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,440
Like big John McCarthy,
the ref for the UFC.

253
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,990
He's one of the best examples.
Big John is a.

254
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,050
He was a serious cop in,
involved in some fucking hairy shit for 

255
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,651
years.
One of the nicest guys you ever want to 

256
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:42,290
meet and totally fair and reasonable 
guy.

257
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,320
And he was the guy,
you know,

258
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,690
that was like a bright and shining 
example of what a cop could be.

259
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:51,170
And if the world is filled with big John
McCarthy's as cops,

260
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,460
it'd be a wonderful place and I think we
all figured out,

261
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:55,900
but cops are just people,
men,

262
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,810
especially when these cops are going 
into these situations,

263
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:01,540
like imagine me in a 21 year old guy or 
however the fuck old you are,

264
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,170
and all of a sudden you're working in 
Camden,

265
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,870
New Jersey.
I get the fuck Outta here.

266
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,960
You're not ready for that.
You're saying regular dude and you're 

267
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,291
going to get thrust into some chaotic,
almost semi war zone in some of these 

268
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,180
bad neighborhoods.
These people have to patrol.

269
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,930
Yeah.
And just another world with another set 

270
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,731
of rules and just shit.
Just going down and you're coming up on 

271
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:28,450
is most likely a threat to your life.

272
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,690
You pull a guy over,
like you pulled a guy over in a 65 

273
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,231
impala.
What are the odds that guy doesn't have 

274
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:37,231
a gun,
right?

275
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:38,320
You see like one of them low rider cars 
and you see some,

276
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,350
some gangster look and fellows with some
crazy face tattoos and shit and they're 

277
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,780
driving those cars.
Can you imagine having to pull over 

278
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,610
someone who you knew was probably 
willing to shoot you and you have to 

279
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,631
talk to them about their brake light 
being off or they were five miles an 

280
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:54,631
hour above the speed limit.
You,

281
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:56,920
you know the videos,
you've seen videos of cops getting shot.

282
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:59,170
We have,
you know that that could happen.

283
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,140
You around.
People just lying all the time.

284
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,640
They're all lying.
Yeah.

285
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,800
How many of them are telling the truth?
They talked to you.

286
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,870
Ninety percent fellowship.
Ninety percent.

287
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,960
So every day it's just true

288
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,750
panic.
I mean like when I would get pulled 

289
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,750
over,
I mean like I panicked.

290
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,750
I fucking like,
yeah,

291
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,110
that cop,
that shot,

292
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:21,220
that chick,
the recent one where the woman called in

293
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:22,070
Minnesota.
Yeah.

294
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,120
She called for the police and then she 
came out and when she came out the cops 

295
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,581
shot her.
That to me is the perfect example of why

296
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,380
we should reassess what a cop is and 
reassess like how many people get to be 

297
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:42,601
cops.
It's an extraordinary responsibility 

298
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:45,250
you're putting on just any person,
an ordinary person.

299
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:50,251
I would say.
I think you have to be an extraordinary 

300
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:52,000
person to be a good cop for sure.
You also have to deal with the fact that

301
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,340
there's been a lot of bad cops and 
there's a lot of prejudice against cops.

302
00:13:55,341 --> 00:14:00,341
It was like two giant factors,
but I think that job where you decide 

303
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,520
whether or not you pull the trigger and 
end someone's life and you're a 

304
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,440
panicker.
You know you're a panicker.

305
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,310
You're not a.
you're not a guy who does well in,

306
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:13,311
in confrontational situations.
Maybe you haven't been in a lot of 

307
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:13,311
conflicts.
Maybe you've seen too much shit.

308
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,180
Maybe seen too many people get shot.
Maybe you're suffering from PTSD.

309
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:18,760
Maybe you're on edge all the time.
Maybe you have nightmares that someone's

310
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:23,761
going to take you out and then all 
sudden you're in the hallway and this 

311
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:24,130
lady comes out or an alleyway and shoot 
her and you're like,

312
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,260
what the fuck?
Like you.

313
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,460
You might not even saw her.
You know,

314
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,160
people have hallucinations under great 
duress,

315
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,870
like when they think their life is on 
the line,

316
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,700
they see things that aren't really 
there.

317
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,770
It happens to people all the time.
They'll,

318
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,870
they'll mistake someone for something 
else.

319
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:39,430
The mistake someone for an attacker.

320
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,940
I mean,
that's fucking insane.

321
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,950
I mean she called the cops crazy.
That's what's fucking insane to call 

322
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,341
nine one one because she heard what she 
thought was a woman being assaulted and 

323
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:52,190
then approach a cop car

324
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,150
and they get fucking shot phrasing.
I mean like what?

325
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,480
But it's what it is,
is people not handling pressure very 

326
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,640
well.
Pressure is,

327
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,700
it's.
It is such a massive factor in the way 

328
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,980
people behave and there's no bigger 
pressure than you showing up.

329
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:13,250
You have bright shiny lights.
You're in the enemy car.

330
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Okay.
You were in the NMP enemy uniform and 

331
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,371
they know you have a gun.
And how many of them have watched so 

332
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:24,971
many videos on tv of cops planting 
evidence on Youtube of cops planting 

333
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:28,310
evidence of kids being shot by cops and 
stores were cops got shot in the back.

334
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,340
I mean like crazy shit.
So you're dealing with the weight of 

335
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,860
that when you step out of your car.
Yeah,

336
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:35,690
I mean that's the anxiety.
Twenty four slash seven.

337
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,550
That's a job that is insanely hard to do
and we should,

338
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,520
we should figure out a way to reengineer
that position.

339
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,460
We should figure out a way to give them 
more help,

340
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,130
more support and explain like,
like the,

341
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,940
the only way like cops and civilians are
going to get along is if there's no fuck

342
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:58,790
ups or very,
very few fuck ups.

343
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,710
Like anytime something like this 
happens,

344
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,140
you realize you got to realize like you 
got a bad system.

345
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:05,380
Like the system is.
You can't have just a regular person and

346
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,580
give them a gun kind of psychological 
training.

347
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:09,340
Do they have.
Have you seen what they're.

348
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:10,760
What they're like,
how did they get the Gig?

349
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,320
If you seen what they're like under the 
gun.

350
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,540
Have you seen what they're like when 
someone wants to beat their ass?

351
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,090
Have you seen what they're like when 
someone is throwing punches at him,

352
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,850
trying to kill them?
Some guy randomly,

353
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,920
right?
He answers a call.

354
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:24,680
He opens a door,
guys throwing bombs at them.

355
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,670
How does he,
what does he do?

356
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,380
How does he handle this?
Does he shoot the guy?

357
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:29,240
Does he run away?
Can you fight back?

358
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,930
Has He ever been punched?
Right.

359
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,950
Fuck man.
You're asking some regular person to 

360
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,910
just be involved in it potential like 
civilian warzone on any given day,

361
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:42,911
like if you're in Miami,
Florida and someone gunshots fired in a 

362
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:42,911
warehouse.
So like,

363
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:47,740
what are the odds?
These guys don't have like piles of 

364
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,550
cocaine in his warehouse machine.
I've seen narchos come on,

365
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,660
man.
Well that's the thing.

366
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:52,670
It's like you've never seen a mellow cop
movie.

367
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,150
There was no like,
chill movie where it's like,

368
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:56,780
alright,
yeah,

369
00:16:56,781 --> 00:17:01,781
you got a speeding ticket and then did 
today and then the end is fucking nuts 

370
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:04,790
except smoking the bandit.
It's pretty proven.

371
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:09,400
Then they drove recklessly.
Do nobody around.

372
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,300
Yeah,
I mean nobody to hit.

373
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,560
Right.

374
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,550
I have a question for you.
Okay.

375
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,410
What is this I hear about,
um,

376
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,360
your dream pills?
The pills.

377
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,870
Somebody said that you approached your 
Alpha brain.

378
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,930
It's a nootropic what it is,
it's actually nutrients that are 

379
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,250
building blocks for human 
neurotransmitters,

380
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,730
like certain foods that are called,
or I'm saying foods because you eat 

381
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,170
them.
It's their supplements,

382
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,230
mostly vitamins and minerals and a bunch
of different things that you can get 

383
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,771
from plants and there's a series of 
different kinds of nootropics and if 

384
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:47,990
you've never looked into it,
it's a cool thing to study.

385
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,080
There's actually supplements out there 
that enhance

386
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,670
your memory and they enhance your 
reaction time as well,

387
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,420
like,
well,

388
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,130
you know,
how you feel like if you're hung over or

389
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,540
you wouldn't even understand what this 
is,

390
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,080
such a man of health never drank,
but that feeling where you're like kind 

391
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,140
of foggy,
like cut or some days you just kind of.

392
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,250
It's not firing,
right?

393
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,370
So we know for sure this is really 
obvious to everybody that there's a 

394
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,770
difference in your performance based on 
a variety of factors,

395
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:17,280
right?
Right.

396
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,740
Lack of sleep,
nutrition,

397
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,270
exercise,
stress.

398
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,480
There's a whole host of factors that 
affect how your brain forms nootropics.

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What they can do is boost up your 
brain's ability to remember things like 

400
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,440
verbal memory is a big one that they 
show.

401
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:38,490
And we did two double blind placebo 
controlled studies about Alpha brain.

402
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,530
That's one of the things we found.
We found,

403
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,840
um,
memory reaction time and peak alpha flow

404
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:49,841
state all improvements and all like 
statistically significant improvements 

405
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:49,841
in those areas.

406
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,160
So what I've found is a,
uh,

407
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,570
there was a company called neuro.
One is the supplement.

408
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,570
I forget his company,
but it's Bill Roman,

409
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,190
you know bill very well.
Yeah.

410
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,860
That guy is Jesus.
John Savage,

411
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,200
savage as a football player,
super savage.

412
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,610
And remember we're going to talk about 
the new cte study that just came out.

413
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:13,800
It's crazy with football players,
but anyway,

414
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:18,801
Bill Roman [inaudible],
he used to be friends with this dude 

415
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:19,350
Sarah and no name and no name was,
uh,

416
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:21,330
that were cool radio station in San 
Francisco.

417
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,450
Still love doing them and I'm no name 
was friends with Roman asking 

418
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,270
romanesque.
He was training him.

419
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,370
He was like,
he was like trying to get him in shape.

420
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,170
It's like,
come on you fuck,

421
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,180
I'm going to work you out.
And you put them through a bunch of 

422
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,071
brutal workouts.
And then he gave him some of his 

423
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:37,071
supplement and that's how I found out 
about it.

424
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:41,180
And to supplement neuro one he invented 
because he was suffering from head 

425
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,930
injuries because he had been so many 
concussions,

426
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,931
man,
he's having memory problems and all 

427
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:47,931
sorts of issues.
So he started looking into um,

428
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:52,170
nutritional cures like what,
what helps boost neurotransmitters,

429
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,820
which helps boost serotonin.
There's,

430
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,080
there's like five htp is a big one that 
helps boost serotonin and l trip to fan 

431
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:04,161
as well because El Tryptofan actually 
converts to a five htp and then you have

432
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:09,201
to add in a bunch of other shit like 
adaptogens and b vitamins and all these 

433
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:12,951
different things.
Like there's a combination that you can 

434
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:12,980
hit of,
of nutrients and Bill Romanowski uses.

435
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,540
I think he used a little caffeine in his
as well.

436
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,020
Anything to do with him by the way.
This is not an advertisement.

437
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,330
We don't sell neuro one,
but it's the shit.

438
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,010
It's really good.
And that's,

439
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,450
that's the first thing I found out about
it,

440
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:27,660
found out about that.
And then we wound up making Alpha brain,

441
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,690
which is our version of it with a bunch 
of things at work together 

442
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:32,690
synergistically.
And um,

443
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,050
if you take that stuff before bedtime,
a lot of times you get freaky dreams.

444
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,420
Like if you take it like an hour before 
bedtime,

445
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,190
like right.
It seems to like,

446
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:43,520
right when you go to sleep,
you know,

447
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,600
that's when it's just getting into your 
system.

448
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,220
And I guess when you go into your rem

449
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,340
sleep,
you get an extra fucking fat,

450
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:56,341
juicy pipe of neurotransmitters to work 
when you started having freaky ass 

451
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:57,580
dream.
There's this full inception.

452
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,520
Yeah,
of a Paratha.

453
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:03,190
Tim is really good too.
People love that stuff.

454
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,220
Love that.
Coleen Coleen is a big one.

455
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:09,620
That's one of the ingredients,
the lucky charms.

456
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,190
I definitely am lucky charm.
They should be.

457
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:15,040
People will be like times made me very 
smart today.

458
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,630
They're basically,
you know,

459
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,130
their nutrients.
Yeah.

460
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:18,940
No,
that's a trip.

461
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,520
No,
I was just super skeptical about this.

462
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:23,470
And you definitely should be.
You definitely should be.

463
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I would never ever in a million years 
try to sell someone something that 

464
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,670
doesn't work.
I would have zero desire and doing that.

465
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,060
So everything that we do it on it,
I use.

466
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,040
Yeah,
I use I or I believe in it.

467
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,260
It's like there's nothing.
There's no horseshit thing,

468
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,090
so when this whole new tropics thing 
came out,

469
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,480
we like,
we rushed and Got Alpha brain out and a 

470
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,480
lot of people call bullshit.

471
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,480
They're like,
they're like,

472
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,680
there's no studies.
No science is a snake oil.

473
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,430
I was like,
Oh,

474
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:50,440
you got to have like all your ducks in a
row.

475
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,780
You start claiming that you have 
nutrient regardless of whatever 

476
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,320
anecdotal evidence you have good 
learning,

477
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,710
but I mean that's weird because people 
never just cry bullshit over stuff for 

478
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,850
no reason.
People never just go,

479
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:04,540
what?
No,

480
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,570
fuck that.
It's like everything that.

481
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,080
Everything that happens.
What I saw Katie Perry sitting down with

482
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Deray Mckesson,
mckesson or Mac doesn't have a black 

483
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,760
lives matter and Katy Perry was 
apologizing about cultural appropriation

484
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,090
because I guess she wore braids for 
whatever fucking reason and she was 

485
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,490
sitting there is the weirdest thing 
ever.

486
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:29,290
Man,
they're both on a couch and they have no

487
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,080
shoes on and she's touching him and he's
wearing a blue vest.

488
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:33,760
I was like,
what the fuck am I watching?

489
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,250
Was that in the dream or was that a real
look?

490
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,270
Look,
here's the thing,

491
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,240
dude wears that blue vest everywhere.
I mean,

492
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,610
he loves that blue vest that says,
look,

493
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,620
you know what I'm saying?
It's like Mr Rogers,

494
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,360
Mr Rogers,
first of all,

495
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:47,600
to get the socks.
I love socks.

496
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,330
Strong.
Confident man.

497
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,610
Are they in the Matrix?
Those socks are rainbows,

498
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,180
homie.
What bitch colors there?

499
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:58,510
And so she's culturally appropriating a 
lesbian right now with her hair.

500
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,120
She should be careful.
She's culturally appropriating.

501
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,150
Literally an old lesbian.
She Re hipster an insane asylum that 

502
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,170
there.
And that's her bathroom where she shits 

503
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:10,170
that uh,
that picture on the wall.

504
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,030
It comes down and she climbs on top and 
shits in the mouth.

505
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,850
Oh my,
uh,

506
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,040
yeah.
It's crazy.

507
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,450
It's a new thing.
It's a new thing.

508
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:21,451
All the celebrities are doing like,
look how they're sitting here facing 

509
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:21,451
each other.
It's so bizarre.

510
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:25,890
I can't play any of this because I don't
want to get the video pulled off 

511
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:25,890
youtube.
But uh,

512
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,390
it's mostly,
it's him sitting there listening to her 

513
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,081
just go like this.
Coming out of her barfing,

514
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,290
she just didn't want people to be mad at
her for doing.

515
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,850
For wearing braids.
Yeah,

516
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,910
for for cultural outrage.
Let's see what she looked like when she 

517
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,040
was culturally appropriate and cultural 
appropriation is

518
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,040
so crazy.
The idea that you can't have braids if 

519
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,040
you're white.
Oh my God.

520
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,220
Do people just trying to control people.
They're trying to control people whether

521
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,750
they're fucking two cents.
Everybody wants to throw in and chime 

522
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:00,750
in.
Yeah.

523
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:00,940
It's just everywhere.
Everybody wants to be like,

524
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:01,360
oh no,
no,

525
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:01,670
no,
no.

526
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:02,750
I got.
I have something to say.

527
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:03,410
It's like,
all right,

528
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:08,411
well,
and everybody wants to be able to be 

529
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:08,411
mad.
They want to have a reason to get mad.

530
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:08,411
Yeah.
We talked about that earlier.

531
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:11,510
Everybody wants to be Super Superman.
Yeah.

532
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:16,100
We were talking about the behind the 
scenes stuff at shows and about how many

533
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,190
different mindsets you have to kind of 
manage when you're working on a show and

534
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:24,050
how many people were just looking.
You get outraged about stuff.

535
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,390
Especially lately.
It's so.

536
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,830
It's a weird fucking time for this.
Yeah.

537
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,980
No,
you cannot have choke.

538
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,470
I mean,
I,

539
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,230
I sent out like loose cannon tweets 
sometimes,

540
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:37,040
then I would do it more back in the day 
and then I just liked the more I,

541
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,440
you know,
you get shit faced and then like write a

542
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,340
tweet and I'm like,
I just,

543
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't want to deal with what somehow 
somebody could even.

544
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,300
I mean even like innocuous,
harmless instagrams and stuff,

545
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:50,180
people will still like jump on them and 
be like,

546
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:52,190
Hey,
I saw this bird.

547
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:55,090
And they're like,
well what's the kind of bird is a,

548
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,510
well,
what did you fuck it?

549
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,590
Or I don't know what I mean.
Like,

550
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,410
well you hit it on the brim out.
I decided to it.

551
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,510
Don't you think though that for the most
part,

552
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,180
most of the interactions are pretty 
nice.

553
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,110
There's just a snip of the most.
Yeah,

554
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,330
right.
There's a small but those small 

555
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:12,330
percentage you don't forget.

556
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:12,330
No,
and it's,

557
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,321
it's just,
I mean it's the ones that are really 

558
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:16,321
irrational and the ones that always make
me laugh for people,

559
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:20,501
it'll go like they'll comment or 
something and I don't really read 

560
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:20,990
comments like an uber on a plane or 
something and I'll just like,

561
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,340
oh,
I'll see you check out the comments.

562
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,840
Some will be like,
hey,

563
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:25,220
fuck you,
you're a piece of shit.

564
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:25,970
I'm like,
all right,

565
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,050
like it.
And then they'll come back like,

566
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,710
can't believe you like that.
Like I was just kidding.

567
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:35,711
Like I'm a huge fan and I'm just like,
well this is just weird for me because 

568
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:37,320
you're just sending it.
You just wrote a whole thing about hi,

569
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,760
I'm a piece of shit and I just liked it 
and the night you're like,

570
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,620
Nah,
I just,

571
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,730
I just want to get you to respond.
Yeah.

572
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:48,731
From their perspective,
like that's the best way to get them to 

573
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:48,731
respond.

574
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:49,820
Like that's the best way.
Like that way you know,

575
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:50,630
you'll,
you'll be,

576
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:51,860
you'll have your back up against the 
wall.

577
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,700
Well,
it's like you said,

578
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:57,701
it's like when a lot of this stuff's 
positive and then the ones that pop or 

579
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:58,280
the people that are like,
hey,

580
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:01,370
you're fucking fist sucks.
You know what I mean?

581
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,330
That's so rude.
Which,

582
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:04,430
uh,
does your face does not suck.

583
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,770
It's dce dude,
you're fine.

584
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,090
This fifth.
Listen,

585
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:10,430
there's a lot of people out there with 
some fucked up faces that would kill for

586
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:13,730
your face book.
But no,

587
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:18,731
I was saying about dreams I would have 
like when I would detox from like a 

588
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:21,710
fucking booze extravaganza and I went 
out of dreams.

589
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:26,711
That's why I was intrigued because I 
would have fucking crazy dreams where I 

590
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:26,711
would be.
It would be so lucid.

591
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,880
I went here,
riders on the storm right now I can say 

592
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,150
some stuff that was like a,
like a mixed version elevator on 

593
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,500
mushrooms,
like Dj version.

594
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,620
So you detox detox.
I would have these dreams and there were

595
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,270
so loose.
I'd be like walking around the dream and

596
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,190
I'd be.
And I knew it.

597
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:51,210
No,
I was dreaming and I couldn't wake 

598
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:51,210
myself up and I would try to wake myself
up.

599
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,460
So then I would try to like jump dive 
out of a window to wake myself up or try

600
00:26:55,981 --> 00:27:00,720
to like do something that will like jar 
me awake and then I would do it and then

601
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:05,721
I would wake up and then I would be in 
another fucking dream to not be in my 

602
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:05,721
bedroom.
And I'd be like,

603
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:07,080
Oh,
I'm going to go up and get some water.

604
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,760
And then all of a sudden realize,
oh my God,

605
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,070
I'm still in the dream because this 
isn't the shit on my walls.

606
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,750
And I'd have to wake myself up again.
Fucking gnarly dude.

607
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,690
Like you psyched yourself out in the 
dream.

608
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,380
Wake up like,
Hey,

609
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,160
wake up.
Wake up.

610
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,300
Oh look,
you're awake.

611
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,910
Know who does really just more dream 
your wicks.

612
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,920
Yeah.
So it.

613
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,420
So it was kind of fascinated by that.
It makes you wonder what is real.

614
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,080
If you could live in a perpetual dream,
what's going on there?

615
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,610
You still,
there's something happening.

616
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:38,430
You're experiencing things.
It's things are happening.

617
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,310
Whether you're lying there with your 
eyes closed or not,

618
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,730
there's a bunch of shit that's going on.
A bunch of experiences that your senses 

619
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,890
are taken in that are pretty fucking 
remarkably similar to real life.

620
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,290
Right?
Like that's why it's so crazy because it

621
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,790
feels real.
Right.

622
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:58,791
That's why dreams like especially lucid 
dreams trip you out because it feels 

623
00:27:58,791 --> 00:27:58,950
real.
It feels real.

624
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:01,670
But I liked it like when you dream like 
a really weird dream,

625
00:28:01,671 --> 00:28:06,671
you just accept the reality of like,
like when I remember a drag I'll be 

626
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:07,170
like,
yeah,

627
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:12,171
I just totally was in the stream of just
accepted that I was like riding a 

628
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:12,171
rabbit,
you know what I mean?

629
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:15,750
Like over a fucking skyscraper to like 
Save Katy Perry's face or something.

630
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,370
You know,
we totally accept them.

631
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:18,450
Like what I'm doing.

632
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,890
Look at that fucking beard,
that Fabulous Morrison and people didn't

633
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:24,800
have beards back then either when he 
had.

634
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,840
He grew this beard.
The video is him in a fucking beautiful 

635
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,070
old mustang being a bad motherfucker.

636
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,260
Yeah.
Beards were like considered rogue back 

637
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,260
then.
Oh yeah,

638
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,260
he was.
He was this rogue because it came,

639
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,250
man.
He used to post Dick on stage,

640
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,530
went to jail for it.
He's driving to the Tempe Improv right 

641
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,101
there.
I remember that he was going to go see 

642
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,370
joey.
How do we know

643
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,460
what really goes on when you're asleep 
for eight hours?

644
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,390
How do we know when you're out cold?
When you call you're out,

645
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,420
right?
How the fuck do we know what's actually 

646
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,851
happening?
What's going on in these this dream 

647
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:06,151
states?
Because you only remember a fraction of 

648
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:06,151
the time you're out,
right?

649
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:08,920
There's a fraction of the time would 
have dreams aren't fake.

650
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,220
What if they're just some alternative 
reality that you occasionally 

651
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,451
intermingle with when you're conscious 
or unconscious rather like when you go 

652
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:22,621
into a dream state,
maybe that's just like the shadow of 

653
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:22,960
something that just happened that was 
real.

654
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,170
Maybe you have like these these moments 
that seemed like eight hours to you or 

655
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,981
five hours to you,
but you're really interfacing with some 

656
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:35,310
completely different timeline and some 
completely different reality and the 

657
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:40,681
world is pliable.
It's not locked down like rocks aren't 

658
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:44,041
rocks and water isn't water,
but everything's fluid and changing 

659
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,820
constantly and that's why when you're in
these dreams,

660
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,180
you freak out because all of a sudden 
like the physics of reality are gone to 

661
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,450
Napa and do it.

662
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,700
Maybe there might be a war.
Look,

663
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,730
just the fact that this world exists in 
the state that it exists in this world 

664
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,010
is very,
very bizarre.

665
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,610
If it wasn't real like the.
This reality wasn't real.

666
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:08,500
If we all lived in some sort of a black 
and white print version of life and then

667
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:13,501
you got to experience the life that you 
and I know that students stand up and 

668
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:17,131
being in La and flying and planes and 
using the Internet and experiencing life

669
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,550
in the 21st century in 2017,
you would be like,

670
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,290
this is the craziest psychedelic trip.
If you went to Time Square,

671
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,590
you would never.
You'd never experienced anything like 

672
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:31,750
human culture and you went to Time 
Square.

673
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,990
You would be for wreaking the fuck out.
Yeah,

674
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:36,640
that'd be insane.
It would be insane.

675
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,770
We're just so used to it.
We're so used to it.

676
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,380
We don't realize how bizarre the actual 
world is.

677
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,420
Well,
yeah,

678
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,470
I mean it's possible that these dream 
worlds,

679
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,500
that these are just different worlds 
that you tap into when you conk out 

680
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,850
every night is a different world.
B could be infinite,

681
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,290
could be you're running a series of 
lives like you have multiple lives going

682
00:30:56,291 --> 00:31:01,291
on and your decisions you make in this 
conscious life affect all of them and 

683
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:05,701
maybe you have other lives when you're 
asleep that are conscious when you're 

684
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:09,901
awake,
but much like you're asleep and you 

685
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:10,330
don't remember what the fuck is going on
when they're asleep,

686
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:12,700
they don't remember what the fuck is 
going on and you interface.

687
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,600
You might not just be nick swardson 
stand up comedian.

688
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:20,690
You might be an entity that interfaces 
with multiple different dimensions in 

689
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:23,290
the night and you just don't remember 
it.

690
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,270
Just like you don't remember sleeping 
right?

691
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:30,510
You don't remember dreaming.
You don't remember a lot of shit that 

692
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:30,510
happens when you're conked out for eight
hours,

693
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:30,510
right?

694
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,780
Well,
they probably don't remember.

695
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:34,510
When you're awake and you're,
you're interfacing,

696
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,660
you're not just shutting off like your.
Your brain wants to.

697
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:42,661
Everything needs to shut off so that 
your other self in this other dimension 

698
00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:46,980
can interact and can go about its its 
world and maybe eight hours to it as a 

699
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,120
month or a week to us,
we don't even fucking know.

700
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,870
Maybe that's a huge important part of 
being a person is that other world has 

701
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:56,830
to,
has to coincide with it.

702
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:01,831
Maybe that's why Michael Jackson died 
because they gave him that shit that 

703
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:02,680
knocked him out.
That didn't.

704
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:07,681
You don't dream under that shit.
They would basically put them under 

705
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:09,040
anesthesia every night and he wouldn't 
get to interface with the other world.

706
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,240
Alright.
I gotta go.

707
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,660
No,
you never know.

708
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,560
I'm fascinated.
I'm fascinated by dreams.

709
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,720
They fucking are weird man.
But I mean,

710
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:22,060
yeah,
the.

711
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,020
Maybe they do mean something.
Maybe there's another most likely not.

712
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,840
I mean I'm just covered in spiders and 
screening.

713
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,620
I think that's basically.
Well you can let her roll your workout 

714
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,351
stuff in your dream sometimes,
like you'll experience that workout 

715
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:36,351
stuff,
but I don't.

716
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:38,550
I don't work out every names.
I never go to the gym and dreams.

717
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,340
That's a good.
I've never fucking

718
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,280
ever worked out and in a dream have 
never done that either.

719
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:47,450
That's fucking crazy.
I used to throw kicks in my dreams.

720
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,110
I used to like when I was young,
but especially like girlfriends would 

721
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,450
complain.
I would like twitch.

722
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,430
I would like literally like throw a 
kick.

723
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,190
I remember when bill permit jokes about 
it,

724
00:32:58,191 --> 00:33:03,191
like sounded like a Bruce Bruce 
springsteen song throwing kicks in the 

725
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,780
night.
It was like an old ice house chronicles.

726
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:07,680
We went on a whole rant about it.
That's really interesting.

727
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,130
Springsteen,
a lot of guys have that problem.

728
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:11,470
Like fighters have that problem.
Dude,

729
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,110
my fucking old roommate in New York,
we couldn't wake him up.

730
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:20,140
You had to,
you had to like throw something at them 

731
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,230
from across the room and then hide 
because he.

732
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,380
Because he would wake up in an immediate
Malay.

733
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,730
It was immediately like game time and we
thought we found out the hard way.

734
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,900
We were like,
Hey,

735
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:34,901
wake up.
Then it was just thing they name and it 

736
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:37,811
was just like he would just even take 
him like fucking like 15 seconds to 

737
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:39,830
like,
come back down.

738
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,970
Oh my God.
Yeah,

739
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:43,970
so I dunno what every day.
Alternate every fucking day.

740
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,660
What if an alarm clock woke him up?
He wakes up swinging or no,

741
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,090
that has be a person.
It would have to be a person's.

742
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Why?
Just put an alarm clock next to him 

743
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,100
will.
You couldn't afford it.

744
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,200
We were the alarm clock,
the bloody alarm clock.

745
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:02,260
Some people don't like to be woken up,
man and they get super mad at you and 

746
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,260
the other people just chill like,
Hey,

747
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,710
what's up?
What's going on and why?

748
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,360
You guys waking me up.
Hey man,

749
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,510
where are you naked?
You ever seen someone get knocked out 

750
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:10,670
and they ask questions.
They think like what's going on here?

751
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,620
So it's the weirdest thing.
Like what?

752
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,790
Where,
why are you guys here?

753
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,680
Like why are you guys staring out?
Right?

754
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:18,770
I've seen it before but I've never.
Not in front of me.

755
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,520
Dude,
it's weird.

756
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,940
It's weird to the brain,
the human brain when it gets shut off 

757
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:28,640
and then comes back on.
It's almost like an old windows,

758
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:33,430
95 computer when it reboots and you see 
the das thing right now you see the,

759
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,380
what is that,
that black with a white screen,

760
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:41,410
the boot screen does it dot the dos 
screen and then it would take a long 

761
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:46,211
time to boot up and it'd be all Janky 
and shit and you wouldn't be able to 

762
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,390
click on the Internet yet.
And it was like when you get claimed,

763
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,450
like I imagined football players,
it's the same thing,

764
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,750
but they oftentimes don't remember shit.
They don't remember anything that 

765
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:55,750
happened.

766
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,720
They might not even remember like 
getting into the ring.

767
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,820
They might not remember any of that.
I was gonna say.

768
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:00,740
I mean you've seen so many fighters go 
through it.

769
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:03,710
Do they?
Do they ever remember the knockout?

770
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,820
Some of them do,
yeah.

771
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,430
Some of them remember everything.
They remember seeing like,

772
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,470
oh fuck.
Like that last moment where he's like,

773
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:10,340
he caught me.
Yeah.

774
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,470
And they're just out.
Yeah,

775
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,880
they remember getting hit.
They'll remember what hit them.

776
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,040
Some of them,
some of them don't remember anything.

777
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,540
That's the thing about brain damage.
It's a,

778
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:21,380
it gets completely variable.
It's variable,

779
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:26,381
like there's some guys that just,
they've been knocked out a ton of times 

780
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:27,650
and they're okay.
It's weird.

781
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,570
Like Alistair overeem is a perfect 
example.

782
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,920
He's been knocked out of gang of times 
and he's fine like it.

783
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:35,720
At least he appears to be.
He's very lucid,

784
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,060
very articulate.
I mean he's a,

785
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,580
he's got his composure but after fights 
he doesn't,

786
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,680
you know,
like when you get cracked,

787
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:48,681
like he got knocked out when he fought 
steep Emile church and this is not his 

788
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:52,041
fault and I said after this that I don't
think we should interview with fighters 

789
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:55,341
anymore after they get knocked out 
because he said that he thought that 

790
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:58,191
Steve Bay tapped.
He thought he had the guillotine and 

791
00:35:58,191 --> 00:35:58,191
steepbank tapped.
Right.

792
00:35:58,191 --> 00:36:02,290
So he was saying that in the replay.
So we had to play the replay back 

793
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,180
because we didn't know if he was right.
I'm like,

794
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,120
we'll play it because he was saying this
to me while I was interviewing them.

795
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,400
That's why.
So we played it and you couldn't see the

796
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:13,410
tabby.
I think he believed it was just because 

797
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:13,410
he just got knocked out.
Yeah,

798
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,360
that's not a good idea to interview 
people after they get knocked out.

799
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,420
Terrible idea.
Terrible.

800
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:18,750
And I've thought it before,
but I never,

801
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:19,590
I really,
you know,

802
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,950
I just felt a felt bad,
like I had to play the video because he 

803
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,640
said that it happened.
So if he said that it happened,

804
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:28,950
my job as an interviewer is to play that
video.

805
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,430
I just expected him to say something 
along the lines of,

806
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,930
you know,
I thought I had um,

807
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,600
if you could remember the fight,
I thought I had him,

808
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,850
but he got them.
He got me fair play to him,

809
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:40,020
you know,
the normal stuff.

810
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:41,460
Give them a chance to represent 
themselves.

811
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,010
So when that was going on I was like,
okay,

812
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:45,570
this is not fair.
This is like,

813
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:48,270
he's,
he just got knocked out cold and there's

814
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,130
no way,
like three minutes later.

815
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,150
Yeah,
no way.

816
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:56,151
No Way.
And then everybody gets mad at them for 

817
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:56,151
that.
You know,

818
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:56,151
you can't get mad at someone for that.

819
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,780
It's too weird.
Yeah.

820
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,080
So this study came out today.
I'm Brendan Schaub.

821
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:03,660
Send it to me because he's freaking out.
It said that.

822
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,590
What is it?
Something like 97 percent.

823
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:12,620
Okay.
That they examined 111 former NFL 

824
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,500
players.
Only one didn't have cte.

825
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,210
Wow.
Not only that,

826
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:20,211
they found that 87 percent of people who
play football at any level had cte.

827
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,090
This is what's really crazy.
Men who played football at all levels,

828
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,870
all levels for like.
So I,

829
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,860
I assume that's got to mean like high 
school,

830
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:32,740
including high school.
Well,

831
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,550
yeah.
And who is that guy?

832
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:36,930
Jamie.
We talked about this before.

833
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:39,720
Forgive me for not a football fan.
I liked football,

834
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:43,500
but just don't know enough about it.
Who is that guy that jumped on the car?

835
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,240
Chris Henry was his name.
Yeah.

836
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,570
That guy was young and like a super stud
athlete.

837
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:50,280
Right.
I'd have been like 25,

838
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:51,150
26,
something like that.

839
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,550
When they did an autopsy on him,
they found out he had severe.

840
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:57,690
CTE was like,
this guy's brain is wrecked like pole.

841
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:02,770
See if you could pull that study up 
because people were super shocked 

842
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:02,770
because he was in his prime.
Yeah,

843
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,850
I mean he was in his prime and he was a 
super athlete.

844
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,170
Yeah,
I remember that.

845
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,330
I mean you,
Jamie,

846
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:14,331
you know a lot about football.
What or how much of a bad ass was he a 

847
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:17,580
as far as like top wide receivers.
It wasn't maybe like in the top 10,

848
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:18,540
but yes,
he was.

849
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,380
No,
he was starting.

850
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,480
He was starting to get to come into his 
own man.

851
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,620
He died in a traffic accident,
had chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

852
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,390
Pathi.
I always fucked that up.

853
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,690
And cephalopathy and sap and sap and 
Cephalon hmm.

854
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,700
That's a sense of apathy and Sepa 
Apathy,

855
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,740
right?
Pathi and SEFA law and cephalopathy and 

856
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:40,990
cephalopathy.

857
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,400
Boom.
Oh my God.

858
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:44,260
It's got to be neurosurgeons going crazy
right now.

859
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,390
Shut the fuck up.
You idiot.

860
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,960
You can't even pronounce a word.
A form of degenerative brain damage 

861
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,270
caused by multiple hits to the head at 
the time of his death.

862
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:55,120
According to the scientist had brain 
injury research center,

863
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:58,180
a research center affiliated with West 
Virginia University.

864
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,440
The guy says in quotes,
we would have been very happy if the 

865
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,211
results have been negative,
but multiple areas of Chris Henry's 

866
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:07,720
brain showed cte and then they go into 
details about it.

867
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:11,980
So you gotta think like here's a guy 
who's in his prime 28 years old,

868
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,040
right?
Just bad motherfucker and he's not 

869
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,140
showing any signs of like falling apart 
and he's got ce cte.

870
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,480
It's not scary.
Well,

871
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:24,340
I mean it makes you think too.
I mean I talked about that.

872
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,980
A lot of my friends is I'm a big nfl 
dude,

873
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,150
diehard football fan and we were talking
the other day like does,

874
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,940
does it continue?
I mean like 25 years from now,

875
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,850
the rates for a lot of these guys.
Well,

876
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,480
yeah,
but I'm saying like does the NFL,

877
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:38,920
I mean,
oh I see what you're saying.

878
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:44,130
Does the NFL continue?
I mean at some point these studies and 

879
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:44,710
these things are going to come out and 
it's just gonna be,

880
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,810
you know,
it's horrifying.

881
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:52,110
Better off fighting.
I think you can get knocked out and 

882
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,110
fighting and you definitely get brain 
damage and fighting,

883
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,680
but I think if you become like a mighty 
mouse,

884
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:59,070
like if you get to a skill level that 
very few people get to when you were at 

885
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,230
a super elite skill level,
I think you'd probably take less damage.

886
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,830
It's hard to say because there's been 
some fucking wars with the mighty mouse 

887
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,670
thing might be a bad example because 
he's so fucking good.

888
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,880
A lot of his fights or just mismatches,
you know?

889
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:17,881
It's not like there's another mighty 
mouse out there that's trying to fuck 

890
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:17,881
him.
I'm like someone and not everyone can be

891
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:19,120
the mighty mouse,
you know what I'm saying?

892
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,210
Like it has to be.
There's going to be various levels of 

893
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,990
competency across the board,
but like if you could fight the way that

894
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,550
guy fights,
like he doesn't.

895
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,860
He's not a brawler.
He's not doing anything stupid.

896
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,980
He's not just like biting on his 
mouthpiece and throwing bombs.

897
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,280
He's super technical in his approach.
He's a consummate professional and like 

898
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:43,951
a strategic wizard and how he approaches
interacting with guys who are almost 

899
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:46,110
strategically wizard.
Although that was caught that though I'm

900
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,390
a wizard at all over your tents,
um,

901
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,450
but what he does is just the,
probably the safest way to do it,

902
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,690
the smartest way to do it because he's 
just so competent it,

903
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:57,710
he's not getting hit and he's his,
his,

904
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,820
his tactics are so clever and so 
skillful that he's able to like avoid a 

905
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,900
lot of like big bombs that come his way.
Football players aren't avoiding shit.

906
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,870
Now you're getting hit getting hit.
You're getting hit.

907
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,530
Like there's no mighty mouse in the 
football world,

908
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,820
right?
If you're a linebacker,

909
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,980
you're fucking hitting people or hitting
you.

910
00:41:16,981 --> 00:41:17,730
You're hitting them.

911
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,290
If you're on the line,
you're not.

912
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,340
It's nonstop.
I mean to,

913
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,730
not just that he's not even getting hit 
in the head.

914
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,090
They're saying doing this,
like slamming each other.

915
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,990
That stuff jerks your neck and your head
and all that stuff.

916
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,850
Just the sheer impact.
What are you going to sell the.

917
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,550
They just started this weekend.

918
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,550
This is like the pilot,
what they're calling the American flag 

919
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,861
football leagues.
So there's like some former NFL players 

920
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:44,171
in this.
Why don't they just blow guys on the 

921
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,271
field yet?
I don't know if this is going to be 

922
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:46,271
interesting to know.
Yeah,

923
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:46,820
that's football.
That was depressing.

924
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:51,850
Why'd you show that you can't have that?
No one that guy knows while he's doing 

925
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:51,850
it.
The logo put on figure skating,

926
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,410
figure skating.
We need to get something more manly.

927
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,920
Rhythmic gymnastics.
I liked their helmets or lack thereof 

928
00:41:59,920 --> 00:41:59,920
though.
I like that.

929
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,930
I think that's very smart.
Um,

930
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,910
you know,
we just,

931
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,380
there's a rugby helmets.
Those are rugby helmets,

932
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,400
helmets,
the headgear.

933
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,750
There's more protect your ears and I'll 
be going to help them if they had ground

934
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:13,790
maybe.
I guess maybe a little bit.

935
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,250
I would just wear ear muffs.
They used to have those things in.

936
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,520
When I competed in the taekwondo days,
that guy's got knocked out and one of 

937
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,730
the real horrible things was that they 
get kicked in the head knocked out.

938
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:25,760
They usually out cold and their head 
would bounce off the ground.

939
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,130
So depending upon where the fight was 
taking place,

940
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:33,131
most of the time there was no surface 
like we would fight like on an actual 

941
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:36,941
basketball court.
Like there's a video of me fighting on 

942
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:37,280
an actual basketball court,
you can see the lines on the court,

943
00:42:37,281 --> 00:42:42,281
it's solid wood,
and then you kick a guy and they'd fall 

944
00:42:42,281 --> 00:42:45,110
back in their head,
would bounce off the off the wood and it

945
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:50,111
was terrible.
Like some people got knocked out and it 

946
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:50,111
was horrible.
So they started making.

947
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:54,251
People were first,
it was a head gear that you can just 

948
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:55,400
wear on the back of your head literally 
just to protect you when you get knocked

949
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,840
out so that your head didn't bounce off.

950
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,690
And then some guys,
they started making you.

951
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,920
Some guys voluntarily did it.
He started making you aware of the 

952
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,300
bigger all-inclusive helmet.
So it's a big foam.

953
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:08,270
Protect it around your head,
like the you by football games,

954
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:09,320
like a foam?
No,

955
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,070
it's like a.
You can find it.

956
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:16,150
Pull up a taekwondo head gear.
It's like your face is exposed,

957
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:22,630
but like you have like these things to 
cover your ears and the foam over the 

958
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,560
protects him head Jerry later.
That's what it looks like.

959
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,660
That's exactly what it looks like.
There's an adidas one,

960
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,020
so it's like see how it's got the foam 
around the ears and the foam on the top 

961
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,201
of the head.
Your face is completely exposed and 

962
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:35,201
most.
I don't know what that one is.

963
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:37,470
That's not a Friday the 13th.
The one you had on his.

964
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:39,520
Perfect.
That's a real tech window mass.

965
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,450
The white one or the Red One?
There's an adidas one.

966
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,750
Yeah.
So that's in those are world taekwondo 

967
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,240
federation.
Once some of the International Taekwondo

968
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,500
Federation ones,
those tournaments,

969
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:53,501
a lot of them,
they did a differently and they did the 

970
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:55,310
fucking stuck old school a lot of times.
I remember they still had the,

971
00:43:55,311 --> 00:44:00,311
uh,
the wood floors and there was no head 

972
00:44:00,311 --> 00:44:00,311
gear.
They,

973
00:44:00,311 --> 00:44:01,610
I think they probably change them as 
time goes on,

974
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,980
but they,
um,

975
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,530
those,
those head gears were designed really 

976
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:08,530
mostly to protect you when you got 
knocked out from your head,

977
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:13,481
bounced off the ground.
Then they start making people find on 

978
00:44:13,481 --> 00:44:13,481
pads too.
After a while they changed the flooring.

979
00:44:13,481 --> 00:44:14,020
I mean,
yeah,

980
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,920
heads is key.
Yeah.

981
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,680
It's fucking hard wood.
Yeah.

982
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:21,710
It's been the,
the being I found on the fucking meant a

983
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,410
hockey rink,
a hockey rink that didn't have any water

984
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,930
in it.
They put a tarp down like God,

985
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,670
they put a tarp down.
We fought on concrete.

986
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,010
It was horrible.
Why you put tarp down at that

987
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,060
point?
People get knocked out.

988
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:37,710
Two in one dude who got knocked out.
His eyebrow bounced off the,

989
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:39,270
uh,
off the concrete.

990
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:39,690
Like,
you know,

991
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:44,691
there was basically just like the,
whatever the bottom of a ice skating 

992
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:44,820
rink would be.
You would drink.

993
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:47,010
It was for the bay state games too is a 
big tournament.

994
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,790
It was a big deal because the bay state 
games or the Olympic festival and it was

995
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:54,060
the first time and I think only time 
they ever had taekwondo in it.

996
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,780
If I,
if I were going,

997
00:44:55,781 --> 00:44:57,600
I was going to guess,
I think I was 19,

998
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:59,880
so it was like 86.
So,

999
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:01,290
uh,
these guys,

1000
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:03,960
yeah.
There's one google taekwondo tournament,

1001
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,900
kids on a hardwood floor.
Again,

1002
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,780
see this might be,
it might be a tournament where they spar

1003
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,610
or it might be a tournament where they.
Oh,

1004
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:13,050
that looks like they have headgear on 
the ground,

1005
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:14,550
right?
They have,

1006
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,660
they do,
they have forums turned out that little 

1007
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:19,660
red thing,
right?

1008
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:19,660
Yeah.
Those are head gears.

1009
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,220
What's the bar behind the.
I don't know what the fuck that is.

1010
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,370
Like a float day for a pool.
I don't know what that is.

1011
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,110
That might be,
um,

1012
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,690
a different kind of tournament.
It might be a point tournament.

1013
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,730
I think it's floating,
floating to new.

1014
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,460
It's a new sport that comes to the Dildo
whipping.

1015
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:43,050
So I was uh,
I was thinking about this this past 

1016
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,640
weekend.
I was talking to somebody about that 

1017
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,521
Brown bunny movie.
We've talked about that movie before 

1018
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:51,600
that said Vincent Gallo movie where then
he was a close 78.

1019
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,130
Oh,
you said it perfect.

1020
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:54,540
I've never said it right.
Ever.

1021
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,030
I'm very good at trickle Joe.
Seven.

1022
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:58,030
Yeah,
seven years.

1023
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,710
Yeah.
And we're talking about how that fucked 

1024
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,370
his career for sure.
And probably fucked her career for a few

1025
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,170
years too,
right?

1026
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,970
Yeah.
I mean he was so promising to be a lead 

1027
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,250
Gargoyle,
but he was weird.

1028
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:17,850
Freaky dude freaking fucking out there.
I mean,

1029
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:20,370
like I had friends that were friends 
with them years ago and they're like,

1030
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,000
this dude's just on another planet,
you know what I mean?

1031
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:25,140
Like,
of course.

1032
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:28,170
I mean he got his Dick Sucked in a movie
for real and he got his dick sucked by a

1033
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:30,990
movie star that's not just like getting 
your Dick sucked.

1034
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,390
I mean,
she's had a really good career though.

1035
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,760
She's done a bunch of shit since then.
Yeah,

1036
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:37,500
that was a while ago.
So she,

1037
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,590
um,
I don't,

1038
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,430
I'm out of the loop.
So what was,

1039
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,440
what has she been in fuck?
She's one of those chicks it like pops 

1040
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,921
up and she was on an hbo show,
but she was on big love feel like I 

1041
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:52,251
remember a lot of good indie films,
but I feel like I remember there was 

1042
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:52,980
some bad ass to her in the beginning.
Am I wrong?

1043
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:54,750
She was in kids.
Was there first thing?

1044
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,780
Oh Wow.
She wasn't a movie called three needles.

1045
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,300
That sounds hilarious.
Kids heavy.

1046
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,460
Yeah.
Shattered glass is dope.

1047
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,540
It's just in party monster.
Hold on a second.

1048
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,550
Shit.
Jenny and the girl,

1049
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,160
the main girl,
Jenny and forest gump.

1050
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:13,170
Forrest gump.
Forrest gump.

1051
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:16,320
Fucked her on camera.
I don't remember.

1052
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:21,321
Kids.
I just remember it was a chick that got 

1053
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:21,740
eds.
I think so,

1054
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,970
yeah.
Dude fucks her while she's asleep.

1055
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:24,950
She's like,
don't want to change.

1056
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,380
Just be casper and she's got aids and 
the ideas.

1057
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:29,170
She gave him aids

1058
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:31,940
jokes on you.
Screen writers.

1059
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,460
What was the or what was he telling you?
He was in the wire.

1060
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,640
Everybody's said that I looked like him 
when I was in high school.

1061
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:40,810
I remember that.
I was like,

1062
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:41,800
great.
Click on that.

1063
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:44,110
And what year was that movie?
Boys don't cry.

1064
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,150
American psycho.
She's done some shit dude.

1065
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,370
Yeah,
but when did all that stuff happened?

1066
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:50,810
Like when did the Brown bunny movie 
happen?

1067
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,570
No,
you just back up.

1068
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:55,210
It was right there.
Go back the list bro.

1069
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,170
Right up there.
Yeah,

1070
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:57,280
there it is.
Okay,

1071
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,100
so you got an academy award winning 
movie.

1072
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:01,770
Boys don't cry.
Yeah.

1073
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,490
Then she's like,
time to fuck.

1074
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:08,790
No,
it looks like time to fuck was before 

1075
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:08,790
that.
No,

1076
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:12,050
no Brown bunny.
It's fucking after boys don't cry.

1077
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,910
That's down now it's,
it goes lower.

1078
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,970
I'm going the wrong way.
I was thinking the top was the more 

1079
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:20,970
recent ones.

1080
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:21,340
Wow.
Yeah.

1081
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,570
Yeah.
That's a crazy choice.

1082
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,420
So she's still done a bunch of stuff 
since Brown bunny.

1083
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:31,050
She did Zodiac.
I mean she was willing to be on big 

1084
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,490
love,
but not an agent must be so confused.

1085
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,430
What do you want to do?
He had a real.

1086
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,430
He had a real backlash.
Vincent Gallo,

1087
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:45,030
didn't he?
I mean I think he's one of those like 

1088
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:45,400
self imploding dudes.
I don't think he was ever really like.

1089
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:46,630
He did Buffalo,
66,

1090
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:48,590
which is actually a cool movie.
She,

1091
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:50,860
she never stopped working.
So you go 2003,

1092
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,230
killing it.
Yeah.

1093
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,260
So it didn't impact her negatively.
Maybe did.

1094
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,940
I don't know,
but she still worked.

1095
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,730
But you don't really hear about that 
dude anymore.

1096
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,610
And before that movie he was like a.
He was a big.

1097
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:04,960
He was in Buffalo,
66.

1098
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:05,890
Remember that?
Yeah.

1099
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,810
That's a great fucking movie.
It just said that.

1100
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:08,950
Joe,
did you say that?

1101
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,140
Are you in?
So sorry you're in a dream state.

1102
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:16,170
I was trying to remember.
I was trying to remember what we were 

1103
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:16,170
just talking about.
Yeah.

1104
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:16,480
Buffalo 66 is cool.
Him and reach.

1105
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:18,130
You did.
I didn't hear you say that.

1106
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:23,131
I feel embarrassed.
I wasn't listening to him pray for the 

1107
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:23,890
cardinal sin of conversation.
I was just struggling with my memory.

1108
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,820
It's ironically enough after telling you
about nootropics.

1109
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,460
Yeah,
my four helmet now.

1110
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,170
I did yoga today.
I drained my brain.

1111
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,260
I'm a 15 percent stupider when I do 
yoga.

1112
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,780
I want to get back and doing yoga 15 
percent stupid or in what way?

1113
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,850
For like four or five hours.
Just wrecked.

1114
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,420
Yeah.
Hot Yoga like my brain could God my 

1115
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,060
brain cooks.
I did that once and then uh,

1116
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,860
I was like,
I'll try it.

1117
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:55,861
My sister talked me into it and I was 15
minutes into it and I thought we were 

1118
00:49:55,861 --> 00:49:57,280
done and I was like,
all right.

1119
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,050
And then I got up and I'm like,
we have to be done.

1120
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:00,160
And the woman was like,
no,

1121
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:02,260
we have like another 45 minutes.
I'm like,

1122
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:03,340
well,
you fucking do.

1123
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:03,730
Like,
I,

1124
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,140
like,
I just got out of there.

1125
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,890
It was so intense.
I had done yoga a couple times,

1126
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:10,900
I gotten cocky and it was,
you know,

1127
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:16,050
I really liked yoga,
like kind of center me and show me the 

1128
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:16,050
fuck out,
you know,

1129
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,740
and then I tried the hot shit and it was
just not cool man.

1130
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,710
It was too intense.
It's intense.

1131
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,190
Like you definitely,
I was dizzy and.

1132
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:29,790
But you know what it is dude,
it's not the best if you have to use 

1133
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:29,790
your brain

1134
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:32,360
right afterwards for like really solid,
like three or four hours,

1135
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,310
but it is really good in terms of like 
overall,

1136
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,480
like the overall,
the overall your health and the way you 

1137
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,760
interface with the world.
Way more chilled out if you do it a lot.

1138
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,210
Yeah.
But Shit.

1139
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,880
So you did it and then just immediately 
got in your car and then drove away.

1140
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:55,540
What else do I do?
Stay tent up plot of land.

1141
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,030
Lump.
I should go up in that area.

1142
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:04,420
Yeah.
I took a shower and got the fuck out of 

1143
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:04,420
there.
Got something to eat.

1144
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:04,420
Dinner,
shower.

1145
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,460
I did of course got to sweat.
I think there's something really good 

1146
00:51:09,621 --> 00:51:11,850
for your body though that especially 
that hot one.

1147
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,190
I think that 104 degrees and stretching 
out,

1148
00:51:14,191 --> 00:51:17,150
I just think it makes you more pliable.
Definitely makes you more flexible.

1149
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:22,151
Like when you're doing it,
you can get into positions that you 

1150
00:51:22,151 --> 00:51:22,151
can't get into when you're cold.

1151
00:51:22,151 --> 00:51:25,780
So that means to me like there's some,
there's some sort of a benefit in being 

1152
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,860
like really warm in terms of pliability.
The muscle tissue.

1153
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,270
Yeah,
a hundred percent,

1154
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,030
a hundred percent that settlement 
questions.

1155
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,990
I mean it wouldn't be that popular if it
weren't,

1156
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,900
it didn't have some kind of effect.
Yeah.

1157
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,710
Even like,
you know,

1158
00:51:36,711 --> 00:51:41,711
it's like even like getting in any 
situation when you're cold and 

1159
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:42,050
stretching or trying to do anything 
active at the sucks.

1160
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,040
Sucks.
Yeah.

1161
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,170
Yeah,
yeah.

1162
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:47,180
You can't,
you don't perform at your best when it's

1163
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,860
80 below zero outside.
Yeah.

1164
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:53,861
Like I get a massage the other day and 
it was freezing in the air conditioning 

1165
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:54,680
on and I stopped the guy and I'm like,
what the fuck you doing?

1166
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:56,260
Man?
Was like,

1167
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:57,630
what?
Oh,

1168
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,970
did you try to get some?
No,

1169
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,140
no,
but I was like,

1170
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:02,180
what the fuck man,
like turn this off.

1171
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,960
A friend of mine,
his girlfriend was a misuse at one of 

1172
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,851
those uh,
Burke Williams places or something like 

1173
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:09,851
that,
you know,

1174
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:11,300
might not have been that place,
but it was like a high end spa place and

1175
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:14,010
they had a deal that one of them dudes 
go because he had a,

1176
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,420
he was running a whole prostitution ring
in there where guys would come in 

1177
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:19,970
really.
And it was like a,

1178
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,560
uh,
like a name brand place.

1179
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:22,820
Yeah,
like a legit place.

1180
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:26,540
And he just developed clientele that 
knew that he would suck their Dick,

1181
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:29,570
he'd give you a massage and suck your 
Dick.

1182
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:32,390
Like he just had the market cornered I 
guess.

1183
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,540
I guess it was when,
when he likes sucking Dick and uh,

1184
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,360
he wanted to make some money for 
massages.

1185
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:43,361
So his books were Phil fucking are 
saving up for that land.

1186
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,280
That land is going to pay for itself,
that,

1187
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,880
that land ain't gotta fuck itself.

1188
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,980
Yeah.
So if I can just plug my show.

1189
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:57,230
Typical Rick Season Two already 
canceled.

1190
00:52:57,231 --> 00:52:58,310
I already told you that.
Yeah,

1191
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:03,311
you told me that we were just speaking 
of red glowing relationship with comedy 

1192
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:05,090
central.
At least they gave it a shot.

1193
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,280
How long?
How many episodes did they do before it 

1194
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,131
canceled it?
We did two seasons of six episodes each 

1195
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,560
season.
You can still watch it,

1196
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:20,561
but when it's not going further,
what is it a surprise to you that they 

1197
00:53:20,561 --> 00:53:20,561
canceled it?
No,

1198
00:53:20,561 --> 00:53:21,950
no,
no.

1199
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,810
That we had to show that we wanted to 
do.

1200
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:26,160
We wanted to bring you on to do 
something that was called

1201
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,160
Bro Sasson and it was about a guy who's 
raised by an assassin and then he got 

1202
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:37,461
the assassin.
Dad feels bad that his son never had a 

1203
00:53:37,461 --> 00:53:38,160
real life.
He just grew up in a sas environment,

1204
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:43,161
that jungle,
so he sends them to college and becomes 

1205
00:53:43,161 --> 00:53:43,950
the ultimate Frat dude,
but he moonlights as an assassin still,

1206
00:53:43,951 --> 00:53:45,540
but he's still a frat guy during the 
day.

1207
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:50,620
Oh God.
And that was me when I would sleep in 

1208
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,211
the bed,
in the or in the attic and then I would 

1209
00:53:53,211 --> 00:53:53,211
be an assassin that like on the down low
at night,

1210
00:53:53,211 --> 00:53:57,440
but I was always too high or hung over 
or too drunk and we wanted to you to be 

1211
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,390
one of the guys that would be a 
recurring assassin.

1212
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,020
Dude,
I'm in comedy central.

1213
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,920
Bought it in the room that I wrote the 
script.

1214
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:02,460
Everybody.
It was like,

1215
00:54:02,461 --> 00:54:03,570
this is hilarious.
And they were like,

1216
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:04,800
no.
And then just passed on it.

1217
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:05,820
Whoa.
Yeah.

1218
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:06,380
I was like,
alright,

1219
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,470
cool,
good talk.

1220
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,080
Then I rewrote it for free and they were
like,

1221
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,110
yeah,
we still don't want to do it.

1222
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,180
I'm like,
well why'd you buy it?

1223
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,590
They're like,
I dunno.

1224
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,030
I was like,
cool.

1225
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,560
See you guys later.

1226
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:21,310
Good Talk.
Hello Netflix.

1227
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,500
So our heartbeat and executive.
Imagine some of the bad shows that come 

1228
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:28,840
their way.
They'd probably get so confused,

1229
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,760
you know,
it's probably like bad cops,

1230
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:36,020
like network executives,
like we get mad at them because they 

1231
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,400
fuck shows up or they put in their own 
input.

1232
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:38,740
Or can you imagine how many bad shows 
come their way?

1233
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,020
How many just terrible ones?
Think about the ones that are on the air

1234
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,190
and they're thinking about getting their
job fired.

1235
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,130
The show's going to get canceled.
People are gonna lose money.

1236
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,280
They're going to be out of a job.
They won't be able to pay their 

1237
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:53,280
mortgage.
Like,

1238
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:53,280
fuck,
there's all this pressure on them.

1239
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:53,740
Fuck.
And they're like,

1240
00:54:53,741 --> 00:54:54,400
yeah,
we'll buy it.

1241
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:59,490
We'll buy it.
Nick will have to show why I hate the 

1242
00:54:59,490 --> 00:54:59,490
show.
I hated to.

1243
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:02,750
Sorry Dude,
can I process like these people were on 

1244
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:02,750
adderall.

1245
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,570
They're all tweaking their work.
They're working 10,

1246
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:07,540
12 hours a day and adderall is a lot 
like math.

1247
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,220
If you don't know that folks.
One of the,

1248
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:14,250
one of the key things with people they 
do when they do math is their shit at 

1249
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,001
decision making.
Their decision making turns to shit 

1250
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:18,490
caught.
Two Headline Joe Rogan says,

1251
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:22,420
all network executives are doing meth.
That's how the.

1252
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:27,460
I wish that's how it works on that lane.
I have a buddy of mine who's a writer 

1253
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,160
and he told me everyone's on it.
I said,

1254
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:30,970
really?
He goes,

1255
00:55:30,971 --> 00:55:31,600
yeah,
he goes,

1256
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,520
I just know so many journalists are on 
it.

1257
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,440
So many writers are on it.
They're all on adderall.

1258
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,250
Well especially,
I mean in Los Angeles,

1259
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:41,330
just like in terms of what I've seen 
socially out and about.

1260
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:42,470
I mean,
Holy Shit,

1261
00:55:42,471 --> 00:55:45,920
every chick is on adderall.
It's like fucking nuts.

1262
00:55:45,921 --> 00:55:50,921
I've never.
I've done it once and I was just 

1263
00:55:50,921 --> 00:55:53,411
shitfaced somebody gay man.
Of course I put in my mouth and then I 

1264
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:53,840
just,
I didn't really feel it,

1265
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:58,841
but you know,
it kind of made me a little bit more 

1266
00:55:58,841 --> 00:55:58,841
alert,
like Kinda cookie,

1267
00:55:58,841 --> 00:56:00,590
but it wasn't anything special.
But I have friends that they just,

1268
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:02,000
they take it constantly.

1269
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:02,840
Yeah,
it depends.

1270
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:05,130
I'm sure on the dosage.
It depends on the person,

1271
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:10,610
depends on how you can handle and maybe 
you can maybe some people it's super 

1272
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:10,610
beneficial and they can actually handle 
it.

1273
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:15,560
I'm not saying it's not,
I'm just saying for sure there's some 

1274
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:15,560
abuse going on.
I know people that abused

1275
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,880
certain things are made for a certain 
purpose.

1276
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:23,881
You know what I mean?
Like when you make a pill that helps 

1277
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:24,730
people like focus certain situation Ed 
folks.

1278
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,760
Yeah.
That sounds like you fucking take it 

1279
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,280
coachella with like a bottle of fucking 
fireball.

1280
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,680
That's not why anybody made it.
They weren't like,

1281
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,920
yeah.
This is a pill that you take at a music 

1282
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,740
festival with fireball agreement along 
floor

1283
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:49,040
it again,
the youth gone wild skid row.

1284
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,850
Yeah.
That's good road,

1285
00:56:50,851 --> 00:56:51,680
right?
Isn't it?

1286
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

1287
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:57,050
I try to karaoke skid row once I was a 
fucking horrible mistake.

1288
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:59,090
I try to a karaoke.
That song.

1289
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:04,450
I will remember you yesterday and it 
fucking goes on for like six minutes.

1290
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,980
And I know Larry

1291
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,040
sounds like crying blog.
It was horrible.

1292
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:13,550
I drove by the hotel the other day where
Jamie Lane died.

1293
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:16,940
Do you know Janie Lane?
The lead singer of warrant?

1294
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,450
She's my

1295
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,900
in the hotel right over in woodland 
hills.

1296
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:25,100
How'd he die?
Um,

1297
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,980
vegetables.
Eat too many vegetables.

1298
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:29,410
No Dude.
It was all salads in his house.

1299
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,440
His place was filled to the wall with 
salad.

1300
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,720
Oh my God.
Fucked up man.

1301
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:38,500
He got two healthy.
So healthy drink too much water.

1302
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:43,530
You've heard of that?
People dying from drinking too much 

1303
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:43,530
water like Frat hazings and shit like 
that.

1304
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,190
One.
They have water chugging contest.

1305
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:50,191
Super Bad folks do not do that.
You can get to a state where your body 

1306
00:57:50,191 --> 00:57:52,390
literally can't process all the water 
inside of it and you die.

1307
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:56,610
You can fucking what I eat,
die drinking water.

1308
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:00,070
How does it kill you?
It ruins your Oregon's portion.

1309
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,930
I do not know.
We should find that answer.

1310
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,630
You drown?
That's a good question.

1311
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:08,080
Something happens.
Some sort of toxicity,

1312
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,870
some,
some effect of the water toxicity.

1313
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,460
Sound smart.
When you say toxicity,

1314
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,640
it's a good word to throw in.
If you're in the middle of words.

1315
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:21,090
We're dealing with a lot of issues and 
you know the random toxicity of the 

1316
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:22,390
environment.
Comedy Central.

1317
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,860
Are they going to keep going with this 
is not happening without Ari,

1318
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,280
is that the deals are going to keep it 
on the Arrow season and that's it.

1319
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:35,980
I don't know.
It was a fucking genius idea.

1320
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,700
What to take him off that show?
Yeah,

1321
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,650
so fucking weird.
It's genius.

1322
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,220
What?
Pull them off of.

1323
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,290
I wish we could talk about why it 
happened.

1324
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:52,320
We can't,
I wonder if we can know that he's got a 

1325
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,181
special on Netflix.
I have to ask for permission where the 

1326
00:58:54,181 --> 00:58:55,390
store is ridiculous.
It's hard,

1327
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:56,410
man.
Like I said,

1328
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,440
hard being an executive,
hard being what we call a content 

1329
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:01,440
provider.
Nick,

1330
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,580
I believe you're a content provider.
Got to provide with comedy central.

1331
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,010
But I mean I'm just saying in general,
I don't think it's that hard.

1332
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:09,850
If you have talent that is proven in 
that you trust.

1333
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,840
Like if I a network and you brought me a
show that would for me,

1334
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,810
that would be a 90 percent chance that 
would go to pilot for sure.

1335
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:22,040
Is nicked become executive.
I'm figuring out my career was,

1336
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:27,100
I was uh,
playing the odds before they weren't 90 

1337
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:27,100
slash 10.
It wasn't that good.

1338
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,760
Was it like 50 slash 50?
So I liked the odd.

1339
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:32,780
So do you think you could maybe do that?
My job for me?

1340
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,070
Yeah,
for sure.

1341
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:39,420
Yes.
I will sign up for corporate America 

1342
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,220
executive Bro.
Could you imagine if decided like,

1343
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,530
I don't like to show us your pick and 
I'm going to be one of you.

1344
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,470
I have not thought about doing that 
because I hear it.

1345
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,970
I have so many friends.
We all,

1346
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,160
we're all from the same talent pool of 
comedians and writers and suffer like 

1347
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:53,390
everybody has stories where it's like,
guy,

1348
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:54,110
I pitched this.
I'm like,

1349
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:55,380
that's fucking hilarious.
So like,

1350
00:59:55,381 --> 00:59:56,870
yeah,
it's fucking.

1351
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,590
They were like,
no,

1352
00:59:57,591 --> 00:59:59,690
I don't get it.
Well why don't you just start doing shit

1353
00:59:59,691 --> 01:00:04,691
on your own?
Because like you did with Simon Rex in 

1354
01:00:04,691 --> 01:00:07,451
particular.
I feel like you guys could easily do 

1355
01:00:07,451 --> 01:00:07,451
that on your own and put it on youtube 
and I bet it wouldn't be giant.

1356
01:00:07,451 --> 01:00:12,130
We could.
I mean we're going to try to shop it 

1357
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:12,130
around to a couple of other networks and
why get involved with,

1358
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:12,350
with other people?

1359
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:17,370
Well,
because I already have established 

1360
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,821
contents.
We already have two seasons and it's 

1361
01:00:18,821 --> 01:00:18,821
already there.
So we just need somebody to go like,

1362
01:00:18,821 --> 01:00:19,640
yeah,
we get it.

1363
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,920
What do you own it?
Like you can bring it somewhere else.

1364
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,450
Yeah,
because it's just through streaming,

1365
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:23,810
which,
you know,

1366
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:28,670
comedy central is obviously like cool 
enough that to give us that and then all

1367
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:31,070
the executives got fired.
So.

1368
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,220
Because one well done not because 
they're like,

1369
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:36,650
what the fuck did you give him?
Jesus Christ,

1370
01:00:36,651 --> 01:00:40,380
you just going to check it away.
It's going to go on vacation.

1371
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:45,430
Have you heard about his dreams?
He's a lucky man.

1372
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,210
He's kind of crazy,
man.

1373
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:48,840
Yeah,
man.

1374
01:00:48,841 --> 01:00:50,000
You got to do it yourself.
You know,

1375
01:00:50,001 --> 01:00:51,110
it's not their fault.
Even.

1376
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,800
It's like counting on them to know what 
the fuck they're doing.

1377
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:56,020
They know what the fuck they're dealing 
with.

1378
01:00:56,021 --> 01:00:58,940
A really be a TV executive.
Who wants to do that?

1379
01:00:58,941 --> 01:01:02,300
How many people want to do that?
They might think they want to do it,

1380
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,370
but once you realize like the stress 
involved,

1381
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,760
fuck all that man.
It doesn't seem that complicated though,

1382
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,770
right?
I don't think so.

1383
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:12,400
I mean if you have people that,
you know,

1384
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,840
someone could bring you Seinfeld and 
friends and you know,

1385
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:21,800
the whatever name some other show brings
some big ass frazier,

1386
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,690
some big ass sitcoms.
Cheers.

1387
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:25,460
Cheers.
Perfect example.

1388
01:01:25,461 --> 01:01:28,530
And you look like a goddamn genius.
He's the guy that got chairs in the air.

1389
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:31,070
Whoa.
But you could've just got lucky.

1390
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,280
They could have brought you the fucking 
sex in the city or the single guy or a 

1391
01:01:36,411 --> 01:01:41,411
lot of sitcoms and everybody forgot.
They could have brought you a lot of 

1392
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:41,411
bulk toilet.
The musical.

1393
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:45,500
There was a lot of Bads,
coach,

1394
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,610
you know,
remember coach like coach the fuck up.

1395
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,950
Fuck is wrong with you man.
My bad,

1396
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,540
bad experience.
Well that's you.

1397
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:58,541
That's don't put that on coach.
The guy who was a writer for that show 

1398
01:01:58,541 --> 01:01:59,900
on a Sitcom I did.
It was like whoa.

1399
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:03,500
He just acted up,
backed it up.

1400
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,080
Just swing.
And with the old double edge,

1401
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,930
broadsword chop shop

1402
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,400
I would say.
But that's a different conversation.

1403
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:16,420
Have a network,
major neck and like in one of those 

1404
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:16,420
main,
like NBC,

1405
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:16,830
CBS,
like that's so arbitrary on what's going

1406
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,630
to be a hit.
Yeah.

1407
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,990
But what they bring you like is your.
I mean

1408
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,160
obviously I'm come the town pool of 
talented people.

1409
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,300
Yeah,
for sure.

1410
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,480
But even talented people occasionally 
create turds

1411
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,680
of course.
Right.

1412
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:31,390
So if you're a crap shoot,
I'm not saying that.

1413
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:34,830
I'm saying there's different levels of 
like what could you know,

1414
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,840
what's got a better chance?
Like if you bring something with a 

1415
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:39,840
vision and it's really,
you know,

1416
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,750
like you're,
you're passionate about it.

1417
01:02:40,751 --> 01:02:41,680
I would go,
okay,

1418
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:46,000
joe is bringing me this impassioned idea
that I think is funny.

1419
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:47,980
I'll give them a pilot.
That's the thing is about

1420
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:53,050
shows.
This is a really hard part about shows 

1421
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,070
you're developing,
you're developing them while you're 

1422
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,030
presenting them.
So like the show starts out,

1423
01:02:56,031 --> 01:02:58,100
it's a new show.
You're trying to develop the characters,

1424
01:02:58,101 --> 01:03:03,101
you develop,
the way they interact each other while 

1425
01:03:03,101 --> 01:03:03,101
you're putting it on the air,
like you creating any,

1426
01:03:03,101 --> 01:03:03,980
putting on the air.
Like as time goes on,

1427
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,850
things get like you saw like Seinfeld,
like in the later years or friends.

1428
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:10,150
A perfect example.
Everybody knew the characters.

1429
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:15,160
Everybody just flowed together.
You knew even though there were a new 

1430
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:15,860
scripts,
like the thing was so established,

1431
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:18,140
like what was funny about it and how it 
worked.

1432
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,440
When you're creating a new shell,
they're always like fire and peeling 

1433
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:23,440
that Kevin James Show.
Like they're,

1434
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,550
they're like,
they change out the swap out the wife,

1435
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,800
like they did it on bewitched.
Get her out and bring a new one in and 

1436
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:30,800
you need a black neighbor and be like,
okay,

1437
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,130
you need a gay friend.
And then like,

1438
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,470
you know when,
when it's not working,

1439
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,050
everybody wants to throw their fucking 
ges into the soup mix.

1440
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:41,051
Like I know the perfect thing this is 
missing and that's what happens with 

1441
01:03:41,661 --> 01:03:42,680
those shows.
Right?

1442
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:47,710
They all just get looped.
They just get all these different 

1443
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:47,710
opinions until they take out like South 
Park,

1444
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:48,950
they don't listen to shit.

1445
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:54,280
They'll listen to anything.
But that's my point is that if you 

1446
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:54,800
comment,
major networks is different.

1447
01:03:54,801 --> 01:03:57,080
Like the cable networks,
they have a little bit more leeway where

1448
01:03:57,081 --> 01:03:58,430
it's like,
you know,

1449
01:03:58,431 --> 01:04:00,550
if somebody comes in with,
if,

1450
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:05,710
if talent comes in with a strong idea 
and a strong script and a strong vision 

1451
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:10,391
and stuff like that,
I think that's different with networks 

1452
01:04:10,391 --> 01:04:10,391
you're getting,
you know,

1453
01:04:10,391 --> 01:04:13,850
a bunch of major show runners with an 
idea and you know,

1454
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:16,520
they're trying to fit into a formula 
that's different.

1455
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,670
It's still hard.
It's still hard,

1456
01:04:19,671 --> 01:04:24,671
but it's,
I'm just saying there's different 

1457
01:04:24,671 --> 01:04:24,671
percentages of it.
Yeah,

1458
01:04:24,671 --> 01:04:24,671
no,
for sure.

1459
01:04:24,671 --> 01:04:24,671
I mean,
South Park came in and they were like,

1460
01:04:24,671 --> 01:04:25,550
I mean,
I remember stories where they were like,

1461
01:04:25,551 --> 01:04:27,380
they didn't get any notes.
They were like,

1462
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,880
they don't even live here.
I don't think.

1463
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:30,530
I think they live in Colorado or 
something.

1464
01:04:30,531 --> 01:04:31,130
They were just like,
yeah,

1465
01:04:31,131 --> 01:04:33,220
well we're gonna make this show and just
like,

1466
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:38,230
stay the fuck away.
That's probably a good move from 

1467
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:41,831
evergreen.
It was like one of my favorite places 

1468
01:04:41,831 --> 01:04:41,831
ever.
Did you ever see the

1469
01:04:41,831 --> 01:04:42,200
original one?
What would Brian Boitano do?

1470
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,070
Yeah,
of course.

1471
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:48,190
That is,
that's how they got started and that is 

1472
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,501
to this day,
like one of the funniest fucking thing 

1473
01:04:50,501 --> 01:04:50,501
I've ever seen in my life.
When someone gave him,

1474
01:04:50,501 --> 01:04:53,090
he was actually a girl I was dating.
She was an agent's assistant and she got

1475
01:04:53,091 --> 01:04:55,410
a vhs copy of it and she,
uh,

1476
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,460
she brought it over my house and we 
watched together.

1477
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,660
We were fucking crying,
just falling on the ground crying.

1478
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:01,580
He was so silly.

1479
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:03,710
And Jesus versus Santa.
Yeah.

1480
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,690
That was insane.
I didn't say thing.

1481
01:05:05,691 --> 01:05:08,790
I got the vhs tape in like 1996.
I'm to say.

1482
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:11,570
That's exactly what it,
that's the time somewhere around there.

1483
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,640
And I had that vhs and I would watch it.
I was like,

1484
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:15,110
what?
This is insane.

1485
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,850
It was amazing.
So,

1486
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:17,910
and

1487
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,400
it's kind of funny because it's much 
more shitty animation and drawing even 

1488
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,240
in the current one,
which is crazy hard to believe,

1489
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,620
you know,
you watch it.

1490
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:31,621
It's like you're watching like ancient,
like ancient cave art of Jesus or 

1491
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:33,460
something.
You know what I mean?

1492
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:38,461
It's like,
it's weird when you're seeing this old 

1493
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:40,711
way they used to draw everybody in 
comparisons to the new voices are so 

1494
01:05:40,711 --> 01:05:40,870
good.
Oh,

1495
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:41,680
he's amazing.
Yeah,

1496
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,790
they're genius.
Those guys are amazing.

1497
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,480
Trey Parker did the voice in this new,
um,

1498
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,210
what was the fucking animated show that 
I watched?

1499
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:54,810
He did the voice of someone then to 
despicable me and that's what it is.

1500
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,630
Despicable me realize.
Yeah.

1501
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,170
Yeah.
I saw it with my kids.

1502
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:01,080
It's hilarious.
Those despicable me.

1503
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,940
Really good.
Even if you're in a full grown adult,

1504
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:06,490
they are fucking fun movies.
My kids love them,

1505
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,290
but I actually love them.

1506
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,270
They're fun.
Those movies are good,

1507
01:06:10,271 --> 01:06:11,650
man.
You saw the third one,

1508
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:15,400
I saw them all.
I've seen the first two have kids,

1509
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:16,740
Bro.
I seen him multiple times.

1510
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,280
Hold her kids.
I saw underwear,

1511
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:20,050
man.
Oh yeah.

1512
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,540
Captain underpants or something like 
that.

1513
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:26,170
And if they want underwear,
man show called captain underpants.

1514
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:28,630
Yeah,
as a they made a movie out of it.

1515
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:30,160
I'm probably not going to see that by 
myself.

1516
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:33,790
That'd be super weird because some guys 
just watching captain and they make good

1517
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:38,791
fucking kids movies today.
Those despicable me movies are good 

1518
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:38,791
movies.
Yeah,

1519
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:38,791
they're really.
Well.

1520
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:43,330
The third one holds up.
Third One holds up.

1521
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:46,090
My bistronic is one.
A lot of people don't like the minions.

1522
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:48,700
One of those little fuckers like they 
need.

1523
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:50,950
The other guy grew to balance out 
demands.

1524
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,330
Yeah.
You can't just have the minions.

1525
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:55,920
Minions went rogue because it's just all
these fucking assholes.

1526
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,610
People didn't like it.
I found it.

1527
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,380
I think it was good.
I enjoyed it.

1528
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,140
I found it entertaining.
Fuck them.

1529
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,330
Fuck them Indians.
Well,

1530
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,920
like toy story,
toy story three.

1531
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:07,840
It was like one of the best movies I've 
ever seen.

1532
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:09,040
I started crying.
Yeah,

1533
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,060
it was good.
Yeah,

1534
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,500
I wept.
Yeah.

1535
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:15,100
There were some dark moments when the 
teddy bears trying to fucking throw them

1536
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:17,710
into the incinerator.
That was intense.

1537
01:07:17,711 --> 01:07:19,390
Intense Shit.
Lots of air.

1538
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:24,450
Lots of.
Have you ever see babe the pep talking 

1539
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,230
pig moving.
Did you ever see babe pig in the city?

1540
01:07:26,231 --> 01:07:30,700
Part Two?
I don't think I see that movie.

1541
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,660
They decided to take the talking pig,
like broad farm movie.

1542
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:38,020
Throw them in the city where some of the
dogs are prostitutes.

1543
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,160
It goes so fucking rogue.
It's amazing.

1544
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:44,680
You'll love it.
I'll text you and remind you.

1545
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,290
Oh my God.

1546
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:50,300
A pig in the city and there was a big 
outrage because it was so like 

1547
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,120
aggressive and weirdly.
It's super dark and trippy.

1548
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,160
Whoa.
Big P there.

1549
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,290
Prostitute dogs.
I swear to God.

1550
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:59,860
That's one of the hooker dogs and the 
pink.

1551
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,900
That is hilarious.
Got that Harlot.

1552
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,000
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

1553
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,100
Weirder dogs,
man.

1554
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,680
They used to be wolves.
They scare the shit out of me.

1555
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:10,960
I figured out a way to turn them into 
that and have them live with us.

1556
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,760
I think about that when I'm around my 
dog because my.

1557
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:15,980
I got a new dog recently,
seven months old

1558
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,980
now.
I got him a few months back and he's a 

1559
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:21,300
golden retriever.
Okay.

1560
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:25,220
It is the least wolf like dog that has 
ever existed on the planet.

1561
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,190
This dog has like zero aggression in 
him.

1562
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:32,150
Like even when he play fights,
like play,

1563
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:34,940
fight with another dog,
just like zero threat of anybody getting

1564
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:36,810
hurt.
It's like there's the,

1565
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:42,010
the mellowest comments and you gotta 
think like somehow or another people 

1566
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:47,051
figured out how to take a wolf and 
slowly whittle it down until you make 

1567
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:47,260
that.
Right.

1568
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,490
Like what?
What was he eating?

1569
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,520
They probably gave him some weird 
fucking shit and messed with his brain 

1570
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:54,530
denial.
It's just breeding.

1571
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:57,260
They figured out a way where,
I mean,

1572
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,440
I think that life is crazy pliable and 
where you have the best chance of 

1573
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:02,510
success.
I mean,

1574
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:07,511
obviously this is not my theory,
but where life has the best chance of 

1575
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:08,570
success,
it kind of molds itself to that.

1576
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:12,980
Whether it's by putting people in colder
climates,

1577
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:17,981
making their skin lighter so they get 
more vitamin D because there's no sun 

1578
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:21,761
out.
So you're saying it's atmosphere 

1579
01:09:21,761 --> 01:09:21,761
related.
Could be,

1580
01:09:21,761 --> 01:09:24,580
yeah,
and the atmosphere of a dog is the only 

1581
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:24,580
way that dog got food.
It had to be super cool with people,

1582
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:29,110
so the dogs that were cool with people 
are the ones that stuck around and they 

1583
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:30,170
kept breeding and breeding and the ones 
that are the coolest with the people,

1584
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:32,780
the ones who got fed and the other one's
got shot and killed and he didn't get to

1585
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:37,781
breed,
so it's always like the ones that are 

1586
01:09:37,781 --> 01:09:39,681
the coolest with the people that got 
closer and closer to the campfire and 

1587
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:40,490
they get the scraps thrown their way.
It was a sweet deal.

1588
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:45,700
You Bark and they.
They're cool with you and they give you 

1589
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,341
free food and you keep the fucking 
wolves and the bears from eating them 

1590
01:09:48,341 --> 01:09:48,341
and you bark,
bark,

1591
01:09:48,341 --> 01:09:49,070
bark when anything comes and they can be
alert.

1592
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:54,070
That was the whole deal with people and 
wolves and dogs and so they figured out 

1593
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:58,151
a way over countless generations to turn
that wolf into this fucking dog like 

1594
01:09:58,151 --> 01:10:00,980
into a poodle.
Like they figured out how to do that and

1595
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:03,770
it's just life adapts.
It.

1596
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:08,771
Find some weird ways through and next 
thing you know you're holding a French 

1597
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:09,470
bulldog.
Like what the fuck?

1598
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:13,160
That used to be a wolf.
A wolf got whittled down to.

1599
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,200
I'm not.
No disrespect to French bulldogs.

1600
01:10:15,201 --> 01:10:16,700
They're adorable.
I love those little dogs,

1601
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,950
but it's like,
how the fuck did that even happen?

1602
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:20,840
Yeah.
You never see like stone,

1603
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:23,450
like cave drawings.
The poodles that didn't exist.

1604
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,810
It literally couldn't exist with perfect
pum pum,

1605
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,840
like ankles and shit.
You know what they found out about dogs,

1606
01:10:29,841 --> 01:10:32,300
it's really fucked up,
is that all of them came from wolves.

1607
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,720
They thought there was like that.

1608
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:37,220
Like dogs came from like a bunch of 
different wild canids,

1609
01:10:37,221 --> 01:10:42,221
you know,
a bunch of different like African dogs 

1610
01:10:42,221 --> 01:10:42,221
and different dog.
Nope.

1611
01:10:42,221 --> 01:10:42,221
Nope.
All of them came from wolves.

1612
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:43,940
All of them.
That's super weird,

1613
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:48,970
dude.
Well then a wolf like fucked a frog or 

1614
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:50,690
something because there's no way a 
fucking bulldog just comes from a wolf.

1615
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:55,780
It does.
Slowly but surely over thousands of 

1616
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,840
years,
they turn a wolf into a bulldog.

1617
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:59,240
Nuts.
Are we going to go back to wolves?

1618
01:10:59,241 --> 01:11:02,390
Do you think we could turn into Jello 
for sure.

1619
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:07,660
We could turn into some cube like thing 
that sits in a hard form that we carry 

1620
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:11,561
around.
If people found out human and you can't 

1621
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:13,481
break your bones if you don't have any,
you can move things telekinetically now 

1622
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:13,980
and everyone's going to fit into this 
fucking cube and we

1623
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,020
just would be this square thing with no 
bones.

1624
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:21,021
Just slops right into this just 
indestructable plastic barrier that you 

1625
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:23,550
carry around in life until you wanted to
fuck.

1626
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:28,820
And then when you wanted to fuck,
you guys would get close to the bed and 

1627
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:29,520
then you would just ooze out on top of 
each other.

1628
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:32,530
You would like open your doors together 
and just ooze on top of each other.

1629
01:11:32,531 --> 01:11:36,440
That's my entire family in Arkansas that
you just described to that zip pills.

1630
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:39,630
It's everything else.
Got Them skittles.

1631
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:45,820
I don't try.
Dogs scare me because the dog bit my 

1632
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:45,820
balls.
When I was a kid,

1633
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:50,360
I was playing with a ball in my front 
yard and I'll never forget it and I 

1634
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,211
rounded third and a dog lashed out and 
punctured my scrotum and I ran into the 

1635
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:57,090
house and I pulled my pants down and my 
mom started screaming and I just sit,

1636
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,770
so dogs have always to this day,
every time I walk past the dog,

1637
01:12:01,771 --> 01:12:03,330
I'm horrified,
dude,

1638
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:04,200
Dude.

1639
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,760
Yeah,
not cool.

1640
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,160
That ain't cool.
Maybe I won't be Jello Guy.

1641
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:09,600
Yeah,
for sure.

1642
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:13,500
No worry about it's better path and 
getting bitten then nuts by a dog.

1643
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,110
Yeah.
If you have no Oregon's okay.

1644
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:21,200
Nothing can break down.
You're just a giant hive of tissue and 

1645
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,180
everything now is a dream,
but it's a dream that you can control.

1646
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:27,030
They've gotten to the point where you 
don't need a physical structure.

1647
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:29,820
You don't need skulls and Oregon's and 
livers,

1648
01:12:29,821 --> 01:12:33,930
all that stuff is handled exogenously.
They bring in things.

1649
01:12:33,931 --> 01:12:38,460
They bring in like these connections,
these tubes that link up to you and then

1650
01:12:38,461 --> 01:12:41,730
slowly our bodies devolved to the point.
We don't have Oregon's anymore.

1651
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:46,731
We rely on all our organ functions to be
handled outside of the body by machines 

1652
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:51,111
because it's way more efficient and 
allows you to stay in the dream state 

1653
01:12:51,111 --> 01:12:51,111
and control your life.

1654
01:12:51,111 --> 01:12:52,220
Do you have eyes?
No,

1655
01:12:52,221 --> 01:12:53,370
dude.
There's no need.

1656
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:58,280
You see way better and the dream state,
you have a mass of cells that somehow or

1657
01:12:58,281 --> 01:13:01,830
another contains consciousness that 
interfaces with the dream state.

1658
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,630
Twenty four slash seven.
Can I wear a hat?

1659
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:05,580
You can,
but it doesn't matter.

1660
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:08,950
You don't have a head like a hat on the 
table.

1661
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,980
That'd be a Jello shot.
You can,

1662
01:13:10,981 --> 01:13:12,840
but you know,
not a lot of juice there.

1663
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:17,870
You want to be a big fat tube,
like a garbage dumpster filled with 

1664
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,040
cells.
The more cells,

1665
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:22,980
maybe you have the more horsepower in 
the dream dimension,

1666
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,480
right?
That's how to make sense,

1667
01:13:24,481 --> 01:13:29,481
right?
Obviously what we're definitely 

1668
01:13:29,481 --> 01:13:29,940
devolving,
right?

1669
01:13:29,941 --> 01:13:34,260
If you go from like if you look at other
primates,

1670
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:38,640
like primitive primates and you'll get a
rang of tens and gorillas and they would

1671
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:41,100
fuck us up.
We're so weak compared to them.

1672
01:13:41,101 --> 01:13:46,101
Right?
So if you were obviously like the 

1673
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:47,700
weakest by far of all the primates,
other than like little tiny monkeys.

1674
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,840
Yeah,
for sure.

1675
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:54,020
So by far our bodies have gotten weaker 
and dozier and less capable and like our

1676
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:58,050
tendons are not the same.
They are so much stronger than us.

1677
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:03,350
So there's something that's happening to
our body was getting smolder and softer 

1678
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,290
and weaker and they've a plant based 
diet,

1679
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:09,390
just even gorillas,
chimps eat the fuck out of everything 

1680
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:09,390
though.
They eat it,

1681
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,190
they're more closer to us.
They're horrifying.

1682
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:11,980
That story about

1683
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,980
the guy who brought his chimp birthday 
cake and the monkey attacked him and 

1684
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,380
then bit his nose off his fingers and 
ripped his penis off.

1685
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,790
Yeah,
bite his fingers off.

1686
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,220
But it's fingers did his fingers up and 
his nose.

1687
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,000
You know the story?
Yeah.

1688
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:27,670
The toward space apart.
He was jealous.

1689
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:32,930
The chimp that attacked him was jealous 
because he brought a birthday cake to a 

1690
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,851
chimp that used to be his.
See the chimp used to be his and he 

1691
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:37,510
would say the worst is that it?
Is that the story?

1692
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:42,810
The chimp used to be his and he brought 
the chimp to a sanctuary when it got 

1693
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:43,330
older,
because as they get older,

1694
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,880
they get super sketchy.
They start biting people's fingers.

1695
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:51,930
No,
they get super aggressive and the 

1696
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:52,090
consequences of them being aggressive or
so ferocious.

1697
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:53,980
Don't,
don't show me any pictures,

1698
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:55,480
please.
Andi want to see it,

1699
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,300
so he had to give up the champion.

1700
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:59,770
The chimp loved him still.
So you'd go visit him on his birthday.

1701
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:01,540
He brought him a cake with the other 
chimps,

1702
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:06,541
saw the data and get a cake and someone 
fucked up and left some doors open and 

1703
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:08,500
the chimps opened the doors and just 
fucked him up because he didn't give him

1704
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:10,960
a cake.
That's all it was because he didn't give

1705
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:15,961
him a cake.
They tore his fingers off the towards 

1706
01:15:15,961 --> 01:15:15,961
Dickoff just because they didn't give 
him a cake.

1707
01:15:15,961 --> 01:15:18,750
Was that the idea?
Was it because of the character?

1708
01:15:18,751 --> 01:15:20,020
Was it the fire?
No.

1709
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:21,040
Fairness.
No,

1710
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:21,240
no,
no.

1711
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,280
It was a fairness issue.
They were jealous that he gave the cake 

1712
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,611
to the one champion.
They didn't get any cake and they were 

1713
01:15:29,611 --> 01:15:31,591
fucking furious.
And you're also dealing with these 

1714
01:15:31,591 --> 01:15:34,621
chimps that are contained in this 
artificial environment that our freedom 

1715
01:15:34,621 --> 01:15:38,000
and they want to lash out anyway,
and they directly associate people with 

1716
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:39,310
being their captors.

1717
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:44,880
You know,
the people are the ones that keep them 

1718
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:44,880
in there.
The people,

1719
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:44,880
the ones that feed on the people,
the ones that control them.

1720
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,640
And then if they can get out and fuck 
up,

1721
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,350
the person doesn't give him a birthday 
cake.

1722
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:51,190
Yeah.
Feel like the worst aspects of people.

1723
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,990
Magnified Times.
100.

1724
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:54,760
Like you'd see it right in front of us.
Like,

1725
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:56,080
yeah,
this is what we used to be.

1726
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:00,370
This is how we got to 2017.
You have to be fucking ferocious.

1727
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:01,750
You couldn't be like,
hey man,

1728
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:03,670
I'm just here to be like one with the 
animals.

1729
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:05,920
Back in the days of like living with 
Jaguars and shit.

1730
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,470
You had to Russia,
you had to,

1731
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,180
you had to literally.
Yeah,

1732
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:15,181
it was live or die.
So when we think of like what we're 

1733
01:16:15,181 --> 01:16:16,810
becoming,
we're obviously becoming more passive.

1734
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:21,340
We're becoming more better able to deal 
with,

1735
01:16:21,341 --> 01:16:22,690
uh,
interacting with each other,

1736
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:24,990
without violence and that all that.

1737
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:28,600
All that stuff makes us mushier all of 
it.

1738
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:30,790
Is this making more?
It's not even a week.

1739
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:35,200
It's just like physically not,
not attuned to violence.

1740
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,590
Right?
So for physically not attuned to vote,

1741
01:16:37,591 --> 01:16:39,550
why do we need all the strength?
Like why do you,

1742
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,380
why do you need to be so fast?
If I was trying to kill you,

1743
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:43,300
you don't.
You sit in a cubicle all day.

1744
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:47,770
So everything just starts to just like a
bulldog their face.

1745
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,070
Somehow they figured out to make the 
face.

1746
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:52,060
I'll flat or whole body's going to do 
that,

1747
01:16:52,061 --> 01:16:53,650
man,
I'm going to just flatten out.

1748
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,340
So,
uh,

1749
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:56,260
and then our body's going to absorb the 
bones.

1750
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:59,950
Once we start like encasing ourselves 
and we'd go back to the Jello.

1751
01:16:59,951 --> 01:17:00,700
Paypal.
Yeah.

1752
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:02,680
You realize you don't even need food.
You work like a,

1753
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,560
like a plant.
You have this,

1754
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:09,460
this box that contains you and it uses 
photosynthesis.

1755
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,500
Fuel your cells don't like water and 
shit.

1756
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:14,480
Just like soil.
He needs some soil.

1757
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,610
You're going to put some soil below.
You're going to be a plant.

1758
01:17:16,611 --> 01:17:20,270
You're going to go back to plants.
Fuck plants in the Matrix.

1759
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,760
Like in a week now I'll take a while.
Alright,

1760
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:24,260
good.
100 million years or so.

1761
01:17:24,261 --> 01:17:29,261
It will definitely be like some sort of 
a gigantic organism connected to some,

1762
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:35,140
probably some natural internet.
You know what they'll do with their 

1763
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,841
figure,
they'll get to a point where they're 

1764
01:17:37,841 --> 01:17:37,841
like,
you know what,

1765
01:17:37,841 --> 01:17:39,671
this regular Internet is too unreliable.
We're constantly relying on these 

1766
01:17:39,671 --> 01:17:40,160
cables.
I have a new idea.

1767
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:45,190
Here's my new idea.
We are going to make an internet by 

1768
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:47,660
going into all these plants and 
genetically engineering them and turning

1769
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:52,661
them into Wifi towers.
So everything is a wifi tower and this 

1770
01:17:52,661 --> 01:17:56,681
is the new Internet.
They're all connected with each other 

1771
01:17:56,681 --> 01:17:57,380
and you through using a computer or a 
cell phone or whatever,

1772
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,930
you're interfacing with nature now.

1773
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,250
You're no longer interfacing with some 
artificial servers and the verizon,

1774
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:09,550
you know,
a fucking throttling your data because 

1775
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:09,550
they don't like using Netflix.
No,

1776
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:09,550
no,
no,

1777
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:09,550
no,
no.

1778
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:14,950
Now you're dealing with re-engineered 
plants where plants are now the 

1779
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:20,171
distributors of information.
I can't Tevye Tevye Bro,

1780
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:25,840
but it might be real.
I mean they know that plants talk to 

1781
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,601
each other.
There are a hundred percent certain of 

1782
01:18:28,601 --> 01:18:30,200
the prince plants allocate resources.
They have this whole,

1783
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:31,460
uh,
underlying,

1784
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,560
like there's like a,
a whole,

1785
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:38,450
almost like an internet of mycelium and 
like fungus and all this different shit.

1786
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:43,451
All their network of their root system 
and everything that they communicate 

1787
01:18:43,451 --> 01:18:45,350
with each other about what we don't 
know.

1788
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:49,490
We know that they do certain things like
plants here,

1789
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:54,520
uh,
other plants getting eaten and they 

1790
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:54,560
changed their flavor profile and they 
become toxic.

1791
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,870
They have like a terrible toxic taste to
them.

1792
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:57,920
Wet.
Yeah,

1793
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,860
giraffes do that.
Not always.

1794
01:18:59,861 --> 01:19:04,861
It's works or not drops of eucalyptus 
trees do that when drafts are eating 

1795
01:19:04,861 --> 01:19:07,130
them and uh,
a bunch of different trees.

1796
01:19:07,131 --> 01:19:09,320
They've shown that when you,
not only can they,

1797
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:13,430
this is the craziest study they did.
Not only is it not knowing for sure that

1798
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:15,980
these plants are being eaten,
but if they hear it.

1799
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:21,100
So they played recordings of like 
crunching recordings of Caterpillar is 

1800
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,761
eating leaves and they've played it next
to these trees and the trees altered 

1801
01:19:24,761 --> 01:19:29,111
their profile.
They started reading some sort of a 

1802
01:19:29,111 --> 01:19:29,480
chemical that makes their leaves taste 
terrible.

1803
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:33,200
So what they found is like that,
like if it'll happen in Africa,

1804
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:36,350
we're one plant will be thanks to the 
Acacia tree.

1805
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,970
That's what it is.
It is right.

1806
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,100
I'm pretty sure things.
The occasional one that changes,

1807
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:45,110
it's not eucalyptus is the Acacia tree 
and one animal will be eating it.

1808
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,530
The other animals catch wind that 
something's eating it and they literally

1809
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:53,531
become toxic to them.
They taste like shit and so they won't 

1810
01:19:53,531 --> 01:19:57,311
eat it and they'll starve to death 
rather than eat the plants some crazy 

1811
01:19:57,311 --> 01:19:58,910
chemical strategy and they communicate 
with each other.

1812
01:19:58,911 --> 01:20:02,510
That's how they find out that this other
plant is getting eaten.

1813
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,930
It goes through the ground.
They have this fiber of Jesus.

1814
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:07,980
It goes to the ground.
They have this fiber

1815
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,980
of all these different organic things 
like like fungus and mushrooms and shit.

1816
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:16,380
They're communicating with the Lord.
It's amazing.

1817
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:20,580
That is amazing to think that like they 
just don't even hear it.

1818
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:25,790
The allocate resources,
they're like figure out a way to 

1819
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:29,571
allocate resources towards plants that 
are connected to them that are more 

1820
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:30,150
needy.
It's a very bizarre.

1821
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,590
We totally don't know why they do it.
We taught me,

1822
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:35,730
we don't know how they're doing,
it's all some new thing over the last 20

1823
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:40,230
years that people are beginning to 
figure out that these plants are somehow

1824
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:45,231
or another interacting with each other 
and maybe interacting with their 

1825
01:20:45,231 --> 01:20:45,540
environment a way that we just don't 
understand yet.

1826
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:47,130
It's fucking weird,
man.

1827
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:52,910
I mean they might be conscious and just 
some way we just don't imagine we can't 

1828
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:52,910
imagine it.
Right.

1829
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:54,320
But there might be some sort of,
uh,

1830
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,160
you know,
we think of consciousness as like,

1831
01:20:56,161 --> 01:21:01,161
hey man,
I'm going to go to the store to do a 

1832
01:21:01,161 --> 01:21:01,161
set,
you know,

1833
01:21:01,161 --> 01:21:01,161
hey man,
you know,

1834
01:21:01,161 --> 01:21:01,230
I'm going to go take my girl to the 
movies.

1835
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,090
That fucking planet of the apes thing 
looks sweet,

1836
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:08,380
you know,
that's what we think of as 

1837
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:08,380
consciousness.
Every day I do that.

1838
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,960
But without language and whatever the 
fuck plants use for communicating,

1839
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:13,470
it might be some sort of a weird 
language that they have the,

1840
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:18,530
we don't even perceive.
But we could even have classified that 

1841
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:18,530
as language could be.
We don't know.

1842
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,170
I mean,
I don't know.

1843
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:24,171
I'm just guessing.
I'm talking shit while I'm hydro right 

1844
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:28,710
time asking questions because I just 
want to figure out what to have a more 

1845
01:21:30,841 --> 01:21:35,841
plant based diet,
but I don't want motherfuckers 

1846
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:35,841
whispering and shit.
Yeah.

1847
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:37,080
Like donate careless whispers in your 
cauliflower.

1848
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:45,350
Mark somebody,
but maybe they like to eat them because 

1849
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,540
they didn't like it.
Eat them.

1850
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:47,310
How come when you shit out there?
Seeds.

1851
01:21:47,311 --> 01:21:50,070
That's how plants get distributed.
Well,

1852
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:55,071
yeah.
Also how do they know what tastes like 

1853
01:21:55,071 --> 01:21:55,071
shit to us?
If they're altering how it tastes,

1854
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:58,380
they're trying to get us to eat it and 
it was just trying to make it better for

1855
01:21:58,381 --> 01:21:59,910
us to eat them.
Maybe they're like,

1856
01:21:59,911 --> 01:22:01,890
oh,
maybe oh he's eating mark.

1857
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:07,130
Maybe I'll fucking create a new spice 
and maybe it'll be better and he'll eat 

1858
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:07,920
me faster.
Some shit.

1859
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:12,950
Hence peaches.
Why pizza so delicious to try and trick 

1860
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:15,030
you into eating them.
So you shit out one of those pits,

1861
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,110
right?
If you get some nice nutritious shit,

1862
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,380
especially if you've been eating nothing
but peaches,

1863
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:24,780
your shit would probably be fucking 
Primo for growing a peach.

1864
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:27,330
Just ready for an s and m dungeon.

1865
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:32,360
You're out there in the woods,
you take a massive dump with a bunch of 

1866
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,121
peach pits in it and they fertilized and
then a new peach tree grows and this 

1867
01:22:35,191 --> 01:22:37,500
one's even better.
It talks to you in a deep,

1868
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:42,870
slowly,
just like a wolf becoming a French 

1869
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:45,051
bulldog.
The peaches become sweeter and sweeter 

1870
01:22:45,051 --> 01:22:45,051
and sweeter,
and then even we get in the mix like,

1871
01:22:45,051 --> 01:22:49,761
you know what,
this whole peach sweeten and shit just 

1872
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:50,550
seeing happening fast enough for me like
me and my boys Monsanto,

1873
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,640
we brought scalpels and laser beams and 
birth control pills and we're going to 

1874
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,960
figure out how to get these peaches.
Super Sweet.

1875
01:22:57,961 --> 01:23:00,450
And they last for a year,
right?

1876
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:05,540
Yeah.
But what if you'd take a shit and the 

1877
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:07,131
tree grows and it's not pages and shit.
That's shit the shit.

1878
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,150
And you can't hack that square.
That's what ends up happening.

1879
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:13,360
The peaches get so sweet that they turn 
into shit.

1880
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:14,770
Yeah,
right.

1881
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,300
You.
That's the world I want to live in.

1882
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:18,700
It's like you fix it until you break it.
Exactly.

1883
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,950
You fucked up.
You tried to sweet.

1884
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:26,010
Try to get the peaches to sweet and he 
got to the point of grady nature 

1885
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:26,010
rebelled.
Yeah,

1886
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,150
so that's the argument for diseases,
right?

1887
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:33,570
The reason why there's so many diseases 
for human beings is that there's just 

1888
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:33,570
too many of us in nature's like,
no,

1889
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:33,660
no,
no,

1890
01:23:33,661 --> 01:23:34,030
no,
no,

1891
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:34,330
no,
no.

1892
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:39,331
You can't just do this.
You can't just have 7 billion of one 

1893
01:23:39,331 --> 01:23:39,331
thing.
This is fucking stupid.

1894
01:23:39,331 --> 01:23:40,720
We've got to kill some of these things.
No,

1895
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,700
we kind of figured out a way.
No,

1896
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,820
we got like plague and all these 
different things.

1897
01:23:43,821 --> 01:23:44,440
We're like,
no,

1898
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:44,760
no,
no.

1899
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,980
We got injections.
We're gonna.

1900
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:51,010
Kill all that,
and then we're going to keep battling 

1901
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:51,010
it.
One step ahead.

1902
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:53,140
Diseases and scientists are going to war
everyday on the front lines.

1903
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:56,430
I mean,
that's what's going on,

1904
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:57,120
dude.
Nature is trying to.

1905
01:23:57,121 --> 01:24:02,121
Jack,
you think they just trying to pull 

1906
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:02,121
their.
They're pulling the plug on us.

1907
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:03,120
What was the last time you dog

1908
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:04,960
sick?
I don't have a dog.

1909
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,580
If you have a dog,
here's what you do.

1910
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:10,090
You give your dog a Parvo shot.
They get distemper,

1911
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:15,270
they get rabies and they're good.
They go around eating everything they 

1912
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:16,000
find licking,
licking everything,

1913
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:19,210
pissing on everything.
What percentage of dogs get sick?

1914
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:23,980
Is it even one was the dogs that get 
cancer?

1915
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:25,840
Right.
That can happen,

1916
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:30,280
but like dogs getting cold weather.
When does your dog gets sick?

1917
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:31,960
Your dog starts sneezing.
Dog.

1918
01:24:31,961 --> 01:24:32,220
Ever get it?

1919
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,190
Hold the fuck Outta here at dogs.
Don't get my dogs.

1920
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:36,440
I don't have a dog,
but if he did,

1921
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:39,590
I mean I've never heard of a dog getting
it like a sinus infection.

1922
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,770
They happen.
They happen when those bulldogs for sure

1923
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:47,890
they get all fucked up because their 
noses only like a half an inch long 

1924
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:48,500
where they have upper respiratory like 
horrible problems.

1925
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:51,560
I have friends that are bulldogs and 
they said it's a fucking nightmare.

1926
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,540
One of my dogs,
half bulldog.

1927
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:59,050
He's half bull dog and half Shiba Inu.
So he's got like a little bit of a 

1928
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:00,450
longer face.
Watches that star wars character.

1929
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,420
What is the sheep dog?
Okay,

1930
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,540
son of a bitch.
You fucking made that up.

1931
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:08,810
I didn't to country.
Little Furry dog.

1932
01:25:10,910 --> 01:25:14,060
That's a little on the aggressive side.
You know?

1933
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:15,740
Get a little cunty.
Senior dogs,

1934
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:17,180
half content,
half country,

1935
01:25:17,181 --> 01:25:19,490
half months.
Naps just wants a nap,

1936
01:25:19,491 --> 01:25:22,430
but he gets country with other dogs.
He bit my puppy in the face.

1937
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:24,260
It's pretty cool.
So your dog?

1938
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:25,460
No,
that's not my dog,

1939
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:31,030
but my other dog,
the biggest dog a have is the most 

1940
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,070
chill.
He doesn't fuck with anybody.

1941
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,150
What the fuck dog was that?
Oh,

1942
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,880
I did not have eyeballs.
It did have eyeballs.

1943
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:40,790
Do you need glasses?
Let's pull that picture up.

1944
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,210
Oh,
look at that little cutie.

1945
01:25:44,211 --> 01:25:46,640
That's why I got him because he looked 
like that when he was a baby.

1946
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,470
That's what your dog looks like a little
bit.

1947
01:25:48,471 --> 01:25:50,150
Basically a little more bulldog to them.

1948
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:53,670
Tell it her eyes.
But the thing about dogs,

1949
01:25:53,671 --> 01:25:55,320
man,
it's just stayed very so much.

1950
01:25:55,321 --> 01:25:56,850
Personality wise.
It's a trip.

1951
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,880
You could have three dogs from the same 
litter and one of them's just a totally 

1952
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:01,880
different kind of dog.
And the other ones,

1953
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,010
like when they get dogs for police dog 
training,

1954
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:07,520
they never know like what dog's gonna,
like how they're going to come out.

1955
01:26:07,521 --> 01:26:09,590
Like you look for a specific type of 
behavior,

1956
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:12,920
but you don't know why he's like good 
blood lines and everything like that.

1957
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:17,921
But out of illiterate,
they're not 100 percent even in a good 

1958
01:26:17,921 --> 01:26:17,921
bloodline,
but they're normally what kind of

1959
01:26:17,921 --> 01:26:18,680
police dogs are never.
Like,

1960
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:21,800
there are specific,
like German shepherds are.

1961
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:22,220
What are they?

1962
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:24,020
Uh,
they have a bunch of different dogs.

1963
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:26,120
They use Belgian malinois are really 
good,

1964
01:26:26,121 --> 01:26:29,630
but those are super hard to control.
The golden doodle get attack dog.

1965
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:35,110
They're real good attack dogs like the 
second sick on people that like very 

1966
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:37,640
effective because they're super hyper 
aggressive and they'll just go right for

1967
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:41,720
your throat and fuck you up.
They use those a lot in military,

1968
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,220
what they would call the military 
theater.

1969
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,130
Oh Hm.
I like that.

1970
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:48,920
Is that what they say?
They'll say that military theater,

1971
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:53,921
military theater.
And they said that starting closing at 

1972
01:26:53,921 --> 01:26:55,100
seven and then it's like a way to sound 
smarter than you really are.

1973
01:26:55,101 --> 01:26:57,140
If you said using something in the 
military theater,

1974
01:26:57,730 --> 01:27:01,440
like what kind of an asshole says that 
military at theater,

1975
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:05,450
anything you sound like you're smart 
with the diarrhea theater.

1976
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,410
We're going to the.
Yeah.

1977
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:09,050
If they like had musicals and they did 
them in basketball courts,

1978
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,350
they'd make $2.
Nobody go see a musical and a basketball

1979
01:27:12,351 --> 01:27:13,100
court.
You have to go to that.

1980
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:15,980
Now I have to dress up and you can see 
it.

1981
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:18,260
How it really is.
Sneakers squeaking on.

1982
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:23,261
Aluminum steps and these people have no 
microphone and then below you doing 

1983
01:27:23,261 --> 01:27:23,490
their stupid play.
Yeah,

1984
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:24,520
that'd be shit.
Be like,

1985
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:26,390
get the fuck Outta here.
Bitch theater.

1986
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:31,280
Who it went to the um,
this new musical at the gymnasium.

1987
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:36,790
It was terrible.
Everyone started throwing toilet paper 

1988
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:36,790
down on them.

1989
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,800
You go to the theater,
you like this place is old.

1990
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:43,010
This must roll.
I've got a new suit for the gym.

1991
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,050
Yeah.
Nobody's ever said that.

1992
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:50,110
Going to the theater.
Some of the theaters that you're 

1993
01:27:50,110 --> 01:27:52,891
performing,
when you start performing in theaters 

1994
01:27:52,891 --> 01:27:52,891
across the country,
you'll perform in a place.

1995
01:27:52,891 --> 01:27:53,600
It's like star.
It was founded in 19,

1996
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:58,601
20 old.
Weird backstages you going to walk 

1997
01:27:58,601 --> 01:27:58,880
through and everything.
It's fucking pretty dope.

1998
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:04,070
Oh,
what I was going to say earlier as we 

1999
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,361
were talking about Florida and I did my 
last tour and I did 55 cities.

2000
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:09,900
Everything was great and there were only
the only train wreck shows where Florida

2001
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:15,650
and uh,
I did a performance art center and it 

2002
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:16,980
was in,
I believe Orlando I'm going to say.

2003
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:22,370
And I showed up and they had,
I went backstage and they have these 

2004
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:25,820
huge murals for wicked and the lion king
and all these huge productions.

2005
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:29,730
And then there was nick swardson and so 
I was like,

2006
01:28:29,731 --> 01:28:31,590
all right,
did this show me to stop the show?

2007
01:28:31,591 --> 01:28:33,720
Because to chick's got into a fistfight.
Oh,

2008
01:28:33,721 --> 01:28:35,100
of course.
Over what?

2009
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:40,130
I have no idea.
It was in the balcony and I was like 

2010
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:42,140
trying to figure out what was happening,
but I couldn't because they were 

2011
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:42,660
escorted out.
And then afterwards they're like,

2012
01:28:42,661 --> 01:28:43,770
yeah,
it was a fight.

2013
01:28:43,771 --> 01:28:46,380
And then bunch of people,
there's vomit all over the bathrooms.

2014
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:49,260
So that I went out to the staff and was 
like,

2015
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:54,320
what happened?
And all the staff were these old women 

2016
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,411
that were like used to plays and 
musicals and weren't ready for the next 

2017
01:28:58,131 --> 01:29:02,000
sorts and fucking tornado to come in.
So all

2018
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,320
these,
like 80 year old women were not equipped

2019
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:09,350
for like this,
that people are sleeping in the 

2020
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,350
bathroom.
There's puke on the floor.

2021
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:12,870
Like that is hilarious.
It was pretty funny.

2022
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:13,440
I was like,
yeah,

2023
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:16,560
sorry about that.
Next week though,

2024
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:21,561
we've got a next week.
It's a resurgence of cats being brought 

2025
01:29:22,711 --> 01:29:23,790
back by.
Popular demand.

2026
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:28,910
Is cats being played anywhere across the
country because I know it's not on 

2027
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:32,451
Broadway anymore.
I don't know actually asked that same 

2028
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:32,670
question.
It's not on Broadway at all.

2029
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:33,370
That was a,
the,

2030
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,550
I have a bad,
bad,

2031
01:29:35,551 --> 01:29:40,551
uh,
opinion of musicals and a lot of is 

2032
01:29:40,551 --> 01:29:43,071
based on a girl that I dated when I was 
18 who made me go to see cats with her 

2033
01:29:43,071 --> 01:29:43,890
and what not.
And you're 18,

2034
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:46,110
you don't have any fucking patience for 
anything.

2035
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:46,710
Well,
yeah.

2036
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,890
What the fuck?
Definitely don't have any paid two years

2037
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,610
old musical people that are dressing up.

2038
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:52,900
It is playing somewhere.
Ooh.

2039
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,820
Where's it playing on Broadway apparent.
Andrew Lloyd Webber's.

2040
01:29:56,821 --> 01:29:59,670
Long running classic is back on 
Broadway.

2041
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,990
Exclamation point.
I mean from Caroline's.

2042
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:04,670
Remember?
Yeah.

2043
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:09,680
I don't mean to diss it.
Last time I saw it was 30 fucking years 

2044
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:09,680
ago,
32 years ago almost.

2045
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,210
Well,
there's still cats have not evolved.

2046
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,270
I feel like I need to go now.
Let's go.

2047
01:30:14,271 --> 01:30:14,970
Go,
go.

2048
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:20,030
Build lasted like seven stars of death 
deep and we should eat first like hey,

2049
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,890
take the stars of death,
like full on.

2050
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:29,100
Take five stars of death and then have a
stake.

2051
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:34,400
So this is my thought process.
You're sitting in a restaurant like 

2052
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:34,410
right after you order it,
you go,

2053
01:30:34,411 --> 01:30:35,430
all right,
let's do this.

2054
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:40,710
You dumped this stars of death down your
system and then the food starts coming 

2055
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:44,840
so the food piles on your body has to 
struggle to digest the star and all the 

2056
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,370
fat from your food like steak and mashed
potatoes.

2057
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:50,260
If you're feeling non quito and as you 
get it gets cooked.

2058
01:30:50,261 --> 01:30:52,310
And like,
right when these dudes like Doo Doo,

2059
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:54,990
Doo Doo Doo Doo dee dee dee,
you,

2060
01:30:55,030 --> 01:31:00,030
you're just in a cyclone of fear and 
self doubt and self criticism and 

2061
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:07,560
introspective thinking and feeling 
vulnerable about everyone's watching you

2062
01:31:07,561 --> 01:31:09,750
and you know you're going to die and 
everyone's going to die.

2063
01:31:09,751 --> 01:31:11,490
And uh,
and then,

2064
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:17,350
and then to top it off though,
we bring a litter box and so we all 

2065
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:18,990
dedicated to the litter box and then 
when they get mad at us for like,

2066
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:22,290
it's fucking were around cats too.
This is perfect.

2067
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:27,350
I was in Pittsburgh and uh,
I showed up for UFC in Pittsburgh at the

2068
01:31:27,991 --> 01:31:29,910
same time when they had a furry 
convention.

2069
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:33,030
Oh no way.
Just told you go.

2070
01:31:33,031 --> 01:31:34,770
I would've gone into,
couldn't had to work,

2071
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:36,840
cancel the show.
I can't.

2072
01:31:36,841 --> 01:31:38,740
I had a show and then I had to use.
I like,

2073
01:31:38,741 --> 01:31:43,741
it was there for both shows and that had
the UFC way inside the way ends on 

2074
01:31:43,741 --> 01:31:44,640
Friday.
And then I had the show right after.

2075
01:31:44,650 --> 01:31:46,140
I didn't want to go anyway.
I just,

2076
01:31:46,141 --> 01:31:47,360
I just want to,
like they were,

2077
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:50,190
you could see enough by seeing them 
interact in the streets,

2078
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:55,490
but as you're driving down the street,
you would see fucking dozens and dozens 

2079
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:57,300
of people in these furry outfits.
Dozens.

2080
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,890
I mean everywhere you looked,
you saw like these mascots,

2081
01:31:59,891 --> 01:32:00,010
like

2082
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:05,010
squirrels,
fucking people that are dressed up like 

2083
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:05,010
monkeys.
Look at that.

2084
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:05,640
Fox is and shit.
Then they fuck each other.

2085
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:06,580
Yeah,
they do.

2086
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:07,020
Well,
here's,

2087
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:09,940
so you know that anybody wearing that is
fucking something.

2088
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:15,150
Yeah.
And you know what you might like try to 

2089
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:16,300
fuck a female Fox and you pull down the 
pants and it's a hairy dude,

2090
01:32:16,301 --> 01:32:16,930
but you know,
like,

2091
01:32:16,931 --> 01:32:19,250
well God damn it,
I'm already here.

2092
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:24,260
I'm not really ready for this.
But like look how they're all walking 

2093
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:26,971
around and they get together of um,
there's photos of thousands of them 

2094
01:32:26,971 --> 01:32:28,000
together.
Just thousands and people love it.

2095
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:31,720
It's got to be so hot.
But do they physically hot?

2096
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:33,490
Yeah,
like outfit.

2097
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:36,400
I mean I've worn costumes like that just
said like sketches and shit.

2098
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,290
Okay.
But what do you,

2099
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,790
what is going on here in this picture?
This is so strange.

2100
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:41,200
They're courting each other.

2101
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:43,150
They're holding hands and staring into 
juices,

2102
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:45,010
eyes like,
you know what this is?

2103
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:50,130
It's like you saw cartoons and your 
little kid and they just fucked your 

2104
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:50,170
brain and be like,
well this is what I'm looking forward to

2105
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:52,420
when I get out of this house.
Then you got out of the house,

2106
01:32:52,421 --> 01:32:54,790
you hear car accidents,
gunshots,

2107
01:32:55,240 --> 01:33:00,240
rape,
but do they fuck each other while 

2108
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,251
they're both wearing a costume or do 
they fuck people that aren't wearing a 

2109
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:02,251
costume?
Apparently,

2110
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:06,870
and this is it.
I'm sorry if you are a member of the 

2111
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:09,220
furry community and I misrepresent you,
but some of them have hatches were their

2112
01:33:09,221 --> 01:33:12,570
asshole is sort of like those old school
pajamas in those.

2113
01:33:12,571 --> 01:33:17,571
A wild west cartoons.
Remember the wild west pajamas where 

2114
01:33:17,571 --> 01:33:21,421
they had like a.
like Popeye always had those dukie flap 

2115
01:33:21,421 --> 01:33:21,421
and you've got two buttons that cover 
your shit,

2116
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:26,790
like the shit trap and you open up the 
trap door and drop a bomb in there and 

2117
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:27,370
then button that fucker back up.

2118
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,470
They didn't have.
They probably had draw strings.

2119
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:31,720
They probably didn't even have like 
rubber waistbands back then.

2120
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:33,760
Right?
Like how it goes.

2121
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:37,870
Big Buttons on either side.
How do they tighten down your underwear?

2122
01:33:37,871 --> 01:33:39,940
Back then it was buttons that makes 
sense.

2123
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:45,540
It's probably a buttons in the front.
Buttons in the Shitter who did buttons 

2124
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:46,150
on everything back then,
so these kids,

2125
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:51,360
they thought that was the future and 
then they went out there and they got 

2126
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,481
punched in the face.
The moment they left their house and 

2127
01:33:54,481 --> 01:33:56,971
then probably somebody did terrible 
things to them and they went to school 

2128
01:33:56,971 --> 01:33:59,791
and they got picked on and then he had 
are just wishing they were a squirrel 

2129
01:33:59,791 --> 01:33:59,791
holistically.
It was horrible.

2130
01:33:59,791 --> 01:34:04,261
Just look in the cartoon.
That was my favorite thought when I was 

2131
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:04,261
young and what's this girl cartoon and 
be like,

2132
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:04,820
Oh,
you want to be a squirrel?

2133
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:07,450
I didn't want to go to school.
Didn't want to do this anymore.

2134
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:10,660
Just want to be a squirrel.
Will the hotel where we were at,

2135
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,720
they got a request with.
They're filled up with furries except me

2136
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:15,760
and a few of the other UFC staff.
I'm not.

2137
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:20,850
I'm not lying.
It's filled and they got a request and 

2138
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:24,100
the request was the furies asked if they
could put a litter box in the lobby.

2139
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,840
No Way.
Yes.

2140
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:28,330
They wanted to pay for a litter box,
be brought into the lobby.

2141
01:34:28,331 --> 01:34:30,610
They liked this whole convention is all 
us,

2142
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,630
so can we do that?
And like.

2143
01:34:31,631 --> 01:34:33,370
I was like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

2144
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:38,550
They took my idea for cats.
They tried to get a litter box and put 

2145
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:41,020
it in the front lobby of like the 
western in Pittsburgh to make smell.

2146
01:34:41,021 --> 01:34:46,021
Ian Apparently.
I mean it could have all just been just 

2147
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,630
good to be like,
come on man.

2148
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:54,780
Well they definitely were asking for 
food to be delivered in bowls on the 

2149
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:54,970
ground.
Whatever they ordered.

2150
01:34:54,971 --> 01:34:57,740
They wanted to put a bowl like a dog 
food bowl and it on the ground.

2151
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:58,370
Right.

2152
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:02,330
It was several different rooms that were
requesting this that I can see though if

2153
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:07,331
you're going to go that distance,
but if you're not taking a shit in the 

2154
01:35:07,331 --> 01:35:07,790
fucking lobby,
right?

2155
01:35:08,230 --> 01:35:09,980
August,
you don't know until you ask.

2156
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:12,260
I think it's all us.
It's all us here.

2157
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:14,450
It's just all us.
We're amongst friends.

2158
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,730
We'll pay.
We'll pay him.

2159
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,710
Let me just ask.
Let's just ask like,

2160
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:20,510
they're so crazy.
They just probably asked.

2161
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:21,800
Yeah,
I mean I like have.

2162
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:23,450
They'll just have a litter box in your 
room.

2163
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:25,700
In the lobby.
Yeah.

2164
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,660
Come on,
man.

2165
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:31,750
I've been a lot of them.
Had them in their room going up that 

2166
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:35,771
fucking flight of stairs with a Duffel 
bag filled with litter housekeeping and 

2167
01:35:39,171 --> 01:35:44,171
a big Ole fucking plastic cement mixer 
for the kitty litter and one of those 

2168
01:35:46,281 --> 01:35:47,660
plastic cement mixes.
You know,

2169
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:49,010
ever make concrete.
When you were a kid.

2170
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,730
Do you ever have to make concrete?
No.

2171
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,840
Construction jobs.
Sometimes you'd have to make concrete so

2172
01:35:53,841 --> 01:35:55,910
you have to pour the shit and pour the 
water and mix it.

2173
01:35:56,260 --> 01:36:01,260
You have to mix it.
And this big old fucking plastic tub 

2174
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:04,061
that was a lot like a big litter box and
you could just do that just to get one 

2175
01:36:04,061 --> 01:36:04,940
of them.
Cement mix and tubs could.

2176
01:36:04,941 --> 01:36:08,720
Lord,
I want to do that.

2177
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,210
I want to try it.
If you get thousands of people,

2178
01:36:11,211 --> 01:36:13,850
I would get into a furry outfit.
I don't want to get fucked,

2179
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:17,240
but would you be.
Who would I be?

2180
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:18,280
Yeah,
it could be a furry.

2181
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,990
Like what creature would you?
Uh,

2182
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:21,500
what do you feel like your spirit animal
is?

2183
01:36:21,501 --> 01:36:23,990
Nick?
It's a good question.

2184
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,340
I don't know.
Maybe.

2185
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:33,680
Do you think you're a monkey or wolf?
I would say a monkey over a wolf if 

2186
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,820
those are the options.
Okay.

2187
01:36:34,821 --> 01:36:39,821
So we're moving more towards monkey.
I'm just trying to get like a taste 

2188
01:36:39,821 --> 01:36:39,821
palate.
It's a series of questions that I use to

2189
01:36:39,821 --> 01:36:40,880
determine which one will be best for 
you.

2190
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:43,430
Oh,
I would say a squirrel.

2191
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:44,870
Squirrel.
Yeah.

2192
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:47,510
Like you already midwest.
You are rat,

2193
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:49,370
but your tail is so cute.
We let it slide.

2194
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:51,860
Plus you only eat nuts and plants.
Yeah.

2195
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:55,300
Rats eat everything.
Yeah.

2196
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,290
Sketchy.
Yeah.

2197
01:36:57,291 --> 01:36:59,990
Rats or just can't be trusted carrying 
diseases.

2198
01:36:59,991 --> 01:37:04,991
Squirrels are chill.
I used to hang out with girls in New 

2199
01:37:04,991 --> 01:37:07,510
York.
I would go into a union square and I 

2200
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:10,970
wouldn't get up.
I saw a guy get a bag of nuts and I 

2201
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:13,721
watched him.
He would sit in the middle of the park 

2202
01:37:13,721 --> 01:37:13,721
and the squirrels would come and crawl 
on him and he would put the,

2203
01:37:13,721 --> 01:37:16,980
he would put a nut in his fist and the 
squirrels would reach in like,

2204
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:20,030
like it was like a little hole and pull 
those out and eat it on his arm.

2205
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,550
So I studied this guy for weeks and I 
was like,

2206
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:27,551
I don't want to fucking do that.
So I go and I get a bag of nuts and I 

2207
01:37:27,551 --> 01:37:30,581
got the courage up and I got into the 
middle of the park and I sat there and 

2208
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:33,851
the squirrels started coming on me and I
started getting panicky but you can't 

2209
01:37:33,851 --> 01:37:37,721
panic.
So I zoned out and then the squirrels 

2210
01:37:37,721 --> 01:37:39,110
started feeding out of my hands and I 
started becoming squirrel man.

2211
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:41,480
And then I started.
I wanted to show my friends.

2212
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:45,800
So I bring my buddies and the like,
like to the park with me and I'm like,

2213
01:37:45,801 --> 01:37:47,330
watch this.
And they'd be like,

2214
01:37:47,331 --> 01:37:49,610
what the fuck are you doing now?
And I'm like,

2215
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:51,450
watching this girls will be on my arms 
and stuff.

2216
01:37:51,451 --> 01:37:52,910
And my friends were like,
dude,

2217
01:37:52,911 --> 01:37:56,040
I'm not on board with this.
Nobody thought it was cool.

2218
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,100
It just thought I was like a fucking 
complete lunatic.

2219
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,930
And I saw it.
I was like this.

2220
01:38:00,931 --> 01:38:02,840
I thought it was like an x men or 
something like that.

2221
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:07,380
I had gotten this like power that I 
dialed into like a whole.

2222
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:09,720
I don't know.
He became like a beastmaster.

2223
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:10,890
Yeah,
I thought it was rad.

2224
01:38:10,891 --> 01:38:12,140
But you remember that show?
Yeah,

2225
01:38:12,141 --> 01:38:17,141
of course.
The duties to be able to tell animals 

2226
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:19,140
what to do and they all listen to him.
That was the shit fucking ripped.

2227
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,750
The one thing she could remake.
They fucking doubt.

2228
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,650
That'd be a sweet remake.
I know 100 percent.

2229
01:38:25,651 --> 01:38:28,170
You should be the beastmaster.
You or me?

2230
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,880
We could be beastmaster.
We could do it.

2231
01:38:29,881 --> 01:38:33,120
Brothers and sisters.
Beastmaster need a bunch of chicks to.

2232
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:35,730
We gotta you gotTa have diversity today.
If you're going to pitch a show,

2233
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:40,920
we should have at least one black female
trans beastmaster look at them.

2234
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:44,310
That seems like the newer version of the
master.

2235
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,400
Is that the original beastmaster?
I didn't know.

2236
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:50,610
There's that guy right above that.
Yeah.

2237
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:55,640
That was the original beastmaster dad 
was the dude that was in a movie called 

2238
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:59,130
laserblast.
Laserblast was a fucking favorite 

2239
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:01,530
science fiction movie of mine when I was
a kid.

2240
01:39:01,531 --> 01:39:04,050
Man.
Like during the star wars days.

2241
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,510
Yeah.
And he found his gun.

2242
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:09,810
He found his gun on the right.
Oh,

2243
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:14,811
so bad.
You put it was this alien gun that you 

2244
01:39:14,811 --> 01:39:18,441
put in your arm,
like you put your arm in it rather like 

2245
01:39:18,441 --> 01:39:18,810
you fist this gun,
I guess how it works.

2246
01:39:18,811 --> 01:39:23,811
And he found this thing like the alien 
that's crashed their spaceship and lost 

2247
01:39:23,811 --> 01:39:28,371
their gun and this dude picked it up and
the gun slowly but surely turned him 

2248
01:39:28,371 --> 01:39:31,260
into this monster.
It was awesome fucking thing.

2249
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:33,390
Yeah.
See that guy like see the pictures?

2250
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:35,850
Those are the actual aliens.
That's what he turned into.

2251
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:40,150
Those.
The laserblast 1978 dude.

2252
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,780
Yeah.
It was 11 years old and this came out.

2253
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,220
So when you see the guy like in the 
upper pictures,

2254
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,680
go scroll up,
scroll up a little bit,

2255
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:49,080
see that like the one with the teeth out
and the left hand side.

2256
01:39:49,081 --> 01:39:51,090
And the top on the left hand side.
Yeah,

2257
01:39:51,091 --> 01:39:52,110
that one.
That,

2258
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:55,650
that is what he turned into when he kept
fucking with that gun.

2259
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,220
The more it was like sort of like a take
on columns ring in a way,

2260
01:39:59,221 --> 01:40:01,500
right?
Like the more he fucked with his gun,

2261
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:06,620
like the more he would become like one 
of those aliens and start shooting shit 

2262
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:09,840
with this weird fisting gun.
It was dope though,

2263
01:40:09,841 --> 01:40:11,190
Dude.
See if you can get a clip.

2264
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:13,860
You find a clip online.
Turns into me in Vegas.

2265
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,500
Hey Dude.
When you're 11,

2266
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,900
it's awesome.
Cool screen.

2267
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:21,600
It's a special preview.
Oh this is a preview.

2268
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:22,840
See?
So dude,

2269
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:24,000
find system.
The desert.

2270
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:26,160
What the fuck can the aliens like?
Oh No.

2271
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,280
He's got a gun.
They're pissed off.

2272
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:34,310
See?
They're in their spaceship and he uses 

2273
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:34,350
it right now.
Somewhere on this.

2274
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:40,410
Yeah.
See the spaceship lands and visitors to 

2275
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:48,010
the effect.
Oh my God is the greatest thing of all 

2276
01:40:50,191 --> 01:40:53,670
time.
Shot them.

2277
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,780
Fuck them up.
And they fucked him up.

2278
01:40:55,970 --> 01:41:00,970
Anything on this in the future?
Look it up.

2279
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:11,270
He just looks like a Douche,
right?

2280
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,240
Turned into a monster.
Look.

2281
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:28,320
Tried to take it away,
ladies.

2282
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:40,650
We have the new studio.
We should do a fight companion with this

2283
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:44,200
movie laser blast wound.
You don't drink anymore?

2284
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,820
I do.
You do?

2285
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,620
I'm just taking a break.
How much of a break?

2286
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:53,040
I'm sorry.
I started on the movie and like two 

2287
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,571
weeks,
so I'm taking a break until after Labor 

2288
01:41:54,571 --> 01:41:56,700
Day.
After Labor Day you and I will get 

2289
01:41:56,700 --> 01:42:00,070
fucked up and we'll watch laserblast 100
percent and we will start it from play.

2290
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:03,040
Will Watch this fucking silly movie.
Play more of it.

2291
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:08,230
Keep it.
Just keep it running in the background 

2292
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:08,230
the entire time.
This show's on.

2293
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:12,300
Yeah,
it was like 10 seconds left of the 

2294
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:12,300
trailer.
So bad.

2295
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:13,330
How bad is it?
That looks really bad.

2296
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:17,020
I'm a gun.
Sounds like that.

2297
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:18,470
Oh,
I was

2298
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:19,520
wrong.
That's not.

2299
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:22,240
That's not the laserblast guy.
It's a different grants and different.

2300
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:26,480
It looks like he's from another movie 
though.

2301
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:31,540
The Guy,
the laser blast guy was in or the 

2302
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:31,540
beastmaster guy was in some other 
movies.

2303
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:33,560
He looks familiar.
He looks like an old of shit.

2304
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:36,740
What is this a French for?
Not The whole movie.

2305
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,710
They said,
well wait,

2306
01:42:39,711 --> 01:42:42,530
show beastmaster trailer,
how bad it is.

2307
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:47,690
Look how bad.
Like even though like the fucking 

2308
01:42:47,690 --> 01:42:50,201
letters or shaky like when they play the
letters because when they can't even 

2309
01:42:50,201 --> 01:42:54,071
keep it,
no effort into the skill back then they 

2310
01:42:54,071 --> 01:42:57,641
would like,
they would do all the shit by hand like 

2311
01:42:57,641 --> 01:42:57,641
a bunch of monkeys.
That's a dude.

2312
01:42:57,641 --> 01:43:01,181
Kim Milford.
Cheryl Smith was probably hot as fuck 

2313
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:01,181
back in the day,
right?

2314
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:01,520
She definitely did.
Coke,

2315
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:04,760
do you think so?
I mean it was 1978.

2316
01:43:04,761 --> 01:43:05,330
I don't think they were.

2317
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:10,340
Do.
I don't think you had a choice back 

2318
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:10,340
then?
Yeah,

2319
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:10,340
they made you do coke.
They punched in your face after you when

2320
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:11,930
you were born and you had to wear bell 
bottoms.

2321
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:14,570
This is the beginning of the movie.
Dude's like,

2322
01:43:14,571 --> 01:43:15,500
Hey,
what's that?

2323
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,360
Like this movie?
So fucking stupid.

2324
01:43:17,361 --> 01:43:18,200
He's like,
well,

2325
01:43:18,201 --> 01:43:23,160
just walking through boiling hot shit 
desert.

2326
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:26,900
So I think this is like the alien with a
gun.

2327
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:28,490
Well,
let's save it until we wait.

2328
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:29,180
Okay.
Yeah.

2329
01:43:29,181 --> 01:43:30,950
That's what we watched and we'll save 
it.

2330
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:31,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

2331
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:34,460
This is the original alien that he was 
a.

2332
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,000
that's what it was,
that that guy dies and leaves him the 

2333
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,170
gun boiler alert,
so I'm wrong.

2334
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,600
I thought that that guy was the 
beastmaster guy,

2335
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:50,320
but beastmaster doesn't matter.
We were still turned onto a gem with 

2336
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:50,630
laser blast.
I'm glad I remembered that.

2337
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,040
I don't how I remembered that.

2338
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:57,910
I don't know how the fuck that's still 
in my brain because I haven't seen that 

2339
01:43:57,910 --> 01:44:01,091
movie and I probably haven't seen it 
since like a year after I watched the 

2340
01:44:01,091 --> 01:44:02,860
first sign,
that singer he was in,

2341
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,970
he was in some movie,
played a blind guy.

2342
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:07,580
That guy's been in everything.
Yeah.

2343
01:44:07,870 --> 01:44:10,370
He was a teen wolf.
Kissing a dude.

2344
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:11,960
What's that all about?
Cut that out.

2345
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:16,490
A beauty and the beast.
He's going Lrg on that.

2346
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:17,590
Yeah,
he's in.

2347
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,700
That guy's got a gang of movies.
He did,

2348
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:24,560
but also peace master and the young and 
the restless.

2349
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,620
If you had a beastmaster,
would it.

2350
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:30,830
Would people think it was racist?
If you hired a black guy,

2351
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:37,360
what do you mean?
If you had a guy that could talk to 

2352
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,600
monkeys,
because obviously he's a white guy.

2353
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:43,930
If it's a white guy in the white guy can
walk into the forest falcons land on 

2354
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:45,620
them and fucking drafts come up to him 
and he gives him an apple and shit.

2355
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:50,620
Everybody's cool with it.
But if you had a black guy like jet 

2356
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:54,581
black,
Wesley Snipes Black and he's walking 

2357
01:44:54,581 --> 01:44:55,950
through the jungle and all the animals 
flocked to him and he,

2358
01:44:55,951 --> 01:44:57,890
he had the monkeys,
they talk to each other.

2359
01:44:57,891 --> 01:45:02,770
He tells the monkeys what to do.
People will be like no fucking way.

2360
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:08,680
That is so racist.
Are you saying that black people are 

2361
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,880
like closer to these animals to fuck?
No,

2362
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:11,240
no,
no.

2363
01:45:11,241 --> 01:45:12,470
That's what we're saying.
No,

2364
01:45:12,471 --> 01:45:12,860
no,
no.

2365
01:45:12,861 --> 01:45:14,770
We're saying he's really cool and the 
animals like,

2366
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:20,050
that's not what I got out of it bro.
How come white people can't talk to 

2367
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:23,351
monkeys but black people can't get the 
fuck out of here with your racist 

2368
01:45:23,351 --> 01:45:25,790
bullshit ass ablest movie.
Right?

2369
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,920
But,
but if it's a white blonde guy,

2370
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:28,430
you're like,
yeah,

2371
01:45:28,431 --> 01:45:31,220
as soon as I can talk to anything,
it's amazing.

2372
01:45:31,221 --> 01:45:33,410
He's like channels.
The spirits with these animals.

2373
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:38,410
They know he's pure.
Isn't official here supposed to a 

2374
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:38,410
Unicorn?
People would freak out.

2375
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:40,430
He doesn't have any clothes on it,
but it's Harris quaffed.

2376
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,740
He's like,
he doesn't need clothes,

2377
01:45:42,741 --> 01:45:44,870
bro.
I just need shampoo and conditioner.

2378
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,880
He lives in the jungle,
but his hair is just perfect.

2379
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:52,940
Fits just like styles,
a little kind of frosted lightly.

2380
01:45:52,941 --> 01:45:54,910
Somehow he is highlighted for the 
forest.

2381
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:59,210
Doesn't make any sense.
He's super close with the eagles.

2382
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:04,720
Dude.
I had a hawk issue in my backyard 

2383
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:04,720
yesterday.
Um,

2384
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:08,950
I tweeted.
I instagram is picture that I found a 

2385
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:12,830
hawk dead in my yard that another animal
had something had bitten.

2386
01:46:12,831 --> 01:46:14,930
It's head off.
She's eaten.

2387
01:46:14,931 --> 01:46:17,600
It's a breast tissue.
Okay.

2388
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:20,030
So that was a while back.
Well,

2389
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:22,880
yesterday I was out in my yard and I let
the chickens out.

2390
01:46:22,881 --> 01:46:27,881
I've chickens and the chickens are 
wandering around and there's three 

2391
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:27,881
fucking hawks.

2392
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:28,790
They're not big hawks.
They're small.

2393
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:30,610
They're like the size of this thermos,
you know,

2394
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:32,450
so probably like 12 inches high or 
something.

2395
01:46:32,451 --> 01:46:37,451
Not a big hawk,
but they're trying to jack these 

2396
01:46:37,451 --> 01:46:41,111
chickens.
They're there like on the chicken coop 

2397
01:46:41,111 --> 01:46:44,410
and one of them swoops down and slams 
into the Mesh like bangs into the mesh 

2398
01:46:44,421 --> 01:46:46,880
of the chicken coop.
Like just trying to get at them.

2399
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:50,490
She's a dude.
So I'm like,

2400
01:46:50,491 --> 01:46:55,491
this is crazy.
So I have my kids come out and my wife 

2401
01:46:55,491 --> 01:46:58,401
come out and we're looking at these 
birds swooping down and one of them 

2402
01:46:58,401 --> 01:46:59,340
landing on top of the roof and the other
one's in the trees.

2403
01:47:00,110 --> 01:47:01,980
I'm like,
this is so fucking strange,

2404
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:02,760
man.
What is going on?

2405
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:06,720
And they're just making noise like 
really loud.

2406
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:11,370
They're juveniles and I've,
I've found two of them that are dead and

2407
01:47:11,371 --> 01:47:16,371
what I'm thinking,
the two of them that I found that are 

2408
01:47:16,371 --> 01:47:16,371
dead are bigger.

2409
01:47:16,371 --> 01:47:16,371
So I did,
I saw these animals,

2410
01:47:16,371 --> 01:47:18,480
these small ones.
And then the next day I found a dead one

2411
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,200
in the dead.
One a also had its head missing.

2412
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:27,650
I think there's some sort of a,
a bird war going on in my neighborhood 

2413
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:30,870
that there's like a bird gang war going 
on and I think there's hawks and there's

2414
01:47:30,871 --> 01:47:33,200
larger hawks.
And um,

2415
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:38,300
one of my friends saw a larger hawk 
eating baby hawks in a tree.

2416
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,180
Good Lord.
Yeah,

2417
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:41,910
yeah,
he was,

2418
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:46,530
he was in the,
on the way down the street and uh,

2419
01:47:46,531 --> 01:47:51,030
apparently go into his car and he saw 
these hawks that are in our neighborhood

2420
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:54,750
killing these baby hawks and we're like,
what the fuck is going on?

2421
01:47:55,230 --> 01:47:56,040
And so I was like,
well,

2422
01:47:56,230 --> 01:47:58,620
so there were,
the babies were there by themselves.

2423
01:47:58,621 --> 01:48:01,050
They were like in the.
And then the hawks killing the babies.

2424
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:02,400
Like he saw it happen.

2425
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:03,900
I was like,
that is insane.

2426
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:08,901
So this is like some sort of a gang war 
because they told them about the hawks 

2427
01:48:08,901 --> 01:48:08,901
being dead and he found one of them 
like,

2428
01:48:08,901 --> 01:48:10,770
that shit is getting real in your 
neighborhood.

2429
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:14,350
Did it's crazy fucking hock Mageddon I 
wonder.

2430
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:16,680
I think it's just hawks killing other 
hawks.

2431
01:48:16,681 --> 01:48:21,681
Like they're trying to like establish 
probably just like all these other 

2432
01:48:21,681 --> 01:48:23,310
animal.
Apparently mountain lions do that.

2433
01:48:23,311 --> 01:48:28,311
Two bears do that.
They'll kill young ones to find other 

2434
01:48:28,311 --> 01:48:28,860
people's young and kill them because 
they think they're competition.

2435
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,960
There's only so many rats,
you know,

2436
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:34,530
or a rabbit that the hawk and eat cad.
Fuck Dude,

2437
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,810
that's been 10th.
So we found two,

2438
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:39,620
two different hawks with no heads.
Do you normally have a lot of hawks?

2439
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:42,180
Neighborhood is definitely.
You see them all the time.

2440
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:45,320
You see him floating around.
There's circling all the time.

2441
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:50,370
See them all the time.
You go all throughout the Hollywood 

2442
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:50,370
hills.
You can see him.

2443
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:51,660
I don't know if I've ever seen a hug.
Maybe my friend Tom,

2444
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:56,690
Tom Sharona director,
he was in his house and studio city and 

2445
01:48:56,690 --> 01:48:56,690
he watched a,
a,

2446
01:48:56,690 --> 01:49:00,480
like a dove or some small bird just get 
jacked by a hawk right in front of them.

2447
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:02,050
It was sitting on a,
on a,

2448
01:49:02,051 --> 01:49:03,330
um,
a fence.

2449
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:04,980
Just the burbs just sitting there 
chilling.

2450
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:06,540
Oh,
what a wonderful day to be a bird.

2451
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:11,780
And he said this Hawk just came to swap.
Just grabbed them right there and 

2452
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:12,450
fucking flew off.
And they do it just for fun,

2453
01:49:12,451 --> 01:49:12,990
right?
They don't know.

2454
01:49:12,991 --> 01:49:14,130
They eat them.
They eat birds.

2455
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:16,440
Do they really do birds?
The birds?

2456
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:19,340
Yeah.
We played a video of owls,

2457
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:21,530
Jack and hawk.
Oh yeah,

2458
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:23,970
never seen that jacking a hog.
Hey.

2459
01:49:23,971 --> 01:49:24,810
Yeah,
it's crazy.

2460
01:49:24,811 --> 01:49:26,940
I've seen owls eat rabbits and shit.
Right?

2461
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:31,440
They put a night vision camera on this 
tree so they could capture these,

2462
01:49:31,441 --> 01:49:33,040
uh,
these hawks that we're in this,

2463
01:49:33,041 --> 01:49:34,230
uh,
this little nest together.

2464
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:39,360
It might be even a young hawk and is our
will comes in from out of the sky like 

2465
01:49:39,961 --> 01:49:41,910
you don't see anything until you see his
eyes.

2466
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:45,510
He seeds floating eyes.
And then who watch this?

2467
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:47,860
Watch this video.
It's amazing.

2468
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:49,640
That's a hawk.
Yeah.

2469
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:52,130
Watch this.
Boom.

2470
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:55,720
Later.
Just Jackson his buddies like more time.

2471
01:49:55,721 --> 01:49:56,650
One more time.
One more time.

2472
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:57,700
Yeah,
let's see that again.

2473
01:49:57,870 --> 01:50:00,520
See the little eyes in the distance.
See how they're floating.

2474
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:02,020
Oh,
Holy Shit.

2475
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,200
This bitch.
Oh my gosh.

2476
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:07,180
Crazy.
Is that so?

2477
01:50:07,181 --> 01:50:08,380
There you go.
There's your answer.

2478
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:10,090
Birdsy Burger.
Dude.

2479
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,070
That's intense.
Seat the fuck out of each.

2480
01:50:12,071 --> 01:50:14,230
I mean if you see Ethan Hawke and your 
neighborhood,

2481
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:19,060
you get fucking lily worried.
Looking very predatory lately.

2482
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:22,070
That would be really scary.
That would be dope.

2483
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:24,610
I wish my last name or Hark.
You can make it hawk,

2484
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:29,270
but he did think he does names like 
Ethan Wiener Schnitzel,

2485
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:35,860
like got to be mysterious.
I've got to be Hawk eighth and Shama 

2486
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:36,750
Llama.
Dang.

2487
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,830
Dang.
There's a lot of people have done that.

2488
01:50:38,831 --> 01:50:40,150
Right?
Like Jamie Foxx,

2489
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:45,370
he had the most brilliant idea ever.
He made his name and Androgynous name so

2490
01:50:45,371 --> 01:50:50,371
that he would get picked as people to go
up in the laugh factory because it was 

2491
01:50:50,371 --> 01:50:54,500
an open mic and they would pick chicks 
more than they would pick dudes because 

2492
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:59,031
there weren't very many chicks,
so they're trying to get a certain 

2493
01:50:59,031 --> 01:50:59,031
amount of checks.

2494
01:50:59,031 --> 01:51:02,490
So he made his name ambiguous.
He changed his name to Jamie Foxx with 

2495
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:03,820
two x's.
That's pretty cool.

2496
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:05,710
Smart.
His old standups.

2497
01:51:05,711 --> 01:51:07,670
Hilarious.
I used to watch this little showtime.

2498
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:11,010
Suppose he's going to be on on Thursday.
Is He really?

2499
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,310
Oh,
that's amazing.

2500
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,510
Like I can do everything.
Yeah.

2501
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,740
He's just bizarre.
God suddenly talented.

2502
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:20,940
He can sing.
He can act like in like little 

2503
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:22,840
legitimate would sing and legitimately 
enact act and do stand up and stand up.

2504
01:51:22,841 --> 01:51:24,160
Stand up some fucking hardest.
I mean,

2505
01:51:24,161 --> 01:51:27,730
that's to be like a monster.
He was a big headliner dude.

2506
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:29,890
Did you remember when it was a monster?
It just stopped doing it.

2507
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:35,070
The foxhole member,
when he had that character they did on 

2508
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:37,120
in living color.
The woman with the giant crazy lips.

2509
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,770
Fucking hilarious.
Who would walk on?

2510
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:42,370
He was the original duck face,
right?

2511
01:51:42,610 --> 01:51:45,090
Wasn't she?
Was.

2512
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:48,160
Did she do that wasn't my imagining that
she made a duck face?

2513
01:51:48,430 --> 01:51:49,210
No,
she did.

2514
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:51,530
Is that the original founder?
Right.

2515
01:51:53,650 --> 01:51:56,590
Can I see Wanda?
Do you think that ugly?

2516
01:51:56,591 --> 01:51:58,630
Wanda is the original of the duck?
Yeah.

2517
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:01,550
There's the duck face.
Ugly wonder that character.

2518
01:52:01,551 --> 01:52:05,220
It might be the original duck fat.
That might be what?

2519
01:52:05,221 --> 01:52:06,340
Like what?
Everybody copies.

2520
01:52:06,341 --> 01:52:07,600
That's already hilarious,
right?

2521
01:52:07,601 --> 01:52:12,601
They're hilarious dude in living color 
is a forgotten show as one of the 

2522
01:52:12,601 --> 01:52:13,350
funniest fucking shows.
Our.

2523
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:14,950
Yeah.
It was amazing to do.

2524
01:52:14,951 --> 01:52:16,330
Remember Handyman.
Yeah,

2525
01:52:16,331 --> 01:52:18,610
of course.
Do Remember File Marshal Bill.

2526
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:23,200
I remember Marshall.
Bill Kinda can't stop coughing.

2527
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:25,270
Um,
Fire Marshal Bill.

2528
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:26,770
I was,
I was playing pool.

2529
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:30,790
Me and my friend John were playing pool 
in New York in this show was on a,

2530
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:32,530
you know,
above the pool table and we were like,

2531
01:52:32,531 --> 01:52:36,970
what the fuck?
Like I can't even believe this is a real

2532
01:52:36,971 --> 01:52:39,700
show.
Like there would never been a show.

2533
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:42,940
Like when Jim Carrey played that guy 
who'd been burnt up in a fire,

2534
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:48,400
never been a fucking sketch show where 
they show to guy the burns all over his 

2535
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:48,400
face.

2536
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:48,530
Like,
what the fuck?

2537
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:53,950
Oh yeah.
And also remember that he had no lips a 

2538
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:55,010
little bit crazy.
That is insane.

2539
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:58,310
Clip.
We'll also Venus de Milo.

2540
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:00,350
The person was.
Did Crystal Meth,

2541
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:03,020
crystal Meth,
trans weightlifter.

2542
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:08,720
Like what the,
how do you even pitch that?

2543
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:13,310
What a crazy show people forgot.
How about two snaps up?

2544
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,890
Remember that?
It was amazing.

2545
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:18,050
People forgot.
They forgot how good the show was.

2546
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:23,470
Yeah,
they were great when we were young in 

2547
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:23,720
the nineties.
This was the show.

2548
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:28,990
Yeah,
it was hilarious because this show is 

2549
01:53:28,990 --> 01:53:28,990
the show that launched Jennifer,
Jennifer Lopez.

2550
01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:31,220
It didn't launch her.
She was a flag girl bro.

2551
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:31,550
Well,
yeah,

2552
01:53:31,551 --> 01:53:35,960
but I mean,
but she wasn't acting on the show.

2553
01:53:36,330 --> 01:53:37,040
Didn't matter,
dude.

2554
01:53:37,490 --> 01:53:41,370
She became a fly girl.
Come on son and have some respect,

2555
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,740
right?
No,

2556
01:53:42,741 --> 01:53:45,930
I'm just saying pressed,
pressed.

2557
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:46,760
It's.
She's flagger.

2558
01:53:46,761 --> 01:53:48,380
I just.
I remember her being a flagger.

2559
01:53:48,381 --> 01:53:51,080
I'm saying she didn't.
That was her first thing.

2560
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:52,280
Was there a freezer?
First thing,

2561
01:53:52,281 --> 01:53:54,830
man,
where she got her in the front.

2562
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:56,720
That's turned the bottom.
Holy Fuck.

2563
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,370
I want my money back.
What have you done?

2564
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:00,140
What do you really look like?

2565
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:07,390
How did you do that?
That is funny that they had.

2566
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:12,080
She was the first girl I girls.
She was the first girl.

2567
01:54:12,081 --> 01:54:14,420
Become famous for her ass.
Right?

2568
01:54:14,810 --> 01:54:16,810
Not for her.
Obviously she's talented.

2569
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,190
Don't get me wrong.
Now.

2570
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,090
OCI,
great shape,

2571
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:25,810
but she also resisted the temptation to 
accentuate that ass and artificial 

2572
01:54:25,810 --> 01:54:28,130
manner.
She's stuck with squats and dancing,

2573
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:30,830
respect,
respect.

2574
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,750
Because she was the original big booty 
girl,

2575
01:54:32,810 --> 01:54:37,810
right?
I mean if you think about it and then 

2576
01:54:37,810 --> 01:54:37,810
all those other chicks.
Yeah,

2577
01:54:37,810 --> 01:54:38,690
that's the first person I remember when 
people are like,

2578
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:40,940
Oh shit,
some people are taking it too far.

2579
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:45,320
I saw a young lady this weekend that was
just taking it way too far.

2580
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:51,100
Well,
I mean why it's a implants to me are so 

2581
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:51,100
bizarre.
I don't know why the fuck.

2582
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:52,580
I don't know what that does.
That's a real.

2583
01:54:52,581 --> 01:54:55,520
But that Jennifer Lopez,
but that is a bottom.

2584
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:57,230
That's,
that's legit.

2585
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:00,890
That is Latina DNA.
That's exercise,

2586
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:03,110
squats,
dancing,

2587
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:08,680
and just the sheer love of Dick that 
just just comes out in everything.

2588
01:55:08,751 --> 01:55:09,560
She does like,
look at that.

2589
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:14,660
God Damn that woman's hot.
She's 48.

2590
01:55:14,661 --> 01:55:16,720
She can be 100 watts.
She's creative.

2591
01:55:16,730 --> 01:55:19,550
She's 100 and looks just like that.
People will line up to fuck her.

2592
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:22,160
Look at her skin.
She's an insane,

2593
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:25,580
insanely hot.
Some westworld shit while she's got like

2594
01:55:25,650 --> 01:55:30,650
super power DNA,
like there's no way you just get that 

2595
01:55:30,650 --> 01:55:32,300
with a regular person.
That's like super power DNA.

2596
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:33,100
Yeah.
No,

2597
01:55:33,110 --> 01:55:34,310
that's amazing.
Um,

2598
01:55:34,311 --> 01:55:35,690
what was the point?
It's like my skin.

2599
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:36,580
Oh,
see she,

2600
01:55:36,581 --> 01:55:39,650
she stayed natural man.
That's the crazy thing.

2601
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:45,010
Like there's so many women like and 
obviously not her stature where they're 

2602
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:45,010
like

2603
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:49,440
legit movie stars and stuff like that.
But like some of these pop gals or stuff

2604
01:55:49,441 --> 01:55:54,441
in so much fucking stuff into their ass 
that it wiggles a waterbed themselves.

2605
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:58,950
There was some.
What is the girl's name at Iggy Azalea.

2606
01:55:58,951 --> 01:56:02,510
Is that her name?
There's a video that she's doing what?

2607
01:56:02,511 --> 01:56:06,330
She's shaking her ass and it's literally
like trying to fuck in a waterbed.

2608
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:10,850
It's like whoosh.
Sound effects.

2609
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:14,820
It's like stop slow down.
Unless that's your real ass.

2610
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:19,650
In which case multiple policies.
Multiple.

2611
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:26,580
Realize your big ass shaming,
your body shaming and body shaming.

2612
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:31,050
But if you have a crazy body,
we're going to talk about it.

2613
01:56:31,590 --> 01:56:33,900
And if you're asked that giant people 
gonna talk about it.

2614
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:37,500
I guess it's body shaming to be.
No,

2615
01:56:37,540 --> 01:56:40,290
it's.
It's a surgery shaming.

2616
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:41,340
That's what it is.

2617
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,800
I think that's legitimate to surgery.
Shame.

2618
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:44,560
Sure.
Right.

2619
01:56:44,860 --> 01:56:49,270
If you call it like if it's like if we 
had done that earlier,

2620
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:54,300
would we have lost Michael Jackson?
Like if so many surgery shamed in like 

2621
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:54,300
soup a dude,
hey,

2622
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:54,300
hey,
hey,

2623
01:56:54,430 --> 01:56:56,400
stop.
Yeah.

2624
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,340
What do you.
What are you doing?

2625
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:59,950
What's going on?
Why does your nose doing this?

2626
01:57:00,130 --> 01:57:01,480
Once you go into why is he getting so 
small?

2627
01:57:02,170 --> 01:57:03,380
He doesn't know.
Started caving in.

2628
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:04,530
Met Everyone.
Was Katie

2629
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:06,850
aware?
Good Lord.

2630
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:11,880
Good Lord.
I mean I have a friend so I went to 

2631
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:14,670
dinner with a friend of mine.
She's awesome and I hadn't seen her for 

2632
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:18,490
awhile and she got plastic surgery,
plastic surgery and I didn't,

2633
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:23,760
she didn't bring it up.
I hadn't seen her for like five years 

2634
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:23,760
and I was,
it,

2635
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,650
it was noticeable.
Not Big Time but enough and I didn't 

2636
01:57:27,650 --> 01:57:31,051
know how to handle it.
I didn't know what to do so I just 

2637
01:57:31,051 --> 01:57:31,051
didn't say anything but I wanted to be 
like,

2638
01:57:31,051 --> 01:57:32,180
why?
But,

2639
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,520
you know,
once somebody already does it,

2640
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,640
it's kind of a moot point to be like,
Hey,

2641
01:57:36,641 --> 01:57:38,260
what you do,
go back.

2642
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:43,880
So I just let it go.
But it was really awkward because it 

2643
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:46,531
was,
she was already fucking gorgeous and 

2644
01:57:46,531 --> 01:57:49,481
then I was,
I don't know why she did that to 

2645
01:57:49,481 --> 01:57:49,481
herself.
So it was really,

2646
01:57:49,481 --> 01:57:51,700
it was really bizarre.
It's very bizarre feeling you.

2647
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:53,950
Have you experienced that?
Have you had seen?

2648
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:55,150
I mean,
you must've.

2649
01:57:55,470 --> 01:57:57,360
I have,
but my friend,

2650
01:57:57,361 --> 01:58:02,361
um,
even weirder was dating a girl in the 

2651
01:58:02,361 --> 01:58:03,570
Asian girl who got that eye surgery 
when.

2652
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:04,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

2653
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:07,860
And he hadn't seen her in a long time.
And then he actually told me about this.

2654
01:58:09,150 --> 01:58:11,400
Excuse me,
after we did the podcast,

2655
01:58:11,401 --> 01:58:14,220
we were talking about that eye surgery.
Remember when we showed it,

2656
01:58:14,221 --> 01:58:19,221
like how many Korean women in particular
are getting this crazy surgery where it 

2657
01:58:19,221 --> 01:58:19,650
changes your face.
It makes your eyes way bigger.

2658
01:58:19,651 --> 01:58:20,840
They cut your lids.
Oh,

2659
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,400
give you like this anime,
weird look.

2660
01:58:23,401 --> 01:58:25,170
And it's apparently super,
super popular.

2661
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:30,960
He hadn't seen her in awhile and then he
saw her and she had the thing done and 

2662
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,730
he didn't recognize her.
He was like,

2663
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:34,050
what?
Right.

2664
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:36,210
It was like,
it was off.

2665
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:41,480
It was like if I saw you and all of a 
sudden your eyes were giant and had to 

2666
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:41,480
go,
hey,

2667
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:42,010
what's up nick?
I could look at that.

2668
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:45,850
Wow.
You that.

2669
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:50,110
In that case it looks really good,
but I was going to say Bravo,

2670
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:52,900
but it's a,
it's a weird thing that is like super,

2671
01:58:52,901 --> 01:58:54,940
super common to get that look.
Right.

2672
01:58:55,150 --> 01:59:00,150
So they go from having.
Is that a bunch of different girls who 

2673
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:01,360
that scares the shit out of it.
We have a friend.

2674
01:59:01,361 --> 01:59:04,210
I just realized who got it done.
If that's a bunch of different girls.

2675
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:06,790
That freaked me the fuck out.
Have you seen him?

2676
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:08,320
No,
he got it done.

2677
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:12,210
You know what that is?
Of course he did the same thing with the

2678
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:13,360
eyes.
Let's keep it on the DL.

2679
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:15,670
Yeah,
that's why I wrote it down and show you.

2680
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:20,970
But that's like your.
She's becoming westernized to see this 

2681
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:21,100
is what they do.
It's so crazy,

2682
01:59:21,101 --> 01:59:26,101
dude.
They slice your lid and then they take 

2683
01:59:26,101 --> 01:59:26,101
like a chunk out of it.

2684
01:59:26,101 --> 01:59:27,460
Like say if you were cutting up a mango 
in a slices,

2685
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:33,030
they take a nice little mango slice and 
then stitch that bad boy up and then 

2686
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:37,351
your lids are just way smaller.
Says nations have different need for 

2687
01:59:38,771 --> 01:59:41,020
beauty choice.
As in Korea,

2688
01:59:41,021 --> 01:59:46,021
the land is small and crowded that 
everyone can see can look at each other 

2689
01:59:46,241 --> 01:59:50,530
in the face.
What the fuck he talking about?

2690
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:52,600
No,
you don't like having slanty eyes.

2691
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:54,670
That's all it is.
You don't like the way your eyes look.

2692
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:59,730
I get it.
Don't say crazy shit unless that's a 

2693
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:00,640
translation problem.
Nations have different need for beauty.

2694
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:02,170
Listen to this explanation.
Hey,

2695
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:04,450
why do you guys have so many eye 
surgeries?

2696
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:09,510
Well,
in Korea the land is small and crowded 

2697
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:09,730
and that everybody can see can look each
other.

2698
02:00:09,731 --> 02:00:12,640
In that case,
the fuck.

2699
02:00:12,641 --> 02:00:15,010
Did you say you're.
You're on pills?

2700
02:00:15,030 --> 02:00:16,390
Yeah,
they got faced.

2701
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:21,540
Well,
it must be some sort of a translation 

2702
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:21,640
issue.
I think so,

2703
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:23,160
yeah.
Because like if you said that to me,

2704
02:00:23,161 --> 02:00:24,340
I'm like,
nick is.

2705
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:26,920
I think he's gone crazy duties.
He doesn't.

2706
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:28,530
The sentences don't make sense.
No,

2707
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,760
Joe didn't do many sense.
I drunk my eyes.

2708
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:32,590
Couldn't see about your face.
Hi,

2709
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:36,940
what's wrong?
What was that weird?

2710
02:00:38,010 --> 02:00:38,380
Yeah.
No,

2711
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:40,450
my friend that I hadn't seen for awhile.
I didn't know what to do.

2712
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:45,451
I didn't know what to say,
so I just started screaming and threw 

2713
02:00:45,451 --> 02:00:47,130
hot water on her face.
Oh my God.

2714
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,520
As Taos that lives.
I could.

2715
02:00:48,521 --> 02:00:53,521
I started screaming.
We've got a boiling pot of water and 

2716
02:00:54,401 --> 02:00:59,401
started yelling at the restaurant and 
everybody stopped and I just ran out,

2717
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:06,240
jumped into cow.
Do you remember the night of the living 

2718
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,461
dead or not?
Dead invasion of the body snatchers when

2719
02:01:08,711 --> 02:01:11,500
someone would turn into one of those 
things and they would just be like,

2720
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:13,660
just something wrong.
Yeah.

2721
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:14,290
Like,
I don't know,

2722
02:01:14,291 --> 02:01:16,870
something's wrong with nick.
He just doesn't seem like nick anymore.

2723
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:22,430
There was a slight wrong.
Nothing you wouldn't wander off and 

2724
02:01:22,430 --> 02:01:26,560
really be an alien would find the pod,
but go find the pot under your bed,

2725
02:01:28,601 --> 02:01:33,120
like cobwebs and shit.
Like oh ill will.

2726
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:35,260
It's like the thing.
I remember the thing I do.

2727
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:37,000
That was the fucking.
It's the best movie.

2728
02:01:37,001 --> 02:01:39,830
One of my favorite movies of all time.
The original John Carpenter is.

2729
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:40,210
Fuck

2730
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,990
yeah.
Well that was so trippy.

2731
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:42,950
That was a no.
Yeah,

2732
02:01:42,951 --> 02:01:44,520
that was a remake,
but it was good.

2733
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:46,850
Awesome.
Phenomenal remake.

2734
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:51,260
But that was so trippy because you 
didn't know until they burn their blood.

2735
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:52,870
Who is an alien.
So you,

2736
02:01:52,871 --> 02:01:54,340
you're just walk around like,
Yo,

2737
02:01:54,341 --> 02:01:57,170
what happened to Gary?
I don't know.

2738
02:01:57,740 --> 02:01:58,580
You all right,
mark?

2739
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:00,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

2740
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:06,220
Just tired.
Didn't he get the dog to it became part 

2741
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:06,220
of the day.
Remember that when they burned it,

2742
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:11,170
they got the dog to technicals and shit.
Remember when they're doing an 

2743
02:02:11,811 --> 02:02:16,811
operations guy,
God remember when they're doing an 

2744
02:02:16,811 --> 02:02:20,771
operation on the guy in the chest,
opens up and becomes jaws and bites his 

2745
02:02:20,771 --> 02:02:21,980
arms on the.
What's it called?

2746
02:02:22,030 --> 02:02:24,440
The Fridge?
A little simulator.

2747
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:25,530
Fibulator,
defibrillators.

2748
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:30,570
And it's fucking this.
Go through it.

2749
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:34,340
Turned into jaws and open up and bit his
arms off.

2750
02:02:35,270 --> 02:02:37,340
Yeah.
That be ruled that movies.

2751
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:39,950
And it holds up even though the effects 
are bizarre.

2752
02:02:40,330 --> 02:02:43,040
It holds up.
It's still gives you like wicked anxiety

2753
02:02:43,130 --> 02:02:44,150
dude.
Kurt Russell.

2754
02:02:44,151 --> 02:02:46,520
And this movie is like one of my all 
time favorite.

2755
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:47,330
Yeah,
look at that.

2756
02:02:47,331 --> 02:02:51,040
That's crazy.
It opens up and bites on guys.

2757
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:53,400
Cheers.
Cheers.

2758
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:56,230
He could be.
He's not,

2759
02:02:56,370 --> 02:02:57,770
he shouldn't be.
Just say was,

2760
02:02:58,650 --> 02:03:01,870
is this a scene from cheers.
That's one of the last episodes.

2761
02:03:01,871 --> 02:03:03,680
So they cut them off.
Yeah.

2762
02:03:03,681 --> 02:03:04,970
They like,
these guys are going crazy.

2763
02:03:04,971 --> 02:03:09,971
Like Steve Your cutoff.
Remember it turned into a big spider 

2764
02:03:09,971 --> 02:03:09,971
thing.
Yeah.

2765
02:03:09,971 --> 02:03:14,550
That was Kinda the head popped up legs 
and started running around like a 

2766
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:14,550
spider.
That movie was scary as fuck,

2767
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:16,700
man.
How about the end and is the best?

2768
02:03:16,701 --> 02:03:18,740
Don't spoiler alert.
Spoiler.

2769
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,240
I didn't.
I didn't that Rick Baker.

2770
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:21,500
Yeah,
for sure.

2771
02:03:21,501 --> 02:03:26,501
That's Rick Baker.
He's the special effects guy that did 

2772
02:03:26,501 --> 02:03:26,570
American Werewolf in London is fucking 
ledge.

2773
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:27,540
He passed away,
right?

2774
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:29,780
I do not think he did.
I think he's still alive.

2775
02:03:29,781 --> 02:03:30,270
Oh,
sorry.

2776
02:03:30,271 --> 02:03:31,790
Right.
I believe Rick Baker still alive.

2777
02:03:31,850 --> 02:03:33,410
I think he was just working on 
something.

2778
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:36,800
Something that's going on right now.
I forget what it was,

2779
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:38,020
but I feel like,
uh,

2780
02:03:38,470 --> 02:03:40,490
there's some new project that I just 
read something about.

2781
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:43,850
I forget what the.
Goddamn it.

2782
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,100
Did you see the new version of the 
thing?

2783
02:03:46,101 --> 02:03:47,660
They did a third version.
I saw it.

2784
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:49,910
I thought it was good.
I did not like it.

2785
02:03:50,330 --> 02:03:51,800
Oh dear.
You know,

2786
02:03:51,801 --> 02:03:53,720
I just thought it was.
I wanted to like it,

2787
02:03:53,810 --> 02:03:55,400
but I just thought it.
I thought it was bad.

2788
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:55,970
Okay.
Bro.

2789
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:58,670
People get mad if you don't like things 
they like,

2790
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:02,030
yeah bro.
You know,

2791
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,850
maybe you suck.
You saw they turn it on,

2792
02:04:04,851 --> 02:04:07,930
you get mad at you,
but also I'm somebody who were like,

2793
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:09,290
I wanna like shit.

2794
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:10,400
So like when people are like,
oh,

2795
02:04:10,401 --> 02:04:11,420
you're just a hater,
it's like,

2796
02:04:11,421 --> 02:04:16,421
no,
I fucking go to a movie because I want 

2797
02:04:16,421 --> 02:04:18,761
to like it.
If I watch something like I don't want 

2798
02:04:18,761 --> 02:04:18,761
to hate something,
why would I go?

2799
02:04:18,761 --> 02:04:20,330
Why would I make an effort to go to a 
movie to hate it?

2800
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:23,840
That's fucking retarded.
I agreed to go and then I'm like,

2801
02:04:23,841 --> 02:04:24,240
oh,
this is,

2802
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:26,600
I don't like this.
And then people go,

2803
02:04:26,601 --> 02:04:27,470
no you don't.
And I'm like,

2804
02:04:27,471 --> 02:04:28,040
no,
I don't.

2805
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:29,030
I just,
I didn't like it.

2806
02:04:29,031 --> 02:04:30,640
It wasn't,
you know.

2807
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:33,380
And I'm on your side Bro.
Thank you Jesus.

2808
02:04:33,381 --> 02:04:36,260
Everyone so touchy.
Yeah,

2809
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:38,010
that's ridiculous.
Did you see life

2810
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:39,890
with Ryan Reynolds?
I did see life.

2811
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:41,580
Did you like it?
I liked it.

2812
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:43,920
Did you like it Jamie?
I liked it.

2813
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:49,010
I put it on twitter and I got attacked.
People like your flow Canadian chose 

2814
02:04:49,010 --> 02:04:49,080
sucked.
That movie.

2815
02:04:49,081 --> 02:04:51,570
Blue was stupid,
was cliche.

2816
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:56,010
Same Old Shit was a rebuff of aliens.
There's a lot of people that liked it,

2817
02:04:56,011 --> 02:05:01,011
but it was like,
it seemed like there was a good 

2818
02:05:01,011 --> 02:05:01,011
percentage of them that hated it.
Well,

2819
02:05:01,011 --> 02:05:01,440
here's the thing,
it's like that critique where people go,

2820
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:02,190
it's,
you know,

2821
02:05:02,191 --> 02:05:03,360
they took this,
this and it's like,

2822
02:05:03,361 --> 02:05:08,361
yeah,
movies do borrow a certain elements and 

2823
02:05:08,361 --> 02:05:08,361
especially like life had certain stuff 
that,

2824
02:05:08,361 --> 02:05:09,330
yeah,
devices that they used,

2825
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:11,100
but it's also,
it's still,

2826
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:12,840
you just have to go.
Okay.

2827
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:16,890
And then like sit back and just enjoy 
performances and enjoy what they made.

2828
02:05:16,891 --> 02:05:18,930
It's a fucking really well shot movie.

2829
02:05:18,990 --> 02:05:23,990
You know what it really highlighted to 
me that television shows like contagious

2830
02:05:24,061 --> 02:05:24,960
bro.
Now you're doing it.

2831
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:26,000
Yeah.
Thanks.

2832
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:29,370
Television shows like house of cards in 
game of thrones,

2833
02:05:29,371 --> 02:05:32,730
these serial shows,
they've ruined movies.

2834
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:38,180
This is why,
because like to tell a story in 90 

2835
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:40,221
minutes or so limited,
you can only get so invested in the 

2836
02:05:40,221 --> 02:05:43,371
character.
There's only so many different plot 

2837
02:05:43,371 --> 02:05:45,771
twists you can have.
Like especially like this sort of a 

2838
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:45,771
genre,
right?

2839
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:49,341
Like you take an alien life form,
it gets onboard board that people and 

2840
02:05:49,341 --> 02:05:49,341
tries to kill him.
Okay.

2841
02:05:49,341 --> 02:05:50,160
How many,
how many times have we seen that?

2842
02:05:50,161 --> 02:05:52,140
We've seen that a thousand times in 
movies,

2843
02:05:52,141 --> 02:05:52,660
right?
Right.

2844
02:05:52,710 --> 02:05:57,710
So you're gonna run into a bunch of pr 
and you've got to jam it all into 90 

2845
02:05:57,710 --> 02:05:57,710
minutes.
Like there's certain things that have to

2846
02:05:57,710 --> 02:05:59,940
be like plot mechanisms.
They have to take place.

2847
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:01,740
Like the alien has to attack the first 
person.

2848
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:04,020
You're going to see it coming.
There's going to be like a bunch of shit

2849
02:06:04,021 --> 02:06:06,260
going on.
You have to adhere to certain cliches.

2850
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,850
Got Devices.
That's that.

2851
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:12,860
People that the Jew like prometheus's I 
did like I didn't like is I didn't love 

2852
02:06:12,860 --> 02:06:14,790
it and I liked the new alien.
I didn't see the new alien,

2853
02:06:14,791 --> 02:06:16,910
but I heard it's awesome.
It's great.

2854
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,280
I mean I liked both of them.
I got a lot of shit for that.

2855
02:06:20,281 --> 02:06:21,750
People are like,
you're a fucking idiot.

2856
02:06:22,470 --> 02:06:24,270
And I was like,
easy grandma.

2857
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:27,390
Be hanging around with me.
And what is that?

2858
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:29,000
No,
it wasn't my ground.

2859
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:34,040
Nobody know,
but people I do hang out with people 

2860
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:34,040
that are critical like director friends 
and shit,

2861
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:38,571
but oh,
directors of the worst to watch a movie 

2862
02:06:38,571 --> 02:06:38,571
with.
Yeah,

2863
02:06:38,571 --> 02:06:38,571
they're pretty bad director people 
because they're,

2864
02:06:38,571 --> 02:06:41,220
they're so beyond critical,
but like I'm critical of comedy.

2865
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:46,220
It's like when I go to comedies,
I walk out of a lot of them because I 

2866
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:46,220
just.
I'm like,

2867
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:49,570
you know what the worst is if you.
You're around actors that haven't made 

2868
02:06:49,570 --> 02:06:52,260
it.
Actors that like barely work negative.

2869
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:54,660
I don't even understand that choice.
Yeah,

2870
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:55,620
that's right.
Yeah.

2871
02:06:55,621 --> 02:06:57,270
That's really bad.
Whatever happened to his career,

2872
02:06:57,870 --> 02:06:59,280
you're like,
that's Daniel Day Lewis.

2873
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:04,770
What's his middle of the day?
And his crew are really fell off after 

2874
02:07:04,770 --> 02:07:09,291
that movie.
Somebody said that about the dude and 

2875
02:07:09,291 --> 02:07:11,831
Jurassic Park.
My keys in fucking Jurassic Park.

2876
02:07:12,211 --> 02:07:14,190
It's one of the biggest movies of all 
time.

2877
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:18,720
Everyone's career falls off after 
Jurassic Park.

2878
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:21,090
Okay.
It's no way to get bigger.

2879
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:22,290
You stupid.
Fuck.

2880
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:27,620
Like I'm sure the guy probably did a lot
of movies after Jurassic fucking park 

2881
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:33,170
also.
Maybe he made enough money that he 

2882
02:07:33,170 --> 02:07:33,840
doesn't have to do movies anymore.
You twat right?

2883
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:37,120
Yeah.
He's his fucking Jurassic dollars

2884
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:39,520
and can I have my latte?
I'm tired of this.

2885
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:42,680
Who's his choice?
His career.

2886
02:07:42,681 --> 02:07:46,930
His career totally dropped off.
Did you say nonfat nonfat soy,

2887
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:51,400
nonfat soy sugar free please?
Yeah,

2888
02:07:51,401 --> 02:07:52,060
it is funny.
Like,

2889
02:07:52,061 --> 02:07:54,570
I'll uh,
I'll do interviews for stuff and they'll

2890
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:56,300
be like,
yeah man,

2891
02:07:56,301 --> 02:07:59,470
I'm just looking over your stuff.
Why did you do that movie?

2892
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:02,800
And I'm like,
because my friend was in it and he asked

2893
02:08:02,801 --> 02:08:07,020
me to do it because I suck.
Like I fucking.

2894
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:12,540
Yeah.
I'm friends with people and they were 

2895
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:12,540
doing a project and they're like,
hey,

2896
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:12,540
you want to do this?
I'm like,

2897
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:13,450
all right,
I'm not going to go.

2898
02:08:13,451 --> 02:08:15,070
No,
fuck you man.

2899
02:08:15,810 --> 02:08:16,990
My friend.
Like,

2900
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:19,930
yeah,
there's other variables besides,

2901
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:21,730
you know.
Yeah man.

2902
02:08:21,731 --> 02:08:24,750
I was willing to do your assassin show.
Exactly there.

2903
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:26,170
It says right there.
You would do that.

2904
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:27,840
Trust me.
Exactly.

2905
02:08:27,850 --> 02:08:28,630
I didn't even look into it.

2906
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:34,410
Yeah.
That could find out like halfway into 

2907
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:35,830
the filming,
Nick eats a pound of adderall a day,

2908
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:38,120
a full pound of adderall.
They,

2909
02:08:38,121 --> 02:08:39,790
they,
they deliver it in pounds.

2910
02:08:39,970 --> 02:08:44,970
He just on adderall.
He doesn't even know he's making a 

2911
02:08:44,970 --> 02:08:44,970
movie.
He just found out it's a movie.

2912
02:08:44,970 --> 02:08:47,260
I thought he was in a dream about making
a movie.

2913
02:08:47,270 --> 02:08:49,090
You just found out he's actually making 
a movie.

2914
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:51,430
He has no,
he thought it was at the fit,

2915
02:08:51,431 --> 02:08:54,640
so he hasn't slept in a year.
Just one year,

2916
02:08:54,641 --> 02:08:59,641
no sleep.
This guy puts adderall on his foot and 

2917
02:08:59,641 --> 02:09:02,341
then kicks it in the next mouth thing.
If you didn't sleep for a long time but 

2918
02:09:02,341 --> 02:09:02,930
you were still up moving,
you would probably just start.

2919
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:04,240
Just start hallucinating,
right?

2920
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:07,630
Isn't that what people did right?
Was the story.

2921
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:12,190
I did a show in Tahoe riders on the 
storm riders.

2922
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:17,520
I did a show in Tahoe and I forgot to be
hydrated so I didn't get hydrated at 

2923
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:17,520
all.

2924
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:21,130
And so I didn't drink any water and I 
was drinking on the plane that me and my

2925
02:09:21,131 --> 02:09:26,131
buddy got an arena and he drove a Tahoe.
We were drinking in Tahoe and I did my 

2926
02:09:26,131 --> 02:09:26,470
show.
We just kept drinking.

2927
02:09:26,471 --> 02:09:30,110
I didn't drink any water.
And then I got back.

2928
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:33,300
I was up like,
I dunno,

2929
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:35,700
maybe like 15 hours.
And then,

2930
02:09:35,701 --> 02:09:40,701
uh,
I kept drinking and like didn't really 

2931
02:09:40,701 --> 02:09:40,701
think about it.
And I'm at the Casino,

2932
02:09:40,701 --> 02:09:42,070
I'm having fun.
And then I started feeling sick and then

2933
02:09:42,071 --> 02:09:44,470
um,
I tried to go to bed and I can't.

2934
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:50,010
And then,
so I'm awake throughout the night and 

2935
02:09:50,010 --> 02:09:52,111
then the next day I'm like still awake 
and I'm like kind of panicking now 

2936
02:09:52,111 --> 02:09:52,180
because I haven't slept for like over 24
hours.

2937
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:53,140
And now I have,
like,

2938
02:09:53,141 --> 02:09:58,141
I've realized that I have altitude 
sickness because I had my puking and 

2939
02:09:58,141 --> 02:09:58,141
then I haven't,
so I'm starting to drink water.

2940
02:09:58,141 --> 02:10:03,090
So I got,
I drank and I had alcohol poisoning and 

2941
02:10:03,090 --> 02:10:06,271
altitude sickness and sleep deprivation.
So I flew home to La and I had slept for

2942
02:10:07,271 --> 02:10:10,180
like 30 fucking six hours and I'm in my 
bed.

2943
02:10:10,181 --> 02:10:15,181
I'm like,
I got to go to sleep so I get in my bed 

2944
02:10:15,181 --> 02:10:15,181
and then,
uh,

2945
02:10:15,181 --> 02:10:17,290
I just start hearing like music and like
all this stuff and like people,

2946
02:10:17,291 --> 02:10:19,900
like there was a party next door but 
there was no party.

2947
02:10:20,530 --> 02:10:21,970
And then so I was like,
what the fuck?

2948
02:10:22,060 --> 02:10:25,360
And then I'm lying in my bed and I just 
hear pounding on my floor.

2949
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:27,430
And I was like,
what the fuck?

2950
02:10:27,431 --> 02:10:29,200
And I heard like legitimate,
like pounding.

2951
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:34,770
And I was like totally awake and I 
realized I hadn't slept and then I like 

2952
02:10:34,770 --> 02:10:36,260
took like a sunlight,
some sleeping,

2953
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:39,260
like at some Nyquil or something.
And then I finally got to bed cheese.

2954
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:40,940
But it was super weird,
man.

2955
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:44,330
Yeah.
I've heard people that do those races,

2956
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:49,360
those ultra marathon races,
they start seeing shit that's not their 

2957
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:49,640
cam.
Didn't have that happen to him.

2958
02:10:49,641 --> 02:10:54,641
But I've heard other people,
they see people on the side of the road 

2959
02:10:54,641 --> 02:10:56,510
waving at them that aren't even there.
Really did altitude we ever got out suit

2960
02:10:56,511 --> 02:10:58,910
fucks with me real bad.
My friend Ben,

2961
02:10:59,090 --> 02:11:00,770
Ben,
Brian who was on the show last week,

2962
02:11:00,970 --> 02:11:04,010
the week before last,
he was talking about how he was in Nepal

2963
02:11:04,070 --> 02:11:09,070
and he was getting out to sickness while
he's in Nepal and he saw a baby on the 

2964
02:11:09,070 --> 02:11:11,700
side of the road and there was no baby.
And he saw a wolf saw wolves.

2965
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:13,130
Like two guys.
There's a wolf is a wolf.

2966
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:14,480
And they're like,
oh my God,

2967
02:11:14,690 --> 02:11:17,540
how many know what he's way the fuck up 
there.

2968
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,460
Yeah,
bugs are bad.

2969
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:20,900
You know,
he's above 13,000

2970
02:11:20,901 --> 02:11:22,110
feet.
And uh,

2971
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:23,780
and he was sick too.
He was.

2972
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:28,840
Everybody got food poisoning.
So he calls food poisoning and altitude 

2973
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:28,840
sickness.
Oh.

2974
02:11:28,890 --> 02:11:30,710
And it was just seeing things.
It's not a baby.

2975
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:32,330
He's like,
you guys don't see that baby.

2976
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:37,050
Nobody was like,
oh my God,

2977
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:40,140
you see a baby,
you see a baby,

2978
02:11:40,141 --> 02:11:41,640
it's a baby.
Just chill on the side of the road.

2979
02:11:41,650 --> 02:11:42,420
It'd be like,
look,

2980
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:45,060
look closer at the baby.
And then I just pushed him off.

2981
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:47,630
Deuces you,
that Guy Deuces dot.

2982
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:50,550
You're the one who cuts his losses.
Like this guy is not going to make it.

2983
02:11:50,551 --> 02:11:53,150
Bang.
I've got to think about survival.

2984
02:11:53,170 --> 02:11:53,910
The group,
man,

2985
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,920
your buddy would not survive around me.
Do last.

2986
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:00,000
And think how you would've handled 
things differently.

2987
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:02,160
I never saw last summer.
So I went up to sewed,

2988
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:05,470
never saw one episode.
I've heard that.

2989
02:12:05,471 --> 02:12:07,450
I watch it.
Yes,

2990
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:10,720
up until like the last season and then 
quit.

2991
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:15,790
I heard it.
I heard it kind of jumped ship last 

2992
02:12:15,790 --> 02:12:19,450
season.
It was like they're all standing around 

2993
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:19,450
while there's a pool that brings you 
back to life.

2994
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:20,140
And no one's freaking out.
Like,

2995
02:12:20,141 --> 02:12:21,490
what is wrong?
What the fuck?

2996
02:12:21,491 --> 02:12:23,620
Kind of show my watching.
Did you guys forget?

2997
02:12:23,940 --> 02:12:26,620
The people have to believe this shit.
Okay.

2998
02:12:26,621 --> 02:12:31,621
What do you do?
They're just standing around there and 

2999
02:12:31,621 --> 02:12:33,770
like that perfect order that you do on 
sitcoms was the person talking here and 

3000
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:35,980
there's another person talking about 
with that never happens in real life.

3001
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:37,670
The perfect blocking.
Yeah.

3002
02:12:37,710 --> 02:12:42,710
Perfect.
Blocking and we let people look at each 

3003
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:42,710
other.
You fucking asshole.

3004
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:43,120
You all standing around.
No one's freaking out.

3005
02:12:43,121 --> 02:12:46,210
There's a pond that brings people back 
to life and you guys are just phoning it

3006
02:12:46,211 --> 02:12:46,360
in.

3007
02:12:47,050 --> 02:12:49,690
I think that's why I jumped ship and 
excited to see derailed.

3008
02:12:49,691 --> 02:12:50,970
Super Bad.
And then I heard the.

3009
02:12:50,990 --> 02:12:55,510
The writers didn't think it was going to
go that long and so they ran out of shit

3010
02:12:55,560 --> 02:13:00,560
that.
So that somebody told me that they were 

3011
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:00,560
like,
yeah,

3012
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:00,560
we didn't think it was.
We weren't really ready

3013
02:13:00,990 --> 02:13:02,280
in the beginning though.
The beginning.

3014
02:13:02,281 --> 02:13:05,190
It's so good.
It's such a good show for the first,

3015
02:13:05,191 --> 02:13:09,030
like she knows how many seasons I binge 
watched was like five or six,

3016
02:13:09,031 --> 02:13:09,750
right?
Yeah.

3017
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:12,660
Up until the last season it started to 
fall apart.

3018
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:15,150
He died,
I fell apart,

3019
02:13:15,151 --> 02:13:18,240
spoiler alert.
It's that many people on the show.

3020
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:21,680
And our boy dominic who was on the show 
has been on this podcast.

3021
02:13:21,681 --> 02:13:22,730
My funny,
my buddy,

3022
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,210
uh,
Jorge Garcia.

3023
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:27,720
And then what happened to kind of 
overweight,

3024
02:13:27,721 --> 02:13:29,700
uh,
won the lottery and there's the girl,

3025
02:13:29,701 --> 02:13:31,010
that girl from last.
She did it.

3026
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:32,070
Oh,
she was one of the girls

3027
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,010
in the hobbit movie.
Yeah.

3028
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:40,670
Yeah.
She was like an Elf elf chick hot as 

3029
02:13:40,670 --> 02:13:40,670
fuck.
She the elephants.

3030
02:13:40,670 --> 02:13:41,070
And then.
So as Dominic Monaghan.

3031
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:42,660
Yeah.
He was enough to.

3032
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:43,730
She was hot.
No,

3033
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:45,090
no.
Dominic was something else.

3034
02:13:45,091 --> 02:13:46,320
Wasn't the hobbit.
He was a hobbit.

3035
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:48,570
Yeah.
One of my favorite moments.

3036
02:13:48,571 --> 02:13:50,310
I was in an additional one time years 
ago,

3037
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:55,580
and the Lord of the rings,
you just come out and I had seen it and 

3038
02:13:55,580 --> 02:13:56,550
we were auditioning for some shitty 
movie and he was in the waiting room and

3039
02:13:56,551 --> 02:13:59,070
they came out and they're like,
we're running about 40 minutes behind.

3040
02:13:59,130 --> 02:14:00,330
I was like,
are you fucking kidding me?

3041
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,530
He was like,
Jesus,

3042
02:14:01,531 --> 02:14:02,220
man,
what the hell?

3043
02:14:02,550 --> 02:14:03,360
And I go,
why?

3044
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:05,340
What are you doing here?
And he goes,

3045
02:14:05,341 --> 02:14:06,100
what do you mean?
I go,

3046
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,760
you were just in Lord of the rings.
And he goes,

3047
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:09,390
yeah.
And he goes,

3048
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:12,510
and I go there,
they shouldn't make you wait 40 minutes,

3049
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:12,960
dude.

3050
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:15,420
That would be fucking mad.
And he was like,

3051
02:14:15,810 --> 02:14:16,890
you're right.
I go,

3052
02:14:16,891 --> 02:14:17,850
yeah,
no shit.

3053
02:14:18,570 --> 02:14:20,040
I go fucking call your agent,
man.

3054
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:23,790
You're a fucking in the rear.
One of the rings of the Lord.

3055
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:28,840
Will you do doing that?
Just to kick him out of there so that 

3056
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:28,840
you can get the.
No,

3057
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:28,840
I would have let him go in front of me.
I'm the good guy.

3058
02:14:28,950 --> 02:14:30,120
Wow.
I was like,

3059
02:14:30,150 --> 02:14:31,230
I would have been failed.
I was like,

3060
02:14:31,231 --> 02:14:36,231
dude,
you're in the biggest movie of the 

3061
02:14:36,231 --> 02:14:36,231
world.
Put that picture back up once.

3062
02:14:36,231 --> 02:14:37,620
See something here.
I forgot all these characters.

3063
02:14:37,621 --> 02:14:39,600
Now remembering them when I'm seeing 
this again.

3064
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:42,690
Remember the Middle Eastern guy was 
named his name.

3065
02:14:43,230 --> 02:14:48,230
He's a bad motherfucker.
He was a first Middle Eastern do to get 

3066
02:14:48,230 --> 02:14:49,440
the fuck white chicks in a big time 
show,

3067
02:14:49,441 --> 02:14:51,330
right?
He had a hot white girlfriend did there.

3068
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:52,470
Keith urban is on it.

3069
02:14:53,070 --> 02:14:54,210
No,
that's not keith.

3070
02:14:54,211 --> 02:14:57,360
Urban pro.
Dare you and then there's the Korean guy

3071
02:14:57,630 --> 02:15:01,410
who was in Hawaii five o and he just,
they want to believe in Hawaii.

3072
02:15:02,070 --> 02:15:07,070
They're pissed off.
They were saying that they don't get 

3073
02:15:07,070 --> 02:15:09,051
enough respect like the Asian actors 
weren't getting paid as much as the 

3074
02:15:09,051 --> 02:15:09,090
white actors and Hawaii.
Five o.

3075
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:11,100
That was the complaint.
I don't know if it's true.

3076
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:13,530
I don't know if I would complainant.
If I was on a show in Hawaii,

3077
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:14,220
I'd be like,
yeah,

3078
02:15:14,230 --> 02:15:17,100
just pay me and fucking Doritos.
I don't give a shit dude.

3079
02:15:17,130 --> 02:15:20,250
I think after awhile you just get tired 
of everything you're doing.

3080
02:15:20,970 --> 02:15:24,800
If you're doing somebody show and in 
paradise you tired of being impaired.

3081
02:15:24,801 --> 02:15:26,430
I said,
bet right.

3082
02:15:26,431 --> 02:15:31,431
Don't they say people get island fever.
They moved to like a Wahoo and then 

3083
02:15:31,431 --> 02:15:33,780
after awhile I'm like,
I gotta get Outta here.

3084
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:37,090
I can't do that as well.
Right.

3085
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:40,230
I guess I don't know if I could.
I would love to do that.

3086
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:45,740
That's a fever I would not mind getting.
Do you see yourself living in Maui in 

3087
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:45,740
the future?
Yeah,

3088
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:47,130
my buddy.
We'll put a bar there.

3089
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,080
You buddy opened a bar in Maui?
Yeah.

3090
02:15:49,081 --> 02:15:49,770
And he said,
um,

3091
02:15:49,820 --> 02:15:51,180
I opened a bar,
it's a true story,

3092
02:15:51,181 --> 02:15:52,980
and I go,
can I get a job?

3093
02:15:53,570 --> 02:15:54,300
And he goes,
what do you mean?

3094
02:15:54,301 --> 02:15:55,010
I go,
I don't know,

3095
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:56,700
can I?
What can I bartend?

3096
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:58,140
What if you was like,
yeah,

3097
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:01,500
the House Mc.
I don't want to fucking be the house.

3098
02:16:01,501 --> 02:16:06,501
I'm seeing them just have a microphone 
and start talking to people away from 

3099
02:16:06,501 --> 02:16:07,650
Bob.
That sounds horrible.

3100
02:16:07,651 --> 02:16:11,190
That went from really per Paris paradise
sick.

3101
02:16:11,590 --> 02:16:12,760
Is that a word?
Yeah.

3102
02:16:12,780 --> 02:16:13,690
To know?
Yeah.

3103
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:14,630
I don't want to be a fucking.
I don't know.

3104
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:16,120
I don't want a microphone.
It would be nice to like,

3105
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:17,790
bartend and be like,
yeah,

3106
02:16:17,791 --> 02:16:20,010
Robin Cook a couple of my tabs over 
here.

3107
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:22,050
Just be like cocktail.
You know what I mean?

3108
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:27,080
They can give you a sweet apartment 
above the bar and you wake up with a 

3109
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:28,140
pounding headache every day because 
you're just drinking yourself to death.

3110
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:29,710
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

3111
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:30,370
Sign

3112
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:30,940
me up.

3113
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:33,700
Sound of the water crashing into the 
bottom of the building.

3114
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:40,050
Hit some way is like stone pylons and 
hold this bar up and it's elevated over,

3115
02:16:40,451 --> 02:16:43,630
partially elevated over the water.
Eat some leeching off the tree.

3116
02:16:43,631 --> 02:16:46,120
Fresh leg.
It's really a contradiction.

3117
02:16:46,510 --> 02:16:48,460
It's a conundrum because you're in 
paradise.

3118
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,740
It's the most beautiful place on earth.
It's peaceful.

3119
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:56,020
You're relaxed,
you've given away all your personal 

3120
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:56,020
belongings.
You're a pure minimalist.

3121
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:57,100
Now what do you have?
You have a few pairs of shorts,

3122
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:59,620
some flip flops,
and a microphone.

3123
02:16:59,770 --> 02:17:01,480
Case.
The microphone downstairs breaks because

3124
02:17:01,481 --> 02:17:03,370
that's what you do.
Now you go down and talk to people.

3125
02:17:03,970 --> 02:17:06,370
Go down tonight,
Nick d do standup anymore.

3126
02:17:06,550 --> 02:17:08,110
Well,
can I do stand up?

3127
02:17:08,270 --> 02:17:09,670
I don't have a mic,
but you know,

3128
02:17:09,671 --> 02:17:10,780
they never know when I'm coming.

3129
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:13,890
I have a mic.
So yeah,

3130
02:17:13,891 --> 02:17:18,891
it's kind of whenever I want to do it.
Immediately you telling me you wouldn't 

3131
02:17:18,891 --> 02:17:21,690
go to a bar if you knew that every night
Joey Diaz was going to take a microphone

3132
02:17:21,691 --> 02:17:23,490
and just start walking through the crowd
and talking shit.

3133
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:25,950
A hundred percent.
I would do that 100 percent.

3134
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:27,100
Yeah.
But that's Joey Diaz.

3135
02:17:27,180 --> 02:17:27,470
Like,
um,

3136
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:29,460
I wouldn't be good at that.
It wouldn't be now,

3137
02:17:29,461 --> 02:17:31,500
but you got to get better.
Okay.

3138
02:17:31,730 --> 02:17:35,840
Can you get better at being a bar guy?
Bar EMC?

3139
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:38,280
EMC.
It's a skill man.

3140
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:39,690
Like anything else,
like playing golf,

3141
02:17:39,691 --> 02:17:41,400
like jerking off,
you get better at it.

3142
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:44,100
Right?
It doesn't make sense.

3143
02:17:44,520 --> 02:17:46,620
It doesn't,
but I think it does.

3144
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:48,780
No.
Maybe you could just be like,

3145
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:51,480
you turn to a singer.
Everybody's like Nikki.

3146
02:17:51,481 --> 02:17:54,160
She really tell jokes again.
No Man.

3147
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:57,740
I'm Jimmy Buffett songs.
What?

3148
02:17:57,790 --> 02:17:59,820
I make my voice though.

3149
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:03,180
So I'm like diarrhea and have everybody 
clap.

3150
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:05,160
Yeah,
he could have like funny songs.

3151
02:18:05,410 --> 02:18:07,080
Yeah.
That's the move,

3152
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:07,990
right?
I'm on board.

3153
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:09,750
Right?
I hope I get to go to dinner.

3154
02:18:09,751 --> 02:18:10,620
Joe,
where you going?

3155
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:13,310
I'm going to leave right now.
You can play.

3156
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:14,880
It's pretty soon.
You're going to a vegan place.

3157
02:18:14,881 --> 02:18:15,960
Dude.
You're healthy and up.

3158
02:18:16,020 --> 02:18:16,740
What are you doing?
I know,

3159
02:18:16,741 --> 02:18:17,940
I'm trying to,
uh,

3160
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:22,230
just,
just kind of get back into shape.

3161
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:25,230
Yeah.
So getting back into the gym and uh,

3162
02:18:25,231 --> 02:18:26,910
I'm in.
I've been pretty good with my diet.

3163
02:18:26,911 --> 02:18:30,600
I'm getting kind of fascinated by diet.
So I've been off dairy for eight years.

3164
02:18:30,650 --> 02:18:31,560
Whoa.
And then,

3165
02:18:31,561 --> 02:18:33,630
uh,
I've been pretty much cut out sugar.

3166
02:18:33,631 --> 02:18:36,450
I have like dark chocolate if I really 
like start craving shit,

3167
02:18:37,140 --> 02:18:39,660
but I'm trying to like really get my 
body.

3168
02:18:40,050 --> 02:18:42,600
I'm like really fascinated by diets by 
new fascination.

3169
02:18:43,380 --> 02:18:44,460
Well,
you find the difference,

3170
02:18:44,461 --> 02:18:45,500
right?
You eat healthy.

3171
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:48,570
The difference.
When I quit eating dairy and it was some

3172
02:18:48,571 --> 02:18:53,571
random dude at a juice bar who worked 
there and I was always sick and he was 

3173
02:18:53,571 --> 02:18:53,670
like,
hey man,

3174
02:18:53,671 --> 02:18:55,140
you're always six words in.
And I go,

3175
02:18:55,141 --> 02:18:56,070
yeah.
And he was like,

3176
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:57,780
do you eat a lot of dairy?
And I go,

3177
02:18:57,781 --> 02:18:58,350
yeah,
he goes,

3178
02:18:58,351 --> 02:18:59,430
do this.
He goes,

3179
02:18:59,431 --> 02:19:01,690
quit eating dairy for two weeks.
See how you feel.

3180
02:19:01,710 --> 02:19:03,490
He's like cold Turkey.
And I go,

3181
02:19:03,491 --> 02:19:04,320
okay,
fuck it.

3182
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:06,870
So I did.
And I haven't been back in eight years.

3183
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:08,940
My sleep,
everything.

3184
02:19:08,941 --> 02:19:12,870
My stomach never got sick,
never got migraines.

3185
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:16,260
It changed everything.
And then I got super fascinated by that.

3186
02:19:16,261 --> 02:19:18,030
I still drank by tits off,
you know what I mean?

3187
02:19:18,270 --> 02:19:21,480
Have you tried raw milk?
No.

3188
02:19:21,570 --> 02:19:26,570
Apparently some people have an issue 
with homogenized and pasteurized milk 

3189
02:19:26,570 --> 02:19:28,280
and they don't have it with raw milk or 
they don't have it with goats

3190
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:30,710
milk too.
Especially raw goat's milk.

3191
02:19:30,711 --> 02:19:33,980
I've heard about goats milk.
I just want to just bypass all of it.

3192
02:19:33,981 --> 02:19:36,090
I do like almond milk and rice milk.
Yeah,

3193
02:19:36,140 --> 02:19:37,430
well it's,
it's a,

3194
02:19:37,431 --> 02:19:42,431
it's an ethical thing to bypass to if 
you really stop and think about it 

3195
02:19:42,431 --> 02:19:44,330
because there's something fucking creepy
about mass produced like handles yanking

3196
02:19:44,331 --> 02:19:47,840
on titties and these cows that are like 
kind of perpetually pregnant.

3197
02:19:47,841 --> 02:19:49,970
Like isn't that what they are?
They're the cows.

3198
02:19:49,971 --> 02:19:52,280
Like they're constantly nursing.
Right.

3199
02:19:52,281 --> 02:19:52,850
So they're,
they're,

3200
02:19:52,851 --> 02:19:56,900
they make them get knocked up nor to 
have the milk come out.

3201
02:19:56,901 --> 02:19:57,980
Right.
The milk doesn't just come,

3202
02:19:58,230 --> 02:20:00,050
it's out in there.
Their nursing.

3203
02:20:00,140 --> 02:20:01,910
It's a little weird.
I don't know.

3204
02:20:01,911 --> 02:20:03,470
It's weird.
It's fucking weird.

3205
02:20:03,650 --> 02:20:08,650
But I want to try to fuck with going 
Vegan for a little bit and just see how 

3206
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:08,870
it is.
So you know,

3207
02:20:09,060 --> 02:20:10,760
so far how long you been doing it?

3208
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:13,460
Two days.
But I mean,

3209
02:20:13,461 --> 02:20:18,350
for the most part,
I don't really eat a lot of red meat and

3210
02:20:18,351 --> 02:20:20,450
uh,
I mean I eat like chicken and fish,

3211
02:20:20,451 --> 02:20:25,451
but I'm going to try to go vegan.
I'm going to try to do it for like two 

3212
02:20:25,451 --> 02:20:25,451
weeks,
you know,

3213
02:20:25,451 --> 02:20:27,460
one way that you can get protein that's 
very ethical and um,

3214
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:32,500
you don't even have to think about it 
too much is scallops and muscles and 

3215
02:20:32,751 --> 02:20:36,110
things along those lines when you eat,
I'm the fuck.

3216
02:20:36,111 --> 02:20:39,740
Are they called mollusks?
Is that the word?

3217
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:41,960
Shellfish.
Shellfish is what I'm looking for.

3218
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:47,380
Shellfish in particular,
like especially like clams and oysters,

3219
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:51,260
oysters and things along those lines.
They're so primitive.

3220
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:54,890
They don't even have nervous systems.
We just think of them as like an animal,

3221
02:20:54,891 --> 02:20:57,800
like a living creature because they can 
move and close this.

3222
02:20:58,010 --> 02:21:03,010
But a venus fly trap is probably way 
more sophisticated and it's a plant way 

3223
02:21:03,741 --> 02:21:06,080
more sophisticated in organism than 
that.

3224
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:07,790
And then,
especially if you're talking about those

3225
02:21:07,791 --> 02:21:12,791
acacia trees,
they'll have this communications that 

3226
02:21:12,791 --> 02:21:12,791
there's nothing going on like that with 
mollusks.

3227
02:21:12,830 --> 02:21:17,830
They're like really stupid.
There was super ancient life forms that 

3228
02:21:17,830 --> 02:21:21,941
are kind of meat,
but they're almost like what we're 

3229
02:21:21,941 --> 02:21:24,461
talking about,
like that fucking gelatinous thing 

3230
02:21:24,461 --> 02:21:24,461
inside of the box.
That's what they're like.

3231
02:21:24,461 --> 02:21:25,430
You could eat it.
Yeah.

3232
02:21:25,431 --> 02:21:26,990
Scallops are amazing.
I mean,

3233
02:21:26,991 --> 02:21:29,840
I've had scallops.
They're amazing because they will.

3234
02:21:29,930 --> 02:21:30,580
Yes.
Oh,

3235
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:34,760
scalp is a mosque like clams and mussels
and mosque.

3236
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:36,740
Oh,
that's a genre expert.

3237
02:21:36,741 --> 02:21:38,300
Five minutes ago.
Can you remember the name of it?

3238
02:21:39,430 --> 02:21:41,540
I just forgot,
but scallops are amazing,

3239
02:21:41,541 --> 02:21:44,810
but those things are like a good way.
Oysters,

3240
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:47,750
they're a good way to get protein.
A lot of them is sustainable.

3241
02:21:47,751 --> 02:21:52,751
A lot of those things are sustainable 
because they actually make like farms 

3242
02:21:52,751 --> 02:21:56,141
have them.
They grow them on the ground the same 

3243
02:21:56,141 --> 02:21:56,141
way you would grow fruit.

3244
02:21:56,141 --> 02:21:56,141
They grow them on the ground of an ocean
obviously,

3245
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:59,570
but the same way you would grow fruit or
grow vegetables,

3246
02:21:59,571 --> 02:22:04,571
like you can grow these things and 
they're a good source of quote unquote 

3247
02:22:04,571 --> 02:22:07,640
animal protein in an ethical way.
Like these things are so primitive.

3248
02:22:07,670 --> 02:22:08,900
They have like they're,
they're,

3249
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:11,390
they're not feeling shit.
Like they're not getting bummed out that

3250
02:22:11,391 --> 02:22:13,690
you're eating right.
They just clamped down and closed.

3251
02:22:13,691 --> 02:22:15,880
They were like super duper high in 
protein.

3252
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:17,170
Yeah,
very high in protein.

3253
02:22:17,180 --> 02:22:19,850
Really good for you.
I'm oysters are a good way to,

3254
02:22:19,851 --> 02:22:24,851
especially oysters in olive oil.
It's a good way to stay in a fat based 

3255
02:22:24,851 --> 02:22:26,220
diet like Ketogenic Diet because there's
so much fat

3256
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:29,040
in them for the olive oil and then the 
oysters themselves.

3257
02:22:29,041 --> 02:22:30,300
Very,
very healthy for you.

3258
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:32,160
Yeah.
Really good for your body.

3259
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:34,950
I got sick from noise because I had too 
many at one time,

3260
02:22:34,951 --> 02:22:37,200
but there's a different,
different story.

3261
02:22:37,201 --> 02:22:38,640
You know,
raw oysters.

3262
02:22:38,641 --> 02:22:40,560
You really got to get fresh.
What are you talking about?

3263
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:42,190
Talking about cooked,
smoked oysters.

3264
02:22:42,191 --> 02:22:45,480
You getting like cans?
Like I take them with me on the road.

3265
02:22:45,780 --> 02:22:48,720
I'll tell you a buy them in bulk and 
I'll take them with me on the road.

3266
02:22:48,721 --> 02:22:50,760
So I have healthy snacks like in my 
hotel rooms.

3267
02:22:50,761 --> 02:22:54,300
And Oysters isn't bad for you?
No,

3268
02:22:55,230 --> 02:23:00,230
no.
I'm sure like there's some leaching of 

3269
02:23:00,230 --> 02:23:03,060
all sorts of different things.
When you put something into a container.

3270
02:23:03,061 --> 02:23:08,061
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't say she eat it every day 

3271
02:23:08,061 --> 02:23:08,061
because I used to eat sardines every 
day,

3272
02:23:08,061 --> 02:23:10,200
but I turned positive for arsenic.

3273
02:23:10,530 --> 02:23:14,430
They found traces of arsenic in my 
system and they were like deadly.

3274
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:19,790
It is,
but apparently it's just one of the 

3275
02:23:19,790 --> 02:23:21,360
heavy metals that is a at the bottom of 
the ocean that's affected by pollution.

3276
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:26,660
The levels of it are affected by 
pollution and so these sardines are 

3277
02:23:26,660 --> 02:23:29,140
particularly the kind of bottom feeders 
and if you're in a polluted area and you

3278
02:23:29,141 --> 02:23:32,280
get sardines from polluted area,
they'll have heavy metals in them,

3279
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:35,780
you know like mercury,
Mercury here that.

3280
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:39,930
So I got off the sardines for awhile and
went back and got tested.

3281
02:23:39,931 --> 02:23:41,220
It was a hundred percent clean.
They were like,

3282
02:23:41,230 --> 02:23:42,390
it's gotTa,
be the sardines.

3283
02:23:42,391 --> 02:23:43,410
I said,
totally makes sense.

3284
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:45,150
Can't eat them every day,
bro.

3285
02:23:45,210 --> 02:23:46,590
I was eating like three or four cans a 
day,

3286
02:23:46,980 --> 02:23:51,980
like three or four kids.
Anything is high in sodium.

3287
02:23:53,971 --> 02:23:55,380
Two sodiums.
Okay.

3288
02:23:55,560 --> 02:23:57,020
Just drink as long as you drink water.

3289
02:23:57,070 --> 02:23:59,240
Sodium was fine.
Like the idea that there's a,

3290
02:23:59,350 --> 02:24:04,350
a total misconception about sodium 
causing high blood pressure and heart 

3291
02:24:04,350 --> 02:24:09,261
attacks.
That was all based on a bullshit study 

3292
02:24:09,261 --> 02:24:09,261
at.
Somebody pushed through what?

3293
02:24:09,261 --> 02:24:14,210
What was that study like?
Sodium does not cause high blood 

3294
02:24:14,210 --> 02:24:17,781
pressure.
Go Google that because there was this 

3295
02:24:17,781 --> 02:24:20,151
whole bogus study that people keep 
repeating over and over again about 

3296
02:24:20,151 --> 02:24:24,471
salt.
Obviously you have too much of anything 

3297
02:24:24,471 --> 02:24:24,471
to kill you,
right?

3298
02:24:24,471 --> 02:24:24,471
Like we talked about,
water.

3299
02:24:24,471 --> 02:24:26,070
Water will fuck you up too much.
Salt will definitely kill you.

3300
02:24:26,130 --> 02:24:28,650
Too many star trek a pound of salt.
You're fucking dead,

3301
02:24:28,651 --> 02:24:30,000
man.
You're a dead man.

3302
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:33,150
You can eat a pound of meat.
It's time to end the war on salt.

3303
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:38,200
Zealous drive by politicians to limit 
our salt intake has little basis in 

3304
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:38,200
science.
Yeah,

3305
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:39,750
it's bullshit.
Not only that,

3306
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:42,480
it's an essential mineral like you need 
salt,

3307
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:43,110
salt.

3308
02:24:43,110 --> 02:24:45,660
Is it really important that you don't 
want to have too much of it?

3309
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:50,720
Absolutely.
That meaning like you don't want to 

3310
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:53,061
cover everything in Salt.
Just like you don't want to drink too 

3311
02:24:53,061 --> 02:24:53,061
much water,
just like you don't want to eat too much

3312
02:24:53,061 --> 02:24:54,420
fruit.
Like if you eat too many oranges,

3313
02:24:54,421 --> 02:24:56,510
it's not good.
You get 100 oranges is not good for you.

3314
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:57,780
It's horrible.
So much sugar.

3315
02:24:57,790 --> 02:24:58,740
So much sugar.
Yeah.

3316
02:24:59,070 --> 02:25:02,820
But to have a good healthy amount of 
salt in your diet,

3317
02:25:02,821 --> 02:25:07,821
especially like Himalayan salts,
really good minerals that shit's 

3318
02:25:07,821 --> 02:25:09,840
ancient.
These things are like Himalayan salt.

3319
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:12,600
That's salt crystal thing.
That lamp,

3320
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:14,080
that salt water.
If you ate that,

3321
02:25:14,081 --> 02:25:16,110
see that one over there and it's lit.
What if you ate that?

3322
02:25:16,530 --> 02:25:20,820
Probably super good.
Make Your Dick hard as a rock that um,

3323
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:24,260
that thing's supposed to like emit 
energy man.

3324
02:25:25,450 --> 02:25:27,750
Feels like it wasn't at.
It's over there.

3325
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:28,630
We,
you,

3326
02:25:28,810 --> 02:25:30,970
Jamie.
Remind me to replace the battery in that

3327
02:25:30,971 --> 02:25:33,420
one or whatever the fuck it needs.
It doesn't need a new bowl.

3328
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:36,120
Just duck.
Duck like Oh fuck.

3329
02:25:36,140 --> 02:25:37,420
We're at burn me.
Yeah.

3330
02:25:37,421 --> 02:25:38,690
Don't fuck with it.
Did it shouldn't?

3331
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:39,730
No.
Dude.

3332
02:25:41,050 --> 02:25:42,520
Is it plugged in?
Plugged in anymore?

3333
02:25:42,610 --> 02:25:44,610
I think I unplugged it.
I hope you wrote off.

3334
02:25:45,050 --> 02:25:48,580
It doesn't work and just keep it plugged
in while it's just in there cooking.

3335
02:25:48,610 --> 02:25:53,430
I cut back on smoking.
Yeah,

3336
02:25:53,610 --> 02:25:56,560
I've been good with my diet.
I'm like really fascinated by it.

3337
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:59,710
So you got somebody doing this for you.
You talking to a nutritionist?

3338
02:26:00,790 --> 02:26:05,790
Eating Shit and just going by he makes 
sure that you you get what you really 

3339
02:26:06,581 --> 02:26:11,581
should do really should do and I can 
send you to a guy is go to a real good 

3340
02:26:11,581 --> 02:26:16,111
doctor that specializes in nutritional 
profiles and get your blood work done 

3341
02:26:16,111 --> 02:26:20,250
and let them find out like,
do you need maybe you need nice and you 

3342
02:26:20,250 --> 02:26:22,931
need vitamin D,
need vitamin B like here you are low in 

3343
02:26:22,931 --> 02:26:25,831
this or you're low in that.
There's a lot of stuff that people 

3344
02:26:25,831 --> 02:26:25,831
neglect in there and didn't even know.
You know,

3345
02:26:25,831 --> 02:26:27,670
you don't know until you actually get 
your blood work done.

3346
02:26:27,910 --> 02:26:29,010
You don't know what's low.
What's.

3347
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:34,400
I do want to do that.
I mean I'd take a lot of vitamins and 

3348
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:34,400
stuff and I asked her.
I think I,

3349
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:37,900
I kind of like,
I'm doing a decent job just going rogue.

3350
02:26:37,930 --> 02:26:41,380
That was my last tattoo by the way.
How drunk were you when you.

3351
02:26:41,830 --> 02:26:45,150
I was actually pretty deezer.
I got him.

3352
02:26:45,210 --> 02:26:50,210
I got to Vegas.
Why did you decide to write rogue and 

3353
02:26:50,210 --> 02:26:53,281
your arm and was me and my buddies and 
we'd go like one more like partying and 

3354
02:26:53,281 --> 02:26:54,130
like my buddy will text me like,
hey,

3355
02:26:54,140 --> 02:26:55,180
you want to go to the gym?
And I'm like,

3356
02:26:55,181 --> 02:26:59,610
I'm going fucking rogue.
Then that just means that it's gonna I'm

3357
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:02,350
signing up for your vendor.

3358
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:04,070
Good partier though,
Dude.

3359
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:09,160
Oh,
tell you I've run into you going rogue 

3360
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:09,160
many times and it's never been anything 
but hugs and laughs.

3361
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:10,190
Oh yeah.
No,

3362
02:27:10,191 --> 02:27:15,191
I'm like a really good drunk,
like I know how to do it and I know I'm 

3363
02:27:15,191 --> 02:27:17,540
not like people like see me.
Like I post photos and shit.

3364
02:27:17,541 --> 02:27:18,350
I'm always,
you know,

3365
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:23,590
out like raging and I'm not always 
raging but when I do it's really 

3366
02:27:23,590 --> 02:27:26,270
controlled.
It's not like you're good at it.

3367
02:27:26,330 --> 02:27:31,330
I've,
I've built up a tolerance of an I know 

3368
02:27:31,330 --> 02:27:34,031
what I'm doing.
Like I don't just do any shot that's 

3369
02:27:34,031 --> 02:27:34,310
handed to me and just like I,
I dunno,

3370
02:27:34,330 --> 02:27:36,320
I,
I keep it very simple.

3371
02:27:36,321 --> 02:27:38,420
But yeah,
I get really fired up.

3372
02:27:38,480 --> 02:27:40,490
I just,
I love drinking and going out.

3373
02:27:40,910 --> 02:27:43,490
Yeah.
I've never like fighter guy or I'm never

3374
02:27:43,491 --> 02:27:46,940
like Moody Dark Guy.
That's the worst.

3375
02:27:46,941 --> 02:27:49,700
The depressed cry guy.
So Jesus,

3376
02:27:49,701 --> 02:27:52,940
will you stop.
Why are you crying all over?

3377
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:57,710
He broke up.
It happens.

3378
02:27:58,040 --> 02:27:59,390
Yeah.
So for you.

3379
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:05,080
Yeah.
I'll never quit drinking drinking's to 

3380
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:05,080
fun though.
Thank you.

3381
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:05,480
Know it said that I.
Yeah,

3382
02:28:05,481 --> 02:28:06,770
I don't.
I mean I'll take break.

3383
02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:10,550
I liked drinking.
It's fun.

3384
02:28:11,030 --> 02:28:13,310
I don't like the effects of it on the 
body,

3385
02:28:13,850 --> 02:28:14,900
but it's,
that's the,

3386
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:20,080
that's the fucking tradeoff.
The tradeoff is it's fun for a little 

3387
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:20,630
while and then you're like,
oh,

3388
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:22,730
was in Italy?
I drink wine every night.

3389
02:28:23,090 --> 02:28:24,260
I was in Italy.
I just got back.

3390
02:28:24,290 --> 02:28:28,360
I drank wine seven nights in a row.
Uh,

3391
02:28:28,370 --> 02:28:32,540
drank many glasses of wine.
I passed a seven nights in a row.

3392
02:28:32,830 --> 02:28:34,620
I totally went off the rails with my 
diet.

3393
02:28:34,621 --> 02:28:36,590
I gained five pounds of to.
It's Italy.

3394
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:37,820
That's what I'm saying,
Dawg.

3395
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:40,220
Shit,
yeah.

3396
02:28:40,221 --> 02:28:42,170
You got to go off the rails and enjoy 
yourself.

3397
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:47,560
But it's fun to go off the rails and get
back on the rails and you appreciate 

3398
02:28:47,560 --> 02:28:49,010
being on the rails unlike the way you 
think.

3399
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:51,020
Yeah.
But you're like,

3400
02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:53,690
you're not a drunk that I'd ever avoid.
If I see this.

3401
02:28:53,690 --> 02:28:54,950
Certain people,
we all know them.

3402
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:57,160
You see them drunk and you're like,
oh no,

3403
02:28:57,860 --> 02:28:59,720
I can't be responsible for this.
I gotta get Outta here.

3404
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:00,490
Yeah.
No,

3405
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:02,930
it's scary.
There's some comics where I'm like,

3406
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:05,000
Ooh,
I gotTa Babysit,

3407
02:29:05,630 --> 02:29:10,630
Babysit this person.
There's some dark motherfuckers 

3408
02:29:11,340 --> 02:29:12,660
completion.
So that to me,

3409
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:13,220
broom,
like,

3410
02:29:13,250 --> 02:29:14,780
oh my God,
I can't do this.

3411
02:29:15,350 --> 02:29:16,760
Can't do this.
I can't read your texts.

3412
02:29:16,761 --> 02:29:19,280
I can't help you with this.
This is yours.

3413
02:29:19,330 --> 02:29:20,780
Yeah.
People go bad.

3414
02:29:20,781 --> 02:29:23,030
Rogue Scott.
My kids,

3415
02:29:23,031 --> 02:29:23,600
Bro.
Okay.

3416
02:29:24,550 --> 02:29:25,770
Okay.
I got it.

3417
02:29:25,780 --> 02:29:26,600
Hey,
look at the time.

3418
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:32,200
You're not thinking rational.
You're drunk.

3419
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:35,330
Party didn't do a family.
Meanwhile in the middle of it,

3420
02:29:35,331 --> 02:29:40,331
like he's gone through tinder,
swiping the fucking worst.

3421
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:46,130
I lost one of my best friends who is 
like one of my road fucking buddies.

3422
02:29:46,700 --> 02:29:47,560
And He,
uh,

3423
02:29:48,170 --> 02:29:53,170
my roommate was friends with his ex 
girlfriend and they were watching a 

3424
02:29:53,170 --> 02:29:55,910
movie and I came home and I went to bed 
and said hi to him.

3425
02:29:55,910 --> 02:30:00,660
And then the next day he like flipped 
out on me and I texted him.

3426
02:30:00,661 --> 02:30:01,280
I go,
what's up man?

3427
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:03,310
He's like,
my ex girlfriend was at air,

3428
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:04,340
fucking house.
I go,

3429
02:30:04,341 --> 02:30:06,200
yeah,
it was watch a movie with my buddy.

3430
02:30:06,201 --> 02:30:07,610
And he's like,
what the fuck man?

3431
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:11,390
It's like he didn't tell me fuck you.
And then I never talked to me again.

3432
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:16,400
So you were supposed to tell him that 
his ex girlfriend is dating your buddy?

3433
02:30:16,580 --> 02:30:17,380
Yeah.
It's like,

3434
02:30:17,430 --> 02:30:20,470
well it was so bizarre and he's one of 
my best friends and he won't talk to me.

3435
02:30:20,740 --> 02:30:22,580
That you wouldn't,
didn't tell him about it.

3436
02:30:22,610 --> 02:30:27,610
Yeah.
And it's been a year and he won't talk 

3437
02:30:27,610 --> 02:30:27,610
to me anymore.
Whoa.

3438
02:30:27,610 --> 02:30:29,900
Now does he,
did he want you to stop it in some way?

3439
02:30:29,930 --> 02:30:31,400
I don't know.
I never found out.

3440
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:35,260
That doesn't make any sense.
So I could understand like if you want,

3441
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:38,000
if you told him he would just get bummed
out.

3442
02:30:38,060 --> 02:30:39,230
Right.
Well that's the thing.

3443
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:41,050
They were just watching a movie.
It wasn't like a,

3444
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:43,010
but they weren't dating.
It was just really weird.

3445
02:30:43,011 --> 02:30:48,011
Anyway,
my point being is that while you around 

3446
02:30:48,011 --> 02:30:48,110
soon as you got out of the room,
it was a love song,

3447
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:54,800
but it's like it's like bad road friend 
that just gets fucking needs this,

3448
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:55,460
you know,
I,

3449
02:30:55,500 --> 02:30:57,560
I just can't deal with drama.
Like when I go out,

3450
02:30:57,561 --> 02:31:02,561
I don't want drama and nobody does.
I think what we're talking about 

3451
02:31:02,561 --> 02:31:05,120
earlier,
how chimps have this horrific behavior.

3452
02:31:05,150 --> 02:31:07,400
I think there's some of that leftover 
and people,

3453
02:31:07,401 --> 02:31:11,720
and I think it comes out when you get 
involved in relationships and breakups.

3454
02:31:12,110 --> 02:31:15,080
I think you see that angry chimp come 
out sometimes.

3455
02:31:15,650 --> 02:31:17,870
Oh yeah.
Alcohol is one of those things.

3456
02:31:17,871 --> 02:31:20,040
Obviously it affects not just even

3457
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:21,870
alcohol,
so jealousy too though.

3458
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:23,510
Just jealousy as well.
Yeah,

3459
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:26,090
but also,
but jealousy fueled with alcohol,

3460
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:31,100
which is a disaster.
I mean you look at the people that are 

3461
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:34,071
in jail right now because they got drunk
and got jealous and pulled out a gun or 

3462
02:31:34,071 --> 02:31:35,280
pulled out a baseball bat and just went

3463
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:37,710
and then add coke to that and you get 
confident,

3464
02:31:39,550 --> 02:31:41,280
confident,
crazed,

3465
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:46,820
righteous.
I'll show her like you live in in some 

3466
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:49,401
stupid two dimensional movie,
like you don't even thinking about the 

3467
02:31:49,401 --> 02:31:49,401
consequences.

3468
02:31:49,401 --> 02:31:50,340
Can't even cocaine.
I can't even.

3469
02:31:50,740 --> 02:31:52,560
I can't even do it.
I never got really into it.

3470
02:31:52,561 --> 02:31:53,430
I mean,
I definitely did it,

3471
02:31:53,431 --> 02:31:56,370
but I was never one of those guys that 
was just.

3472
02:31:56,371 --> 02:32:01,371
I mean I have friends still that go hard
in the paint with that and they're like 

3473
02:32:01,371 --> 02:32:04,380
creeping into their forties and they're 
still every weekend.

3474
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:07,590
Dunkin has a great bit on adderall that 
I wish I had adderall and cocaine that I

3475
02:32:07,591 --> 02:32:10,650
wish I could share with the audience.
You'll have to go see him.

3476
02:32:10,740 --> 02:32:13,040
Duncan trussell live in New York City.
Love you don.

3477
02:32:13,380 --> 02:32:14,760
During the last end up,
he moved.

3478
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:17,160
He's happy there.
I'm really upset because he liked it.

3479
02:32:17,161 --> 02:32:18,900
I was hoping he hated it.
He's living in Brooklyn.

3480
02:32:18,901 --> 02:32:22,050
He's like the king of Brooklyn.
I can see him like in Brooklyn.

3481
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:23,640
They took him in and they gave him fresh
hats.

3482
02:32:23,890 --> 02:32:25,060
He's like,
hey guys.

3483
02:32:25,061 --> 02:32:27,180
Hey guys.
You're sweet e's.

3484
02:32:30,370 --> 02:32:32,980
He did a recent podcast,
folks with Aubrey.

3485
02:32:33,010 --> 02:32:34,240
Aubrey Marcus.
It's amazing.

3486
02:32:34,241 --> 02:32:36,160
It's really good.
His live podcasts are incredible,

3487
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:38,830
really good.
He's got a fucking cult.

3488
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:41,160
Duncan's essentially running a colt.
He's.

3489
02:32:41,530 --> 02:32:43,930
He would be the best caught later.
He has a house.

3490
02:32:43,931 --> 02:32:48,931
Omer.
Here's a guy who was like the House Ohm 

3491
02:32:48,931 --> 02:32:48,931
guy.
Now the guy did ohm and did.

3492
02:32:48,931 --> 02:32:48,931
Oh,
I'm so good.

3493
02:32:48,931 --> 02:32:52,630
And his name was like fucking bobby.
Something like shallow Monga,

3494
02:32:52,870 --> 02:32:57,870
some fucking ancient ingesting Swami 
Swami rick or something like that and 

3495
02:32:57,870 --> 02:33:01,150
this guy does an ome in front of his 
live audience and it was so good.

3496
02:33:01,410 --> 02:33:02,400
Will you be the household?

3497
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:05,210
Really?
Yeah.

3498
02:33:05,211 --> 02:33:07,190
That guy's a house home guy.
Every time.

3499
02:33:07,191 --> 02:33:09,040
Dunkin doesn't show that.
Guys going to do owns for them.

3500
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:13,820
Oh good Lord.
He has a chance that he does.

3501
02:33:13,821 --> 02:33:14,180
We,
we,

3502
02:33:14,330 --> 02:33:17,480
we've done it before.
Like in audiences.

3503
02:33:17,481 --> 02:33:19,790
We started off a show with it once.
It didn't work.

3504
02:33:19,791 --> 02:33:21,440
It was a disaster.
It was a terrible idea.

3505
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:26,750
We started off a show where we all got 
on stage and had the audience ohm and 

3506
02:33:26,750 --> 02:33:26,930
then Duncan went,
did stand up,

3507
02:33:26,931 --> 02:33:29,030
but there were so weirded out by the 
time they were like,

3508
02:33:29,031 --> 02:33:32,780
what the fuck are you guys doing?
So we did it a couple of times,

3509
02:33:32,810 --> 02:33:34,790
we did a couple of times to like breath 
blessed the show.

3510
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:41,420
I remember when I had my twitch channel 
to Duncan does a twitch stream every so 

3511
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:45,831
often and what is he doing here?
He is a Watt James Corden dancing in 

3512
02:33:45,831 --> 02:33:50,391
some way,
but he had a mask on and was holding a 

3513
02:33:50,391 --> 02:33:50,550
thing.
Of course it's pretty fun to watch.

3514
02:33:50,610 --> 02:33:51,450
Yeah,
he's out of his mind.

3515
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:54,420
Don't get and wrote on my vagina mask is
that a vagina?

3516
02:33:54,510 --> 02:33:56,210
Looks like a vagina,
vagina,

3517
02:33:56,470 --> 02:33:57,240
vagina,
mask.

3518
02:33:57,300 --> 02:33:59,310
I had my show on comedy central,
pretend time,

3519
02:33:59,311 --> 02:34:01,560
a sketch show and it was like really 
aggressive and weird.

3520
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:02,760
So I was like,
Oh Duncan,

3521
02:34:02,761 --> 02:34:05,180
you got to write on it.
So I brought Dunkin onto right.

3522
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:08,280
And every sketch he would hand in,
I was always like,

3523
02:34:08,300 --> 02:34:10,020
all right,
what the fuck is this going to be?

3524
02:34:10,230 --> 02:34:13,520
And it was so insane.

3525
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:19,040
Yeah.
Like you're playing like a pussy and 

3526
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:19,040
makes shit that

3527
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:23,250
like elves and like the I can juggle 
knives and then they like each other's 

3528
02:34:24,110 --> 02:34:24,890
ass.
That was

3529
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:29,900
a psycho.
I would have to like just every sketch 

3530
02:34:29,901 --> 02:34:34,901
or try to find what is arable out of it,
but I mean there were like obviously 

3531
02:34:35,661 --> 02:34:37,970
moments of brilliance,
but were sometimes I was like,

3532
02:34:38,030 --> 02:34:40,130
dude,
what the fuck is this?

3533
02:34:40,160 --> 02:34:45,160
What in the fuck indeed.
Nick Swardson don't change your 

3534
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:46,160
beautiful.
Thank you.

3535
02:34:46,770 --> 02:34:48,110
And you play a good game of pool,
sir.

3536
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:50,860
I'm in your shows.
Still available.

3537
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:53,600
People could see that.
Typical Rick,

3538
02:34:53,601 --> 02:34:56,770
me and dirt nasty.
It's the guy who directed grandma's boy.

3539
02:34:57,140 --> 02:35:02,140
You're at the comedy store all the time.
You're touring all the time.

3540
02:35:02,330 --> 02:35:06,900
Getting ready for my new next netflix 
special coming out shit and doing that.

3541
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:09,170
I don't know yet.
I might be.

3542
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:14,380
I was going to be next spring,
but it might be sooner because the sets 

3543
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:15,320
are coming together,
but yeah,

3544
02:35:15,410 --> 02:35:17,810
all my dates are posted on Rio.
Nick Swardson,

3545
02:35:17,811 --> 02:35:20,910
instagram and twitter and website.

3546
02:35:20,990 --> 02:35:22,670
You have a website or you just don't do 
that anymore?

3547
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:24,170
The websites coming up.
I just.

3548
02:35:24,350 --> 02:35:26,270
We're developing it right now so it'll 
be up soon,

3549
02:35:26,330 --> 02:35:31,330
but I'll post on my social media and 
then I got a bunch of dates up until 

3550
02:35:31,330 --> 02:35:31,820
Christmas,
so.

3551
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:33,030
Awesome.
Yeah.

3552
02:35:33,230 --> 02:35:35,480
Well if you haven't seen nick lives.
Fucking hilarious.

3553
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:37,160
Thanks dude,
and this was a lot of fun,

3554
02:35:37,161 --> 02:35:37,790
man.
Yeah,

3555
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:39,920
me like six years.
I now.

3556
02:35:39,921 --> 02:35:41,750
It's fucking nuts.
We see each other all the time.

3557
02:35:41,751 --> 02:35:43,700
We did this.
We did a podcast six years ago,

3558
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:46,610
but we did it more often.
We'll do more often.

3559
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:49,370
I'm going to do the laser blast 
campaign,

3560
02:35:49,410 --> 02:35:51,620
I'm sure down for that.
That's going to happen,

3561
02:35:51,621 --> 02:35:54,080
so we'll do that as soon as we set up 
the new studio,

3562
02:35:54,110 --> 02:35:55,640
which should be within the next month or
so.

3563
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:57,140
All right,
thanks everybody.

3564
02:35:57,920 --> 02:36:01,190
Dorian Yates for multiple time.
Mr Olympia,

3565
02:36:01,510 --> 02:36:04,160
mother dot.
