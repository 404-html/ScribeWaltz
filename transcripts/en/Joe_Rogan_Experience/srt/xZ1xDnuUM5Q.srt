You do not need to return the product.

60
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:33,980
All you have to do is say
that this stuff sucks.

61
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,450
That's how confident we are in it.

That you got to like it and
you got to keep ordering it.

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,560
It's a staple in my diet.

64
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,760
I take that shit every day.

65

meeting cause Rick Ross is here and we're

67
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:46,131
This is going to be interesting.

68
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:46,701
Ladies and gentlemen.

69
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:47,540

73
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:52,100
Yeah.

74
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,310
Well.

75
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,580
Good experience

76
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,650

Joe Rogan podcast all day.

78
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,363
Ladies,

79
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,413
Ladies and gentlemen,

80
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,100
we're going into the rabbit hole today.

81
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,110
This is going to be an interesting one.

82
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,420
This is going to be a
weird one we have here.

83
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,490
Former aspiring tennis star.

84
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,460
Is that true?

85
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:14,980
Really true.

86
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,810
You were aspiring tennis
star was a tennis star.

87
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,663
Yeah.

88
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,663
This is a,

89
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,520
a man who eventually went on to become
probably the most famous drug dealer in

90
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,720
the history of Los Angeles.

91
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:27,760
I would say that's as
accurate as you can get.

92
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,300
Yeah.

93
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,690
Yeah.

94
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,410
You're the most,

95
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:29,651
I mean,

96
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,390
you're not the United States
if not the United States.

97
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,910
It's right up there though.

98
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:34,990
The most famous,

99
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,981
the most famous.

100
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:36,400
Yeah.

101
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,020
You got a dude stole your fucking name.

102
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,351
No,

103
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:38,501
no,

104
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:38,651
no.

105
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:40,390
Like three people stole my name.

106
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,350
Sure.

107
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,183
Three people.

108
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,910
Three people,

109
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,910
three rappers or three a
different drug dealers wrappers.

110
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,180
Uh,

111
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,223
let me see.

112
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,360
We know the guy who was probably the
most famous out of all of them is William

113
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,650
Roberts who goes by Rick Ross.

114
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,510
Uh,

115
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,040
do we use the wrapper
that it is a corrections

116
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,570
officer?

117
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,291
Correctional officers.

118
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,370
How hilarious is that?

119
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:02,850
Anything?

120
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,370
He's the best gangsta
rapper ever embedded in.

121
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,373
And biggie.

122
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,320
That's nonsense.

123
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,180
And then we got my man who's cool,

124
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,043
who I'm cool with,

125
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,411
you know,

126
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:11,940
and I don't mind him using parts of,

127
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,380
my name is freeway out of
Philly and we also have a,

128
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,020
it was a freeway rich out of Kansas City
that did pretty good in the Midwest.

129
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,280
Um,

130
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,740
there are also some guys right now out
of a Ohio who go buy it and then with the

131
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:25,574
freeway boys.

132
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,590
So that's four different,

133
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,250
uh,

134
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,780
groups that have taken my name in on my,

135
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,091
you know,

136
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:34,950
parts of my persona and use it.

137
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,740
Well,

138
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,660
one of them got very famous though,

139
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,130
very famous right now.

140
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,640
Yeah,

141
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,690
that's fascinating.

142
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,360
And you know what's really weird,

143
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,430
it's kind of weird too,

144
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:45,840
you know that to show him,

145
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,280
write his name and identity and in
claiming as your own in their background.

146
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,480
Well,

147
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,181
what's Hilarious,

148
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:51,511
I'm going to,

149
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:54,600
I'm going to send Brian a link
of where he talked about it.

150
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,170
He had,

151
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,891
he'd come on us,

152
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:57,360
dude show and uh,

153
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,490
the guy asked him about it and uh,

154
00:03:59,520 --> 00:03:59,851
his,

155
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:02,340
his reasoning response was so stupid.

156
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,070
It is,

157
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,890
it's amazing the guy is successful is as
successful as he is because he was like

158
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,300
you.

159
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,471
No,

160
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:08,581
no,

161
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:08,671
no,

162
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:08,821
no.

163
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:10,500
That happened like 10 years ago.

164
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,490
I got that nickname.

165
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:12,510
I wasn't even about that.

166
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:14,600
Like the fuck can I answer is that it's,

167
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,770
it doesn't even mean when you know,

168
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,240
you know that the dude exists,

169
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:18,690
you know?

170
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,523
I know.

171
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:19,861
Okay.

172
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:21,750
I'm a white standup comedian.

173
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,120
I know who freeway Ricky Ross is.

174
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,620
You don't know.

175
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,660
And you're a fucking corrections officer
who became a rapper and you're in that

176
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:33,750
world and you don't know who Rick Ross
is and you just happen to have his

177
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:34,650
fucking name.

178
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,181
Well,

179
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:35,391
you know,

180
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:35,750
the guy,

181
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,410
the guy,

182
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:36,831
one thing,

183
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:38,060
I got to get a guy and he's,

184
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:38,811
he's powerful.

185
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,150
He didn't put some moves together.

186
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,450
Now that he's getting courts and
everybody to do what he wants them to do.

187
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,530
So whatever he's doing,

188
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,640
he's damn good at it.

189
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,330
I mean,

190
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:47,601
you know,

191
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:52,601
to have the judge to rule in his
favor the other day was like really,

192
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:53,750
really ironic to me.

193
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,420
I could not believe that
somebody could say that.

194
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,830
If somebody steals something from you,

195
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,510
no matter how long it is,

196
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,390
that it takes you before
you catch them and can,

197
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,283
can bring them,

198
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,590
uh,

199
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,920
to the jurisdictions,

200
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,833
uh,

201
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,923
attention.

202
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,810
How could they say that the
statute of limitations had ran out?

203
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,280
That was just so crazy to me.

204
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,920
How do you have a statute of
limitations are in your name?

205
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,450
And that's what I was saying.

206
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:17,721
I mean,

207
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,310
if somebody steals something from you,

208
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,383
I mean,

209
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,240
it takes you 10 years to catch him
with it and you catch them with it.

210
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,320
It has all the,

211
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,060
all the makings on it that it's yours.

212
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,790
How could you not be made to give it back?

213
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,141
You know what I'm saying?

214
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:30,501
And you saying,

215
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:30,621
oh,

216
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,760
well he had his 10 years,

217
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:32,331
so now it's,

218
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:32,830
he is,

219
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,011
well,

220
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,140
what's really crazy is
that it's in the mode.

221
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,590
I mean,

222
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,590
wrap the world of rap is supposed to
be the most legitimate world ever.

223
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,300
Like you can't get
caught with any bullshit.

224
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,520
You can't get caught faking anything.

225
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,870
Do you get caught faking anything?

226
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:49,360
People will turn on you like that.

227
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,530
I'm used to be like that

228
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,603
minimum lyric.

229
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,120
Yeah.

230
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,090
He bit somebody robbing
my lyric and you are done.

231
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:55,871
You know?

232
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:58,130
Remember Nelly Benelli I mean those guys

233
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,170
last night [inaudible] Nelly,

234
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,693
Nelly Minelli.

235
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,230
Yeah,

236
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,481
yeah.

237
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,310
Well those guys were
really rappers though,

238
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,671
you know,

239
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,740
but I mean still doing the time of,

240
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,061
of,

241
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:07,490
of,

242
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,271
of genuine,

243
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,104
real yes.

244
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,430
And now I think that that the time has
changed so much and it's not about real

245
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,090
anymore.

246
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,990
It's about,

247
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,293
uh,

248
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,600
faking it,

249
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,080
you know?

250
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,231
Well,

251
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:18,351
it's,

252
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:23,351
once someone gets popular enough that
they bypass the underground hardcore fans

253
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,340
and they make it into the mainstream and
then they become a part of pop culture

254
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:28,880
like this,

255
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,880
every [inaudible] that just got into the
mainstream culture because the words in

256
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,800
between that they're not good.

257
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,130
No,

258
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,401
it's not.

259
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,450
He's not a good rapper.

260
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,540
It's that every day I'm
hustling is just so good.

261
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:41,991
You know,

262
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:43,370
when you hear that in a club you like,

263
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:43,731
damn,

264
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:44,564
that's good.

265
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:44,961
You know,

266
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,180
it's just such a good
hook that that made him,

267
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,480
I mean,

268
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,800
that's where it all took off from.

269
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,461
Exactly.

270
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,211
And you don't,

271
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,950
and you have universal behind you pushing,

272
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,761
you know,

273
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:55,700
they started pushing stuff
down our kids' throat,

274
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:56,091
you know,

275
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:57,170
and next thing you know,

276
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:58,004
they'd taken it.

277
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,510
That's fascinating.

278
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:00,800
So he's got your name now.

279
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,510
So now it's legal that he's got your name.

280
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,420
Well,

281
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,850
why didn't he use his own fucking name?

282
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,290
What Rick Ross,

283
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,670
is it just a name?

284
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:08,301
You know what I mean?

285
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,670
It's not like star child beyond the grave.

286
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:11,151
You know what I mean?

287
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,040
You don't have like
some crazy fucking name.

288
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,323
You know what I mean?

289
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,351
What's his name?

290
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,184
His real name?

291
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:16,640
Uh,

292
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,660
William Roberts.

293
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,700
What's wrong with Bill Roberts?

294
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,650
I don't know.

295
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,590
How about Bill Roberts?

296
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,760
I'm ready to wrap Rick Ross.

297
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,061
I mean,

298
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:24,670
if it was raw,

299
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,210
sounds like you guys
tells you real estate,

300
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,040
you can be like on one of those,

301
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,281
uh,

302
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,290
those billboards that they
have on the bus stops.

303
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:30,591
You know,

304
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,210
Rick Ross [inaudible] face.

305
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,010
If my mom would have
named me William Roberts,

306
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:34,940
my name would be William.

307
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:35,330
Robert.

308
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,621
Yeah.

309
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:35,901
Yeah,

310
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,760
you'd be fruit freeway will Robert.

311
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,623
Exactly.

312
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,860
What's wrong with that?

313
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:42,410
Well,

314
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:42,681
you know,

315
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:42,951
hey man,

316
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:43,970
we can't hear you in the background.

317
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:44,810
There's no microphone.

318
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,230
Even,

319
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:45,950
even that,

320
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,783
uh,

321
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,970
everyday I'm hustling
is something that I had,

322
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,040
I used to say he got that out of a book
that Gary Rep Worldcon dark alliance and

323
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:54,861
you know,

324
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:57,020
I was telling Gary then
I'm hustling everyday.

325
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,900
So he took that into a song.

326
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,370
So I mean,

327
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,671
you know,

328
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,020
I don't know what it is with this guy.

329
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:03,291
You know,

330
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,760
he tattooed my name on his hand.

331
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,510
That's so strange.

332
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:07,761
I mean,

333
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:08,420
I'm going to do,

334
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,670
that's so strange.

335
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:10,504
It's a little weird.

336
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,620
And he used to be a corrections officer,

337
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:15,410
which is really fucked up because
to become a corrections officer,

338
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,910
they going to do a
background check on you.

339
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,580
Oh Man,

340
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,680
I make sure you're not a felon.

341
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,543
Wiki clean.

342
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,061
Yeah.

343
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:20,570
You can't,

344
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,310
you can't be this gangster dude and
be a fucking guy who was a corrections

345
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,144
officer.

346
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,660
We should get his application and read
what it says and what it takes to be a

347
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,680
correctional officer.

348
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,641
All the,

349
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,030
uh,

350
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,810
criteria.

351
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,620
Yeah.

352
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,600
How about the pictures of
him with the outfit on?

353
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,483
You see,

354
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,150
I saw it.

355
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,000
It's ridiculous.

356
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,380
I started with the smooth face.

357
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,020
What's really fucked up
is there's a video of him,

358
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:42,621
uh,

359
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,140
an old video of him and
you're on the video,

360
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,670
you're on the beginning of it.

361
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:49,610
And then he comes out like he
knew who the fuck you were.

362
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,140
He put you in his video,

363
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,800
right?

364
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:51,981
Yeah.

365
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,740
But he said he didn't know
who I was under oath the too.

366
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,560
How do you not bring that video
and just stick that in his face.

367
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,610
And it should be case quote.

368
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,900
What a judge didn't want to see that.

369
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,383
Whoa.

370
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,710
So this is the judges getting bribed.

371
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,460
Must be,

372
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:05,791
I mean,

373
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,230
you know,

374
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,063
has to be,

375
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,400
it looks funny to me.

376
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:08,970
How can he,

377
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,540
how could you,

378
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,870
it has to be bribery 100% that
that judge should be in jail.

379
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,381
There's no,

380
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:14,300
there's no doubt about it.

381
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,420
That's your fucking name,

382
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:15,630
man.

383
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,440
That's your fucking name.

384
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,920
I mean,

385
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,820
and let this guy come in court and say
that he never heard any of her hurting

386
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:21,420
me.

387
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,253
That's hilarious.

388
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,910
And how he invented the name,

389
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:24,271
you know,

390
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:24,780
it was like,

391
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,613
wow.

392
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:25,981
You know,

393
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,880
he gave us some elaborate story to,

394
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,460
well hell,

395
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,191
you've rented what?

396
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:30,210
I heard him on this video.

397
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,170
It was so stupid.

398
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:31,621
He was like,

399
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:31,831
no,

400
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:32,581
the name came bro.

401
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:33,750
Look 10 years ago.

402
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,763
Like what does that mean?

403
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,113
What does that mean?

404
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,150
It was like a non answer to
the question and it was just,

405
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,610
and then he tried to like beat passed it.

406
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,571
The question,

407
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:45,960
just talk about people just like to talk
a lot of shit and start a lot of shit.

408
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:46,261
And I'm like,

409
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:46,800
what?

410
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:46,951
Yeah,

411
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:47,790
he likes the Bolo.

412
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,511
He liked the bolo.

413
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:49,344
People

414
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,600
come in and you know like either
you're going to do the interview to,

415
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:53,710
you ain't gonna to do the interview.

416
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:54,850
I ain't gonna talk about this.

417
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:55,181
You know,

418
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:56,740
I'm going to talk about
what I want to talk about.

419
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,111
Oh,

420
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:57,531
I see.

421
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:00,260
So he doesn't just come in and
just have a conversation with you.

422
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:02,780
He comes into like with
a specific set of rules.

423
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,591
Exactly.

424
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:03,960
Yeah.

425
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,810
I think most of his interviews
or rehearsed and written down,

426
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,171
you know,

427
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,004
the way,

428
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,241
I mean,

429
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,350
the way they seem like to me,

430
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:10,800
you know,

431
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
I mean everything about this guy,

432
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:12,590
you know,

433
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,760
it's,

434
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,980
it's a suspect.

435
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:14,221
You know,

436
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:14,941
when I was in jail,

437
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:16,190
somebody wrote me a letter and said,

438
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,321
hey,

439
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:17,250
his beard is fake.

440
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,660
Okay.

441
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,770
Could you imagine this chick
black cotton balls on his face?

442
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:25,941
Yeah.

443
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:26,960
This chick wrote me and said,

444
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,111
oh,

445
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:28,300
his beard is fake too.

446
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,511
I mean,

447
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:29,781
you know,

448
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:30,980
it's just so much stuff and you know,

449
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:32,030
you hear and people,

450
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:32,600
you know,

451
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,320
shooting your messages and in,

452
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,960
in all kinds of stuff like that there.

453
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:36,580
Man.

454
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,640
A matter of fact,

455
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:42,620
a couple of weeks ago I get a call and
it was a guy that was in jail while he

456
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:43,790
was a correctional officer.

457
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,091
You said,

458
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:44,924
here's the story.

459
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,630
She hit a story.

460
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,463
This guy,

461
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,410
well,

462
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,020
they have to say,

463
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,853
what is her?

464
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,371
Oh Man.

465
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:53,510
He said this guy was one of the
worst CEO's that you could be.

466
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:53,721
You know,

467
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,600
he was one that CLC
already doesn't have power.

468
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,480
He has to go to his boss
and tell his boss on you.

469
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,020
So he said that this guy was running
around and all sneaky and trying to hit

470
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:04,010
what they talking about.

471
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,280
And if they shoot dice and he'd run
up and tell his boss ain't down there

472
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:08,200
shooting dice boss,

473
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,373
let's go.

474
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,251
Yeah,

475
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:10,551
yeah,

476
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:10,851
yeah.

477
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:12,190
That's the kind of guy they use using for.

478
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,930
And then like when they do rates,

479
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,740
you know when they Rachel sale,

480
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,420
he would be the first one they push in.

481
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:17,751
You know,

482
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:18,140
the big,

483
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,160
the big fat guy.

484
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,491
You know,

485
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,470
cause everybody be kind of
scared of the big fat guy.

486
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,290
So they would all get behind him
and shoved him up in the sale.

487
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,950
So all this big blob of meters.

488
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,400
So he was the battering Ram.

489
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,263
Yay.

490
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,920
Oh that's hilarious.

491
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,783
Wow.

492
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,080
It's so fucked up.

493
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:41,220
Did that guy got legitimate that all
of a sudden he's a legit rap star man.

494
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,150
It's fascinating.

495
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,280
It's fascinating how that snuck by,

496
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,143
you know?

497
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,641
Well,

498
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:46,474
you know,

499
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,590
I,

500
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,450
I people just let him
slide them on in their,

501
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:50,831
the owners,

502
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:51,221
you know,

503
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:54,340
and slowly and slowly he was accepted.

504
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,190
You know,

505
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,990
it seems like that can't last.

506
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,131
It seems like,

507
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:58,401
you know,

508
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,200
rappers have a short shelf life anyway.

509
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:03,650
A lot of them mean there's dudes like Jay
z and Nas that we'll just stick around

510
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:06,350
just cause they're so
talented he can't stop them.

511
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,333
But a lot of rappers,

512
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,730
they,

513
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,160
they come for a little while and
then I kind of think this is,

514
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,590
this is going to take wind
out of his sale eventually.

515
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,330
Well,

516
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:13,780
I dunno,

517
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,251
you know when,

518
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:14,500
when,

519
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,020
when those people put labels,

520
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,440
put that money behind you and,

521
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,300
and you become made their money cow.

522
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,990
You know,

523
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,880
they have a sense of,

524
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:21,071
of,

525
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:23,500
of just shoving you
down everybody's throat,

526
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:23,741
you know,

527
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,040
keeping you on the radio in
anything people hear on the radio,

528
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:27,371
you know,

529
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,100
they believe it

530
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,080
or at once they can get money out of you.

531
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,790
They know that keep
getting money out of you.

532
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,080
So they just use you as a cow.

533
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,340
They just use you as a cow.

534
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:36,650
So they keep milking you
and keep milking you and,

535
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:36,921
and,

536
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,420
and it's going to be up
to the people to say,

537
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:39,254
you know what,

538
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,550
when,

539
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:39,780
okay,

540
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,600
how many times you shoved
this guy and I face,

541
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,500
we're not buying.

542
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,070
You know,

543
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,570
we know he's a correctional officer.

544
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:46,130
We know he never sold drugs.

545
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,611
You know,

546
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:47,930
he's a fake and we know he sold,

547
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:48,890
he stole Rick Ross,

548
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:49,400
his name.

549
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,600
It's got your name tattooed on his
body and we want him to give it back.

550
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,261
You know what I'm saying?

551
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:54,490
That's what the streets
need you to tell him.

552
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:54,790
You know,

553
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,300
get Rick back is fucking man.

554
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,740
I'll give him back his fucking name
if it makes me feel any better.

555
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:04,610
He was on a TV show and he left his hat
there and our friend Tom Segura stole

556
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:07,090
his hat and he wears it every,

557
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:07,924
every day.

558
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,471
Oh,

559
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:12,520
that's hilarious.

560
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,571
That's beautiful.

561
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:13,751
Yeah.

562
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,041
Tom,

563
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,120
who was excited though.

564
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:15,954
I want to talk to you.

565
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,470
He's a standup comedian.

566
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,333
Good friend of mine.

567
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,660
Now your story is you were aspiring
tennis star and then you went on to make

568
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,930
some women than neighborhood roughly of
like $600 million from selling crack in

569
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,150
Los Angeles in like two years.

570
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:31,661
I did that.

571
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,800
That was my last two years.

572
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:35,500
I don't know before that
I made a lot of money,

573
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,760
but for those two years,

574
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,050
what's really crazy is that
this all has a connection,

575
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,300
not just to Los Angeles,

576
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,450
but to Ronald Reagan and Oliver
North and the contras in Nicaragua.

577
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,980
This is what a lot of people don't know.

578
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:54,040
There's crazy conspiracy theories
and people always talking about,

579
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,431
Oh man,

580
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:56,500
the CIA sells drugs and,

581
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,551
and then you know,

582
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:57,820
uh,

583
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,640
Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone
and we never landed on the moon.

584
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:01,960
And when you talk about conspiracies,

585
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:02,291
people go,

586
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,730
what the fuck are you talking about?

587
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,713
You crazy asshole.

588
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,700
You really believe the CIA sold drugs?

589
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,421
Well then fucking,

590
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:07,631
yeah,

591
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:08,230
they did.

592
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,640
Not only did they sell drugs,

593
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:14,350
Michael Rupert exposed it when the CIA
director tried to come to watts and have

594
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,940
this big meaning to try to prove,

595
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:16,774
I remember that.

596
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,180
It's a bad motherfucker

597
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,010
Mac line.

598
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,843
Uh,

599
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,050
uh,

600
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,770
let me even in the own
investigation though,

601
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:25,390
to CIA admitted that,

602
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,020
knew about it,

603
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:32,060
that their operatives of selling drugs
now Dan reports to fund the contras

604
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:35,510
because the congress had cut off funding.

605
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,403
Absolutely.

606
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,360
So they needed money to fund the contras
war against the Sandinistas who are

607
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:42,650
backed by the Russians.

608
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,670
And this was during the Cold War and
they were supposedly worried that the

609
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:47,810
Russians were going to take over.

610
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:48,790
Nicaragua was of the,

611
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,820
there was an idea that

612
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,410
that was what they feared.

613
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,980
Uh,

614
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,220
you know,

615
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,330
I read a couple books on it after,

616
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,060
after I found out at the story broke,

617
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,100
I wanted to know more about
what I was involved in.

618
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,300
And what they feared is that the
Sandinistas basically Russia had gay,

619
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:07,310
the Sandinistas like a hundred million
dollars and congress had cut off all

620
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,200
monies to the contrast.

621
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,150
So they had to figure out a way to,

622
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,460
to,

623
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,430
to raise this money to defeat
this army that had $100 million,

624
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:16,940
you know,

625
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,481
back then,

626
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:21,050
I guess a hundred million dollars probably
would be equivalent to $1 billion.

627
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:21,920
Right now today.

628
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,650
So they were looking for ways to,

629
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,543
to,

630
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,200
to raise this money.

631
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:30,440
So what they decided to do
was sell weapons to Iran,

632
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,550
convert that money back to
Nicaragua to these guys.

633
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,370
And these guys could take that money
and going by drugs that way it wouldn't

634
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,080
leave a paper trail back to the u s and,

635
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,930
and that's basically what they did.

636
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,760
And that's what got exposed with the,

637
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:43,941
uh,

638
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:45,470
the Oliver North trial.

639
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,370
And that's what Ronald Reagan had to
get on TV and said he couldn't remember.

640
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,030
Yeah.

641
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,380
Yeah.

642
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,410
I couldn't remember whether or not
they sold arms to people who hate us.

643
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,771
And then,

644
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:55,071
you know,

645
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:56,840
two in the carry investigations,

646
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:01,190
they told him to stop right at the drugs
when they started to go into the part

647
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:04,040
about the trafficking
in the cocaine they had,

648
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,060
it's not the hearings.

649
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,830
Why did they have the
hearing stopped right there?

650
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,491
I don't know.

651
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:09,590
US too to inflammatory.

652
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,533
Yeah,

653
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,610
I guess so.

654
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,240
My,

655
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,360
my documentary is going to explore that.

656
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:14,991
My,

657
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:18,570
a producing director for my
documentary was sitting there in the,

658
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:19,520
in the Senate hearings.

659
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,660
So He's bringing all those tapes and
they were going to put document are going

660
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:24,080
to come out.

661
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,690
It's not coming.

662
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,140
Should be out in like
November of next year.

663
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,100
And we hope that now,

664
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:31,550
did you find out about this
connection between the countries,

665
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:31,980
the southern,

666
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,240
eastern,

667
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,710
all this while you were in jail?

668
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,701
Yes,

669
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,560
I was in jail was in 96.

670
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,050
So you have no idea
about the CIA connection?

671
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,321
No,

672
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:40,190
I didn't care man.

673
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,330
I was just trying to make money.

674
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:41,571
You know,

675
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:45,440
I was a a kid in south
central and I was illiterate.

676
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,101
I couldn't read,

677
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:47,230
couldn't write a,

678
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,350
and I found out that,

679
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:48,831
you know,

680
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:51,800
my tennis career was basically over
because I couldn't go to college.

681
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,510
It was no way I was going to college.

682
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,590
Where were you playing tennis,

683
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:54,680
you know,

684
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,880
like tournaments and stuff.

685
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,010
Yeah,

686
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,781
I played tournaments,

687
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,280
southern California tournaments.

688
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:58,821
And you know,

689
00:16:58,821 --> 00:16:59,810
when you play those tournaments,

690
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,880
you don't have to turn
in your report card.

691
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:02,091
You know,

692
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:02,901
you just go out and play.

693
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:03,770
They don't ask you that.

694
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,170
I also played high school tennis and,

695
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:07,004
uh,

696
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,730
I had dreams of going to college and
playing college tennis and all that was

697
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:11,390
derailed.

698
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,170
Uh,

699
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:12,411
you know,

700
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,300
when it was discovered that
I couldn't read or write.

701
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,673
Wow.

702
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,980
How did you get through schools?

703
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:17,751
You couldn't read or write?

704
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:18,584
They just pass you.

705
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,101
Yeah man.

706
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:19,341
You know,

707
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:19,761
teachers,

708
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:21,050
they don't really care about

709
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,590
if you get in your education or not.

710
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,970
And for sure at that time,

711
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,490
and by me being a,

712
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,450
uh,

713
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,800
a good student,

714
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:35,540
I guess they just kind of like felt they
were doing me a favor by just let me

715
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,374
get through.

716
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,820
But being a good student,

717
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:39,710
how can you be a good student
if you can't read or write?

718
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:39,900
Well,

719
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,140
I didn't cause him any problems some,

720
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:46,520
so you were just dealing with a wild
bunch of kids and you are a nice guy,

721
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,210
right?

722
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,140
Sit in my seat,

723
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:48,391
you know,

724
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:50,670
probably go to in class most of the time,

725
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,180
you know.

726
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,750
Wow.

727
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,500
You know,

728
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,000
don't call the teacher no problems.

729
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:54,211
You know,

730
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:55,470
if it was time for me to read,

731
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,101
I would,

732
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:56,820
uh,

733
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,810
go to principal office,

734
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:58,521
get my squats.

735
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:00,930
So being bad in class
that day and you know,

736
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,790
the next day I'd come
back and go back to sleep.

737
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,890
Wow.

738
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,770
Isn't it amazing that the standards are
so low that all you have to do to be a

739
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:10,100
good student is not be
crazy and a problem?

740
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,221
Exactly.

741
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,630
You don't have to participate at all.

742
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,740
That's amazing.

743
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,930
And I never really participated in class,

744
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,441
you know,

745
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:17,400
none that I can remember.

746
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:17,601
Well,

747
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:21,170
I've always said that the number one
problem with this country for sure is that

748
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:22,940
we don't care about other people's kids.

749
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,040
We don't care about how other
people's kids are growing up.

750
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,490
We don't care if it's not your kid.

751
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:26,780
That's,

752
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,650
that's illiterate.

753
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:27,980
If not,

754
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,251
it's not.

755
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:29,570
Your kid is growing up without a father.

756
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:29,901
It's not.

757
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,300
Your kid is growing up in poverty,

758
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,260
doesn't know where their next meal is.

759
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,290
You don't give a fuck.

760
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,750
But meanwhile you give a fuck about
what's happening in another part of the

761
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:36,171
world.

762
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:36,351
You know,

763
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:39,650
freedom of Afghanistan and all this
nutty shit that went on in Iraq.

764
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,060
It are real.

765
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:44,780
War is with the our own people
that we have to live with.

766
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:46,340
Our own national community.

767
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,090
A national community has six spots
and these six parts of the ghettos,

768
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,110
and it's real simple.

769
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:51,591
If you're,

770
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:51,950
you're,

771
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,800
you get unlucky roll the dice and
you're born in that sixth spot,

772
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,580
well guess what?

773
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,413
You're fucked.

774
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,051
You're fucked.

775
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,240
You got to figure out a way
out of that somehow or another,

776
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,130
but the odds are long against you,

777
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,100
long against you and
that's a real travesty.

778
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,580
It is.

779
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,420
We as human beings concentrate on some
shit that's going on in another part of

780
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:08,831
the world.

781
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:11,770
It's not even connected to us and we don't
concentrate on people that work about

782
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,940
fucking coming contact
with has been in bill.

783
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:14,510
Yeah.

784
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,860
Spending more than that.

785
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:19,010
Trillions and we're not concentrating
on the people that were really going to

786
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:22,550
come in contact with the people that are
going to grow up and be a problem with

787
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:26,600
everybody they interact with because their
life is fucked from the get go and be

788
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:27,680
a problem for your kids.

789
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,560
Just imagine,

790
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,370
you know,

791
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,640
in a few years your kid is walking down
the street and he run into one of these

792
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:34,061
kids.

793
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:34,661
They exactly,

794
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:35,380
I didn't get it,

795
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:35,930
you know,

796
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,240
and you'd get robbed there.

797
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,800
Your situation is so crazy.

798
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,330
It's so hard to wrap your head around.

799
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,770
You know that you,

800
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,270
you were involved,

801
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,190
you were like a part of this gigantic
machine and you don't even know about it.

802
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,390
You just won't.

803
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,090
You just were trying to sell
crack and gave me a some money.

804
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,450
They gave me a way out.

805
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,313
You know,

806
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,330
you look at how did it start?

807
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,250
How do I start selling?

808
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,760
Yeah.

809
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,271
Oh Man.

810
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:04,970
I was sitting on my porch one day and
I was so broke and one of my big homeys

811
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:05,701
call him and he say,

812
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:06,534
man,

813
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,100
I got the new thing.

814
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,001
I said,

815
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:09,300
Huh?

816
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,581
He say,

817
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:09,841
man,

818
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,860
come over here right now.

819
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,940
So I jumped in my car at old 66 Chevrolet
and I throw a dollar worth of gas and

820
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:19,380
then I drove to his house.

821
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,670
It might have been my last dollar.

822
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:24,090
Right.

823
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,923
Wow.

824
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,380
I'm like,

825
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,780
wow.

826
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,210
I put my last out in the tank.

827
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,110
I'm through now.

828
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,940
So when I get to his house,

829
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:30,181
he,

830
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:31,014
uh,

831
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,640
he,

832
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,473
he laid it out,

833
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,060
you know,

834
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,380
it was cocaine,

835
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,520
you know,

836
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:35,971
and he was like,

837
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:36,181
man,

838
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,020
this is the new thing.

839
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,080
And I saw the movie
super fly and I'm like,

840
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,943
wow,

841
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,730
super fly.

842
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,693
That's me.

843
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,310
You know,

844
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,230
not always wanted.

845
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:47,480
When I saw fly,

846
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,701
man,

847
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:49,750
I just love that movie.

848
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,261
You know,

849
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:50,500
when,

850
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,870
when it's hilarious now
they try watching it now.

851
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,940
It's Kinda hilarious.

852
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,431
Yeah.

853
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:54,860
Yeah.

854
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,990
I might have to do that.

855
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,430
You know,

856
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:56,740
when I,

857
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,040
when I,

858
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,860
when I finally bought my first VCR,

859
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,010
just the way they're dressed,

860
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,940
the way they talk,

861
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,601
he goes,

862
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:02,351
my hall,

863
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:03,400
my vines,

864
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:03,731
he goes,

865
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,110
this is all I ever wanted in life.

866
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,981
My whole,

867
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,410
my vines or white woman like you,

868
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,391
my hall.

869
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:10,991
Like that's what these,

870
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:11,710
they call their cart.

871
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,480
My vines was his close,

872
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,781
you know,

873
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:15,760
it's like the nicknames were hilarious.

874
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:16,690
The ones that didn't stick,

875
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,410
I haven't watched that
since like 82 or something,

876
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:20,950
man.

877
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,670
Wow.

878
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:21,840
We,

879
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,300
when I bought my first VCR,

880
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:23,501
I mean,

881
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:24,850
that was the first one I had.

882
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,560
I threw it right up in there.

883
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:27,370
Whoop.

884
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:27,910
Wow.

885
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,241
Okay.

886
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:28,750
So,

887
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,491
so you,

888
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:30,820
you go over your friends house,

889
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,710
he's got it all done.

890
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,600
This is crack or this is
not just cocaine or crack.

891
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,221
It's powder.

892
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:35,330
Yeah.

893
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:35,690
Right.

894
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,523
But uh,

895
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,330
he's cooking it in the rock at that time.

896
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,811
Now who,

897
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,370
who taught everybody to cook it?

898
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,870
How the fuck did that come about?

899
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:44,030
Because that to me is a massive mystery.

900
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:47,100
There's someone figured out how to
take cocaine and turn it into a more or

901
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:47,730
addictive,

902
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,340
it was already guys
cooking it when I started.

903
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:50,580
Right.

904
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,880
But it was only a few of them but it's
free base is different than crack,

905
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,480
right?

906
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,690
Yeah.

907
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,380
Freebasing Richard prior had a freeway
but it's still the same product.

908
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,050
They would cook but they were
just taking coke and cooking it.

909
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:01,884
How were they doing it?

910
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,970
You cooked it with ether.

911
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:03,870
Oh.

912
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,000
Which was a much more difficult process,

913
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,190
but it's still the same product.

914
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,653
Technically.

915
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,540
The only difference is that uh,

916
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,690
with with free base,

917
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,261
I mean with,

918
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:13,531
with,

919
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:13,801
with,

920
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,500
with what they call crack
cause we didn't call it crack.

921
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,510
We called it ready rock ready rock.

922
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:18,691
Yeah.

923
00:22:18,691 --> 00:22:19,830
We call it ready rock.

924
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,500
The differences with ready
rock cause you use baking soda.

925
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,560
Now what I did is in my neighborhood
was three guys that could cook it.

926
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,620
These guys were very expensive,

927
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,351
very,

928
00:22:34,351 --> 00:22:35,580
very expensive to cook it.

929
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,510
So what I did is once I learn
how to cook it from these guys,

930
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:42,570
cause I kept watching them do it over
and over and over again and they keep

931
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,730
charging me for the cook three grams,

932
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:48,210
they might charge you
$175 so I'll keep paying.

933
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,290
How is three three grams cross?

934
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,233
What is it?

935
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,240
Three grants back then?

936
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:59,241
Three grams would have been about $900
so at a $900 you're paying 175 bucks.

937
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,743
Pretty Pricey.

938
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,500
It was.

939
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,760
It was pricey for what they did.

940
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,920
It took them 10 minutes,

941
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:05,754
15 minutes.

942
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,040
Getting the coke is the hard part.

943
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,541
That's really hard.

944
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,620
But then you got to cook it up.

945
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:11,310
So you know,

946
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,210
that was another part.

947
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:15,210
But once I learned how to do it when
I did is I just started showing all my

948
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:16,290
little friends how to do it,

949
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,101
you know?

950
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:18,810
So that became like a job for them.

951
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:19,920
They could just cook and make,

952
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,290
you know what other guys were charging?

953
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,120
175 they could charge 125 and and,

954
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,951
and you know,

955
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:26,880
and just sold a market though.

956
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,980
It's weird that coke is expensive,

957
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,880
but crack is not [inaudible] not true.

958
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,900
That's a misconception.

959
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:34,800
There's a misconception.

960
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,330
Big misconception.

961
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,260
Crack is expensive.

962
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,260
There is no crack without coke.

963
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,100
Right?

964
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,650
So if you took a Kia coke
and you cooked it in a crack,

965
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,820
the price don't drop.

966
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,020
So what,

967
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,970
what is the benefit?

968
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:49,900
Price goes up,

969
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,770
the price goes up.

970
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,850
You make more money.

971
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,950
Do you need less to get high?

972
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:54,581
Is that what it is?

973
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:55,031
No,

974
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:55,510
no,

975
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,000
no,

976
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,833
it,

977
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,240
it don't really have anything
to do with the high c.

978
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:03,910
If you spend 40,000 for a key or powder,

979
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,590
you still got to get at least
40,000 for the key or cooked.

980
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,930
Where people think that it's cheaper than
some misconception that they have put

981
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:16,090
in people mind that that rock is cheaper.

982
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,591
No,

983
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:16,651
no,

984
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:16,760
no,

985
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:16,871
no,

986
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:16,931
no,

987
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:17,141
no,

988
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:17,410
no.

989
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,450
It's still the same key of cocaine.

990
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,850
You still have to get
your money back out of it.

991
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,020
If you spend 40,000,

992
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:26,020
you still got to sell
that rock for 40,000.

993
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:26,180
Okay.

994
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,460
What is the benefit of
turning it into rock?

995
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:28,930
Done?

996
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,010
They can smoke it.

997
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,390
Yeah.

998
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,223
Is that better?

999
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,280
It's a better high,

1000
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:33,851
they say then,

1001
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:34,150
then,

1002
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,080
then smoking powder.

1003
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,070
Is it a,

1004
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,320
do you need less of it
to get high that way?

1005
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,240
Uh,

1006
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,750
no.

1007
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,440
So No.

1008
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,580
So there's no benefit financially go
in the way of crack or post to coke if

1009
00:24:44,581 --> 00:24:45,050
you're

1010
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,411
no,

1011
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:46,130
you're fucked up.

1012
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,570
Take powder and put on their pipe,

1013
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,920
it's going to burn different.

1014
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,060
He said it turns the
pipe all black and gooey.

1015
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,150
Uh,

1016
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,900
but rock it took all the
impurities out of the coke.

1017
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,560
So now you're just
smoking pure cocaine and,

1018
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:00,981
and,

1019
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:02,930
and they liked that better.

1020
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,410
And that's what the baking soda,

1021
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:06,480
that's where the baking
Soda Baking Soda did.

1022
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,261
Check our holes,

1023
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:08,980
the impurities out as much.

1024
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:09,581
Right.

1025
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:11,570
It cooked all the
impurities out of it and,

1026
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,270
and turn it into a jail.

1027
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,380
Now you,

1028
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:14,761
you,

1029
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:15,541
you meet this guy,

1030
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,500
you go over his house,

1031
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,090
he's got the coke and you know,

1032
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:18,721
you decide,

1033
00:25:18,721 --> 00:25:18,991
all right,

1034
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:19,561
this is it.

1035
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,251
This is what I'm gonna do.

1036
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:21,150
I'm going to be super fly.

1037
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:22,190
Now look,

1038
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,670
did a light bulb go off in your head?

1039
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,573
Not Unbelieving,

1040
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,180
man.

1041
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,570
Really.

1042
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,480
He showed me some was about the size of a,

1043
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:31,660
I'm one of those little match hasn't told
me it was worth $50 this is my boy too

1044
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:31,841
though.

1045
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:32,550
You know,

1046
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,191
it's my boy.

1047
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:33,401
Right?

1048
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:34,480
If it had been somebody else,

1049
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,314
I never would've,

1050
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,490
I wouldn't even touch it.

1051
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,590
But this was my boy telling me this.

1052
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:39,310
He said,

1053
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,551
man,

1054
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:40,780
that's where $50.

1055
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:41,320
I'm like,

1056
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,740
wow,

1057
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,131
come on,

1058
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:42,964
Mike stopped it.

1059
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,700
$50 man.

1060
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,800
The police would never catch me with that.

1061
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,070
You know what I'm talking about something
so small you could barely see it.

1062
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,341
You know,

1063
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:55,270
I can put it in my fingernails and he
tells me that's where $50 in and I just

1064
00:25:55,271 --> 00:26:00,160
spent my last dollar on gas and now you're
telling me that this little thing is

1065
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:02,920
worth 50 so I can make my money back.

1066
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,540
What's $40 and he gave it to me.

1067
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:05,590
He'll take it and go,

1068
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,663
wow.

1069
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,361
So,

1070
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:07,720
uh,

1071
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,051
you know,

1072
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:11,080
I go and I'm going around trying to
figure out what is it really coped,

1073
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:11,291
you know,

1074
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,000
so I'm going to everybody in the accident,

1075
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:13,481
an accident,

1076
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:14,860
nobody really knew what it was.

1077
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,010
What year was this?

1078
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,230
79 and [inaudible] 79.

1079
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,480
Beginning of 80.

1080
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,260
Now in the 80s.

1081
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:24,520
For people who don't know,

1082
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:24,881
I,

1083
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:25,210
uh,

1084
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,850
I was living in Boston at the time and uh,

1085
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:30,430
I remember when crack hit and it was,

1086
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,640
it was like a wave of
crime just took over.

1087
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:34,391
It was weird.

1088
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:39,391
It was like a real noticeable increase
in crime once crack had become a part of

1089
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,374
the culture.

1090
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:42,781
Well,

1091
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:43,260
you know,

1092
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,531
when,

1093
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:43,800
when,

1094
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,960
when people start smoking cocaine,

1095
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,710
they going to do whatever they can to,

1096
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,720
to keep that high going,

1097
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,703
you know,

1098
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,731
beg,

1099
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:54,391
steal,

1100
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:55,320
borrow.

1101
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,520
You know,

1102
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:56,881
I mean,

1103
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:01,770
it was something about it where they
said was so joyful that you never want it

1104
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:02,400
to stop.

1105
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,233
Wow.

1106
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:04,860
Some,

1107
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,590
some guys who just said was the best
sensation that didn't ever happen.

1108
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,810
You never fucked with it.

1109
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,990
I tried it about one week,

1110
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:13,880
maybe week and a half for a whole week.

1111
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,480
Yeah.

1112
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,170
Damn.

1113
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,290
Was this in the beginning?

1114
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:18,830
Yeah.

1115
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,221
Gaining.

1116
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,600
I caught myself early.

1117
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,000
Know I went through a phase where,

1118
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,361
you know,

1119
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:25,700
we thought we had came up
on some money and then,

1120
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:26,690
you know,

1121
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,530
I thought I was rich.

1122
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:31,460
I had about 10,000 and then
all my friends are like,

1123
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:31,700
man,

1124
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,061
come on,

1125
00:27:32,061 --> 00:27:32,420
let's smoke.

1126
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,340
So I mean we'd,

1127
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,913
wow.

1128
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,360
And I am the good thing though.

1129
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:38,220
I'd never smoked weed before in my life.

1130
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,403
That's a good thing.

1131
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,270
It was at that time.

1132
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:42,840
Yeah.

1133
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,380
So that,

1134
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,480
that probably what helps
save me from becoming a,

1135
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:48,960
an an an addict

1136
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,010
so that you weren't used
to smoke and things.

1137
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,461
Right.

1138
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,390
I wasn't used to smoking.

1139
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:53,290
I was a tennis player,

1140
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:53,481
you know?

1141
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:53,680
Right,

1142
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:53,891
right,

1143
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:54,101
right.

1144
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:54,690
You were healthy.

1145
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,351
I was healthy.

1146
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:56,790
So when I started smoking,

1147
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,420
you know,

1148
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,770
started putting the lacing in in the
weed and smoking and then I looked up,

1149
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,760
my money was like,

1150
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,280
wow man,

1151
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:04,860
you,

1152
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,430
you had 10,000 you down to like

1153
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,540
500 now.

1154
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,650
Oh Wow.

1155
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,330
Yeah.

1156
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,000
That quick,

1157
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,630
that quick.

1158
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,463
It was going to quit.

1159
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,373
Stop.

1160
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,120
No,

1161
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,570
no,

1162
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,081
I just quit.

1163
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:14,321
I said,

1164
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:14,501
man,

1165
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:16,030
this ain't what you went
into the game for it.

1166
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,470
But was it difficult physically?

1167
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:18,400
Did you have a withdrawal?

1168
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:18,581
No.

1169
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:19,414
Withdraws?

1170
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,291
No.

1171
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,460
When you have a strong mind,

1172
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,640
you probably pulled yourself weak,

1173
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,880
you know,

1174
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,930
I think that's all it takes.

1175
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,590
I did,

1176
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,790
I did it for about a week and I never
felt the addiction like I did the baking

1177
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:31,720
soda thing where,

1178
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,910
how often did you do it for that week?

1179
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:36,040
I probably did it twice.

1180
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:36,791
Three times.

1181
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:37,624
Two Times a day?

1182
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,040
No,

1183
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,430
no,

1184
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,761
no.

1185
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,470
I mean three times for the whole week.

1186
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,640
But I mean,

1187
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,660
I was also doing a lot of cocaine
at that point and I never got,

1188
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,740
I never liked the snack.

1189
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,540
Is it a,

1190
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,710
some people get addicted to,

1191
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:52,180
some people don't want to let you know.

1192
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:55,450
You gotta you gotta pull yourself and
you got to find a reason why you want to

1193
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:55,920
quit.

1194
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,320
Right.

1195
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,280
See some people,

1196
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,581
you know,

1197
00:28:57,581 --> 00:28:58,391
like I got an uncle,

1198
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:00,550
he's been getting high
since the day I started.

1199
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,370
And you know what he tells me what?

1200
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,590
Quit.

1201
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,020
Wow.

1202
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,853
What am I quit for?

1203
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,440
We had a friend who was a comedian who
was a heroin addict who wound up dying.

1204
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,650
Mitch Hedberg.

1205
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,520
Very funny guy.

1206
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,031
Really,

1207
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:16,870
really funny dude.

1208
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,700
And they tried to stop him a few times.

1209
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:18,971
It's like,

1210
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:19,181
bitch,

1211
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:20,140
I ain't stopping shit.

1212
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,350
That was his attitude is this is me.

1213
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,240
I mean a person should be allowed to do
whatever it is with their life as long

1214
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:30,520
as they don't hurt anybody else.

1215
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,860
Infringe on your rights
that they want to do.

1216
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,630
I agree 100% now you're,

1217
00:29:34,631 --> 00:29:35,530
you're sitting there,

1218
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:35,771
you're,

1219
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:37,030
how old were you when this happened?

1220
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,170
When I started?

1221
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:39,370
Yeah.

1222
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,800
1820 1920 so you're 20

1223
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,980
you get started in it and then how
do you go about going from that to

1224
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,921
everything?

1225
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:50,320
Branching out to you be in the biggest,

1226
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,490
most famous guy

1227
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,150
was,

1228
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:52,983
it was,

1229
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,060
I guess you would say like an evolution,

1230
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:55,301
you know,

1231
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:56,350
learning process.

1232
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:56,951
You know,

1233
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:00,190
the first time I learned that first piece
of cocaine I got and I got beat out of

1234
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:00,910
it.

1235
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,860
Another one of my big
homies beat me out of it,

1236
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,581
you know,

1237
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:04,510
told me they met him,

1238
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,610
tested and let him smoke it.

1239
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,011
And you know,

1240
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:07,130
it wasn't big as a match head.

1241
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,170
So he cut it in half and he smoked a
piece of it and he was not going home.

1242
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,590
That's the way they used to do.

1243
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:16,120
You know when they smoke it and smack,

1244
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:19,260
they Lipson taste some let me know.

1245
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,220
I need another piece though
to make sure it's good.

1246
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,120
You don't want to go
out and sell a nun name.

1247
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:23,963
Right.

1248
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,480
Chipped it again.

1249
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:28,300
And the whole thing was gone and it
was a little teeny weeny piece left.

1250
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:28,751
And he's like,

1251
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:29,584
man,

1252
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,620
I'm going to go and smoke that too
and then I'll just pay you Friday.

1253
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,340
Ah,

1254
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,410
pay you Friday's never happened.

1255
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:39,130
Never has a hamburger today ever.

1256
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,780
It never,

1257
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,950
I never got that 50.

1258
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,740
Never.

1259
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,810
We probably never will those,

1260
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:43,021
those,

1261
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,250
I'll pay you Friday guys.

1262
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:45,084
They never,

1263
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,930
they don't.

1264
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,860
So that was my,

1265
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,580
uh,

1266
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,930
business in the cocaine.

1267
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,000
So right away you wouldn't,

1268
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,291
okay.

1269
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,570
I got to be a little more
prudent with my fucking,

1270
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,770
my resources here.

1271
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,060
It started in the end,

1272
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:56,681
it right there,

1273
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:56,901
right?

1274
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:57,190
Yeah.

1275
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,720
I felt like my career was over because
how was I going to go back to Mike and

1276
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:02,471
telling my man,

1277
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:03,730
I'm going to go tell my man,

1278
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,541
man,

1279
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,190
I ain't got the $50 man.

1280
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,210
Wow,

1281
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,351
I want to re up,

1282
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:10,060
but I don't know how to 50 but uh,

1283
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:11,720
what happened is,

1284
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:16,090
is that guy who beat me out to 50
and he taught me another lesson.

1285
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,170
He come right back that day
with somebody that won $100.

1286
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,280
See,

1287
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,730
like with,

1288
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:21,921
with,

1289
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,161
with,

1290
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:22,450
with,

1291
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,800
with people who use,

1292
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,940
if they owe you,

1293
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,060
then they'll come when they bring
somebody else with them and say,

1294
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:28,421
oh man,

1295
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:29,110
this ain't my money.

1296
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,943
It's his money.

1297
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,460
Okay,

1298
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,860
that's hilarious.

1299
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,860
So he came back with somebody
wanting to buy $100 worth.

1300
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,690
And I called my man.

1301
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:37,931
I said,

1302
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:38,440
man,

1303
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,810
I ain't got your 50 but uh,

1304
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,160
somebody else want to buy
$100 but for you won't it?

1305
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,500
And he shot over there serving that.

1306
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:45,670
And next thing you know,

1307
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,630
this guy who beat me out to 50,

1308
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,120
kept bringing person after person,

1309
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:49,721
after person.

1310
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:52,870
And next thing I know
I'm making $200 a day,

1311
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,010
$300 a day,

1312
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,980
but now I'm giving all
the money to my man.

1313
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,653
And uh,

1314
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,141
you know,

1315
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:00,040
one day I was just like,

1316
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:00,251
man,

1317
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,780
I'm going into business for myself.

1318
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,520
So how did you get a distributor?

1319
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,160
We're started just like that.

1320
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:07,870
I started off just getting it from him.

1321
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:08,870
And then,

1322
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,703
uh,

1323
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,141
I've been,

1324
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:11,974
uh,

1325
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:16,490
talking about going to Venice skill
center to do upholstery and me and this a

1326
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,291
teacher there,

1327
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,030
they taught the class had become really,

1328
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:19,840
really good friends.

1329
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,700
We played tennis together and,

1330
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:22,534
um,

1331
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,170
I just stopped going around him because
I spent all my time selling coke.

1332
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:27,191
And,

1333
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:27,370
uh,

1334
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,420
one day I go down,

1335
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:28,750
you know,

1336
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,570
just to see him because this was
my man and I hadn't seen him.

1337
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:32,021
And I said,

1338
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:32,501
man,

1339
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:33,280
uh,

1340
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,901
how you doing?

1341
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:34,360
And he's like,

1342
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,580
well,

1343
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,620
what are you being mad?

1344
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:36,611
I was like,

1345
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:37,444
man,

1346
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,840
you don't want to know where been right.

1347
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,381
So,

1348
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:43,214
uh,

1349
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,090
I went on and told him,

1350
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:44,421
I was like,

1351
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:44,691
man,

1352
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:45,011
I've been a,

1353
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:45,844
I've been selling coke.

1354
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,300
You know what I'm doing now?

1355
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:47,640
He's like,

1356
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,473
what

1357
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,843
mommy?

1358
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,490
So he had a whole different attitude
and I thought he was going to have,

1359
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,411
but you know,

1360
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:58,550
he was flying and you know,

1361
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,210
I used to like his little jewelry and he,

1362
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,480
he'd do a brand new cat bag and all that.

1363
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,314
Right.

1364
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:03,831
So he said,

1365
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:04,041
man,

1366
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,060
come by the house.

1367
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,920
So I go by the house man.

1368
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:07,820
And he laid it all out.

1369
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:08,121
He's like,

1370
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:08,301
man,

1371
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:09,410
you think I got this house,

1372
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,190
this Cadillac,

1373
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,060
these clothes,

1374
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,880
and like this here on a teacher salary.

1375
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,350
No Way.

1376
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:15,750
He's said,

1377
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:15,981
man,

1378
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:17,090
I traveled the world.

1379
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,770
He said I should sell coke,

1380
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:20,300
but I just backed up for awhile.

1381
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,403
Whoa.

1382
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:21,801
So,

1383
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:22,100
uh,

1384
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,911
it's hard to do that,

1385
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:23,170
right?

1386
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,530
Have the Nicaraguan connection.

1387
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:24,971
Yeah.

1388
00:33:24,971 --> 00:33:25,761
You gotta be really,

1389
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:26,430
really strong.

1390
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,640
The backup without going to
prison or getting killed.

1391
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,950
It's very few people do write.

1392
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,880
Very few do.

1393
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,780
I don't know.

1394
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,651
I don't know.

1395
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:36,740
Not One person that
just quit on their own,

1396
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:37,191
I don't think,

1397
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:38,120
when I was going to prison.

1398
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,470
Wow.

1399
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,101
That's amazing.

1400
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:40,450
So,

1401
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,530
so this guy gets you the
Nicaraguan connection?

1402
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,150
Yeah,

1403
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,660
yeah,

1404
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:43,871
yeah.

1405
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:45,160
He called his guy up,

1406
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:45,521
man,

1407
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:46,354
and

1408
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,220
he's guy was like,

1409
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,500
I'm from Nicaragua.

1410
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:51,170
You know,

1411
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,280
spoke broken English
and gave me some prices,

1412
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:54,550
man.

1413
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,260
And it was like all love.

1414
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,711
I was like,

1415
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:56,891
man,

1416
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:57,724
I'm going to be rich.

1417
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,710
Wow.

1418
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,160
So,

1419
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,993
um,

1420
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,380
are you familiar with how they got
it into the country or at the time,

1421
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:07,470
did you know how they were getting into?

1422
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,111
Nah,

1423
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:08,700
I didn't care.

1424
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,160
I wasn't that big.

1425
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:10,680
You know,

1426
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,241
you're 20.

1427
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:12,240
I'm 20 years old.

1428
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,730
Never had nothing.

1429
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,570
You know,

1430
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,403
I hadn't had it.

1431
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,530
I had never had $1,000 before
I started selling coke.

1432
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,720
I don't know if I hadn't
had ever had $500.

1433
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,060
You know what I'm saying?

1434
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,340
Right,

1435
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:22,611
right,

1436
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:22,821
right.

1437
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:26,180
So I'm just thankful that
I'm in this position.

1438
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:27,560
I ain't asking no questions.

1439
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:28,770
You know what I'm saying?

1440
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,601
I'm like super fly.

1441
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:30,830
Don't ask no questions.

1442
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,160
And long as the man that you've eaten,

1443
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:33,830
man,

1444
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,850
leaving and long,

1445
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,301
you know,

1446
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:36,440
and that's the way I was.

1447
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,700
That was the attitude I had.

1448
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,430
I was just going along with the process.

1449
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,300
Wow,

1450
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,990
that's a,

1451
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,760
that's,

1452
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,420
that's gotta be a crazy position to be in,

1453
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:44,661
man.

1454
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:48,170
To all of a sudden it starts taking
off and you see it and then you're just

1455
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,040
rolling in this money.

1456
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:49,251
I mean,

1457
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:50,300
it really is like a movie,

1458
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:51,134
right?

1459
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,790
Did it feel like I'm moving to you?

1460
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,940
Like all of a sudden you go
from being broke to just pause.

1461
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,010
It was not a dream.

1462
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:57,281
You know,

1463
00:34:57,281 --> 00:34:57,511
you,

1464
00:34:57,511 --> 00:34:58,344
you feeling like,

1465
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,261
you know,

1466
00:34:59,261 --> 00:34:59,970
finally,

1467
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:00,460
uh,

1468
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,690
God had recognize you,

1469
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:02,651
you know,

1470
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:03,484
all this time,

1471
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,850
all this time you had been ignored
by God and now all of a sudden,

1472
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:07,684
you know,

1473
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,620
all the things that you prayed for and
hope would happen in your life had just

1474
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:12,454
taken place.

1475
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,120
Wow.

1476
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,180
That's a crazy way to put
that God had recognized you.

1477
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,080
That's how it felt,

1478
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,770
you know,

1479
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,161
honest.

1480
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:18,431
You know,

1481
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:20,560
I felt that it was a
blessing from God that,

1482
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:21,210
uh,

1483
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,680
then I had been putting
that position and now,

1484
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,011
you know,

1485
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:27,520
my family wouldn't have no more hungry
nights and we wouldn't be worried about

1486
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:30,400
the lights getting cut
off the gas and you know,

1487
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:32,830
those roaches and rats when going to
be running through the house no more.

1488
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:33,730
Cause I was going to get some,

1489
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,073
some uh,

1490
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,280
rat traps and traffic rid of them,

1491
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:38,771
you know,

1492
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:40,650
and we're just gonna
pass them hoes up in the,

1493
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,310
in the cabinets and you know,

1494
00:35:42,311 --> 00:35:43,510
all the things that,

1495
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:45,160
that I regretted when I was a kid,

1496
00:35:45,161 --> 00:35:45,551
you know,

1497
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:46,750
standing in line with food,

1498
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:48,250
Sam's all that was over with.

1499
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,920
Did you learn how to read it this time?

1500
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,001
Nah Man.

1501
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:52,840
I didn't know how to read.

1502
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,860
I went to prison.

1503
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:54,940
Wow.

1504
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,930
That's amazing.

1505
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,090
That's amazing.

1506
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,680
I was forced to learn how to read.

1507
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,730
What did you do with the money?

1508
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:01,660
Like how'd you bank

1509
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,180
man?

1510
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,200
I had big safes.

1511
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,120
I had safe.

1512
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,750
So they come out the Queen
Mary Way 2,500 pounds one time.

1513
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,250
They stole my safe on my house.

1514
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:11,521
I said,

1515
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:12,720
they'll never do that again.

1516
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,561
You know,

1517
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:17,040
this dude put me up on these saves
that it took like a little train track,

1518
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,090
the rang through and

1519
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,173
wow.

1520
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,920
They wasn't moving at bill professional
safe moving and moving them up at your

1521
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:25,780
house when they stole
the safe on your house.

1522
00:36:25,781 --> 00:36:26,710
How much was in the safe?

1523
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:27,560
Yeah,

1524
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,240
and I think,

1525
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,660
I think one time he
got like maybe 180,000.

1526
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:32,740
160,000

1527
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,260
wow.

1528
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,340
And cash in a safe and you
just weren't home or something.

1529
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:38,570
They knew when you were leaving.

1530
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,291
Yeah,

1531
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:39,681
yeah,

1532
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:39,891
yeah.

1533
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:42,620
They knew probably was an inside job.

1534
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:43,454
Of course.

1535
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
You know how that go on
in your family members.

1536
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,520
She opened the door and they're crazy.

1537
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,570
It's crazy to think about it,

1538
00:36:50,571 --> 00:36:50,930
isn't it?

1539
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,440
Yeah.

1540
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,190
Yeah.

1541
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,420
So then you got a big,

1542
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:54,830
giant safe and he kept it all in and say,

1543
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,410
you mean you had to be
locked out at all times?

1544
00:36:57,411 --> 00:36:58,850
If you have that kind of cash around,

1545
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:00,410
you're not dealing with banks at all.

1546
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:00,850
Like,

1547
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,481
oh no,

1548
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:01,841
no,

1549
00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:02,111
no,

1550
00:37:02,111 --> 00:37:02,291
no.

1551
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:03,160
I didn't go to no bank,

1552
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:03,790
man.

1553
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,780
Why don't my mom,

1554
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,673
she used to take,

1555
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,510
cause I had a couple of properties in my
name and my mom actually let her go and

1556
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,591
collect all the rents,

1557
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:12,640
my section eight checks.

1558
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,690
And uh,

1559
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,150
she was used to just throw them in the
bank because I paid the mortgages and

1560
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:16,690
stuff.

1561
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,620
I'm adult money and uh,

1562
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,550
the,

1563
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,430
the bankers used to say,

1564
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,690
tell your son to come in and

1565
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,633
Smithers

1566
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,900
he's doing pretty good in real estate.

1567
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:28,441
Wow.

1568
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:29,250
That's hilarious.

1569
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,670
So did you come up with a bunch of
businesses to sort of mask your money?

1570
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,021
Yeah,

1571
00:37:33,021 --> 00:37:33,260
I had,

1572
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,750
I acquainted,

1573
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,583
I had um,

1574
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,650
I had a custom time wheel shop,

1575
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,170
carwash,

1576
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,240
shoe store,

1577
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,350
a beauty salon junk.

1578
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:45,070
Your Moteo bought a old t eight or,

1579
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,200
and I had apartment
buildings all over the place.

1580
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:48,700
I used to build apartment buildings.

1581
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,050
That was like one of my hobbies.

1582
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,800
Did you have to show how you got the
money to buy any of these businesses are

1583
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:55,060
started in these businesses?

1584
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,781
I figured out how to,

1585
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:55,850
yeah,

1586
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,180
man.

1587
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,361
You know,

1588
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:57,860
people taught me how to launder the money.

1589
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,760
Right.

1590
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,110
How you go to the bank and you,

1591
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,590
you get the cashier's checks and you know,

1592
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,730
so we figured,

1593
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:05,210
you know,

1594
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:05,871
we figured it out,

1595
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:06,680
how to get around it.

1596
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,300
No.

1597
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,590
All this time you couldn't read.

1598
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,550
No.

1599
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,383
That's amazing.

1600
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,180
So when you went into the banks
and fill out the paperwork,

1601
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,260
how did you do that?

1602
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:14,651
Well,

1603
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:16,330
I would just have somebody
else to do it for me.

1604
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:16,721
You know,

1605
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:18,580
like if I'm buying a piece of property,

1606
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,440
the real estate agent
would do most of the work.

1607
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,250
Now I've had times where they told me
one thing and it wasn't what it was,

1608
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:24,910
you know,

1609
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,151
so,

1610
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:27,550
so those are the chances that you
take when you can't read or write.

1611
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,090
Wow.

1612
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,580
Like one time I had a
building that I bought in,

1613
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:35,860
they told me that the note was going to
be 3000 a month and old turn out to be

1614
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:37,060
6,200 a month.

1615
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,710
So it cost me like 3,200 a month
because I couldn't read the contract.

1616
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,320
So I mean,

1617
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:45,760
it's costly when you
don't know how to read.

1618
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,990
That's incredible that you accomplished
so much without learning how to read.

1619
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,410
That's,

1620
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,250
that's amazing.

1621
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:50,790
Well,

1622
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,790
you know what I felt is that I
had developed a sense of people,

1623
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,131
you know what,

1624
00:38:57,131 --> 00:39:00,100
I could feel good people
and bad people just,

1625
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:00,490
just,

1626
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,550
just sensing them who,

1627
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:02,020
who do,

1628
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,520
who to deal with and who not to deal with.

1629
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:04,211
And,

1630
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:04,451
you know,

1631
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:05,350
you make some mistakes,

1632
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:05,981
but you know,

1633
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:07,120
overall I think that,

1634
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:07,954
uh,

1635
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,130
you know,

1636
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,870
I did all right with some of them.

1637
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,340
So as long as you are making them money,

1638
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:13,240
everybody was making money.

1639
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:14,080
Everybody was happy.

1640
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,470
Yeah.

1641
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,651
Yeah.

1642
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:14,891
You know,

1643
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:16,840
I pay for a need a
baker's first album too.

1644
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,053
Wow.

1645
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,053
Seriously.

1646
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,591
Wow.

1647
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:20,080
That's awesome.

1648
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,310
Yeah.

1649
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,760
Finance Beverly Glen in music.

1650
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,623
Uh,

1651
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,670
oldest Smith

1652
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,420
was the owner of the label.

1653
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:26,254
Rest in peace.

1654
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,220
Uh,

1655
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,990
he used to take care of
me when I play tennis,

1656
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,390
you'll buy me tennis shoes and rackets.

1657
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:32,380
And so when I came up,

1658
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:35,500
I ran into him one day and he
wasn't doing all that well.

1659
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:35,860
So,

1660
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,693
you know,

1661
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,840
returning the favor.

1662
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,481
Oh Wow.

1663
00:39:38,481 --> 00:39:39,314
That's beautiful.

1664
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,260
But he got his 10 fold,

1665
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,020
you know,

1666
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,900
they say you get a ten four he used to
buy me a tennis shoes in a rag as I gave

1667
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:45,860
him 600,000

1668
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,190
wow.

1669
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,551
So you know,

1670
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:50,810
sometimes you do a good deed,

1671
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:51,830
they come back to you.

1672
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,491
It might be,

1673
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:52,940
you know,

1674
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,360
took,

1675
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,520
took 10 15 years,

1676
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,354
but

1677
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,630
so how did it all come apart

1678
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,411
man?

1679
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:03,030
It was coming apart from the beginning

1680
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,061
right away.

1681
00:40:07,061 --> 00:40:07,900
It was just crazy.

1682
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:08,081
Yeah.

1683
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:09,280
What winds up happening is,

1684
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:09,581
you know,

1685
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,060
they created this task force
called the freeway task force.

1686
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:13,580
Yeah.

1687
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,060
That was these group of
officers just to go after you.

1688
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:16,690
Yeah.

1689
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,351
You're a freeway.

1690
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:17,950
Ricky Ross.

1691
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,401
Yeah.

1692
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:18,671
Yeah.

1693
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:21,430
They said that my name was
ringing so much downtown.

1694
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,280
The city hall had a special meeting.

1695
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:26,800
Wow.

1696
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,060
I said,

1697
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,830
who is this guy in south central making
all this money and everybody and stop?

1698
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:35,720
Because what I found out is when I finally
got arrested is that not that people

1699
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:37,650
wouldn't really telling on me right.

1700
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:38,700
To get me in trouble.

1701
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,260
They was bragging about me.

1702
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,280
He had a homeboy wick.

1703
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,130
He eats millionaire.

1704
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,121
He got this,

1705
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:45,954
he got that.

1706
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,490
He wasn't the whole hood,

1707
00:40:47,491 --> 00:40:47,821
you know.

1708
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:52,821
So this is creating a hysteria
downtown and they're like,

1709
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:52,970
well,

1710
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,641
who is this guy?

1711
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,110
Why is everybody talking about him?

1712
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,161
And what I found out,

1713
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:58,020
these guys are in jail
talking about me to,

1714
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:58,471
you know,

1715
00:40:58,471 --> 00:40:59,990
like they sit in and holding tanks and,

1716
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,980
and they having conversations
with my freeway,

1717
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:02,640
Rick.

1718
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,060
And so the guards are hearing
this and they go and report it.

1719
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,630
And so now everybody wants
to know who is this guy?

1720
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,280
Imagine if it was Rick Ross,

1721
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:10,910
the fake record

1722
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,743
cross

1723
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,643
Rick Ross.

1724
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,610
And when a reporter,

1725
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:16,530
you imagine we find that shit out.

1726
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:17,364
Hey,

1727
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,730
I mean that's a goddamn
connection right there.

1728
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:22,320
We might've fucking
found the magic bullet.

1729
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,563
Ah,

1730
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,890
that's hilarious.

1731
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,310
So they hear about you through legend.

1732
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:34,941
You just,

1733
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:35,690
you'd just become,

1734
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,140
now are you aware of how famous
you are at this time in a shale?

1735
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,490
See my guys know that ain't,

1736
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,640
you can't talk about me and you talking
about meeting your girls and nobody

1737
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,350
could tell him what none of my business,

1738
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,880
right Dane in our business,

1739
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:51,020
they don't need to know our business,

1740
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,483
but

1741
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,210
it wind up getting past the line.

1742
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:57,400
You know when you got that line,

1743
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,050
but it jumped over that
line and everybody knew.

1744
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,411
Yeah,

1745
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:01,160
it became public.

1746
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,030
You had no idea.

1747
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,260
I had no idea it was public.

1748
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,370
You thought you were just like,

1749
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,310
like a cat hundred of the couch and
you think you're hidden but your tails

1750
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:08,144
poking out.

1751
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,900
You know,

1752
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,990
they think you could see him.

1753
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:13,220
He like,

1754
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,490
it's,

1755
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,430
I see you mine,

1756
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,430
you are mine.

1757
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,070
And that's what I was living under.

1758
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:21,130
I was living under that illusion that,

1759
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,680
that nobody knew who I was because
I didn't drive the fancy cars.

1760
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:25,220
You know,

1761
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,500
I could walk in a restaurant
and nobody would spot me.

1762
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:27,910
Right,

1763
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,071
right,

1764
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:28,251
right,

1765
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:28,550
right.

1766
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,290
They wouldn't be pointing
on that go wreck over there.

1767
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:31,430
So you kept it low key.

1768
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:32,750
You stayed in the same house.

1769
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:33,681
Uh,

1770
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:33,951
you know,

1771
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,930
I had houses all over a bunch of houses,

1772
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:36,681
a bunch of houses,

1773
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:37,514
but they wasn't,

1774
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,420
you know,

1775
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,660
I level didn't get you get a match it,

1776
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:41,440
it's nothing crazy.

1777
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,190
Right?

1778
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:45,800
Pasadena estates with giant
lawns and fountains and shit.

1779
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:46,221
None of that,

1780
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:46,520
right?

1781
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,030
Yeah.

1782
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,080
Not nothing like that.

1783
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:48,711
So I worked through,

1784
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:52,970
what else I found out though is that I
see my guys have become so big in their

1785
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:57,971
own rights is if they mentioned your
name one time to their little workers and

1786
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:01,880
then their workers run out.

1787
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:02,331
Oh man,

1788
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:04,490
the homie Rick took care of us.

1789
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:05,700
Okay.

1790
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,260
And these guys words were so powerful
that they would only have to mention you

1791
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:10,891
one time.

1792
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:11,131
You know,

1793
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:11,600
they like,

1794
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,000
uh,

1795
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,380
I guess you would call them almost like
evangelists and that you keep having

1796
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:18,300
these type of guys mentioned your name.

1797
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,740
Then the next thing you know,

1798
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:21,780
your name is everything.

1799
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,860
This is all what you summarized once
you've got into prison and really sat down

1800
00:43:25,861 --> 00:43:29,580
with all the time in the world
to analyze what was going on.

1801
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,410
How long did it last?

1802
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:33,690
How many years did you
sell for eight years?

1803
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,081
Eight years.

1804
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,640
So you're 28 when you got arrested?

1805
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,300
Yup.

1806
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,870
Wow,

1807
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:37,703
that's crazy.

1808
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,170
So you had lived so long
career for a drug dealer.

1809
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,910
It's huge.

1810
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:41,430
Yeah.

1811
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:41,641
Yeah.

1812
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:42,740
Most of my friends who,

1813
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:43,530
who started,

1814
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,960
you know and got big two years,

1815
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,130
three years and they go home.

1816
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,410
What kind of car were you
driving and try to stay low key.

1817
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,470
Yeah

1818
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:51,741
man.

1819
00:43:51,741 --> 00:43:56,741
I had a Ford Ltd station wagon with
the wood grain on the [inaudible] side.

1820
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:01,880
The little bird.

1821
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,270
Yup.

1822
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:02,520
You know,

1823
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,860
little funeral home bird.

1824
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,753
Wow.

1825
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,050
On the side of the windows.

1826
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,570
I had in 1981 of this,

1827
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,180
well wait a minute,

1828
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,991
the funeral home bird,

1829
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:10,280
did you have that on purpose?

1830
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:10,941
You put that on there.

1831
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:13,160
So it looked like a funeral home car.

1832
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,870
He had the police pulled
up on the side of that.

1833
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:15,570
They looked the other way.

1834
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,790
Nobody wouldn't look in that car.

1835
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,900
That's,

1836
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,770
that's hilarious.

1837
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:20,000
So it was almost like a hearse.

1838
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:22,250
You know how many people you know want
to look in the front of the Hong Kong?

1839
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:23,563
That's brilliant.

1840
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,980
That's fucking brilliant.

1841
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,160
So you were driving around in a scam car.

1842
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:28,551
Why?

1843
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:31,030
I knew that the police started
to pull that thing over and he,

1844
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,780
that's a little areas,

1845
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,990
but do you muscly look to
Ferrari's and Lamborghini's?

1846
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:37,831
God Damn,

1847
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:39,150
I could just go buy one of those.

1848
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,140
Oh my guys handled,

1849
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,501
you know,

1850
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:41,670
if I want to go out in the Ferrari,

1851
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:42,640
I just called one of my guy,

1852
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:43,000
man,

1853
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,880
I don't want to use your Ferrari.

1854
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,450
We denied.

1855
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,070
Oh that's cool.

1856
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,590
Yo Yo yo a vet.

1857
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,840
You the headaches,

1858
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:49,920
right?

1859
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,180
I ain't got to put it up.

1860
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,950
I ain't got to watch you get so smart.

1861
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,580
That's amazing.

1862
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,620
It just,

1863
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,610
it just started coming,

1864
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,001
you know,

1865
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:58,290
just little by little,

1866
00:44:58,291 --> 00:44:59,124
you know,

1867
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,211
some say no,

1868
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:00,511
no way.

1869
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:01,280
No jury.

1870
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,150
Because if you wear jewelry,

1871
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,570
everybody gonna know you sell drugs.

1872
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,191
I didn't want,

1873
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:06,600
my Mama didn't know I sold drugs.

1874
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,010
What did you tell your mom you were doing?

1875
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,211
I mean I didn't,

1876
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:09,571
you know,

1877
00:45:09,571 --> 00:45:09,810
she,

1878
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,250
when she found out I had all that money,

1879
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:11,671
man,

1880
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:12,504
she

1881
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,260
one day,

1882
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:14,890
uh,

1883
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:15,930
cause my spot is,

1884
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,660
it's like my spot was like two,

1885
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,060
two or three miles from my house.

1886
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,990
So what I would do is I would go to the
spot work and every time I'd get like

1887
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:28,380
2000 I'd run to the house and put
it up and went back to the track.

1888
00:45:28,381 --> 00:45:30,600
Cause you don't want to be standing out
on the track with too much money because

1889
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:31,560
the police come over with man.

1890
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,900
When you get to $3,000
what you doing on wall?

1891
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,640
This money problems.

1892
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,060
So what I would do is every time I'd get
a couple of thousand dollars I'd run to

1893
00:45:39,061 --> 00:45:39,900
the house and put it up.

1894
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,210
So my mom see me keep
running in the house,

1895
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:42,520
you know,

1896
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,040
back and forth back and will want it all.

1897
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:44,910
I'm doing this all day.

1898
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:45,570
All night.

1899
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:46,470
I don't do nothing else.

1900
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,150
I ain't got a girlfriend.

1901
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,161
I'm single.

1902
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:50,600
Right,

1903
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,950
right.

1904
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,220
This is my love is to be out on the track.

1905
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,650
I'm doing this 1819 hours a day.

1906
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,460
Wow.

1907
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,120
Sleeping.

1908
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,140
Jumped right back yet.

1909
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,950
Yeah.

1910
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,371
All the time.

1911
00:45:59,371 --> 00:45:59,761
Are you sleeping?

1912
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:00,210
You losing?

1913
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,220
Sometimes I sleep in the car on the smile,

1914
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:02,850
you know?

1915
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,720
Wow.

1916
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,310
With something with Shit on you.

1917
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,720
Just a little bit though.

1918
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,290
You packing a gun or when
I got my boy standing out,

1919
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,340
he's standing back like [inaudible]
we stand out on the street and we cut,

1920
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,600
we call the curve servant.

1921
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,420
Now I would be standing out on the curb
and then he would be sitting like in

1922
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:20,610
somebody's yard with the pistol.

1923
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,820
So if somebody got at me
or something like that,

1924
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:26,160
then he would just bust
out and start running.

1925
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:26,520
Right.

1926
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,330
So He's,

1927
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,450
he's from a different vantage points that
not even seeing him as a point and see

1928
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:30,631
him.

1929
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:32,130
It's like the police,

1930
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:35,970
if the police come in and re they going
to grab us standing out on the block and

1931
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:38,340
they're not going to bother him
because he's up in somebody's yard.

1932
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,091
So,

1933
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:39,331
you know,

1934
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:41,580
we had a little crazy
system that we had lined up,

1935
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:42,414
man.

1936
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,733
That's brilliant.

1937
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,210
So,

1938
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:45,750
um,

1939
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:46,250
you,

1940
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,880
you had a spot was like,

1941
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,820
like on a street corner
or something like that.

1942
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,910
Like there was an area that first,

1943
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,190
soon 81st in between Hoover in Vermont.

1944
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,740
It was like apartment complexes,

1945
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:56,671
you know,

1946
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:57,990
a bunch of apartment complexes.

1947
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,250
And how do you get a spot?

1948
00:46:59,251 --> 00:46:59,431
Like,

1949
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:01,410
what do other dudes try
to move in on your spot?

1950
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:03,180
Because they know that
everybody goes there to buy.

1951
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,030
Well,

1952
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,990
at that time nobody was trying to move
in on my spot because nobody really could

1953
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,010
get the cocaine.

1954
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,340
They didn't,

1955
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,260
they didn't know how valuable cocaine was.

1956
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,180
They didn't really,

1957
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:14,711
really,

1958
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:16,990
I had abandoned the spot when
other guys started coming in.

1959
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:17,681
You know,

1960
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:19,030
I had gotten so big,

1961
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:22,930
so I didn't stay on the street song
cause I took all my money and parlayed it

1962
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:23,860
back into the game.

1963
00:47:23,861 --> 00:47:28,861
So I got big so fast that I was able
to then start selling these guys,

1964
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:30,790
uh,

1965
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:34,060
three grams and then they
would go out and sell it.

1966
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:35,740
And I was just making like 50,

1967
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:38,320
$75 off every three grams
that I would sell them.

1968
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,180
And that started to be so much money
that I didn't even need to s ill 50s and

1969
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:43,501
hundreds.

1970
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:43,680
Right.

1971
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,513
So people just,

1972
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,420
they became,

1973
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,231
they became a,

1974
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:49,500
you were like the main dude
in everybody sold it for you.

1975
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,090
Right.

1976
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:50,490
Right.

1977
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,170
So then where did you keep everything?

1978
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,400
Did you have like a warehouse?

1979
00:47:53,401 --> 00:47:53,551
Like,

1980
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:54,300
how did you uh,

1981
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,370
have it set up so you could,

1982
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:55,731
well,

1983
00:47:55,731 --> 00:47:58,070
eventually what I did is I set up spots,

1984
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,100
like say for instance if you eventually,

1985
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:02,180
when I got real big,

1986
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,960
I have like $50 spots
and if you go to my spot,

1987
00:48:05,961 --> 00:48:06,411
him Smith,

1988
00:48:06,411 --> 00:48:11,120
$50 would be like going to somebody
else's spot and spend $100.

1989
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,550
You could do what they call double up.

1990
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,420
You could double your money.

1991
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,910
You buy $50 worth,

1992
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,420
you can make 50 more.

1993
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,800
Now if you would go there and you start
buying those 50s and you get up to

1994
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:26,801
spending 2000 then the people at that
house will take you to another house where

1995
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:31,640
you would have to come there and spend
2000 then if you got up to buy a 10,000

1996
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:36,500
then you would get to go to another house
and then we'd have a lot of these $50

1997
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:36,921
houses.

1998
00:48:36,921 --> 00:48:41,360
They would be just all over the place
and then it would just be a 50 to a few,

1999
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,670
$2,000 spots and then it will
be even less $10,000 spot.

2000
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,770
Do you know this is all for distributors,

2001
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:49,311
right?

2002
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:50,300
This is all for distributed.

2003
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,580
So you had like distributing houses.

2004
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:54,170
You had like a whole tier system,

2005
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:54,710
right?

2006
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,190
Absolutely.

2007
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,790
Brilliant.

2008
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:56,600
Absolutely.

2009
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,171
I didn't know,

2010
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:58,310
I didn't know exactly what,

2011
00:48:58,311 --> 00:48:58,611
you know,

2012
00:48:58,611 --> 00:48:58,910
what the,

2013
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,350
how they call it at the time,

2014
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,640
but I knew,

2015
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:02,591
see when I'd be in,

2016
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:06,380
as I dealt with people the way
I want it to be dealt with,

2017
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,480
I knew the problem that I
had when I was coming up,

2018
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,150
so I tried to cut out all
their problems for them.

2019
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,460
I didn't want them to have to
deal with none of the headaches,

2020
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,480
you know,

2021
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,490
not worrying about how to cook it,

2022
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:17,990
how to get it at,

2023
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:19,160
at a safe price,

2024
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,170
how to make sure that the place was safe.

2025
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:22,970
I took care of all that form.

2026
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,260
When they came to me,

2027
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,440
they knew they was going
to get their proper stuff.

2028
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,420
They knew they weren't going to be robbed,

2029
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,910
they knew how they would
be able to re up again.

2030
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,150
Everything was was like
cookie cutter form almost.

2031
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:36,163
Wow.

2032
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,313
That's amazing.

2033
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,570
So you're doing this for eight years,

2034
00:49:39,571 --> 00:49:41,190
you said from the beginning it was crazy.

2035
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:41,881
But when,

2036
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:44,280
when did you start getting legal problems?

2037
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:45,690
Yeah,

2038
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,410
my problem starting around 86.

2039
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:49,820
How many years in was that?

2040
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:51,111
Six years.

2041
00:49:51,111 --> 00:49:51,330
Six.

2042
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:55,310
Six w what was it they
started arresting you?

2043
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,750
They started asking me what
you're getting money you taskforce

2044
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,301
man.

2045
00:49:58,301 --> 00:50:00,880
They started to go crazy first day.

2046
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:01,090
Uh,

2047
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,960
they started to raised spots that
we didn't even sell drugs that,

2048
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:05,351
you know,

2049
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:10,351
he started writing my girlfriend's
houses and planting drugs on them.

2050
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:10,931
You know,

2051
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:13,450
cause I don't even keep drugs in my
girlfriend's house cause I stayed there,

2052
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,463
you know.

2053
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,810
But those were the easiest
spots to figure out.

2054
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,111
You know,

2055
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:19,620
where that we're connected to them.

2056
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,740
You know where people came over,

2057
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:23,530
cause they will let their friends
come over like my workspot.

2058
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,710
You didn't come to my workspot.

2059
00:50:24,711 --> 00:50:24,971
It listen,

2060
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:27,620
you sold drugs when no need
for you coming over there.

2061
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,670
Don't even,

2062
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,110
you know it only Max what asked that.

2063
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:30,740
Right.

2064
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,520
So they,

2065
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,760
they raided my girlfriend's houses and
then they would take them to jail for

2066
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:36,850
drugs and stuff like that there.

2067
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,281
So I'm like,

2068
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:38,114
wow.

2069
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,580
So then they started to getting my guys,

2070
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:41,061
you know,

2071
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:41,661
they started to catch,

2072
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:46,370
my guy's driving down the street and
they plant drugs on them and it just got

2073
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:50,390
really crazy until it got to a
point where one night I'm uh,

2074
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,310
coming from a basketball gym.

2075
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,480
I'm gonna Adjust your mic real quick.

2076
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,533
Okay.

2077
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:56,900
It makes a big difference.

2078
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,400
Yeah.

2079
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:58,661
All right.

2080
00:50:58,661 --> 00:50:59,000
Okay.

2081
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,390
There we go.

2082
00:50:59,390 --> 00:50:59,601
Yeah.

2083
00:50:59,601 --> 00:50:59,931
So,

2084
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:00,181
uh,

2085
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:01,730
I'm riding down the street one day and

2086
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,161
my,

2087
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,280
and my guys and we say,

2088
00:51:05,281 --> 00:51:05,720
man,

2089
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,550
look at all the homies
over there playing dice.

2090
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,120
So they was at my tire shop.

2091
00:51:09,121 --> 00:51:10,670
So we jump out and go buy Holler at him,

2092
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:10,881
you know,

2093
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:12,320
see who went into crap game.

2094
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,340
And when we get rid of the leave
the whole crap game come with me.

2095
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:16,710
You know,

2096
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:17,190
like it's,

2097
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:17,811
it's 10,

2098
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:18,650
11 o'clock at night.

2099
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:21,170
So they all want to walk me out to the
car and make sure everything is cause

2100
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:24,500
it's so I jumped in the car and pull off
and I look in the rear view mirror and

2101
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,330
it's a car following me with no lights on.

2102
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,870
So we are going to high speed chase,

2103
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,750
no chase for a few minutes.

2104
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:32,241
Do the hoods,

2105
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:32,901
trying to lose them.

2106
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:34,800
And then I look up cars
all around us coming.

2107
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:35,930
Pot Lights pop in on,

2108
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:37,041
you know what I'm saying?

2109
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:37,260
I'm like,

2110
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,093
Oh man,

2111
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,373
set up.

2112
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,901
So,

2113
00:51:39,901 --> 00:51:40,734
uh,

2114
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:42,980
I wound up getting out the car,

2115
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:43,650
jumping out the car,

2116
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,620
leave the car rolling and
jump out and get away.

2117
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:46,940
Well,

2118
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,780
they shooting at meat,

2119
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:48,501
police,

2120
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:48,801
Bam,

2121
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:49,041
Bam,

2122
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:49,281
Bam,

2123
00:51:49,281 --> 00:51:49,521
Bam,

2124
00:51:49,521 --> 00:51:50,354
Bam.

2125
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,420
But it's wisdom across my head and
the whole nine yards and I get away.

2126
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,650
So once I get away,

2127
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,211
the next morning,

2128
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:00,620
my lawyer called me and said,

2129
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:00,831
man,

2130
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:01,664
you had a,

2131
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,670
you have two kilos of
cocaine on you that night.

2132
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,331
I said,

2133
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:05,511
man,

2134
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:06,980
I ain't had no cocaine that night.

2135
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:07,851
He said,

2136
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:08,121
yeah,

2137
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:08,331
they,

2138
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:09,310
they uh,

2139
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,260
they said you had two keys of
cocaine and you shot at the police.

2140
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:13,221
So,

2141
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:14,054
uh,

2142
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,670
my mom called me,

2143
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,031
you know,

2144
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:17,670
she's crying.

2145
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,820
All the police been by
here and raided the house,

2146
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:22,380
had everybody outside handcuffed and sent,

2147
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,030
ain't gonna kill you.

2148
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,410
Why don't you turn yourself in?

2149
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,500
So her and my lawyer who convinced
me to turn myself in and we go in,

2150
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,020
we fight the case.

2151
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:31,450
I want a beaten it though,

2152
00:52:31,451 --> 00:52:32,810
because the dogs all planet,

2153
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,640
you know how to approve the drug supplier,

2154
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,441
man.

2155
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:36,760
It was,

2156
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,550
it was hard.

2157
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,301
You know what I'm saying?

2158
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:38,391
I,

2159
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:39,830
I stayed in jail for a while,

2160
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,341
no bail.

2161
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:41,720
They had me on $1 million bail,

2162
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:46,430
1251 where all the property and everything
had to be inspected and make sure it

2163
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:47,970
wasn't drug proceeds and,

2164
00:52:47,971 --> 00:52:48,741
and all that.

2165
00:52:48,741 --> 00:52:48,981
Man.

2166
00:52:48,981 --> 00:52:50,540
It was crazy going through all that.

2167
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:51,471
But,

2168
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:52,304
um,

2169
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,390
while I was in jail,

2170
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:56,840
the cops come down to my
sale to interrogate me.

2171
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,040
So they pulled me out the cell,

2172
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:02,540
take me to the back of the jail.

2173
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:02,811
You know,

2174
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:03,030
what they,

2175
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,400
what people were up in and stuff.

2176
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,110
And I'm starting asking me a bunch of
crazy questions about drugs and all this,

2177
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:11,570
and by my lawyer,

2178
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:12,404
you know,

2179
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,120
jewelry should have let you take the deal.

2180
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,860
Who Know why he thinks are
going to fight this case.

2181
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:16,700
You ain't going to win.

2182
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,900
We always get our man.

2183
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,200
So during this time that
they interviewed me,

2184
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:24,330
they recording everything
and at the end of the,

2185
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,800
the interrogation,

2186
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:26,311
they told me,

2187
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:29,250
you better not tell your lawyer what
happened if we find out that you told him

2188
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,371
we're going to,

2189
00:53:30,371 --> 00:53:31,204
uh,

2190
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,340
we're going to take care of you.

2191
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,190
So I don't even tell my lawyer.

2192
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:36,510
So we get to court.

2193
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,120
The next time we go to court in a,

2194
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,700
they got the guy on the witness stand,

2195
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,670
he's testifying.

2196
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:42,601
I said,

2197
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:42,751
man,

2198
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:42,931
you know,

2199
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,670
that guy came down and
see me like two weeks

2200
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,523
to go.

2201
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,410
And so he thinking that I ain't
doing to tell my lawyer never.

2202
00:53:50,411 --> 00:53:51,244
Right.

2203
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,110
So my lawyer springing on him like,

2204
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:53,261
man,

2205
00:53:53,261 --> 00:53:54,970
you was at the county jail
a couple of weeks ago.

2206
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,473
He was like,

2207
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:57,430
yeah,

2208
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:58,540
cause you know he signed in.

2209
00:53:58,541 --> 00:53:59,530
So he knew he had to say,

2210
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:00,340
yeah.

2211
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:00,611
He said,

2212
00:54:00,611 --> 00:54:01,510
you saw my client?

2213
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:02,471
He's like,

2214
00:54:02,471 --> 00:54:02,591
yeah.

2215
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:02,861
He said,

2216
00:54:02,861 --> 00:54:04,110
you knew he had a lawyer then you need,

2217
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:04,421
he's like,

2218
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:04,661
yeah,

2219
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,790
I knew he had a lawyer and then
want you to be calling all the,

2220
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,160
all the conversations when a,

2221
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,790
when you interview suspects.

2222
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,391
He said,

2223
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:10,601
yeah,

2224
00:54:10,601 --> 00:54:11,260
I want that tape.

2225
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:11,491
He said,

2226
00:54:11,491 --> 00:54:11,740
young,

2227
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,573
I want that tape.

2228
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,421
So they parked,

2229
00:54:13,421 --> 00:54:17,770
bought the tape in the tape was all
spiced up and cut up and he raised and all

2230
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:18,604
kinds of stuff.

2231
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:19,750
So the judge was like,

2232
00:54:19,751 --> 00:54:19,931
man,

2233
00:54:19,931 --> 00:54:20,950
get this case out of here.

2234
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,083
Really?

2235
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,640
But what they did is they took it to
the feds and had the feds to indict me

2236
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:29,840
without the tape,

2237
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:30,231
you know,

2238
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:30,970
like that.

2239
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:31,700
And also take,

2240
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:31,911
you know,

2241
00:54:31,911 --> 00:54:33,320
they never told the feds about the tape.

2242
00:54:33,321 --> 00:54:34,154
So the tape.

2243
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,920
So the feds indict me for that case,

2244
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:38,990
but then when they do,

2245
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:43,460
I had hired a private investigator to
invest the cops then investigate the

2246
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:44,294
couch.

2247
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,861
Then we show them,

2248
00:54:45,861 --> 00:54:46,161
hey look,

2249
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:48,890
when we got on them and you see you guys
don't want to use them as witnesses.

2250
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,143
Awesome.

2251
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,130
What'd you get on them?

2252
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:53,311
Oh man,

2253
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:55,470
we had him beaten people planting drugs.

2254
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,490
150 people got released from prison
behind those cops doing what they did

2255
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,410
with a lot of people don't realize is
how deep corruption is and some police

2256
00:55:03,411 --> 00:55:03,771
forces,

2257
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:05,110
especially in Los Angeles,

2258
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,080
a certain point in time,

2259
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,060
especially like the Rampart district,

2260
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:12,530
like people don't even know the story
behind that was a criminal gang.

2261
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,393
Now

2262
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:16,760
part was a a fall off from
the freeway task force.

2263
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,660
Really?

2264
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,290
Yeah.

2265
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:21,200
Freeway task force was the
beginning of that whole thing.

2266
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,410
The freeway task force was
the most elite task force in,

2267
00:55:24,411 --> 00:55:24,651
in,

2268
00:55:24,651 --> 00:55:25,280
in the country.

2269
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,080
Just to get you just to give it.

2270
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,593
Wow.

2271
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:29,583
I feel fortunate.

2272
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:31,831
I mean,

2273
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:33,310
what's crazy means you're out now,

2274
00:55:33,311 --> 00:55:35,800
is it feel weird to be how
many guys on the story?

2275
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,600
How many guys get their own task force?

2276
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,570
They're very few.

2277
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,030
It was like one in a billion.

2278
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,620
You get you a little wrapper puppet,

2279
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:42,483
you know

2280
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,340
he got a freeway task force,

2281
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:46,930
rapper,

2282
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:47,763
puppet.

2283
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,810
You lived a fucking charm life.

2284
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:53,950
You still $600 million with a coke yet
out on the street and now might be fun to

2285
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:54,784
get a jet.

2286
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,103
Wow.

2287
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:58,060
You might get a judge.

2288
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:58,570
Yeah.

2289
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,430
What do you mean in this case?

2290
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:00,701
You know,

2291
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:01,690
this judge might,

2292
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,710
I don't know which case
there's Rick Ross case.

2293
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,360
Yeah.

2294
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:06,620
You,

2295
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,230
you think the judge is corrupt?

2296
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,253
I don't know.

2297
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,860
Are you investigating this judge?

2298
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,481
I am.

2299
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:13,314
Yeah.

2300
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:14,491
Yeah.

2301
00:56:14,491 --> 00:56:15,324
I think you should.

2302
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,650
I want to know how she came
to a conclusion as you know,

2303
00:56:17,651 --> 00:56:18,100
why?

2304
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,880
Why did you,

2305
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,420
yeah,

2306
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,770
those are ridiculous conclusions.

2307
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,431
Exactly.

2308
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:22,680
So I want to get to the bottom of,

2309
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,040
I'm going get to the bottom of it,

2310
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,850
you know,

2311
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,100
anything that we can talk about it.

2312
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:27,550
Right.

2313
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,780
And she a Freemason little bit.

2314
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:29,500
A little bit.

2315
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,333
You know,

2316
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,420
he ain't no free mason,

2317
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:32,311
you know,

2318
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:33,470
free mason donation.

2319
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:34,840
She means the judge.

2320
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:35,310
Yeah.

2321
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:35,940
Day.

2322
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,773
He's not either,

2323
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,360
supposedly wasn't supposed
to be a Freezeman rapper.

2324
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:40,860
Yeah.

2325
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,040
Rick was supposed to be a free man.

2326
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,300
He said that before,

2327
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:44,030
but you don't call him.

2328
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,070
What the fuck is his name again?

2329
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,790
Uh,

2330
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:46,541
Billy Bob.

2331
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,490
It's called fat bill.

2332
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,640
So fat bill is supposed
to be a Freemason too.

2333
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:52,421
I don't know.

2334
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:54,610
He said it on a couple of
songs or something like that.

2335
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:55,540
Wow.

2336
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,110
Okay.

2337
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:58,000
But I know the masons are
not really happy with it.

2338
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,373
Oh really?

2339
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,100
That's hilarious.

2340
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:00,970
They contacted me.

2341
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:02,290
They're not happy with that at all.

2342
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:03,340
Wow.

2343
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,330
So you,

2344
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:05,180
you get arrested.

2345
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,310
So eventually,

2346
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:06,850
how do you,

2347
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,710
how do you wind up getting taken down?

2348
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,390
You got through all this,

2349
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,110
you got to this one case where they
tried to plant two kilos on you were Mo,

2350
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,590
most supplier Danilo blend.

2351
00:57:15,591 --> 00:57:16,424
Dawn,

2352
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,220
he brings me down.

2353
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,350
He bring me down your
supplier probably down.

2354
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:21,820
This was the Nicaraguan guy.

2355
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,080
He brought me down.

2356
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,950
He gave you up,

2357
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:24,783
gave me up

2358
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,690
and this is never heard me.

2359
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:29,643
Oh,

2360
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,530
and this is while the Oliver North Shit,

2361
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:33,610
all that was going down.

2362
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,421
It was just before that.

2363
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:35,400
I think it was after that.

2364
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:36,310
That was after all.

2365
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:37,030
He had gotten his,

2366
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,810
pardon?

2367
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:42,130
I need a part until anybody out there
know Obama and tell him I'm looking for,

2368
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:43,750
I did my part.

2369
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,060
I mean why should I get
a library like Reagan?

2370
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:50,200
Hilarious and so true too.

2371
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:50,800
Right?

2372
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,360
If you really find out if you,

2373
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,070
I mean people think that this is nonsense.

2374
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:54,311
You know,

2375
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:54,511
the,

2376
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:54,641
the,

2377
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:57,910
the connection between the CIA and
selling drugs has been pretty well

2378
00:57:57,911 --> 00:57:58,744
documented.

2379
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,810
Go look up a case on a
guy named Barry seal.

2380
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,850
Barry CEO was a guy out of MENA,

2381
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:04,930
Arkansas who was,

2382
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:05,764
by the way,

2383
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,290
there's Bill Clinton's
fucking stomping grounds.

2384
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,000
That's where they were dropping coke.

2385
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:13,600
They were flying cocaine from South
America and they were dropping it off in

2386
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:13,841
Mena,

2387
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:14,674
Arkansas.

2388
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,860
And the story goes to kids see the drop,

2389
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,341
uh,

2390
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:22,510
they catch the kids and kill them and
then they put the kids on the train tracks

2391
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:26,050
and say that the kids fell asleep on
train tracks and they were high and they

2392
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:27,670
fell asleep and they
got run over by trains.

2393
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:30,970
So the parents do an autopsy on the
bodies and they find Kneifel loans.

2394
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,540
Wow.

2395
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,231
So they find out,

2396
00:58:32,231 --> 00:58:32,441
no,

2397
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:32,591
no.

2398
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:33,640
These kids were murdered.

2399
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,531
That go into the story.

2400
00:58:34,531 --> 00:58:38,200
It turns out Barry seal's gets busted
because it was his plane that was coming

2401
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:39,130
in at that time.

2402
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,340
And then they find out about the coke
and he gives up all the information they

2403
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:44,680
want up assassinating him when
he was on his way to trial.

2404
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:44,961
Well,

2405
00:58:44,961 --> 00:58:45,230
man,

2406
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,420
Gary Webb killed himself,

2407
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:47,630
shot himself in the head twice,

2408
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,190
twice with a shotgun.

2409
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,960
So was it a shotgun?

2410
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:51,950
He shot himself in the head twice.

2411
00:58:51,951 --> 00:58:52,120
Well,

2412
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,290
thanks.

2413
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,740
So I am sorry to reports,

2414
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,501
but I think this would,

2415
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:56,180
somebody said it was a shot gun.

2416
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:56,930
Wow.

2417
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:57,700
Yeah.

2418
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,970
Shoot yourself in the head twice.

2419
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,500
It seems like that's what I didn't do.

2420
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:03,500
The job you had a job to do
and you didn't finish it.

2421
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,180
So it doesn't seem to make sense to me.

2422
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,020
Take care of it.

2423
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,240
I've heard it's possible to
shoot yourself in the head twice,

2424
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:08,571
but you know,

2425
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:11,000
that's also the dude who was
the whistle blower for Enron.

2426
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,860
Shot himself in the head twice.

2427
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:13,600
Oh yeah.

2428
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:13,990
Yeah.

2429
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,110
And then not too suspicious.

2430
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:15,271
Right,

2431
00:59:15,271 --> 00:59:15,390
right.

2432
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:19,590
This gigantic multibillionaire scam goes
down one motherfucker starts ratting

2433
00:59:19,591 --> 00:59:23,900
people out and winds up shooting
in a car twice in the head.

2434
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:24,800
Wow.

2435
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,460
Really?

2436
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,220
How many people have committed
suicide by gunshot to the head?

2437
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:29,054
Twice.

2438
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:29,361
I mean,

2439
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:33,260
I've seen people get knocked out with
like a little bitty punch and you tell me

2440
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:37,010
you shoot it yourself and you're
awake after they had good willpower.

2441
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,370
Yeah.

2442
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:37,860
Yes.

2443
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,230
Makes you the job was done well.

2444
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:41,180
I guess if you had any strength left,

2445
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:43,640
if you shot yourself in the head and
you realize you were still alive,

2446
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:44,690
you had any strength left,

2447
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:46,150
you would probably shoot yourself a car.

2448
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:47,300
You know,

2449
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:47,631
he'd be like,

2450
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:48,141
what the fuck?

2451
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:50,720
I'm going to just bleed
out here in the car,

2452
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:51,081
man.

2453
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:52,520
This Americans buy anything.

2454
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,200
Yeah.

2455
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,060
So you do you think
Gary Webb was murdered?

2456
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:56,990
I mean his book,

2457
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:57,824
dark alliance.

2458
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:02,390
Essentially what happened is it started
out a bunch of articles written for the

2459
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,030
San Jose Mercury News and it was later
published as a book and the three part

2460
01:00:05,031 --> 01:00:07,430
series he investigated
the Nicaraguan linked,

2461
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:08,210
uh,

2462
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:12,440
to the CIA back contrast who had allegedly
slipped and it's like he exposed the

2463
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:16,460
whole thing and brought the Reagan
administration and delight and expose them

2464
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,290
for essentially being drug dealers.

2465
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,243
Absolutely.

2466
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,840
Gary was amazing man.

2467
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:21,171
I mean,

2468
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:21,500
you know,

2469
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,380
he's the one who stopped
the forfeiture laws,

2470
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:24,771
you know,

2471
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:29,120
that you said would take your property
before you were found guilty of a drug

2472
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:29,480
crime.

2473
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,970
And Gary made them stop that and saying,

2474
01:00:30,971 --> 01:00:31,161
hey,

2475
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:34,280
at least you got to take this guy to
try and find out he was selling drugs

2476
01:00:34,281 --> 01:00:35,390
before you take his property.

2477
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:35,820
Well,

2478
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,160
that's before they would
take your property,

2479
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:37,541
sell it,

2480
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:39,680
and then you get kicked out of prison.

2481
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,790
You never got convicted.

2482
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:41,330
And they'd be like,

2483
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:41,481
Oh,

2484
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:42,470
well your car is gone.

2485
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:42,931
Well,

2486
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:43,740
what's hilarious?

2487
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:43,980
Yeah.

2488
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,750
What's hilarious is if you look at,

2489
01:00:45,751 --> 01:00:46,020
uh,

2490
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,180
how the Patriot Act has been used,

2491
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,450
you know how many times the Patriot Act
has actually been used for terrorism.

2492
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,530
It's a tiny,

2493
01:00:52,531 --> 01:00:53,280
tiny,

2494
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,280
tiny fraction because the Patriot Act
classifies drug selling as terrorism.

2495
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,720
So the Patriot Act has been used for
drug selling thousands of times and it's

2496
01:01:03,721 --> 01:01:05,400
been used for terrorism,

2497
01:01:05,401 --> 01:01:06,960
like a small handful.

2498
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:07,390
It's,

2499
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:08,280
it's kind of cute.

2500
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,151
It's kind of cute.

2501
01:01:09,151 --> 01:01:11,370
Have they've figured out how
to circumvent the system?

2502
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,181
Absolutely.

2503
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:12,500
I mean,

2504
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,680
it's crazy the way.

2505
01:01:13,681 --> 01:01:14,020
Uh,

2506
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:14,853
um,

2507
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,900
I saw a thing on CNN the other night and
they were talking about how California

2508
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:23,901
has built so many prisons and absolutely
no colleges in the past 10 years.

2509
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:26,304
And I'm like,

2510
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:30,720
I mean this is what happened
to an ounce of prevention.

2511
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:31,501
You know,

2512
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:33,840
we're going with pounds and tons of cure,

2513
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,460
but no prevention.

2514
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,810
Well the worst thing that ever happened,

2515
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,980
that could be possible.

2516
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,540
They made private presence.

2517
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,850
They made it profitable for
people to put people in jail,

2518
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,770
which is fucking insane.

2519
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:44,381
The fact,

2520
01:01:44,381 --> 01:01:44,941
I mean that is,

2521
01:01:44,941 --> 01:01:46,800
that's some Orwellian Shit.

2522
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:47,311
That's some,

2523
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:51,180
that's some shit that should have been
taking place is slavery is slavery.

2524
01:01:51,181 --> 01:01:52,260
It's 100% slavery.

2525
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,830
Especially when you
have certain government
organizations that lobby to keep

2526
01:01:55,831 --> 01:01:58,160
certain things illegal like drug selling,

2527
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,370
like nonviolent crimes,

2528
01:01:59,371 --> 01:02:00,720
like nonviolent drug offenses.

2529
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:01,410
When you're,

2530
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:04,380
you're telling someone that they don't
have control over their own consciousness

2531
01:02:04,381 --> 01:02:08,250
and because they don't agree with
you as to what they can and can't do,

2532
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,130
you're going to lock them in
a cage and profit from it.

2533
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,300
That's amazing.

2534
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:17,360
It's a great business that
somebody fucking amazing
though that in 2012 with are

2535
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,100
all the access to information
we have today that

2536
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,840
that's still a legal thing.

2537
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,111
I mean,

2538
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:26,450
it's just another piece of perfect advice
or are perfect information rather than

2539
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:26,691
shows,

2540
01:02:26,691 --> 01:02:28,320
shows you how corrupt the system is.

2541
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:29,881
Yeah,

2542
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:30,131
it's,

2543
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:30,461
it's,

2544
01:02:30,461 --> 01:02:30,740
it's,

2545
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,590
it's incredible.

2546
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,170
It's incredible when you really stop
and think about how many prisoners are,

2547
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:37,080
are good that we got people like
you to bring this stuff to light.

2548
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:37,741
I mean,

2549
01:02:37,741 --> 01:02:38,740
I don't see why more,

2550
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,380
more people don't stand up.

2551
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:40,831
You know what,

2552
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:42,580
I guess people saw what happened
to Gary and you're like,

2553
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,423
Shit.

2554
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:43,801
Yeah,

2555
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:44,071
right.

2556
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:44,670
Me,

2557
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:49,080
me go out there and put my job on the
line and my family wellbeing I to expose

2558
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:50,560

2559
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:50,760

2560
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,080
I come in like third,

2561
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,191
fourth,

2562
01:02:53,191 --> 01:02:53,461
fifth,

2563
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:54,120
sixth.

2564
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,130
I'm not the number one
guy breaking the news.

2565
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:57,480
So you make sure he's safe.

2566
01:02:57,481 --> 01:02:58,920
Shit's already clear.

2567
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,060
It's already on the Internet.

2568
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,530
By the time I hear about it,

2569
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,210
I'm like a third hand reporter.

2570
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,250
Somebody finds it on the Internet.

2571
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:06,120
They tweet me.

2572
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:07,110
I find out about,

2573
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:08,103
I go with it.

2574
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:08,991
But,

2575
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:09,180
uh,

2576
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,450
I actually found out about you
through Kevin boost documentary.

2577
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:13,140
Um,

2578
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:13,441

2580
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:14,470
the great white hope,

2581
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:15,360
American drug war.

2582
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,560
Kevin's a good guy.

2583
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:17,011
Kevin.

2584
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:17,540
Uh,

2585
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,100
you know,

2586
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,770
kept an eye on me when I was in prison,

2587
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:20,550
you know,

2588
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:21,383
wrote me,

2589
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,471
I could call Kevin.

2590
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:23,990
He interviewed you from prison as well?

2591
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:24,691
He did.

2592
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:25,051
He did.

2593
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:25,920
When I met with Kevin,

2594
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:28,170
Kevin made my life a little
easier while I was in prison.

2595
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,063
You know,

2596
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,420
shout out to Kevin Booth.

2597
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,520
Kevin produced my first DVD.

2598
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:33,371
Oh,

2599
01:03:33,371 --> 01:03:34,470
Daddy's comedy DVD.

2600
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,291
I sent the book,

2601
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:38,380
I read the book that uh,

2602
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:38,830
he,

2603
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:40,240
he his buddy road.

2604
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:41,423
Bill Hicks.

2605
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,020
Yeah.

2606
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:42,853
Yeah.

2607
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,470
Kevin's a good guy though.

2608
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:45,181
Yeah,

2609
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:45,511
he,

2610
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:45,960
uh,

2611
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,650
he became mean who he is because
of his friendship with Bill Hicks.

2612
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:49,831
You know,

2613
01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:53,970
he used to follow Bill Hicks around and
record them and Bill Hicks as far as

2614
01:03:53,971 --> 01:03:55,200
standup comedians are concerned,

2615
01:03:55,201 --> 01:03:58,530
like one of the top 10 greatest
comedians of all time for sure.

2616
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,190
You know,

2617
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:01,170
right up there with a lot of
people like Richard Pryor.

2618
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:01,800
Right.

2619
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,430
Even though he didn't live very long died
of pancreatic cancer when he's only in

2620
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:06,540
his young thirties,

2621
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,210
you know.

2622
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:07,501
But,

2623
01:04:07,501 --> 01:04:08,250
um,

2624
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,450
so he creates this,

2625
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:10,261
this documentary,

2626
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:11,130
the American drug war.

2627
01:04:11,131 --> 01:04:11,431
And that's,

2628
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:12,630
that's how I heard about you.

2629
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:12,900
And,

2630
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:13,850
and that's how I heard about,

2631
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:14,430
cause I had already,

2632
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:19,430
I had already heard about Barry seals and
Barry seal and his connection with the

2633
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:20,940
CIA and selling drugs.

2634
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,600
But I didn't,

2635
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,600
I didn't know of any one person like you
who could be directly connected to the

2636
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:31,290
dude that was connected to Nicaragua that
was connected to Oliver North and the

2637
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,370
whole chain of events.

2638
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,121
Absolutely.

2639
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:33,781
Absolutely.

2640
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:34,351
I think when,

2641
01:04:34,351 --> 01:04:34,840
uh,

2642
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,160
window,

2643
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,930
when blend on testified against me,

2644
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:38,400
he talked about

2645
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:44,340
his balls to going on a fishing
ship with a George Bush senior.

2646
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,450
Wow.

2647
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:46,283
When the kid went,

2648
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,280
Barry seal was murdered,

2649
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:47,991
he had George Bush,

2650
01:04:47,991 --> 01:04:48,960
his phone number in his pocket

2651
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:54,000
as deep as it gets.

2652
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,010
Might've been a tracking
device in that phone number.

2653
01:04:56,011 --> 01:04:56,220
Yeah,

2654
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,053
I know where you at.

2655
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,270
And then meanwhile,

2656
01:04:58,271 --> 01:04:59,040
and meanwhile,

2657
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,510
no one goes to jail.

2658
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,150
No one on that side goes to jail.

2659
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:02,940
Nothing.

2660
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,840
No one goes to jail.

2661
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:04,674
I should day.

2662
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,300
It's amazing they make the laws,

2663
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,820
but how the fuck did
they let you out at work?

2664
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:09,330
Yeah.

2665
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:10,200
They only you,

2666
01:05:10,201 --> 01:05:11,340
you went in for 20 years.

2667
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,360
I had a life sentence,

2668
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:13,070
man.

2669
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,040
And how'd you get out early?

2670
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:17,980
Learning how to read and
write and the law and

2671
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,270
a loophole.

2672
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,193
What was the little fall?

2673
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:21,380
Well,

2674
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,680
what they did is they charged
me under the three strike law.

2675
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:24,790
And uh,

2676
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:28,660
what they were saying is that since I
had got convicted and all these different

2677
01:05:28,661 --> 01:05:29,494
states,

2678
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,290
that those added up to three strikes.

2679
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,340
But what they didn't see in the,

2680
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:39,190
in the law is that in
order to get struck out,

2681
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,540
you have to go to prison,

2682
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,213
get out,

2683
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,020
they commit another crime,

2684
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,263
go to prison,

2685
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,850
get out and then commit the third one.

2686
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:49,780
And that's three strikes.

2687
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:53,250
So we can't get you on three felonies
before you're ever convicted.

2688
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:54,933
Three strikes,

2689
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,240
three strikes if,

2690
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:56,600
if,

2691
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,090
if,

2692
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,530
if safe is,

2693
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,670
and what I use is,

2694
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:01,960
is a guy standing out when I
used to stand out on the street,

2695
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,590
I used to make hundreds of sales a
day right there on that one block.

2696
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,180
So I said no.

2697
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:09,760
If somebody wanted to,

2698
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:12,670
they could've gave me
a hundred convictions.

2699
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,900
Right?

2700
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,560
Cause I'm with different
people every time.

2701
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,520
So I didn't believe that the law meant
that every sale you may was a separate

2702
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:21,694
conviction.

2703
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:26,560
I believe that they meant just like
I just explained it because if so,

2704
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:28,420
then everybody who ever sold cocaine,

2705
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:28,830
what happened?

2706
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:31,950
Three strikes and it makes sense
because the idea is supposed to be

2707
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:35,490
theoretically that jail is supposed
to be able to really rehabilitate.

2708
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:35,670
Yeah,

2709
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:36,091
exactly.

2710
01:06:36,091 --> 01:06:38,890
So if you are unreliability table,

2711
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:41,910
if you've gone through two separate
times and you're still out doing the same

2712
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:42,330
shit,

2713
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:42,571
all right,

2714
01:06:42,571 --> 01:06:43,980
well this dude's a career criminal.

2715
01:06:43,981 --> 01:06:45,540
This is his third offense done.

2716
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:46,900
That makes sense.

2717
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,100
And that's how the law was rolled up.

2718
01:06:48,101 --> 01:06:50,560
Even though I don't believe you should
play baseball with people lives.

2719
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:51,640
Right.

2720
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,600
Because the person could not be changed
at one time and then be changed tomorrow

2721
01:06:55,601 --> 01:06:58,270
and then his circumstances changed
and he may be in a different position.

2722
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:58,660
Right.

2723
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:58,991
You know,

2724
01:06:58,991 --> 01:07:00,640
before you can start passing judgment,

2725
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,630
judgment on people,

2726
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:03,690
you have to live in their shoes and,

2727
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:04,571
and you know,

2728
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:05,770
that's why people ask me now,

2729
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,480
how do I feel about
drug dealers and other,

2730
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:08,590
I ain't got none.

2731
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:09,310
He him,

2732
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:10,120
right.

2733
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:10,571
They do.

2734
01:07:10,571 --> 01:07:13,120
What they feel like they got to do
or what they know they got to do.

2735
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:13,954
So,

2736
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,793
uh,

2737
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,100
before we pass judgment,

2738
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:20,110
we have to get all the facts and live in
that person's shoes to see if we would

2739
01:07:20,111 --> 01:07:21,220
do the same thing that they did.

2740
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:22,910
And you're a perfect example of that.

2741
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:23,893
Absolutely.

2742
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:24,750
Now you,

2743
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,400
you're away.

2744
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,690
You went away for 20 years,

2745
01:07:26,691 --> 01:07:27,800
you find this loophole.

2746
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:31,160
How deep into your sentence had you
had already figured out how to read?

2747
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:32,010
How

2748
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,960
I started reading immediately right away.

2749
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:34,900
Yeah.

2750
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,500
Take classes there and no,

2751
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:37,381
I taught my,

2752
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:37,981
me and my celly,

2753
01:07:37,981 --> 01:07:38,820
he taught me how to read.

2754
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:41,160
He made me some cue cards
to my ABC's on them,

2755
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,360
a call and went from,

2756
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:47,350
from nose to a reading my indictment
to reading the newspapers to uh,

2757
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,270
to read law books.

2758
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:48,661
I mean,

2759
01:07:48,661 --> 01:07:48,901
you know,

2760
01:07:48,901 --> 01:07:52,020
for the first time when I found out is
that I had never wanted to read before in

2761
01:07:52,021 --> 01:07:52,854
my life.

2762
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:54,270
That was the real problem.

2763
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:55,360
I never really wanted to read.

2764
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:56,581
I mean,

2765
01:07:56,581 --> 01:07:59,760
I didn't see any reason why Jack and
Jill went up the hill and why I should

2766
01:07:59,761 --> 01:08:00,220
know.

2767
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,053
Right.

2768
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,470
You know what I'm saying?

2769
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:07,390
They didn't have it when Jason,

2770
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:07,841
no money.

2771
01:08:07,841 --> 01:08:08,740
I was chasing money.

2772
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:09,151
Right,

2773
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:09,361
right,

2774
01:08:09,361 --> 01:08:10,110
right.

2775
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:10,411
It was,

2776
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:11,490
it wasn't interesting to you.

2777
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:12,690
It wasn't interesting to me.

2778
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,190
But then once you realize,

2779
01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:14,311
well,

2780
01:08:14,311 --> 01:08:16,370
there's a lot of that I don't have access

2781
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:16,970
to.

2782
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:18,980
I gotta I gotta I became an avid reader.

2783
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,080
I read over 300 books
before I left prison.

2784
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:21,800
Really?

2785
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,400
Yeah.

2786
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:22,820
Wow.

2787
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,710
You've read more books
than I have in my lifetime.

2788
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,520
Yeah.

2789
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,050
So you're in prison,

2790
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:27,591
you're,

2791
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:27,891
you're,

2792
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:28,724
you're learning how to read.

2793
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:33,740
At what point in time did
you start devising a plan
to try to like figure out a

2794
01:08:34,461 --> 01:08:35,330
way to get out of there?

2795
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:36,540
Well,

2796
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:37,940
immediately I was trying to get out,

2797
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:38,361
you know,

2798
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:42,620
I knew that the guys that
were going home was it guys.

2799
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:43,760
It was going to the library,

2800
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,990
learn how to become lawyers,

2801
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:45,741
you know,

2802
01:08:45,741 --> 01:08:49,100
they knew how to fight the system and
then they had like guys that all they did

2803
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:50,570
all day was sit down and study law.

2804
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:51,260
You know,

2805
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:55,460
they would sit at a table while the
people were playing cards and chest and

2806
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:56,294
Domino's.

2807
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:57,620
They will be studying the law.

2808
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:58,270
So I got,

2809
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,390
I got in with those guys.

2810
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,090
That's gotta be kind of a crazy feeling,

2811
01:09:01,091 --> 01:09:01,510
man.

2812
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:05,080
Everybody's just hoping you can crack
this fucking system that's got you locked

2813
01:09:05,081 --> 01:09:05,910
up.

2814
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:06,743
It's tough.

2815
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,380
Starts to hurt daily.

2816
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:09,741
You get,

2817
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:13,700
you got like migraine headaches and
you sitting in this concrete building,

2818
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:15,560
I'm going to try to
draw a picture for you.

2819
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,370
You sitting in this concrete
building is 28 stories high,

2820
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:20,923
um,

2821
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,730
nothing but concrete and steel.

2822
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:28,180
The windows are about three inches
wide open and about six feet long

2823
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:31,743
escape.

2824
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:34,740
It looks almost impossible when you know,

2825
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,800
you think about that too.

2826
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:37,510
Like if I had a long rope pocket scale,

2827
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:38,530
the side of the building,

2828
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:39,731
so,

2829
01:09:39,731 --> 01:09:40,564
uh,

2830
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,160
it's like a desperation,

2831
01:09:42,161 --> 01:09:42,551
you know,

2832
01:09:42,551 --> 01:09:42,950
and you saying,

2833
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:43,141
man,

2834
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:45,850
it gotta be one loophole in
his books because you know

2835
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,070
that if

2836
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,660
you can show them in the book where
they made a mistake or would a book says

2837
01:09:52,661 --> 01:09:54,760
that they should have did
this when they did that,

2838
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:55,661
then you know,

2839
01:09:55,661 --> 01:09:56,494
you got the action.

2840
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:57,561
So you're,

2841
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:57,721
you,

2842
01:09:57,721 --> 01:10:00,160
you get any headaches just from
thinking and reading too much.

2843
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:00,791
Yeah,

2844
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:01,810
that's all you want to do.

2845
01:10:01,811 --> 01:10:03,250
And you just want to stand them books.

2846
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:04,030
You know,

2847
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:05,080
I got a life sentence.

2848
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,411
You know,

2849
01:10:05,411 --> 01:10:06,370
when you've got a life sentence,

2850
01:10:06,371 --> 01:10:07,780
it's like this is forever.

2851
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:08,561
You know,

2852
01:10:08,561 --> 01:10:10,540
this is all you're going to
see for the rest of your life,

2853
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:10,991
you know?

2854
01:10:10,991 --> 01:10:11,824
So,

2855
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,713
um,

2856
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,560
I didn't think that was fitting for me.

2857
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:18,280
It's amazing that they convicted you
for life on that three strikes law.

2858
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:22,300
It seems like you should be able to
go after them for abusing the law,

2859
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,560
which should be criminal.

2860
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:23,831
Well,

2861
01:10:23,831 --> 01:10:24,311
you can't,

2862
01:10:24,311 --> 01:10:25,990
you can't go at the federal prosecutor.

2863
01:10:25,991 --> 01:10:26,824
He's immune.

2864
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:27,531
That's amazing.

2865
01:10:27,531 --> 01:10:27,820
From,

2866
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:28,150
from,

2867
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:30,630
from prosecution because he,

2868
01:10:30,631 --> 01:10:32,230
he's not working as an individual.

2869
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:33,970
Even if it's been proven
that he's corrupt.

2870
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:35,260
Well,

2871
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,700
maybe if you can pull he's,

2872
01:10:36,701 --> 01:10:37,500
he's corrupt,

2873
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,570
but not because he incompetent and justly.

2874
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:41,140
Yeah.

2875
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:41,860
In combination.

2876
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:42,693
In your case,

2877
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:43,061
you know,

2878
01:10:43,061 --> 01:10:44,170
if he does something to you,

2879
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:44,471
you know,

2880
01:10:44,471 --> 01:10:46,630
you could charge you with a thousand keys,

2881
01:10:46,631 --> 01:10:48,770
even though you only had one know.

2882
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,620
And if you've got a thousand keys,

2883
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:50,861
you know,

2884
01:10:50,861 --> 01:10:51,910
that gives you a life sentence.

2885
01:10:51,911 --> 01:10:52,744
If you got one,

2886
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:53,231
you know,

2887
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:54,160
you can get probation.

2888
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,870
But uh,

2889
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:56,763
if it's powder,

2890
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:58,320
that's it.

2891
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,610
That's a thing people don't know about.

2892
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:04,510
That's another good point because crack
was in the ghetto and powder was all

2893
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:04,970
these,

2894
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:05,560
you know,

2895
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,400
other people,

2896
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:09,460
these people that had money
were using the powder.

2897
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:11,830
Crack is way more illegal.

2898
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:12,813
Yeah.

2899
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:14,060
Honey bird tube one.

2900
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,993
Wow.

2901
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:16,260
That's incredible.

2902
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,720
That is,

2903
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,790
is that racist?

2904
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:18,870
Very racist.

2905
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:19,800
And it has to be right.

2906
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:20,670
And I think,

2907
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:21,181
I mean,

2908
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:23,250
and even though they
just change it 18 to one,

2909
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:24,510
I think that was still,

2910
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,610
why isn't it a one to one?

2911
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,950
And that's when I say it
because they already proved,

2912
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:29,401
you know,

2913
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:31,620
I sit down on the couch with
the guy who invented the law.

2914
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:32,790
Really?

2915
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:33,001
Yeah.

2916
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:34,890
It's going to be in the
document and Mi six,

2917
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:35,131
six,

2918
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:36,930
six documentary after you're out.

2919
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,800
You sat down with that.

2920
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:38,011
Yeah,

2921
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:39,300
I've been doing that since I've been out.

2922
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,610
I've been doing a documentary
since I've been out man.

2923
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,300
And,

2924
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:42,750
and,

2925
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:43,081
and,

2926
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:46,770
and one of the things that I got
mad about even with Obama and his

2927
01:11:46,771 --> 01:11:48,720
administration is that they
didn't make it one on one.

2928
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:53,160
And then even after they made an 1801
they left it for guys who have been in 20

2929
01:11:53,161 --> 01:11:53,431
years,

2930
01:11:53,431 --> 01:11:54,241
25 years,

2931
01:11:54,241 --> 01:11:55,470
they didn't make it retroactive.

2932
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,780
Meaning that they don't get out.

2933
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,240
They don't get no benefit
from the front of 18 to one.

2934
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:01,200
It's guys right now,

2935
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:01,591
if they,

2936
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:03,600
if they had the 18 to one,

2937
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:04,950
they will walk out of prison today.

2938
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:06,090
Wow.

2939
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:10,770
So I'm saying if it's wrong today and
you did it 20 years ago was wronged in,

2940
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:11,730
right.

2941
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:12,360
But they said,

2942
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:15,060
oh well there they lost their,

2943
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:15,690
uh,

2944
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:16,051
cause you know,

2945
01:12:16,051 --> 01:12:18,480
Clinton signed a bill where you're 2155,

2946
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:21,420
you've got one year after you convicted
to come up with newly discovered

2947
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:22,710
evidence and the law.

2948
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:23,580
It's crazy man.

2949
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,571
Like right now,

2950
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:25,180
say for instance,

2951
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:30,180
if you go to prison unjustly and you
do all your appeals and everything one

2952
01:12:31,171 --> 01:12:32,004
year,

2953
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:34,110
you have one year to
prove yourself innocent.

2954
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,730
Now after that one year,

2955
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:41,040
if you don't find it and then a day
after that one year you find this newly

2956
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:41,970
discovered evidence,

2957
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,470
you can't even submit it to the coach.

2958
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:46,140
Oh that's gotta be maddening.

2959
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,341
It's maddening.

2960
01:12:47,341 --> 01:12:48,460
They got guys in there that,

2961
01:12:48,461 --> 01:12:48,661
that,

2962
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:52,680
that found newly discovered evidence that
they can't even submit it for anybody

2963
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:53,514
to hear it.

2964
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:56,860
So when you went to jail for this
and when you're finally in prison,

2965
01:12:56,861 --> 01:12:57,150
was there,

2966
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:57,280
there,

2967
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,310
was this the first time you'd ever been
in prison other than the one time you

2968
01:13:00,311 --> 01:13:02,380
got arrested and you
stayed in there for awhile?

2969
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:02,841
No,

2970
01:13:02,841 --> 01:13:03,210
no,

2971
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:03,360
I,

2972
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,300
that was my second time when
I got the life sentence.

2973
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:06,290
I've been to jail twice.

2974
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:07,770
So you had two strikes,

2975
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:08,400
you had one,

2976
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,130
Stryker.

2977
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:09,430
Stryker,

2978
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:09,600
right.

2979
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,100
How long did you go
away for the first time?

2980
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:12,340
Five and a half years.

2981
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,593
Wow.

2982
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,710
So you were in the second time?

2983
01:13:14,711 --> 01:13:15,580
I was in trapped.

2984
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:18,880
I didn't even go into that point when
I was in trap cause I wasn't selling

2985
01:13:18,881 --> 01:13:19,714
drugs.

2986
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,840
I was building a youth center because
when I did is I figured out what kids in

2987
01:13:25,811 --> 01:13:28,810
the ghetto need to get them
out of gangs and drugs.

2988
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,040
I know what they need.

2989
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:32,170
So when I did is I bought a new,

2990
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:33,260
I'm born at the aid,

2991
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:33,911
they need some,

2992
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:34,121
some,

2993
01:13:34,121 --> 01:13:35,020
some instructions.

2994
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:37,250
They need somebody to come and,

2995
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:37,630
and,

2996
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,680
and walk them through it.

2997
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,800
Somebody they can go and talk to
when they need to talk to him,

2998
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,341
you know,

2999
01:13:42,341 --> 01:13:46,480
not talk to him once they already been
corrupted and there he is already in the

3000
01:13:46,481 --> 01:13:46,721
game.

3001
01:13:46,721 --> 01:13:47,740
They don't want to hear you then,

3002
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:48,101
you know,

3003
01:13:48,101 --> 01:13:49,240
I already got my mind made up.

3004
01:13:49,241 --> 01:13:49,931
I know what I'm doing.

3005
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:50,770
I'm my own man.

3006
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:52,870
But before they get like that,

3007
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,130
they need somebody,

3008
01:13:54,131 --> 01:13:56,220
a place that they can go and,

3009
01:13:56,221 --> 01:14:01,221
and they could talk to Joe Rogan or Rick
Ross or magic Johnson or Oprah Winfrey

3010
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,080
or some of these other people who could
teach them how to make money other ways,

3011
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:07,631
you know,

3012
01:14:07,631 --> 01:14:08,051
because in,

3013
01:14:08,051 --> 01:14:08,621
in the ghetto,

3014
01:14:08,621 --> 01:14:08,861
you know,

3015
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,240
the first business you see in the ghetto,

3016
01:14:10,241 --> 01:14:12,220
you know the first is what

3017
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,173
the drug man,

3018
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,780
he's going to be the first
businessman that you see in,

3019
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:20,680
in south central Los Angeles is going to
be the drug man and especially a black

3020
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:22,840
man as a business owner because we don't,

3021
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:23,201
we don't,

3022
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:24,190
nothing in south central.

3023
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,360
So you,

3024
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,460
when you got,

3025
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,050
so you said you got set up.

3026
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:30,520
This is the last time.

3027
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:31,181
Yeah.

3028
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:31,421
Yeah.

3029
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:32,440
When I got the life sentence,

3030
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:33,430
this guy called me.

3031
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:34,710
I'm not selling drugs.

3032
01:14:34,711 --> 01:14:35,970
He was selling drugs or on him.

3033
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:36,670
I had,

3034
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,820
I hadn't sold drugs and six years,

3035
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:40,654
seven years.

3036
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,290
Wow.

3037
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,220
How did you stop?

3038
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:43,563
I just quit.

3039
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,070
Did you quit after you got arrested?

3040
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:47,770
The first time in the five years I
quit a year and a half before I went to

3041
01:14:47,771 --> 01:14:48,220
prison.

3042
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:48,701
I was like,

3043
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:49,300
man,

3044
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:49,961
I'm through with this.

3045
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:50,600
I got,

3046
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,850
I've got eight $900,000 cash.

3047
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:56,990
I've got property all over the place and
I got to do now is make this property

3048
01:14:56,991 --> 01:15:00,410
and stuff work for me and you know I've
got enough money to hold me off for

3049
01:15:00,411 --> 01:15:01,244
awhile.

3050
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,473
I'm through with it.

3051
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,830
So I walked away from the game.

3052
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,490
So I'm confused as on your timeline
here because when you were 20 years old,

3053
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,760
that's when you started and then
when you were 28 you got arrested.

3054
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:12,330
Right?

3055
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:13,860
But you did five years in jail,

3056
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,300
right?

3057
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,320
Where's the five years?

3058
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:20,250
I did the five years
in 89 I went to prison.

3059
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,113
How old were you then?

3060
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,700
28 28 and a half.

3061
01:15:23,701 --> 01:15:24,540
28 and a half.

3062
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:27,460
You go to jail for five years
and then you get out for,

3063
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,180
I got out,

3064
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:31,050
I got off for six months for six
months and then they give you the life

3065
01:15:31,051 --> 01:15:31,471
sentence,

3066
01:15:31,471 --> 01:15:32,190
right?

3067
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,023
Whoa,

3068
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,073
God damn.

3069
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:35,890
So the life sentences,

3070
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:36,810
a total setup.

3071
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,840
Total setup to trap me,

3072
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:39,713
total entrapment.

3073
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,850
I was not selling drugs
and then they'll call me.

3074
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,120
And a matter of fact called
me the day I got a prison.

3075
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,500
Whoa.

3076
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,190
He was like,

3077
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:47,431
man,

3078
01:15:47,431 --> 01:15:48,200
I need to see you

3079
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:48,351
like,

3080
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,531
man,

3081
01:15:48,531 --> 01:15:49,550
I'm kicking it with my mom.

3082
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,060
You know,

3083
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,730
my mom came and see me
and stuff like that.

3084
01:15:52,731 --> 01:15:53,930
So I'm not going to
kicking it with my mom.

3085
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:54,740
I'm cool.

3086
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,850
I hydrogen a couple of days.

3087
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:58,700
So when I finally going to
highlight and he's telling me,

3088
01:15:58,701 --> 01:15:59,031
Oh man,

3089
01:15:59,031 --> 01:16:01,070
I got it at this price
and kind of at that price,

3090
01:16:01,071 --> 01:16:01,410
I was like,

3091
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:01,940
what?

3092
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:02,480
That's a good one.

3093
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,313
Right?

3094
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,810
And all this is recorded too.

3095
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:08,520
So that didn't help.

3096
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,000
You know,

3097
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,450
they was like,

3098
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:09,681
oh,

3099
01:16:09,681 --> 01:16:10,710
well you were interested.

3100
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:11,640
Wow.

3101
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,001
So,

3102
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:12,834
uh,

3103
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,240
this went on for six
months that he courted me,

3104
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:15,860
you know,

3105
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:16,501
calling me,

3106
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:17,400
dropping the price,

3107
01:16:17,401 --> 01:16:18,780
driving a motherfucker.

3108
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:19,710
And then

3109
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:22,080
one day he caught me and I was
riding with one of my little homies,

3110
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:24,810
Chico Brown.

3111
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,001
I said,

3112
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:27,301
man,

3113
01:16:27,301 --> 01:16:28,380
this dude just told me,

3114
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:29,630
whoo.

3115
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:30,121
When she goes,

3116
01:16:30,121 --> 01:16:30,541
look man,

3117
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:31,500
I can sell all that

3118
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,050
then that,

3119
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,100
that's how I got started.

3120
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,590
So I wind up making an
introduction to the two of them.

3121
01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:41,370
Chico hand in the money and the
police come from everywhere.

3122
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:43,460
So you'd never even got to sell?

3123
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:43,911
No,

3124
01:16:43,911 --> 01:16:44,744
I never sold it.

3125
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,890
So this guy,

3126
01:16:45,891 --> 01:16:46,730
where is he now?

3127
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,593
Danilo.

3128
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:48,441
Uh,

3129
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:49,310
he's in Nicaragua.

3130
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:50,450
Just chilling.

3131
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:54,130
He's supposed to be in the
documentary to really yell.

3132
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,850
Y'all better check that documentary out.

3133
01:16:55,851 --> 01:16:57,040
It's going to be awesome.

3134
01:16:57,890 --> 01:16:59,590
Now this Danilo him.

3135
01:16:59,591 --> 01:17:01,040
We don't have to cop that plan,

3136
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:01,330
didn't you?

3137
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:01,970
Hugs.

3138
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,080
Whoa.

3139
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:04,120
It's,

3140
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,750
do you have proof that
he planted the drugs?

3141
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:07,480
I know he plans a drunk.

3142
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:08,550
Does he?

3143
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:09,290
He went to,

3144
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:09,471
no,

3145
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:10,090
I don't think he's

3146
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:11,030
to mini plans to drove,

3147
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:12,020
but he went to jail for it.

3148
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:15,200
He went to jail for planting
those drugs for corruption.

3149
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:15,501
You know,

3150
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,390
beaten people plan dre.

3151
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:17,931
He was doing,

3152
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:19,850
I don't police it was a habit.

3153
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,041
I mean he made money,

3154
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:22,874
man.

3155
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:23,320
Yeah,

3156
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,790
well that's where the rampart comes in.

3157
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:25,780
I mean for people don't know.

3158
01:17:25,781 --> 01:17:26,230
Most.

3159
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:31,230
Most police officers at this point in
time believe that should night hired cops

3160
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,000
to kill biggie smalls and that,

3161
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:34,540
um,

3162
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:35,500
they also,

3163
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:40,530
he probably also had Tupac killed
and that he did it all under this,

3164
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,160
under this rampart division.

3165
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,110
It's rampart division was working for him.

3166
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,600
I mean there's a huge rolling
stone article about it.

3167
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,800
It's fascinating,

3168
01:17:47,801 --> 01:17:52,801
fascinating shit that the cops were so
dirty that the cops were working with

3169
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:53,830
gang members.

3170
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:54,940
They're working with murderers,

3171
01:17:54,941 --> 01:17:57,880
working with criminals and
making money clearly profiting.

3172
01:17:58,730 --> 01:17:58,851
Well,

3173
01:17:58,851 --> 01:17:59,121
you know,

3174
01:17:59,121 --> 01:17:59,751
cops man,

3175
01:17:59,751 --> 01:18:00,890
they just like everybody else,

3176
01:18:00,891 --> 01:18:01,724
you know,

3177
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:03,620
they lie,

3178
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:07,520
cheat and all other things that the
normal person goes through in life.

3179
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:09,470
So I don't put nothing past him,

3180
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:11,540
especially when you start putting
all that money on the table.

3181
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:11,781
You know,

3182
01:18:11,781 --> 01:18:16,130
I remember my first young guy who got
arrested by him and they stole his money.

3183
01:18:16,131 --> 01:18:19,370
He was like 16 years old and he called me,

3184
01:18:19,371 --> 01:18:19,701
he was like,

3185
01:18:19,701 --> 01:18:20,211
quick man,

3186
01:18:20,211 --> 01:18:21,620
the cops just raided my house.

3187
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:22,641
I was like,

3188
01:18:22,641 --> 01:18:22,941
yeah,

3189
01:18:22,941 --> 01:18:23,190
you are.

3190
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:23,500
I,

3191
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:23,931
and he's like,

3192
01:18:23,931 --> 01:18:24,111
yeah,

3193
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:24,944
I'm cool.

3194
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:25,521
And I was like,

3195
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:26,261
what'd you ask him?

3196
01:18:26,261 --> 01:18:26,511
He's like,

3197
01:18:26,511 --> 01:18:26,691
man,

3198
01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:28,310
I had like $40,000.

3199
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,151
I said,

3200
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:29,984
what happened?

3201
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:31,041
He said,

3202
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:31,251
man,

3203
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:33,650
they asked me who money was
and I told him it wasn't mine.

3204
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:34,520
They told me to go.

3205
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,073
Wow.

3206
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,270
So when he got out,

3207
01:18:38,271 --> 01:18:39,140
when I got with him,

3208
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:40,500
you know we call the lawyer,

3209
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:41,231
you're told the lawyer you.

3210
01:18:41,231 --> 01:18:41,940
Amen.

3211
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:43,580
It was $40,000 at that house,

3212
01:18:43,581 --> 01:18:44,401
but with no drug.

3213
01:18:44,401 --> 01:18:45,410
So he called and they said,

3214
01:18:45,411 --> 01:18:45,561
man,

3215
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:46,640
with no money at that house.

3216
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:49,600
Wow.

3217
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,500
That's super common,

3218
01:18:50,501 --> 01:18:51,070
right?

3219
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:51,371
Yeah.

3220
01:18:51,371 --> 01:18:51,581
Yeah.

3221
01:18:51,581 --> 01:18:52,600
That happened all the time.

3222
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:55,540
There's no one policing the police.

3223
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,730
There's no one governing the government.

3224
01:18:58,530 --> 01:18:59,980
That's the real issue.

3225
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:00,843
They got the beginner,

3226
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:01,780
they got the guns.

3227
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:02,241
Well,

3228
01:19:02,241 --> 01:19:02,831
not only that,

3229
01:19:02,831 --> 01:19:04,210
they can change the laws.

3230
01:19:04,211 --> 01:19:06,430
I mean we see what the fuck is
going on now with this country.

3231
01:19:06,431 --> 01:19:09,010
It was like every week
they'd come up with some new,

3232
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,480
even more restrictive,

3233
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:15,040
even more or welling law that gets through
that allows them to tap your phones

3234
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:15,910
with no wire,

3235
01:19:15,911 --> 01:19:16,691
with no warrants.

3236
01:19:16,691 --> 01:19:17,440
Rather,

3237
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:17,930
you know,

3238
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:20,320
listening on your phone calls,

3239
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:23,860
tap your fucking gps systems that
could follow everywhere you go.

3240
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:25,720
And they can do all this
shit without warrants.

3241
01:19:25,721 --> 01:19:26,340
Now.

3242
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:26,561
I mean,

3243
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:29,200
and they do it supposedly
under the guise of terrorism,

3244
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:33,100
but it's really under the guise of making
it easier for them to prosecute you

3245
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,700
for whatever the fuck they want to cause
there's a God damn business and locking

3246
01:19:36,701 --> 01:19:37,900
people up in cages.

3247
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:38,651
Exactly.

3248
01:19:38,651 --> 01:19:39,310
Exactly.

3249
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:40,900
So that's what they into their new role.

3250
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,660
So you find your whole loophole
and then you chase after it,

3251
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:45,350
you're in jail.

3252
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,621
Right.

3253
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:46,480
And then once you,

3254
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,190
once you find it,

3255
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:47,440
Luke,

3256
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,110
remember that day when
I read it in the book,

3257
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:50,280
you knows like me,

3258
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:52,380
he just like popped out at me.

3259
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,273
Boom,

3260
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,870
go to jail,

3261
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:57,810
commit a crime and get released.

3262
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,110
I sat to the phone to call my lawyer.

3263
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:00,361
I see,

3264
01:20:00,361 --> 01:20:00,541
man,

3265
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:01,374
I found it.

3266
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:02,423
Wow.

3267
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,140
So what happens then

3268
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,800
where it was discouraging
what he said after he read it.

3269
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:08,370
He see it the same way I did.

3270
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:13,600
You're a better lawyer than your
fucking lawyer come Harvard.

3271
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:16,470
Why?

3272
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,800
I should get an honorary degree.

3273
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,050
Yeah.

3274
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:22,880
So I just told him to
do or put on the books,

3275
01:20:22,881 --> 01:20:23,121
you know,

3276
01:20:23,121 --> 01:20:24,410
then the judge went through her thing.

3277
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:24,801
Oh No,

3278
01:20:24,801 --> 01:20:25,590
Mr. Ross,

3279
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:26,960
not the way you said it is.

3280
01:20:26,961 --> 01:20:27,800
And I was like,

3281
01:20:27,801 --> 01:20:32,480
can she must came read if she
can't read that she can't read.

3282
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,940
So then the prosecutor went
through his whole thing,

3283
01:20:34,941 --> 01:20:39,050
but then I went to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals and they agree with me.

3284
01:20:39,051 --> 01:20:39,620
Totally.

3285
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:39,981
You know,

3286
01:20:39,981 --> 01:20:40,814
say that uh,

3287
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,451
if they,

3288
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:42,110
uh,

3289
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:43,640
did it the way they were saying do it did,

3290
01:20:43,641 --> 01:20:44,211
they would lock up.

3291
01:20:44,211 --> 01:20:47,090
Everybody would be career
criminals on their first arrest.

3292
01:20:47,091 --> 01:20:47,880
So

3293
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,121
yeah.

3294
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:50,130
Literally everybody would be in life.

3295
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,260
Here I am life.

3296
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:52,470
Here I am.

3297
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:53,553
Wow.

3298
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,850
So nice sort of ninth
circuit court of Appeals.

3299
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,170
They agree with you.

3300
01:20:58,410 --> 01:20:59,310
They side with you.

3301
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,480
You released immediately.

3302
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:00,910
No,

3303
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:02,370
and I had nine more years to do,

3304
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:02,970
man.

3305
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:04,410
Jesus Christ.

3306
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:05,880
Why nine more years?

3307
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:07,120
Uh,

3308
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,250
that's just where it was,

3309
01:21:08,251 --> 01:21:08,461
you know,

3310
01:21:08,461 --> 01:21:09,660
that's how much time I had left.

3311
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:10,111
Okay.

3312
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:11,880
So you had $20.

3313
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:12,690
They cut me down.

3314
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:12,891
No,

3315
01:21:12,891 --> 01:21:13,080
no.

3316
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:13,800
I had a life,

3317
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,090
but they talked me down to 20.

3318
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:19,450
So the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals cut you down a 20 Oh,

3319
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,190
okay.

3320
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:23,100
So at least you knew there was a light
at the end of the tunnel that right,

3321
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:23,520
right.

3322
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,110
So then I was happy with that.

3323
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,100
You were happy with that?

3324
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:26,371
Yeah.

3325
01:21:26,371 --> 01:21:29,160
I was going to lead a penitentiary
cause I was up in Lompoc penitentiary,

3326
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:29,521
you know,

3327
01:21:29,521 --> 01:21:30,920
USP Lompoc that help.

3328
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,830
What does that place like?

3329
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:32,671
Oh man,

3330
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:33,420
that's a dungeon.

3331
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,490
You know everybody in there,

3332
01:21:34,491 --> 01:21:35,670
I've got 40 years of better.

3333
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:37,110
You know,

3334
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:38,940
they mad at you or if you got 20 you know,

3335
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:40,500
they got to get you out
of there with 20 years.

3336
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:41,700
You know something might happen to you.

3337
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:42,803
Really,

3338
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:43,411
man.

3339
01:21:43,411 --> 01:21:43,591
Yeah.

3340
01:21:43,591 --> 01:21:44,880
That was kind of 21 years.

3341
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:47,400
Freedom is you're almost free.

3342
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:47,941
Yeah.

3343
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:48,570
You gotta,

3344
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,310
you gotta walk on egg shells around here.

3345
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,670
If you have 20 inches and you've
got between you and you to going,

3346
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:54,523
wait a minute,

3347
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:56,750
how they talk to him,

3348
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,830
they were like mad at you
or they'd be mad at you.

3349
01:21:58,831 --> 01:21:59,521
They're mad at you.

3350
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:00,480
If you only got 20 years.

3351
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:01,343
Yeah,

3352
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:01,820
that's,

3353
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:02,491
you got 30 years,

3354
01:22:02,491 --> 01:22:03,324
they might be mad.

3355
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:03,840
God.

3356
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:04,230
Damn.

3357
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:05,160
That's hilarious.

3358
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:06,071
Hilarious.

3359
01:22:06,071 --> 01:22:06,181
I mean,

3360
01:22:06,181 --> 01:22:06,960
you can get hurt,

3361
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,420
you can get hurt then just
because you got 20 years.

3362
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:12,000
How did you stay out of danger?

3363
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:12,860
Well,

3364
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:13,140
uh,

3365
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:13,651
like I said,

3366
01:22:13,651 --> 01:22:14,760
when I got my time cut,

3367
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:17,790
I only had to stay there like three
more months and I was out of there.

3368
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:19,200
So it was easy for me.

3369
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:19,410
And,

3370
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:20,750
and you know,

3371
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,370
I'm aware like guy to jail.

3372
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:23,730
Yeah.

3373
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah.

3374
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,520
They liked me and I get hers.

3375
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,600
Was the prison that you were in initially,

3376
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:29,070
the first president
before they moved you out?

3377
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:29,611
Oh Man.

3378
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,670
I saw guys get hit in the
head with a on mock ringers.

3379
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:33,601
Iron.

3380
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:34,140
What?

3381
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:34,973
Mock ringers.

3382
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:36,583
Wring the mop out.

3383
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,710
It's this great big old thing.

3384
01:22:37,711 --> 01:22:39,300
My way about 1520 pounds.

3385
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,030
Yeah.

3386
01:22:40,030 --> 01:22:43,340
You know the guy sitting in his chair
and the guy walks up behind him and just

3387
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,760
smashes a score with it.

3388
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,133
I mean,

3389
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:46,891
brutal,

3390
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:47,251
brutal,

3391
01:22:47,251 --> 01:22:47,730
brutal,

3392
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:48,563
brutal site.

3393
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:52,760
I seen a guy get beat with a baseball
bat and aluminum baseball bat into his

3394
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:52,991
head.

3395
01:22:52,991 --> 01:22:53,880
It was like mush.

3396
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,600
They had to helicopter him
out when the helicopter,

3397
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:00,060
I think he had brain damage stolen.

3398
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:01,160
He didn't,

3399
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:01,450
you know,

3400
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:02,283
was a vegetable.

3401
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,000
Uh,

3402
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,560
I've seen guys get stabbed.

3403
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:05,531
You know what,

3404
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:06,640
I'm taking a shower and you know,

3405
01:23:06,641 --> 01:23:07,630
you hear this loud noise,

3406
01:23:07,631 --> 01:23:09,370
like just keep bumping
up against the wall,

3407
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:09,761
boom,

3408
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:10,031
boom,

3409
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:10,271
boom.

3410
01:23:10,271 --> 01:23:11,200
Really violently,

3411
01:23:11,201 --> 01:23:11,471
you know,

3412
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:11,831
and you know,

3413
01:23:11,831 --> 01:23:13,540
this is somebody's body,

3414
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:13,841
you know,

3415
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:16,060
like why would somebody be
hitting the wall this hard?

3416
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:16,923
You know?

3417
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,243
And uh,

3418
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:19,700
so I,

3419
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:23,170
I wrap my towel up and I looked my head
out the shower when I see this guy and

3420
01:23:23,171 --> 01:23:24,190
this guy stabbing him.

3421
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:25,750
And so to get off tonight,

3422
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,170
he's just throwing this back and
hitting everything up against the wall,

3423
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:30,460
trying to get away from the knife.

3424
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:32,380
So what's really violent?

3425
01:23:32,381 --> 01:23:32,760
I mean,

3426
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,880
prison is really violent.

3427
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,301
You know,

3428
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:34,471
you,

3429
01:23:34,471 --> 01:23:35,650
you have to be careful,

3430
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,140
especially in the USP,

3431
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,553
the USP.

3432
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,660
But no one was a dangerous too,

3433
01:23:40,661 --> 01:23:43,170
but not as dangerous as USP because
these guys don't have nothing to,

3434
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,100
what does a USP us penitentiary,

3435
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:46,140
penitentiary.

3436
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:46,973
What is the difference?

3437
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:50,800
Well say for instance,

3438
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:51,820
the FCI,

3439
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:55,130
you can't have more than
20 years and be at the FCI.

3440
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:59,590
If you have more than 20 stands for
a federal correctional institution,

3441
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,150
that's like a medium.

3442
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:02,650
Okay.

3443
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,180
So if you could have more than than,

3444
01:24:04,181 --> 01:24:05,140
than than 20 years,

3445
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:06,400
you're going to go to a USP.

3446
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:07,541
Now,

3447
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:10,390
if you go to a FCI and
you've got 20 years,

3448
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:13,300
but you keep getting into trouble
fights and you know something,

3449
01:24:13,301 --> 01:24:16,270
maybe you stab somebody and then they're
going to send you to a USP in the hill.

3450
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:16,631
Okay.

3451
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:17,171
And you go up here,

3452
01:24:17,171 --> 01:24:18,610
these guys can handle stabbings.

3453
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,270
So they're there,

3454
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,920
they'll boost you up.

3455
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:22,920
Then they got what they call it,

3456
01:24:22,921 --> 01:24:25,300
a low is for the guys
who got like five years,

3457
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,193
six years,

3458
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,370
then you go to a low.

3459
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,640
So they kind of keep it separated
like that by your violence,

3460
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:32,620
by how much you're getting in trouble,

3461
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:33,483
things like that.

3462
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:37,300
So the a USP is the most dangerous.

3463
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:40,150
That's the most absolutely
absent murderers,

3464
01:24:40,151 --> 01:24:41,440
life sentences.

3465
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:44,530
And then they had guys from all over the
country safe and you in Washington DC

3466
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:44,830
and,

3467
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:45,210
and,

3468
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:46,043
and uh,

3469
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,550
you been getting in trouble in Washington.

3470
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:52,840
They see then they shipped you down to
California to keep you out of trouble.

3471
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,081
And you know,

3472
01:24:53,081 --> 01:24:54,640
some of those guys from DC or really,

3473
01:24:54,641 --> 01:24:55,474
really violent.

3474
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,700
And what they do is they take all the bad,

3475
01:24:57,701 --> 01:25:01,240
it's guys from all over the country
and they put them in u s s piece.

3476
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:02,680
So you may have a,

3477
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:06,430
a thing where guys are fighting
over territory like the TV,

3478
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:07,301
you know,

3479
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:10,540
like the DC guys or the
Philadelphia guys might say,

3480
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:10,751
man,

3481
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:12,180
we want to watch this program tonight,

3482
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,760
the Philadelphia 76 or the plans.

3483
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:17,290
So we want to watch Philadelphia 76 at
night because you're always watching the

3484
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:18,124
Lakers.

3485
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,300
So that could cause a fight.

3486
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:19,991
You know,

3487
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:20,321
it's,

3488
01:25:20,321 --> 01:25:21,730
it's kind of like territorial,

3489
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,181
you know,

3490
01:25:22,181 --> 01:25:23,014
the way it works.

3491
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,150
Did you get an anti violence interaction?

3492
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,140
Absolutely not.

3493
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,041
Absolutely not.

3494
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:29,110
I said no law library really.

3495
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,090
They don't come in a lot.

3496
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,093
Librarian fight.

3497
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:32,111
So how did you,

3498
01:25:32,111 --> 01:25:34,480
that's how you avoided
everything most of the time.

3499
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:37,550
And the only time I really
would put myself in a,

3500
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:37,960
in,

3501
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:38,291
in,

3502
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:41,230
in harm's way is when,

3503
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:42,400
when football season,

3504
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:42,611
you know,

3505
01:25:42,611 --> 01:25:45,040
I played flag football with the guys.

3506
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:46,390
I played basketball with them.

3507
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:47,140
Uh,

3508
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,870
but I always had a mentality to,

3509
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:49,240
to,

3510
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,380
to diffuse.

3511
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,150
Anything that ever happened,

3512
01:25:52,151 --> 01:25:52,930
I wouldn't fight.

3513
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:53,763
You know,

3514
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:57,130
if somebody followed me hard
on the basketball court,

3515
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:00,700
it was my fault because I put
myself on the basketball court.

3516
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:04,100
If I find somebody hard
on the basketball court,

3517
01:26:04,101 --> 01:26:06,530
it was my fault because I followed him on.

3518
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:10,250
So I would always apologize
to guys when I fired him hard.

3519
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:11,540
But that's just the type of person I am.

3520
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:12,200
You know,

3521
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,100
when I played basketball,

3522
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:14,090
I don't mean to hurt anybody,

3523
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:15,110
but sometimes I do.

3524
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:15,461
You know,

3525
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:16,430
I filed a lot,

3526
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:17,421
but,

3527
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:17,661
uh,

3528
01:26:17,661 --> 01:26:18,030
um,

3529
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:18,290
I,

3530
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:18,561
you know,

3531
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:19,394
I got along well,

3532
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:19,731
you know,

3533
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:22,400
people respected me and
I show up most respect.

3534
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,550
Did you have to align yourself
with any groups in prison?

3535
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:27,431
I didn't know.

3536
01:26:27,431 --> 01:26:32,431
I didn't even know I am
adopted by a most groups,

3537
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:34,161
you know,

3538
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:34,970
they adopt me.

3539
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:35,803
Most groups.

3540
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:36,001
Yeah.

3541
01:26:36,001 --> 01:26:37,550
Most of the groups in Geo adopt me.

3542
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:37,941
You know,

3543
01:26:37,941 --> 01:26:38,774
uh,

3544
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,011
I mean everybody,

3545
01:26:40,011 --> 01:26:40,311
you know,

3546
01:26:40,311 --> 01:26:43,110
the Philadelphia guys
that decrypts the bloods,

3547
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,613
uh,

3548
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:46,410
did dcs.

3549
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:47,041
I mean I'm cool.

3550
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:48,180
I'm just cold without all of them,

3551
01:26:48,181 --> 01:26:48,960
you know.

3552
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:49,620
Uh,

3553
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:49,771
no,

3554
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:50,920
only one property is not,

3555
01:26:50,921 --> 01:26:51,150
is,

3556
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:51,421
is,

3557
01:26:51,421 --> 01:26:52,254
is,

3558
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:53,903
is um,

3559
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:55,510
what's the,

3560
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:59,220
the cerenia knows and an brothers are
probably the only two groups that,

3561
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:01,400
but it's the Surenos Mexicans.

3562
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,120
Yeah.

3563
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,360
And then the area in brothers
obviously is kick your kid.

3564
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:04,780
Yeah.

3565
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,050
Yeah.

3566
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:07,270
Other than that I got along
and even they got it on,

3567
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:07,541
you know,

3568
01:27:07,541 --> 01:27:08,374
they would speak to me,

3569
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:08,950
you know,

3570
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:09,111
hey,

3571
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:10,000
you WIC what's happening?

3572
01:27:10,001 --> 01:27:10,480
But you know,

3573
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,320
we don't hang out.

3574
01:27:11,321 --> 01:27:12,030
No,

3575
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:12,381
we didn't know.

3576
01:27:12,381 --> 01:27:13,214
Hang out with blacks.

3577
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:14,750
Now

3578
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,220
the day you got out of jail,

3579
01:27:16,221 --> 01:27:16,790
man,

3580
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:21,320
what the fuck was that like the day you
get out of 20 years knowing that you got

3581
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:21,710
out,

3582
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:22,543
you know,

3583
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:22,860
oh,

3584
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:24,180
hair by hair.

3585
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:24,410
Yeah.

3586
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:24,630
No,

3587
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,290
it was luck because,

3588
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:26,491
you know,

3589
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,151
it was guys,

3590
01:27:27,151 --> 01:27:31,650
when I was in prison it was guys who
had the same issue I had that didn't get

3591
01:27:31,651 --> 01:27:32,484
out.

3592
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,170
Wow.

3593
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:34,950
They will argue that almost the same way.

3594
01:27:34,951 --> 01:27:35,411
You know,

3595
01:27:35,411 --> 01:27:36,151
a matter of fact,

3596
01:27:36,151 --> 01:27:37,440
we are trying to get the guy who,

3597
01:27:37,441 --> 01:27:37,740
uh,

3598
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:40,380
was the first guy to get a life
sentence for selling crack.

3599
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,810
We're trying to get his
interview and his issue was,

3600
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,280
was almost identical to mine.

3601
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:45,840
Just a little different though,

3602
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:47,010
but close.

3603
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:47,790
And he's,

3604
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:48,690
he's in for life.

3605
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:51,000
He's in it for life and he
was only like 20 years old,

3606
01:27:51,001 --> 01:27:52,290
19 years old

3607
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,900
and it was the same situation.

3608
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:57,060
They use the three strike rule
and here's the three strike rule.

3609
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:57,840
But he had,

3610
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,550
he didn't have three convictions.

3611
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:02,340
His conviction is a little different.

3612
01:28:02,341 --> 01:28:02,760
Right.

3613
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:02,991
He,

3614
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:03,221
he,

3615
01:28:03,221 --> 01:28:04,590
he did have convictions.

3616
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:06,023
Uh,

3617
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:06,961
he is,

3618
01:28:06,961 --> 01:28:07,481
was he,

3619
01:28:07,481 --> 01:28:09,510
he went to jail when he was 18 years old.

3620
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:10,720
Okay.

3621
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,150
He got out and the same day he got out,

3622
01:28:13,151 --> 01:28:15,460
he went right back on the block
and started selling dope again.

3623
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:17,170
And he got arrested that day.

3624
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:18,550
So he wasn't convicted,

3625
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:23,850
he wasn't convicted of the first
one when he caught the second one.

3626
01:28:23,851 --> 01:28:25,950
But they said it don't
matter if he was convicted,

3627
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,150
you had been to jail so you shouldn't
learn your lesson and you went back out

3628
01:28:30,151 --> 01:28:31,020
and you did it again.

3629
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:32,003
Uh,

3630
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,210
there's gotta be a lot of that.

3631
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,770
He was mad at me when I won.

3632
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:35,670
Really?

3633
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:36,131
Yeah.

3634
01:28:36,131 --> 01:28:36,420
And it,

3635
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:37,650
he's supposed to be my man too.

3636
01:28:37,651 --> 01:28:38,760
He was mad man.

3637
01:28:38,761 --> 01:28:39,091
How you,

3638
01:28:39,091 --> 01:28:41,400
when I had to say miss you,

3639
01:28:41,401 --> 01:28:41,851
I say no.

3640
01:28:41,851 --> 01:28:42,900
You as a little different.

3641
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,580
See I never got out on mine.

3642
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:45,511
See on mine,

3643
01:28:45,511 --> 01:28:46,290
they took me from,

3644
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:46,740
from,

3645
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:47,100
from,

3646
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:47,690
from La.

3647
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,800
They took me to Texas and took me to Ohio.

3648
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:51,720
Took me to St Louis

3649
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:53,720
all

3650
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,560
before I ever got released.

3651
01:28:55,561 --> 01:28:56,610
I never got released.

3652
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:00,120
Now when you got out was
the first shit he did.

3653
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:01,773
Uh,

3654
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:04,710
you already know,

3655
01:29:04,711 --> 01:29:05,544
man.

3656
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:06,810
It's been a long time.

3657
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:08,830
Oh my God,

3658
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:09,663
me saw me.

3659
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:11,850
Old girlfriends.

3660
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:12,540
No,

3661
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,290
no new growth.

3662
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:14,670
New Girl in new girl.

3663
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:15,690
Did you know this girl?

3664
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:17,340
The girl's like contact?

3665
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:18,420
Do you like while you're in prison?

3666
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:19,120
Yeah,

3667
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,120
I got a lot of matters cause you were
famous famous American gangster magazines

3668
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,930
and they knew you were coming
out to as he has magazine year,

3669
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:29,340
they knew I was coming home late day.

3670
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:31,530
They started to publicize
that I had got a date.

01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:58,470
If we were enterprise.com what is
a involved in this social network?

3683
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,770
Well when I do is I give people

3684
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,060
for the videos.

3685
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:03,901
You know,

3686
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:07,530
like a lot of the sites now they charging
and put the videos up and I don't,

3687

3688
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:13,090
they can meet friends and she loved
music and she had pictures and,

3689
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:14,220
and just different things.

3690
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:15,083
Uh,

3691
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:15,551
you know,

3692
01:30:15,551 --> 01:30:16,211
what they do on the,

3693
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:17,490
on social networks.

3694
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,380
So I offer those services for them.

3695
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:23,700
Do you have any insights scoop
on who killed biggie man,

3696
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:24,990
somebody else asked me that.

3697
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,940
He said those rolling
stone article read it.

3698
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:29,781
They said the ramp,

3699
01:30:29,781 --> 01:30:30,614
our cops did it.

3700
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:32,161
I don't have a clue.

3701
01:30:32,161 --> 01:30:32,371
You know,

3702
01:30:32,371 --> 01:30:32,880
I was at,

3703
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,980
I was at USP Lompoc
when biggie got killed.

3704
01:30:34,981 --> 01:30:35,730
I mean I was,

3705
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:39,330
I was disappointed that he came back
to California and I thought that was a

3706
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:40,320
little crazy,

3707
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:40,951
you know,

3708
01:30:40,951 --> 01:30:42,810
with what had happened to park.

3709
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:43,201
You know,

3710
01:30:43,201 --> 01:30:47,490
I knew that it wasn't safe for him to be
out here in California because guys in

3711
01:30:47,491 --> 01:30:48,220
California,

3712
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:49,380
a very revengeful.

3713
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:50,370
And uh,

3714
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:51,960
when I heard that he was in California,

3715
01:30:51,961 --> 01:30:52,351
I was like,

3716
01:30:52,351 --> 01:30:53,400
what was he thinking about?

3717
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:57,410
It's kind of crazy that musicians started
killing each other and it's been an

3718
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,110
amazing,

3719
01:30:58,110 --> 01:30:58,470
yeah,

3720
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,640
I mean that it never existed.

3721
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:02,790
We were just talking about this when
we were in Atlanta this weekend,

3722
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,390
that they were the first
musicians and artists basically,

3723
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:07,770
they would start killing each other.

3724
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:08,640
Wow.

3725
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,180
Wow.

3726
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:11,310
It's Tupac contacted you at all?

3727
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:12,650
Uh,

3728
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:13,040
Nah.

3729
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:13,873
Not recently,

3730
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,590
but I'm going to ask you,

3731
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:17,490
did two pot contact him yet?

3732
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:18,211
No,

3733
01:31:18,211 --> 01:31:19,044
he hasn't.

3734
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:19,830
Tupac,

3735
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:23,160
you mean the new hologram turned
out that people say Tupacs not dead.

3736
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:24,011
Nobody says that.

3737
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:24,840
That's not an idiot.

3738
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,610
A lot of people did like what's his face?

3739
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:29,430
Just said it the other day
and a big music executive.

3740
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:30,293
Uh,

3741
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,460
I'll tell you one second one.

3742
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:31,690
Yeah.

3743
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:33,960
This is a photo of him
on the autopsy table.

3744
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:35,041
It's a real simple,

3745
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:37,560
back in the days before they
had Photoshop to Fox dead.

3746
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:39,990
There's no doubt about it.

3747
01:31:39,991 --> 01:31:41,010
They killed that dude.

3748
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:41,791

They know this.

3792
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:31,340
They don't do Dina.

3793
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,273
Dude.

3794
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:35,800
Nobody's ever put out more music
after their death and Tupac,

3795
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:36,100
right?

3796
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:36,933
Yeah.

3797
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:38,793
Hologram.

3798
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:39,341

Yeah,

3801
01:32:42,251 --> 01:32:42,791
I heard about it.

3802
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:43,451
I didn't see it,

3803
01:32:43,451 --> 01:32:44,320
but I heard about it.

3804
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:44,681
He's,

3805
01:32:44,681 --> 01:32:46,540
it looked like Tupac had
been lifting weights.

3806
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:47,441
Is that right?

3807
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:47,920
Yeah.

3808
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,090
They had them all MMA doubt.

3809
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:49,661
He was yoked.

3810
01:32:49,661 --> 01:32:51,790
He looked like George St
Pierre was ridiculous.

3811
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:52,810
Seriously.

3812
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:53,561
Had a six pack.

3813
01:32:53,561 --> 01:32:53,890
It was,

3814
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:56,260
it was way more muscular
than the regular Tupac.

3815
01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:57,190
It was weird.

3816
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:00,190
It was like two pocket just been doing
kettle bells and crossfit and shit.

3817
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:01,563
You know,

3818
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:05,560
who was getting away with food and I mean,

3819
01:33:05,561 --> 01:33:05,891
you know,

3820
01:33:05,891 --> 01:33:07,510
they don't care who wins the war.

3821
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:07,781
You know,

3822
01:33:07,781 --> 01:33:08,860
they got both of them covered.

3823
01:33:08,861 --> 01:33:09,694
Biggie and PAC

3824
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:13,650
now record labels nowadays they're fucked.

3825
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:14,550
There's really,

3826
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:18,870
they have to make a percentage of the
artists that are out there performing

3827
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:19,411
live.

3828
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:19,651
Right.

3829
01:33:19,651 --> 01:33:19,831
I mean,

3830
01:33:19,831 --> 01:33:20,880
how do they make money now?

3831
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:21,951
Yeah,

3832
01:33:21,951 --> 01:33:22,101
yeah.

3833
01:33:22,101 --> 01:33:23,450
They do the three 60 deals.

3834
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:24,650
Um,

3835
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:27,530
what does that mean when you get
a percentage of everything you do?

3836
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:27,770
You know,

3837
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:29,060
if you do a commercial on TV,

3838
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:29,900
they get a piece of it.

3839
01:33:29,901 --> 01:33:31,700
If you a do a contract,

3840
01:33:31,701 --> 01:33:32,451
they get a piece of it.

3841
01:33:32,451 --> 01:33:33,890
If you get a tennis shoe endorsement,

3842
01:33:33,891 --> 01:33:34,724
they want a pizza.

3843
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:35,840
They didn't use to do that.

3844
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:36,171
No,

3845
01:33:36,171 --> 01:33:36,770
they didn't.

3846
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:38,420
They used to just be strictly music.

3847
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:38,751
But,

3848
01:33:38,751 --> 01:33:39,220
uh,

3849
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,900
and what do they always get a
piece of the live performance?

3850
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:43,893
Now they do,

3851
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:45,890
but they didn't always know really.

3852
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,840
So this is all post MP three world,

3853
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:48,320
right?

3854
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:48,850
Right.

3855
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,330
It used to be like the performance,

3856
01:33:50,331 --> 01:33:51,031
you should be all orange.

3857
01:33:51,031 --> 01:33:51,864
This is money.

3858
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,130
What is the benefit of
having a a music company?

3859
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,950
It seems like with the Internet it
would almost be a hindrance to be in

3860
01:33:56,951 --> 01:33:57,530
marketing,

3861
01:33:57,530 --> 01:33:58,160
marketing,

3862
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:58,931
marketing down us.

3863
01:33:58,931 --> 01:33:59,301
Cause you know,

3864
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:00,830
people believe what they see in here,

3865
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:04,730
but once you get to a point like a
Jay z or somebody who's already in the

3866
01:34:04,731 --> 01:34:06,260
contract so he can't get out.

3867
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,173
Uh,

3868
01:34:07,190 --> 01:34:11,330
but what I was saying is if he started
his own shit and started helping people

3869
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:12,530
promote themselves,

3870
01:34:12,531 --> 01:34:13,940
like he starts promoting people,

3871
01:34:13,941 --> 01:34:16,550
you could enable people to
become famous on their own.

3872
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:18,320
You think Jessie wants to help people?

3873
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:19,423
Why not?

3874
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:20,061
I mean,

3875
01:34:20,061 --> 01:34:20,600
I don't know.

3876
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,890
I mean I think that that
then it sounds logical.

3877
01:34:22,891 --> 01:34:23,130
Yeah.

3878
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:27,630
If someone explained to him how much
better his own life would be if he helped

3879
01:34:27,631 --> 01:34:30,150
other people's lives and it
makes you actually feel better.

3880
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:30,361
Yeah,

3881
01:34:30,361 --> 01:34:31,194
he'd probably try it,

3882
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,860
but it's hard to saint
that into people's heads.

3883
01:34:34,861 --> 01:34:36,210
Everybody's so fucking competitive.

3884
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:36,691
Yeah.

3885
01:34:36,691 --> 01:34:38,540
Everybody wants to just
get all the money in,

3886
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:38,791
in,

3887
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:39,840
in Haga foot himself,

3888
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:44,110
and they don't understand that someone
else's success does not equal failure for

3889
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:44,321
you.

3890
01:34:44,321 --> 01:34:46,810
It's not like success that was
yours and you didn't get it.

3891
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:47,411
This got,

3892
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:47,681
got it.

3893
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:50,670
It's not like there's only a certain
amount of gold out there and like you,

3894
01:34:50,671 --> 01:34:52,330
you're telling people
where the gold is at.

3895
01:34:52,331 --> 01:34:52,820
And again,

3896
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:53,051
you're like,

3897
01:34:53,051 --> 01:34:53,291
damn,

3898
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:54,490
that could have been my fucking gold.

3899
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:55,010
No,

3900
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:55,211
I mean,

3901
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:56,920
someone else's success has
nothing to do with you.

3902
01:34:56,921 --> 01:34:58,140
That's a whole new human being.

3903
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:58,990
Yeah.

3904
01:34:58,990 --> 01:34:59,741
It's crazy,

3905
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:00,790
but most people don't want to help.

3906
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:01,150
Nobody.
