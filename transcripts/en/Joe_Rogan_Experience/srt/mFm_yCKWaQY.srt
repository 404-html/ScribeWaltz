1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,601
Trey,

2
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:05,580
my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all
day while we get that champion Joe Jose

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:05,581
Aldo.

4
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:07,140
That seems weird to me.

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,983
It doesn't make sense.

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,330
It seems weird to me.

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,790
And then Max Holloway interim champion,

8
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:16,740
like what is going on when you have a
champion who didn't win the title in a

9
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,850
fight in the,

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,020
in the octagon,

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,800
he was awarded it after he won an
interim title against Frankie Edgar,

12
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,390
which is a beautiful
performance on his part.

13
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,070
And then Max Holloway.

14
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:27,930
Where's an interim like who's within?

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,290
Think about how Max Holloway gotta I love
Max Holloway says nine fights in a row

16
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:31,860
that he won,

17
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,750
but then he beats Anthony Pettis who's
never fought at that weight for weight

18
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,750
once before cell phones Oliveira
but really not a top contender.

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,231
Really.

20
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:41,610
Not Realistically not.

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,870
And then leaves the weight class and was
at 55 and you won your belt off that.

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,380
You know,

23
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,180
it's so fucking strange.

24
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,040
It's weird how everyone has belts.

25
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,990
Well do you think that this is just a
part of the transition between [inaudible]

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,920
and WME and that is going to be like this
transitionary period where everything

27
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,120
about powerful watch,

28
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,760
Tyron Woodley Champs got
good taste in Washington.

29
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,600
Is there a Rolex?

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,321
It's a fat one,

31
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:04,711
whatever it is,

32
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,340
it looks good.

33
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,770
But the thing being like that bad boy,

34
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,850
it could be an Invicta,

35
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,100
but the thing is it's like,

36
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,870
do you,

37
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,240
do,

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,550
you know there's obviously some
sort of a transition going on.

39
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,870
80 people have been fired,

40
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,010
including Goldberg,

41
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,220
right?

42
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,430
Yeah.

43
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:17,840
It's a,

44
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,930
it's a crazy time.

45
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,230
So I think they're scrambling for stars
and I think belts brings along some sort

46
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:24,901
of ratings.

47
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,490
I just think they're in
this feeling out pair,

48
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,550
this transition period that they're,

49
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,880
they're just trying to figure it out.

50
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:34,170
And I think that's why Dana's entertaining
this Conor McGregor fight because

51
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,030
what else would we talk about?

52
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,860
Name some,

53
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,170
they named something else big going on
in the UFC right now what's interesting

54
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:42,450
is is does WME,

55
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,141
are they really,

56
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:43,591
or you know,

57
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:44,490
this organization,

58
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,450
have they really been involved in
anything where the outcome is totally

59
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,290
unpredictable?

60
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,460
Like combat sports because like
the promotion for the Holly,

61
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,701
uh,

62
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,241
or excuse me,

63
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:57,570
the Rhonda fight was a perfect
example of something like,

64
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,550
well we really hadn't
seen it that way before.

65
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:04,020
We're really hadn't seen it go
100% heavy towards the superstar.

66
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,291
Right?

67
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,280
Hundred percent heavy.

68
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,960
Usually it's like,

69
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,201
you know,

70
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:10,980
you would see a promo piece like say
if it's like Woodley versus Wonderboy,

71
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,990
you would see Wonderboy highlights,

72
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,430
you would see Woodley highlights,

73
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,040
you would see ass kicking on both sides.

74
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,280
You were like Holy Shit,

75
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:17,851
what a fight.

76
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:18,684
I can't wait.

77
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,980
They didn't do that at all.

78
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,230
They get is the way they would do a movie.

79
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,680
Yes,

80
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,450
they did it the way they
are promoted TV show,

81
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:28,050
they did it the way they promote a new
Kiefer Sutherland series on Netflix.

82
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:28,831
You know what I'm saying?

83
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,290
Only the star but,

84
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,470
but that shouldn't say Netflix,

85
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:32,370
I should say like Fox.

86
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,340
That's what scares me because Dana
white when it comes to this is a genius.

87
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,060
He would never,

88
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,710
I don't think you would
allow that to happen.

89
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,930
So I'm just wondering how involved he is.

90
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:43,970
Cause Without Dana.

91
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,510
If you just have WME running it,

92
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,690
fuck it.

93
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,673
Look dope though.

94
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,301
I'll tell you what,

95
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,310
I don't agree with the
fact that they ignore,

96
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,420
I'm a,

97
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,150
I'm a purist in a lot of ways
when it comes to combat sports.

98
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,880
And I think you have to respect
the hierarchy of the champion.

99
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,680
I don't give a fuck who
was the famous person.

100
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,870
This championship thing is so important.

101
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,621
When you have the,

102
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,790
if you're going to have champions,

103
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,650
you've got to respect the champion.

104
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,850
Like whoever the fuck it is.

105
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,091
It's,

106
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:11,380
it's super important to make a big deal
out of the fact that person's champion.

107
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,380
And they made like almost no deal out
of the fact that she was a champion.

108
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,790
It was this weird situation,

109
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,210
but it was really well done in
terms of like getting me amp,

110
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:19,600
does it?

111
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,020
Well,

112
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,853
I disagree.

113
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,813
I can see,

114
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,500
but for me it was for me.

115
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:23,770
Look,

116
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,960
I can get re you're the
one doing the fucking,

117
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:26,820
no,

118
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,110
no,

119
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,370
no.

120
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,240
Most of that was not me.

121
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,550
Most of that was like you
open up the fucking curtain,

122
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:30,740
uh,

123
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:30,911
the,

124
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,340
the garage door and he
see her hitting the pads.

125
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,050
I had almost nothing in that.

126
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,190
The only thing that I said is,

127
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,160
I can't imagine she's not
going to come back and,

128
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:39,270
and be a,

129
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,750
you know,

130
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,670
what are motivated,

131
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:41,800
are pumped up or whatever.

132
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,760
By the way,

133
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,500
a lot of the stuff they
use in those promos.

134
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,000
Totally out of context.

135
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,950
Like when I was saying
that she's the best ever,

136
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,820
there's no one even close.

137
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,330
There's hurt.

138
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,300
And is everybody else was a long time ago.

139
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,010
That was a long time.

140
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,490
Correct.

141
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,500
I did not say that for this fight.

142
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:56,841
No,

143
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,040
it didn't say this for this place.

144
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,110
But you said that for the,

145
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,740
I think you said that for the batch go.

146
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:00,881
Hey,

147
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:01,240
a fight.

148
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,691
But yeah,

149
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:03,970
so see like when they're
making these promos,

150
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,490
patching stuff they're taking,

151
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,530
so for me,

152
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,630
I have a problem with that because
this is not what I would say.

153
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,200
Yeah.

154
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,651
So you're,

155
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:16,651
you're using like an old quote when she
was dominating people versus a new quote

156
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,730
post head kick,

157
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:23,350
knock out post the emergence of Amanda
Nunez after she stopped staring McMahon.

158
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,580
You verged is a,

159
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,310
you know what you're seeing
now in this division,

160
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,950
which is all this new blood coming up.

161
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:35,130
You're seeing this division percolate
and change and evolve and you're seeing

162
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:40,210
like higher level fighters come in
like Valentino Shift Chanko like Amanda

163
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,211
Nunez,

164
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:40,981
like Holly Home.

165
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,330
Like you're seeing all this
stuff take place in front of you.

166
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:48,250
Seeing this change in the women's division
the same way you saw a change in the

167
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:53,251
men's division from 97 to 2017 you're
seeing that now take place at an

168
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:56,620
accelerated pace and the
women in the women's division,

169
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,290
so who is dominant two years ago,

170
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,920
like to use a quote from two
years ago is really not fair.

171
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:03,310
I agree.

172
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,420
That's really not fair for them.

173
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,370
Kind of,

174
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,090
but,

175
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,430
but,

176
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,720
but it builds the fight up,

177
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:07,901
right?

178
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:09,910
It builds the fight up but
it's not the way to do it.

179
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,010
No,

180
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,451
I agree.

181
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:11,140
I'm appears to.

182
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,860
But the thing is is if you understand
this sport and you look at,

183
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,330
let's say you want to copy the NFL,

184
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,380
the NFL would never just focus on Tom
Brady because there's a good fucking

185
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,840
chance Roethlisberger wins next week.

186
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,240
Now imagine if they just did
all promos on New England.

187
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,841
People were like,

188
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,310
what the fuck is this?

189
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:27,761
Exactly?

190
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:31,120
This is some bullshit fucking good man.

191
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,870
Worse than that,

192
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,370
what you're talking about,

193
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,950
all promos that aren't the champion.

194
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,233
Yeah.

195
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,260
Which is worse than that,

196
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:38,681
right?

197
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,050
Because you're talking about someone
who just lost by brutal knockout.

198
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,790
They're getting a shot
right away at the title.

199
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,130
And the idea is that
even though they lost,

200
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,911
they lost,

201
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,990
but it was some bullshit.

202
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,311
She's now,

203
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,300
she's best back now.

204
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:50,450
She's Bafta for 11 days.

205
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,210
She back fucking 411 it's
just a bad business plan.

206
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,800
There was a lot of talk
by people that don't know,

207
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,710
but I was listening to people talk
about it like I don't know who they are,

208
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,000
executive type people.

209
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:02,511
And I was like,

210
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:02,781
wow,

211
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,960
you guys have this idea of
how this is gonna go down.

212
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,561
Like they,

213
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:06,791
they,

214
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,180
they were just super,

215
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,810
super connected to this idea
and I don't know who they were.

216
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:12,920
I don't know if they're friends.

217
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:13,640
I don't know.

218
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,520
But there was a lot of people that we're
talking then had this idea that she was

219
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,300
just going to go in and storm
the castle and take back her.

220
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,060
I had a conversation with a high up exec
that a big time corporation and we're

221
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:26,240
talking to him and I'm like,

222
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,960
oh my,

223
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,070
you have no idea.

224
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,933
What did he say to you?

225
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,520
He,

226
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:29,960
he,

227
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,100
we were talking about Connor and Rhonda
and he was neither one e less than

228
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,010
mountain had that one hiccup.

229
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,140
She will never lose again
and like that's not true.

230
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,140
Lots is a good deals.

231
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:38,150
None of them no did.

232
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,130
She would never lose getting.

233
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,570
She goes and he goes
and Conner not a chance.

234
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:42,020
I'm like,

235
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,070
what are you talking about?

236
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,810
Two of these people
were talking backstage.

237
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,390
Gods are like skews me.

238
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,590
These people were talking about stage
and one of them didn't know Newton.

239
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:50,450
It's his name.

240
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,483
Yeah.

241
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,130
They were calling her cannon
fodder boy and I was like nine.

242
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,043
They don't know anything.

243
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,391
They could be,

244
00:06:59,391 --> 00:06:59,601
I mean,

245
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,350
I don't know who they were.

246
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,350
Maybe they could be people who are friends
of people who know some people that

247
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:08,640
work at William Morris and they're
backstage dressed in fucking $2,000 suits,

248
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,560
so they look classy.

249
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,520
Who knows?

250
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,490
I don't know Willie Moore.

251
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,870
They shouldn't be doing anything
without going through Dana light first.

252
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,420
They should not be doing anything.

253
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,650
Yeah.

254
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,860
Been in the game way too long for you
guys to make any decisions without having

255
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,330
some sort of influence from a guy
who's come from the ground up from it.

256
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,651
You can't do that.

257
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:27,980
Listen,

258
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,160
our fan base is going to yell
bullshit on this man and if we,

259
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:31,480
if,

260
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,870
if Rhonda doesn't win,

261
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,310
we are going to get fucking rained.

262
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,630
Connor cannon fodder.

263
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:36,140
Huh?

264
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,711
Do you think?

265
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:37,040
Yeah.

266
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,430
Yeah.

267
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,600
That was the word that someone used.

268
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,870
Do you think that at this stage that
there should be some sort of clearly

269
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:49,751
established protocol as far as who
fight who and why you have to otherwise

270
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:51,500
you're no different than the WWE.

271
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:51,860
Right.

272
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,260
Then people won't take a lot of the
interim titles and the championship fights

273
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:56,930
serious.

274
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,310
Here's my argument against that.

275
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,320
Dan Henderson and Michael Bisping.

276
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,670
I wanted to see that fight.

277
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,210
It was goddamn touch.

278
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,160
Cause we love Dan.

279
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:04,780
I agree.

280
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,560
Love Dan and I love Mike and I love,

281
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,940
I know Mike wanted it back.

282
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,650
He finally got the title and he's like,

283
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:10,250
fuck this.

284
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,890
I know that guy knocked me out.

285
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,560
He's got his fucking picture
of him flying through the air.

286
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:15,710
Uh,

287
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,760
touching me in the head.

288
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,560
That's as long.

289
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,030
How cold the everybody
knows what that logo is.

290
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,270
Yeah.

291
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,660
He's like,

292
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,411
fuck him.

293
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:22,520
He landed it twice.

294
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:23,354
Then I'm in the fight.

295
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:23,781
No,

296
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,350
don't me wrong.

297
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,390
Matt might be fight of the year.

298
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,001
It's up there,

299
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:29,930
but I think you have to have some sort
of structure where people can see what's

300
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:30,764
going on.

301
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,761
It's just like,

302
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,210
maybe it's like a Usada
exemption exemption.

303
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,790
Brock Lesnar,

304
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,080
he got away with that for month.

305
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,520
I promise.

306
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:37,941
If you do that,

307
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:38,301
you're right.

308
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:41,760
You'll miss out on this really
fun kind of revenge pass.

309
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,613
Yes.

310
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,790
But then you can't say,

311
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:43,911
oh,

312
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:45,200
we want to be in the next NFL.

313
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:45,621
Let me ask you,

314
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:46,310
the NBA,

315
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,300
do you think,

316
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,650
I mean outside of like promote who see?

317
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,640
You see the thing is he can't deny.

318
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,431
It's weird.

319
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,250
It's like are you a sport
where someone has a very clear,

320
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,210
you know like the,

321
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,080
like the world series.

322
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,890
Like you can't,

323
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,920
like someone can't lose a game and then
all of a sudden be in the world series.

324
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,041
Right,

325
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:02,620
right.

326
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,540
It's just like there's a,

327
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,700
there's a protocol like you have
to go through that protocol,

328
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,320
but do you think that there's
a possibility you could
have something like that

329
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:14,880
some established set up but then they
could throw it to the Internet for like a

330
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,803
wildcard

331
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,320
cannot have that now and then maybe
the UFC gets three wild cards a year.

332
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,270
Oh God.

333
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:24,910
Oh my God.

334
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,490
Drama is the people who have
been answered in that thing.

335
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,270
But here's the other thing.

336
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,790
I wonder if an MNA young
Jamie shaking his head

337
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,690
for the all star teams and shit.

338
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:37,160
And then that's how y'all Ming is the
number one vote getter every year.

339
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,360
Why is it because Chinese
people is more of them?

340
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,780
Well,

341
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,613
technically yes,

342
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,160
but let me ask,

343
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,210
what does he do it online?

344
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,531
The Guy Right now,

345
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,660
that's the number one
forward for the warriors,

346
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:47,730
but like no one knows
even how to say his name.

347
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,563
Is he from China?

348
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:48,721
No,

349
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,920
his name is Josh shop with Trulia,

350
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:50,520
but he's gonna.

351
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,540
He's the leading vote getter.

352
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,680
Jeremy Lin to,

353
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,543
where's he from?

354
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,510
I have no idea.

355
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,343
Yeah,

356
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,040
I don't know.

357
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,873
Lithuanian maybe.

358
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,130
Let me ask you this question about it.

359
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,233
Here's a question.

360
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,201
Do you think,

361
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,970
I wonder about MMA,

362
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,530
whether being champion in most of the
divisions is even that important to the

363
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:08,100
fans?

364
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,933
In other words,

365
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,760
what's important to
people is Conor Mcgregor,

366
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:12,330
right?

367
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,021
Rhonda Rousey,

368
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:13,990
the people that have the co,

369
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,330
there's something colorful about them.

370
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,313
Complicated people.

371
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,310
Somebody who speaks well.

372
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:17,671
So we,

373
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:18,780
we watched those guys,

374
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,190
but I'm not so sure that because
Michael Bisbing is champion,

375
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,010
that his viewership goes up as your mom,

376
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,320
clinically proven that championship fight.

377
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,450
Terrible,

378
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,021
terrible point.

379
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:31,650
And you know what?

380
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,360
I need you to take a break after that.

381
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,473
But to your point,

382
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,020
you can say Rhonda was the bigger stuff,

383
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:40,170
but Ronald was a different force
and the reason she got so big as,

384
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,210
because she was champions
Rondo's never champion.

385
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,990
We're not even,

386
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,720
but also like what she was just,

387
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,290
she was winning and losing one.

388
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:51,030
It doesn't matter what she did to indulge
that whole popularity thing was very

389
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:53,880
different than Connor's approach of
Connor decided to take that exact same

390
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:57,720
approach and go do a ton of movies and
go do a ton of talk shows and go do a ton

391
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:58,020
of,

392
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,190
do one commercial Budweisers and
entourage and all this different shit.

393
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,350
If he started doing that same shit,

394
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:09,351
his star would rise proportionally to
weigh her star rose and his performances

395
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,330
inside the octagon was suffer
right proportionately to wear.

396
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:14,990
Hers did and he didn't do
it and he's still bigger.

397
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,010
We were talking about that
guy that did that interview.

398
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,420
He's a sports guy and
he was talking about,

399
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:19,900
no,

400
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:19,991
no.

401
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:20,431
The other guy,

402
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,660
the black guy who was with him,

403
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,953
is that his name?

404
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,300
And he had a great point.

405
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,490
Shannon Sharpe had a
great point and he said,

406
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,960
Rhonda cheated on MMA.

407
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:28,950
He said,

408
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,030
you gotta be all in and says you can't
go and do a bunch of other shit and think

409
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,610
you're just so much better than everybody
else that it's never going to catch

410
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:35,780
up.

411
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,780
He comes from another 1% or athlete knows
exactly how all this kind of tempting

412
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,490
shall Shannon Sharpe stuck
to the game to set it.

413
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:45,061
When he said it,

414
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:45,421
I was like,

415
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:45,991
this guy's dead.

416
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:46,320
Right.

417
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,640
I think this business model though,

418
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,630
the only problem with the business model
is that with MMA it's really hard to

419
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:55,210
invest in the champion because
of the nature of the sport.

420
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,340
The the belt.

421
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,980
We'll chant like especially when
you're investing for one fights,

422
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:00,670
right?

423
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,211
But still you're,

424
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:03,100
but you're investing because all the time,

425
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,290
but you're not investing
for in the champion.

426
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,900
You're investing in the organization
and the fact that they have the best

427
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:08,734
fighters in the world.

428
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,410
What you're doing with each
fight is promoting a fight.

429
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,550
What I'm saying is that you have to
respect the hierarchy of the championship.

430
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,480
Above all,

431
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,400
the champion is the champion.

432
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:21,850
And if you don't respect the hierarchy
of the champion of your somehow or

433
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:25,210
another saying that this champion ain't
shit unless this champion is fighting

434
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,260
Mike fucking Tyson when Tyson was 20
years old and just smashed and everybody

435
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,160
and you knew all my God,

436
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,900
this is going to be the youngest
ever heavyweight champion,

437
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,980
then you focus on that guy with the
same amount of fervor that it demands.

438
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,760
Right.

439
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,290
But that's not the case here.

440
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:38,501
You know,

441
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:42,280
you're talking about an insanely like in
that particular Ronda Rousey fight and

442
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,020
insanely dangerous champion.

443
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:44,410
Yeah.

444
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,570
Who just smashed me,

445
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:46,321
said Tate and,

446
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:47,860
and you're talking about an x factor.

447
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,341
We were like,

448
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:51,610
we really don't know what we're going
to kit exactly with Ron bess and put all

449
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:52,430
the money in the,

450
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:52,780
yeah,

451
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,200
right.

452
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,033
So you've got,

453
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,180
you've got,

454
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,120
but also you have an
insanely marketable champion.

455
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:58,751
First of all,

456
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,970
the first ever openly gay
women's MMA champion and man's l.

457
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:05,200
It should be never been an
openly gay MMA champion.

458
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:05,500
Right.

459
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,020
So you have the whole Lgbtq,

460
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,080
whatever they are now a is
username as about APA plot.

461
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,903
People that,

462
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,990
but you have also a bunch of people that
respect that in a progressive people

463
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:17,261
that say,

464
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:17,411
hey,

465
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:18,071
this is great.

466
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:18,521
Like look,

467
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,140
it shows how diverse the UFC is.

468
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:20,974
Sure.

469
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,850
He's amazing.

470
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:21,971
Yeah,

471
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:24,190
and the stupid shit that Meryl
Streep said the other day,

472
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:27,670
like one of the reasons why she probably
said it is because she's seeing Ronda

473
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,050
Rousey's face plastered
all over the place.

474
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,900
The face,

475
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,030
the place and she's saying,

476
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:31,570
Hey,

477
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,760
you know you take women of
foreigners out of Hollywood,

478
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:35,440
you're going to be left
with football and MMA.

479
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,220
She doesn't understand the full MMA like
you saw tonight was Gil Rodriguez is

480
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,430
80% foreigners.

481
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,130
It's so wrong about that.

482
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,180
And that's also art.

483
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,410
That's that jumping,

484
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,060
spinning back kick would be art.

485
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,220
Oh come on that you tell me
that three 60 round kick.

486
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,010
Just fucking dance but harder cheese.

487
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:52,900
You got to hit somebody with it.

488
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:53,241
Yes.

489
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:53,500
It's,

490
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,970
it's just like rhythmic gymnastics.

491
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,490
She just doesn't know
what she's on educated.

492
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,750
I mean if dance is an art than gymnastics
in competition is also an art because

493
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:02,501
it's very similar.

494
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,000
It's just under more pressure.

495
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,451
Right.

496
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:05,800
So of gymnastics is an art.

497
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,130
How the fuck is how our
three 60 round kicks?

498
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,670
Not,

499
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,503
oh shit.

500
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:10,930
Oh,

501
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,880
that guy on the ground is,

502
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,800
it was a bad motherfucker.

503
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:14,981
Hey,

504
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:15,551
it's weird.

505
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,470
She used her lifetime achievement award
to talk shit about MMA and football.

506
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,020
I think she was making
a clumsy larger point,

507
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,100
but yes,

508
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:24,461
for sure.

509
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,510
Celebrate what you,

510
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,301
oh,

511
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:27,960
it was Nina and saw the crime.

512
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,231
No,

513
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:31,090
and he didn't start off one whoa.

514
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,370
Rear naked around three.

515
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,100
That's a Amanda Nunez girlfriend hollow.

516
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:45,570
Okay.
