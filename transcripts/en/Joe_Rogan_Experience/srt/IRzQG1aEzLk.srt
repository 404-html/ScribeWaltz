1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,020
We are trying to give zero for zero.
Joe Rode a

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,170
fascinating thing to transmit,
kind once said about a mushroom trip.

3
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:13,440
He asked a mushroom,
how could he possibly,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,680
how could anyone possibly save the path
that humans are on?

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,870
And they said very simply and very
easily.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,790
Each parent,
each,

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,500
each couple should reproduce.
Once you know two people,

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,950
they have one kid.
Everybody relaxes the whole the

9
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:30,390
resources.
Relax everything.

10
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,220
Relax.
It's like there's plenty of fucking

11
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:32,821
people.
Okay.

12
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:36,000
There is zero worry that people are
going to go extinct.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,540
But then the problem is how do you go to
those people?

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,420
Like those crazy people that were on
that TV show that had 19 children,

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,730
many of those people.
First of all,

16
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,470
what is she,
what is she in labor for like three

17
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,590
seconds.
I mean,

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,473
what,
what?

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,030
Does he actually have sex with her or
does he just jerk off into the abyss?

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,530
Like how,
how,

21
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,360
how are those babies actually
fertilized?

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,490
Um,
that,

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,260
that woman,
how could you tell that woman she can't

24
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,250
do that.
I mean,

25
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:04,040
I think it's a freak show.
I think it's,

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,260
I think resources wise,
like I have three kids,

27
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,140
it's hard,
it's hard to give them all the time that

28
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:11,270
they deserve,
you know,

29
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,240
and me and my wife had discussed that
when it comes to the possibility of

30
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,220
having more children,
I said I think we should really

31
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:21,080
concentrate on raising the ones we have.
Like they're fun and it's great and I,

32
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,090
they needed a lot of time,
like children need a lot of time and I

33
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:27,240
enjoy giving them that time.
But I think that if you have another kid

34
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,970
around,
everyone gets a little bit less time and

35
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:34,400
I think in that getting less time,
there's some benefits to independence

36
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,990
aspect of it as long as there's love and
there's comfort.

37
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,750
But I also think you can teach kids a
lot of shit,

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,340
you know,
and you could teach them a lot,

39
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,420
especially if you really are into it and
you concentrate on it and you read a lot

40
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:49,590
of books on it,
which I'm really involved in the idea of

41
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:52,110
raising kids.
I'm raising little human beings.

42
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,680
So the conversations that I have with
them are all geared towards that.

43
00:01:55,681 --> 00:02:00,030
Like it's geared towards enlightening
them is to the world and it sort of

44
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:02,250
guiding them is how to,
how to treat people,

45
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:04,440
how to be nice to be,
but it'd be nice to your sister or like,

46
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,450
Be Nice to have to pee,
don't,

47
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,570
don't get angry at things for no reason.
Look at it this way instead of that way.

48
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,000
And I think that,
you know,

49
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,320
you ain't gonna miss a lot of that when
you have 15,

50
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,460
16 kids,
you're going to like,

51
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:18,120
do you guys just shut the fuck up,
shut the fuck up organized teams.

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,200
You,
you're responsible for your little

53
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:19,681
brother,
you are,

54
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,720
you're responsible for.
And that's what those people did.

55
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:23,940
Those people have like every kid has a
chore and every kid,

56
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,600
that's how you're raised zombies.
I mean these kids,

57
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,130
they're not going to know what the fuck
is going on in the world.

58
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:32,760
Like they're going to need someone to
help them every day is spent doing tasks

59
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,030
and,
and your life is basically religion,

60
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,160
homeschooling and these tasks.
That's those kids.

61
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,290
That's the 19 people.
What are they?

62
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,110
The duggins,
what they call a CV.

63
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,700
I find that,
I mean,

64
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,420
I don't think you could tell those
people not to do that.

65
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,070
I think this is America and America has
got it's faults,

66
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,930
but,
but think about it,

67
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:55,980
they only neutralized like eight gay
couples neutralized when you went.

68
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,800
I mean like those kids,
you average it out,

69
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,220
like you got eight gay couples

70
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,960
who don't have any kids or adopt a kid
which takes it out of the pool and

71
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:05,620
you're,
you know,

72
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,100
mathematically you can have outliers
like that because there are lots of

73
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,070
people like me who don't have kids,
you know,

74
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:12,460
and just,
I mean,

75
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:17,410
I think the way to do it is to remove
the stigma around not having kids and to

76
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,740
encourage 'em to n w what Helen,
Sarah hrdy calls aloe parenting.

77
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,010
And this gets back to the hunter
gatherer thing.

78
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
Like kids are raised by everybody.
You know,

79
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,174
they say,
you know,

80
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,770
two parents are better than one.
Yeah,

81
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,790
that's true.
But you know what?

82
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,820
Five parents are better than two takes
pressure off you,

83
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,200
right?
Because you get frustrated,

84
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,370
you get tired,
you know,

85
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:42,910
their mother gets tired and it also,
it's enriching for the adult.

86
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,460
I love being around kids for a couple
hours.

87
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,841
Yeah,
no,

88
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,420
I know fully.
You know,

89
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,480
we had a party at my house,
had the day and there was a gang for

90
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,010
Halloween.
There was a Halloween party and there

91
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:58,420
was a gang of kids over and it was fun.
It was fun talking to other people's

92
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,850
little kids and you know,
seeing other different and how they

93
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:03,580
behave different,
have different ideas about stuff and you

94
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,960
know,
there's nothing wrong with that.

95
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,350
This is the family,
the 19 folks that live at home together.

96
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,360
Nice House stuff for 19 guy has been
making some good bank be paying for all

97
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:17,490
those kids.
Maybe just loves to fuck all this

98
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,810
religion stuff.
It's just to keep them all around.

99
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,690
Just love sending it in.

100
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,550
Nineteen kids seems a little excessive,
but again,

101
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,420
he's anal not for really religious
people.

102
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,890
I think it's in the Bible.
Do you know that?

103
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:36,460
That was Sarah Palin.
She said that Sarah Palin had a

104
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:39,820
conversation with a librarian and was
Cilla Alaska,

105
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,630
where she said that on the Internet
there was a photograph of,

106
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,330
of human footprint inside of dinosaur
footprint,

107
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,880
and the woman,
like the woman like talked about this

108
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:51,820
and Sarah Palin was running for
president or vice president,

109
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,260
whatever,
and she was like,

110
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,720
what?
Pause the

111
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,270
fuck.
Like this is a woman that got a

112
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,120
heartbeat away from being the president.
And she thought she thought that

113
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:08,890
dinosaurs and humans walk together and
then you see people who are intelligent

114
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,190
get that pill that down.
Brian claim dinosaurs of people

115
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,360
coexisted because they say they're about
the librarian.

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,570
I'm whatever.
I think that,

117
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,980
um,
uh,

118
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:26,140
what's the other one?
I'm not Sarah Palin.

119
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,890
Michele Bachman.
Michele Bachmann's worse.

120
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,320
Well,
her husband's gay rights is gay,

121
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:36,010
is gay as gay,
as gay as the day is beautiful and long

122
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,530
and flowers smell pretty and butterflies
are beautiful.

123
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:41,380
That guy's gay and allegedly he can't
suck enough dick.

124
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,350
There's no way.
If you could just give him a free pass,

125
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,200
if you ever got that guy liquored up and
put a heart on in front of him,

126
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,260
he would jump on it like Greg Louganis
off the top peer swan dive on that.

127
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,490
His head would be spinning out of a gain
or he'd still get some tongue on the

128
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:58,850
chef.

129
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,450
He would automatically starts salivating
to the point where it was like a

130
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:07,451
waterfall coming out of his mouth,
which is pouring down shirts just so

131
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,330
alive.
A Long Street.

132
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,660
No where the pool started and the saliva
for Dick coming out.

133
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:14,990
Okay.

134
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,540
Yeah.
It would literally be like a saliva

135
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:21,020
waterfall and when,
when when people have a backyard and

136
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:26,021
they have those really like,
like fancy little rock formations where

137
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,940
the water comes down into their pool.
Fancy schmancy.

138
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:29,774
That was his mouth.

139
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,530
Yeah.
If he.

140
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,050
He would say to a young man,
do you want to go in the hot tub with

141
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:34,100
me?
And the guy would go,

142
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,570
okay,
they'd get in the hot tub and the guy

143
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,100
would go,
there's no water in here.

144
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,990
And he'd go,
just wet

145
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,650
cock,
warm and gooey.

146
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:46,300
It's comes out 96 degrees.

147
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,140
I'd let them blow me if I knew that I
could take down Michelle Bachmann

148
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,490
particular down.
From what though?

149
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,190
Just because she will be an elected
leader.

150
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:57,810
Joe,
you really feel that?

151
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:59,100
I know.
So look,

152
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:03,990
you just have to see who fox news is
trotting out and she is one of the first

153
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:08,370
pundits they go to for comments on shit.
She is introducing legislation in

154
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:11,280
Congress right now that is actually
being enacted.

155
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,010
So what's the stopper?
Me,

156
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,860
I will suck her husband's Dick and
release it on the.

157
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,420
On the Internet.
I'll take the hit.
