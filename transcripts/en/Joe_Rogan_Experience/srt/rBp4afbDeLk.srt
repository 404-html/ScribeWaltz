1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,520
Keep this about a fist away and we're 
live.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,900
Douglas,
first of all,

3
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:09,370
thanks for joining me.
Appreciate it.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,750
Great presence to be with you.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,800
Looking forward to talking to you like 
you've become an example to me or your 

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,511
conversation with Sam Harris.
Become an example to me of how squirly 

7
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:24,740
things have gotten lately with the way 
people interpret conversations about 

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,570
ideas because of this.
Jamie,

9
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:32,571
pull that thing up.
This is a tweet that someone sent out 

10
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:36,080
and he got a strike,
a community guideline strike just for 

11
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:40,200
listening just for putting you on his 
playlist,

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,380
a conversation between Sam Harris and 
you.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,060
And uh,
he.

14
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,340
This man,
um,

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,920
or I don't know if it's a man.
I'm,

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,680
I'm,
I just assumed I'm,

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,480
I'm a problem.
I'm part of the problem.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Part of the Patriarchy pet are Kaye cee,
cee x on twitter.

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,380
That is his screen name or his or her or
Azura screen name on twitter and got a 

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,950
community guideline strike for just 
putting this.

21
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:11,820
Now I brought this up too.
I was having dinner with some friends.

22
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:16,821
One of them who used to work at Google 
and someone who's there was a highly 

23
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:17,260
ranked person.
Okay,

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,280
Youtube.
I brought this up and the exact quote 

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,950
was,
uh,

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,590
that was because it's hate speech.
And I said,

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,590
you said that so flippantly.
I go,

28
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,660
please tell me the contents of the 
conversation.

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,450
Do you know what they talked about?
I go,

30
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:37,451
how did you say that she was white?
I'm sure if someone marked it as a 

31
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:41,631
community guideline,
strike a community strike.

32
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:46,641
What is it called?
The community guidelines that they must 

33
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:46,740
be hate speech.
I'm like,

34
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:49,410
do you understand?
This is Douglas Murray and Sam Harris.

35
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,340
I,
I bet.

36
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,430
I bet that's not what the conversation 
was about.

37
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,910
I bet it wasn't too.
I'm trying to think of what we did.

38
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,410
Talk about it now.
It's making me nervous.

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,490
I mean,
but I know that.

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,580
I know.
It definitely wasn't hate speech by any 

41
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,820
saying definition of those words that 
you,

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,630
this sort of thing is very disturbing.

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,690
Very disturbing.
You and you noticed that happening with 

44
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,080
other people and that's disturbing 
enough is more disturbing.

45
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,990
Of course it happens to you,
but it's real.

46
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,910
I mean,
I know Sam Harris a bit,

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,080
not a hateful person,
my most sorta yoga calm,

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,980
blissed out west coast of America 
friend,

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,700
and I'm pretty amazed that anyone at 
Google or anyone else would think that 

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,090
anything that could come out of his 
mouth with hate speech,

51
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,150
hate speech,
unless you decided that hate speech is 

52
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,731
just anything you'd personally don't 
like or the words don't matter anymore.

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,230
Well,
that's what I'm concerned about.

54
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,550
I'm concerned that

55
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,320
there is an agenda that people who work 
in these.

56
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,360
We don't even have to name the 
organizations,

57
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,880
but in certain organizations are

58
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,010
left leaning and I mean it's probably 
better than being extremely 

59
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,630
right-leaning,
so it really is.

60
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:10,120
It's probably better than them being 
white supremacists,

61
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,040
white nationalists hate groups probably 
far better that they're radical lefties,

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
but it becomes a problem when you're 
doing things like that because things 

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,050
like that limit free speech and they 
limit the free discussion of ideas.

64
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,540
I don't.
I didn't listen to your conversation.

65
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,790
I think I listened to a little bit of 
it,

66
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:32,791
but I didn't listen to enough of it to 
know whether or not you guys started 

67
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,140
screaming at the end word halfway in.
I'm sure I'd remember.

68
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm sure.
I'm sure you would have this moment.

69
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,140
I had another thing that I talked about 
with this same person.

70
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,560
I brought up Jordan Peterson and you 
know that there's.

71
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,460
There's issues with every time he's on 
podcast,

72
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:56,461
the podcast get flagged for 
demonetization and the exact words were,

73
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,861
he's a troublemaker and I'm like,
what in the fuck are you talking about?

74
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:04,000
Like are you listening to his 
conversations?

75
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:09,001
He is very articulate and he's extremely
careful going over these ideas that I 

76
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:16,681
think we should all be discussing,
so to call this hate speech or to call 

77
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:17,410
someone a troublemaker.
It to me,

78
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:21,010
it's simple.
Simplify or symbolizes what we're.

79
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,460
What we're dealing with today.
This is a very strange time when it 

80
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,251
comes to communication and the people 
that regulate and distributed 

81
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:29,251
communication.

82
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:33,410
It is whenever I've had a chance to 
speak with people in that kind of world 

83
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,650
and that sort of role.
The question I always want to ask him on

84
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:40,300
other things is,
do you know where this is going to lead?

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,970
Do you know what it's going to do if you
keep breaking down definitions and terms

86
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:47,590
and words,
do you know what happens?

87
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,520
For instance,
down the road,

88
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:53,521
if,
if you keep on saying that Sam Harris 

89
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:54,430
and Doris Martin having a conversation 
about something is hate speech.

90
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,670
Do you know what relief that's going to 
give other people down the road about 

91
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,310
what they're going to be able to get 
away with?

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,010
This is what's being created all the 
time.

93
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:08,011
In the moment.
It seems to me there's this idea that 

94
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:09,901
you,
you police the discussion along 

95
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:12,691
incredibly narrow lines that happened to
surround your own comfort zone and call 

96
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:15,770
everything outside.

97
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,770
It's not just stuff I don't agree with 
or things that I would argue with or 

98
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,440
debate with hate speech.
Uh,

99
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,990
it's just,
I think very,

100
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:27,991
very dangerous down the road you can see
exactly the trail that bit of gunpowder 

101
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:29,620
goes to.
I can.

102
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,740
Where do you think it goes?
I think it goes to the point where 

103
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,891
people become cynical about any,
any claims made about anyone and the 

104
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:43,471
likelihood is that if 99 times you've 
seen Sam Harris started with Mary Joe 

105
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,500
Rogan,
Jordan Peterson,

106
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:49,501
whoever called hate speech,
then the hundredth time that somebody 

107
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:55,501
uses the term hate speech might be on 
somebody who is engaging in hate speech 

108
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:56,710
and all your defenses are going to be 
down.

109
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,040
You've got nothing.
You're very likely to become a very 

110
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,040
unlikely.
Sorry to become skeptical.

111
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,570
Um,
and think I'm really gonna dig that.

112
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:10,571
Most of us don't have time.
We didn't have time to find out every 

113
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,320
single thought and words someone has 
uttered or thought.

114
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,850
And so it seems very likely to me that 
down the road very,

115
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:21,851
very bad people were able to get through
the gates because we kept on making 

116
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:27,011
erroneous claims frivolously for our own
short term gain and fro in short term 

117
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:32,501
comfort.
And we'll end up basically bringing the 

118
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:32,510
gates down completely.

119
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,010
I agree with you and I,
I think there's been a lot of discussion

120
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:41,011
lately as well that I agree with where 
when you make these ridiculous claims 

121
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:45,240
about conversations,
you,

122
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,290
you empower,
you actually empower radical people 

123
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,750
posed left wing ideology.
Yeah.

124
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,840
They get more extreme.
You empower the extremists because they 

125
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,680
know that you're incorrect.
They have evidence of it.

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,540
They see your ridiculous behavior and 
the other really disturbing aspect of it

127
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,870
as these are the people that are 
distributing speech,

128
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:10,190
right?
I mean think about how many discussions 

129
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,190
are viewed daily on Youtube.
It's stunning

130
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,940
the,
there,

131
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,340
um,
there's so much.

132
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,540
I mean,
we're at the beginning of this.

133
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:22,541
I don't wait because I mean there's a 
long way for this to run a long way for 

134
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,631
the censorship to run the long.
You can't help thinking among other 

135
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:28,871
things that the people trying to make 
the rules at the moment have no idea of 

136
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:30,230
the fact that these debates have 
happened before.

137
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,860
Well,
have not bothered to look into them and 

138
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,440
seem to think that history started with 
them.

139
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,280
And I just wish that among other things 
with social media,

140
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:43,910
people realized w we have been through 
this several times before at least,

141
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:48,911
and the lessons are pretty clear,
are not that you can limit speech in 

142
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:54,260
order to obtain political nirvana,
for instance,

143
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,760
a.
nor are they,

144
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,160
that you can simply use,
I say,

145
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,160
for short term gain accusations,
you know,

146
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,100
to be wrong.
Right?

147
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,960
In order to further a short term 
political goal,

148
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,480
uh,
we know all this.

149
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,040
We've been through a printing press.
We went through with John Stuart Mill.

150
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:18,041
We went through it with Milton.
I just wish these people had any idea of

151
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:21,640
the fact that history started before the
parents can see them.

152
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,640
Well,
it's such that the whole culture of tech

153
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,850
today is such a progressive thought 
bubble.

154
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,790
It's,
it's an echo chamber and it's very,

155
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,580
very hard.
I,

156
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,750
like I said,
it's better that they're really 

157
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,960
progressive and open minded and left 
Wayne and radical right wing.

158
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,110
I think it's better.

159
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,920
Yeah.
No,

160
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,580
I agree.
I mean,

161
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,780
if by radical right wing you mean.
Yeah,

162
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,680
of course.
Although these people have all,

163
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:53,260
as I say,
all the ability to create those people,

164
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,600
right?
Um,

165
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,660
which is power it empower them,
which is something you don't want actual

166
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:05,001
racists and Nazis to have legitimate 
grievance claims and you don't want them

167
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:09,030
to be able to disguise themselves as 
something they're not.

168
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,600
So I say I had a friend who,
um,

169
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,020
a lot of friends involved in the 
Northern Ireland conflict in many years 

170
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,020
ago in the UK and all that many years 
ago,

171
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,240
one writer had a beautiful phrase about 
w w where you've got the stage wherever 

172
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,281
I was killing everyone.
He said you also got to the stage where 

173
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:27,360
truth was whatever you were having 
yourself.

174
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,630
And um,
we're not far away from that.

175
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,750
That place where I say what you call is 
hate speech.

176
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:40,770
You see what I say is hate speech.
Let's call the whole thing off.

177
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,710
We're not very far away from that 
actually.

178
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,910
Yeah.
It's,

179
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:49,150
uh,
it's very strange that this,

180
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:51,820
uh,
this echo chamber is being so reinforced

181
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,820
and that very few people are stepping 
out and saying,

182
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:55,420
well,
wait,

183
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,870
let's take a look at this.
Subjectively know the people that do do 

184
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,871
that are signaled out as being racist or
sexist or homophobic or transphobic or 

185
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:05,100
what,
you know,

186
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,700
fill in the blank.
Whatever is convenient.

187
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,020
Yeah.
And it,

188
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,020
but it's not surprising that more people
don't want to stick their heads up.

189
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,650
That's perfect because I mean,
if you had a normal job,

190
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,250
uh,
you worked in a normal office or sharp 

191
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:19,250
or something,
you,

192
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,900
you really don't want this coming 
towards you,

193
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,200
right?
Um,

194
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,240
I,
I mean this,

195
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:29,241
this can tear apart and tear down people
who spend a lifetime demonstrating they 

196
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,980
are not the thing that they're being 
accused of.

197
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:36,981
So if nobody knows anything about you,
you have no particular persona out 

198
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:38,700
there,
you have no particular back record.

199
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,420
You don't want this and coming to tell 
your life down,

200
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,480
right?
Because recovering from that accusation 

201
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,150
is almost impossible and will take you 
wherever it is basically impossible.

202
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:51,900
And all that you do along the way is to 
keep reminding people of the charge.

203
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,900
And if you were to ever win on a 
technicality,

204
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:56,820
like everyone would have forgotten the,
Oh yeah,

205
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:57,480
that's the,
uh,

206
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:59,340
that's the racist.
That's the rapist.

207
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,690
I mean he was pro rape,
isn't remember him.

208
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:03,930
Yeah,
it's so simple,

209
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,650
but it's.

210
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,360
I feel like we're in some strange 
adolescent stage of communication and 

211
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,040
there's been a bunch of talk lately.
There's.

212
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,680
There were some something that I tweeted
earlier today,

213
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,860
some new technology that they believe 
were ai is going to allow people to 

214
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,110
literally see other people's thoughts.
Right and I am forever optimistic but 

215
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:35,081
also terrified and my feeling is that 
our transition from language,

216
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:41,051
here it is,
new ai system can see what you are 

217
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:43,571
thinking,
which is just what the hell does that 

218
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:44,930
mean?
I'm I'm concern,

219
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,960
but also optimistic.
I feel like we're in this transitionary 

220
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,680
period from regular communication to 
written communication,

221
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:54,040
to written communication on line

222
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,840
two,
speech online,

223
00:11:55,841 --> 00:12:00,841
video online where there's this instant 
access to all this and these ideas are 

224
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:05,491
being debated and tossed around like 
beach balls in real time and ideas are 

225
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:10,801
being distorted.
People's positions are being distorted 

226
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:14,840
for for other people's gains and that 
there is this willful misuse of the 

227
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:20,611
truth and that something is going to 
come along that's going to combat that,

228
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,660
but at what price?
I mean the.

229
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,800
I can't see what would come along to do 
it other than people rebelling against 

230
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,280
it.
Their own free will as it was.

231
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,010
It doesn't seem like that's happening 
though.

232
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,040
It seems like there's a few people that 
are rec like yourself and there's many 

233
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,160
others that are recognizing the problem 
with this.

234
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:40,990
There's people talking about the problem
of it online,

235
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,230
but for the most part the mass of people
are engaged in this and it's also it's 

236
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,250
idea sport.

237
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,290
There's idea sport going on where their 
side,

238
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,030
they want their side to score.
Sure,

239
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,150
sure.
Well,

240
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,720
that's always old politics and your 
country at any rate at the moment is how

241
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,710
can we make sure that the other side 
trips up on this,

242
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,830
and I've felt this,
I've written this all through the me,

243
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,240
an era that in your country and their 
mind,

244
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:14,860
people are basically are willing to go 
for somebody who is a political opponent

245
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:19,861
who does something very minimal and 
they're willing to defend somebody on 

246
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:22,660
the inside who does something bigger and
you can see it all the time.

247
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,180
It just.
There are different standards that apply

248
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:30,181
to your own side then apply to the other
and people don't seem to be hiding it 

249
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:33,961
very much anymore.
Not at all and they really don't have 

250
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:33,961
the ability to hide it.
No.

251
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:38,020
We had a case recently in the UK where 
somebody who was a great heritage of the

252
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:43,021
left full sorts of complicated reasons 
was accused of some fairly.

253
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm very serious,
groping accusations about how this and 

254
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,990
exactly the left wing MPs who had been 
claiming that somebody who had sent out 

255
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:57,340
a tweet about a woman's breasts in 2009 
should never hold any role in public,

256
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,020
said that this person who just happened 
to be a friend and an icon of theirs was

257
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,690
a changed man and we have to recognize 
this.

258
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,870
Eighteen months ago now,
and my favorite video on this was a.

259
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,900
There was a guy who is a some rigid 
religious Christian man on television 

260
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:19,681
and he was talking about trump and he 
was talking about who trump was before 

261
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:22,030
he became president.
He goes,

262
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:27,031
but I don't know about you,
but I've found Jesus and I did not have 

263
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:30,270
a past put praise Jesus and he's saying 
this and everyone's cheering.

264
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,490
He,
whoever he was before he found Jesus 

265
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,150
side as if trump got into office.
It was like,

266
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:38,860
you know what?
I'm a new man.

267
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,090
I found Jesus.
I got the Jesus passed all that stuff 

268
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,440
that I did the last 70 years.
Well,

269
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,160
some people,
some people do treat that as a 

270
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,100
journalist.
Malcolm muggeridge very distinguished 

271
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,100
figure in the media,
um,

272
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,100
some years ago,
but

273
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,520
who it was often noted that his,
he converted to Catholicism and he,

274
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,850
uh,
a mutual friend once said that it was 

275
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,831
noticeable.
Malcolm muggeridge always attacked 

276
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:05,771
advice immediately after he had become 
incapable of it himself when it was 

277
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:14,150
clear the mortgage didn't have as much 
sex as he did fairly often in his youth.

278
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,790
Sex was a big problem.

279
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,100
It's a giant problem.
He needs to let everybody know.

280
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,160
Yeah,
virtue signaling to the highest degree.

281
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,430
Let everybody know this is awful.
All that pleasure and flesh stop it.

282
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,620
I wouldn't have it.
I had a lot of it,

283
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,690
but I won't have it anymore.
Not In my bedroom.

284
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,200
It's just,
I don't know,

285
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:36,770
man.
I'm just,

286
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm hopeful.
I'm hopeful that we're gonna work 

287
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:41,800
through this.
But um,

288
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,790
I'm also disturbed because no one's at 
the wheel.

289
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:49,390
There's,
there's no particular logical human 

290
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,601
being that's out at the wheel that has a
real rational sort of a solution for all

291
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:55,610
of these issues.
It's just chaos.

292
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:56,620
And in funding,
the

293
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,390
problem is,
again,

294
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,460
it comes back to thinking about the 
truth being whatever you're having 

295
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,441
yourself.
We don't have any one that we might 

296
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:05,300
mutually agree on some kind of empire.
I mean,

297
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,430
that's,
that's becoming,

298
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,550
that's becoming part of the problem.
Who,

299
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,490
who,
who.

300
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,490
I mean,
I'd be very suspicious of any empire put

301
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:13,140
forward,
but,

302
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,400
but where would you roughly look for 
one?

303
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,650
I'm a,
I like to think that truth is still 

304
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:20,770
massive,
but you know,

305
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:25,771
when you discover that a lot of people 
don't seem to particularly care for it 

306
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:27,490
or willing to sacrifice it,
as I say for some other purpose,

307
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:30,280
including winning a goal.
Um,

308
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,870
it's hard to see how you could 
adjudicate in this era,

309
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,590
but just one of the photos in it,
which is a lot of this has to do with 

310
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,180
whether or not the online world can 
forgive.

311
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,640
This seems to me to be a really central 
thing.

312
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:50,641
One of the,
one of the things that came up the case 

313
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:53,671
I said recently about this 2009 cases,
somebody in Britain who tweeted about a 

314
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:57,781
woman's breasts,
among other things was he mistook 

315
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:59,770
twitter for a conversation with friends.

316
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,430
And how did he do that?
You know,

317
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:09,431
I mean,
he's in public office and a journalist 

318
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:10,710
and a,
but was,

319
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,930
was going to get a public office anyhow,
but the point is,

320
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:14,720
is that,
uh,

321
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,010
you know,
we don't really know what the rules are 

322
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,571
that are.
I mean like what if you were a bit of a 

323
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:23,881
Dick 10 years ago like that on a medium 
that people were still finding their way

324
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:29,371
on and now you are genuinely,
you moved on kids and,

325
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,630
and yet the,
the breast tweet is always with you.

326
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,720
I mean,
it's a sort of dystopian nightmare that 

327
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,140
you'd always be stuck with your worst 
joke.

328
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,290
You'd be stuck with your lowest sort of 
crisis moment recently with Bill Maher,

329
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,370
right?
Bill Maher,

330
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,210
there was something that he wrote,
I think in 1989.

331
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,800
Right?
Which is insane.

332
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,370
I mean,
29 years ago he wrote something and uh,

333
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,110
people used it recently against him in 
29.

334
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:07,320
I don't know how old billy is,
I don't think bill is even 60,

335
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,990
so we're talking about something that he
wrote when he was in his twenties and he

336
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,660
was a struggling standup comedian.

337
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,420
The,
uh,

338
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,580
the,
the,

339
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,140
the,
the is very good for this,

340
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,380
isn't it?
Because you can,

341
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,110
you can,
you can dig up everyone.

342
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,390
Everyone's made.
Everyone is.

343
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,950
Everyone's screwed up from you,
you know,

344
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,600
apart from yourself.
It's a w.

345
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:31,150
We had somebody recently in Burton who,
who ever wanted to go for suddenly and 

346
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,350
they found an article he had written 
about saying he didn't agree with 

347
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:36,940
Holocaust denial laws.
Okay.

348
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:37,470
He said,
he said,

349
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,990
he said he just thought it was a bad 
idea for free speech,

350
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,750
you know,
uh,

351
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,910
when the,
when the Internet was a second story to 

352
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,310
find out other stuff about it and they 
found an article which said,

353
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm a Holocaust denier,
so,

354
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,600
you know,
prosecute me sorta thing,

355
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:56,601
which he isn't a Holocaust denier.
It's just nobody bothered to read 

356
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:59,040
beneath the headline and say suddenly in
the middle of the thing,

357
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:04,041
wherever I was telling about his life,
they also said Andy's a Holocaust 

358
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:04,041
denier,
and that was,

359
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:08,091
that was that.
And unlike something he wrote 15 years 

360
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:08,610
ago and it wasn't even an event,
it's a headline or something.

361
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,590
Uh,
and yeah,

362
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:11,490
and everyone.
And again,

363
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,580
nobody cares.
Get onto the next victim.

364
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,310
Uh,
everyone's a Nazi.

365
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,620
It's almost like people,
I mean,

366
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:23,920
it's obviously the case of living 
glasshouses and throwing tons of rocks,

367
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,340
but it's almost like everyone is just 
trying to throw as many rocks as they 

368
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,840
can before rock start coming their way 
because they know it's inevitable.

369
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Well,
I thought I felt until February the 

370
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,600
object of life in the modern era was to 
prove everyone else was a racist Nazi,

371
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,070
misogynistic,
transphobic.

372
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,080
And then you win is somehow coronation 
or something.

373
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,060
Everyone would say,
oh,

374
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,060
you're the person who's good,
but now,

375
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:52,970
yes.
It seems everyone is aware that it's,

376
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,130
it's,
it's a Mexican gunfight.

377
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:02,590
Yeah.
I have a friend of mine who had been on 

378
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,260
this podcast before,
back when he was a radical lefties,

379
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:08,270
name's Jamie Kilstein,
and he's a stand up comedian and he was 

380
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,740
a real radical social justice warrior,
male feminists,

381
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,500
lefty,
and they turned on him radical.

382
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,110
What did they do horribly at?
Well,

383
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:17,000
they found out he was trying to have sex
with girls.

384
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,390
That can be another one and it was all.
It was just having sex.

385
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:21,910
That was it.
He,

386
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:22,880
he,
he,

387
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,620
he didn't rape anybody who didn't grow 
up.

388
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:25,850
Anybody.
He just,

389
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,950
he threw some passes and less passes are
100 percent successful?

390
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,790
Yes.
Yeah.

391
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,330
Oh yeah.
The same exact paths could be your 

392
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:40,330
future wife.
Right.

393
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,560
And this one just felt 15 yards short.
There's no room for error,

394
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,490
but he,
he took long time off of social media in

395
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:51,310
a long time off of performing and these.

396
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,450
He came on and was really brave about it
and he talked about who we used to be 

397
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,090
and he said he was in this frantic state
where he was just constantly attacking 

398
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,831
people,
just attacking people and then checking 

399
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,871
his twitter or see who responded to that
attack and where people are on his side,

400
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:12,060
you know,
are people agreeing with him as he 

401
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,030
getting those social justice points that
he wanted and he was really honest about

402
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:18,031
the feeling that he got the Ang anxiety 
that I think a lot of people engage in 

403
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,110
on a daily basis.
A lot of.

404
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,950
If you go to people,
there's quite a few people that I follow

405
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:24,790
that seem to just always be in conflict 
and I just go to watch.

406
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,670
I'll just go to their page almost like 
I'm watching a fistfight in the backyard

407
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,000
and they're just.
It seems like there's this.

408
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,090
They're addicted to this constant seesaw
of emotions and this interaction.

409
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:42,090
It is.
It releases the necessarily chemical in 

410
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,090
the brain.
They get,

411
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,830
they get upset when they step away from 
it for a bit.

412
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,320
I don't engage in any of that,
that bit of it because I've seen 

413
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,570
suddenly a lot of the most mediocre 
minds of my generation brought low by 

414
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,531
this.
I mean there are some people who I 

415
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,720
admired until I followed them on social 
media and,

416
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,300
and now I just think,
you know,

417
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,500
your,
the shouty angry person who's,

418
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,990
who's,
who's like a drunk at closing time,

419
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,350
desperate,
flailing around with your fists are 

420
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,570
looking for somebody to fight with them.
And,

421
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,250
and to what end,
you know,

422
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,150
the other,
another experience I had,

423
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,180
I've had in recent years that led me to 
not want to engage in this is walking 

424
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,220
around in various events in sort of 
breakout things.

425
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,890
You people who,
you know,

426
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,730
really people I've admired in the past 
all saying things like,

427
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,240
you see that,
you see I flame decks on twitter.

428
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,370
I do see what I tweeted about that 
person.

429
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:42,371
I think these used to be serious people 
in these used to be serious.

430
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:48,641
People engaged in serious things and 
here they are engaged in these for 

431
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,420
flailing fistfights and often,
often let's face it on things.

432
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:59,951
Which if you didn't do it like that,
seeking out the fight or the sort of 

433
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:01,520
thing that would allow for normal human 
interaction.

434
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:06,521
I mean,
how many disagreements do we have with 

435
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:06,521
people in our personal lives all the 
time?

436
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:08,450
If we wanted to write,
you didn't vote this way,

437
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:13,451
that way.
I mean some people would mind about 

438
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:13,451
that,
but you know,

439
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:13,451
I know you've,
you think slightly differently for me on

440
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:17,861
this particular issue,
you don't say let's have that out now 

441
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:20,360
once and for all you,
um,

442
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,420
you,
you find ways to live with people's 

443
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,510
differences and different opinions and 
you're not going to get everyone exactly

444
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:27,330
in line.
I mean,

445
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,440
we all knew that before the age of 
social media and now it seems to be the 

446
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,740
only aim.
What do you think that is?

447
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,120
I mean,
think it's what we were discussing 

448
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,481
earlier,
that it's idea of sport and then you 

449
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:42,161
just get caught up in like someone 
volleyed your way and so you have to 

450
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:42,161
smash that tennis ball back their way.

451
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:43,480
It is something like that.
I mean,

452
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:46,010
I,
I can't say I haven't felt the vicarious

453
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,620
pleasure of some of that myself.
You know,

454
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,160
that old Chinese proverb about I'm 
sitting by the river watching the bodies

455
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:57,161
of your enemies float by.
I had a big sense of that the other day 

456
00:23:57,161 --> 00:24:01,781
when somebody I deeply disliked came 
across her on social media at the same 

457
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:07,001
time as somebody else I deeply disliked 
was being held by the French police on 

458
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:07,910
serious charges.
And I thought that was,

459
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,020
I felt like the Chinese proverb.
That's all right.

460
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,480
And so I can,
I can see why people feel it.

461
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:19,481
Sure.
And of course people who they could 

462
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:21,350
never normally get to who they've got 
to.

463
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,400
I mean,
I think that's,

464
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:23,470
I think that's the big,
uh,

465
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,900
the big thing of,
you know,

466
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,140
look,
I poked that.

467
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,410
You know what?
I never engaged on social media for 

468
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,821
precisely that reason,
that reason among others that you would 

469
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:37,870
never,
I would never want somebody to know that

470
00:24:37,871 --> 00:24:38,750
they could get to me.

471
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,180
Even if they,
even if you just block them,

472
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,480
there's many people who take pride.
Even in their heading.

473
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,660
They say,
I am blocked on twitter by all these 

474
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,271
people and,
and actually I do sometimes read what 

475
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:52,271
people say is sending to me.
Um,

476
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,300
and I've never blocked anyone because I 
sort of thing you should mind that if 

477
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:57,560
you put your ideas out there,
you might as well be as open as possible

478
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:00,890
to receiving them back some time ago 
when I got into a car with the,

479
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,310
with the Turkish president about,
uh,

480
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:05,480
about something,
uh,

481
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,050
I got all these Turkish,
uh,

482
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:08,600
uh,
sort of accounts sending me stuff.

483
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,050
There's one guy,
he just repeatedly sent me a pornography

484
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:15,550
of animals having sex with.
So I didn't know it is,

485
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,300
it's very,
it was very hardcore.

486
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,440
And um,
and so I used to go down the feet.

487
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,390
Now that gun I didn't even block in 
actually because I sort of thought,

488
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,200
well,
somewhere in Turkey,

489
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,200
he's a really angry man,
desperately finding horse pornography 

490
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,480
send to me.
And in a way I felt so sorry for him 

491
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,310
that that was how his life had come up 
with the end.

492
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,870
His life had come to at this stage that 
I,

493
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,330
I couldn't even block him.
And also he'd be like,

494
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,540
I'm the donkey porn guy who got blocked 
by dark.

495
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,250
He'd get a certain thing.
What was his motivation for sending you 

496
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:50,750
this stuff?
He,

497
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:51,690
I,
um,

498
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,580
it was because,
well,

499
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,620
the short story is a couple of years ago
with the Turkey's president tried to get

500
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,691
the German chancellor to imprison a 
German comic for a very rude poem he'd 

501
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:11,111
read on air on German television that 
was insulting about the Turkish 

502
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,711
president.
And the German authorities actually 

503
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:17,621
started a case against the comedian for 
insulting the Turkish president,

504
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,460
Edwin.

505
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,460
And uh,
I,

506
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,290
uh,
decided to launch a,

507
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,070
a,
a,

508
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,730
an offensive poetry competition to 
offend the Turkish president.

509
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,840
And there was a thousand pounds cash 
prize and it sort of took off.

510
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,841
And in the end,
the now foreign secretary entered in 

511
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:38,320
one.
Yes.

512
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,590
That's great.
Yes,

513
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,800
it was really good because at the same 
time that the Germans were looking at 

514
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,980
imprisoning a comedian,
uh,

515
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,720
the,
the now foreign secretary,

516
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:52,050
the UK was guilty of precisely the same 
alleged crime.

517
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,530
I eman,
it wasn't a crime,

518
00:26:53,531 --> 00:26:55,860
it couldn't be a crime.
A couple other people did.

519
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,630
Wonderful Dutch comedian friend,
Hans Johnson,

520
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,610
or sort of a similar thing that time he 
decided to do an interview live on Dutch

521
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:05,760
television,
explaining how much he hated him because

522
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:07,560
he still owed him money from the 
blowjob.

523
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,650
He'd given Edwin in a sauna and the 
Dutch authorities were looking at.

524
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,030
Actually we're looking at.

525
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,680
They were asked if they would prosecute 
him,

526
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,780
but anyhow,
but this was,

527
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,820
this was,
I had a great time with this of course,

528
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:27,060
and I wrote a limerick explaining how 
I'm abusive.

529
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:32,061
I wanted people to be about Edwin,
that it wasn't necessary to be highly 

530
00:27:32,061 --> 00:27:35,421
defamatory and you wouldn't get away 
with it if you just called him a banker 

531
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:39,000
or something.
So I wrote the opening verse and invited

532
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,060
the world to contribute,
which they did and it became,

533
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:47,061
among other things,
the highest paid poetry competition in 

534
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:47,061
the world.
If,

535
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:47,061
if like me,
you read a Limerick,

536
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:48,680
just five lines,
200 pounds a light.

537
00:27:48,681 --> 00:27:49,290
And I mean,
no,

538
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,900
no.
A poetry,

539
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:54,030
a magazine could pave for such a,
uh,

540
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,250
such such work.
So anyhow,

541
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,080
on the basis of that,
I became very,

542
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:01,050
very unpopular in Turkey.
And there were many,

543
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,550
many pieces talking about how this gay 
atheist,

544
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,720
terrible Edwin Hater in Britain was 
exactly what we're up against.

545
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,160
So him and his poems.

546
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,090
Oh my God.
Wow.

547
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,150
Yeah.
So the German government was actually 

548
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:20,400
considering.
Yes.

549
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,980
Prosecuting this guy.
How far did they take it?

550
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,200
Uh,
he was taken in for questioning.

551
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:30,201
I know he had to retain lawyers.
I'm fairly sure they did only drop it in

552
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:33,480
the end because of the international 
attention that was paid to it.

553
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,120
There was this easy,
there was this law on the books.

554
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:41,121
It's still set.
It was less imagine stay Lord about 

555
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:41,910
defending foreign rulers.
And he had,

556
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,340
he had done it for such an important 
reason as well,

557
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:46,050
which was to say,
you know,

558
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,180
we in Germany should have the right to 
be rude about Edward,

559
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,990
particularly Edwin,
who you know,

560
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,680
was promoted for Matt to Prime Minister.
Now the president wants to be so tired,

561
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,130
you know,
I mean,

562
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,490
it is a very bad man.
Locked up more journalists per capita,

563
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:04,491
I think,
than any other country in the world 

564
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:04,491
other than China,
which I don't think we can get the stats

565
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:07,620
on a very,
very evil.

566
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,090
I think man who,
who has led his country backwards in the

567
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:17,091
last 20 years and this is in the process
of trying to destroy a wonderful country

568
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,580
and if you can't be rude about him,
if you can't pretend that he sleeps with

569
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:24,130
animals,
um,

570
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,360
which is what the German comedian 
started with,

571
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,840
then somewhere down the line you might 
be able to say anything about the 

572
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:32,960
imprisoned journalists either and so on.
And,

573
00:29:32,961 --> 00:29:34,830
um,
since also by the way,

574
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:40,040
people don't seem to spend my time 
worrying about the Turkish journalist 

575
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,320
Edwin in prisons.
I'm the least.

576
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,390
They paid attention when I said that.
Uh,

577
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,750
he and Angela Merkel got up to really 
filthy filthy acts in the zoo.

578
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:56,410
Well,
obviously the worst case of retaliation 

579
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,560
for humor.
It's probably Charlie Updo,

580
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:58,880
right?
I mean,

581
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:03,881
which is a terrible.
And unfortunately many people weren't 

582
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:09,620
defending the murder,
but we're talking the murderers.

583
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,450
I mean,
I think how many.

584
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,960
I think it was 11 people were murdered 
and ended up placing a police officer,

585
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,740
um,
they,

586
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,980
but they were saying that instead of 
concentrating on the murder,

587
00:30:21,981 --> 00:30:26,981
which was done completely out of this,
reinforcing their rules of their 

588
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:32,621
ideology and in retaliation for any 
mocking of that ideology,

589
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,020
instead of that,
they were talking about how racist 

590
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,020
Charlie Hebdo was.
There was a lot of that.

591
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,730
In fact,
my friend Jamie Kilstein was a part of 

592
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,531
that.
He was on television back in his super 

593
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:48,431
social justice warrior days.
Talking about that you wish you might 

594
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:48,470
have other things that people said,
no,

595
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,870
I'm not talking about something if they 
don't know about it.

596
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,650
Yeah.

597
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,910
In my guess was that until,
until the murders,

598
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,190
I mean an infinitely small number of 
people knew about Shaadi Abdo outside of

599
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:06,191
France.
I found myself in the wake of that in 

600
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:08,840
studios with people who I know how to 
just googled Charlene's up there the day

601
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:13,841
before.
I know that they just gone to wikipedia 

602
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:16,781
and read an English version of a claim 
about what that magazine was about.

603
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,930
Goes back to my point about the 
journalist in the Holocaust denial thing

604
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:24,110
that you just root around a bunch of 
people being killed.

605
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,980
This doesn't seem to vindicate my sides 
ideology.

606
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:30,650
Therefore,
let me find what I can do to defame them

607
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:31,250
and.
Oh good.

608
00:31:31,251 --> 00:31:34,310
Somebody.
Charlene Abdo once did this cartoon that

609
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:38,630
was off color and I can't understand 
what the words are beneath it,

610
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,140
but I'll,
I'll claim it's racist to me.

611
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:42,260
People were actually doing that.
They're actually,

612
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,460
there were,
there was a,

613
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:48,461
um,
there was one cartoon that was used 

614
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:48,461
against Charlie Hebdo after the 
massacre.

615
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:53,080
Uh,
that was a joke against the front 

616
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,571
nasional and the claims they were making
about the black woman in Sarcozi 

617
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,060
government.
But because the joke and the rich,

618
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,960
if you didn't speak French,
it wasn't clear.

619
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:04,870
It apparently,
but it.

620
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,760
And if you knew nothing about recent 
French history,

621
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:09,120
you knew nothing about the social,
the Sarcozi administration and,

622
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,550
and the,
and the ministry in question.

623
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,080
These people just went to it and said 
racist cartoon.

624
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,000
Not Noticing that the cartoon was 
actually a joke about racists,

625
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,250
but they didn't.
They didn't bother to find that out.

626
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,550
And I thought that I thought that whole 
thing among many,

627
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:29,870
many other things was deeply worrying 
from that point of view because it means

628
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:34,610
that in the immediate aftermath of 
something that should be so damn clear,

629
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,060
a bunch of people can just try to 
reframe the narrative.

630
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Yeah.
And really change the history of a 

631
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,660
publication.
Yeah.

632
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,380
Um,
claim it is just something different.

633
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,840
And,
and for a lot of people,

634
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:52,440
of course that was very,
um,

635
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,920
that was very convenient because after 
all,

636
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:57,710
if Charlie,
his staff actually were these racists,

637
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:02,711
then you know,
you didn't need to worry too much about 

638
00:33:02,711 --> 00:33:04,500
them or why you'd been silent on the 
issues they've spoken up about.

639
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Yeah.
The narrative then been that these 

640
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,861
people had been mocking this 
disenfranchised marginalized group in 

641
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,660
society and that they had it coming in 
some very strange way.

642
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,780
And it's part of me struggled with that 
because I was like,

643
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:26,781
is this,
some people just have contrarion 

644
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:26,781
instincts.
Everybody's going left.

645
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:27,510
They just go,
I don't like it.

646
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,660
And they want to go the other way.
There's so many people that have that 

647
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:32,660
instinct.
And then there's,

648
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,160
as you said before,
this headline mentality,

649
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,740
they read the headline and don't look 
any further into it.

650
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:39,810
Even if it's a headline about a 
headline,

651
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,390
it's theirs.
That's all they need.

652
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,420
They're armed with enough facts.
They slam their laptop down and start 

653
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,420
debating.

654
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,510
Yeah.
And in that case,

655
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:54,511
as in many others,
totally lose sight of the only thing 

656
00:33:54,511 --> 00:33:56,050
that matters.
The only thing that matters in that case

657
00:33:56,051 --> 00:34:01,051
being,
is it ever right to make apologies for 

658
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:06,610
people walking into an office and 
gunning down people for an opinion.

659
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,730
You don't like the honest,
which has to be,

660
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:11,620
of course no.
Has to be,

661
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,370
has to be now.
And yet in these moments.

662
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:17,780
So we had 1:20
years before with the rush,

663
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,300
dfs,
the satanic verses.

664
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:24,310
If in these moments you discover that 
you don't have the allies on your side,

665
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:27,910
you thought you did in the wake of the 
rush,

666
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:32,950
tfl and 89,
it was people from the right and the 

667
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,500
left in Britain who started making 
excuses for the ayatollah in,

668
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,640
uh,
uh,

669
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,640
we had,
uh,

670
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,660
the,
the chief rabbi of the UK Djokovics to 

671
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:42,660
his,
to his shame,

672
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,641
said both Mr Rusty and vio taller has 
offended people's feelings as if someone

673
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,790
had in,
in,

674
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,070
you know,
called on all novelists to go to Tehran,

675
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,330
assassinate the ayatollah if they had a 
chance.

676
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,990
You had a,
um,

677
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,750
somebody like a right wing conservative 
minister,

678
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:07,170
uh,
Jeffery Howe who said that said that 

679
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:07,180
overall she had done,
had really offended Britain.

680
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:10,780
He'd been rude about Britain as if that 
had anything to do with anything.

681
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,100
Um,
there was uh,

682
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,230
one,
um,

683
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,470
there was one famous case of a,
of a conservative peer who said about 

684
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,990
Rushdie that he wouldn't bother him if a
group of young Muslims took Mr Roche 

685
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,620
into an alleyway and taught him some 
manners.

686
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,210
And so,
and you had that from the left as well.

687
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,210
Bernie,
granted,

688
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,220
Labour MP famously said at that point 
the burning books wasn't a problem for 

689
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:37,570
him.
Um,

690
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,890
and uh,
that was when they were burning the 

691
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:42,890
satanic verses in Bradford,
so,

692
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,560
so you get these weird coalitions of 
people who suddenly turned out not to 

693
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:46,860
get the point,
not to get the point,

694
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:51,861
not want to defend,
and then of course you get the cowards 

695
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:51,861
to say things like,
well,

696
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:51,861
it wasn't my sort of novel,
you know,

697
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:53,220
I,
I didn't think novel was all that good.

698
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:58,221
I midnight's children,
I could cope with static versus he lost 

699
00:35:58,221 --> 00:36:01,341
me with a plot as if that means that 
then you can call for the death of the 

700
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:02,430
author rather than just give it a bad 
review.

701
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,580
How is he now?
Salman Rushdie still in hiding.

702
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,090
I know he does a lot of interviews now 
and it seems to be more relaxed.

703
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,950
Yes.
He seems to be,

704
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:13,140
I don't know the specifics.
He,

705
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:15,810
um,
there was an assurance,

706
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:19,770
I think given some years ago in the 
labor year Labor government,

707
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,770
the width Tehran,
that they would not actively,

708
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,460
uh,
um,

709
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,530
uh,
encourage the murder of rushed anymore.

710
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,200
Um,
how nice.

711
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:34,380
Nice icer them,
that's a freezing and unfreezing 

712
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,130
relations,
uh,

713
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,770
but,
but the point I wanted to make was it,

714
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,590
that's again,
we've all,

715
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,630
we've been through these things.
We know how it plays out with the 

716
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,170
Charlie Hebdo,
uh,

717
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,290
events,
the murder of the staff and contributors

718
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:54,291
to that magazine.
We knew in the immediate aftermath what 

719
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:58,461
was going on and that,
that there were people who just wanted 

720
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:00,660
to make excuses and you still hear that 
everywhere.

721
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,770
I mean,
I,

722
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:05,970
I've heard it on every single free 
speech debate in my adult life.

723
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Um,
I remember growing up and I remember in 

724
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,921
every one of the things in recent years 
from the Danish cartoons to the Julia 

725
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:20,790
Medina scandal,
a publisher London's firebombed for 

726
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,300
publishing a novel.

727
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,480
It was actually amazingly phoning about 
Mohammed,

728
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,180
uh,
to charlene abdomen since you,

729
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,300
you just get these,
this strange group of people from 

730
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,571
brightened left some believers and 
nonbelievers who always just come up 

731
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:39,660
with these bullshit bullshit arguments 
and say things like,

732
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,090
well,
I didn't find the cartoon very funny.

733
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:43,410
Or,
or I never,

734
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:46,200
I never took that magazine seriously 
awhile.

735
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,740
I didn't think it was right when they 
did this and it just,

736
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,950
they just don't,
for some reason have the fortitude to 

737
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,650
just say the only thing that matters in 
the wake of that,

738
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:56,580
which is no.

739
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,800
Do you think that's because Islam is 
unique in their approach to anything 

740
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,670
that goes outside the lines of what they
feel is.

741
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:12,990
Oh,
absolutely acceptable in terms of like 

742
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:12,990
they will murder you if you draw 
Muhammad.

743
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:12,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

744
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:13,460
This is,
this is,

745
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,670
this is what's been described as the 
internalization of the fat.

746
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,890
Um,
if,

747
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,750
if,
uh,

748
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,180
I'm sure you've had this experience,
but it's actually worse now,

749
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,640
the presumption is worse than the actual
reality.

750
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,860
I have quite often people say to me now,
I'd like to write this piece about Hex,

751
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,840
but I don't know if I can because you 
know,

752
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:37,360
it might get a death sentence.
And actually I always say,

753
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,070
what are you talking about?
Right.

754
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,120
It fortunately,
so far I haven't given that advice in 

755
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,580
the person's him being in any way under 
any actual danger lambien killed.

756
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,730
Right?
But,

757
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,400
and I think I might feel differently if 
that was the case.

758
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,650
Um,
but,

759
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:54,520
uh,
but that,

760
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,550
but there is this,
an overcompensation occurring at the 

761
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,200
moment and it goes far,
far within the,

762
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,520
within the boundaries of what actually 
could plausibly get you into any trouble

763
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,890
whether or not the trouble is,
you know,

764
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,270
legitimate to get into or not.

765
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,970
Um,
so that now,

766
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
yeah,
I've had many journalists in recent 

767
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,280
years,
particularly since shiny objects will 

768
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,280
sidle up to me and say,
well,

769
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I'd quite like to do this for,
I don't,

770
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,850
I don't dare.
And,

771
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:25,870
and you know,
I mean I'm talking about for like very 

772
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,110
basic reporting and things that they're 
not people saying,

773
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,330
hey,
I decided to draw a great big cartoon of

774
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:30,940
Mohammed with a great big dick.
And uh,

775
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:32,110
you know,
uh,

776
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,100
having sex with the pope or something.
You know,

777
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,360
it's not that,
it's never that.

778
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,130
It's never people saying,
I'm really just so keen to draw Mohammed

779
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:42,820
today.
Douglas,

780
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:44,740
what did I do?
It never is that.

781
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:46,210
It's always something way,
way,

782
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:51,211
way down.
I'm thinking of even like saying 

783
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:53,860
something critical if sense and regimes.
So,

784
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,290
so the internalization of the fat ones 
since 1989,

785
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,530
which has been exacerbated now by the 
killings,

786
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:02,350
the Charlie Hebdo and as well the 
attacks on the unit as Boston in Denmark

787
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,380
means that we are in this period where,
where people are really hyper 

788
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,130
hypersensitive and they really shouldn't
be because it really isn't that bad.

789
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,560
It's not as bad as they think.
But this is,

790
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:17,500
you know,
you can do so much work if you,

791
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,630
if you say to people,
I've got Kalashnikovs on my side,

792
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,890
I mean the extent and people in free 
societies.

793
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,190
I got really,
really loathe to admit this,

794
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,910
but it's the classic is a classic sort 
of a mob trek,

795
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:35,770
you know,
knocking on someone's door.

796
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,940
I'm very disappointed in you,
but my friend,

797
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,580
my huge friend,
uh,

798
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:47,850
is a,
is a really angry and I'm just holding 

799
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,941
him back.
You can do an amazing amount of work if 

800
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:54,181
you're willing to pull that trick.
And if you can persuade people and it's 

801
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:57,040
actually the case that there are people 
you're holding back,

802
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,790
that you can make enormous inroads like 
that.

803
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:00,940
Well,

804
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:05,950
especially when there's actual evidence 
that people have been murdered and 

805
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:05,950
happened.
Absolutely.

806
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,210
One of the more fascinating things about
Charlie Hebdo to me was the refusal of 

807
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,860
any of the mainstream media to show any 
of the cartoons.

808
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:17,861
Yes.
You had to go online and I felt like 

809
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:17,900
this was a.
They gave up the reins of information to

810
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:22,901
the Internet when it was,
was a real transitionary moment in our 

811
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:23,090
culture.
Yes.

812
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:24,500
Everyone went online to see what.
Yeah,

813
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,380
the only place to go pump from your 
parents,

814
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:32,381
you know,
they were still under the impression 

815
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:34,541
that these must be incredibly 
pornographic cartoons that were really 

816
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:34,541
viciously attacking

817
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:36,980
somebody.
But no,

818
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,640
most anyone young can.
I could find this out for themselves.

819
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,670
And you're right,
they,

820
00:41:41,671 --> 00:41:43,070
they,
they gave up the,

821
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:44,960
uh,
the space to the net and they all,

822
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,250
they all had,
again,

823
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:49,400
these sort of rubbishy I arguments that 
their own about it.

824
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:51,540
I tried in Britain to,
uh,

825
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,560
get the press to do it at one go and a 
couple of days after the massacre and,

826
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,010
um,
got pretty close,

827
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,780
uh,
that if everyone's there.

828
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,700
So I am spartacus tactic.
If everyone did it at once,

829
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:12,701
then it'll be okay,
but it would make it easier and the 

830
00:42:12,701 --> 00:42:14,840
argument you always get about that is,
and is a very persuasive argument,

831
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:19,841
is that the editor of the magazine or 
newspaper might get protection.

832
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,780
So,
but you know,

833
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,440
a girl from the typing pool sort of 
thing and the,

834
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,170
which is what happened actually in some 
of the satanic verses,

835
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,200
killings,
stabbings and things like the Norwegian 

836
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,200
translate with Japanese translator,
you know,

837
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,980
it's people who under no security 
protocol could possibly end up or 

838
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,040
getting protected.
Uh,

839
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:46,210
and,
and on the basis of fearing that the 

840
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:46,820
boss who almost always says no,

841
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:52,490
one of the more uniquely American 
responses to the Charlie Hebdo attack 

842
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,510
was they had a drama Mohammed contest in
Texas.

843
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,890
Yes,
I followed that.

844
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,060
Yeah.
That was fascinating.

845
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:02,330
And some guy showed up and started 
shooting at the building and they were 

846
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,750
killed almost immediately.
Yes.

847
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,780
Which is because they're in Texas and 
that's just not the place to fuck 

848
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:08,780
around.

849
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,970
Although,
I mean,

850
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,990
it's worth mentioning with,
I mean the,

851
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
the,
the editor at Charlie Hebdo had police 

852
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,000
protection in Paris and they just,
I mean,

853
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,250
I suppose they were not worth dwelling 
or better than the,

854
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,870
they,
uh,

855
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,000
the,
the,

856
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:27,210
the battle trained people who were sent 
from Yemen to carry out that operation.

857
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,940
We just were better prepared than the 
French authorities realized.

858
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,250
Um,

859
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:39,030
very few people are really ready to 
militarize cartoonist offices.

860
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,460
And that's really almost what you would 
have to do.

861
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:45,940
You would have to have navy seals of 
bulletproof vests.

862
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,350
Yes.
And then packed and loaded.

863
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,540
And then let's face it,
I mean,

864
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,640
the whole thing.
Then you do start to question,

865
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:50,970
you know,
like,

866
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,100
well,
is this cartoon that funny?

867
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,430
So.
Yeah.

868
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,490
And that's what they actually have done 
it.

869
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,150
You have,
they have,

870
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,130
they did a little while ago,
say,

871
00:43:59,131 --> 00:44:01,590
look,
we're not gonna keep doing this.

872
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,300
Well,
didn't they have

873
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,420
Mohammed making out with someone like,
almost

874
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,450
immediately after.
That's right.

875
00:44:06,451 --> 00:44:09,180
Yeah.
But after about a year or so,

876
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:09,670
they,
the,

877
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:14,671
they stopped.
They said they didn't want to do 

878
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:14,671
Mohammed again.
And,

879
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:14,900
uh,
and uh,

880
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,290
and you can't blame them.
I mean,

881
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,780
this is the thing,
isn't that a,

882
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,680
I'm sure you have this experience in 
these sorts of time.

883
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,600
I,
I always get people on the,

884
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:29,601
apart from the Turkish donkey porn guy,
other people on twitter send me things 

885
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:29,601
like,
you know,

886
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:34,220
well,
why don't you draw Mohammed sort of 

887
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,220
stuff.
Sure.

888
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,430
And first of all,
I mean I'm,

889
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,030
I'm,
I'm not a cartoonist,

890
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,060
but secondly,
the way in which this is always 

891
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,760
presented is amazing because it's always
fun.

892
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,290
Like Xena,
Warrior,

893
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,970
Princess Twelve,
93,

894
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,620
you don't have the guts to draw Mohammed
Mary and you know,

895
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:53,690
like,
well you don't even know the guts of 

896
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:53,690
your own name on twitter mate.
So,

897
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:53,840
uh,
uh,

898
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:54,660
but,
but there's,

899
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,280
there's a bit of,
of egging along.

900
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,740
What happens in those cases?

901
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,910
I don't want to draw Mohammed,
I don't want to Piss people off by 

902
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,761
drawing the cartoon.
But what I do want to point out is that 

903
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:07,761
you,
if you,

904
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:11,210
if you don't defend people's rights to 
draw things without getting murdered.

905
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,760
Yes.
And you're living in an insane society.

906
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,020
Yeah.

907
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,560
And,
and the,

908
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,360
there's another thing we said,
we all know what comes next.

909
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,420
I mean,
my point about this has always been 

910
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:24,670
think of something smaller than a 
cartoon to do,

911
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,320
right?
I mean,

912
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:31,321
I still reserve the right to be amazed.
We call something a cartoon crisis and 

913
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:33,220
keep a straight face.
You know,

914
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,750
we're going to have to militarize in 
Garland,

915
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:37,690
Texas because there's a cartoon crisis.
Well known

916
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,820
natural progression could easily be 
your.

917
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:45,850
You're not allowed to draw the cartoon.
Then from there you're not allowed to 

918
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:50,351
speak of drawing.
And then from there you have to show 

919
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:55,750
that you have a very certain idea in 
your head of what is good and one is 

920
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:59,261
bad.
So you have to show that by verbalizing 

921
00:45:59,261 --> 00:46:01,301
something.
So you're forced to forced to verbalize 

922
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:01,301
something.

923
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,030
And let's face it,
it's not as if it's just the cartoon.

924
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:04,430
That's the problem is it?
I mean,

925
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,890
it's a novel,
it's short,

926
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,060
so on and so forth.
Sandy phone.

927
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,760
And that's one of my big beefs about 
this is that a,

928
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,560
I don't want to not say what I think is 
true and even if that does offend,

929
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,160
you know,
one point three or 4 billion people,

930
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:24,610
it is often said and tones that are not 
entirely unthreatening.

931
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,770
Uh,
if,

932
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:27,510
if,
uh,

933
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:32,530
Charlie Hebdo or somebody else can't 
draw a cartoon of Muhammad and then I 

934
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,970
know that exactly in tandem with that is
somebody saying,

935
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,800
and you douglas or you,
Joe,

936
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:39,310
you,
anyone else can say what you find in the

937
00:46:39,311 --> 00:46:44,210
texts or what you think about this 
religion and you can join the rest of,

938
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:49,090
uh,
of the society and being brave and going

939
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,480
to the book of Mormon on a Friday night 
for a laugh is a laugh.

940
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,960
But don't you dare think of applying to 
Islam the same kind of speech you would 

941
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:01,960
apply to mormonism.
And that,

942
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,670
that I,
that I won't do,

943
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,890
I just,
I just weren't joining in on that.

944
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,400
And um,
despite there being a price to pay for 

945
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,380
that,
but I just wouldn't not say what I think

946
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:15,610
is true in these matters.

947
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,770
Are you aware of what they did with 
South Park?

948
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:23,830
With South Park South Park?
It got very crazy were they not only 

949
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:28,691
could not draw Muhammad,
they couldn't draw Muhammad in a bear 

950
00:47:28,691 --> 00:47:33,191
suit,
so then they have Mohammed in a bear 

951
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:36,790
suit in an armored car,
so you couldn't even see him,

952
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:41,791
but it was implied that Muhammad was 
inside the armored car in a bear suit 

953
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:42,940
and it's still.

954
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,540
But they did my homies voice,
didn't they?

955
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,810
Yeah,
they.

956
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,000
They gave him a screwy voice.
Great Voice.

957
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:54,001
So that was a kid.
As long as you joke about the voice of 

958
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:54,001
Muhammad,
you okay,

959
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:54,410
but don't you dare show him.
It's fucking insane.

960
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:59,330
It's really weird as well because again,
they all make presumptions.

961
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:04,331
It's just not true.
It's not true that nobody ever drew 

962
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:04,490
Mohammed.
It's not true.

963
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,880
There are illustrations in books that 
are still on sale of very old 

964
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,540
illustrations Mohammed through 
throughout Islamic history.

965
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:12,890
That's before they knew better,
bro.

966
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,370
Didn't know better,
but got a new note from Mohammed.

967
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:17,210
Mohammed is like,
look,

968
00:48:17,211 --> 00:48:21,950
I don't like these fucking drawings.
Me and not about killing people.

969
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,000
They don't show my best side,
and this is,

970
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,850
this is,
this is a very strange position to be in

971
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:31,220
because South Park ends up holding the 
line.

972
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:35,570
Then south park,
it's like fat tire against South Bucket.

973
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:37,130
What?
I didn't see that headline coming.

974
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,840
Um,
and again,

975
00:48:38,841 --> 00:48:40,670
everyone internalizes it and everyone 
thinks,

976
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:41,300
well,
you know,

977
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:42,190
I,
I,

978
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,920
I admire them in the Mormon work,
but I wouldn't follow them.

979
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:47,540
And then Mohammed works.
So,

980
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:52,320
and then the whole culture tilts it.
Um,

981
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:57,670
and that's,
that's I think where we are at the 

982
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:57,670
moment on this.
And I,

983
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:57,670
uh,
I just,

984
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,230
you know,
the cartoon will never be funny enough.

985
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,380
The joke will never be funny enough.
A novel will never be good enough and so

986
00:49:03,381 --> 00:49:03,800
on.
And,

987
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:08,630
and then in the end the speech will 
never be worth speaking enough.

988
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,150
I,
I,

989
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:12,290
a little while ago had a very clear 
experience of this.

990
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:17,291
I read about it on the radio in Britain 
where I was in discussion with a Muslim 

991
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:21,341
cleric who was sort of reformist 
figuring meyer in some ways who in a 

992
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:24,260
discussion about something said,
well,

993
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:27,080
you know,
also Muhammad Prophet Muhammad,

994
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:27,800
peace be upon him.

995
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,260
Was,
was he took criticism in his and he took

996
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,550
criticism very,
very well.

997
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,410
He never mind that.
People criticizing him.

998
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,900
I was like,
that's absolute crap.

999
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,970
That is real crap.
I mean,

1000
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,390
whatever else you can say.
He Mohammed not really good on this,

1001
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:50,460
on the criticism of himself bit.
And I gave an example of a female 

1002
00:49:50,661 --> 00:49:55,661
protests who he had killed because she 
criticized him and this guy went 

1003
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:59,300
absolutely ape shit and refused to 
continue and so on.

1004
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:04,330
And because you gave an actual 
historical example from his own 

1005
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:09,010
religious texts and uh,
and in the end it was a prerecorded CNN,

1006
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,910
the BBC,
I can this,

1007
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,830
can you find another way of trying to 
make the same point and you know,

1008
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,520
and,
and that was what we had to do.

1009
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:23,360
Another way of making the same point 
rather than pointing out the historical 

1010
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,220
pxe that showed that Mohammed did have a
female poet killed.

1011
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,980
Yes.
You just one other

1012
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,630
way.
Would there be to make that point?

1013
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:32,720
That is hard,
but that's the ultimate way to make that

1014
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:33,440
point.
Exactly.

1015
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:36,260
Which is by pointing to the texts and 
the facts.

1016
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:41,290
But you know,
I can think of no other situation in 

1017
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,760
which somebody has veto rights like 
that.

1018
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,320
Yeah.
In a normal discussion.

1019
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,350
And it's because they are terrified of 
the retaliation.

1020
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:47,720
So,
I mean,

1021
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:49,700
I knew everyone in the production box 
was like,

1022
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,880
oh no,
what's Douglas Dunn?

1023
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:57,030
So how can we stop it affecting us?
What was this clerics response to that 

1024
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,740
he.
Yeah,

1025
00:50:57,741 --> 00:50:58,120
he,
he,

1026
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:58,960
he,
uh,

1027
00:50:59,410 --> 00:50:59,840
went.
Yeah,

1028
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:04,841
there's a bit nuts and wouldn't continue
unless I wouldn't say that.

1029
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,380
And so what did he deny that it was?
Oh yeah.

1030
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,210
I said I was making it up and I was a 
liar.

1031
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,340
I'm used to that,
but that,

1032
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:19,510
that's a crazy thing for him to say when
someone could just read the text.

1033
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:24,930
Yeah.
But they were banking on nobody doing 

1034
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:24,930
that.
Well,

1035
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:25,300
not this day and age.
Don't bank on that.

1036
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:25,960
Yeah,
I.

1037
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:27,760
This is.
This is one of the releasing things,

1038
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:29,170
isn't it?
Because although it's true,

1039
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:32,770
you can suppress a lot of this.
You know,

1040
00:51:32,771 --> 00:51:37,771
we do live in an age when basically 
anyone can google and find texts and 

1041
00:51:37,771 --> 00:51:39,460
they can just find a time that a billion
people have read.

1042
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,500
I'm not sure they've read it,
but yeah.

1043
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,210
Well possess it.
How many people you think read it?

1044
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,970
How many people you think read the 
Bible?

1045
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:51,390
Like if you had like,
guess there are a number of Christians 

1046
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,301
in this country.
All those tests aren't that they'd 

1047
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:57,290
sometimes to the humanists sudden did a 
few years ago asking very basic 

1048
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:01,890
questions of self professed Christians 
about their knowledge of the texts and 

1049
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:05,620
very few.
My favorite is self professed Christians

1050
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:08,140
with religious tattoos.
Like,

1051
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:10,060
hey man,
you got to read the whole book.

1052
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,960
Like you are literally showing on your 
skin that you didn't read the whole 

1053
00:52:16,361 --> 00:52:21,361
book.
It didn't pay attention to don't do 

1054
00:52:21,361 --> 00:52:21,361
that.

1055
00:52:21,361 --> 00:52:23,200
This is Leviticus,
leviticus.

1056
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:25,450
It says that it's got the implications 
against the writing.

1057
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:29,450
I say if you read limited,
there's a heck of a lot you can't do.

1058
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:29,820
If you.
If,

1059
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:35,170
if you go down Leviticus,
I can't wear two pieces of different 

1060
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:35,170
cloth.
Yes,

1061
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:35,890
exactly.
Yeah.

1062
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,910
Leviticus is a wonderful book.
It's going to be.

1063
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:42,970
It's very good for them because what?
The Vegas wasn't the one which was the 

1064
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:47,251
book where the guy.
I'm called upon the sheet bear to kill 

1065
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:48,730
the children who were mocking his 
baldness.

1066
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,790
Do you know about that one?
My favorite special bald guy.

1067
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,440
This guy was getting mocked by children 
fucking kids and God called upon a.

1068
00:53:01,921 --> 00:53:06,921
She bear to come down and tear apart 
these children who were making fun of 

1069
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:08,960
his bald head here.
Oh,

1070
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,030
oh shit.
And the to bear to kings.

1071
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,280
Yeah.
Look at that.

1072
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,360
Wow.
Went up to pat.

1073
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,020
If you are going to intervene in human 
affairs for anything,

1074
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:24,021
this would be the time when God's got to
step in this kind of stuff.

1075
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:25,980
Going young kids,

1076
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,070
young kids came out from the city and 
mocked him and said to him,

1077
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,370
go up you bald head.
Go up you bald head,

1078
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:37,371
which is very mild,
and when he looked behind him and saw 

1079
00:53:37,371 --> 00:53:39,870
them,
he cursed them in the name of the Lord,

1080
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:44,871
all caps than two female bears came out 
of the woods and tore up 42 lads have 

1081
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:49,740
their number and he went from there to 
Mount Carmel.

1082
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:51,510
It's like no big deal.
It's over.

1083
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,250
Got It done.
And that's,

1084
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:53,700
that's.

1085
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,820
Yeah,
that's my favorite reading from 

1086
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,970
scripture was about the end of one of 
the books that come in.

1087
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:04,971
Which one?
It was over the course when I was young 

1088
00:54:04,971 --> 00:54:05,940
and I always made me laugh if there was 
a destruction of the city of Nineveh.

1089
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:11,540
It finished,
I think not any finish this chapter of 

1090
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:11,540
the book,
he says,

1091
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:11,540
you know,
and,

1092
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,350
and low in that,
in that city where

1093
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:18,660
40,000
human souls that were destroyed and had 

1094
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,191
also some cattle cattle just by 
association,

1095
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,690
some cattle,
bad cows.

1096
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,530
There are bad cows.
God had a fuck up those cows too.

1097
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,130
But no,
the um,

1098
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,870
the bald headed one.
That's,

1099
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,590
that's,
that's uh,

1100
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:34,860
yeah,
that's a heck of a time to,

1101
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,390
to tread into him to,
in an insult,

1102
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,480
you know,
had your bald head is just an accurate 

1103
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:42,790
description.
I mean that is not an insult.

1104
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,980
If you like,
you ugly,

1105
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,160
sloppy,
baldheaded loser.

1106
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,310
Okay.
Then maybe God needs to step in and send

1107
00:54:51,311 --> 00:54:56,311
some wolves to attack yet.
And why do they specify that they're 

1108
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:56,311
female?
Yeah.

1109
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,230
Why is it female 30 to have that number?
Yeah.

1110
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:02,740
Forty two kids.
Two bears head.

1111
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,050
Those are some bitch ass kids need to 
learn how to run.

1112
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:10,710
That doesn't even make sense.
How the fuck those bears even catch all 

1113
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:10,930
42 of those kids.
What kind of kids they raised over there

1114
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,220
in Bethel.
Alright.

1115
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,840
Shouldn't get the fuck out of there.
Well,

1116
00:55:16,841 --> 00:55:21,841
they're all sitting around waiting their
turn mean trying out curse words to 

1117
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:26,170
causes the best to come down you shaggy 
bear.

1118
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,480
That didn't work.
You Shaggy.

1119
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,730
Mangy.
Dirty,

1120
00:55:30,731 --> 00:55:33,030
stinky,
bare bulb.

1121
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:39,330
Yeah.
There's so many of those stories that 

1122
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:39,330
are so strange.

1123
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:39,330
I bet.
I bet that most,

1124
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,480
if we,
if we were to go to the,

1125
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:44,650
the people who say that that question is
in the polls and ask them about,

1126
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,200
we don't even need to go to the bolthead
bad.

1127
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:53,550
They don't accept that.
Most people don't even bother reading 

1128
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:53,560
that because it's just,
it's almost too crazy.

1129
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:54,430
Yeah.
But,

1130
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,110
uh,
but,

1131
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:56,470
uh,
but I'm very,

1132
00:55:56,471 --> 00:55:58,570
very little knowledge even about very 
basic things.

1133
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,670
Um,
uh,

1134
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,370
you know,
even commandments and so on.

1135
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,720
So that's the case with the religion 
that in America and Britain is known 

1136
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,321
best with Christianity.
So there's no reason to assume that 

1137
00:56:12,321 --> 00:56:12,321
that's not the case with Islam as well.
Isn't

1138
00:56:12,321 --> 00:56:12,850
that just the case with people?
I mean,

1139
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:15,310
it seems to be the same thing that we're
talking about with headlines.

1140
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:20,490
Someone reads a headlines,
they don't bother reading into it and 

1141
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:20,490
then they accuse someone of something.
It's almost like with religion,

1142
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,540
I'm a Christian and I'm a Christian man.
Oh really?

1143
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,980
Please me about the Bible,

1144
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,340
right?

1145
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:26,790
Uh Huh.

1146
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,380
Yeah.
That's something I've often thought.

1147
00:56:30,381 --> 00:56:35,381
This is one of the reasons why it's 
possible to get a sudden fanaticism 

1148
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:39,071
going within Muslim communities on some 
issues to do with best for me is I think

1149
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,360
is to do with,
uh,

1150
00:56:41,361 --> 00:56:46,361
a realization of this.
You said that this was the case about 

1151
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:48,920
our prophet.
I didn't know that.

1152
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:53,590
I know he did what I had all my adult 
life with,

1153
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,270
with,
uh,

1154
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:59,290
arguing with Muslims about things the,
they very rarely know for the problems 

1155
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,700
in their own tradition.
And when you bring them up,

1156
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,450
they're like,
what the,

1157
00:57:05,451 --> 00:57:07,890
what he did,
what a,

1158
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:13,050
like the Christians with the bold bets.
And this causes a really serious problem

1159
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:18,851
for them because they are told from the 
cradle that the,

1160
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:24,350
that they are following a religion 
founded by the most perfect man 

1161
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:25,850
imaginable.
And if you discover that,

1162
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,180
if you know there's no description of 
Helen,

1163
00:57:29,181 --> 00:57:32,720
of troy in ancient text,
why does nobody described handled?

1164
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,260
Why doesn't it reset the unit?
She was so you had this beautiful blonde

1165
00:57:36,261 --> 00:57:39,650
ringlets order is because it actually 
catches on as a,

1166
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,110
as a theme because everyone makes Helen 
of troy,

1167
00:57:42,111 --> 00:57:45,310
their most beautiful woman.
If you start describing,

1168
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,720
you'd be like,
I'm not into red heads.

1169
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:54,070
Everyone would write hello toy becomes a
person upon whom you put all of those 

1170
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:57,320
things and in the same way Mohammed 
becomes,

1171
00:57:57,321 --> 00:57:59,270
if you say,
is the perfect human being,

1172
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:04,810
people will just throw their lives,
put the kinds of things they think are 

1173
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:04,810
perfect onto Mohammed.
You must have been very kind,

1174
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,970
very generous,
very caregiving,

1175
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:08,780
and so on,
so that if you then say,

1176
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:11,300
well,
what about when he vented this?

1177
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:17,260
I think it just causes an extra hurt.
This is something we'll have to get 

1178
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:17,450
over,
of course,

1179
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:22,010
because we can't go away and not 
identify these,

1180
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,420
these issues.
Um,

1181
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,700
but it causes in the short term and 
enormous,

1182
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
enormous pain.
I have an example I gave recently in a 

1183
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,000
book of,
um,

1184
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,170
somebody I spent some time with a couple
years ago to extraordinary man called 

1185
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,110
morten storm.
Um,

1186
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,790
he was a Danish biker,
a big in a biker gang in Denmark.

1187
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,510
I went to prison and in prison about 
$2,000.

1188
00:58:44,511 --> 00:58:48,290
So he converted to Islam.
He converted to Al Qaeda.

1189
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,630
Basically.
He's not a,

1190
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:53,510
not a common person in any way,
and uh,

1191
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,440
he ended up being the main go to person 
for some of our luck.

1192
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,620
He was the head of al Qaeda in Yemen and
in fact was asked to give him a,

1193
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:07,650
get a wife our lucky to supplement his 
wife collection and a modesto among 

1194
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:13,291
other things,
ended up falling out with our kid and 

1195
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:16,000
ended up working for the CIA and Danish 
intelligence and ended up helping lead 

1196
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,040
them to our lucky who was then droned by
Obama in 2011 or so.

1197
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,990
Anyhow,
I said to motor storm,

1198
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,330
what was the moment that made you get 
out of Al Qaeda?

1199
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:28,850
And he has such a fascinating on.
So he,

1200
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:33,950
he,
he came out of al Qaeda and Islam the 

1201
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:33,950
same moment.

1202
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:34,640
He says what was happening was he was 
sitting in his,

1203
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:40,080
he was waiting for a package when kind 
of drop off to get them from him to our 

1204
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,850
lucky and the,
the,

1205
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:46,880
the person carrying the package was late
and then really late and he was sitting 

1206
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:49,250
in his apartment somewhere in Germany I 
think at that point.

1207
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:54,730
And he was so pissed off about this and 
he had a laptop that was there on the 

1208
00:59:55,131 --> 01:00:00,131
table and he thought basically,
how can I express my pissed off with my 

1209
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,940
al Qaeda colleagues for wasting my time 
like this so much.

1210
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:09,941
And he went to Google and typed in 
contradictions in Islam and began to 

1211
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:11,480
read.

1212
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,920
Wow.
That was how he got out.

1213
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,410
Wow.
That's what did him in.

1214
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,050
Someone's being late.
He just started reading again.

1215
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,320
They told me this,
they never told me that.

1216
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,200
I never knew that.
And that was.

1217
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,060
So.
As I say,

1218
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:29,680
he's a very,
very uncommon.

1219
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:36,010
But,
but I think that might be happening 

1220
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,080
quite a lot more than we know people.
Just googling things,

1221
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:40,700
finding stuff out for themselves.
It's the most dangerous route.

1222
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,920
Religion to leave because they kill 
apostates.

1223
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,280
I do.
Yeah.

1224
01:00:45,281 --> 01:00:48,150
So how is he dealing with that?
Well,

1225
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,230
he,
he lives in hidings.

1226
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,650
I mean.
Wow.

1227
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:51,370
Yeah.

1228
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,100
Yeah.
We didn't see me.

1229
01:00:54,101 --> 01:00:57,670
He wrote a book called agents dorm about
it two years ago.

1230
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:04,140
One of the weirdest conversation that I 
ever saw anybody have with someone who 

1231
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,741
is a believer was Dawkins.
I think it was was having a conversation

1232
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:13,531
with someone and he asked him point 
blank whether or not he believed that 

1233
01:01:13,531 --> 01:01:14,290
Mohammed split the moon.
Oh yes.

1234
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:20,100
I think I know this was with Vaco is 
enemy of mine called Media Hassan who 

1235
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,630
worked for Al Jazeera and who Richard 
Dawkins did an interview with and I 

1236
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:28,861
think he,
that's why he fluffed something earlier 

1237
01:01:28,861 --> 01:01:31,840
on a dog is that he didn't take it on.
Then he took him on this.

1238
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:34,620
That's right.
And I think that Sun City,

1239
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,270
yes,
yes,

1240
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:40,710
yes.
And then it lead to this terrible 

1241
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:41,320
problem which is really interesting and 
distinct problem of our era,

1242
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:42,940
which is then dog.
He said,

1243
01:01:42,941 --> 01:01:44,620
I can't believe that somebody or said 
afterwards,

1244
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:47,500
I can't believe that somebody can be a 
working journalist and believe that,

1245
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,460
you know,
Mohammed slipped and half human horse.

1246
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,140
Right.
Um,

1247
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:58,110
and of course,
I mean that's an interesting point 

1248
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:01,381
there,
but of course we do quite rightly allow 

1249
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:01,381
people to believe

1250
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:05,490
bizarre and insane thing that 
Christianity was bizarre.

1251
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:10,491
Exactly.
And if we started saying you can't have 

1252
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:12,471
public office or work in journalism,
if you profess to be of this particular 

1253
01:02:12,471 --> 01:02:12,570
then,
but we wouldn't get anyway.

1254
01:02:12,571 --> 01:02:15,000
We wouldn't have anyone left.
And how does the story go?

1255
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:18,910
Mohammed flew to the moon on a half 
human horse and split the moon with a.

1256
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:21,020
is that what he did?
I can't remember.

1257
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,520
He could have then been attacked by 
female beds,

1258
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:24,860
but I can't remember.
No,

1259
01:02:24,861 --> 01:02:25,740
I can't.
Yes,

1260
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:29,730
he gets the night journey,
which is a central.

1261
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,740
Has the moon get glued back together 
again?

1262
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,920
Is it glued back together?
It looks like it is.

1263
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:40,370
I haven't looked close.
Maybe I need to pay more attention to 

1264
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,740
the fact that a,
I,

1265
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:48,080
I believe this was a few years ago,
let's just say it was 2010 that this 

1266
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,711
interview or the debate took place 
around them eight years ago that someone

1267
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,450
would be comfortable saying,
oh,

1268
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:55,970
that they believe that,
oh,

1269
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:56,370
let me see.

1270
01:02:56,370 --> 01:03:01,370
I got into a little bit of trouble.
Richard Dawkins got a bit annoyed about 

1271
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:01,370
me,
uh,

1272
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:05,700
because I took the mickey out of him for
dodging the one earlier in that it was 

1273
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:05,820
the earlier one.
He,

1274
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:08,160
I'm a great admirer of Richard,
uh,

1275
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,080
is everyone is sure.
But,

1276
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,150
um,
he,

1277
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,390
he knows exactly where the cliff edge 
is.

1278
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:19,100
And in that interview he,
uh,

1279
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,680
he was asked on allergies era by this 
interview.

1280
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:26,160
He see read out the bit from the God 
delusion about,

1281
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,280
uh,
as a great bit of rhetoric about the 

1282
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,570
most,
the swipes God is something like the 

1283
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:34,570
most appalling,
narcissistic,

1284
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:34,680
murderous,
blah,

1285
01:03:34,681 --> 01:03:35,010
blah,
blah.

1286
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:38,520
Character in all of fiction is a 
terrific piece of writing.

1287
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,070
And the interviewer says to you,
you,

1288
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:42,900
uh,
you,

1289
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:48,160
you stand by.
That was the description of the 

1290
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:48,160
Christian.
God says,

1291
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:48,160
yes.
He says,

1292
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:48,600
use it as a description of the Jewish.

1293
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,830
God says yes.
Then he says,

1294
01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:51,840
and what do you say?
The same thing about the Muslim God.

1295
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:55,170
And I just knew exactly what's 
happening.

1296
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,500
And Richard Dawkins says about the 
Muslim God,

1297
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,700
I didn't know so much,
which he,

1298
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,500
as I say,
he,

1299
01:04:02,501 --> 01:04:02,910
he,
he,

1300
01:04:02,911 --> 01:04:05,280
he,
he thinks I shouldn't rip him on this.

1301
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,920
And the thing was,
what I noticed was just,

1302
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:12,921
I just,
I completely felt it's been very brave 

1303
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:15,591
and brilliant writer and thinker on 
these matters and nobody's done more in 

1304
01:04:15,591 --> 01:04:16,560
some ways,
but he,

1305
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:20,940
I knew exactly what was happening.
He was staring right over the cliff edge

1306
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:26,090
and somebody was behind him,
nudging and that if he had said,

1307
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,590
as it were,
live on Al Jazeera,

1308
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,690
Oh yes,
Allah,

1309
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,760
you know,
the total bastard,

1310
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:35,480
then I,
you know,

1311
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:40,490
you didn't know,
maybe that's maybe your then in real 

1312
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:40,490
trouble,
you know.

1313
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:45,560
And so he stepped back from the brink 
and I rather cruelly perhaps taking the 

1314
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:45,700
mickey out of him afterward.

1315
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:50,720
I said that it was just the,
Richard Dawkins was demonstrating the 

1316
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,531
survival instinct of his species.
But I feel bad about it,

1317
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:55,680
but it is true.
It is true.

1318
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:00,890
But we've all been there to some extent.
And what was his response to that 

1319
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,910
though?
To my junior criticism?

1320
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:04,560
He,
um,

1321
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:07,500
well he basically,
he,

1322
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,560
I think he did take it on board in a 
way,

1323
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,540
um,
complex reasons,

1324
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,000
but I know,
I know,

1325
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:17,290
I know he was also annoyed that I was 
where he,

1326
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:19,300
I think he felt that I was doing that to
him.

1327
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:21,580
Then you do it right.
Right,

1328
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:22,480
right.
Um,

1329
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:28,260
and that is very common in that I've had
that a lot in my life in this particular

1330
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:33,691
area of people trying to egg me over.
Why don't you say that course and uh,

1331
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:40,890
and you know that they're the people 
who'll be a million miles behind you 

1332
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:41,410
with their ears plugged.

1333
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:42,850
Yeah.
I behind a wall.

1334
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,710
I always have.
I always have a very,

1335
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:47,180
very visual aid of era.
Somebody who actually is,

1336
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:52,190
is a terrific reformer in Islam that now
under another cleric who wants to 

1337
01:05:52,711 --> 01:05:57,711
describe me.
He went to fight for the Mujahideen in 

1338
01:05:57,711 --> 01:05:59,431
Afghanistan and a study years ago now.
And describe to me that he's not a very 

1339
01:05:59,431 --> 01:06:02,200
fittingly like person,
but described how he did that to sort of

1340
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,870
rile them up to sort of run over and get
at the Soviets.

1341
01:06:04,871 --> 01:06:06,100
And he was like,
you know,

1342
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:06,980
we're all agreed.
Yes,

1343
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:12,290
yes.
And I go and he worked 20 odd guys.

1344
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,920
Yeah.
Isn't everyone else stayed in the 

1345
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,431
trench?
And I've always thought this is exactly 

1346
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:20,431
the,
uh,

1347
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:21,080
the experience of anyone.
Yeah.

1348
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,350
This area is that there's an inherent 
danger in this criticism.

1349
01:06:25,351 --> 01:06:29,040
Even this discussion right now,
I'm sure there's people right now firing

1350
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:33,600
up their webcams and writing blogs and 
tweeting and getting upset about it.

1351
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,880
It's awesome.
Any rational discussion of that 

1352
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,290
particular subject,
you could kind of get away.

1353
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,920
I mean,
I get criticism from Christians,

1354
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,720
but it's not scary,

1355
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,490
right?
Yes.

1356
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,620
That is,
that,

1357
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,570
that is a big difference at the time 
doing isn't it?

1358
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:56,980
This is this just something that's so 
important to a nuance that almost never 

1359
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,461
gets added in.
But of course we all just assume it so 

1360
01:07:01,461 --> 01:07:03,501
we don't think it's worth saying,
but we are aware that any religion or 

1361
01:07:03,501 --> 01:07:06,180
for like this could be this dangerous at
different phases.

1362
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:11,210
Yes.
Might've wanted to be in Spain in 

1363
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:13,500
certain points in the last millennium.
Sure.

1364
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,930
Um,
we might not have,

1365
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:20,931
wanted to be a Catholic center at 
certain points or Protestant descend to 

1366
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:20,931
others,
and so on and so forth.

1367
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:21,240
We all know that,
yes,

1368
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,530
it's just that at the moment that's 
pretty crescent and uh,

1369
01:07:25,531 --> 01:07:30,531
and quiet.
And of course it's less quiet here than 

1370
01:07:30,531 --> 01:07:33,411
it is in my country on condo.
Imagine the Anglican church becoming 

1371
01:07:33,411 --> 01:07:34,260
militant about anything at any point 
soon.

1372
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:39,990
A,
you do have some angry or types of 

1373
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:39,990
Christian here than we have in my 
country.

1374
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,910
And so it's easy for me to think they're
slightly less,

1375
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,440
uh,
uh,

1376
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:46,580
risky at some point in the future than 
the new might.

1377
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:51,590
But,
but it's just that we do recognize this 

1378
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:51,590
could happen elsewhere as well.
It just,

1379
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:51,590
at the moment it's,
it's,

1380
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:56,590
it's not the quakers that they really 
don't send me a death threat from one 

1381
01:07:58,171 --> 01:08:01,740
year to the next rather nice people.

1382
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:07,330
There is an inherent danger of a 
retaliation from people who are more 

1383
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:14,171
radical Christian,
that if this continues and if you see 

1384
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:18,320
more and more of more and more attacks 
from people of Muslim faith,

1385
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,680
you could possibly see a retaliation 
from people.

1386
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,890
Especially in this country,
like after nine slash 11,

1387
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:30,010
there was an extreme amount of,
of hate for Muslims and irrational hate 

1388
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:36,330
done.
Nothing wrong to the Sikhs as I 

1389
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:36,330
remember.
Yes.

1390
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:39,461
Well,
there was a lot of that out of 

1391
01:08:39,461 --> 01:08:39,461
ignorance.
They just didn't.

1392
01:08:39,461 --> 01:08:42,430
They didn't.
I mean that was the most disturbing 

1393
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,711
because Sikhs are pretty interesting 
people and the fact that they just 

1394
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,730
instantaneously with no information at 
all,

1395
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,680
no understanding out of complete 
ignorance attack them.

1396
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:52,240
Uh,
I,

1397
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,040
I have a second to no one in my 
gloominess about some of the things that

1398
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:59,470
we're going to go through in Britain and
Europe in the coming years.

1399
01:08:59,471 --> 01:09:04,471
But I recently had a reason to even more
gloomy about one aspect of it relating 

1400
01:09:05,471 --> 01:09:06,550
to this,
which is this.

1401
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:11,840
We had a three big bad terrorist attacks
last year in,

1402
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,910
uh,
in the UK,

1403
01:09:12,911 --> 01:09:16,810
including the Manchester Arena bomb.
Twenty two young people were blown up on

1404
01:09:16,811 --> 01:09:18,640
a Monday night for going to hear Ariana 
Grande Day.

1405
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,650
Um,
and uh,

1406
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:26,200
after the third of those attacks,
which was on London Bridge,

1407
01:09:26,201 --> 01:09:31,201
when a three people who are actually 
known to authorities as they generally 

1408
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:35,641
are a slash people's throats on the 
street and ran to borough market is 

1409
01:09:35,641 --> 01:09:39,400
people were drinking and stabbed.
People are shouting.

1410
01:09:39,401 --> 01:09:42,100
This is for Allah.
After the third of those attacks,

1411
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,650
it was felt like,
Oh God,

1412
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,930
is this really just got to keep 
happening?

1413
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:49,900
What are we going to do about it and 
what can we do?

1414
01:09:49,901 --> 01:09:51,730
And after the Manchester one in 
particular,

1415
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:54,550
there was this kind of thing of everyone
saying,

1416
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:57,340
apart from John Lennon's imagine there 
was the oasis hit,

1417
01:09:57,341 --> 01:10:02,341
don't look,
don't look back in anger and these 

1418
01:10:02,341 --> 01:10:05,401
themes that we weren't meant to think 
anything other than that we weren't 

1419
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,250
meant to be angry and went.
And uh,

1420
01:10:06,251 --> 01:10:11,251
then then just a terrible thing happened
from another direction,

1421
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,860
uh,
outside Finsbury Park mosque,

1422
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:19,890
which the muscular,
very troubled and bad history in London.

1423
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:25,260
I'm a guy from Wales in a van,
drives into the crowds as the milling 

1424
01:10:26,651 --> 01:10:31,651
around outside the mosque,
kills one man and enjoys a number of 

1425
01:10:31,651 --> 01:10:32,690
others.
Uh,

1426
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,030
that guy,
by the way,

1427
01:10:34,031 --> 01:10:36,790
just show how complex all this can get.
His,

1428
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,260
uh,
he was tried,

1429
01:10:38,261 --> 01:10:41,530
found guilty last month in the courts in
the UK.

1430
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:43,480
Uh,
he,

1431
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:44,770
uh,
he had been,

1432
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:49,771
he loves you very mentally deranged and 
had a history of mental illness and all 

1433
01:10:49,771 --> 01:10:51,400
that sort of thing is very often people 
do in these situations.

1434
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,200
But he,
uh,

1435
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:56,080
he had watched the BBC drama called 
three girls,

1436
01:10:56,081 --> 01:11:01,010
which is a first time that the BBC had 
really addressed the issue of the rather

1437
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:06,011
than Rochdale rape gangs.
That happened in the last decade in the 

1438
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:06,820
UK,
which is still a sore that's going on.

1439
01:11:06,821 --> 01:11:08,980
We're about 1500 girls in one town 
alone.

1440
01:11:08,981 --> 01:11:13,981
We're basically a abused by gangs,
most of them,

1441
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:17,670
mainly Pakistani men,
and it's a very,

1442
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:22,671
very ugly business partly because it was
so awful that nobody that nobody at the 

1443
01:11:22,771 --> 01:11:25,520
state and the police level and he wanted
to look into it.

1444
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:29,930
They are now the government inquiries 
that they didn't look into it so worried

1445
01:11:29,931 --> 01:11:31,890
about being called racist and 
Islamophobia console.

1446
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:36,120
The press did a lot of not being 
interested in this as well.

1447
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:40,710
Eventually after all these years of BBC 
makes a documentary called three girls,

1448
01:11:40,711 --> 01:11:45,711
about three of the girls who have 
suffered from these rape gangs and then 

1449
01:11:45,711 --> 01:11:50,330
a man in Wales sees it and get so 
enraged people say at the local pub he 

1450
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,570
was railing against the bloody Muslims 
and all this sort of thing,

1451
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:57,200
and then he hires a van and drives into 
a crowd of people outside a mosque and 

1452
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:02,600
you have this awful feeling that the BBC
didn't want to deal with the issue that 

1453
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:07,851
the program was about for years because 
it was so awful and ugly and sounded 

1454
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,550
like something made up by some kind of 
nativist,

1455
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:12,380
racist,
you know,

1456
01:12:12,381 --> 01:12:12,540
it's,
uh,

1457
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,470
it's had everything.

1458
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:16,650
Um,
and then they do.

1459
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,520
And then it turns out the member of the 
public sees it and drove the van into a 

1460
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:22,520
crowd.
I mean,

1461
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:22,520
you know,
this,

1462
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,670
this sort of couldn't get more complex.
And so I thought after that,

1463
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:27,450
okay,
maybe,

1464
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,340
maybe the,
maybe the BBC were right.

1465
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:34,820
Maybe they shouldn't.
Maybe they should cover up the gangway 

1466
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,240
per 1500 girls.
Maybe the public can't cope with it.

1467
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,900
Maybe they will get into vans now as it 
happens.

1468
01:12:39,901 --> 01:12:44,901
I know the British public,
I think fairly well and I think that 

1469
01:12:44,901 --> 01:12:45,720
that guy in Wales a very,
very unusual figure.

1470
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:50,990
I don't think it's very common.
I don't think everyone's going to do 

1471
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:50,990
that.
I don't think we're all like that wicked

1472
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,970
mad,
but I don't know.

1473
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,980
I mean,
I don't know for sure everywhere.

1474
01:12:55,981 --> 01:13:00,981
I don't know what the.
I don't know what happened in this 

1475
01:13:00,981 --> 01:13:00,981
country.
Have various other countries.

1476
01:13:00,981 --> 01:13:02,160
If there were three attacks like that in
quick succession,

1477
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:04,620
I don't know,
but this is.

1478
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:09,621
This is really.
It's just going to get complex is 

1479
01:13:09,621 --> 01:13:10,050
already complex

1480
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,660
and the response to it,
it's complex too.

1481
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:15,460
How do you,
how do you,

1482
01:13:15,461 --> 01:13:17,830
if you,
if you are a journalist,

1483
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:22,240
if you are a television channel,
how do you report on this?

1484
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:27,510
Do you think about the responsibility of
alerting someone to these actual real 

1485
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:32,071
atrocities?
It's going to force them to react on 

1486
01:13:32,071 --> 01:13:34,621
innocent people that did nothing in 
front of this mosque and the fact that 

1487
01:13:34,621 --> 01:13:37,981
these people in this mosque or somehow 
or another connected to these people 

1488
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:41,371
that did these horrible crimes just by 
virtue of the fact they're in the same 

1489
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:41,371
religion.
That's insane to.

1490
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:42,340
Yeah,
it's all insane

1491
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:45,780
to me.
The only way through it is to say,

1492
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:51,260
first I read it,
I can press all the time and I think 

1493
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:51,800
that it's worse than the British press 
in,

1494
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,870
in,
in that self appointed role of believing

1495
01:13:54,871 --> 01:13:57,750
it's task is to stand between the public
and the facts,

1496
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:59,880
you know,
and sort of negotiate between the two,

1497
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:05,720
uh,
see what they think the public can cope 

1498
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,140
with or should know,
and then feed them that I'm the American

1499
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:11,010
press teams to be rife with that.
That temptation as ours is.

1500
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:14,470
But it seems to be the only way around 
this is to not,

1501
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,560
not given to that and to try just to 
publish the fact when they happen 

1502
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,460
because it's just obviously seems to be 
much worse.

1503
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,920
We will know in political scandal what's
worse,

1504
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:28,950
the cover up.
It's always the cover up and that that 

1505
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:29,110
may be the case with all of this.
Maybe,

1506
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:34,470
maybe the,
the argument for just the papers 

1507
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,171
explaining stuff that's happened is 
maybe that's maybe that's all they can 

1508
01:14:39,011 --> 01:14:44,011
do and that it won't be just say to them
it'd be a lot worse if you bottled this 

1509
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:49,591
up because otherwise people will get the
idea that there is some conspiracy to 

1510
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,470
cover over certain stories and they'll 
be onto something.

1511
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:58,800
In fact,
if you think about the millions of 

1512
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,271
people that must have seen that the 
story on the grape of 1500,

1513
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:06,151
the fact that only one person responded 
that way is pretty extraordinary in and 

1514
01:15:06,151 --> 01:15:06,151
of itself.

1515
01:15:06,151 --> 01:15:06,790
Yes,
yes.

1516
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:07,600
I,
I would've,

1517
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:09,680
I would've thought on some of this.
I mean,

1518
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,220
you know,
I don't know.

1519
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,100
Again,
I mean there are,

1520
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:15,400
there are lots of examples aren't good 
use,

1521
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:20,260
but when something bad happens,
like the Manchester Arena attack,

1522
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:21,340
uh,
I'm,

1523
01:15:21,341 --> 01:15:24,940
I'm amazed in a way that people are so 
decent.

1524
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,470
I mean,
I'm so pleased they are,

1525
01:15:26,471 --> 01:15:27,910
but they,
we really,

1526
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:31,000
we don't go out looking for people to 
attack,

1527
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:31,690
you know,
the,

1528
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:32,740
the,
the public.

1529
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:35,300
Certainly in Britain I can happily send,
I think it's the same in America public,

1530
01:15:35,301 --> 01:15:39,820
but we were not really lynch mobs 
waiting to be got going again,

1531
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:45,660
but the expectation that we are,
is there any possibility of creating us 

1532
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:46,610
in such a way?
Um,

1533
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:52,230
it's only by treating us as if we can't 
deal with ugly things that go on the,

1534
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:57,250
you could see the situations where he 
began to see the situation in which that

1535
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:58,780
all goes wrong in that different way.

1536
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:04,290
Yeah.
I mean I don't envy their position,

1537
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,870
especially trying to pick up the ball 
from here.

1538
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,160
Yes.
With all the history and all the 

1539
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,541
terrible things,
especially in England with so many 

1540
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:17,751
attacks over such a relatively short 
period of time where there was a very 

1541
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:21,710
small history of that before.
It seemed like this immediate eruption 

1542
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,140
of all these issues.

1543
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:27,310
Yes,
the country in some ways I wrote about 

1544
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:30,521
in my lates,
but most is France where the book comes 

1545
01:16:30,521 --> 01:16:32,000
out in translation there and a couple of
months time we're very interested to see

1546
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:37,001
what happens because France even,
I mean we mentioned Charlie Hebdo,

1547
01:16:37,311 --> 01:16:40,760
but that 18 months or so it had was 
just,

1548
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:46,390
I mean again,
we'd all sort of disappeared now 

1549
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,850
everyday he's got bad news of some kind,
but you know,

1550
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:51,851
to have a um,
a major western capital city with 130 

1551
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:55,331
people killed in an evening with 
multiple suicide bombings and people 

1552
01:16:55,331 --> 01:16:58,740
being gunned down from mopeds as they're
sitting outside a bar and you know,

1553
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,280
another group of people going into a 
rock concert and you know,

1554
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:08,410
going through the disabled section,
shooting everyone one by one in the 

1555
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:11,891
disabled,
actually catch them in the lavatories 

1556
01:17:11,891 --> 01:17:12,600
and shooting them.
And I mean the,

1557
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,070
that happened in one night alone in 
Paris.

1558
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:19,740
The Parisians didn't become,
you know,

1559
01:17:19,741 --> 01:17:21,940
they didn't become wicked terrible 
people or anything,

1560
01:17:21,941 --> 01:17:24,200
but they have.
I think these,

1561
01:17:24,201 --> 01:17:29,201
I think that the,
a lot of these terrible events that 

1562
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:29,330
happening,
they actually,

1563
01:17:29,331 --> 01:17:33,620
what happens is they sink down to a 
lower level of our consciousness so that

1564
01:17:33,621 --> 01:17:35,770
we,
what actually happens is we,

1565
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,800
we,
we get over the immediate thing quite 

1566
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,241
fast,
but something at the foundational level 

1567
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:47,021
changes.
I had a case nobody really wants to 

1568
01:17:47,021 --> 01:17:50,170
linger on,
but there was one in November in the UK 

1569
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,410
on Oxford Street wear because of course 
everyone does.

1570
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:52,790
After these attacks,
they always say,

1571
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:53,960
you know,
we will not be changed.

1572
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:57,200
Everyone tries to sort of channel the 
spirit of Churchill and all that sort of

1573
01:17:57,201 --> 01:17:58,670
thing.
Um,

1574
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,680
in church you'll hear me roar.
And,

1575
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:04,340
and so and uh,
and actually the,

1576
01:18:04,341 --> 01:18:07,670
the facts are otherwise.
In November on Oxford Street,

1577
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:12,671
there was,
all we know is that there were two men 

1578
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:14,390
who may have had some disagreement on 
the platform of a tube.

1579
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,720
The tube platform,
whatever happened,

1580
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:22,721
it was misunderstood by crowds and it 
developed into a stampede out of the 

1581
01:18:22,721 --> 01:18:25,460
tube station and all the way down Oxford
street people were locked and barricaded

1582
01:18:25,461 --> 01:18:28,170
into the big department stores.
A,

1583
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:30,680
a pop singer called polymers,
uh,

1584
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,320
tweeted out his million followers,
you know,

1585
01:18:33,321 --> 01:18:36,200
there are shots are being fired.
I'm in the back room of the store,

1586
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:38,660
h and m and this sort of thing.
And uh,

1587
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:41,450
other people claim that the truck had 
gone down.

1588
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:43,520
Oxford mowing people down,
they've seen bodies.

1589
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,250
The police said it was a major terrorist
event.

1590
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:49,430
They were on top of it.
And the press were all,

1591
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:54,431
you know,
running stories turned out nothing 

1592
01:18:54,431 --> 01:18:54,431
happened.
Nothing happened.

1593
01:18:54,431 --> 01:18:58,721
The next day,
two men handled themselves into a local 

1594
01:18:58,721 --> 01:19:00,881
police station saying,
I thought they might have been 

1595
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:03,311
responsible for it,
but they will let off without any 

1596
01:19:03,311 --> 01:19:03,311
charge.
What I'm saying is

1597
01:19:03,311 --> 01:19:05,170
they thought they might be responsible 
for it because they had been in an,

1598
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,800
they'd had an argument,
maybe they,

1599
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,610
they weren't saying we're responsible,
healthy,

1600
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:13,080
but like do they ask asking for 
information and they will let go.

1601
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:15,520
But the point is,
is that is that we,

1602
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:18,750
we,
we can simultaneously say we will not be

1603
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:23,640
cowed and also actually be at the stage 
where if you just hear a bang,

1604
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,320
everyone goes running

1605
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:30,780
you,
you don't want to be the last person to 

1606
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:30,780
figure out what's going on.

1607
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:30,780
Hmm.

1608
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,290
So as soon as something you think is 
happening,

1609
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:39,010
people in this day and age when there's 
just this recent history of horrible 

1610
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:41,360
things happening over and over again in 
Orlando here,

1611
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:46,361
I mean there's just so many of them that
people just instantaneously want to 

1612
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:48,110
react and then liking the vegas 
shooting.

1613
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:53,320
One of the things that was very 
confusing about the vegas shooting is 

1614
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,981
people would go into casinos,
they would flee from the concert into 

1615
01:19:56,981 --> 01:20:00,670
casinos and then talk about a shooter,
and then people would say there's an 

1616
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,340
active shooter at the Tropicana.
There's an active choice.

1617
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,210
That's why I never believed that 
immediate aftermath.

1618
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,750
There's a claim of other other shooters.
There's always a claim or something that

1619
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:09,370
turns out not okay.

1620
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:14,420
Everywhere there were,
there were claiming your shooters all 

1621
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:16,641
over the city,
but there was no actual shooting in 

1622
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:18,210
these other casinos who just reports of 
active shooter.

1623
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:20,720
Yeah,
and by the way,

1624
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:25,780
if you're interested,
there's a fascinating thing about why 

1625
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:29,150
this happens and I read a book some 
years ago about bloody Sunday,

1626
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:34,390
terrible event in Northern Ireland in 
1972 and one of the things I went 

1627
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:39,341
through all the tests that we have,
everyone who has seen one of the most 

1628
01:20:39,341 --> 01:20:40,160
interesting things was the number of 
people whose memories,

1629
01:20:40,161 --> 01:20:45,161
which is totally different from what we 
know actually happened and one of the 

1630
01:20:45,161 --> 01:20:47,120
conclusions I came to is that there's a 
book by Harvard professor,

1631
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:50,480
but the called the seven sins of memory 
about this.

1632
01:20:50,481 --> 01:20:55,481
But one of the things that clearly 
happened is after one very traumatic 

1633
01:20:55,481 --> 01:20:59,441
event or have a terrible event where 
people are effectively in the situation 

1634
01:20:59,441 --> 01:20:59,810
of a war zone,
when they were just shopping.

1635
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:05,140
The constantly moment before is that our
memories immediately become even more 

1636
01:21:05,571 --> 01:21:07,100
suggestible than they are already.

1637
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:12,850
And the most obvious thing of 
suggestibility in these situations is 

1638
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:16,810
that the situation was,
was worse around you and you came off 

1639
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:19,760
better than you did.
And that's almost always the case.

1640
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:21,060
Um,
the,

1641
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:22,220
the,
the shots that were quite,

1642
01:21:22,221 --> 01:21:23,060
uh,
quite a bit away,

1643
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,640
we're very close.
Um,

1644
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,300
uh,
you,

1645
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,300
you,
you have your memory without knowing it,

1646
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:35,380
I will do it.
Our memory tells us we behave better 

1647
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:38,560
than we did and the threat was worse 
because this is our,

1648
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:42,090
one of our ways of coping I think.
Um,

1649
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,720
but,
but it's a terrible thing.

1650
01:21:44,721 --> 01:21:49,721
And obviously with,
I mean with these school shootings and 

1651
01:21:49,721 --> 01:21:49,721
things that are going on here at the 
moment.

1652
01:21:49,721 --> 01:21:53,951
I mean,
this is obviously one of the things I 

1653
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:54,210
watched your podcast the other day where
you were discussing it.

1654
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,930
So the latest one with the Florida and 
uh,

1655
01:21:57,710 --> 01:22:02,710
and I think sort of in a way bafflement 
going on in this society about this is 

1656
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:03,320
understandable.

1657
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,430
Yeah.
The,

1658
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:10,740
I mean,
it's the unimaginable horror of being 

1659
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:13,581
involved in that situation.
Your mind is just not prepared to cope 

1660
01:22:13,581 --> 01:22:13,581
with that.
I mean,

1661
01:22:13,581 --> 01:22:17,031
maybe if you're a soldier and if you 
experienced combat and you know how to 

1662
01:22:17,031 --> 01:22:19,050
stay calm and a firefight because you've
been in a bunch of them,

1663
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:24,590
but for the average person,
I mean it's one of the reasons why I 

1664
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:28,041
witness testimonies.
One of the worst pieces of evidence you 

1665
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:28,041
could ever get,
including I mean,

1666
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:32,750
about it,
about basically everything about fist 

1667
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:32,750
fights,
you know?

1668
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:32,750
Oh yeah,
no,

1669
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,170
I.
We all have examples in our lives.

1670
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:36,680
I've seen friends who've been through 
the same thing.

1671
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,720
We know that they burned through the 
same thing and yet they have two totally

1672
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:41,130
different directions.
Of course,

1673
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:43,260
you know what happened.
I mean that's,

1674
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:46,850
that's a real problem,
but now you have this thing here where,

1675
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:52,040
I mean in some ways even worse than we 
do have of the search to notch it up for

1676
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:54,690
your own political science or against 
the enemy.

1677
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:56,970
It's the same thing with a twitter,
the twitter point,

1678
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:58,560
but the.
I mean this,

1679
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:03,540
this obscene glee that goes on after any
terrorist attack in Europe,

1680
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:08,541
but I think also here's what the attempt
is to immediately call it for the other 

1681
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:13,021
side or for your site or whatever and to
to try to use terrible events as a way 

1682
01:23:14,651 --> 01:23:18,760
to justify whatever your team is.
Yes,

1683
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:24,570
I have I find is amazing with the gun 
debate here and I would find it amazing 

1684
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:29,160
coming from a different society on it,
but the wages are not set up for one 

1685
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,750
side or the other in it and it's.
You've got a real

1686
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:37,780
problem on this.
I've been watching a lot of it from the 

1687
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,501
perspective of the gun owners,
NRA members and the people that want to 

1688
01:23:41,651 --> 01:23:46,651
defend the idea of having guns even of 
arming teachers and you're looking at 

1689
01:23:47,711 --> 01:23:52,711
their perspective on it and their 
perspective on it is all about their 

1690
01:23:52,711 --> 01:23:52,780
rights.
All about the constitution,

1691
01:23:52,781 --> 01:23:57,781
all about the bill of rights,
all about protecting the second 

1692
01:23:57,781 --> 01:24:00,661
amendment,
all about gun ownership being taken 

1693
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:00,661
away,
gun ownership,

1694
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:01,810
under attack,
the NRA under attack.

1695
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:05,680
They're coming after our guns and this 
is this constant battle of ideas.

1696
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:08,920
It's on twitter,
not addressing the actual issue.

1697
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,190
Sorry.
No,

1698
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:11,740
it's okay.
It's to.

1699
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:16,190
I'm watching this thing.
Arming teachers.

1700
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,270
Yeah.
That's insane.

1701
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,880
I mean,
this is Samuel Jackson had a great quote

1702
01:24:19,881 --> 01:24:22,000
about it,
but you know,

1703
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:23,750
he uh,
he put it on twitter.

1704
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,770
Like someone tell a motherfucker was 
never been in a gunfight.

1705
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:29,900
The problems of arming a bunch of 
teachers,

1706
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:35,040
right?
Somebody that someone who's been in a 

1707
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:35,040
gunfight,
please tell.

1708
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:35,040
Yeah.
Motherfuckers,

1709
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:35,830
somebody.
Somebody said,

1710
01:24:35,831 --> 01:24:38,880
anyone who thinks is a good idea.
Giving teachers guns as quitting.

1711
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:40,780
Never seen one.
Try to use an overhead projector.

1712
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:42,180
Yeah,
there is.

1713
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,900
There Samuel Jackson.
Look at that 306,000

1714
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,070
likes.
So,

1715
01:24:47,071 --> 01:24:48,840
you know,
it was an effective tweet.

1716
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:53,930
They,
the world we're living in and he just 

1717
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:53,930
checked the number.
It wasn't like,

1718
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:53,930
yeah,
you got three tweets.

1719
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,320
It can't be true.
Nobody likes.

1720
01:24:55,321 --> 01:24:55,500
Yeah,

1721
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:56,260
I,
I,

1722
01:24:56,570 --> 01:25:01,570
I felt that was a very pertinent one a 
few years ago in New York on fifth when 

1723
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:06,370
somebody shot their colleague and I'm 
outside the office,

1724
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:10,210
came back with a disgruntled worker,
the Carnegie and uh,

1725
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,930
locally there were some policemen around
the corner and they came out and started

1726
01:25:13,931 --> 01:25:18,931
firing at the guy who'd done it,
ended up wounding around 11 pedestrian 

1727
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:19,540
like,
well,

1728
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:20,530
you would,
wouldn't you?

1729
01:25:20,531 --> 01:25:21,430
Of course,
I mean,

1730
01:25:21,431 --> 01:25:22,780
I'm not saying by the way,
but we have,

1731
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,840
we have our own problems,
but I mean this is a big problem for 

1732
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,030
America and what I can have more guns 
and we have people.

1733
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:33,940
I mean,
I completely understand why the 

1734
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:37,441
amendment exists and I think it's a very
good idea for the time and I think it's 

1735
01:25:38,561 --> 01:25:40,510
a very understandable.
I did hold onto it now,

1736
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,190
but,
um,

1737
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,800
but why can't people say for instance,
I mean,

1738
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,140
we all have abstract ideas we have to 
hold onto,

1739
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:52,141
but we were all in our countries have 
like weird things that other people 

1740
01:25:52,141 --> 01:25:52,141
don't understand.
I mean,

1741
01:25:52,141 --> 01:25:56,370
you might think it's odd to have a 
hereditary constitutional monarch for 

1742
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:56,370
instance.
And,

1743
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:56,610
uh,
it,

1744
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:58,430
it is weird,
it's a great way to put it.

1745
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:01,540
It didn't seem strange and uh,
if you were starting from now,

1746
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:03,280
you might not do that.
Um,

1747
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:04,670
uh,
but,

1748
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,280
but clearly with the ownership thing,
it is,

1749
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:12,850
we are willing to take bad things 
happening quite often because we want to

1750
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:15,050
hold onto

1751
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,760
the second amendment.
Well,

1752
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,260
the second amendment has been around 
forever.

1753
01:26:18,261 --> 01:26:21,620
The bad things happening quite often is 
really from columbine on.

1754
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,590
I mean,
there was a few of them before the,

1755
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:25,220
there was the Austin,
Texas,

1756
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:26,110
uh,
but,

1757
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,530
uh,
tower shootings.

1758
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:28,670
But it seems like,
I mean,

1759
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,950
again,
I mean just,

1760
01:26:30,951 --> 01:26:33,460
it's such an obvious point.
I don't want to sound like it was high.

1761
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:38,490
It's not a Brit who's saying something 
about America that's not at all 

1762
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:39,500
welcomed,
but it seems obvious that you just,

1763
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:44,980
you could do a lot more damage with a 
semiautomatic rifle than you can with a 

1764
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:47,780
knife.
And most people,

1765
01:26:47,781 --> 01:26:52,781
we see this in the terrorism as well 
where there are really committed 

1766
01:26:52,781 --> 01:26:55,520
terrorists who don't commit acts of 
violence unless they can get hold of,

1767
01:26:55,521 --> 01:26:55,960
uh,
of,

1768
01:26:55,990 --> 01:27:00,990
uh,
the means to do it because we often 

1769
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:00,990
think,
well,

1770
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:00,990
why don't you just like go out with a 
knife?

1771
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:06,460
Some people do,
but most people actually want to go out 

1772
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:07,130
in that way and what they see as being a
blaze of glory.

1773
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:11,510
Right?
So they like stopping them.

1774
01:27:11,511 --> 01:27:13,820
Having the means of getting that very 
easily.

1775
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:17,450
Seems to me very obvious.
But that isn't to say that.

1776
01:27:17,451 --> 01:27:22,451
I mean,
of course I think you made a point the 

1777
01:27:22,451 --> 01:27:23,831
other day and it's like saying if you 
say everyone who has a gun is part of 

1778
01:27:23,831 --> 01:27:27,270
promise and obviously not because it's 
like saying everyone who's got a truck 

1779
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:27,270
is about the problem.
But there is,

1780
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:32,340
there are obviously two things.
One is the psychological and whatever 

1781
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:33,190
the social issues are that caused this 
to keep happening and that,

1782
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,830
that is obviously very,
very important to try to get to the root

1783
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:41,831
of.
But you can get to the root of that or 

1784
01:27:41,831 --> 01:27:45,071
try to get through to that and also 
recognize that people having access to 

1785
01:27:45,071 --> 01:27:49,901
some of the weapons they have access to 
in this country must be a part of the 

1786
01:27:49,901 --> 01:27:50,170
problem problem

1787
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:57,030
it has to be.
And they're also the idea that you 

1788
01:27:58,211 --> 01:28:03,211
should just be able to go out and buy a 
gun without really understanding how a 

1789
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:04,000
gun works at all.
Yeah.

1790
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:08,290
And which is exactly how you do it.
I got my first handgun license in 1994.

1791
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,890
That's when I bought my first hand gun 
and I just went and bought a handgun.

1792
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:13,960
But I did a background check on me.
That's it.

1793
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:16,660
I mean I went to the range.
They showed me what the safety is,

1794
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,670
pointed this,
put the earphones on,

1795
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:20,470
make sure you don't blow yours out,
Bang,

1796
01:28:20,471 --> 01:28:21,100
Bang,
Bang.

1797
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,900
And then you leave the gun.
I mean,

1798
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,420
once your background checks clear,
they find out you're not a criminal.

1799
01:28:25,421 --> 01:28:27,880
There's not much to it.
There's A.

1800
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:32,920
There's a giant problem with that.
If you want to drive an automobile,

1801
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:35,350
you have to show that you understand the
laws.

1802
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:40,620
You have to understand,
you have to sit with an expert was to 

1803
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:41,890
sit there and driving instructor to have
to go through it with you.

1804
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:45,150
They have to watch your movements.
They have to watch you make turns.

1805
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:50,170
They wouldn't,
wouldn't you imagine that it would be a 

1806
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:53,791
good idea to have some sort of a 
clinical evaluation of a person that's 

1807
01:28:53,791 --> 01:28:55,840
gonna going to buy a gun,
and here's another thing.

1808
01:28:55,841 --> 01:29:00,220
There was an article recently that was 
saying contrary to popular belief,

1809
01:29:00,221 --> 01:29:03,810
most school shootings not committed by 
people who are mentally ill will.

1810
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:06,210
That's a fucking stupid thing to say.
You know why?

1811
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:09,120
Because if you're screaming,
you're committing a school shooting,

1812
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,920
you're mentally ill.
Okay,

1813
01:29:10,921 --> 01:29:12,960
period.
Then on top of that,

1814
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:16,410
what they're ignoring conveniently,
and this is another headline thing,

1815
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:22,040
psychiatric medications,
these people are almost entirely on some

1816
01:29:23,131 --> 01:29:28,080
form of psychiatric medication,
whether it is anti anxiety pills,

1817
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:30,780
whether it's antidepressants with there 
they are all.

1818
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:34,410
I'm not saying that correlation equals 
causation.

1819
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,990
I'm not saying that,
but to say that they're not.

1820
01:29:36,991 --> 01:29:39,550
This is just a bullshit,
this is click bait headlines.

1821
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:41,460
They're mentally ill,
100 percent,

1822
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:42,960
100 percent of them are mentally ill

1823
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:47,270
as a conservative commentator in the UK 
called Peter Hitchens,

1824
01:29:47,271 --> 01:29:51,530
who always makes a point after Islamist 
terrorist attacks in Europe that there's

1825
01:29:51,531 --> 01:29:55,820
a large number of them as well as other 
types of attack who seemed to be on some

1826
01:29:55,821 --> 01:29:58,910
kind of medication and my point is 
always I'm very,

1827
01:29:58,911 --> 01:30:03,911
very happy to have that conversation.
I think we need to have that 

1828
01:30:03,911 --> 01:30:05,120
conversation and we also have to have 
the other parts of it as well.

1829
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:06,950
Yes,
so it's the same here.

1830
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:09,950
I can't see why we can't have all of 
this.

1831
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,910
It's the same thing that we were talking
about earlier.

1832
01:30:11,911 --> 01:30:16,911
It's this idea of sports.
These wars people don't want to give up 

1833
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:22,310
their idea.
They don't want to give up any ground 

1834
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,310
whatsoever on their second amendment 
rights.

1835
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:27,560
Whether it's owning a 50 caliber fucking
tank gun or whether it's having a gun 

1836
01:30:28,921 --> 01:30:33,921
for home safety or for hunting.
They don't want to give up anything and 

1837
01:30:33,921 --> 01:30:36,030
they feel like it's a slippery slope.
The people that I follow online that are

1838
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:41,031
tweeting about this on a regular basis 
and you can go to a lot of them like 

1839
01:30:41,031 --> 01:30:45,110
they're making videos about it.
Dana Lash and Collin is actually,

1840
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,900
his name is collins,
Cole Lion,

1841
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:50,870
colion noir and.
Oh,

1842
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,740
I are.
He's very,

1843
01:30:52,741 --> 01:30:53,820
very vocal about it.
I'm,

1844
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:58,821
I'm reading all this stuff.
It's like all anyone's taking into 

1845
01:30:58,821 --> 01:31:01,671
account is that this idea that they're 
coming after your rights and and 

1846
01:31:01,671 --> 01:31:06,230
emphasizing the idea of a good person 
with a gun that can protect people in 

1847
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:09,330
these terrible situations which can 
happen as well,

1848
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,720
but what we have to address it.
That's not what we're talking about.

1849
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:16,320
We have to address how the fuck do these
crazy people get guns?

1850
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:21,920
Why?
Why are so many people on mental health 

1851
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:21,920
medication?

1852
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:21,920
Well,
that's a huge,

1853
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:25,960
a huge fund and we always have one thing
to have the conversation about it,

1854
01:31:25,961 --> 01:31:28,340
but there's very little done on it.
That's one thing.

1855
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:32,020
I'm very struck by this.
We have in all our countries,

1856
01:31:32,021 --> 01:31:35,680
I slipped into a very weird attitude 
towards this type of medical.

1857
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,400
Okay.
Yes.

1858
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:41,520
Very weird.
Very just very accepting of something 

1859
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,080
that radically alters the way your mind 
works

1860
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:48,050
and maybe it's maybe it's not an 
incentive.

1861
01:31:48,051 --> 01:31:51,470
Drug companies obviously don't have an 
incentive quite the opposite and to look

1862
01:31:51,471 --> 01:31:56,471
into it,
but it's another example of the set of 

1863
01:31:56,471 --> 01:31:58,910
set of things we should be thinking 
about at the moment,

1864
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:01,960
looking at which we just don't.
Why don't we,

1865
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:05,530
because it's sort of shut down because 
we shut it down ourselves.

1866
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,210
I,
uh,

1867
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:10,120
I think it's just a such a range of 
issues.

1868
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:12,850
This is the case with and it's always 
the same thing.

1869
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:17,470
It's always that if you address the 
question difficult as it might be,

1870
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:20,770
you are attacking an individual who 
might suffer from it,

1871
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:23,710
who might be upset by US addressing the 
question.

1872
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:29,820
I mean,
I have a lot of suspicions about all 

1873
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:30,290
sorts of things.
I'm a very skeptical person.

1874
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:31,540
Is it worried about things that I'm 
told.

1875
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:33,180
So I'd like to look into things.

1876
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:38,450
I'm amazed at the number of things in,
in our societies that we just don't 

1877
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:40,600
discuss net all the things that we ought
to be discussing.

1878
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:43,960
Um,
issues like mental health issues,

1879
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:49,370
uh,
issues that have to do with a social 

1880
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:51,601
presumptions that are going on left,
right and center at the moment where 

1881
01:32:51,601 --> 01:32:53,380
you're not meant to discuss things that 
have popped into me.

1882
01:32:53,381 --> 01:32:56,320
I was very,
very interesting and very important.

1883
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:59,950
Um,
and I just see it everywhere.

1884
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,840
Um,
this might,

1885
01:33:01,841 --> 01:33:06,841
by the way,
so this is a slightly strange segue to 

1886
01:33:06,841 --> 01:33:08,791
make,
but there was a fascinating one in in 

1887
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:11,320
Britain a couple of days ago,
a slightly lighter subject,

1888
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:13,450
but there was not that much.
But,

1889
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:18,590
um,
there's a dive in the UK called Tom 

1890
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:20,260
Daley who married a screenwriter from 
Hollywood called Dustin Lance black.

1891
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:25,650
And it was announced a couple of weeks 
ago on Valentine's Day that they were 

1892
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:27,820
having a baby and there was a photograph
of them holding a scan.

1893
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:33,030
They sent out on their twitter.
The two men who are married who have 

1894
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:37,440
ultrasound scan and all of the papers 
and the BBC and evidence report is 

1895
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:41,371
saying Dustin and Tom are having a baby.
And I mean,

1896
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:45,160
I'm gay and I'm,
I don't think I'm homophobic,

1897
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,520
but I looked at this as how,
how like someone else involved.

1898
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,900
I mean,
in a joke,

1899
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:54,200
gays,
uh,

1900
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:56,410
you can't have children.
Doesn't mean we can't keep trying,

1901
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:02,340
but I just loaded,
it has nothing in the articles about 

1902
01:34:02,651 --> 01:34:05,080
this tells me anything I would like to 
know,

1903
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:10,910
like I know that they didn't just have a
role around and woke up in the morning 

1904
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:10,910
and one of them was [inaudible].
I know that.

1905
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:15,460
And I know that there has to be a woman 
involved at some point we know this,

1906
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:20,500
but we are meant to just adapt.
Okay,

1907
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:21,280
great.
Cool.

1908
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:25,750
And it's almost as if it's set up so 
that somebody says,

1909
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:27,780
wait a isn't,
isn't,

1910
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:29,920
isn't a woman,
isn't a uterus,

1911
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,520
so that they're no longer is a big word,
right?

1912
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:36,730
Racist,
sexist,

1913
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:38,150
xenophobic.
Yeah.

1914
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:40,360
Everything we've got.
Uh,

1915
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:43,470
and,
and of course somebody did really well.

1916
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:46,090
Somebody from the Daily Mail wrote a 
column saying,

1917
01:34:46,091 --> 01:34:48,610
come on to dads isn't a new normal sort 
of thing.

1918
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,620
And of course then everyone piled in on 
that.

1919
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:53,170
And although he always advertises,
withdrew their advertising.

1920
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:59,270
But this was just on,
this was like literally literally until 

1921
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:02,050
the day before yesterday.
It was possible to say I didn't think 

1922
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:04,220
two guys can just like,
have sex and make a tiled.

1923
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:06,530
Literally that was okay until the day 
before yesterday.

1924
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,700
And it's not okay today.
So what will not be okay tomorrow?

1925
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,830
And I just think,
I think,

1926
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:13,860
and I wrote about it,
uh,

1927
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,830
and uh,
and uh,

1928
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,780
maybe a couple other people ended up 
doing it too.

1929
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:21,730
But I think that's really interesting.
Like a lot of these answers.

1930
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,570
I think it's really interesting about 
this,

1931
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:28,720
that you are the things that seem very 
obvious to us are all the things you're 

1932
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:33,581
not meant to write about.
Almost as if they're like booby traps 

1933
01:35:33,581 --> 01:35:34,790
where you need to go off and,
and I just think,

1934
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:39,500
oh,
why don't more people pile on in because

1935
01:35:39,501 --> 01:35:44,501
we could have a heck of a time and we 
might solve.

1936
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:47,510
Well,
people don't want to pile in on anything

1937
01:35:47,511 --> 01:35:51,920
revolving involving gender or sexuality.
It's just too scary.

1938
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:56,740
It's landmine field.
They can walk in,

1939
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:59,210
especially as you said earlier,
people with regular jobs,

1940
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,600
if you get called out for being a racist
or a homophobe or anything along those 

1941
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:04,750
lines,
you're doomed.

1942
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:05,900
Sure.
It's,

1943
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:07,090
um,
it.

1944
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:12,220
But in that case,
anyone who does have a voice as a 

1945
01:36:12,401 --> 01:36:13,960
writer,
a speaker,

1946
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,250
whatever,
broadcaster,

1947
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:18,580
I think has a disproportionate duty to 
do so.

1948
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,250
To do that.
I mean,

1949
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:25,150
there's no point in just repeating those
same new lies,

1950
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:30,580
uh,
the disproportion of duty to try to 

1951
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:33,151
break them down.
I remember one of my favorite quotes 

1952
01:36:33,151 --> 01:36:33,151
that went from her mencken who says,
you know,

1953
01:36:33,151 --> 01:36:35,080
that history was always progressed by 
jolly fellows,

1954
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:40,110
heaving dead cats into sanctuaries and 
going roy string down the highways of 

1955
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:41,890
the world.
And,

1956
01:36:41,891 --> 01:36:42,700
um,
uh,

1957
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,620
I just,
I,

1958
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:48,630
I,
I wish that there were more dead cat 

1959
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:51,120
lovers because he's such a bad job.
You can make a living sometimes and um,

1960
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:55,800
and it's,
it's,

1961
01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:58,190
it's one of the only things worth doing 
if,

1962
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:01,870
if we're all going to be told lies and 
we expect you to go along with them,

1963
01:37:01,871 --> 01:37:06,871
whether it's about terrorism or,
or gay parenting or mental health or 

1964
01:37:07,381 --> 01:37:08,860
anything else,
whole set of them.

1965
01:37:08,861 --> 01:37:11,320
It's a really target rich environment.

1966
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:16,770
It is,
and I think there's more people doing 

1967
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:19,021
that now than ever before,
but it's more people like you and I who 

1968
01:37:19,021 --> 01:37:20,460
can kind of get away with it.
Yeah,

1969
01:37:20,530 --> 01:37:21,030
I know.
What,

1970
01:37:21,031 --> 01:37:22,410
why do you think you'd get away with it?
By the way?

1971
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:25,060
Me?
Because he can't take me seriously.

1972
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:28,980
I'm a cage fighting commentator and a 
dirty comedian.

1973
01:37:29,330 --> 01:37:34,330
Right?
Nobody's listening to me and take me 

1974
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:35,500
seriously in that regard.
Book sort of.

1975
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,040
It's A.
I just.

1976
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:43,090
First of all,
I'm a kind person.

1977
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,790
I think that helps.
Like I'm not a mean person,

1978
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:51,110
but what I'm saying,
these things I'm saying these things 

1979
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:51,110
from I'm going,
what,

1980
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:51,970
what the fuck is this?
Like,

1981
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:55,380
here's one that I thought was really 
fascinating and this is one of the great

1982
01:37:55,381 --> 01:37:59,730
example of how strange we get on 
subjects.

1983
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,380
Uh,
Caitlyn Jenner,

1984
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,870
when,
when Caitlyn Jenner transitioned,

1985
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:07,710
that was the primary thing that people 
were talking about.

1986
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:10,590
Oh my God,
she's a woman now and it was right after

1987
01:38:10,591 --> 01:38:13,710
she had been spacing out behind the 
wheel,

1988
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:18,810
slammed into a woman and pushed her into
traffic and a head on collision and the 

1989
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:22,431
woman died.
And that was almost just completely 

1990
01:38:22,431 --> 01:38:22,431
forgot.
Completely forgot.

1991
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:25,950
Not only that,
she doesn't believe in gay marriage.

1992
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:26,200
Right?

1993
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:28,990
Like what?
You're,

1994
01:38:28,991 --> 01:38:32,470
you have the wrong spokesperson.
I mean,

1995
01:38:32,471 --> 01:38:35,590
you could not have a more wrong 
spokesperson.

1996
01:38:35,591 --> 01:38:40,591
Yeah.
But yet espn and Glamor woman of the 

1997
01:38:40,591 --> 01:38:44,430
year and all these different things and 
athlete of the year is wearing dresses 

1998
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:48,571
and fabulous and Glam and let's get your
chin shaved down because that's who you 

1999
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:49,510
really are.
We really are.

2000
01:38:49,511 --> 01:38:52,060
Is not this person there.
No.

2001
01:38:52,061 --> 01:38:53,550
You gotTa,
you gotTa Shave your.

2002
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:54,360
It's,
it's,

2003
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:57,050
it's,
it's back to that thing about the.

2004
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:59,060
Almost as if you're being dead.
Yes.

2005
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,820
You're there to discuss it.
Because I said this to Sam Harris,

2006
01:39:01,821 --> 01:39:06,821
I got him into trouble just on his 
podcast by saying this and he didn't 

2007
01:39:06,821 --> 01:39:10,811
attack me.
Apparently he got a whole load of 

2008
01:39:10,811 --> 01:39:10,811
transphobia accusations because of me 
saying something.

2009
01:39:10,811 --> 01:39:13,550
But I said to him,
I thought what was happening was that we

2010
01:39:13,551 --> 01:39:18,551
were being asked not only to agree that 
Caitlin Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn 

2011
01:39:18,551 --> 01:39:19,100
Jenner.
The caitlyn Jenner was a woman,

2012
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:22,740
but that,
but you have to find out.

2013
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:26,450
Yes,
you have to say she's beautiful Shag and

2014
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:27,350
Jenna,
you were just like.

2015
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:28,900
And,
and I find those,

2016
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:31,020
those ones are just,
there was one of the other way.

2017
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:34,030
It's a bit like the gave her anything.
So it's like I dare you,

2018
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:36,530
you just,
you just tried pretending,

2019
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:39,830
pretending that tolman dusting can't 
have a baby.

2020
01:39:40,150 --> 01:39:41,090
Um,
and,

2021
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:42,920
and it was the same with a little while 
ago,

2022
01:39:42,921 --> 01:39:45,830
there was a boy in Britain who was 
iconic,

2023
01:39:45,831 --> 01:39:47,700
whether he wanted to turn up school and 
address.

2024
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:50,510
He's like nine years old.
And there was a route,

2025
01:39:50,511 --> 01:39:52,640
I can't remember.
The school said yes or no,

2026
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:57,950
but it was a big thing.
And then it became like a weigh in on 

2027
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:57,950
the behalf of the nine year old Trans 
Kid.

2028
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:02,591
I got lots of questions to ask that.
And then it became a,

2029
01:40:03,411 --> 01:40:04,720
the,
the nine year old kid was,

2030
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:06,050
was,
was uh,

2031
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:11,120
became a model for a fashion shoot.
And then it's like,

2032
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:14,630
find the nine year old boy who says he's
a girl.

2033
01:40:14,631 --> 01:40:19,631
Attractive and say it's beautiful.
How much more do you want to push 

2034
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:22,590
people?
Like,

2035
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,300
no,
they were awarding.

2036
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:25,100
They like,
like,

2037
01:40:25,710 --> 01:40:27,450
isn't she lovely?
Right?

2038
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:35,320
What are you doing to us?
What are you trying to make us agree to?

2039
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:37,580
Right.

2040
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:38,220
Well,
what's,

2041
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:41,280
what's the cause of all this?
Have you.

2042
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:43,300
I mean,
you must've been talking about this,

2043
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:45,610
like what?
This is this bizarre,

2044
01:40:45,611 --> 01:40:49,120
illogical conversation that falls into 
these very convenient,

2045
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:54,030
well cut grooves that you're really not 
allowed to slide ideas out

2046
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:59,040
of what's causing this.
I think it's a so many things I want is 

2047
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:04,920
one is that it's possible.
This is what happens when the economics 

2048
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,520
goes wrong.
I've got a feeling.

2049
01:41:06,521 --> 01:41:09,630
The economics,
I mean is that if people's,

2050
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,760
if people aren't seeing it increases in 
their living.

2051
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:14,110
I mean,
my generation,

2052
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:16,390
I'm 38,
uh,

2053
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:21,740
by just above this generation,
but the generations ever so slightly 

2054
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:21,740
below me,
um,

2055
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:25,360
is becoming aware that weren't,
get on the property ladder at all.

2056
01:41:25,361 --> 01:41:28,480
Maybe a property ladder,
meaning owning a home,

2057
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:31,450
owning a home,
the things that their parents generation

2058
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:34,090
got not easily by any means,
but it wasn't,

2059
01:41:34,091 --> 01:41:35,920
uh,
it wasn't easy for boomers,

2060
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,390
but,
uh,

2061
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:42,680
that,
that somehow they're going to have it 

2062
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,030
harder than their parents' generation.
Well,

2063
01:41:43,031 --> 01:41:46,120
might not enjoy the living standards of 
the parents' generation.

2064
01:41:46,121 --> 01:41:51,121
Enjoyed,
might be certainly in western Europe 

2065
01:41:51,121 --> 01:41:51,340
coming home.
It might be occurring to them.

2066
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:55,450
What do you do in those such situations?
Um,

2067
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:59,200
you've got to have other things to,
to get worth from.

2068
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:04,950
If for instance,
you're not going to own a home until 

2069
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:05,770
you're 40 and that point,
if you're a woman at your career,

2070
01:42:05,771 --> 01:42:10,771
you need to have children,
but you can't afford to take the time 

2071
01:42:10,771 --> 01:42:11,410
off work and you might not be able to 
start a family and then you're trying to

2072
01:42:11,411 --> 01:42:13,750
start a family in your forties and it's 
harder,

2073
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:18,780
uh,
very hard and a whole set of other 

2074
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:19,670
things like that that are definitely 
delayed for new generation.

2075
01:42:19,671 --> 01:42:24,340
And I think that it's possible.
I'm not saying certainly it's possible.

2076
01:42:24,341 --> 01:42:28,900
It seems to me that that generation 
might discover new gods.

2077
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,760
I might want to enforce the new rules 
just as avidly as the old gods.

2078
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:41,550
And there is an element of that girl.
I can't understand why.

2079
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:47,820
Otherwise,
every time I talk about the things we 

2080
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:50,170
taught her say they would just 
continuously be this very angry.

2081
01:42:50,171 --> 01:42:51,720
We actually not.
It's interesting.

2082
01:42:51,721 --> 01:42:52,490
You know,
I never thought that.

2083
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,340
I think probably like,
you know,

2084
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:59,360
I mean,
it's quite hard to shock me or to upset 

2085
01:42:59,360 --> 01:42:59,360
me.
Uh,

2086
01:42:59,360 --> 01:42:59,360
you know,
and I can.

2087
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,010
Oh,
that's interesting.

2088
01:43:00,011 --> 01:43:01,640
Or why do you think that?
Uh,

2089
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:05,620
so why do I always get this?
Like we've got to stop him?

2090
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:07,950
Uh,
other than that,

2091
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:12,530
these are new commandments were breaking
and,

2092
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:17,650
and why so,
and I mean they're all sort of 

2093
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:17,650
connected,
aren't they?

2094
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:22,200
These things they're all attempts to,
but they're all attempts to something 

2095
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:26,560
like purity,
which disturbs me.

2096
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:32,140
What sort of,
if we could just get everything in a 

2097
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:32,140
row,
you know,

2098
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:32,320
you even hear that thing get in your 
lane.

2099
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:37,910
I hate the people who say that that's 
all in your lane or do you think you are

2100
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:42,220
a,
what's my lane?

2101
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,470
I think I've said it a few times,
you know,

2102
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:45,270
but I mean,
sorry,

2103
01:43:45,310 --> 01:43:47,170
but the only people that needed to stay 
in their lane.

2104
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,420
I'm different.
New York Times.

2105
01:43:49,421 --> 01:43:50,820
Yes.
I was reading on the plane over.

2106
01:43:50,821 --> 01:43:55,821
Okay,
now I'm reading your time on the planet 

2107
01:43:55,821 --> 01:43:55,821
and uh,
and there's a,

2108
01:43:55,821 --> 01:43:55,850
there's a question as a,
uh,

2109
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:57,590
you know,
w we call it,

2110
01:43:57,591 --> 01:43:58,300
what do you go south?
Hell,

2111
01:43:58,310 --> 01:44:03,000
whatever advice column this woman says 
she was on the,

2112
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:08,260
on the train covered days ago and there 
was a man who came in with his 

2113
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:11,711
girlfriend.
He was being really abusive to her and 

2114
01:44:11,711 --> 01:44:11,711
it just kept happening and he was 
really.

2115
01:44:11,711 --> 01:44:13,820
It was kind of nasty ball and violence 
situation.

2116
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:17,070
She doesn't know what to do.
Other people in the case,

2117
01:44:17,071 --> 01:44:19,910
they will move away and of course you 
can see what's coming.

2118
01:44:19,911 --> 01:44:22,740
The combination of it is she says she 
gets off the train.

2119
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:24,410
She wonders whether she should have said
something,

2120
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:29,800
but she says conscious of her white 
privilege and that these people were 

2121
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:33,410
people of color,
and I'm reading this.

2122
01:44:33,411 --> 01:44:38,411
I'm thinking,
what you you now now if you saw a man of

2123
01:44:40,971 --> 01:44:44,960
different skin pigmentation from you 
abusing a woman,

2124
01:44:44,961 --> 01:44:47,030
have different skin pigmentation from 
you.

2125
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:49,430
The right thing is not to defend the 
woman.

2126
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:53,600
That seems like just a real 
justification for being a coward.

2127
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:54,800
Yes,
but,

2128
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:56,530
but,
but I found the advice was yeah,

2129
01:44:56,540 --> 01:45:01,540
now you did the right thing.
Maybe you should've spoken to an 

2130
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:01,540
official suddenly,
but there was no kind of.

2131
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,620
So all this stuff,
all this weird get in your lane.

2132
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:04,690
No,
no,

2133
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:09,700
no.
You're a privileged way of your 

2134
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:09,700
privilege.
I mean,

2135
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:10,310
that's a good way to make society have a
nervous breakdown.

2136
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,440
Is Way up your privilege,
you know,

2137
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,780
privilege scorecards.
I mean my God,

2138
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,420
I am,
but,

2139
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:17,980
but all of these things seem to.

2140
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:20,330
It's almost as if people think if we get
the,

2141
01:45:21,010 --> 01:45:23,150
the,
the lanes correct,

2142
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:29,080
everything will be sorted and here's the
problem is first of all the means of 

2143
01:45:30,861 --> 01:45:32,810
doing this.
It just hideous.

2144
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:36,440
I mean hideous.
They accentuate racial difference.

2145
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:41,470
They accentuates sexual and gender 
differences and accentuate everything 

2146
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:44,561
else and the destination is horrible,
is not the nirvana they think that 

2147
01:45:47,871 --> 01:45:52,280
they're creating.
So this is a really good moment to,

2148
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:57,400
to try to look at some of this and to 
talk about it and to think about as 

2149
01:45:57,561 --> 01:46:02,561
widely and as freely as we can and yet,
and yet the effort is to do the 

2150
01:46:02,571 --> 01:46:07,571
opposite.
I think you're onto something with the 

2151
01:46:07,571 --> 01:46:10,181
idea that this radical progressive,
very restrictive line of communication 

2152
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:15,110
ideology that we're experiencing,
we're talking about is coming from a lot

2153
01:46:15,111 --> 01:46:17,240
of people that don't have a religion.
Yes,

2154
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:20,210
there are atheists or they're at the 
very least agnostics,

2155
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:21,710
modern progressives.

2156
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:23,660
Very rarely religious.
Yes,

2157
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:27,950
and this must be for somebody who's a 
nonbeliever like myself.

2158
01:46:27,951 --> 01:46:30,110
This is a painful thing to look at,
but again,

2159
01:46:30,490 --> 01:46:31,970
you have to think about it,
but that's.

2160
01:46:31,971 --> 01:46:36,971
Isn't that an interesting thing as well 
because you think of yourself as being 

2161
01:46:36,971 --> 01:46:37,900
on a team with these other atheists or 
agnostics,

2162
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:38,660
etc.
I don't,

2163
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,600
but you don't,
but I'm saying as an atheist yourself,

2164
01:46:41,601 --> 01:46:46,601
you have to look at it that way.
You've already lumped yourself In with 

2165
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:46,601
them.
Yes.

2166
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:49,511
I,
I speaking to campus in with us for a 

2167
01:46:49,511 --> 01:46:49,950
while ago and I spoke to a,
a guy who's really,

2168
01:46:49,951 --> 01:46:54,951
really clever,
skewed into as a free thinker and he 

2169
01:46:54,951 --> 01:46:56,170
said,
he said to the officers,

2170
01:46:56,171 --> 01:46:56,880
you were talking.
He said,

2171
01:46:56,881 --> 01:47:01,881
you know,
he'd have some hideous experience at a 

2172
01:47:01,881 --> 01:47:01,881
local free thinkers society,
you know,

2173
01:47:01,881 --> 01:47:02,130
everyone was like,
get in your lane.

2174
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:08,240
And he was like,
I thought that being among free 

2175
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:08,340
thinkers,
like the rest of it will be good.

2176
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:09,080
I was like,
no,

2177
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:09,390
no,
no,

2178
01:47:09,391 --> 01:47:09,900
no.
They,

2179
01:47:09,901 --> 01:47:13,050
uh,
the free thinkers turn out to be just as

2180
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,770
able to be blindfolded if you,
you know,

2181
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:17,050
on certain things down

2182
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:22,900
when you imagine this,
of course self proclaimed free thinkers 

2183
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,860
would be even more inclined to adopt a 
rigid ideology.

2184
01:47:24,861 --> 01:47:27,490
There are proclaiming themselves to be a
free

2185
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:32,540
thinker.
And it's possible that this comes from 

2186
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:32,540
that,
you know,

2187
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:32,540
the,
the,

2188
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:33,690
uh,
the old joke about sentences,

2189
01:47:33,691 --> 01:47:34,020
you know,
the,

2190
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:39,030
the,
the sensor knows everythIng that the 

2191
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:40,790
people who are really into.
And uh,

2192
01:47:40,791 --> 01:47:45,791
I spoke once to man who was on the 
british board of film classification or 

2193
01:47:45,791 --> 01:47:47,130
you said all day watching really 
hardcore pornography,

2194
01:47:47,131 --> 01:47:49,350
deciding what can be legalized.
And the last thing,

2195
01:47:49,990 --> 01:47:51,900
you must have a dark view of humanity.

2196
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:56,940
Well,
that's what justice wasn't justice 

2197
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:56,940
scalia's,
uh,

2198
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:57,940
interpretation of pornography.
I don't know how to describe it,

2199
01:47:57,941 --> 01:48:02,580
but I'll know it when I see it exactly.
Like why are you a fucking judge?

2200
01:48:02,770 --> 01:48:07,770
And it may be,
but it may be that these people that a 

2201
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:11,221
lot of conservatives have this thing,
that one becomes rigid about something 

2202
01:48:11,221 --> 01:48:15,130
because you've seen into the abyss 
because you don't know.

2203
01:48:15,131 --> 01:48:20,131
You might behave in a certain very 
terrible way and so you,

2204
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:24,820
you,
you want to pull back from that chaos.

2205
01:48:24,821 --> 01:48:26,560
You want to pull other people back as 
well.

2206
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:29,200
Seems to me that a lot of circled free 
thinker,

2207
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:34,120
self designated free thing is may well 
have these glimpses and may well think,

2208
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:39,150
I don't know what's holding this 
together and therefore might precisely 

2209
01:48:40,151 --> 01:48:45,151
for that reason be disproportionately 
rigid on almost any new ideology that 

2210
01:48:45,461 --> 01:48:47,770
came along.
Getting lane.

2211
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:50,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

2212
01:48:51,110 --> 01:48:51,690
I like it.

2213
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:55,450
This idea that this is almost like a 
substitution for religion.

2214
01:48:55,451 --> 01:49:00,451
It's almost like there's an inherent 
need that we have because human beings 

2215
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:03,700
have operated under these patterns for 
so long.

2216
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:06,230
We clearly have this need.
It'd be upset.

2217
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:08,750
Did pretend we didn't,
you know?

2218
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:10,460
Yeah.
It's,

2219
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:13,900
it's interesting because the more you,
like,

2220
01:49:14,050 --> 01:49:19,050
we found ways to market and one of the 
ways to market and I think that that's 

2221
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:22,180
important and that mockery,
although it seems trivial,

2222
01:49:22,181 --> 01:49:26,260
what it does do is let people know how 
ridiculous other people feel those ideas

2223
01:49:26,261 --> 01:49:29,710
are and then it makes them reexamined 
themselves because they don't like being

2224
01:49:29,711 --> 01:49:34,210
mocked the term social justice warriors.
Wonderful for that because it just makes

2225
01:49:34,211 --> 01:49:38,770
you look like such a fucking fool.
I'm a social justice warrior.

2226
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:42,180
It was a site that I was a colleague of 
mine,

2227
01:49:42,181 --> 01:49:44,970
a spectator in london called the rod 
little road a few years ago.

2228
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:49,210
Any any man who says he's a feminist?
Clearly just as seeking a shag.

2229
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:49,920
Oh,
for sure.

2230
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,050
For sure.
It's amazing.

2231
01:49:53,190 --> 01:49:58,190
One thing to want quality,
but to proudly state that you're a 

2232
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:59,820
feminist is it's almost.
I have joked around about it like,

2233
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,550
I see what you're doing.
You don't run fast.

2234
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:07,670
You can't pick things up.
That was like the fuck somebody said 

2235
01:50:07,670 --> 01:50:08,210
it's about a,
the end

2236
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:09,410
written.
Uh,

2237
01:50:09,411 --> 01:50:10,250
they said,
uh,

2238
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:15,300
they described themselves as an anti 
racist party and as a comedian who said 

2239
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,450
it actually makes,
makes you think they might be racist.

2240
01:50:18,230 --> 01:50:22,360
It'd be like saying your,
an ntp to affiliate children's agents.

2241
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:27,420
See you think,
who is the community that said that 

2242
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:30,820
doesn't exist.
That's hilarious.

2243
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:32,590
That's so true.
It's so true.

2244
01:50:32,591 --> 01:50:34,930
And so it's virtue signaling to the 
highest degree.

2245
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,030
It's like you're,
you're putting up your flag of,

2246
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:39,940
of moral superiority standing on your 
high ground.

2247
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:40,780
But it is,
it is,

2248
01:50:40,781 --> 01:50:45,781
it,
it obviouslY means a great deal to talk 

2249
01:50:45,781 --> 01:50:45,781
to these people,
but yeah,

2250
01:50:45,781 --> 01:50:48,800
but then the question is just how to,
how to invite them not to think like 

2251
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:48,800
that.

2252
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:52,360
I think mockery mockeries one of the 
best ways because it just lets them know

2253
01:50:52,361 --> 01:50:53,980
that other people think it's 
preposterous,

2254
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:56,290
so it's not achieving the desired 
result.

2255
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,480
The desired result is,
oh,

2256
01:50:58,481 --> 01:51:01,690
look at this amazing person is 
incredible progressive ways of thinking.

2257
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:02,800
Not like,
oh,

2258
01:51:02,801 --> 01:51:05,080
look at this transparent fuck who's just
trying to get laid.

2259
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:08,020
you know,
that's,

2260
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:10,780
that's how a lot of us see it,
but they don't see that.

2261
01:51:10,781 --> 01:51:12,700
We see it that way in some of the,
I mean,

2262
01:51:13,090 --> 01:51:17,140
it's a lot of ways.
A lot of our behavior is a,

2263
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:20,170
it's experimental,
you know,

2264
01:51:20,171 --> 01:51:25,171
I mean,
people are experimenting with various 

2265
01:51:25,171 --> 01:51:26,680
different ways of gaining a social 
preference points.

2266
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:27,780
Well,
this is,

2267
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:31,560
this is why I always say even if even if
people aren't believers,

2268
01:51:31,561 --> 01:51:34,290
there were things that they can learn 
from religion and from tradition.

2269
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:37,430
And I've always thought that the,
um,

2270
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:43,040
I've always thought there's one central 
insight of the judeo christian 

2271
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:46,940
tradition,
which I wish that the social justice 

2272
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:46,940
warriors bore in mind.
And that is,

2273
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:48,910
that's the garden of eden.
And,

2274
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:50,040
and,
and the,

2275
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:55,110
the,
the what we call the crooked timber of 

2276
01:51:55,110 --> 01:51:57,741
humanitY.
Just just to recognize the central 

2277
01:51:57,741 --> 01:51:58,590
truth,
which is in that tradition and in others

2278
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:04,300
that we were not born in this situation 
of research and a,

2279
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:06,340
a perfection,
uh,

2280
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:07,820
or goodness,
uh,

2281
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:09,300
quite,
quite otherwise.

2282
01:52:09,301 --> 01:52:12,480
We are.
We are thIs very,

2283
01:52:12,481 --> 01:52:15,960
very,
a contorted beIng,

2284
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:20,040
a which is,
which is capable of incredible greatness

2285
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:25,490
and beauty and kindness and forgiveness 
and also capable of they're opposites.

2286
01:52:26,341 --> 01:52:28,110
And that's,
and that it's not,

2287
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:31,410
it's not that you are one and other 
people are the other,

2288
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,000
but the,
all of us,

2289
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:33,850
all of us,
uh,

2290
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:35,220
uh,
both,

2291
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:40,280
all the time and so there never is a 
victory and there never is a win other 

2292
01:52:41,581 --> 01:52:46,581
than trying to deal with and restrain 
your own worst impulses in the life that

2293
01:52:49,761 --> 01:52:50,480
you have

2294
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:55,300
and honestly express all the issues that
arrive while you're trying to do,

2295
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:56,980
do that.
Absolutely.

2296
01:52:56,981 --> 01:52:57,370
And,
and,

2297
01:52:57,830 --> 01:53:00,980
and trying to tell the truth where you 
see it and,

2298
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:04,130
and giving voice to it and trying to.
I mean,

2299
01:53:04,131 --> 01:53:05,450
you know,
this is just,

2300
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:08,480
it just seems so clear to me that,
that if people,

2301
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:13,630
if people could realize this is a 
central problem of the thing that you 

2302
01:53:13,630 --> 01:53:16,670
and I and others,
all faith is the desire to claim that,

2303
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:22,100
that somebody who disagrees on issue 
isn't just have a disagreeing mind but 

2304
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:29,270
evil and that in any way we have in 
britain,

2305
01:53:29,271 --> 01:53:34,271
we are ranked at the moment still by 18 
months after a single vote on a single 

2306
01:53:34,271 --> 01:53:39,041
matter of governance.
We are still wracked by really 

2307
01:53:39,041 --> 01:53:39,440
unpleasant polItics from brexit.
Yeah.

2308
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:42,800
And I suspect it's not an,
I hate the overlap of the two,

2309
01:53:42,801 --> 01:53:45,950
but it's probably something like the 
trump events here,

2310
01:53:45,951 --> 01:53:48,530
but again and again,
you come back to the same thing,

2311
01:53:48,531 --> 01:53:53,531
which is just instead of thinking one 
side is entirely right and the other 

2312
01:53:53,531 --> 01:53:57,640
entirely,
it didn't say you give up on objective 

2313
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,441
factor anything else,
but just consider that your opponent 

2314
01:53:59,441 --> 01:54:02,711
might be approaching us with an honest 
motive and might have honest reasons for

2315
01:54:03,081 --> 01:54:04,070
disagreeing with you.

2316
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:08,630
And in the absence of that and with 
media just endlessly feeding us whatever

2317
01:54:08,631 --> 01:54:13,631
it is we know our own side happens to 
think I'm in the absence of that.

2318
01:54:13,701 --> 01:54:18,701
I just see our trenches in both our 
countries just being dug deeper and 

2319
01:54:18,701 --> 01:54:20,480
deeper until,
until there's just no hope of being able

2320
01:54:20,481 --> 01:54:25,481
to even shout over the top and be heard.
And one can get to that stage if,

2321
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:27,650
if,
as I say,

2322
01:54:27,651 --> 01:54:29,570
you recognize that it's,
it's,

2323
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:34,730
it's not a constant fight against nazis.
And you know,

2324
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,230
I mean it,
it,

2325
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:39,830
it's.
By the way,

2326
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:44,831
I'd also never to forget that the nazis 
didn't seem like the nazi's were a lot 

2327
01:54:44,831 --> 01:54:45,680
of people when the nazis were being 
nazis.

2328
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:47,390
Um,
uh,

2329
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:49,970
but it's just,
it's just not as easy as that.

2330
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:52,990
No,
it's not in a,

2331
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:58,350
but it's,
it's an easy way to demonize the other 

2332
01:54:58,350 --> 01:54:58,350
side.
Yeah,

2333
01:54:58,350 --> 01:54:58,650
it's an easy way to prop up your side.
It's a,

2334
01:54:58,651 --> 01:55:01,130
it's a cheap trick.
It is.

2335
01:55:01,550 --> 01:55:06,550
But going back to where we started,
what if the cheap trick ends up having 

2336
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:09,070
some terrible consequence,
um,

2337
01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:13,610
of making all of our defenses go down.
Um,

2338
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:15,410
you know,
if,

2339
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:15,740
uh,
if,

2340
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:18,510
uh,
if I'm not

2341
01:55:19,330 --> 01:55:20,130
well,
the both of you,

2342
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:25,180
I mean,
when we started the conversation off 

2343
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:25,730
with that community guideline strike 
like,

2344
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:27,490
good lord,
this is,

2345
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:31,450
this really is a very,
very strange time.

2346
01:55:32,310 --> 01:55:33,850
Very strange.
Always was.

2347
01:55:34,330 --> 01:55:35,770
Douglas.
Thank you very much.

2348
01:55:35,771 --> 01:55:37,450
I really,
really enjoyed this conversation.

2349
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:42,480
I really appreciate it.
And your book that is out now is death 

2350
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:43,830
of europe.
It's immigration,

2351
01:55:43,831 --> 01:55:44,310
identity

2352
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,010
islam,
and uh,

2353
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:49,230
it's variable.
If you can find any bookshops left,

2354
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:52,290
you got to get it online.
You can get it online as well.

2355
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:53,970
There's a few barnes and nobles out 
there.

2356
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:55,110
All right.
Thank you,

2357
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:56,280
Douglas Murray,
ladies and gentlemen.

2358
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:57,090
Great.
Pleasure.

2359
01:55:57,310 --> 01:55:57,990
Thank you.
My pleasure.
