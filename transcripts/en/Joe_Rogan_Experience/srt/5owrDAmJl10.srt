00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,340
So there's a lot of people
still clinging onto the old,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,020
you know how things you like,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,191
like you said,

5
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,620
people need to watch a show at a
certain time or listen to the radio,

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,880
like drive time.

7
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:12,061
Right.

8
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:12,600
What the fuck?

9
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,730
Who listens to radio on the
fucking drive and the will,

10
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,430
the first thing that switched
it up with Sirius Xm,

11
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,600
cause when serious,

12
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,560
when it was at Sam,

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:19,981
you know,

14
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:24,090
and a opie and Anthony were on and Howard
stern is on what they figured out when

15
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,080
they were doing this or it's like,

16
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:25,680
look,

17
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,930
we don't have to have any censorship.

18
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,520
We could say whatever the fuck we want.

19
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,380
But they started getting in trouble too.

20
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,020
Like opie and Anthony got banned off
the air wants because they brought in a

21
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:37,260
homeless guy and he started talking
about banging Condoleezza Rice.

22
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,140
Oh yeah,

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,190
I did open think they were cool.

24
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,040
I didn't one of them,

25
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,550
but it's not opening Anthony now.

26
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,810
Topian Jimmy Anthony,

27
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,610
he's got his own thing now.

28
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,110
He's got a radio.

29
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,300
But I remember it was funny too,

30
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,100
because I think you're right about that.

31
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,780
Sirius Xm was one a big thing.

32
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:57,630
Cause I remember when hat Owen's
stern who I used to listen to,

33
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,111
who by the way,

34
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:58,440
I listen,

35
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,370
let's do later because Kentucky,

36
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,130
my hometown didn't have started going on,

37
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,980
but I started listening to
them and I loved him and said,

38
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,330
he's going to sell that radio.

39
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:07,500
We can say wherever he wants.

40
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,490
And they're like,

41
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:08,611
well,

42
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:09,630
he's not going to be as funny.

43
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:12,750
Half the fun is listen to him trying to
talk around and then you listen and you

44
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:13,230
go,

45
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,330
that's such a fucking hoe.

46
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,350
It's so much fucking
fun here when he's not.

47
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,660
He's just saying it.

48
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,710
That idea that it's,

49
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:22,380
it's more fun to be censored
when people proof theory's wrong.

50
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,080
You know that's a dump theory though.

51
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,983
That's like,

52
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,070
didn't you hear that all the time?

53
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,150
I heard that all the fucking time.

54
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,013
I never heard that.

55
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,220
I see here that about comedy,

56
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,300
but I was always like whatever.

57
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,760
Sam Kinison and Richard Pryor,

58
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:33,810
my all time favorites.

59
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:35,820
Like how the fuck can you
tell me who's funnier?

60
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:36,421
And Richard Pryor,

61
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,081
I mean it was funny.

62
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:40,350
The Richard Pryor and how can you tell
me that beating around the Bush would be

63
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,690
better than what prior was doing?

64
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,390
You can't,

65
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,880
you can't say you have to be quiet
and maybe it was more in the south,

66
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:45,421
but I kept hearing,

67
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:45,930
you know,

68
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,870
now that he's not got like the
FCC to fight against and he can,

69
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:49,380
you know,

70
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,130
the fun was him trying to get around the
census and he really listened to it and

71
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:53,281
you go,

72
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,930
it's so much fucking
better now that you know,

73
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,390
that's bullshit just to be free.

74
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,650
Completely free to express
yourself without any worry
about a word that's going

75
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,670
to get you fine for hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

76
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,080
And you gotta remember like he got,

77
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,240
he got sued by the FCC,

78
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:06,720
right?

79
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,550
Like healed making the task.

80
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:13,500
He had to go to court over that shit and
they wound up finding him like ungodly

81
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:16,680
amounts of money and there was nobody out
there with him when he was doing that.

82
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,380
Like he's this,

83
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,850
one of the reasons why I'll
never criticize that guy.

84
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,391
He's like,

85
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,980
he's like one of the most important
pioneers when it comes to radio.

86
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,150
Like if it wasn't for that guy and going
out there like that and getting sued

87
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,140
and and having,

88
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,880
that was all during the fucking Bush
administration man when they were those

89
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,570
John and Jack fucking time.

90
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,990
Yeah,

91
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,700
those John Ashcroft fucks man.

92
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,500
That guy was scary though.

93
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:41,850
All these people that were trying,

94
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:42,121
there was,

95
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,200
there was a lot of
religious shit behind it.

96
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,731
That'd be shit.

97
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,030
Their shit in their boots
over this fucking record too.

98
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,460
Well they would be dying over
that record but he got sued.

99
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,931
I mean he,

100
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:53,160
he actually had to spend
real money and real stress.

101
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,760
Imagine the government trying to take
you out all you are as a dirty morning

102
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,650
radio guy and the fucking
government is trying take you out.

103
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
You fucking probably get paranoid as shit.

104
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,380
You should get paranoid.

105
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,730
You fucking should be paranoid.

106
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,780
What does it say here Jamie?

107
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,710
There all the different
fines he had to pay for 1999

108
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,300
he paid them.

109
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,460
Yeah,

110
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,293
some of them got paid.

111
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,770
This isn't probably the initial
finds that they started as either,

112
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,110
but I think this is what
they got whittled down to,

113
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,480
or let's read them off.

114
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:22,870
That'll 1990 he got fined
$6,000 from the FCC.

115
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,620
1992 we got fined $105,000 from the FCC.

116
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,390
1992 again,

117
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:28,961
he got fined.

118
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,961
600,000 1993 got five find
500,000 1993 got fined.

119
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:40,351
Seventy three thousand thirty
seven thousand four hundred
thousand in 94 200,094

120
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,453
holy fuck.

121
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,160
And then it just keeps going on and on.

122
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:44,340
And on.

123
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,173
The last one right there,

124
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,270
495,000 in 2004 2000 and fucking
four and that fucking insane.

125
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,840
That's during the Bush administration.

126
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,970
After nine 11 he got fined $1 million.

127
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:58,750
$95,000 half a million dollars
in fines for saying bad words.

128
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,190
Wasn't even saying bad words.

129
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,020
He didn't even say bad words.

130
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:02,860
He didn't swear.

131
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,940
That's what was crazy.

132
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,220
Just top it subject matter.

133
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,490
The d like talking about farts or
Piss or shit or something like that.

134
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,260
It was so crazy though.

135
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:12,550
Such a crazy time.

136
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,230
If I were to say that to
someone who didn't know,

137
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:14,650
they would think,

138
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,760
oh you mean that the 50s or the 40 this
is fucking 2000 thousand four and if he

139
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,840
didn't go through that,

140
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,050
if there wasn't this backlash from
the public finding out about it,

141
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,600
cause everybody I know that
heard about it was like what?

142
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,840
How would they wasting our fucking money
suing him over a radio show that by the

143
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:34,810
way has 20 million people
listening to it every morning.

144
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,830
It's pretty obvious that
people were enjoying this
radio show and when they stop

145
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:40,300
enjoying it it'll go off the air.

146
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,100
That's what the fucking
free market is about.

147
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,300
But it wasn't about that.

148
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:47,110
What it was about is controlling somewhat
cause it wasn't just his dirty shit.

149
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,120
That's not what concerned
them as much as his,

150
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,370
his criticism of the Bush administration,

151
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,360
his criticism,

152
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,260
political political policies and his
willingness to say whatever the fuck he

153
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:56,561
wants.

154
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:57,670
He's a dangerous guy.

155
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,870
He said too much power.

156
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,733
You think him?

157
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,190
You think that's what
Kinda started podcasts.

158
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:03,024
Do you think that?

159
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:03,461
No,

160
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,050
I don't think that's
what started podcasts.

161
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,500
Um,

162
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,990
but I think that for him that started the,

163
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:08,440
the,

164
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,390
the journey eventually to Xm,

165
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,380
like he had to,

166
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,000
to serious whatever it was at the time.

167
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,560
He had to like,

168
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,840
they were fucking with him
constantly all the time.

169
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,910
I don't think he gets
enough credit for that.

170
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,110
It's insanity man.

171
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:20,771
Yeah.

172
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:21,120
Well he's,

173
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,500
I,

174
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,150
he loses,

175
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,740
he said he's a hero of mine that in 2040
got fine for those that cock for spink

176
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:30,040
during a product for maintaining
anal and genital hygiene.

177
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,350
Thompson was going after him.

178
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:34,690
He was doing those things after
video games and stuff too.

179
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:36,100
If you're from the Tennessee guy,

180
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,200
he got Davis and attorney
Jack Thompson supplied.

181
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:42,160
The FCC was show transcripts.

182
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,510
Oh God.

183
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,580
And listen,

184
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,360
I don't need,

185
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,020
that's not what I,

186
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,010
I pay my fucking,

187
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,761
well nobody did,

188
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,594
but it wasn't official.

189
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,890
I guarantee you a lot of it was about
controlling a powerful guy cause he had

190
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:55,660
talked about running for governor member,

191
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,460
remember?

192
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,293
Yeah.

193
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,050
But he would have got to have to disclose
how much money he made and that's when

194
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:01,100
he decided not to do it.

195
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,650
I wonder if you would do that now
because now everybody knows he's got a

196
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,700
hundreds of millions of dollars.

197
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,880
I wonder if it even the people run now.

198
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,480
They haven't disclosed shit.

199
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,020
Well,

200
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,920
Trump has.

201
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,140
Trump says he's worth
more than he actually is.

202
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,190
That's what's hilarious about him.

203
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,121
I know,

204
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:14,950
but I'm saying has he,

205
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,280
have we seen the actual like,

206
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:16,551
well,

207
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,520
Bernie Sanders just released
his tax returns in his tax turn.

208
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:23,180
Said that he made less money last year
than Hillary Clinton did for one single

209
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,014
speech.

210
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:24,650
Holy.

211
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,650
He made $200,000 and she's made as much
as I think to 90 for once be maybe even

212
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,640
in the threes for one speech.

213
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,640
I want to ask you to negotiate.

214
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,880
I'll,

215
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,460
I'll release my own fucking return.

216
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,570
They're like of money.

217
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,170
I lost.

218
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,060
How many seats is this?

219
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,150
Is about 400 seats.

220
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,900
Okay.

221
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,830
I want end up like,

222
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:40,910
you know,

223
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,780
quarter million bucks.

224
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,580
What did I just told you?

225
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,050
There's like 400 seats.

226
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,381
Like,

227
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:49,640
how much are we charging these people
and we're going to pay you that to 25.

228
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,340
I think memory,

229
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,860
I'll take that pearl jam,

230
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,060
fighting over ticket prices,

231
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,630
making sure they don't get to be 25
bucks and now when people are paying

232
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,010
250,000,

233
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,450
I know.

234
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,283
Watch a speech.

235
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,163
Well that is uh,

236
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,210
obviously just bribery money.

237
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,600
It's just bizarre that she won't release
the transcripts of the bribery money

238
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,160
teachers.

239
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,310
Anytime you don't want
to release something,

240
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,160
it's always good.

241
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,400
Imagine what she said.

242
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,593
You know,

243
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,570
it probably sacrificing babies
and shit and lighten owls on fire.

244
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,200
We probably had an effigy and the
war was probably all over them papers

245
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,711
probably.

246
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:21,200
He was probably one of the reasons
why she kept her mouth shut.

247
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:22,911
If it keeps,

248
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,350
it keeps his album's coming out,

249
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:24,890
I'm all for it.

250
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,131
Yeah.

251
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:25,970
Whatever he's gotta do,

252
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:26,150
man.

253
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,470
There's a lot of people
that need to be shot,

254
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,430
right?

255
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,650
Well,

256
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,390
yeah,

257
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,580
no,

258
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:29,781
no.

259
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:31,830
He's not taking out the
good guy he's taking,

260
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,380
he's taking out enemies of the state.

261
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,280
That's what's up,

262
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:34,491
dude.

263
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:35,810
He's like a showtime,

264
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,680
um,

265
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,940
drama series,

266
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,970
assassin type guy.

267
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,980
Maybe it'll make that show.

268
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,180
Imagine if that was the show.

269
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,590
Sturgill Simpson just run around there.

270
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,071
It was like,

271
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:46,670
do you remember that movie where
the guy from the gong show chuck.

272
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:46,940
Oh,

273
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,500
come check the writings
of a dangerous mind.

274
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,240
Yeah,

275
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,731
that was cool.

276
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,564
It was kind of crazy.

277
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,200
I was half out of it and watching that
movie in a hotel room in Vegas and I know

278
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,320
I remember like falling
asleep from memory.

279
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:57,800
It was a cry,

280
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,560
but he wasn't really worried.

281
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,100
He thought he was worried
for the gun that was,

282
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,960
but it was really weird.

283
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:03,291
It was like,

284
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,410
what is this like?

285
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,880
I remember reading it like
reading a passage from it too,

286
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,360
like it's a book and I remember
reading the passage going,

287
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,000
what is this?

288
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,721
Is this fake?

289
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:12,471
Was he on drugs?

290
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,304
Like what is this?

291
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,280
I never got into it.

292
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,100
We were talking you speaking of that Shit,

293
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,260
talking about,

294
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,960
you know,

295
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,980
First Amendment,

296
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,281
you know,

297
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,360
freedom fighters,

298
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:20,770
one of the,

299
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,800
he a major hero and people don't
know about it from Kentucky Zone.

300
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:25,820
Mr Larry Flynt,

301
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,710
he did a lot of fun.

302
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,280
I don't think people
realize how I'm putting it.

303
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:30,170
There was that movie made out,

304
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,820
but I don't think,

305
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,060
and he's um,

306
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,020
and people you get laughed
at when you say Larry Flint,

307
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,280
Flint is a hero of yours.

308
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:37,610
Cause he's like,

309
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:37,810
oh,

310
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,750
cause you love hustler.

311
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,711
And you know,

312
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:40,251
I love Nikki,

313
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:41,280
but it's not what I'm talking about.

314
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:41,440
No,

315
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,350
no freedom speech.

316
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,010
Matt,

317
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,010
he did more for freedom of speech than
probably anyone alive right now that you

318
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:54,170
had to be as fucking crazy as he took
that shit to the supreme court because he

319
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:56,400
was fucking insane and he's rich as fuck.

320
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,180
And he didn't get,

321
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,570
yeah,

322
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,650
the was the perfect amount.

323
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,080
It was a perfect timing to these.

324
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,760
This is before porn hit the internet
and the money kind of eroded.

325
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,210
Yeah.

326
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,450
You know,

327
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,790
back then he was selling those magazines.

328
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,440
He was rich from selling magazine.

329
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,100
He was going to lose everything
because of a fucking Joe when I was,

330
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,490
yeah,

331
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,323
he really was.

332
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,610
When I first came to la,

333
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:15,690
I remember seeing that building,

334
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,790
that flip publications building.

335
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,893
Oh yeah.

336
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,760
The norm is fucking huge.

337
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:21,710
I knew some of the,

338
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,100
the his,

339
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,750
I don't know.

340
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,300
I've,

341
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,200
I've met him briefly.

342
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:25,870
I know some of the hit,

343
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,430
you know,

344
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,650
family members back in Kentucky.

345
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,484
But yeah they got,

346
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,863
they um,

347
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,510
it's an empire but also I think
when he dies it'll come up.

348
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,550
It'll be talking about it,

349
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:35,701
you know,

350
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,570
they'll be,

351
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,281
they'll be the joke,

352
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:38,520
he national news shit,

353
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:43,521
but there'll be some really interesting
fucking pieces written about what he

354
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:47,340
actually did cause he
really changed everything.

355
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,210
And like this album,

356
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,340
literally I couldn't make
this album without lyrics.

357
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,850
I agree.

358
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,970
And I think that what was going on with
him at the same time as what was going

359
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,170
on with a Howard Stern,

360
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:56,160
there were all real similar.

361
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,540
I was real similar and the government was
trying to decide what people could and

362
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,280
couldn't do and the people that didn't
get defended where the dirty ones tell

363
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,260
dirty magazine guy,

364
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:05,400
the dirty radio guy,

365
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,960
for whatever reason we didn't,

366
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,680
they didn't get defended.

367
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,513
Where a journalist,

368
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,280
if a journalist is getting attacked
like that for revealing the truth about

369
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:11,581
something,

370
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,420
people would be up in arms,

371
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,950
the intellectuals be up in arms.

372
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,600
But nobody recognized that.

373
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:19,380
It's just as dangerous to tell people
that they can't jerk off to hustler as it

374
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:24,381
is to tell like a political dissident
that that's they said at the trial.

375
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,860
I mean the Ed Norton Guy Played Him.

376
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,693
He's like,

377
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,540
this has nothing to do with whether
you like hustler and has to,

378
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,390
it's no different than any
free speech trial anywhere.

379
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,381
But by the way,

380
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:35,214
if you,

381
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:35,640
you know,

382
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:35,881
if you,

383
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,140
if you rule against this,

384
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,980
that it could lead to people
being censored in all,

385
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:41,940
in all different forms.

386
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:42,870
But this is,

387
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,890
it took something that fall that crazy
to get it to the supreme court and

388
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,210
someone that fucking crazy.

389
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,460
It's just too problematic when you,

390
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:53,010
when you tell people what
they can and can't talk about,

391
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:54,270
it's too problematic.

392
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:54,811
You know,

393
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:55,081
if you,

394
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:57,510
if you censor someone for a specialty,

395
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:58,710
like sexual stuff,

396
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,140
like you sensor someone for putting out
a magazine where people have sex and it,

397
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:02,270
you know,

398
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,050
obviously people have liked that forever.

399
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,830
You do know what the,

400
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,850
what the actual trial was.

401
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,170
Uh,

402
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,520
I'll,

403
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,250
I'll repeat it if it
was an obscenity trial.

404
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,550
Right.

405
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,090
But he,

406
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,690
he did it.

407
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,201
He actually,

408
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:15,201
they had comic pieces in the magazine and
he did a piece where he said that this

409
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:15,721
one,

410
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:16,421
I may need help,

411
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:17,254
but Jerry,

412
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,451
Jerry Falwell,

413
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:19,080
I think men,

414
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,800
but men find it online.

415
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,340
But you said that before
I find out it was,

416
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,040
I want to get the guy's name right
before I fucking Jerry Falwell,

417
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,833
Larry Flint.

418
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,980
Um,

419
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,180
he was the big guy at the time,

420
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:30,870
right.

421
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,310
Jerry Falwell's guy that got caught
with a hooker to wasn't it or has Jimmy

422
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,230
Swaggart I get them all mixed up.

423
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,340
Jimmy Swaggart cried on TV.

424
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:40,174
It was awesome.

425
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,033
You don't remember that?

426
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:41,521
Oh yeah,

427
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,001
I saw that.

428
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,120
Yeah,

429
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,271
man.

430
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:42,751
I used to,

431
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,080
I used to watch that shit all the time.

432
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:45,010
It was amazing.

433
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,960
It was amazing because we all
knew that he was a crazy fuck.

434
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:49,870
We need,

435
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,760
it's not cherry fall.

436
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,170
It's a Larry Flynt and,

437
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,004
uh,

438
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,300
just Google Larry Flynt Supreme Court.

439
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,571
Anyway,

440
00:11:55,571 --> 00:12:00,571
the point was this preacher had
sex with his mom and an outhouse.

441
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,120
Outhouse.

442
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,490
Yeah.

443
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,270
In the magazine.

444
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:04,991
And I've made like,

445
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,950
we had a cartoon of it,

446
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,400
right.

447
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,280
And I went and saw Larry
Flynt speak cause I said,

448
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,741
like I said,

449
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:12,100
I'm a big fan of his and so they,

450
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,660
the guy sued them.

451
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,460
Well it's Jerry Falwell.

452
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:15,641
Okay.

453
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,450
That's what I thought.

454
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,540
So he said Jerry Falwell had sex with
his mom and an outhouse and it was a

455
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:19,870
cartoon,

456
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,300
like a mad magazine for part two.

457
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,000
And your follow suit them for liable,

458
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:25,231
you know,

459
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:25,540
not,

460
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:25,960
he's like,

461
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
it's obviously a fucking joke.

462
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,330
Like I'm,

463
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,260
I don't think you know,

464
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,460
this is fucking comedy.

465
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,370
And he sued them and it went
to the fucking supreme court.

466
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:37,780
And I went and saw the Larry
Flynt talk and when they repeat,

467
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,680
when the lawyer,

468
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,920
this is Larry Flynt said this is what,

469
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:40,421
when he knew,

470
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:42,700
he knew he was going to win
the supreme court trial.

471
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,330
When his lawyer repeated what
the article said that his,

472
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,280
his mom had sex at.

473
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,330
Jerry Falwell had sex,

474
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,050
his Momma House,

475
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,920
he saw the supreme,

476
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:58,210
he saw the judges giggle for a second
and the lawyer stopped and he's like,

477
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,130
and that's when he knew he had the
trial one because the whole point is,

478
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,540
you laughed when I said it,

479
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,300
that this guy fucking his
mom out in and out house.

480
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,750
Obviously it's how are we going to have
an argument that's not comedy when all

481
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,700
all you fuckers just started laughing.

482
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,860
He said from that point on
he knew he was going to win.

483
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,300
And it was funny too,

484
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:20,320
he also said that Jerry Falwell came to
him years later and they became friends

485
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,230
and he wanted to go do a
speak cause I guess he had,

486
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:23,981
you know,

487
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:24,900
maybe not watch his money.

488
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,120
He wanted to go do a speaking
tour with Larry Flynt.

489
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,733
And uh,

490
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,411
it's like,

491
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,340
what thought I just,

492
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,591
you know,

493
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:35,860
I want the biggest supreme court
freedom of speech he's ever again,

494
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,670
he said he realized
that's when they kind of,

495
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,760
he's like Jerry Falwell too.

496
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:40,451
It's all a show.

497
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:41,170
You know,

498
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,003
it's all,

499
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,180
it was just a,

500
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,680
it was just theater to him.

501
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,171
Like,

502
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:45,620
we,

503
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,360
we can go out and make some money on
the road and we talk about each other.

504
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,920
Exactly.

505
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,870
The friends like fuck you.

506
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,141
That was,

507
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:50,410
I was,

508
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,243
I was,

509
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,420
I was serious about it.

510
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,630
And um,

511
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,600
we had a funny though,

512
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,950
it was like the party with Jerry
Falwell find out what it goes down,

513
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,020
but when he got drunk
he did become friends.

514
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:00,460
And another one I'd have to look,

515
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:00,850
I,

516
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,560
I'm almost positive that when he died,

517
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,590
Larry Flynt wrote his
maybe for the La Times.

518
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,450
I think Larry Flynt wrote his obituary.

519
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,300
Really?

520
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,133
You know.

521
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,820
Wow.

522
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,211
But yeah,

523
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,470
they became friendly or later,

524
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:11,871
but it was,

525
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:13,060
it's an interesting trial.

526
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,320
You should definitely check out.

527
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,700
Um,

528
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,020
and the movie is sums it up,

529
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:20,230
but you got to get into the details of
it because what they used to do at hustle

530
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:21,820
was pretty fucking crazy.

531
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,510
I mean,

532
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,021
besides,

533
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:23,650
you know,

534
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,420
really getting in there,

535
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,190
looking inside the post and all that shit.

536
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,890
They're like,

537
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,030
they had been in shit,

538
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,330
like they would do crazy like kind of x
rated mad magazine and that was a chip.

539
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:34,631
Ironically,

540
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:35,870
they've got him in trouble like,

541
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:36,704
you know,

542
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,940
as you know that the,

543
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,230
it was what it was the the second year
that they were actually pissed about.

544
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,011
But yeah,

545
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:45,340
but that was what they could catch him
on because there were so preposterous.

546
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,170
Some of them are so graphic.

547
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,101
That was,

548
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:48,371
I guess.

549
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:48,540
Yeah,

550
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,320
that must've been the
one that was the guy who,

551
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:50,960
uh,

552
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,900
this is the letter he wrote
in the La Times after he died.

553
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,550
How I find myself,

554
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,090
it is,

555
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,460
he is a phrase that's his,

556
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,110
that's Larry Flynt Obituary for the
article is called the porn king and the

557
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:03,944
preacher.

558
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,100
Interesting.

559
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,910
Is there the 1997 autobiography or
biography called an unseemly man.

560
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,120
Yeah,

561
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,953
he's hilarious.

562
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,350
Let's look.

563
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,940
He sued him for $50 million.

564
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,500
That's why I went to the Supreme Court.

565
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,850
He kept losing the case.

566
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,760
I lost repeatedly yet
eventually won a supreme court.

567
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,330
Wow.

568
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,163
I kept losing it.

569
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,050
Now he's hugging me in front of
millions on the Larry King show.

570
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,943
Whoa.

571
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,720
That's the same one.

572
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,830
How much it cost him to fight those
off because someone suing you for $50

573
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:33,831
million.

574
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:34,940
If he lost her repeatedly,

575
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,470
each one of those things that's it had,

576
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,800
luckily it was the right
guy who was crazy enough,

577
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:40,281
like you said,

578
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:43,700
and had the money to fight it because
most people would have just never wouldn't

579
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:44,780
have thought at once much less.

580
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:46,280
All the way up to the supreme court.

581
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,233
Yeah.

582
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:47,991
It's funny,

583
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:48,824
man.

584
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,730
It's funny.

585
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,630
The whole thing is funny.

586
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:51,951
Yeah.

587
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,970
I mean the real story.

588
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:55,520
It's one of those things where the real
stories crazier in the fucking mood.

589
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,131
Well it's,

590
00:15:56,131 --> 00:16:00,300
it's crazy that it's such a pivotal
moment in free speech history yet.

591
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,143
Like you said,

592
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,320
it's not something anybody ever talks
about that he actually had to go out

593
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:04,451
there.

594
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:04,920
Like,

595
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,810
I mean they were saying before there's
an SNL might not exist if that was,

596
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,580
if he had won that case.

597
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:11,850
Well,

598
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,091
look,

599
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:13,620
if he can a daily show
or any of that shit.

600
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:14,310
If you can't,

601
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,060
if you can't parody public figures,

602
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,020
SNL can happen,

603
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,440
right?

604
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,460
You can't do the daily show,

605
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:20,850
you know?

606
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,930
And we could prove that.

607
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,060
And here's the way to prove it.

608
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:24,290
It's sort of a round about way,

609
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,440
but marijuana is still illegal in 2016
because of some bullshit propaganda that

610
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:34,610
was made in the 1930s so
that momentum carries on,

611
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,050
even though it doesn't make any sense.

612
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,060
You could still go to jail
today for growing pot.

613
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,390
So if you think that if Howard
stern didn't have those lawsuits,

614
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:42,350
didn't pay all that money,

615
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:45,350
didn't make this big public
outright did public outcry,

616
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,870
didn't have to go to
Sirius satellite radio.

617
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,050
If all those things didn't
happen and they won,

618
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,010
what if they shut him down?

619
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,520
What if they pulled him off the air with
Larry Larry Flynt loss and never fought

620
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,470
it would have everything buckled down.

621
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,140
How long would it take for
the Internet to happen?

622
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,771
How would it,

623
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,030
what would have taken forward?

624
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,070
Things like reddit or four Chan or these
fucking uncensored blogs or uncensored

625
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,960
youtube content where you
can do whatever you want.

626
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,711
Vimeo,

627
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:11,060
all that shit podcast,

628
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:16,130
that ripple from those two guys is like
one of the most important ripples for

629
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:19,310
free speech media in 2016 and
it's one of most important,

630
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,560
like pivotal moments in
the history of free speech,

631
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,970
and we're talking about that.

632
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,841
It's amazing,

633
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:24,260
right?

634
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,430
It's fucking crazy and crazy that we're
talking about an x ray had record that I

635
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:29,990
own on a podcast that you own.

636
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,500
Yeah.

637
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,380
This wouldn't have been
fucking like this whole world.

638
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,490
The whole thing wouldn't have happened.

639
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:44,530
Okay.
