1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,550
Great. Great. Hmm. That's probably, it
is great. We can you, yeah, great. Great.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,350
Nailed it. That's where I
got it. Ron White. We live.

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,540
Oh we are. Oh, sorry. We're what a
fancy beginning. That's how I do it.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,990
I like it to be professional. Cheers my
brother. Cheers. Cheers. Good to be here.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,033
Good to be here.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,190
Delicious. Good to see you
after that. Mentally intensive.

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,210
Uh,
carbohydrates versus fat.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm done. Genuinely came out of
there looking at ex exhausted.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,900
It was a rough debate.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,390
They were going back and forth.
They didn't like each other.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,390
They were mocking each other a little bit,

12
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:47,010
but hopefully people got some
information out of it. Two good guys.

13
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:51,630
They just a different positions.
They don't see eye to eye Joe. Nope.

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,760
What are you gonna do? What are you
going to hear them out? Exactly?

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,130
What am I going to do? Ron
White. So, uh, apparently Ron,

16
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,700
why you have a mugshot that
we can add to our collection?

17
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,920
You have one over here. I'll
have it framed and descending
on up. Oh, I'll meet.

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,860
We'll make sure it's a small enough to
put on that wall out there, you know,

19
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:14,180
so it'd be a pretty big one. I'd like to
have a pretty dominant spot over at the,

20
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:16,190
uh,
tell me what you need experience.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,390
I'll give you a fucking six foot tall one
brother. Alright. Alright. That's all.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,120
That's it.
Six foot tall size.

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,990
Yeah. Get it free. Fuck it.
Yeah, it was a bad picture.

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,430
They were really bad. So this, we're,
we're talking about this, this is a,

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,320
you got busted for weed.

26
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,920
Somebody ratted you out that
there was weed on your plane.

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,510
No, that they didn't say there
was a weed on that plane.

28
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,980
They said it was a drug smuggling plane.
And uh,

29
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,760
so there's a hotline that you can call
and they just pilots that I'd fired.

30
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:47,760
And uh,

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,520
and so I'm just sitting on the plane
looking out the window and there's drug

32
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:57,260
dogs and people invest and machine guns.
And I'm like, what's going on out there?

33
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,580
Well, but you know, as soon as they
determined that that's not what it was,

34
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,030
that I just had some personal weeds that
obviously somebody called in and allied

35
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,160
instead of going in and
arrested and that guy,

36
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:10,340
they took me to jail then it makes
no sense at all. And then the,

37
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:13,400
in the newspaper, the sheriff goes, well
he might not have had much pot with him,

38
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,790
but who knows how much he did have.
And who knows, I didn't kill somebody.

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,860
How about we just put me up for murder
right now if we need no evidence at all.

40
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:24,170
You know, is he didn't steal
larceny. How about that?

41
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,000
It's something they went
and they drove by in a pit.

42
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,680
They drove by three meth labs in a
dead hooker just to get to my plane.

43
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:34,911
And the really,

44
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:39,150
the funny part of it was the next day we
were going to go somewhere else and I'm

45
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,660
in Louisiana and uh, but then now
I've got a, you know, just we,

46
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:45,620
we can get rid of, that's
all we can do. Cause they,

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
they might do it again next
night, next place, more dry.

48
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:53,450
So now we've got an apple
were smoking out of there.

49
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,020
They have to have them on horseback and
Alex feeds that one of the horses as

50
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,260
he's walking back, you can take
this little apple. They tried,

51
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,410
you'd check your plan again.
They did check it again. But we,

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,350
we just had come up with this
little plan that uh, you know,

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,440
we would just would end,

54
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,710
he also had to eat a little bag of
weed and he was really stoned on stage.

55
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,690
That's really strong. But we, you know, we
didn't go to jail that night. If you eat,

56
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:20,810
just eat, just eat weed will get you
high. Yeah, absolutely. Will it take,

57
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,410
it takes a while, but it was a big old
chow of it. I mean, it will be old.

58
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,080
The lip full cheek full. I'm surprised
people don't chew. We'd like,

59
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,690
there's no one out there chewing.
It tastes like ass dude,

60
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,800
which is why nobody eats. We'd
even the cookies, you know,

61
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,140
they gotta they gotta watch
it to keeping patients.

62
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,170
There is a growing number of people
who juice the leaves and drink it.

63
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,540
Yeah. You know, like wheat grass juice.

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,910
They do it with the
leaves of cannabis plant.

65
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,200
I've seen people squeeze it to make
the Gig like the concentrate out,

66
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,080
but did not think they're a, they're
sticking in one of those master caters.

67
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,630
Is that what they called?
Those things that make a,

68
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,130
you know like wheat grass like he had,

69
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,990
they can get juice out of fucking grass.
It makes sense.

70
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:09,760
If you could get it out of, I mean
of you could get it out of the plant.

71
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,310
Right? It doesn't, you don't
get, you don't get high though.

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,200
It's like getting a CBD out there.
What's the point for Health Ron?

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,260
Oh yeah. You know, it's
like, oh duals pot.

74
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,710
Oh to tell you what's not bad. You've
heard the Heineken Shit that we got.

75
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,460
We have Heineken zero, zero, whatever
the fuck it is. It does not taste bad.

76
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,410
It's okay. Go to no alcohol in it, but it,

77
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,340
but it tastes so you don't get
that annoying buzz. I know.

78
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,570
No you don't get none of that.
Cause you guys had that soccer,

79
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,080
a sober October and it looked like you
were having a blast. I have to admit,

80
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:46,380
sitting from the sideline, they call it,
boy, this sober thing looks like a blast.

81
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,620
I did have a November to remember.

82
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,840
Yeah, we had no remember November. Um,
yeah, sober October is interesting.

83
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,930
It's good to do every year. I like
to do it. You think you'd ever do it?

84
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,200
I don't think I could not. How many
days do you think you'd take it off?

85
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,240
Uh, you know, really not one.
It'd be very happy about it.

86
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,670
Everything that I've got a little touch
of a alcoholism that someday I'll either

87
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:16,080
deal with or I won't. But, you know, it's,
it's a maintenance thing with me. So,

88
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,890
uh, maintenance as far as
keeping your mindset correct?

89
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,720
Just feeling good.
Like what is it?

90
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,060
Yeah. You know, it's just a
give a fuck juice. I don't know,

91
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,020
it's just something that I seem
to require, you know, it's,

92
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,200
I can't wait for that first drink
of the day and then I usually drink,

93
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,240
you know,
pretty much to access

94
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,860
every single night of my life. So, I mean,

95
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm not saying this is a good thing and
I'm certainly not bragging because I see

96
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:51,030
people that are sober and I get
jealous of him. I'm like, wow,

97
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,020
what would that be like to
wake up feeling good every day?

98
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,700
And I'm so to it. I don't
understand that. I mean,

99
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:03,400
I don't understand why I won't just
let it go. Uh, but it's, you know,

100
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,370
I know it's such a big part of, you know
who, who, who people perceive me to be,

101
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:10,970
but it's also just a big part
of how I perceive me to be.

102
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,120
Well people who perceives you to be,
they perceive you.

103
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,240
Like if anyone has ever asked me, what's
Ron white like or what do you think?

104
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:21,830
He's like, oh great guy likes to
drink a lot. Always funny. Yeah,

105
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,250
that's him. That's what you, you,

106
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,390
you have the benefit of,
you don't have a,

107
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,060
an act like you're not putting on an act,

108
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,800
but you are a character like that.
But as who you are,

109
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,900
it's so much better.

110
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,940
Like if people found out you
were some tee total and got like,

111
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:45,320
have you ever seen somebody drinks fake
shots on stage? Yeah. That's rough.

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,330
That's a rough place to be pretending to
be. Boozing it up with the Oud. C'Mon.

113
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,200
We'll foster Brooks,
who was the best

114
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,350
Vosburg who's so good at being
a drunk with a teetotaler

115
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,420
Dean Martin as well. Not as he told me,
but he didn't pretend. I don't think so.

116
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,030
And I hear that, but I've, I've seen
him, when I did the Foxworthy roast,

117
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:10,170
I went back and watched
all those rows and uh,

118
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,560
that guy was drunk and if
you go watch movies, he was
in, he was not a good actor.

119
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,510
So he was acting in Him and frost
foster Brooks were in the same one.

120
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,050
And Brooks was just so
good and so edgy and uh,

121
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,360
but you could tell which one
was really drunk. And, uh,

122
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,070
I think a lot of times in Vegas he
might've had fake drinks and you know,

123
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,730
or maybe people just wanted to say that
because it's a little story, right? Yeah.

124
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,420
But he looked like a, you
know, he was fucked up to me.

125
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,460
Have you seen that show on a, I don't
know if you watch any of Amazon prime.

126
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,060
You ever seen that show? The Marvelous
Mrs Maizel. It's about a standup comic

127
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,340
now. I see. I hear about it all the time
and people are always saying, it's really,

128
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,340
really good. It's fucking
great. That's fucking,

129
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,650
I just finished a something today.
So, uh, I'm looking for the next,

130
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,350
the watch that man, especially
season one, season one just to see.

131
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,060
Season two was great too.
I enjoyed it,

132
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,330
but people didn't give season two as
much reward as much props as they did.

133
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,740
I liked both seasons, but there's a
woman in that was my point who has an,

134
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,830
she's putting on an act like she's this
really high Falutin lady who pretends to

135
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,530
be this chick from queens and
she puts on a fat suit and,

136
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:31,490
and does this act and a,
it drives Mrs May's.

137
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:35,780
We'll fucking crazy. She hates it. And
she talked shit about her and it starts,

138
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,990
spoiler alert, I won't
say anymore, but it just,

139
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,540
that trap of being a character,
right.

140
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,890
Pretending to be something that
you're not, you know, I think that,

141
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,050
and this might be

142
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,970
a little bit of a stretch, Joe, I
don't know. But you know, it is.

143
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,460
I think that's why Steve Martin and quit
because it was a parody of a comedian

144
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,370
and which was brilliant
and, and so funny. Uh,

145
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,730
let's get small was one of my favorite
albums ever and I took it with me

146
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:06,091
everywhere.

147
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:09,270
I went in and played it for people and
then took credit for how good it was,

148
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,870
even though I really had very little to
do with it except for spending the money.

149
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,010
I remember when I was a kid, I listened
to that long before I ever did stand up.

150
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,580
He was fucking great. Right?
But damn, he was great. But he,

151
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:25,710
and he was doing 45,000 people a
night when he can, when he quit.

152
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,820
Yeah. I think that was the problem.
I think he just got over a, he,

153
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,430
I think he's like a lot of comedians.

154
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,920
They feel a lot, you know,
they're not numb people.

155
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:42,880
They feel a lot. I think for him like
this, that's why I'm drinking it. Right.

156
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,920
Maybe I don't want to get in
touch with those feelings. Well,

157
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,110
everybody that's damaged feels a lot and
everybody has the common cause damaged,

158
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,160
you know? And I think with
that, I think with Steve Martin,

159
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,720
he was just so big, man, I don't think,
I think he's bigger than you are.

160
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:04,800
I combined like he just would go on
stage and they would go fucking crazy.

161
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:09,420
It didn't even make sense to
people. Right. So difficult
for him to perform. Yeah.

162
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:12,870
He didn't know what was funny
anymore. And uh, yeah. So I think,

163
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:17,190
I mean it was a ballsy thing to
do. Fucking crazy. And um, but,

164
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:20,450
and then he walked straight
into film and, you know, it's,

165
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,720
everything he's done has been
crazy, crazy successful. No, he's,

166
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,350
he's excellent. And I'd love to go
see the band. Uh, Cathy Nelson and my,

167
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,630
okay. I think runs the touring thing. Uh,

168
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,500
she would see the band and went back
and talked to him and said it was great.

169
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,340
Wow. I like to meet him. He lived at,

170
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:44,300
we lived in the same town for a while
and I'd like to meet her, but, uh, uh,

171
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:47,760
I never ran into him. Ran Into Jonathan
Winters there a couple of times.

172
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,950
What was he like? He was holding
court at the post office and, uh,

173
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,320
it like 20 people around.
He's doing characters,

174
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,770
he's killing it at the post office.
And I saw,

175
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,120
and that was the second time I saw him.

176
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:03,270
The first time I saw him was he was
having lunch by himself and, uh,

177
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,550
and I was with another comic and he goes,

178
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,680
do you think he'd mind if we
went over there and said hi?

179
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,350
And hour later we were like,
well, we gotta go. We gotta split.

180
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,720
It was Robin's big influence.
Right, right. Yeah. That's a,

181
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,490
yeah, that's true. He was so,

182
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,760
he was so who the fuck was like him?
Think of that.

183
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,090
Yeah. It had to start with
something. Right. That's what I got.

184
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,790
I got this theory that uh, there's, uh,

185
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,180
two kinds of comics bridge builders and
people that walk across those bridges.

186
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,910
I'm a big walker. Yeah. I didn't
invent any of this stuff. I think,

187
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:48,750
uh, well you got to go back to
like Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce.

188
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,300
Those are the big ones.
And then Kennison is a big one.

189
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:54,040
Kennison because Kennison taught us that

190
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,360
somebody can genuinely not like you
and you can still make them on. Yeah.

191
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,180
Well he also taught me that you
can punch down as low as you want,

192
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,080
as long as it's funny.
Right. As long as it's funny.

193
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:07,550
As long as you're good enough fucking bit
that he had about starving children to

194
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,384
this day.

195
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,690
I had an argument with a
guy on the podcast about it
when he was telling me that

196
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,540
you comedy only punches up I go,
that's crazy.

197
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,930
Kennison had two of the best bits of
all time. They're both punching down.

198
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,410
One was about starving kids.
The other was about necrophiliac money,

199
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,470
banked corpses. But that's his down
as he can get me a fucking dead body.

200
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,870
And both those bits where fucking genius.
And it's the same with the,

201
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,460
it's the same with nine 11.
You know,

202
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,270
if you're good enough of a rider,

203
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,860
you can do material about that. But
if, but if, but you better be good.

204
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,770
You better have somewhere to go. That is,
yeah, you better have somewhere to go.

205
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:50,890
And I heard a couple of good pieces, I
don't remember who did them, but you know,

206
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,240
uh, but like the week
afterwards, the guy that, uh,

207
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,590
it was some guy that was the opening act
was trying to riff on it and I got him

208
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:03,450
over to the side and I said, hey dude,
not a, this is my stage right here.

209
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:06,190
And normally I don't tell it
the comics what to do. Uh,

210
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,820
but until you have something to say
about it, that's uh, that's really,

211
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:13,150
really funny. I don't want
you to bring it up. Yeah,

212
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,840
that's a tough one because you could
kill the whole show some middle that goes

213
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:21,970
on and you lost friends in the towers. And
that was a week ago. All right. I mean,

214
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:25,460
not,
there's like levels of tragedy.

215
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,250
That's a real tough one to find humor in.

216
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,710
I'm not saying that someone can't do it.
There's people,

217
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,530
people find comedy in everywhere
and it's legit. They do. Right.

218
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,280
They have a perspective.
It's just the I, you know,

219
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:40,810
how good are you going
to avoid those things?

220
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,420
That's how good I am. I get it. I
get it. I'm not good enough to do it.

221
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,900
Patrice O'neil had a really
great point about that.

222
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,450
He's like all things when
someone's trying to be funny,

223
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,970
they all come from the same place.
Just some of them miss.

224
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,690
Some of them just aren't funny.
You can't get mad at those. Right,

225
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,950
because it came from the same place like,
yeah,

226
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,210
I bet someone would admit that they
told a joke that wasn't funny. Whoops.

227
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,950
Tried. They tried but they didn't. They're
not trying to be mean like the, the,

228
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,460
the response. Sometimes it just
didn't work. Yeah, it just sucked.

229
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,880
But you know when someone's Ad Lib
and some things are going to suck,

230
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:17,690
but the response sometimes to
one that's like ow off, you know,

231
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,220
it will maybe a little bit too
harsh or maybe a little too soon.

232
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,740
Like people get so fucking mad.

233
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,690
Well, you sent me a tweet about
that Cosby bit that I did and uh,

234
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,180
and it was really funny. And uh, but it,

235
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,830
it just stirred the pot so much like
you, you think rape is good? No,

236
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:41,270
that's not what I said it all. That's
not what I said at all. I made a joke.

237
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:46,130
That's it. Uh, and, and
you do that too. I mean,

238
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:50,560
you stir up the pot big time. It's
great. And you'll just go watch this and

239
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,610
a
of point though.

240
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,680
And if you have a point and you,

241
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:02,120
you really are trying real hard to be
a good person. You just have a point.

242
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,810
I just have a point on things. I'm
going to say it. No, you might,

243
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:08,900
you might get mad, but I'm, I'm
not saying it to be a bad guy.

244
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,430
I'm saying it because this
is what I do for a living.

245
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,280
So I do thought we find things.
You know,

246
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,400
bear was telling me that he did a
Carolines in New York City. He's like,

247
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,890
it was almost like a college gig.
He's like,

248
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,140
people are so sensitive now in New York.

249
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,870
Oh, you know, he and I just did a,
the VFW hall and Hollywood, and, uh,

250
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,810
then, uh, the it,

251
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,470
and I was calling him about
another comic that I wanted.

252
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:37,470
I was just talking to the bar and
thought he was really funny. Uh,

253
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,480
and I now can't remember his name.
Uh,

254
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,370
Joe Derosa the road.

255
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,530
And I called him and he goes, yeah, no,
he's really good. And, uh, and, and,

256
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:53,590
uh, he goes, how about I come over and do
it? And I'm like, well, of course, Bill,

257
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:56,650
whatever you want to do, time
on it. Come on over. Well,

258
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,360
he was doing a bunch of Trump
stuff and, and uh, you know,

259
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,440
and I guarantee, and my fans are
pretty split down the middle,

260
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,320
but it did not go over well.

261
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:12,610
And he didn't give a feelers fun about it.

262
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,560
And, uh, so he just made them mad and
stirred them up for about 20 minutes.

263
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,910
And then we both did my sat and we
smoked a cigar. And, uh, he, you know,

264
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,090
he's not drinking either for like a year.

265
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Yeah. He looks great. He looks really
good. He looks thin and healthy. Yeah.

266
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,620
Yeah. That, that's Trump jokes
or interesting because, uh,

267
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:37,460
I don't remember anybody getting
mad at you for Bush jokes.

268
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,700
Right. It's different. Just
jokes, right? Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,040
Even if you were like a Bush supporter,

270
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,220
you could crack a joke about the way he
spells potato or something like that and

271
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:49,460
nobody gave a fuck. They didn't
care. It was a different thing.

272
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,060
Even if people were supporting Bush, by
the way that spelled potato wrong. Oh,

273
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,940
that's where I was quail. Well
that's right. That's right.

274
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:58,660
That's how these rumors get started,
man. Is I don't think it's data.

275
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,620
You conspiracy dude blowing off this.
Who spelled potato wrong shit.

276
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,510
Oh, that's right. It was him. Um, Bush to
fuck some things up too though, didn't he?

277
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,950
Well, didn't you fucking stuff
up? There's the whole album,

278
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:16,280
like the wit and wisdom of George W.
Bush and he says like, fool me once.

279
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,460
Shame on you. Shame on
me again. I don't know.

280
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,690
You know what's interesting about Bush
is when he was running for governor of

281
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,900
Texas, he had a completely
different way of communicating.

282
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,030
He talked like a really smart guy. He's
very articulate. I mean he was smooth,

283
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:36,560
smooth talk like arguments.
W W is a video of him,

284
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,300
but from back in the day when he was
running for governor and he's great,

285
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,870
you listen to him like glue, this
energetic, intelligent guys articulate.

286
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,910
He seems like one of us.
And then there's,

287
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:50,250
they had a side by side video
comparing to like Bush after seven

288
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,970
years in office and he's barely hanging
on right. Cause I pay attention to shit.

289
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:57,390
He's given the reins to heaven
and Hell to Dick Cheney,

290
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,650
Dick Cheney's in a bunker, seven miles
underground making the Ferris decisions.

291
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,640
You know, I mean it was
weird. It was a weird time.

292
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:08,190
But you can make fun of Bush all day long.
Nobody give a fuck.

293
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,290
You make fun of Trump today.

294
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,470
Kill you. Yeah. I almost got in a
scuffle the other day at the gas station.

295
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,620
This guy just starts spouting out stuff.

296
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:20,500
He was putting gas in this car ride
over there and [inaudible] and just,

297
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,500
and by the first word that consent is
that came out of his mouth from nowhere,

298
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:26,310
hadn't said a word of the guy.
Didn't say hi to him. Nothing.

299
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,790
Nancy Polosi is a dumbest person that
ever lived on this planet. And, and,

300
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,160
and I get baited so easy.
I just said probably not.

301
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,010
Probably not that you're probably wrong.
She's probably not.

302
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,380
Obama was an idiot.
He graduated number one from Harvard law.

303
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:50,760
So yeah, views politically
aside, we can start with,

304
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:55,380
he's probably not stupid.
And what a good speaker.

305
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,540
He was the best. Oh yeah, it was smooth.

306
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,820
Most presidential,
he was a,

307
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,990
he was a guy that you were happy to have
represent you whether he'd believe with,

308
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,530
you know,

309
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,530
believe in him and support his ideas are
not as a representative of our culture

310
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,170
of our civilization. That guy was
smooth and measured and articulate and,

311
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,093
and off the book,

312
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,420
you know, most of the time,
but you know, he was just,

313
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,510
he was saying what he thought and he
wasn't reading off a scripted, well,

314
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:29,150
you have a story about
Clinton w I know, I know. So,

315
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,500
oh well,
being off the book,

316
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:35,070
Clinton was such a good orator
that the teleprompter went off.

317
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:39,810
It broke like five minutes into his
fucking speech and he did all that shit by

318
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,810
memory. Just did the whole
God damn thing by memory.

319
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,690
And I played nine holes of golf with
him. What was it like and uh, it was,

320
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,380
well, there's still security
secret service all around him.

321
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,060
And so it was a private golf course.
Uh,

322
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:01,040
Larry Ellison a that
owns oracle. Oh Wow. Uh,

323
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,680
owns this private golf course.
It has 14, he's a big tennis guy,

324
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:08,840
so he puts on the tennis stuff out in
palm springs and nobody plays his course

325
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,270
and he doesn't play golf. And, uh, Eh,

326
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,870
it's just his private as a
deal [inaudible] course. Yeah.

327
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:15,860
He's got his own courses.

328
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,680
He played through our group and
shadow creek and Beverly Hill,

329
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:26,530
I mean in, in Vegas. It really exclusive,
of course, impossible to get on. And,

330
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:29,660
and he was playing by himself and
he was gone the tee box. And I said,

331
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,990
as lonely at the top.
And Larry, he goes, yeah.

332
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,330
And he was balling and went
off by himself. And uh, but
he wasn't even there, but,

333
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:41,540
but Clinton was,
and he told me a story goes,

334
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,600
his friend of his a record
producer rap records big.

335
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,060
I didn't tell him who it was and
didn't tell me who the artist was,

336
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,070
but the artist

337
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,780
was all dugged out and he was in a Ferrari
store and, and uh, and uh, the salesman,

338
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:56,830
it goes, are you thinking about
buying this car? And the guy goes, no,

339
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,620
I'm going to buy the car.
I'm thinking about pussy.

340
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,200
So the Glen told me a story that had the
word buzzy in it and a Clinton Clinton

341
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:14,620
told me that that's a great fucking story.
That is a great story.

342
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,260
That poor bastard.
It's almost like a comic.

343
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,460
Like he could just be free.

344
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,980
He got divorced and just started
going on the honest direct Clinton.

345
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,380
I did. I didn't want to either.
Again, I was going to do,

346
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,750
what would you do? Would you do, you're in
my position. Would you do, you're smart.

347
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,000
You know,
you don't got the 40 years left to live.

348
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,090
How to shove my packer right in her mouth.

349
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:47,980
That's what the whole idea of being the
fucking number one guy you gotta be so

350
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:50,470
Goddamn Pussy hungry to want
to be the number one guy.

351
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,680
100% you've got to have big appetites,
that's for sure. For everything. Yeah.

352
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,180
For everything. For everything. And
that'd be a super conqueror. Yeah.

353
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,300
And all those guys aren't seeing,
not all of those guys,

354
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:03,100
I don't want to generalize,
but, but it's really,

355
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:08,101
really common for men that are in power
positions to just be horny as fuck.

356
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,330
Yeah. All the time. Of course. I mean,

357
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,290
we've got to go back the way
we want these people to behave.

358
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,610
It's so contrary to the way any
king ever behaved ever in history.

359
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,630
Like the stories of kings throughout
history. It was always decadence.

360
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,630
It was always,
you know,

361
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,180
all these women and why is food and more
food and the feeding them valves open

362
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:35,680
sores and cutting off the
fucking ex wives heads and shit.

363
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,360
That's what you think of ordering armies,
people protecting them. He's like,

364
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:45,390
those people were just gluttons
the super gluttons of the world.

365
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,990
Right. And we don't like that. Like it.

366
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,720
So then we tried to turn someone into some
fucking Norman Rockwell person. Right.

367
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:56,790
And that doesn't work either
because you don't have enough,
uh, you, you don't, you,

368
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,010
you don't have enough charisma
to lead. Maybe, you know,

369
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,910
Trump is showing us that like you
could talk shit about him 24, seven,

370
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:08,860
365 days a year. He's not adjusting
anything. In fact, he digs his heels in.

371
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:13,240
He says, same fucking guy. No
matter what happens. Well, you know,

372
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,030
I really don't like to get into
manifestation on throb because it,

373
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,930
and the reason is I just don't feel like
it's my job and I feel like it's your

374
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:27,690
job. My job is different. My job is
to go up there and just, you know,

375
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,180
meg, I'm laughing, but I don't want
to be divisive. Yeah. Here, you know,

376
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:35,320
I just don't want to do it because it's,
my fan base is split and you know,

377
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:39,280
I've had, uh, and, and you know,
nothing ever really happens,

378
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:43,870
but I had a guy one time we here that
said something to meet and greet who is

379
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:47,210
paid to take a picture me and then
refused to take a picture of me because of

380
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:49,810
what I said. And I'm like,
I don't give a fuck to,

381
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:54,410
we don't take a picture leave that.
I don't give a shit. People. Yeah,

382
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,070
but you know that's also one of the,
it's like they're exerting power over you.

383
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,170
Take a picture. I'm going to unfollow
you on Instagram too. Ron White, right?

384
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,850
God Damn Communists. What am I going
to do? That's the one girl. She said,

385
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:10,690
I'm now I'm going to unfollow. You
used to be funny, but now you're just,

386
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,810
I'm going to unfollow you and I
know it doesn't matter. And I said,

387
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:16,400
you can't leave.
All the plants will die

388
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,620
whenever you're in a bind.
Quote Bill Murray.

389
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,150
Yeah. People are just so mean. It's one to
hurt you, Ron white for no reason. Yeah,

390
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:29,984
but nobody,

391
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,820
I've already been as mad as I can
be and I'll never be mad at her.

392
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:39,080
And it happened when I was 16 years old,
so it's hard to make me mad.

393
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:42,710
And I'll tell you what made me mad.
I just got my driver's license.

394
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,870
My mother asked me to go to
the store to get something.

395
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,440
It's in the summer in Houston.
I don't have any shoes on. Oh,

396
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:51,410
my door step into a shitty pampers.

397
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,790
There's somebody just thrown in the
parking lot and I didn't just put a toe in

398
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:01,430
and go, oh, that's baby
shit. That's wrong. I just
showed my whole foot into it.

399
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:04,430
Green baby shit coming through my toes.

400
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,750
Smears all over the diaper.
Right. So I'm stuck.

401
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,220
I don't know what to do.

402
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,760
I'm not going to get back in my
mother's car with these shitty food.

403
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:16,970
I can't go into the store with
baby shit all over my foot.

404
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,860
And I thought about just cutting my
foot off and just leave it in the diaper

405
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:25,580
with a note that said, you should use to
be a perfectly good fucking foot dude.

406
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,000
And nobody's ever made me that mad sense.

407
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,300
I was so fucking furious and I just
wanted to hate and kill over a shitty

408
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,800
pamper. That's crazy that that was
all it took. That's all it took.

409
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,040
That's all it took. But it was so
w you know it just put me in a,

410
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,990
I've been stuck before. Let me tell
you about the other time I was stuck.

411
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,710
This will get us off of politics.
Um,

412
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,530
I'm in my tour bus and,
uh,

413
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,410
I'm partying with my buddy
Steve and my best friend,

414
00:25:57,411 --> 00:26:01,190
my road manager who passed away and,
and he never gets laid,

415
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:03,470
but it looked like he had
an angle on this girl.

416
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,640
So I picked up my beer and went back
to my bedroom, which I never do.

417
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,640
I sit up there and drink with the guys
and I go back there to just to go to

418
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:13,550
sleep. But I didn't ever take
booze back there or anything in it.

419
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,420
But I'd gone back there and laid down
and I put that Doseck he's bottle on the

420
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:22,880
counter and then we took off during the
night while I was real drunk and Steve

421
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,180
was real drunk and the bottle falls
off and breaks and I don't hear it.

422
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,510
So in the middle of the night and my bed
sits high cause you want to try to get

423
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:33,140
those beds towards them center, uh,
cause it's on those axles anyway.

424
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:36,920
But the closer it is to the center of
the better it feels when you're in it.

425
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,150
So you kind of slide off
of it about an inch. And I,

426
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,180
my foot went into the bottom, the beer
bottle at a shard hanging off of it,

427
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:49,800
about an inch and a half long. And
uh, and I just, and I landed on it.

428
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:53,190
Well now I know exactly
what it was and uh,

429
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,630
and somebody had hit the master
lights so I can't turn the lights on.

430
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:00,030
You have to go back and turn them on,
on the master switch.

431
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,570
But I know that around me is broken
glass everywhere cause I understand what

432
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:09,240
happened. I understand that bottle
fell broke and I got it in my foot.

433
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,460
So I pull them up foot up and I didn't
know how big the Shard was and I just

434
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:19,140
pull it out of there and blood just
starts gushing out with Steve's passed out

435
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:22,980
in a bunk and he can't hear me. I
can't get to a phone. I can't see.

436
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,180
So what do I do? I just crawl back
in bed and went to sleep and bled.

437
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,940
And Steve said the next morning it looked
like somebody killed a hog and learn

438
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,190
and uh,
he's lifted up the sheets.

439
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:38,430
Even the bus driver saw my foot
and they were like, alright,

440
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,110
this the price.
Did you worry about bleeding out?

441
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,271
What else to do?

442
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:49,980
Cause then the only option was to take
another step and cut the other foot.

443
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,930
And uh, do you have your phone
with you? I wasn't within reach.

444
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,740
I was just stuck and I was also drunk.

445
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,630
Stuck in drunk it bleeding. Damn.
That's a good combination. Yeah. Yeah.

446
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:06,210
I was stumped. I didn't know what to do.
I didn't know how to fucking combative,

447
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,130
so I would just crawl back in bed
and I'm like, no, is your foot oh,

448
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,720
13 stitches. Uh, as soon as
I woke up and looked at him,

449
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:20,070
let's call the hospital guys.
And uh, things sewed it back up,

450
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:23,710
13 on the bottom of my foot, right
in the arch. And uh, it was uh,

451
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,440
it was mess. It was a fucking mess.
Every time if you fuck your foot up,

452
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:30,430
you realize how much you need them.
Like,

453
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,120
you could fuck your
shoulder up and that sucks,

454
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,080
but you can still walk somewhere and get
something or other foot up. You're like,

455
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,020
oh, okay, this is, this is a real problem

456
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,410
operation or something. Put every, I
played golf every day, so, oh yeah.

457
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,750
So it's a real problem. The
real problem with me, every day,

458
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,430
every day, I can, not every day,

459
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:58,020
but every day I can golf is one of those
games mad God guys just get fucking

460
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:02,250
into cough. Eh, it's, you know,
it's, you know, look at it,

461
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:03,600
look at what you're into.
You know,

462
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,520
it's something that you do and
you've always done and you just,

463
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,760
you just keep doing it. You know, back
then it, I've watched it on television,

464
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:14,760
like as a soap opera,
I just watched 80 hours of the players.

465
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,210
It also gives me a reason not to exercise,
you know,

466
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:22,980
cause I got this golf to watch.
Golf does give you some exercise though.

467
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:26,240
That's a fact. You are walking
better than being sedentary. Yeah.

468
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,240
You're walking around and you think in,
you know, and you're planning shit out.

469
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,630
Looking at the curves of the thinking,

470
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Ras and measuring that we're trying
to work out solve problems and so,

471
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:42,040
um, I get it. I'm just
terrified. Terrified. I'll be

472
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,420
one of you guys out there every
day. Yeah. Right. No, I know.

473
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,270
I have friends that go out every day.
You can do one of them,

474
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,210
but I know other guys I do too.
Every time they get a chance.

475
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,350
The guys I play with Google every
day. Yeah. If you can pull it off,

476
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,010
it's like a gentleman's leisure
way of life. Yeah. You know,

477
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,790
it's always back when I was a club comic,
that's how I killed the day.

478
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,630
Got started playing when I was like 13
and so I would just go to a golf course

479
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,810
and you know, schmooze out a deal where
I could play golf to her every day.

480
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:14,820
And you ain't Jack Shit to do during the
day and clubs for 15 years. You know,

481
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,040
I'm doing 48 weeks and make it 500 a
week or whatever it was when I started.

482
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:23,170
And it was a middle act out there.

483
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,010
You had to work them all cause
you deeded it to $500 real bad.

484
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,890
Do you ever look back on those days?
Like you reminisce? I, you know what, I,

485
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,803
it's,

486
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,400
it's a good thing for me that this
was the path of least resistance,

487
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,750
right? Cause uh, it was
really one for stand up.

488
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:48,460
I'd be a regional marijuana distributor
in the state of Texas and, uh, in a,

489
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,810
in an industry that has some
questions coming up. So, uh, you know,

490
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:57,730
I did it because I loved it,
but it was also fun, fun,

491
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,690
fun, you know. Uh, and uh,

492
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,730
and it was easy for me.

493
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:08,731
I didn't mind the travel because
I like drinking free and bars and,

494
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,990
and uh, and, and, you know,
practicing this art form and,

495
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,940
you know, and I, but I never ever
thought it would go where it went.

496
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,870
You know, if, you know, people ask
me, well, how do I do that? I'm like,

497
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,020
I don't know how I did it.
And that was right there when it happened.

498
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,140
I have no idea.
I barely remember it.

499
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,540
But did you live in
Mexico for a little bit?

500
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,260
In fact is a really,
really,

501
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:39,820
really good PGA player from
the same town I lived in, uh,

502
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,140
played golf every day where I played golf.
I didn't know him.

503
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,180
He was young. He would have
been, let's figure it out.

504
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,500
It would've, he would've been, he's
like 21 or two now. And, uh, he was,

505
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,620
he was on the, in the heat for
this tournament. Uh, Abraham,

506
00:31:57,621 --> 00:32:00,310
my answer is his name and,
uh,

507
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,670
born and right now some Mexico waves was
actually born across the border because

508
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,090
there's no wall. Right. They can just
come over there and have a baby so that,

509
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,650
but his parents must've been fairly
well off for that part of the world,

510
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,140
you know, to, to do that. But he's
great. He's great and not dig it because,

511
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:20,230
uh, I, you know, and I see where
he came from exactly. You know,

512
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,320
it's where my son made a hole in
one when he was eight years old,

513
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,220
was on the capacitor and
golf course in Reynosa,

514
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:27,670
Mexico holds and one does
a guy getting his career.

515
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:34,380
Uh,
I've had one of my sons had one.

516
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:39,220
And you know it like the
big guys, maybe 16, 17, 18,

517
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:44,270
a whole lot in a whole lifetime
does no equivalent in other sports.

518
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,020
Yeah. Went all in one. There's no
equivalent in any other game right there.

519
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,800
There was a double eagle.
The uh, what's that mean?

520
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,560
That's where you make a two on a par five.

521
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,220
So that means you sunk a whole
from to 60 to 262 yards out.

522
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:05,540
You made it on the second shot.
Oh Wow. There's rare. Very rare.

523
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,980
Very rare.

524
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,980
But legal slightly less rare
than Hohenwarter way less rare.

525
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,690
Way less rare because the whole,

526
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,060
because at part three could be
as much as 125 yards, you know?

527
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:24,530
And then most of Martin made on the
longer one 85. But you know, you're not,

528
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,580
the guys like me aren't hitting
the par three from two 35.

529
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,720
And if you think about it,

530
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,780
I guess there's nothing like that in
any other game or sport in one where it

531
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:40,160
just works out perfect.
Maybe your walk off Grand Slam or yeah,

532
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:43,650
maybe it does happen way more often
than that. Way More. Well, yeah,

533
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,450
way more often than Holland. One for
how many people try it every, you know,

534
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:50,690
you don't get many chances
at that Grand Slam,

535
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:54,470
but try and have anything
make pitch at you.

536
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,170
You're definitely gonna hit the ball.
It's right there.

537
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,650
Like that golf ball is just right there.
I mean, you might not have a good lay,

538
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,250
but you're definitely going to hit it. And
I say it on the right shit. Well, yeah.

539
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,250
Well if you hit a foul ball, you got
to play it. You got to go find it.

540
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,970
And it's just,

541
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,040
it seems like the odds of you getting
a hole in one must be off the charts.

542
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,370
It must be like a thousand
to one or a hundred thousand.

543
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:18,620
A one or something crazy like
that. Yeah, maybe. I mean,

544
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,660
but most people may maybe never,
you know,

545
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:22,940
what do you think the numbers
numbers would be? What are the odds?

546
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,490
Oh fuck to own one.
I didn't graduate.

547
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,960
Let's throw the math to those carb
guys. So signs do, they were killing me.

548
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,120
Yes.

549
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,800
Sign made one the 11th day ever played
golf in front of me and his coach and his

550
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:40,634
best friend.

551
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,260
And it was a 95 yard par three from the
regular women's teas where the u s kids

552
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:51,260
club, a driver that I
still have. Wow. And uh,

553
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,010
and it just straight at the hall.
He had a great golf swing. The kids,

554
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:55,960
if you treat him or he's,

555
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,760
his golf coach was good even though
they spoke a different language, they,

556
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,530
they understood golf and
how to teach him that swing.

557
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:06,230
And so he was good at it and he
didn't really play much anymore.

558
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,320
He decided staying but uh,

559
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,650
planted 10 yards in front of the Pan,

560
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,070
bounced twice roller right in
the middle of the cup. And I,

561
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,520
at this point I'd been playing golf for
30 years and I'd never done it. And uh,

562
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,810
so it was a big deal.

563
00:35:20,811 --> 00:35:23,750
And he got his name and a couple of
newspapers and they mentioned him on the

564
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:24,560
golf channel.

565
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,810
He was the youngest kid that had
made a hole in one that year that was

566
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:29,030
registered.
And then like two weeks later,

567
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:32,070
his six year old did it unless
I was like, uh, you know,

568
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,010
they took all the joy out of it for
him. That was one kid. He was lucky. He,

569
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,790
his window on off a mailbox here, you're
just winning off a perfect golf shot,

570
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,400
golf shot. That's a hard thing to
learn, right. That swing, Eh, you know,

571
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,770
it is a really difficult thing
to do and it's, it's just a,

572
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,810
it's a thing that you learn how to aim
it. It's like a bow and Arrow, you know,

573
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,880
uh, even though that's a little
easier to teach somebody how to do,

574
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,880
but to do it exceptionally
well, you know, it's, it, it's,

575
00:36:04,881 --> 00:36:08,830
it's not easy to do and a and,
or a sling shot,

576
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:11,310
how to get the power at the right spot or,

577
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,130
or even flat casting is
not power everywhere. It,

578
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,860
its power in the right spot that does
it. And the risks. Yeah. And, uh,

579
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,360
so it's, it's, it's hard to do,

580
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:26,340
but it's fun to do once you,
once you,

581
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:30,750
once you learn how to hit a good solid
golf shot and the ball comes off the way

582
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:34,800
it's supposed to, it's, you know, it's
bliss. I'll tell you something. Here's,

583
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:39,060
here's the story about golf.
My best friend who passed
away died of brain cancer.

584
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:44,061
So they had done a surgery on him that
he had just down scars down his neck,

585
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:48,190
down his back where they were trying
to harbor. They were, you know,

586
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,760
they were shooting it, you know,
he was already, you know, he had,

587
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,600
he should have had a death sentence.
We just weren't saying it out loud.

588
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,590
And we were, uh, at my
place in Montecito and, uh,

589
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,590
we had thrown everything at this cancer,

590
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:06,060
but the kitchen sink and we were looking
for the fucking saying know, and uh,

591
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,080
and it, Steve Goes, let's go
golf course, man. Uh, he goes,

592
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:12,420
I'll help you read some putts.
He was always good at reading putz.

593
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:14,190
We'd been playing golf
since we were a little kid.

594
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:18,150
We'd known each other since
we were six. And, uh, and, uh,

595
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,790
so when I got my clubs out,
his clubs were in there too.

596
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:27,050
So he reaches into his pill bag and
takes another pill of pain pill and said,

597
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,900
I'll throw mine on there, you
know, I might take a swing. So,

598
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,570
and he did off the first tee box and
it hurt and it wasn't very good. And,

599
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:39,570
uh, and, and he just went and, uh,

600
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,420
but every once in a while he'd
put a ball down and he'd hit it.

601
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:46,920
And we get to the 17th holes,
part 367 yards as long. Oh.

602
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,390
And he hits his drive with his,
with his driver and, and, and uh,

603
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,600
and it fades off a little bit to the
right, but he caught it. And, uh,

604
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:57,750
so it was up kind of by the world,
by the green,

605
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,140
but the pen was kind of on the other side.
And I was like, great. You know, that.

606
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:05,250
And, uh, and so he hits a chip
shot, which is easier to do.

607
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:09,270
And he's always really been good at that.
And he hits it to about seven feet.

608
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:14,130
And I'm like, oh my God, he's
got a seven foot putt for par.

609
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,700
And He makes it and this dying man gets
the biggest grant I've ever seen in my

610
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:25,680
alive. And it was crooked
because his muscles had been cut,

611
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,920
but it just brought him pure fucking joy.

612
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,160
And then I got to see the last
part he ever made. So, and uh,

613
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:36,370
I got to witness that, you know,
joy. So that's pretty cool. Awesome.

614
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,250
That's pretty cool. That's
golf, you know, it, you know,

615
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,960
with it means that much to you.
You know,

616
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:43,600
he can make you feel better if you
do it right. One that I get it.

617
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,810
I think it's like in any
difficult game like that,

618
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,150
I guess it'd be like
that with a lot of games.

619
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,540
But there's something about golf too that
it's very physical and you're doing it

620
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,470
outside. It's one of the only things you
have to do outside, you know, other than,

621
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,280
I guess you could do tennis
inside, like really, right.

622
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,370
But golf is a fucking giant ass course.
You're going to be walking,

623
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,930
you got to go outside. I'd do it in
a golf cart, but you know, I walk,

624
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:12,430
I walk from the golf cart to the ball. So
that's happening. Something's going on.

625
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:14,980
Something's going on, but
you to stay loose. You know,

626
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:19,040
that's why it has the only
reason that I do yoga, it is a,

627
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,610
is to keep my lower back and my,
you know,

628
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:26,460
keep everything moving around back.
Right. Yeah. Well it's just got,

629
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,650
it's all got to turn, you know,
around your spine and that, you know,

630
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,990
I'm 62 years old and uh,

631
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,540
and so that's just harder to do
it unless you keep, you know,

632
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,070
you got to keep those muscles stretched
out, uh, to be able to do it at all.

633
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,581
Yeah.

634
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:46,570
I think it's like that with the anything
where you're moving your body as a unit

635
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,680
martial arts stuff or anything, you
better as you get older and particularly,

636
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,910
you better be really aware

637
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,860
of all the moving parts. When you're a
kid, you could just fucking hit the gas.

638
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,250
When you hit 50, you better be, you know,

639
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:03,770
you're swinging a tennis racket
or something like that. You,

640
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,960
it'd be aware of your shoulders.
And your knees.

641
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,480
Where have all these moving parts?
How old are you?

642
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,400
51 51 well wait, wait, wait
for 62. I'm not waiting.

643
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:19,970
What's up? Here's tiger and tiger's back
injury. He's had four back surgeries.

644
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,150
Oh No. He had another one. I, this
isn't like yesterday or anything,

645
00:40:23,151 --> 00:40:25,040
but this is from a oh good.

646
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,100
Why has announced that he had undergone
anterior Lumbar interbody fusion?

647
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,400
Oh, that's fusing his Dick's. Many
thoughts. Many thought is disc. Excuse me.

648
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:36,801
Hello.

649
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,280
Hey Roy and Joe and many thought that
is competitive golf career was over and

650
00:40:40,281 --> 00:40:45,281
his fourth surgery since March of 2014
which involved removing the l five s one

651
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,220
intervertebral disc

652
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:55,520
fusion material to connect
the l five and s one vertebra.

653
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:58,310
At what?
Oh my God.

654
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:00,890
Although he's apparently recovered
quite well from the operation.

655
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:04,010
This surgery is quite rare
amongst professional golfers.

656
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:07,190
One of the PGA player at
Dudley Heart had also, uh,

657
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,330
had had a fusion in the same location
as woods. Fucking fusions. Rough man.

658
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:12,710
That means there's no disk left.

659
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:17,530
Right. And he won the, uh, uh, uh,

660
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,370
the, whatever they call the Fedex Cup
there, the last tournament of the year,

661
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,240
last year, tiger wanted. And so he
came back from that. That's incredible.

662
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,210
Oh it is amazing. And I was there, uh,

663
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:32,410
is it East Lake and Atlanta
and, uh, and I do all their,

664
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,400
all their charity stuff. Yeah. That's the
footage of him going up to 18th green.

665
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,560
He's about to win this
thing. And it's, this is the,

666
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,400
the top 30 golfers on the PGA tour,

667
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,040
which is the toughest tour.
There is these people, Jazz.

668
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,540
And now you're in sport that everybody
gets some run on the field and follow him.

669
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,940
Right. Walk right next to
them. There's no crowd control.

670
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,330
Amnon was right up there that was
right up there above this green.

671
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,390
Uh, cause I, I walked with it cause I
get to go inside the ropes. So, and uh,

672
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,200
and I followed it. A couple of
choked. Nah, it didn't matter.

673
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:08,510
This is the one he needs right
here. The short one. Yup.

674
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,170
And they get a two shot lead
going into that and that's it.

675
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:15,980
And they won and he won the whole thing.
And that was the comeback. You know,

676
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:19,760
that was the comeback that people said
would never happen that he would never,

677
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,000
not especially at this level.
That's a hard tournament to win.

678
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,920
I mean that's a tough,
tough stuff.

679
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,310
Tiger's back the back. I love it.
The require a lot from people.

680
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,430
You know,
if,

681
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:37,431
if they get some strange along the way
he got it rough after his whole divorce

682
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,930
and the sex scandal.
He had it rough for a long time.

683
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,780
People were coming after him.

684
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:50,050
But the thing is about those
back surgeries is a wonder
why they did the fusion

685
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:56,150
cause I think they do articulate and
discs now that seemed to be very effective

686
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:00,470
at I, you know, I think he tried that.
We have to, he had boy he had four. So

687
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:07,850
cause people are, I know a few
people that are doing those. Um,

688
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,920
they've got those discs down.
They put like a titanium movable disk.

689
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,250
Basically it takes the place of the disk.
It's in your back.

690
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:21,180
Eddie Bravo had that done. I
don't know. Was this, that,
you know, I play all these,

691
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,310
um,
okay.

692
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:27,430
Pro Ams increasing offers performance via
an anterior approach is that it spares

693
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:33,410
the large muscles of the back
that are critical to golf swing,

694
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,730
which potentially makes the recovery
for athletes athletes a bit easier. Huh.

695
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,450
I would imagine whoever was looking at
Tiger's back was about the best person in

696
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:46,660
the world to be looking at it.
So I'm sure they would have,

697
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,320
he had a pretty big budget for
it. Yeah. I mean you would want,

698
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,970
I mean they must've like really calculated
it. That was the best move was maybe,

699
00:43:55,971 --> 00:44:00,650
um, if they put an artificial disc you
would, you'd would move funny. I'm good.

700
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,160
I don't know man.
That whole the back things rough one,

701
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,420
you ever had any back problems?

702
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,610
I don't have a lot of any kind of problems
except that little alcohol thing that

703
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:14,100
I got going that little squeaker and uh,

704
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:19,100
but I played golf with guys in these pro
am's and most of them were, you know,

705
00:44:19,101 --> 00:44:19,551
football,

706
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:24,200
basketball players and most of them are
around my age and most of them are in

707
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:26,270
pain. You know, they, it what?

708
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,460
It turns out smoking pot watching
cartoons good for your knees are fine.

709
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,190
And uh, I just didn't get
hurt. You know, I didn't,

710
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,430
I played golf when I was on
the golf team. Yeah, it sucked.

711
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:43,130
But I was on the golf team and junior
high and high school and football too. But

712
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,870
life of relative leisure is good for the
joints. Right. It's good for the joints.

713
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,810
Right? You don't take a pounding. Not
from where I'm laying. Yeah, the fucking,

714
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,330
the knees and the ankles.

715
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:58,500
So we were talking to a Camaro mine
yesterday who's UFC welterweight champion.

716
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:00,000
He's had five knee surgeries.

717
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,450
Both of his knees are basically
bone on bone can't run anymore.

718
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,040
I had all kinds of crazy out.
We'll still fight.

719
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:10,650
Thing destroys people with no to just
fight. He destroys people. He's the best.

720
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,990
He just beat Tyron Woodley
who was the best before him.
It's fucking crazy. I mean

721
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,330
when I laughed so hard when a guy goes,
my balls got high and you go,

722
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,830
there was the best company. The best
thing you could have possibly said was,

723
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,380
I understand that was love that guy.
Oh Man.

724
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,220
Lewis is, he's a, he's a genius.
He figured out a way to be himself.

725
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,480
He forgot his Instagram page. No, no.

726
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,760
If there's anything fucking
crazy going on in the world.

727
00:45:36,761 --> 00:45:40,720
Derek Lewis has it on Instagram.
Page is Instagram page is the best.

728
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,920
People found out about it.

729
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:46,450
I gave him a shout out to his Instagram
page on one of the UFC broadcasts and

730
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,850
now it's got like, what does he have?
How many followers do you have now?

731
00:45:48,851 --> 00:45:53,200
1.6 million. 1.6 million.
It's that good though.

732
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,590
It's fucking chaos.
He always gets videos deleted and removed,

733
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,450
but apparently they leave him up there.
I mean,

734
00:45:58,451 --> 00:46:01,690
they're not threatened him to take them
down, I don't think. I hope not every,

735
00:46:01,691 --> 00:46:05,940
it's where I go to look at it.
Any fucking dummy that's trying to like,

736
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,370
like light a bomb under a
tire and fly through the air.

737
00:46:09,371 --> 00:46:13,000
It's smashed the roof of a fucking garage
with his face. He's got all that shit.

738
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,570
Motorcycle accidents or people
trying to do wheelies and they fall,

739
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:21,130
it lands on him. Anything fucked up on
the Internet. Tariffs on us. It's funny,

740
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,360
he's got it all. Anything crazy?
Fucking, he's a hilarious guy.

741
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,090
But the fact that he could say
something like that, you know,

742
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,290
like right after this fight,
my calls was hot.

743
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,990
He starts selling tee shirts
afterwards. My balls, Assad tee shirt.

744
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,340
So they don't, uh, I got one.

745
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,970
I don't think real people listened to
anything that's being said about, uh,

746
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,530
Derek,
please,

747
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,980
I need one of those shirts.
A need.

748
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,110
One of those shirts please Derek.
Oh my God. He knew best. He said,

749
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:04,330
you character fight his ass off too.

750
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,270
So do what, what? Uh, I know
what your show, but uh, what,

751
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,600
how many fives do you do now?

752
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,880
And does anybody care about
a fight you don't announce?

753
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:18,780
Yeah, for sure. Care. Yeah. I do a 10
a year, 10 a year, 10 events a year.

754
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:23,430
I'm doing like a big pay per views. Like
there's a lot of them that are overseas,

755
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,070
but they want you to be the
voice, right. Well ahead of time.

756
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,390
I just don't have the time.
I don't have the time with all,

757
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:34,060
with the podcast and with
doing stand up and you know,

758
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,170
making Netflix specials and shit,
that's just don't time. Fuck no,

759
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:41,860
I know there's not like it better
when I do it once a month, like once,

760
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:44,500
like 10 times a year is basically
once a month or I liked,

761
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,040
I liked that better because
it seems like that's um,

762
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,270
and it's the higher profile
stuff. I don't mind the, Oh,

763
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,190
there's a lot of fights that are not that
high profile that I lost their Crosby

764
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:56,200
stills and Nash and you're young,

765
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:01,630
you just pop in and do the big shows.
And that's funny, you know. Yeah.

766
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,250
I care as much. I love doing it, man.
I love doing it. I still do. But um,

767
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:09,960
it's amazing to me how many people that
I meet because I had talked about you

768
00:48:09,961 --> 00:48:11,910
and I'm proud.
I love our friendship,

769
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,560
but I really am hurt you a lot and
I admire you for a lot of reasons.

770
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:20,640
But one of them is that you're famous
for a lot of things and some people don't

771
00:48:20,641 --> 00:48:24,400
know you is all of those things.
I don't know if anybody does well,

772
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,940
probably because they listen to the
podcast and there's millions of them.

773
00:48:26,941 --> 00:48:30,630
But still it's, uh, I
don't think we, I, no,

774
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,310
I don't think it's as common for people
to know how good a comedian you are. Uh,

775
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,070
you know, of course they don't
unless they've seen you, you know,

776
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,080
live because they might think of you
as the guy from the fear factor or the,

777
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,100
uh, or the man show or, or, or UFC.

778
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,480
And you're famous for all of those
things and standup comedy. Uh, that's a,

779
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,600
that's, that's crazy. But I, but I, but I,

780
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,370
I find myself defending you sometimes
going listen to his fucking standup,

781
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:04,790
go watch, turn on Netflix and wants
that last special watch. All of their,

782
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:06,750
it's really,
really good stuff.

783
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:11,610
He's one of the only people that really
makes me laugh. And, uh, and, and,

784
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:15,180
and I feel like I'm out here. It's
spreading the word. You got to podcast.

785
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:19,900
It reaches the entire universe.
And I'm explaining Joe Rogan to people.

786
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,850
So listen,
I love you and I appreciate you.

787
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:24,160
So you saying that to me
means a lot to me. Thank you.

788
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,310
Well that's a anyway,

789
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:32,090
baby shit all over my fucking foot I'm
saying is it was and I'm not over it.

790
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,710
I'm just not over it.

791
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,730
It's a good thing to be angry if you're
going to have one bad moment in your

792
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:41,360
life, that's a fucking,
that's a management cause you
can hose it off your foot.

793
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:45,860
Right? There's no hose. That's what
I'm trying to say. There was no house.

794
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,530
I get it. It wasn't no
fucking hoes. I get it.

795
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:53,300
So why wouldn't have been stuck if there
would have been a hose that was in the

796
00:49:53,301 --> 00:49:54,620
parking lot of a grocery store,

797
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,500
Jamie will be telling me the Conor
McGregor was mad at me for something.

798
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,170
We'll be saying I could pull up the
video. I guess. What was he doing?

799
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,560
Is that a legal, are we allowed to see
him? What did he say? Something like, uh,

800
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,400
I script,
I talk off script,

801
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:11,270
talk on script or call fights on a script
or dad is not really true because no

802
00:50:11,271 --> 00:50:14,570
one ever gives me a script.
That's a fact. I mean,

803
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:17,780
I don't know what exactly he said,
but maybe just didn't like my commentary.

804
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,310
I bet he likes it when he wins.

805
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,690
Right. You know, when you had this
picture in your, uh, right here in the,

806
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,780
what do you call this place

807
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,160
in the studio?
The actual is I'd like him

808
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,490
to call a fight how he sees it correctly
instead of reading off a script though.

809
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,420
Uh, well that's, that's uh, you
know, that's his perception.

810
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:39,590
I understand what he's saying. We got,
sometimes people think that, but you know,

811
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,410
it's very difficult when
someone's calling your fight.

812
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,370
If he's talking about me calling someone's
fight, that's not his friend, then a,

813
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:50,480
that makes much more sense. It's fucking
hard, man. It's hard for me. It's a,

814
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:55,050
I have a really hard time calling friends
fights. It's fucking hard. I don't know.

815
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:59,480
I'm friends with them. Yeah. Why not
know him that well, but I like him a lot.

816
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,330
I respected fun to watch him fight.
That's for sure.

817
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,700
Do you want to play the click?
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Play it.

818
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,720
Great phrasing. Insight. Great

819
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,020
fight.
Heaven sees it correct.

820
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,140
Now the script

821
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,750
guys slept from Mcgregor

822
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,920
the same way as to

823
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,270
maybe I too.
So he's talking about

824
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,040
do must ask him if you do the
podcast. Yeah, I kept his position.

825
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,750
You know that Dee has fight was good
fucking fight, man. It's a hard fight.

826
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,460
I wasn't calling it like the last fight,

827
00:51:50,461 --> 00:51:52,890
but I had to call it with the
knowledge of the last fight.

828
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:56,220
I had to know what happened in
the last fight. The last fight,

829
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,520
Diaz survived the storm,
tagged him,

830
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,530
hadn't Brockton then
finished them on the ground.

831
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:05,520
It doesn't mean that he didn't win the
second fight. It was close fucking fight.

832
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,990
The second fight was a very close fight,

833
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:09,510
but you have to acknowledge that
that other, the fight took place.

834
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,460
So he also said it like with a smile.

835
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,180
I think that guy is,

836
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,600
I mean one of the most dynamic
individuals to ever compete in sport.

837
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:21,690
He's a special person. Very
special person. Very unusual guy.

838
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:25,110
Even if he doesn't beat
Khabib ever again or you know,

839
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:28,560
he loses to this guy loses to
the Floyd Mayweather w who cares?

840
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:33,090
He's still one of a fucking
billion human being.

841
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,600
He's an unusual guy.
The amount of electricity,

842
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,070
it's fucking good man.
He starched Josie Aldo.

843
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,100
It was one of the greatest featherweights,
if not the greatest,

844
00:52:44,101 --> 00:52:47,910
next to Max Holloway of all time.
Starts from with one punch when Aldo was,

845
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:52,200
although, although was the fucking
man, I mean he was the man.

846
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,500
He was smashing everybody for years and
Connor talks so much shit to him and

847
00:52:57,511 --> 00:53:01,530
climb so deep inside his
head and infuriated him to
the point where you're so

848
00:53:01,531 --> 00:53:06,210
emotional and he came charging at Connor
and Connor just slipped back and bank

849
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:11,100
drop like the best one punch
knockout in the history of the sport.

850
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,550
Oh no shit. Oh, 100% because
it was so significant.

851
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,970
There was so much hype behind
it. It was a guy. We were like,

852
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,360
how good is this guy's this guy really
the next big thing or is he going to fall

853
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:24,870
apart when he meets a real champion like
Aldo and then he knocks him out with

854
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,120
fucking punch. It was crazy.
And then hammer fists.

855
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:32,410
And why is that when he's on the
ground, I mean it was definitive, right?

856
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,000
Like 14 and the first set seconds,

857
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,960
the first round he throws a hopping
sidekick. He's gaging the distance.

858
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:44,280
He's got like this karate stance
and then he sees Josie load up here.

859
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:45,114
You can watch it right here.

860
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,560
He sees Josie load up and when
he sees Josie load up, he,

861
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,030
he had this fight one,
can I play it?

862
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:56,040
He had this fight one even before, I
mean he knew how it was going to go down.

863
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,340
He knew what all those going to do.
He was real emotional and angry.

864
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,040
So he knew he going to come forward.
So he's gauging is distance pains.

865
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,370
He that Bam.
Oh,

866
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,240
the Friday one.
I mean,

867
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:13,350
that was like one of the most spectacular
chaos in the history of the sport

868
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,320
because it had so much meaning to it.
It was so important.

869
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,140
It was for the featherweight
championship of the world.

870
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,610
Conard already won the interim title,
Him and Aldo facing each other,

871
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:28,590
this big hype thing. It took her a year
to put together crazy stuff. He's awesome.

872
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,820
Did you call that? Oh yeah. Yeah. I think
he's the only time I've ever yelled out.

873
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:36,270
He slept him when someone got
cracked because it's just,

874
00:54:36,271 --> 00:54:39,090
I don't even know why I said it. And
she's like, that's what came to my head.

875
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:41,430
It just, I just yelled it out. He
said that's cause that's what he did.

876
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:42,730
He slapped him.
I saw that

877
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:47,810
special about that guy who now has for
a world wrestling or a professional

878
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:52,640
wrestling. The guy would, Jake the
snake? Yeah, it would be announcing it.

879
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,530
Oh, I'm sorry. Um, which
guy? Jim Ross. Okay.

880
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,840
Uh, you know, he's got real
bad PTSD and he's got a car,

881
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:06,120
but he's a great rat. A rat. He's
a star. And that sounds like it.

882
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:11,320
It's a book.
A documentary that I saw and I,

883
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:13,290
and I can't remember the
guy's name and the weight,

884
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,770
and in 20 minutes I was still
not well remember the guy's name,

885
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,490
but it was, it was great. He,
and he's really good. I mean,

886
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:25,050
you saw it after for big events. He does
all their big events or that he did,

887
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:30,750
and then he'd like fall off into this
crazy depression thing and then they'd

888
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,010
come back and you know, it was, it was a
great story. I wish I could think of it.

889
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,500
I would think you would know who that was.

890
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:41,480
Mara. Mara Nala. Oh, was
it moral? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

891
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,640
Moral does a showtime boxing too.
What's that?

892
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,210
Is that your phone? Ron Does it.

893
00:55:50,211 --> 00:55:54,110
He folded things back in black.
Yeah.

894
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,000
I think, uh, the specialist
called bipolar rock and roller,

895
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,160
and Mara has been on the podcast for,
he's a buddy. He's a great announcer,

896
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,290
a really, really nice guy too. But yeah,

897
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:12,291
he suffers from mental illness and he
does a really good job of talking about it

898
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:15,540
and making sure that other people know
that this is not something that you

899
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,950
should be ashamed of.
You know,

900
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,040
let's go into this just from my side.
Okay. Love you dad. Aw, how cute.

901
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:24,010
He does that in the middle of nowhere for

902
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,970
no reason at all.

903
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,680
That's awesome man.
Ron White getting some love,

904
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,840
but yeah, more. Um, Mauro
is uh, he is to do pride.

905
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:39,280
Um, he's deprived commentary.
He's done a lot of boxing.

906
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:43,030
He did showtime boxing.
He does WWE.

907
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:47,920
He's done a bunch of MMA shit too. You
know, bunch of different organizations.

908
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,640
I think he even did glory for awhile.
He does Bellah tore too. That's right.

909
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,450
He does. Beltour he's a
really good guy. But yeah,

910
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,590
mental illness is a weird word,
man.

911
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:05,040
Uh, from Washington documentary
a fan, you know, go a,

912
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:06,720
even if you don't know anything about it.

913
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:11,190
I loved wrestling when I was a kid and,
uh,

914
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,470
I was a big Wahoo McDaniels fan

915
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,450
who was Wahoo McDaniels. Oh, come
on. I don't know man. I don't know.

916
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,670
Danielle came up during
the Bob Backlund day.

917
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah, this is gay. He was a Dallas Cowboy
at one time and he was from Midland,

918
00:57:24,001 --> 00:57:28,910
Texas. And he was Cherokee
Indian sides of him.

919
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:32,320
Oh yeah. Look at him. And he
looked like a comedian to write.

920
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:36,330
He was like shaky green or somebody,
right? Like, yeah. Who Does he look like?

921
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,510
He would, he would come out.
Now I, I, this is the first,

922
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:40,830
my first encounter with the peanut,

923
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,950
my first encounter with
the police Buddy Hackett.

924
00:57:43,951 --> 00:57:47,830
That is what his Buddy Hackett that my,

925
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:51,530
my cousin who's a few years
older than me. Well, I'm,

926
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:56,140
I'm visiting my relatives up in this
little town north of Amarillo. Uh,

927
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:57,360
and so we go down,
down,

928
00:57:57,361 --> 00:58:01,260
down and Merrill six 60 miles down to
Amarillo and he's going to take us to the

929
00:58:01,261 --> 00:58:03,390
sport, a tutorial to watch, uh,

930
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,290
the super inferno who I hated.
I mean,

931
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:11,790
this was on local television,
all over the taxes. Then they,

932
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:15,680
and they, one of the stops
was there and, uh, and,

933
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:20,520
and so we win. And I, and I
don't think I'd been to one yet.

934
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,550
And it was my first one and a,

935
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:26,980
and I love Wahoo McDaniels cause
he gets out of there and just be,

936
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:30,090
and he comes back from anything.
Right. You'll think he's out of it.

937
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,710
It ain't out of it.

938
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:36,840
He just say he is amazing and fun
and you know, I just loved him,

939
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:38,880
loved him.
Look and a,

940
00:58:38,881 --> 00:58:42,010
and I hated the super inferno cause
he was like rushing or something,

941
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,190
hit something that they would,

942
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:48,210
there was easy to hey cause we're all
the propaganda we were getting about

943
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:51,300
Russia. It was like their women are ugly.
I'm like, no, they're not. You know,

944
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:55,650
it took me a while. It was like, it
was almost like Phil, uh, Pittsburgh,

945
00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:00,870
because we talk so bad about my relatives
about Pittsburgh because they hated

946
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:05,550
the Steelers. And I just had this
image of Pittsburgh, of this dark,

947
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:11,040
cloudy people been over gray in the face.

948
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:13,470
And first time I drove
into Pittsburgh I was like,

949
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,180
I just place his gorgeous look
at this place. It's a blast.

950
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:22,220
It's a hoot. Great place to
perform. Oh yeah. It's, it's always,

951
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,700
you know, it's always been a big,
uh, a big stop for me. I mean,

952
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:28,340
once I got out of the club,
yeah. Pittsburgh's gray.

953
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,840
Cleveland's another one that's very
underrated. Cleveland's fucking ground.

954
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:32,750
I had a blast playing.

955
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,310
They didn't Improv down in the flats
man titty bar right there in the parking

956
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:39,500
lot. It was like, man,

957
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:42,530
this is one stop shopping for Ron White.

958
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,360
How many dates he do in a
year, these days. Hundred and
Chins. Shit, he's last year.

959
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:51,800
Oof. And then, uh, and then I, you know,

960
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:56,800
and then I tried to do sets when
I'm in town and, and uh, the, uh,

961
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,990
and I should do more, you know, I kind
of Nice. Is it to have a store though?

962
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:05,810
You know, it's great. Uh, I went
to the memorial and, uh, Brody's.

963
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,670
Yeah. And uh, you know,

964
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:11,270
I'd like to just tell your listeners
that you never know when it's going to be

965
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:14,900
the last time you see somebody.
So don't ever,

966
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:18,710
ever hesitate to say I'm
going to need that money.

967
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:24,200
Right.
You can't do it later.

968
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:27,950
You can't get it from their mother.
You know, you can't do that.

969
01:00:27,951 --> 01:00:32,540
So very good point. So don't forget that
every time I saw a Brodeo game, a hug,

970
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,770
that's one thing. The protean I
always had and always, always.

971
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,880
Every single time I saw Brodie,
God gave him a big hug.

972
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:45,770
Like he was a big hugger. Yeah. You know,
I, I only knew him as a brother. You know,

973
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,840
I, you know, I, I feel important.

974
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,580
I feel like it's important to me to be a
part of the comedy community, you know,

975
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:53,990
participate in it.

976
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:59,240
If you're out there and you're a
comedian and you want to be a comedian,

977
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,560
you can be a comedian,

978
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:05,260
but you got to go be a comedian and you
got to do it every day. You know, every,

979
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:08,390
you know, for the, for the most part,
and I know you're the same way. I mean,

980
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:12,800
I know the, that you'd never pass up an
opportunity to get behind the microphone,

981
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:16,610
whether it's eight or 10 million
people to listen to this are,

982
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:20,180
there are 65 people in a whatever. It
doesn't matter. Doesn't matter to me.

983
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:24,560
You got to do it all, all the
time. To do it right all the time.

984
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:29,270
You lose the touch with the reality of it.
And also it's pace,

985
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:34,160
rhythm could be in and how
comfortable you are in any situation.

986
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:38,210
You know, this situation, it's just
me and you talking or 26 people.

987
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:41,420
I play the laughing skull and
Atlanta to 65 people sold out.

988
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:44,260
It's one of the hottest rooms I've ever
had. My hands. I love that joint. Oh,

989
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:47,570
in that cool place. Yeah, I did that
place a couple of years ago. Yeah.

990
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:51,200
That was my hand when I lived out there.
And what a great place to practice. Oh,

991
01:01:51,201 --> 01:01:53,330
it was, it was great.
It's a great staff too.

992
01:01:53,331 --> 01:01:56,730
It's like a there look comedy fans,
people.

993
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,860
The vortex was a really cool
bar. Next Great Burgers, right?

994
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:05,960
They sell a lot of number one tequila.
Nice. Yeah. That's a great little spot.

995
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,630
If you could have, that's
what every city needs, right?

996
01:02:08,631 --> 01:02:11,630
They need a great little comedy community.
You know,

997
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:14,540
where you got up in commerce
that are really working on it.

998
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:19,470
People that really appreciate it.
Well, there was a really good, uh, uh,

999
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,880
comedy scene in Atlanta and
I like a couple of guys that
won last comic standing,

1000
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:28,310
uh, came out of Atlanta. And that's
great. I'm so bad with names. Like, yeah,

1001
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:32,340
it's only like if you stopped and think
how many real comedy communities are

1002
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:36,120
there in the country. I don't even
think there's 10. You think there's 10?

1003
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:37,823
Well,
you know,

1004
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:43,190
Saint Louis has always had
one in Chicago's always had
Denver's always had one.

1005
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,740
And of course, La, New York, Houston, uh,

1006
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:54,150
kicks in Greenley and pineapple,
pineapple.

1007
01:02:54,151 --> 01:02:55,770
Once,
he didn't want to use to do,

1008
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:00,060
he would drive all the way
across Houston to ignore me.

1009
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:03,760
That's what he did it,
he did it all the time too.

1010
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,860
And he had no reason to be there.
And I,

1011
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:10,960
and I know that some of those guys
didn't like me because I don't,

1012
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:14,460
I don't know why. I don't know why,
but they were really, really clickish.

1013
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:17,910
And I went in there and one night
and had a horrible set and a,

1014
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:21,490
and I was following Hicks
or, and uh, you know,

1015
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:25,860
and I had really green show, but in
the right circumstance, you know,

1016
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:30,090
in a comedy club with nothing
great happening before you,

1017
01:03:30,091 --> 01:03:34,620
it kind of worked a little bit
that night and didn't work at all.

1018
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,660
And uh, Eh, eh, but,

1019
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:40,680
and I was probably getting a little more
work than those guys were, some of them.

1020
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,010
And they were like, oh, he sucks. Well,

1021
01:03:44,011 --> 01:03:48,300
the fact of the matter is I did suck
because of my act went up. You know,

1022
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:52,020
you don't want to follow it.
I say that to make the story better.

1023
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,370
I wasn't following Hicks,
but he was, you know,

1024
01:03:56,130 --> 01:04:00,470
or Kennison, but they were both
there. Oh, okay. No, I had done set,

1025
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,210
but everybody was good. I mean, the
green to be good. All these guys,

1026
01:04:03,211 --> 01:04:07,020
we're seasoned pros. So that
was a hotline up and, uh,

1027
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,080
but, but I never felt, you know, like the,
any of them liked me except for Higgs.

1028
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,500
And I came to see him, you
know, do, do shows and, uh, uh,

1029
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,880
I asked him to do the story about,
uh,

1030
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:25,740
just the John Davidson and
the mask and the, and he goes,

1031
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:30,180
here's what he says. He goes, don't
stand next to the exit. It's just a tip.

1032
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,670
Cause people just walk out of
the show. When he had watched
him do that, he, he, uh,

1033
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:40,820
he did that at the Nick's comedy stop in
Boston and he cleared the fucking room

1034
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:42,510
man.
And it was,

1035
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:47,460
it was crazy because at the end of the
show there was me and Greg Fitzsimmons

1036
01:04:47,461 --> 01:04:51,090
and maybe three or four of the comics
of five or six people in the crowd.

1037
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:55,540
There was like maybe 20 people left, all
told, laughing our fucking asses. Right.

1038
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:59,400
Everybody else is getting up angry.
I saw it go both ways. You know,

1039
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:03,100
I've seen him beat crowds to death.
I saw,

1040
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:08,120
I sat one night at the last stop and
Austin and nobody in the room could

1041
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:13,620
breathe. And he was in the mood to do
it. And, uh, you know, and you know,

1042
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:18,550
and, and I think sometimes he wasn't,
sometimes he, yeah. Or whatever,

1043
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:24,030
but he was in the mood and decided to
just fucking stab us all in the face and

1044
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:29,110
the, and it was, and it
was just, it was beautiful.

1045
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,250
He was exceptional.
Now,

1046
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,350
whether or not people think he
was one of the greats like that,

1047
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:38,330
that's entirely subjection,
right? It's subjective.

1048
01:05:38,331 --> 01:05:42,140
Rather you'd say it's completely up
to your own interpretation. But to me,

1049
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:46,670
he changed comedy and a lot of ways
because he made people talk about things

1050
01:05:46,671 --> 01:05:49,640
that were important because everybody
else was talking about nonsense.

1051
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:53,420
You're talking about airline food and
how come I can't lean my seat back?

1052
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,960
Standard normal shit. I'm
following that up. Exactly right.

1053
01:05:56,961 --> 01:06:01,490
And he was coming along talking about
a positive drug stories. You know,

1054
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:04,390
a man on acid realize it all matters.

1055
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:09,080
Energy condensed to a slow
rhythmic vibration. Like
that whole fucking bit was,

1056
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,590
it was Tom with the weather app.
That feels amazing.

1057
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:15,250
Yeah, no, no, it was anyways,
influential. I mean the, I know it,

1058
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:20,480
I think I can say this about Bill Hicks
and I am an expert at standup comedy.

1059
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,590
I would have a triple doctorate in,
uh,

1060
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:29,420
if you gave those kinds of
things for the work. I've,

1061
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:33,090
the amount of time I've
put into it and uh, and it,

1062
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,530
and you as a peer would
have the exact same thing.

1063
01:06:36,531 --> 01:06:40,670
So for me to listen to someone's
opinion about standup comedy,

1064
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:45,410
they have to have a lot of credit to me
before I really give a shit what they

1065
01:06:45,411 --> 01:06:48,710
think. Okay. So here's
what you should think.

1066
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:55,570
The only thing that every comic from my
generation agrees on is he was better

1067
01:06:57,861 --> 01:07:02,670
than us. And that's the only thing
that they agree on. And, and,

1068
01:07:02,671 --> 01:07:03,180
and they,

1069
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:08,090
and I can't find anybody that has
a big argument that he wasn't,

1070
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:10,610
and that was the best that ever lived.
No.

1071
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:13,100
But did he influenced me
more than anybody else.

1072
01:07:13,101 --> 01:07:17,030
And you probably more than anybody else
because you're certainly that way also,

1073
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:20,780
you know. Right. Some of them, somebody
built that bridge. Yes. And you,

1074
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:24,290
and now you feel free to talk
about anything. You know,

1075
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:28,730
none of yours act as ever hack. You
know, there were a lot of hacks,

1076
01:07:28,731 --> 01:07:31,880
but I think it's freed people
not to be a hack, you know?

1077
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,280
Yeah. He uh, he cared people that
he made it shameful, you know,

1078
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,510
are talking about hat. But there was also
you're cured above stealing material.

1079
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,870
So I don't know if I did I, well,
I think it's still going on.

1080
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,050
I guarantee you it's [inaudible]
there's a chain reaction to it.

1081
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:48,430
Just like craft getting caught,

1082
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:53,350
getting a blowjob that shut down business
all know you've gotten to know United

1083
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:53,380
States.

1084
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:58,380
Nobody walked into a spa without wondering
whether or not existing of Arabian

1085
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,110
and your name was going
to be blown out on them.

1086
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,020
Isn't that crazy?
But here's the thing they miss.

1087
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,170
They get this guys that there's a
video of this guy doing a massage.

1088
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:11,320
So they've got video of it, right? And
at the end, the girl jerks them off.

1089
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,710
What if she didn't jerk them off?
What if she just gave him a massage?

1090
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:16,130
What kind of a fucked

1091
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,630
up invasion of his privacy have you
just went in there to get a massage?

1092
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:24,730
Right? Or was everybody just
getting jacked off? I would imagine,

1093
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:26,840
but he sent him a plea
deal to drop the charges.

1094
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:30,040
So I don't know what happened really.
He ratted everybody out.

1095
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:35,430
I need to stay at, yeah, he's
not going to brown kids. Well, it

1096
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:40,140
Jackie, you know, I was a so lonesome, you
know, I took some comfort there. You know,

1097
01:08:40,141 --> 01:08:43,630
in my lifetime has a Paul
Simon once wrote and,

1098
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:47,930
and um, okay. I'm not, I'm, you know what,

1099
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:51,050
I'm not going to say it because it's
just not worth it. You're worth it.

1100
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,433
It's not it.

1101
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:56,780
But everybody seems to be perfectly aware
that they could be washing your feet.

1102
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,380
Yeah.

1103
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,530
Yeah. And you know, and that's fine. Yeah.

1104
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,820
Why is it that a guy like that
would go to a place like that?

1105
01:09:05,821 --> 01:09:09,520
Like he's so rich, I, you know what?
He has a guy, if you don't have a guy,

1106
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:13,860
should get a guy no further,
a cleaner look,

1107
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:17,990
look no further than a in the,
and this is ever,

1108
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,950
everybody's going to realize that you
reached out fading. My memory is now, but,

1109
01:09:20,951 --> 01:09:25,560
uh, uh, uh, the English actor
that got caught with the, uh,

1110
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,590
yes. Elizabeth Hurley's husband
Hugh Grant, right? Yeah.

1111
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:35,060
Look at Hugh Grant. Married to the hottest
woman on the planet at the time. Right.

1112
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:36,390
Ruthlessly hot.

1113
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:40,450
Raw. Yeah. Amazingly hot. He wasn't
married to her either. Right.

1114
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:44,500
They're boyfriend, girlfriend. And uh,

1115
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:50,230
and even I couldn't understand that.
Right. I mean, cause I, I, you know, I've,

1116
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:54,190
I've been with a couple of hot chicks
before in my life, but this was,

1117
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:58,810
he wanted a freaky. Yeah. He
and I, you know, ag, I get that.

1118
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:03,640
And it comes back to that appetite
thing that guys have. You know,

1119
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:09,270
I've gotten a hand job from somebody
and I admit this and it was the best sex

1120
01:10:09,551 --> 01:10:12,850
I've ever had in my life because it
was somebody that was a number one,

1121
01:10:12,851 --> 01:10:17,650
it was a great massage. And then
this tantric thing going on and uh,

1122
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,840
and, and, you know, and, and it,

1123
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:23,650
but it was fantastic and,

1124
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:27,970
and pricey and, uh, and,
and it's free most anywhere.

1125
01:10:27,971 --> 01:10:30,820
And that's in Vegas is legal as it can be.
You know,

1126
01:10:30,821 --> 01:10:35,260
they have milking tables and have a
whole, your Dick Hangs through and, uh,

1127
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:40,120
they do table. Look it up, look
it up. They got it for the guy.

1128
01:10:40,121 --> 01:10:43,280
If he lives in his stomach. Well, you
don't have, you got somebody to crack.

1129
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:46,000
You got somewhere to put the hard on.

1130
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:49,980
He's laid on your back. No,
but it makes more sense.

1131
01:10:49,981 --> 01:10:52,650
Hygienically to have like a
hole in the bottom of the table.

1132
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:53,813
Okay.

1133
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:59,070
It'll be on the screen, I'm sure
soon that is. Listen, listen,

1134
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:00,480
I,

1135
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:05,390
all I'm saying is that in like in Canada,
they,

1136
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:09,670
you know, are the, most of
the rest of the world. It's,

1137
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,740
uh,

1138
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,800
getting a tug is really not a
crime of any kind whatsoever,

1139
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:19,770
and is harmless. And who
gives a shit and, well,

1140
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:23,950
why is it okay to massage your feet?
But it's not okay to my, I know what,

1141
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,480
I would rather massage my dick
then my own feet. I would,

1142
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:31,590
and I prove it on a regular basis,
regular basis.

1143
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:36,120
I think the problem really is sex
trafficking. That's the problem.

1144
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,700
And that horrible error.

1145
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:44,250
That's the worst thing. Exactly.
I can imagine, but, but it,

1146
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,430
but again,
I'm not gonna,

1147
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:51,190
I'm not gonna go there because it's the
most horrific thing you could imagine.

1148
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,680
The most horrific thing
you can imagine taking.

1149
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:58,730
Just finish watching that series
about taking Madeline, uh, and,

1150
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,170
um, and so I'm like, I
just can't even that, that,

1151
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:08,010
that I would, you know, I would support
any, anything, any way, shape or form,

1152
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,090
uh, to have it stomped out,
spend billions of dollars,

1153
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,720
put boots on the ground,
will stop it if you can,

1154
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:20,220
in any way you can. Women who are
trying to be legitimate sex workers,

1155
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:22,950
whether or not you think that's
the thing, they, you know,

1156
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:26,110
it doesn't matter what I think, it
isn't, it isn't, you know, go down to go.

1157
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,550
I just went to Amsterdam before I took
my mother to Barcelona because I wanted a

1158
01:12:29,551 --> 01:12:31,390
little three day stopover,
uh,

1159
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:35,970
before I spent eight days a
mom and Barcelona and, uh,

1160
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:41,370
and their signs don't take pictures
of our sex workers, our sex workers,

1161
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:46,680
not sex with our sex work. And, uh, mean
they, they, they totally own it and go,

1162
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:51,600
hey, this is not a bad deal.
You know, uh, you know,

1163
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:53,850
your,
you know what you're qualified to do,

1164
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,960
make French fries or it turns
out you're super hot and,

1165
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:04,940
and you in our country, you can have
this job or in la or in this country,

1166
01:13:04,941 --> 01:13:06,920
you can have that job,
just not everywhere,

1167
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:11,090
but it was only a couple of spots in
this country. Right. But in Nevada,

1168
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:15,020
in Nevada for, I think that, I didn't
even know. I think it just Nevada.

1169
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:19,520
I think that's it, but it's, to
me, here's what's really important.

1170
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,563
Okay.

1171
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:24,960
I play Vegas a lot,
right?

1172
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:29,840
I'm 10 weekends a year at
the Mirage and marijuana is,

1173
01:13:29,841 --> 01:13:33,740
uh,
is legal recreationally now.

1174
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,420
And they have the biggest dispensary
in the world was just like a, like,

1175
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:41,150
it's like a universal made it or
something. You know, I went in there,

1176
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:45,410
it was fantastic.
And a prostitution is legal.

1177
01:13:45,411 --> 01:13:49,010
You can get a little drink of liquor
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1178
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:51,980
And I realized that I'm
a law abiding citizen.

1179
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:57,440
I hear when I'm standing on this
part of the United States ground,

1180
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:00,560
I don't break any laws at all.
I can be free.

1181
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,350
That's why I feel so good when I
go to Vegas. That's why people go,

1182
01:14:03,351 --> 01:14:06,470
do you like Vegas? Do you get tired
of it? And I'm no, no. You know why?

1183
01:14:06,471 --> 01:14:10,340
Cause I can breathe deep motherfucker.
That's why I could be who I am.

1184
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,000
I can it openly.
Yeah,

1185
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,900
I can, uh, you know it and, and,

1186
01:14:13,901 --> 01:14:18,790
and so can everybody else
saying that? And that's why, uh,

1187
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:24,280
Oh yeah, I've, I've sold
out 250 shows and same with

1188
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,850
the, you know, the, uh, you,

1189
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:33,520
you realize it's the law
that causes the paranoia.

1190
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:34,780
You know,

1191
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:38,080
because when you're in Amsterdam and one
of those coffee shops smoking a joint

1192
01:14:38,081 --> 01:14:39,730
and drinking a bad ass cup of coffee,

1193
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,380
it's fun and free,
you know,

1194
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:48,510
freeing and it's the way it
should be. You know, the, the,

1195
01:14:48,511 --> 01:14:49,870
the fact of the matter is,

1196
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:55,030
the same thing happens to me at Florida
with just a little bit. I'm handcuffed,

1197
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,230
taken to jail and,

1198
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:01,840
and moved from city jail,

1199
01:15:01,841 --> 01:15:06,250
the county jail and processed and
fingerprinted and photographed.

1200
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:10,810
They printed my address
on the Internet so people,

1201
01:15:10,811 --> 01:15:13,960
anybody in the world could just
walk straight over to the house.

1202
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:18,370
I don't think anybody did because
nobody gives a shit except for people.

1203
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:22,060
A few people did. Right?
Ron White has a jet

1204
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:23,463
[inaudible]

1205
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:28,620
that's the part I don't believe.
But anyway,

1206
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:33,640
yeah man, it's laws. The real problem
when you make alcohol illegal, you,

1207
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:37,240
you made organized crime big.
That's what happened.

1208
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:39,220
That's what they did learn
that from prohibition.

1209
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:41,680
They should be learning that from all,

1210
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,450
all the drug problems
we have in this country.

1211
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:44,330
Alana,

1212
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:48,440
we'll be selling for the price of corn
in 20 years because it takes the same

1213
01:15:48,441 --> 01:15:50,120
amount of effort to grow it, right? Yeah.

1214
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:53,850
No, it's easier. This is probably easier.
You probably need less pesticides. Right?

1215
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,110
You know, there's, um,

1216
01:15:55,200 --> 01:16:00,200
there's a gigantic problem south of our
border folks with drugs and it's because

1217
01:16:00,631 --> 01:16:04,800
of us. It's 100% because of us. We've,
I mean, not us, like you and me,

1218
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:08,130
I don't do any drugs.
They sell the pot that I get,

1219
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:09,870
I get from people that
grow it in California,

1220
01:16:09,871 --> 01:16:13,080
but there's a lot of people that buy
coke and if you buy coke or Meth,

1221
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:16,020
you probably buying it from
someone down there. And you know,

1222
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:19,740
there's a God damn thriving industry that
would go away if we made things legal.

1223
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,570
If you gave people like you Ron,

1224
01:16:21,571 --> 01:16:25,440
why you're telling me you
shouldn't be able to go buy coke?

1225
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:29,430
Who the fuck they to tell you?
You can't buy coke? First of all,

1226
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:32,230
you sell Tequila.
Kill yourself.

1227
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:36,920
Yeah. Feel the way more fucked
up on my Dick Ila. Yeah. Or No.

1228
01:16:36,921 --> 01:16:41,780
Quick as fucked up as far as fucked up
as heroin as fucked up is anything else.

1229
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,590
I know. Probably easier
to close it off. You know,

1230
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:49,520
I all on my own amazingly great Tequila.
Uh,

1231
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:55,330
I have found myself puke and because I'm
an idiot and got just too carried away,

1232
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:59,110
you know, it's probably easy
to kill yourself with, to
kill them. It is. With coke,

1233
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,250
you probably have to do a
lot of coke to die. Right.

1234
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:02,320
It's probably hard to do that.

1235
01:17:02,321 --> 01:17:04,850
Coke at the end when you're
fucking nose is bleeding.

1236
01:17:04,851 --> 01:17:07,690
Your heart's pounding out of your chest
to go take another bump to push yourself

1237
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:10,070
over the edge.
It's probably hard and a scar face.

1238
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,900
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Right. He lived
cocaine. They shot him up 55 times.

1239
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:19,310
Yeah, they didn't. No. Joey
Diaz is alive and well.

1240
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:23,300
He tried ideas is alive and well.
Right?

1241
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:26,480
You got to do a lot of coke to kill
you, especially. Well, Joey Diaz,

1242
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:30,620
that motherfucker can eat.
He can eat rat poison and go do a show.

1243
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,150
He'd be mocket death.
Fuck you. Cock sucker.

1244
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:38,010
I went to see him in Austin.

1245
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:43,030
He was playing at us that we had
watched him just blister a crowd.

1246
01:17:43,271 --> 01:17:47,770
I mean, you just go listed him. He's my
go. It was a, it was so much fun to watch.

1247
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:51,760
He was a,
that seemed do short sets all the time,

1248
01:17:51,761 --> 01:17:54,820
but I got to watch him do you know you
have 50 I think if he did probably around

1249
01:17:54,821 --> 01:17:58,300
50 minutes or something like that.
And it was great. We had a blast.

1250
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:03,400
Try replicating that and this
fucking sanitized world. Right?

1251
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:05,620
There's pure al everywhere you turned.

1252
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:10,680
The thing is if you're a true and they
are something that I believe that if it

1253
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,320
is a comic or whatever,
if you're true to your nature,

1254
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:20,620
then enough people will be attracted
to that and that you don't,

1255
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:25,150
the only mistake you can make is to
not be true to your nature. Right.

1256
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:30,151
And if you look at all the great
or really successful comics and a,

1257
01:18:31,061 --> 01:18:35,020
in the history of comedy, they,
they were true to who they were.

1258
01:18:35,021 --> 01:18:37,510
I mean Cosby but,

1259
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:42,430
but you know,
he tricked everybody.

1260
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:47,670
Yeah. He pulled one over on us.
Can you imagine if he was honest?

1261
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:53,300
What I like to do a drug
where man and fuck them.

1262
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:59,980
I really did that bit of state. I never
really did that bit on stage very much.

1263
01:18:59,981 --> 01:19:04,400
Can I do it on your shoulder?
Oh fuck yeah, they uh, let
me think about it cause I

1264
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:12,820
got bill Cosby and Bill
Co is bills defense, uh,

1265
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:18,940
explained to us years ago how much he
hates cursing and no one curses more than

1266
01:19:18,941 --> 01:19:23,290
a wide awake woman who's being raped.
So

1267
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,920
it's terrible.
It just Joe.

1268
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:33,160
But it made me cry laughing cause
it's so fucked up. I mean you look,

1269
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:38,140
it's both true and fucked
up, right? Oh yeah, it is.

1270
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:42,040
Yeah. It's not an endorsing rape.
That's why it never really found a spot.

1271
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:45,370
The opening line up.
That's an hour and 20 minutes long.

1272
01:19:45,371 --> 01:19:49,750
So open with that mother fucker,
sir. I know I do. I, you know what,

1273
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:53,740
it was always just a mixed review. It
made people think it may. Yes. You know,

1274
01:19:53,741 --> 01:19:56,380
it was like baby duck pussy lip tacos.
You know,

1275
01:19:56,381 --> 01:20:00,330
you either liked it or you didn't like
it, but you listen to the next bit. Wow.

1276
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:04,690
You made sense though? It does make
sense. I mean, it really does show,

1277
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:07,980
it's just a funny thing to say.
Well, I think we should all

1278
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,810
should have known like with his
trying to control other people.

1279
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,250
He was always trying to control young
black comics and stop them from swearing.

1280
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:21,360
Right.
Eddie Murphy to prior or was it yeah.

1281
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,370
And people any called prior.
Yeah.

1282
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:29,490
Shut the fuck up. Did you get paid? Eh,

1283
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:34,180
tell bill to have a coke and a smile
and shut the fuck up. Yeah, that's it.

1284
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,530
That was, there's a guy that I'd like to
get back into comedy. Eddie Murphy, Eddie,

1285
01:20:40,531 --> 01:20:44,610
if you're out there,
kept packing the comedy so hard at a raw,

1286
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:47,880
you know Ross Oh, good. Delirious.

1287
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:51,540
Delirious of the best comedy
specials of all time. Of all time.

1288
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:56,580
And he did his thing, but he said
also himself. Yes. Bill Cosby himself.

1289
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,430
He himself was very good that,
you know, a lot of comics.

1290
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:04,140
Learned a lot about standup comedy
watching bill Cosby himself. Oh yeah.

1291
01:21:04,141 --> 01:21:08,370
He knew how to hold a moment. Oh yeah. Oh,
it was a beautiful, we works. So you know,

1292
01:21:08,371 --> 01:21:10,080
that thing was framed like this.

1293
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:15,440
The whole show was just his face and no
cutaway to fucking people laughing in

1294
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:21,210
the audience are cheesy shots from up
here where you can't see who it is.

1295
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:26,400
It was just framed in red, right?
Just on his face and, and, and it was,

1296
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:31,230
it was gorgeous work. Just gorgeous
work. I've thought about this many times.

1297
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,830
Do you think that those
people from back in that era,

1298
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:38,970
from back in like the sixties and the
50s that they used to drug each other and

1299
01:21:38,971 --> 01:21:42,570
they didn't think it was as big a
deal like that men would do that,

1300
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,140
which would we would consider
today to be horrific. You know,

1301
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:50,730
the idea that you would take someone's
daughter and drug her and it's horrific.

1302
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:55,640
Oh yeah, we want violent repercussions.
Yeah, that's fine, that violent,

1303
01:21:55,680 --> 01:22:00,330
I want to smash. But do you think that
maybe back then they were ignorant,

1304
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:01,740
they didn't know any better.

1305
01:22:01,741 --> 01:22:05,130
Like you always hear about people slipping
people in Mickey did they think it

1306
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:09,330
was cute where they actually do it? Like
how many men were doing that back then?

1307
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,171
Do you know what?

1308
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:15,171
I'm [inaudible] I find myself to
be a so conservatively that I,

1309
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:21,030
I really can't think outside in that box.
Get all,

1310
01:22:21,031 --> 01:22:23,610
I just watched that documentary
about him taking that girl.

1311
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:25,920
They don't know what happened to her.
Took her when she was three years old,

1312
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:26,340
but they were,

1313
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:29,820
but it talked a lot about recovery and
all that and just how sick of fucking

1314
01:22:29,821 --> 01:22:34,010
world is out there. And I can't
even think about it. I mean, I,

1315
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:37,950
this one detective had to look through
these dark websites and I'm like,

1316
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:42,120
and look at these images and you can't,
and look at those images. You know,

1317
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:45,090
it's just a sickening thing. No, Ron,
they're having a hard time with that,

1318
01:22:45,091 --> 01:22:49,080
with the people that work for social
media sites when they have to take down

1319
01:22:49,081 --> 01:22:52,050
videos like on Facebook and things
like that. I like a lot of them,

1320
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,050
like they're taking down these
horrific videos, like horrible,

1321
01:22:55,051 --> 01:22:56,370
all shit all day long.

1322
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:00,450
These people were just finding the
things that are like horrible accident.

1323
01:23:00,451 --> 01:23:04,770
It's horrible. Assassinations, isis
videos and they're just taking them down.

1324
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,440
Right. You know, I was on
Jim Norton show one time.

1325
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:11,130
He showed me a video of a gaff
fucking a snake. And I'm like, dude,

1326
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,090
I don't want to see any of this
shit was in the fucking gym.

1327
01:23:15,091 --> 01:23:19,660
Know when Jim Jam and that. And
he's very, very funny and I love to,

1328
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,600
whatever I do with Jim is fun.

1329
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:26,790
But he looks at anything on the people
covering the heads off and all that stuff.

1330
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:30,260
But he just said, well look at
it. And I'm like, the guys that

1331
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:34,460
snake pussy,
he found a snake plus he and stuck.

1332
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:37,970
Well, you ever see a snake egg,
you know, regular size cock.

1333
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:42,350
So you know it's a fucking
hole. Yeah, it's fine to hold.

1334
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,690
The dude's haven't fucked. I'll
find you whole. It can't be fucked.

1335
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,750
Five the fetish. I love Jim Norton
for the same reason why I love you.

1336
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:55,350
He's just himself like he's not
pretending to be anybody. He's an himself.

1337
01:23:56,030 --> 01:24:00,170
They won't watch your man fucking
snake. He's, he watched men fuck men.

1338
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:04,100
He loves everything he likes.
He likes transgender women.

1339
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,380
He gets off on it, it gets it. He gets,

1340
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,310
and he's open about it talks about all
the time to the point where when he was

1341
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,500
on Opie and Anthony and the
one they were in their prime,

1342
01:24:12,501 --> 01:24:15,440
it was like one of the major
themes was that a Norton,

1343
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:20,000
is it into a transgender women?
What's that called?

1344
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:23,270
I don't know. It's called being Jim
Norton. Right. He's happy. I mean,

1345
01:24:23,271 --> 01:24:25,820
there's gotta be a name, right?
There's probably some names.

1346
01:24:25,821 --> 01:24:28,730
So this is probably like
a slang term for it.

1347
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,150
Then there's probably some
sort of, uh, you know,

1348
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:37,010
I was actually thinking of anybody knew
what that was. It would be you. Yeah.

1349
01:24:37,011 --> 01:24:38,270
I've never heard Jamie.

1350
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:41,780
You think there's a word for dudes
are only in two transgender women?

1351
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:45,290
I bet there is. If there isn't, we could
probably make, now you're talking about,

1352
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:46,143
sure.
There's got to be,

1353
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:49,850
oh,
a man is now a woman.

1354
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,710
Right, right, right. Not a
woman that's now a man. Well,
this should be two. Right?

1355
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:57,430
There's piggers, which is a man who's
now one of them is still has a Dick,

1356
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:00,070
and she can peg you. Yeah. Right?

1357
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,890
She's your girlfriend and
she can fuck your ass. I had,

1358
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,510
I had sex with a woman that was a,

1359
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:15,130
she played for the WWE Mba. Well, she said

1360
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:20,010
three, but I know she was a full head
taller than me and she was so tall.

1361
01:25:20,011 --> 01:25:22,530
She could stick a finger in my ass.
She,

1362
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:27,550
her arms are so long that she could
reach around while I was whoa and stick a

1363
01:25:28,441 --> 01:25:31,650
finger in my ass. And I'm like, let's
just go to the church, you know,

1364
01:25:31,651 --> 01:25:32,690
and get married.
Silver

1365
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:37,470
with some gladiator children.
Big Funny Dude. Come on,

1366
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:42,720
search here. I haven't found that term,
but I've even heard a lesbian man,

1367
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:47,040
a lesbian man. What does that mean? Okay,

1368
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:51,030
I'll take a stab at it and
say help me. It's uh, it's,

1369
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,990
it's a,
it's a,

1370
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:58,890
it's a man who turned themselves into
a woman, but he still likes women.

1371
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:02,600
Yeah. But he can keep his penis, I think.
I think that's what's going on. Yeah.

1372
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:03,980
He goes by,

1373
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:08,300
he just likes to be pegged by women.
Oh, not in, he's not in the guys.

1374
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:14,420
I've never heard that term. I just,
I'm looking for a lesbian man,

1375
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:18,320
so he only likes gay,
bisexual.

1376
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,880
That just opens the field up all the way
that shuts it down. That you're right.

1377
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,860
And who's going to, that's like a
Iq, that pond to fish from question.

1378
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:29,210
Not very big.
Not that big

1379
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:33,730
a lesbian man. Imagine if like that's
all you'll put the bat signal out.

1380
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:36,220
I'm a lesbian man.
I'm just looking for Gals to peg me.

1381
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:39,610
I bet there's a lot of them that would
want to fuck you just for revenge.

1382
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:43,420
How much of that is a women that,

1383
01:26:43,421 --> 01:26:45,940
why is it that the pretty women don't
seem to have any problem with men?

1384
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,630
Like a lot of them were like
pretty easy going about men,

1385
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,690
but if you have bad genetics,

1386
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:55,270
like if you got dealt a
wrong end of the stick,

1387
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:58,870
that's that is if there's like people
talk about income inequality in this

1388
01:26:58,871 --> 01:27:01,630
country and that's definitely a real
thing. But if there's a real thing,

1389
01:27:01,631 --> 01:27:04,990
it's like who do people want to
fuck inequality in this country?

1390
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:07,720
And that's off the Goddamn charts,
right?

1391
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:12,460
I mean there's just as men and as women,
we just have to,

1392
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:14,440
we have to understand that some people,

1393
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:19,860
they have a unearned
tyranny on sexual affection.

1394
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:21,220
It's unearned.

1395
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:24,550
They didn't have to do anything like
these Russian women at that people are

1396
01:27:24,551 --> 01:27:28,300
lying to you about, right? Yeah.
You meet them and you go, Jesus,

1397
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:33,510
it's just rushing gladiator genetics
and perfect like model form and you're

1398
01:27:34,991 --> 01:27:37,690
like, Holy Shit, let me get the
fuck out of this room quick.

1399
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:42,510
I was on a cruise one time
that was married and um,

1400
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:48,540
and I had rented the, like the back
quarter I've ever in the same spot.

1401
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:53,541
Oprah stays in and it
cost a fortune and I'm at,

1402
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:57,600
we're out on the deck and there's two
big suites in the middle and another one

1403
01:27:57,601 --> 01:27:59,970
just like mine at the end.
But the one that was in this one,

1404
01:27:59,971 --> 01:28:04,590
which was also a real expensive room, was
this Russian dude. And he was short guy,

1405
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,790
chunky and bald.

1406
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,840
But the girl who was with him was
just a 12 and I knew his second.

1407
01:28:13,051 --> 01:28:13,561
I saw her.

1408
01:28:13,561 --> 01:28:18,180
I was fucked because there's no way
my wife was not going to catch me.

1409
01:28:18,181 --> 01:28:19,320
Just at least take it away.

1410
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:24,190
One little glimpse
and then she was going out.

1411
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:28,490
Yeah, that's what you want. You'd rather
fuck her and then me. And I'm like, no.

1412
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:35,030
Absolutely not. Absolutely
not. Why would I? Why would I?

1413
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,670
That's outrageous.
What did outrageous assertion?

1414
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,270
What an accusation.
Yeah.

1415
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,230
If they only knew how vulnerable
we are to a woman like that,

1416
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,630
it's like that woman can,

1417
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:54,160
there's a lot of people that that
woman can like run their life and they,

1418
01:28:54,161 --> 01:28:59,161
they'll meet a guy who's an accountant
who's never fucked a 12 and they'll start

1419
01:28:59,471 --> 01:29:02,170
talking to him and basically end up

1420
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:07,200
doing the thing they want to do as long
as they're willing to actually touch him.

1421
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:11,400
Right. As long as you're willing to
stick their fucking beautiful guys mouth,

1422
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:15,670
he's helpless to suck on his lips
with Brian, that pussy against deck,

1423
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:17,040
he's grab his ass.

1424
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:21,240
She put your finger on the
base of his taint and rub it.

1425
01:29:21,241 --> 01:29:24,270
Why you stick your tongue down his throat.
His Dick is hard as a rock.

1426
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:27,140
Well, these things have
never happened to this man.

1427
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:32,030
There goes the neighborhood time
was back the car up to the house.

1428
01:29:32,031 --> 01:29:36,730
Throw the keys in the fucking yard. Tell
the kids, yeah, that's an ice tea. Sorry.

1429
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:40,320
I'll do it. Turned out this way. A hood,

1430
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:46,190
ice tea and body count.
Fuck yeah.

1431
01:29:46,191 --> 01:29:49,450
There's certain women that
they could just run you. Oh,

1432
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,130
well I know. I know. I know. I get it.

1433
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:59,720
I get it. I'm married. One of them
got to be careful. Just get you,

1434
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:04,700
uh, if you, if you're not, if
you're not, here's the thing.

1435
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:06,590
Yup.
How much of that,

1436
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:11,220
Blake, for dudes who you, there's
certain cases where you know,

1437
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,240
it's not gonna work. Like
God dammit, this dude,

1438
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:19,450
he's like a small sheep and he married a
wolf or it's just a matter of time for,

1439
01:30:20,031 --> 01:30:23,990
she fleeces him and gets the fuck out
of dodge and hopefully he'll still be

1440
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:26,780
alive, but this is not going to work
out well. We've all seen that before.

1441
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:31,090
Oh, I wish I could tell you this
story. I wish you could too.

1442
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:34,830
Let's shut this fucking podcast off and
resume at 10 minutes. Okay. All right.

1443
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:35,620
Let me,

1444
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:40,360
let me tell you this story because I
just don't want to say it's intertwined

1445
01:30:40,361 --> 01:30:43,050
with something, right, right, right.
But it's very, very pertinent.

1446
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:45,970
You know everything with that.
She was on the legal ramifications.

1447
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:50,360
Can anybody go to jail? No.
Can Anybody get sued? No.

1448
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:55,630
No. I don't think so and
it's the truth. Okay,

1449
01:30:55,631 --> 01:30:59,740
so I'll just create a fictional scenario.
Let's call the gentlemen.

1450
01:30:59,741 --> 01:31:01,600
What do you want to call it?
Let's let let,

1451
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:05,830
let's call him Todd Blaker tie.
Bleeker.

1452
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:10,210
Okay. Now I can't even do it
this way, but I'll get chastised.

1453
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:18,150
I think people would find out slow down
and also I'm drunk and I know you get me

1454
01:31:18,821 --> 01:31:22,510
drunk on your show and Oh, it's my
fault. Give me fucking people on reddit.

1455
01:31:22,511 --> 01:31:25,250
They had their fingers above the
keys. They were hovering, right?

1456
01:31:25,251 --> 01:31:26,380
He starts searching,
right?

1457
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:32,640
There is no such thing as a guide and
I will not tell you the story on this.

1458
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:39,010
Anyway, what was amazing was, I
saw it happening in front of me

1459
01:31:41,650 --> 01:31:46,650
is his wife was there and they'd been
married for a long time and he didn't look

1460
01:31:47,321 --> 01:31:50,950
like much and, and uh, at all.

1461
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,650
And uh,
and,

1462
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:57,400
and there was a kind
of an assistant and uh,

1463
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,820
that was ridiculously

1464
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:04,890
gorgeous. And so I just looked
at that and I was like, uh,

1465
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:13,120
and it went exactly. I've seen where
I thought it was going in and a,

1466
01:32:13,121 --> 01:32:16,150
and there was nothing he can do.
Mean there was absolutely,

1467
01:32:16,151 --> 01:32:17,410
he was completely power

1468
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,510
this person, nothing he could do. He
wouldn't give everything. Oh yeah.

1469
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:27,380
Gary Oldman and Dracula. I remember that
time we were like, what? No, no, Ryan,

1470
01:32:27,381 --> 01:32:30,460
it was just hypnotized by put,

1471
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:33,680
putting a shirt in the middle of the night
and Gary old would be slithering into

1472
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:38,470
the fucking windows as missed
or body heat with, it's like,

1473
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:42,260
oh yeah, with Kathleen Turner towards
the fucking chair through the window,

1474
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:45,610
throw your right in the fucking bat.

1475
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:51,420
He didn't even want to abuse
the door to fuck her. And, uh,

1476
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:55,370
it was great. I was counseling and
turn it back in the desert. Ooh.

1477
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:57,123
How it gets.

1478
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:01,730
I mean she developed some health
problems as she got older,

1479
01:33:01,731 --> 01:33:05,760
but when she was young, holy moly. Yeah.

1480
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:09,910
It was amazing. Yeah.
There was a lot of things

1481
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:12,840
or feel like rubbing went off thinking
about me. Oh, you're your few.

1482
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,180
So go ahead and do it.

1483
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:17,750
Nice. Nice reciprocation. Yeah.

1484
01:33:17,810 --> 01:33:20,930
It's hard when you watching the guy get
preyed upon when you're watching like a

1485
01:33:20,931 --> 01:33:24,980
man's struggle with the fucking spiders
web and you're like, well hey man,

1486
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:29,100
you know, that'd be fun when she
does fuck you right there. Right.

1487
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:33,140
So as long as you can stay
active and get close to her,

1488
01:33:33,141 --> 01:33:36,290
I don't want to get too much money.
It was careful.

1489
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:41,300
Yeah. It, uh, I, I know
because, uh, you know the,

1490
01:33:41,301 --> 01:33:44,870
the, the one I had been around for a long
time and it was a contract, so, right.

1491
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:47,420
Yeah.
So there goes that part of it,

1492
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:53,140
but I think the paperwork was fairly solid
in towards the end of like a limit or

1493
01:33:53,331 --> 01:33:54,350
whatever. Okay. Now

1494
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:58,250
No, keep moving. All right.

1495
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,180
I knew a guy who was about to marry gown
shouldn't know and he was trying to uh,

1496
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:03,710
do uh,

1497
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:08,540
no prenuptial and my friends
were screaming at him like,

1498
01:34:08,541 --> 01:34:13,310
what the fuck are you talking about? And
he's like, look man, I don't if it was,

1499
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:17,630
if it doesn't work out, I'd like her to
have half and then went. But the fun,

1500
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:20,360
it's almost like,
you know,

1501
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:24,020
like you wish you had garlic to put
around you right now you're telling Noah

1502
01:34:24,021 --> 01:34:25,070
about the flood

1503
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:31,280
show really to animals and they both ugly.

1504
01:34:31,281 --> 01:34:35,390
She's not okay.
Understand this world is not fair.

1505
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:40,220
The reality of not fair is you made enough
money to attract her, but she's got a,

1506
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:45,280
she's got a web and you might get hooked
and you might get injected or you might

1507
01:34:45,381 --> 01:34:50,100
be able to figure out a way to keep
her nervous. Right. How do you,

1508
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:54,410
do you gotta act mysterious bro?
I'm serious and I have like a a book.

1509
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:59,240
Is that how you did a, a special books
that you read? You got to be Moody,

1510
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:02,690
got to go on early morning
runs or they're still asleep.

1511
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:05,540
Get to get show powers that they
don't have to do any of these things.

1512
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:09,120
You got to show powers haven't
done one of these things. Yeah.

1513
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:13,790
You have to be different. You have to
be able to quote Shakespeare. Yeah.

1514
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:14,624
You gotta be,

1515
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,480
you gotta be willing to give up a lot of
money if you're not going to do and you

1516
01:35:17,481 --> 01:35:18,314
got a hot wife,

1517
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,590
you've got a certain amount of time
before she gets bored with you fucker

1518
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:22,550
trainer.
Right.

1519
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:27,110
Her trainer here at what I think is
going to happen is within the next week.

1520
01:35:27,150 --> 01:35:30,950
That exact same thing. Oh, I've
seen that happen. Yeah. I've, uh,

1521
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,520
I've been friends with a lot of
people where that's happened. Um,

1522
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:38,570
what I think is going to happen within
the next 50 years is there going to be

1523
01:35:38,571 --> 01:35:43,571
able to eliminate the idea of unattractive
people legitimately through through

1524
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:47,240
DNA. Right. I think they're
gonna be able to do that. We're,

1525
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:50,900
they're not going to know the world that
we knew when we were kids. No Internet,

1526
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:54,410
no fake tits.
Sometimes people were just unattractive.

1527
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,860
No one knew anything about diet.
Nobody worked out. Nobody worked out.

1528
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,100
When I was in high school,
it'd be fucking work.

1529
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:02,870
Dudes would like bench press and shit.
You know,

1530
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:06,290
like how many women lifted weights when
we were in high school and that the

1531
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:09,080
cheerleaders were in good shape.
Yeah, for a little while. Yeah,

1532
01:36:09,081 --> 01:36:12,370
for a little while and I got nobody.
Nobody kept going.

1533
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:16,340
Did Rocky really start like the
big movement started my movement.

1534
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:19,790
I've read about it, but I don't know how
true it is. I was two way too young dude.

1535
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:23,120
When rocky came out,
I think I was seven and a,

1536
01:36:23,121 --> 01:36:27,370
I drank raw eggs and ran around the block
and I told her vessels to load. That

1537
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:32,630
100% did. I was like, Holy
Shit. I want to be a fighter.

1538
01:36:32,631 --> 01:36:36,190
I started drinking eggs and running.
I never ran. Oh, seven years old, man.

1539
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:41,070
Fuck my doing running. Maybe I was eight
head no such effect. Dot. Donta Donta Dah,

1540
01:36:41,071 --> 01:36:43,180
Dah, Dah, Dah. I was like, well, rod

1541
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:49,790
was amazing. He goes eight. I
don't even know how old I was,

1542
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:51,560
but I remember it when it came out.

1543
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:54,440
I've never been more inspired
for something in my life.

1544
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:57,620
I'm moving change the world. People
don't even understand how good it was.

1545
01:36:57,650 --> 01:37:00,110
He lives on my street.
Really? Yeah, he does.

1546
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:03,130
He's on one time driving
his range rover with a,

1547
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:08,210
with a big cockatiel on his shoulder.
Like, well that's Kinda cool. There he is.

1548
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:11,450
There he is running around fucking
weights in his hand and shit.

1549
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:14,630
Why don't we converse all stars? One of
the reasons why we're after this day,

1550
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:17,090
they might not be all stars.
There might be kids.

1551
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:20,810
It might be like some cheap
Walmart version. Who knows?

1552
01:37:20,811 --> 01:37:25,010
But this is some fucking epic shit.
In the 1970s,

1553
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:29,360
what year was this movie?
Let's take a guess.

1554
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:32,820
What year do you think it was?
I want to say it was like 79 yeah,

1555
01:37:32,821 --> 01:37:37,670
76 76 the spirit of 76 was the rematch.

1556
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:40,880
No, there was 76 because
that was when Apollo creed,

1557
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:45,930
I want 76 at a middle as exactly
in one debtors across uh,

1558
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:50,100
uh, I believe it was Alabama. We and uh,

1559
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:54,590
he drove a 1970.
He drove the bicentennial Vega.

1560
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:56,070
Right.

1561
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:00,960
So it was a Vega,
the 76 Vega W had said 76,

1562
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:04,050
you know, some things
that would, you know,

1563
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:08,890
celebrate the sesquicentennial
or whatever it was. Um,

1564
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:13,450
no, it was probably 200 years, I guess.
I don't know. I don't know. A long time.

1565
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:17,620
I was nine years old when this movie
came out and so that's exactly how old I

1566
01:38:17,621 --> 01:38:20,640
was. I got to tell you, is it technique?

1567
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:25,830
Like God needs to tighten up and
swing like the way thrown punches.

1568
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:30,280
So that would been neat to coach.
He needed a coach.

1569
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:33,450
Well he got one in Carl
weathers. This was, uh,

1570
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:38,870
in rocky two rocky to Carl
weathers became as put it,

1571
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,830
was it rocky three three, right, because
that was when he fought Mitchell. Yeah,

1572
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:48,190
that's right. Right.
Yeah. He woman since Amen.

1573
01:38:48,191 --> 01:38:52,060
Ain't got no hot beat. Just stay up
every night wishing he had a real man.

1574
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:55,900
Bring your pretty little cell phone my
apartment tonight and I'll show you a

1575
01:38:55,901 --> 01:38:58,210
real man.
You probably wouldn't say,

1576
01:38:58,330 --> 01:39:01,570
I couldn't believe he was
saying that to rocky. Right,

1577
01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:07,690
right. It was like if he was saying it to
a Wahoo McDaniels, you know? Yeah man. Oh,

1578
01:39:07,691 --> 01:39:10,360
I didn't even finish that story.
Oh yeah. So here's what happened.

1579
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:11,920
My first encounter with the police,

1580
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:15,850
I found out that that the bad
guys were coming out of one side,

1581
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:19,210
one dressing room, and the good guys
were coming out of the other side.

1582
01:39:19,211 --> 01:39:23,290
So I went up to the standards and waited
for the super inferno to come out.

1583
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:27,550
And when he came out, I spit on him.
I just spit on. It was just a big old,

1584
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:33,220
I hate it all. I really, I did. I, I've
never hated anybody who before eight

1585
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:39,550
just spit on him. And uh, then the
cop saw me do it and they came,

1586
01:39:39,551 --> 01:39:42,680
got me and they took me to
my cousin and they were like,

1587
01:39:42,681 --> 01:39:46,510
he spit on a super inferno and he,
you know,

1588
01:39:48,070 --> 01:39:52,450
he was like, oh, that's horrible. And
if he does anything, you just keep,

1589
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:56,530
and so, but afterwards, my cousin thought
it was hilarious. Of course you did.

1590
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:01,450
That's a story. I was trying to put him
out the super inferno. Oh, I get it. Yeah.

1591
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:02,313
It's funny.
Yeah.

1592
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:08,170
I don't think I've ever been to see a
live professional wrestling match other

1593
01:40:08,171 --> 01:40:12,040
than Eleanor Kerrigan from the
comedy store. Well, you know Tony and

1594
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:15,610
uh, uh, those guys, they go to the,

1595
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:20,230
Oh yeah. They were like, you got to go
with this. And I'm like, Nah. You know?

1596
01:40:20,231 --> 01:40:20,960
All right.

1597
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,670
Tony was responsible for 10 minutes of
my last special me shitting on him for

1598
01:40:25,671 --> 01:40:28,790
load probe. Right, right, right.
It was, I remember, I remember.

1599
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:34,940
He loves it. Yeah, he
does that show the four,

1600
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:39,120
what does it call for storm? And
I believe you're storming. It's a,

1601
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:43,470
they do a wrestling podcast from the
comedy store with a bunch of other comics.

1602
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,620
Who were the other guys? Find out their
names. You'll find it out in a line.

1603
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:51,490
But uh, yeah, he loves that Shit.
Loves it. He's always like, dude,

1604
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:53,010
you got to watch it with me.
You'll love it.

1605
01:40:56,900 --> 01:41:01,280
I loved it when I was a kid.
It's the store horsemen.
Horsemen. Oh, perfect sound.

1606
01:41:01,281 --> 01:41:04,400
Right. Who are the gentleman that are
involved in this venture with them?

1607
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:09,680
Fun Show. I did it once. Tony
Hinchcliffe Johnny's Scortis.

1608
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:13,910
Matt Edgar and Josh Martin. There you
go. There you go. Yeah. Chris Burns.

1609
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:18,530
There you go. There you go. Yeah,
they do it from the basement.

1610
01:41:18,531 --> 01:41:20,900
And you've been in that studio
downstairs in the basement.

1611
01:41:20,990 --> 01:41:23,840
I did a podcast out of their
fucking great down there man.

1612
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,930
I love the fact that the comedy
store's embraced podcast.

1613
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:32,140
You know what the comedy store
embraces what's important always.

1614
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:36,140
Yeah. Over any other place. So you know
what they embrace comedians and uh,

1615
01:41:36,141 --> 01:41:40,160
you know, customers really come
second to the comics there.

1616
01:41:40,161 --> 01:41:42,650
So cause there's one parking lot
and people probably not know this,

1617
01:41:42,651 --> 01:41:47,540
but there's one parking lot holds about
30 cars or something like that or 20

1618
01:41:47,541 --> 01:41:50,270
cars or whatever.
And guess who gets to park there?

1619
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:52,370
The comedians that are playing that night,

1620
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:57,080
they get to pull right up and park by
the door. And that is so cool to me.

1621
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,250
And not only that,

1622
01:41:58,251 --> 01:42:01,880
there's a bar that if your name
is not written on that building,

1623
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:06,080
you can't go in it without somebody
who's name is written on that building.

1624
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:07,453
And those are the,

1625
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:12,140
and it's so cool to have your name written
on that building and go to that bar

1626
01:42:12,141 --> 01:42:16,550
that's just for you. And, uh,
and I, I, you know, they, they,

1627
01:42:16,551 --> 01:42:19,790
they have the, my number
one Tequila and, and uh,

1628
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:21,980
I can smoke cigars and not
everybody could spoken there,

1629
01:42:21,981 --> 01:42:24,650
but I get that one little extra deal.
They don't give a fuck.

1630
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:26,490
Don't you do whatever you want in there.

1631
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:31,030
Uh, yeah, yeah. And there's a place
to smoke pot. They built that.

1632
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:36,310
They built a glass piano for prior to
snort cocaine of office because they

1633
01:42:36,311 --> 01:42:39,220
understood, here's what
they understood, Joe,

1634
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,480
here's what they understood.
They understood the comics are insane.

1635
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:48,610
So come be insane here. You know,
if, if you're crazy, we get it.

1636
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:52,620
We don't care. Come be crazy
here. You know, and, and,

1637
01:42:52,621 --> 01:42:54,820
and then at the Improv
you had bud Freeman,

1638
01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:59,550
goat going language language.
Watch your language.

1639
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,510
He's fucking him. Say
that. I heard him say it.

1640
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:05,080
And the first time I ever
came to the comedy store,

1641
01:43:05,081 --> 01:43:08,950
which was probably in 90 or 89,

1642
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:14,050
I made a soldier and out here,
you know, to see what happens.

1643
01:43:14,051 --> 01:43:16,490
So I don't know anything. I don't know
anything. I don't have any friends.

1644
01:43:16,491 --> 01:43:18,610
I don't know. I don't
know anybody. I got it.

1645
01:43:18,611 --> 01:43:23,140
I was in the cheapest hotel room on
sunset boulevard, which were $50,

1646
01:43:23,141 --> 01:43:26,500
which was outrageous back then. And, uh,

1647
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:28,780
and the first day I got into it,

1648
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:33,930
a hotel into an elevator with his huge
black transvestites that there was all

1649
01:43:35,561 --> 01:43:38,640
dressed up going to a show,
going to, uh, to, uh, you know,

1650
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:43,420
one of those big drag queen
shows. And, uh, I was like,

1651
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:47,320
oh, okay. All right. And,
uh, but I went to the,

1652
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:50,210
to the comedy store first and they,
they,

1653
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:54,800
it was a Monday night and they fucking
put me on. I told her I've been doing,

1654
01:43:54,801 --> 01:43:56,870
you know, standup and Texas for, you know,

1655
01:43:56,930 --> 01:44:01,010
a couple of years and they fucking put me
on they, it, and I didn't do very well.

1656
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:05,300
And, uh, not necessarily, you know,

1657
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:09,830
early in the sat, same piano player,
you know, there's nothing changes.

1658
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:15,130
And uh, but I would go to the, to the
Improv and buddy come over to me, he goes,

1659
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:19,040
and he knew me because he'd seen me
do open mic at the Improv and uh,

1660
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:22,250
or be the opening act and they improv in,

1661
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:27,200
in Dallas and he come up to me and Ron,
could you do me a favor? I'm like, yeah,

1662
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:28,034
but what?

1663
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:33,290
Cause you stand over there because you're
blocking the way through here. Okay.

1664
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:38,730
A little further. Okay. Okay. So they
just wouldn't they, you know, they,

1665
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:43,490
I was a new guy, you know, and
all I needed was, you know, uh,

1666
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:48,290
a break whether I deserved it or not,
they gave it to me. It's a, it's a store.

1667
01:44:48,291 --> 01:44:51,040
The store has a heart that
way, you know, they, the,

1668
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:55,750
well, they, the, the store
is, the art form is primary.

1669
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:58,150
That's everything. It's everything. It's,

1670
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,940
everything is built around that art form.

1671
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,070
He didn't use to let the
agents and the managers in

1672
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:09,730
the pot, you got to buy a ticket
if you like. We're a CIA agent.

1673
01:45:09,731 --> 01:45:13,330
You want to come see this guy or that
Guy Ron White, he had a buy a ticket.

1674
01:45:13,810 --> 01:45:17,370
That's the only place in town cause so
the agents couldn't just come in and and

1675
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:19,390
run the place like they
did in a lot of places.

1676
01:45:19,391 --> 01:45:21,880
They would come and they would be
in the back of the room talking.

1677
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:27,190
I remember I went to a showcase once,
it was a backward William Morris, uh,

1678
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:31,210
put on this showcase of the comedians they
represented and they did it in a club,

1679
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,280
like a nightclub on sunset.

1680
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:37,120
And Nick Depaula was onstage and
they asked me to perform like,

1681
01:45:37,121 --> 01:45:38,410
you're out of your fucking mind.
I'm like,

1682
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:41,850
there's no way I'm going to perform at
this. I know what this is. I'm like, I'm,

1683
01:45:41,851 --> 01:45:44,620
I'm not looking to get hired for
anybody. Merde represented. I go,

1684
01:45:44,621 --> 01:45:46,870
I'm going to watch,
like this is going to be a disaster.

1685
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:52,050
So I go with my manager and I'm in
the top level and everyone's talking.

1686
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:57,910
All these fucking agents
and agents assistance,

1687
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,040
they're not even watching, no
reason. Not even watching Ron.

1688
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:07,090
And so I'm watching these guys struggle
on stage where no one John Henson goes

1689
01:46:07,091 --> 01:46:10,210
up and then Nick Depalo goes up and
nick was the only one who said anything

1690
01:46:10,211 --> 01:46:13,270
about it and about everybody
fucking talking at the top. Like,

1691
01:46:13,271 --> 01:46:16,730
these are my fucking agents.
This is unbelievable. He
was, he was making fun of it,

1692
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,870
but it was,
the comedy store would never allow that.

1693
01:46:19,871 --> 01:46:23,450
They would kick everybody out of that
room. Get the fuck out of here. Right.

1694
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:27,370
I get Outta here.
And they still to this day,

1695
01:46:27,371 --> 01:46:30,090
don't tolerate that kind of shit at a,

1696
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:33,490
they don't breed that
kind of thing in college.

1697
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:38,360
Let me go on record as
saying this, Joe. Hey, uh,

1698
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:43,990
I'm not saying I don't like the other
rooms and I'm not saying I'm not glad

1699
01:46:43,991 --> 01:46:47,830
they're there. And I'm not saying I don't
need them as bad as I need the store.

1700
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,380
Uh, uh, they're,

1701
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:54,390
they're good solid comedy rooms and
I think they're trying to make the

1702
01:46:54,391 --> 01:46:55,550
adjustments and they're starting,

1703
01:46:55,551 --> 01:46:58,770
because somebody asked me the other
day at one of the other clubs,

1704
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:02,070
one of the comics hanging out at
the comedy store. I'm like, Oh yeah,

1705
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:05,220
let me tell you. So on
number one, Eh, you know,

1706
01:47:05,221 --> 01:47:09,990
so my Tequila and they do and uh,
and but also they,

1707
01:47:09,991 --> 01:47:14,190
they, when I come to your
place, I got either I got to,

1708
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:16,080
I got to Valet Park and pay for it.

1709
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:20,940
You pay me $25 to do a set,
they pay me $35.

1710
01:47:20,941 --> 01:47:22,620
Now both of these numbers are low,

1711
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:28,810
but to some comics they'd rather have that
of the, and they noticed the 10 bucks,

1712
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:29,161
you know,

1713
01:47:29,161 --> 01:47:33,670
she need the money and a lot of cases
that you have to choose between those two

1714
01:47:33,671 --> 01:47:38,030
clubs. You, is it still that
way? I mean, I know it was, no,

1715
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:40,870
the store and the Improv in
particular get along really well.

1716
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:43,210
We get along really well now.
And Paige,

1717
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:46,900
who does all the booking for the Improv
is always at the store and she's good

1718
01:47:46,901 --> 01:47:50,990
friends with Adam. Okay.
That's good. Yeah. That's,

1719
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:53,950
I offered you a spot on the show that
I'm doing tonight at the Improv if you

1720
01:47:53,951 --> 01:47:57,030
wanted to do it because I'm
there when I have time. Yeah.

1721
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:59,560
You're doing a show tonight. Yeah, I'm
doing a show at eight o'clock tonight.

1722
01:47:59,561 --> 01:48:01,660
The improv was, you had another
one Thursday night at the Improv.

1723
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:07,130
Anytime other than one tonight. Uh, full
of like Yam, Ron White. Beautiful. I mean,

1724
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:12,160
I drunk at my now and the perfect
time, it's five o'clock. Alright.

1725
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:14,320
By the time eight o'clock rolls around,
you'll be simmered.

1726
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:18,360
You'll be like braised beef with
her having to need Adderall.

1727
01:48:18,370 --> 01:48:19,540
It'd be falling off the bone.

1728
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:23,290
That's what I want you putting it into
your schedule. It's three hours from now.

1729
01:48:23,291 --> 01:48:27,610
Go Oh Jay McGraw or your your boy.
I love him.

1730
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,640
I had his daddy on the show.
I know he's calling me now.

1731
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:36,040
It was dropping science and his Daddy,
his dad's a fucking genius.

1732
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:40,810
Doctor Phil. Yep. He's a great
guy. Like people who don't know,

1733
01:48:40,811 --> 01:48:43,870
Dr Phil,
he's a fucking great guy.

1734
01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:47,500
You know it, it's uh, he,

1735
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:51,630
he sent me a text the other day
and he goes, I've got this idea.

1736
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:55,230
You're going to think it's
crazy. And, uh, so we,

1737
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,980
we made it the Beverly Hills Hotel and,
uh,

1738
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:02,200
and I play a lot of golf
with doc and I know him well,

1739
01:49:02,201 --> 01:49:06,580
and I have for 10 years or
whatever, who's dot Dr Phil. Oh

1740
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:11,280
yeah. Who Do you remember who
we're talking about? We said Doc,

1741
01:49:11,281 --> 01:49:14,280
I never called the Dotcom fell.
Oh, I thought I call him doc.

1742
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,730
Jay's daddy can shake them out
and play it. That's what I said.

1743
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:21,420
He goes, all right,
here's what we should do.

1744
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:27,990
We should do a two man
show. And uh, and uh,

1745
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:32,340
and I know he's out of production and
I know he's bored and he's also hurts.

1746
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:35,170
So he's had that motorcycle
wreck and you know,

1747
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:39,780
it's getting new shoulder surgery. Right.
So he's like, he really can't play golf.

1748
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:44,800
I don't know. He's just bored. And
so it, so it really is and, and,

1749
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:48,430
and I would do anything doctor
Phil wanted to do, you know,

1750
01:49:48,431 --> 01:49:51,460
cause I love spending
the time with him and uh,

1751
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:55,360
and the add or anything he does is a
big success anyway, so I would do it.

1752
01:49:55,720 --> 01:50:00,520
But he really, he, he here
was his idea. It's a, it's a,

1753
01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:05,530
it's a two man show on Broadway.
Right.

1754
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:10,370
And he goes, and then, you know,

1755
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:13,960
I'm not sure how it starts and I'm like,
okay,

1756
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:17,200
it would probably start with the curtain
opens and you and I are standing there

1757
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:21,190
because it's a two man show on Broadway.
That's probably how it starts.

1758
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:23,950
And he goes in there, we could
do a Q and a and I'm like, no,

1759
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:27,220
we'd have to do something
before the Q and a doc. Right.

1760
01:50:27,221 --> 01:50:30,160
Because when we've done that
before and it's Hilarious, right.

1761
01:50:30,161 --> 01:50:33,100
Are just as close as we are.
I mean the,

1762
01:50:33,101 --> 01:50:38,050
where we're born and our
circumstances in life and,

1763
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:40,310
uh, and, and,

1764
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:45,430
and he's completely under missionally
fun fucking beyond me as far as any kind

1765
01:50:46,631 --> 01:50:48,520
of success that anybody's ever had.

1766
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:53,740
But it wa but we both came from
nothing in the same part of the world.

1767
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:57,910
And so we have this connection that
people have a hard time understanding,

1768
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:01,630
you know, they can't believe you
and doctor Phil or they literally,

1769
01:51:02,110 --> 01:51:06,710
we tell people we love each other.
And that's, I mean, and, and, and,

1770
01:51:06,770 --> 01:51:09,880
and to give you a good example that he
took me dive and we flew in his golf

1771
01:51:09,881 --> 01:51:13,510
stream to the Cayman Islands. And I didn't
even have a certificate or anything,

1772
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,730
but I'd had one.
It was just expired.

1773
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:21,090
And so we went on this dive and he
watched me like I was four years old the

1774
01:51:22,901 --> 01:51:26,070
whole time we were underwater and a,

1775
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:28,760
if I got close to something
I shouldn't touch, you know,

1776
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:36,280
so, so I know he loves me, right.
I know he loves me and, and uh,

1777
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:41,110
and so, but there, we
really didn't have an idea,

1778
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:43,270
but I just knew that I knew that he was,

1779
01:51:43,390 --> 01:51:47,680
that he was bored and any want to have
lunch and talk about something, I'm like,

1780
01:51:47,681 --> 01:51:50,080
let's talk about it. I,
cause I would do anything.

1781
01:51:50,081 --> 01:51:52,330
I would love to figure out
something to do with him.

1782
01:51:52,690 --> 01:51:57,070
That makes sense because we would, because
we come off really fun together in uh,

1783
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,020
in, in, in a,

1784
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:04,140
in a juxtaposition
situation. Right. And, uh,

1785
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:06,490
our views, even though we come
from a similar background,

1786
01:52:06,491 --> 01:52:09,820
how different the views are in some
ways now several, they are in some ways.

1787
01:52:09,821 --> 01:52:14,110
So it's fun stuff. We should do
your podcast together. Love it.

1788
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:20,560
Yeah. He just did it. He just did it
like a two weeks. Yeah, I knew that.

1789
01:52:20,610 --> 01:52:25,390
I knew that that was, that he told
me. Hmm. Now he's exceptional.

1790
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:29,020
Love that guy. He's fucking easy going
guy too. I'm really happy to be around.

1791
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:33,030
Right. You know, like comfortable
in his own skin. See, you know,

1792
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:36,240
was a reason why so successful. Right.
It's not like anybody could do that. Like,

1793
01:52:36,241 --> 01:52:40,630
look at that Doctor Oz guy. I talked to
Roz guy, I'm watching him and I was like,

1794
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:44,890
ah, I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know doc. Well,

1795
01:52:44,910 --> 01:52:45,381
you know,
he,

1796
01:52:45,381 --> 01:52:50,381
he does three unscripted
hours a day all day,

1797
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:52,220
a podcast now.

1798
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:57,260
And I did his podcast because
also during that lunch he said,

1799
01:52:57,290 --> 01:53:00,690
also, I have a podcast and I'm
going to start it up and, uh, want,

1800
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,990
I'm going to do a few people before I do.

1801
01:53:02,991 --> 01:53:05,660
You just get used to it and
then have you come on. I'm like,

1802
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:07,880
well for sure I'll do that.
How funny is that?

1803
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:10,790
He thinks he's needs to get
used to it. Alright. Yeah.

1804
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:15,500
He just unscripted television along with
a camera in his face all day long. Well,

1805
01:53:15,501 --> 01:53:17,180
it turns out he didn't
need to get used to it.

1806
01:53:17,181 --> 01:53:18,790
He was great at it from
the very beginning.

1807
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:24,620
That's the same exact skill. He talks to
people. He knows how to talk to people.

1808
01:53:24,621 --> 01:53:27,410
He knows how to listen. That's the, yeah,

1809
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:31,220
that's what is missing in a lot of people
when it comes to the area where I've

1810
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:35,420
played golf when the one time when I
was going through a divorce and, uh,

1811
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:39,950
people ask me does he give
unsolicited advice? And I'm like,

1812
01:53:39,951 --> 01:53:43,460
he doesn't give solicited advice,
even if you asked.

1813
01:53:43,461 --> 01:53:47,120
So I'm playing golf with him and I'm like,
doc,

1814
01:53:49,170 --> 01:53:53,270
there's uh, there's divorce is
killing me. It's just killing me.

1815
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:58,820
And he goes, keep your head still when
you put much what he said. And I'm like,

1816
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:02,750
what? He goes, keep your
head still when you put you,

1817
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:05,210
you're in a better mood
when you putt well,

1818
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:07,040
but you're moving your
head all over the place.

1819
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:10,070
So why don't we start with keep
your hands still when you Putt,

1820
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:14,120
which now is a metaphor for a lot of
things to me is keep your head still when

1821
01:54:14,121 --> 01:54:17,000
you Putt, you know, do
what you do well. You know,

1822
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:19,100
it's what makes you feel bad or whatever,
you know.

1823
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:21,980
But in that particular case that there,

1824
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:24,950
those were really simple words and I know
they were right off the cuff and I've

1825
01:54:24,951 --> 01:54:28,820
thought about them all the time since
you keep your head still when you Putt,

1826
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:31,520
that's solid advice. Yeah. So it's,

1827
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:36,650
so it's a little bee bee be more
centered me and you know it in the zone.

1828
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:40,940
I'm not if you were playing pool to keep
your head down when you shoot. Right.

1829
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:43,760
He had done when you shoot on the shot.
Right.

1830
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:47,250
And that was a fall through but,

1831
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:50,690
but you wouldn't exactly call
it advice but it, but it was,

1832
01:54:50,691 --> 01:54:53,810
it was something I listen to and continue
to think about to this fucking day.

1833
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,250
It is advice because if you're
really good at golf in that respect,

1834
01:54:57,610 --> 01:55:02,080
if you know how to not move your head
like that's a discipline where you can,

1835
01:55:02,081 --> 01:55:04,850
you can apply that to the rest of your
life right here. You know, you're,

1836
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:07,840
if you're loose and you're not drinking
and you're fucked up and you're not

1837
01:55:07,841 --> 01:55:10,870
using good technique, your head's
going to be all over the place. Right.

1838
01:55:11,170 --> 01:55:14,980
Same thing of pool stay down in your
right now. Archery. Yup. Oh yeah.

1839
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:19,090
Camera is still fall through.
Correct. Follow through.

1840
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:21,310
It's very important.
Some more.

1841
01:55:21,311 --> 01:55:24,040
Do you try to control it and
be all herky jerky and shit.

1842
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:26,890
Archery archery's a incredible,

1843
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,890
one of the most zen things I've
ever done in my life, surprisingly,

1844
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:32,440
surprisingly zen,
you

1845
01:55:32,450 --> 01:55:35,180
know, Foxworthy. When he built
his big house in Georgia,

1846
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:40,100
he had a deer set up dear target set up
that he could walk out on the balcony of

1847
01:55:40,101 --> 01:55:43,300
his office.
Yeah,

1848
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,400
I have them in my yard.
I'm all over the place,

1849
01:55:46,450 --> 01:55:48,060
the deer problem in our neighborhood.
And they said,

1850
01:55:48,061 --> 01:55:52,770
you know what you had to do just shut
the gate and turn Foxworthy loose in here

1851
01:55:52,771 --> 01:55:56,250
with a Phyllo and he would
kill everything in here.

1852
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:59,880
He's a natural born killer is going to
be real careful with people shooting

1853
01:55:59,881 --> 01:56:02,670
arrows and neighborhoods. They do
that in certain places. They have,

1854
01:56:03,490 --> 01:56:08,490
he's a residential deer hunting permits
where there a allow bow hunters to come

1855
01:56:10,021 --> 01:56:13,710
in and shoot deer in,
you know,

1856
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:15,210
suburban communities.

1857
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:19,260
Cause they just have such
an overpopulation of too
many people are hitting them

1858
01:56:19,261 --> 01:56:22,770
with their cars. And Yeah.
So like this place is like,

1859
01:56:23,070 --> 01:56:27,570
I think there was one place in Texas,
Jane, feed them Doritos out of your hand.

1860
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:31,020
They'll just spread around you and
go, yeah, here's a bag of Doritos.

1861
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:34,100
Especially those high fence places, right,
where they have feeders set up a forum.

1862
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:38,160
Um, there's, there's a place in tech
in Pennsylvania look up. This is true.

1863
01:56:38,161 --> 01:56:41,810
There's a neighborhood where you can
hunt deer there through my meditation.

1864
01:56:41,830 --> 01:56:46,430
A piggy or a pig story, Tommy? No, no,
no, no. Go ahead. No, I'm done. All right.

1865
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:47,390
Jamie,

1866
01:56:47,390 --> 01:56:51,270
will Google the Pennsylvania place
where you can hunt deer 365 days a year.

1867
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,180
All right,
so let me,

1868
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:54,540
well, we figured out a way
to tell the story. Okay.

1869
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,560
Jay or buddy Jay McGuire
op is a TV producer, right?

1870
01:57:00,561 --> 01:57:01,131
So they,

1871
01:57:01,131 --> 01:57:06,131
they produce the doctors and the
doctor feels show and the bull on CBS,

1872
01:57:07,131 --> 01:57:11,510
but they also have another 10 or
12 shows on any level of cable.

1873
01:57:11,511 --> 01:57:14,180
And if they could sell it, they'll
make it as a TV production company.

1874
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:19,940
So the guy that made the movie,

1875
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:22,550
and I always grew up his name,
so I'm going to have you look it up.

1876
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:27,790
Did the movie about the the kid and
we took 16 years to make link as well.

1877
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:32,940
Why am I saying it right? I'm from
Texas. I don't know that movie.

1878
01:57:32,941 --> 01:57:35,910
What was that movie? They followed him
from the time he was a kid. It the APP,

1879
01:57:35,911 --> 01:57:40,710
but the movie took 16 years to make. Oh
yeah. It was called about a boy, boy.

1880
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:43,710
Boy, boy. Yeah. Yeah.
So, and the director was

1881
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:49,940
James got a lot of tabs
open, I think. Lean clatter.

1882
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:54,440
Yup. Yup. And so

1883
01:57:56,360 --> 01:58:00,610
he, he, um, he, he bought two.

1884
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:04,580
Uh, I just want to get
the story right. Got It.

1885
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:09,920
He bought two miniature potbelly pigs
that turned out to be not manager potbelly

1886
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:16,480
pig Whitney Cummings has, that's not
real at all those miniature pigs.

1887
01:58:16,481 --> 01:58:19,570
It just starved a little pigs.
Let me, okay, let me finish.

1888
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:23,820
Let me finish. All right. So he

1889
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:29,700
needs to find something
to do with these pigs.

1890
01:58:29,701 --> 01:58:32,820
And it turns out in Bastrop,
Texas where he lives now.

1891
01:58:32,821 --> 01:58:36,150
This is a very famous artistic,

1892
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:41,100
probably one of the best directors
alive. And he's from Texas. He did,

1893
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:45,500
he did the first movie with
Matthew mcconaughey. Hey,
uh, about living in Austin.

1894
01:58:45,501 --> 01:58:49,360
And I, I, and I, I, you know, you
just give me so wasted on this show.

1895
01:58:49,361 --> 01:58:54,340
I can't ever remember anything.
But anyway, Connie with
AIDS, right? No, no, no, no,

1896
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:55,040
no,
no.

1897
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:59,260
So this was the first thing Matthew
mcconahey really discovered mcconaughey in

1898
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:03,920
when he was going to University
of Texas and did a movie Wat.

1899
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:09,520
Wow. We've got to start bringing
a friend with me. Um, what is it?

1900
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:16,390
I Dunno when you just talked
about yeah, no, no, no, no.

1901
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:21,070
The Matthew mcconaughey and that director,

1902
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:24,650
first movie Matthew Mcconaughey ever
did I think, was it tasting confused,

1903
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:29,090
confused. [inaudible] old school.
Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright.

1904
01:59:30,370 --> 01:59:34,660
So, oh, okay. Was it do deer
thing? True. Yes. I found a
neighborhood where it's true,

1905
01:59:34,661 --> 01:59:38,770
but I'll wait. Okay. So here and I'm
going to insert a story. All right,

1906
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:42,160
so this is my Matthew mcconaughey story.
When I was moving to Austin,

1907
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:47,560
I have friends there that
are, you know, I like Austin.

1908
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:49,660
I got friends, but I
always thought, you know,

1909
01:59:49,661 --> 01:59:52,900
I'll end up being friends with Matthew
mcconaughey and, uh, because we,

1910
01:59:52,910 --> 01:59:56,490
we know a lot of the same people, you
know, and, uh, and we both spoke power.

1911
01:59:56,491 --> 02:00:00,970
We're both from Texas, we're boat
and this will happen. And, uh,

1912
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:04,030
and I love him and I really like
working with Wade and I was like, oh,

1913
02:00:04,031 --> 02:00:07,180
that's what we friends, it'll
be great. That'd be great.
Part of my thing. Awesome.

1914
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:09,360
So Amit,

1915
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:14,170
Matthew mcconaughey had a charity event,
but in,

1916
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:17,350
in this scenario I have
imagined him saying,

1917
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:21,550
your Ryan White,
you're my favorite comedian ever.

1918
02:00:22,030 --> 02:00:26,410
I got a hot tub going off in my backyard
with a couple of girls and I got these

1919
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:29,260
great fucking joints and we'll
go over there and smoke pot,

1920
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:31,000
drink Tequila and sec.

1921
02:00:32,590 --> 02:00:35,050
But what happened was he went,

1922
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:37,570
Oh nice to me.
And then he went on to me,

1923
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:40,940
the next person and it was a long
pause there where I should have said,

1924
02:00:40,941 --> 02:00:41,840
I love your work,

1925
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:45,380
but I didn't because I already had it
planned out that he was supposed to say

1926
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:50,300
how much he loved me.
And so I just left a long pause there.

1927
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:53,840
And then when it was all over with, I
said, I shouldn't tell him I loved him.

1928
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,420
I told him,
I told him I loved him but I didn't

1929
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:02,070
planning. So anyway,
back to the big store. So

1930
02:01:04,710 --> 02:01:09,530
this guy finds the pig rescue and,
uh,

1931
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:14,110
decides he wants to do a documentary
about it. Well, he calls, uh,

1932
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:19,120
Jay McGraw's, right hand girl and
the right hand girl, right woman,

1933
02:01:19,121 --> 02:01:20,500
brilliant girl that runs

1934
02:01:20,730 --> 02:01:22,620
things for Jay.

1935
02:01:22,621 --> 02:01:25,170
And I can't remember her name because
I'm an idiot and I've met her two times,

1936
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:28,710
but, uh, and uh,

1937
02:01:28,770 --> 02:01:32,220
and says I'd like to do a
documentary on is this thing.

1938
02:01:32,221 --> 02:01:36,210
So she tells Jay and he
goes, Linklater, all right.

1939
02:01:37,110 --> 02:01:38,820
Yeah.
So he calls cvs.

1940
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:45,080
I don't even know. I should be telling a
story. And they, and they say, fuck yeah,

1941
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:48,850
we'll do anything he wants to do is he's
got his name on it, right? He's, uh,

1942
02:01:50,250 --> 02:01:53,300
he's got a movie coming out with Cate
Blanchett as opposed to when everything

1943
02:01:53,301 --> 02:01:56,510
there is, and he's an
amazing guy. Just an artist,

1944
02:01:56,511 --> 02:01:59,030
doesn't care at thing about anything,

1945
02:01:59,031 --> 02:02:02,400
but art doesn't matter if it takes 16
years to make. This guy's amazing. I,

1946
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:07,890
so Jay has this idea of us do, and, um,

1947
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:10,910
uh,
Judge Roy Bean with me as judge,

1948
02:02:10,911 --> 02:02:13,610
where we've been been
doing a comedy and a,

1949
02:02:13,710 --> 02:02:16,010
or we were not even zeroed in on what,

1950
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:21,011
but we liked me doing that character
of preacher Hang Lynn Barr Tinder,

1951
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:25,670
right? So, uh, and I would
like to play the role,

1952
02:02:25,671 --> 02:02:30,200
and I wouldn't mind finding a TV show
to settle into at my age, you know,

1953
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:32,600
for awhile, you know, if I could do it,

1954
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:37,190
but it's gotta be the right thing with the
right people, or I won't do it. And, uh,

1955
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:43,120
so CBS says, yeah, we'll do
it. You know, the fuck out.

1956
02:02:43,121 --> 02:02:45,490
We'll do it. And, uh, so
they're, they're gonna make,

1957
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:48,680
they're going to have a meeting. And
so Jay calls me and he goes, well,

1958
02:02:48,681 --> 02:02:50,930
why don't we talk to them about this
George judge, where being thing.

1959
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:56,230
So I live in Austin, right? So I'm
writing 27 miles from bass drop.

1960
02:02:56,231 --> 02:02:57,064
And then,

1961
02:02:57,080 --> 02:03:00,080
so I can go out there for the meeting
and it's in this little restaurant on a

1962
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:02,690
river. And, and, uh,

1963
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:05,960
and they talk about that for a little
while and then we talk a little bit about

1964
02:03:05,961 --> 02:03:10,810
Judge Roy Bean and then it's time
to go to the pig rescue. Well,

1965
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:13,610
I don't have to go to the pig
rescue, but now I'm a big, you know,

1966
02:03:13,611 --> 02:03:16,340
I really want him to track this
film because I know if he does,

1967
02:03:16,370 --> 02:03:20,300
it'll be made a film, you know, it'll
be, it'll be a big thing if he does it.

1968
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:24,890
So I go 250 pigs,

1969
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:30,650
well kept and well fed,
fenced in in pins.

1970
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:32,091
They actually,

1971
02:03:32,091 --> 02:03:37,091
there's a feral pig problem in that part
of Texas and they have these cameras

1972
02:03:37,821 --> 02:03:42,821
that are Predator cameras and they have
footage of these huge feral pigs walking

1973
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:47,240
up to this fence looking at these pigs
going, how'd y'all get in here? Really?

1974
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:51,980
Whether you laying in the mud and they
bring you food when we don't even know,

1975
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:55,190
wait an hour. We got in here
where it is in here. And uh,

1976
02:03:55,290 --> 02:03:58,100
and they're anywhere from,

1977
02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:02,840
they had some rescues that were
little bitty to 750 pound pigs.

1978
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:08,450
All of them sold the same premise
that these are miniature pigs and a,

1979
02:04:08,451 --> 02:04:13,070
it'd be 150 pounds.
750 pounds science.

1980
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:16,970
Your pigs. Yeah. Alex
Raimundo about three up.

1981
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:20,300
You think I'm given,

1982
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:25,760
he bought three up and turn them loose
in the wild and they turned into pig.

1983
02:04:25,761 --> 02:04:29,390
What are you going to do? Well, he
lived up in, uh, up in the whatever,

1984
02:04:29,391 --> 02:04:32,490
the high mountains. He's part of the
problem. Right? Part of the problem.

1985
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:37,010
Not Problem. Okay, here
you go. So I'm walking,

1986
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:40,920
it's all, it's all it's, it's well done.

1987
02:04:40,921 --> 02:04:44,970
And this guy seems really
reasonable. Right. And uh,

1988
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:48,930
uh, and he's also an executive
for a construction company,

1989
02:04:48,931 --> 02:04:52,450
a big construction company. And
this is his passion. And then,

1990
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:55,980
and then it was all right. This
is the part I can't tell. So

1991
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:02,690
we, yeah. Oh fuck. Yeah. I say
this part of it, I understand.

1992
02:05:02,730 --> 02:05:07,450
And a pig, so, and I ended up
liking the pigs. You know, they're,

1993
02:05:07,451 --> 02:05:11,640
they're, they're nice. If you scratch him,
hey, they have arthritis of the big ones.

1994
02:05:11,641 --> 02:05:15,770
I can get around and, but
it's basically, it's a

1995
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:18,040
WHO's going to save his pig

1996
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:21,220
kind of an operation. And I'm like, well,

1997
02:05:21,221 --> 02:05:25,670
do you know the Carnita
Gat, the wood, you know,

1998
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:30,270
probably pitch and you know, if
want wanting to retire, you know,

1999
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:33,930
cause I asked the guy,
I said, what's the, um,

2000
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:39,600
where do they go from
here? And it goes, so, um,

2001
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:44,460
so he, there's someone adopts them or
they get turned to bacon. They, uh,

2002
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:47,940
no, they, that's it. They, they
lived there until they die. Wow.

2003
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:52,770
Is the way I understand weird
because they're almost, oh. Dot here.

2004
02:05:52,771 --> 02:05:53,700
I left this part out.
Oh.

2005
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:59,660
So we're in the house talking
about the ship and uh,

2006
02:06:00,210 --> 02:06:01,470
and haven't had enough of it.

2007
02:06:01,530 --> 02:06:05,280
And I've got a joint in my pocket and I
really want to smoke some pot and hang

2008
02:06:05,281 --> 02:06:08,370
with the pigs because it seems like that
would be really fucking fine. You know,

2009
02:06:08,371 --> 02:06:11,640
just a scratch on the pigs.
All stolen new shit.

2010
02:06:11,641 --> 02:06:14,940
And that's how mature I am.
Uh,

2011
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:19,470
and so there's, this big comes out
of the back squealing and they go,

2012
02:06:19,471 --> 02:06:21,210
that's Whitney Cummings pig.

2013
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:23,310
Ah,

2014
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:26,690
so she rescued a pig
during the Malibu fires.

2015
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:30,650
She documented it very heavily on
her Instagram. Yeah. Show it to you.

2016
02:06:31,790 --> 02:06:32,180
Okay.

2017
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:35,690
I've seen her pig, uh, know
I saw it in person person.

2018
02:06:35,870 --> 02:06:37,360
That's Whitney Cummings pigs.

2019
02:06:37,610 --> 02:06:40,510
So they're like a couple of nights
later I'm up at the store and Whitney

2020
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:44,390
Cummings is there and I go,
oh, where do you see this?

2021
02:06:44,450 --> 02:06:49,400
She drove that fucking pigs all the way
across and be like two days of driving.

2022
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:50,300
She's insane.

2023
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:56,750
Trove a pig in a car for
two days to a pig sanctuary.

2024
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:00,150
That is ridiculous.

2025
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:07,220
It's Hilarious, dude. It's Whitney
Cummings pig. That's hilarious.

2026
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:10,720
That's crazy. I want to hear more of
the story, but I got to Piss so bad.

2027
02:07:10,721 --> 02:07:14,540
I'm gonna pee my pants. Two podcasts
in a row. Talk to this guy. Hey,

2028
02:07:14,810 --> 02:07:17,660
I'll be right back. We can't just
cut the thing off for awhile.

2029
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:22,300
We could just cut it off.
Totally. No, I don't, I don't,

2030
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:26,420
I don't want to end it because it's
five 30. Yeah, yeah. We'll wait.

2031
02:07:27,290 --> 02:07:31,490
I got another to do. I got no where
to be so bad. Sorry. I saw it.

2032
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:33,140
How was that you ran
until Tony last night?

2033
02:07:33,170 --> 02:07:36,310
You're telling me I had a good
time there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh,

2034
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:40,830
it was, uh, it was just a
gas. I had a friend, uh,

2035
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:43,630
uh, I had dinner with
friends that night and, uh,

2036
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:47,770
in Malibu and then came out and
did that side. And, uh, and it was,

2037
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:50,980
it's just a great idea for a show,
the kill Tony Show,

2038
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:56,620
if you have a chance to download a that
podcast. Uh, it's a, it's a hoot. It's,

2039
02:07:56,621 --> 02:07:57,980
it,
it's so much fun to do it.

2040
02:07:57,981 --> 02:08:02,200
So that a live audience down
to the comedy store and a,

2041
02:08:02,201 --> 02:08:05,610
it's a great premise and I won't
bore you with all the detailed,

2042
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:07,210
but she can just tune in and

2043
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:11,160
if you check the video, it
probably is up on Youtube. Oh yeah.

2044
02:08:11,790 --> 02:08:14,170
It's a big, it's not a, it's not Joe show,

2045
02:08:14,171 --> 02:08:19,171
but it's a big thing that does to the
band just shop as they look like how many

2046
02:08:19,481 --> 02:08:21,670
guys? Oh, they were, oh, it was so funny.

2047
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:25,520
Jeremiah doing Foxworthy was,
uh,

2048
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:31,450
was it really would Jeremiah
just makes me laugh so hard.

2049
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:36,140
Everything he does just kills
me. And uh, he'll be, you know,

2050
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:41,380
hopefully in my old age you'll be given
me mercy work because I'd tell him how

2051
02:08:41,381 --> 02:08:42,214
good he is.

2052
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:45,940
He has his own podcast too.
I thought Jeremiah wonders where he does,

2053
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:48,890
he does some voices and whatnot.
And so does he ever got it?

2054
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:51,040
Cause it doesn't have guests. You should
probably just talk to him about it.

2055
02:08:51,041 --> 02:08:52,720
I don't know that.
I didn't know that you weren't on it.

2056
02:08:52,721 --> 02:08:53,770
I didn't want to say it that way,
but

2057
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:57,840
you know, I haven't
been on it. Uh, the uh,

2058
02:08:58,530 --> 02:09:01,620
I always wonder why Bill Byrd didn't
have me on his show and the fact that he

2059
02:09:01,621 --> 02:09:02,690
didn't have anybody to share

2060
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:04,160
by himself.
Some people,

2061
02:09:04,161 --> 02:09:06,860
a lot of Comedians crystally it
doesn't all by himself too. Oh really?

2062
02:09:06,861 --> 02:09:09,470
He said like one guest on, I think it
was just his brother for a special,

2063
02:09:09,471 --> 02:09:12,930
but he's done 130 or so all by himself.
It's a lot.

2064
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,390
You could do one prior all by herself too.

2065
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:18,640
You know what, I prefer
not to. I've got to,

2066
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:23,230
I've got to save up thoughts for
eight months to do the Rogan show.

2067
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:24,200
And

2068
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:27,810
so I, so I'm loyal to the,
I'm loyal to this show.

2069
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:33,240
Huh? Do you know what that is?
No. Mitzi shore. Oh, wow. Yeah.

2070
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:39,310
Uh, our friend Taylor Taylor boss,
he painted that for me. Wow. How bad.

2071
02:09:39,311 --> 02:09:41,710
I says that,
that's an old

2072
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:44,910
picture. Mitzi when she
or he is cute. Cute.

2073
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:47,830
Very hot. She was, uh,

2074
02:09:47,890 --> 02:09:50,110
one of the most important figures
in the history of the comedy,

2075
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:55,420
one of the most important figures in my
life for sure. That lady mentored me.

2076
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:56,403
All of us.

2077
02:09:56,830 --> 02:10:00,400
I mean, all of us, because that's
the only reason the store exists.

2078
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:02,620
The inmates run the asylum.
Right.

2079
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:06,280
She's the only person that let the inmate
understood it in the mental hospital.

2080
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:08,150
That's the actual original pressure over.

2081
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:11,450
Great. Is that, ah, it's fucking amazing.

2082
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:13,490
She's like Betty White.

2083
02:10:13,491 --> 02:10:17,440
You ever see those titty pictures of
Betty White when she was like 21 year

2084
02:10:17,441 --> 02:10:17,720
though?

2085
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:20,420
Yeah.
He was so crazy and wild.

2086
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:25,690
It's all right that she's got her nipples
in that picture. Right. She's, uh,

2087
02:10:26,090 --> 02:10:30,320
our friend rose, who's a tailor, his
girlfriend, uh, put a post on her. Uh,

2088
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:31,513
when she died,

2089
02:10:31,670 --> 02:10:35,900
I couldn't repost it like for any other
woman I met might be able to repost it.

2090
02:10:35,901 --> 02:10:36,734
But she said like,

2091
02:10:38,170 --> 02:10:41,450
I forget what she called or something
about something she called her like the

2092
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:45,170
greatest boss Bitch and history.
Like I can't,

2093
02:10:45,230 --> 02:10:49,940
I can't say that I like it, but
I can't repost that. You know,

2094
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:53,690
it just didn't you just
say it? Yeah. But I mean,

2095
02:10:53,691 --> 02:10:56,480
I can't say I can't put it
on my Instagram, you know,

2096
02:10:56,481 --> 02:10:58,760
I'm just repeating what she said,
but it was just,

2097
02:10:58,761 --> 02:11:03,380
to me it was a hilarious and accurate.
A woman can say shit like that,

2098
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:08,270
but, uh, uh, a lady like current doesn't
look pat. A man calls her a boss bitch.

2099
02:11:08,271 --> 02:11:12,560
Like, hey, how some respect. It's
fucking Mitzi shore. But yeah.

2100
02:11:12,561 --> 02:11:16,970
So Taylor painted for me and hangs
over the studio watches over us,

2101
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:20,340
you know,
I genuinely don't think I ever met her.

2102
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:23,930
No, no. Yeah, I had some
great conversations with her.

2103
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:27,650
Yeah. When I came in that
first time, you know,

2104
02:11:27,651 --> 02:11:32,390
I was just standing out and I had no
idea what was going on. And, and then,

2105
02:11:32,391 --> 02:11:35,120
uh,
I really didn't come back to,

2106
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:37,790
cause I did a show in new port beach.

2107
02:11:37,791 --> 02:11:41,510
It's a laugh stop out there and just
got this horrifically horrible review.

2108
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:45,650
Did I tell this story last time?
It was so bad how bad

2109
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,670
it was. Joe, there was a picture of me,

2110
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:53,870
I'd only been saved with standup up
for my three and a half years and then,

2111
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:57,050
and so then the guy that booked that room,

2112
02:11:57,051 --> 02:12:02,051
watch me do it like an eight minute
set in Austin and I had a killer eight

2113
02:12:03,411 --> 02:12:07,860
minutes, but he hires me
to do 45 minutes. And uh,

2114
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:13,850
and so I go out there and I'm nervous
anyway, right? Because it's an,

2115
02:12:13,930 --> 02:12:16,030
that's a big club.
And,

2116
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:21,720
and the two guys before me were
a Seinfeld and slate and so,

2117
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:23,560
right. So, and then Ron wives,

2118
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:27,470
three and a half year old
booger eating moron thing and,

2119
02:12:28,130 --> 02:12:31,340
and uh, so, and, and at this point,

2120
02:12:31,341 --> 02:12:34,670
I don't realize how bad I am because
they haven't read it yet. And, uh,

2121
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:40,280
so before I'm nervous and they got to
go with it. That's Dunkin Strauss and,

2122
02:12:40,281 --> 02:12:42,580
uh,
and he writes a,

2123
02:12:42,730 --> 02:12:46,430
the comedy reviews for the Orange
County addition to the La Times,

2124
02:12:46,431 --> 02:12:50,810
which is about 6 million
people. And, uh, I like,

2125
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:51,943
Oh,

2126
02:12:55,310 --> 02:13:00,160
well I wish you'd given me a day
or two to settle in. And so, so

2127
02:13:02,290 --> 02:13:06,490
I do this, that, and it's
not great and it's a,

2128
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:10,610
but it's not bad. You know,
I think I pulled it off, you
know, they laughed at it,

2129
02:13:10,650 --> 02:13:13,880
you know, they laughed at what I had
put together and whatever it was,

2130
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:20,000
and I expected him to be there to
congratulate me on how good the uh,

2131
02:13:21,110 --> 02:13:25,760
set was and shake my hand and do a
little interview to build this great

2132
02:13:25,761 --> 02:13:29,860
interview. So, but he wasn't there
and I'm like, oh, okay, well then,

2133
02:13:29,861 --> 02:13:34,080
then next night there's like an a little
open mic night before me. So there's a,

2134
02:13:34,081 --> 02:13:38,820
in one of the guys, I know Steve Apps
from a, uh, Texas is on that. And,

2135
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:44,000
and then that night I fucking kill
and I'm really drunk and you know,

2136
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:49,920
and I'm giving advice to other
Comedians, you know, how,

2137
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:52,220
cause I made my ego's
just flare and I'm like,

2138
02:13:52,221 --> 02:13:55,370
I'm probably going to leave my wife and
go find that girl and lived to Cottey

2139
02:13:55,371 --> 02:13:59,360
beer posters and uh, they, you know,

2140
02:13:59,361 --> 02:14:02,930
it's amazing and the people are
patting me on the bag on here, man,

2141
02:14:02,931 --> 02:14:05,120
you are really, really
good. It is amazing.

2142
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:12,590
So I was staying at the Marriott
suites hotel on the bay,

2143
02:14:12,620 --> 02:14:15,700
which is Nice Hotel I've ever stayed in.
And uh,

2144
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:19,910
you had to pay for part of it yourself.
And, but that was all I had. I was making,

2145
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:22,010
I didn't matter,
never made that much money before.

2146
02:14:22,011 --> 02:14:26,550
He was like 14 or $1,500
and uh, for a week. And,

2147
02:14:27,130 --> 02:14:29,690
and uh, so it's, it's a,

2148
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:34,640
it's unbelievably beautiful with a
gorgeous view phone, bathroom, you know,

2149
02:14:34,641 --> 02:14:38,420
two bathroom, big marble,
everything, big nice stuff.

2150
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:43,040
And, uh, I go back after that. Well, the,

2151
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:48,050
now the review comes out the next
morning and I've got this massive hanger.

2152
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:52,390
I'm just so sick draw,
waking up, going out,

2153
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:57,170
he's a trust. And I says, I
blink my eyes and start going,

2154
02:14:57,800 --> 02:14:58,633
oh the review,

2155
02:14:59,030 --> 02:15:03,000
the glorious review was out there,

2156
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:07,260
the review that's going to be touting
my praises to the masses all over the,

2157
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:09,620
this area of southern California.

2158
02:15:10,430 --> 02:15:15,040
Probably the beginning
to my hugeness and uh,

2159
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:16,460
probably is what's going to happen.

2160
02:15:17,090 --> 02:15:22,090
So it turned out I had bought a bag of
popcorn when I was drunk and I followed

2161
02:15:24,981 --> 02:15:29,340
that bag,
that popcorn trail from my bed out the

2162
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:35,410
door, down the hall into the
elevator. The elevator I got on,

2163
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:38,860
had popcorn on it. So it was the same
one I came up and I was just drunk,

2164
02:15:38,861 --> 02:15:41,920
staggering around with a popcorn bag.
And I followed that.

2165
02:15:41,921 --> 02:15:46,030
Now this place is just right down
the block from the, from the club.

2166
02:15:46,570 --> 02:15:50,530
And when I go to, when I'm playing at
a club, I hang out at the club a lot.

2167
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:52,870
You know, cause that's, I just that
those are the people I know. Anyway,

2168
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:55,480
those have been my friends forever and
they're still my friends, you know,

2169
02:15:55,481 --> 02:15:57,640
I love some of these are
the people that work here.

2170
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:01,420
So I walk in the door and uh,

2171
02:16:01,421 --> 02:16:04,810
one of the girls that worked there and
looked at me and she goes, don't read it.

2172
02:16:06,290 --> 02:16:10,830
And I'm like, what? He goes, don't read
it wrong. It's not true. It isn't true.

2173
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:15,090
And a hatchet job. And
I'm like, it's a plot,

2174
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:20,610
a hatchet job. So I'm like, no,

2175
02:16:20,611 --> 02:16:24,480
give it to me. I, I can, I can read
it. Got, you know, how bad could it be?

2176
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:28,950
So
there's a big picture of me,

2177
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:33,690
this big 6 million people this big.
It was,

2178
02:16:33,730 --> 02:16:34,870
the article was this big,

2179
02:16:34,871 --> 02:16:38,470
it was a quarter of a page and
it said in big black print,

2180
02:16:38,530 --> 02:16:41,770
even when whites not blue,
he's not funny.

2181
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:44,980
And I dropped the newspaper on the floor.

2182
02:16:44,981 --> 02:16:49,840
I couldn't hold up a one ounce
newspaper because the life is in Biz,

2183
02:16:49,841 --> 02:16:50,800
sucked out of me.

2184
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:56,310
And I also agreed with them and felt
like I had just been found out as a phony

2185
02:16:57,730 --> 02:17:01,570
and I was a phony and I
didn't belong here at all.

2186
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:06,040
And uh,
and I picked it up and read it and uh,

2187
02:17:06,370 --> 02:17:09,640
and it said watch and
whites 41 minute show.

2188
02:17:09,641 --> 02:17:12,580
So they were nice enough to point
out. I didn't know, I just had to,

2189
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:16,900
I had to scrape it, crawl to get to
41 much less. The 45 I had agreed to,

2190
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:22,590
they pointed that out with
was like watching a polar
bear lumber around on stage

2191
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:28,150
and something comical or interesting
happening only occasionally.

2192
02:17:29,230 --> 02:17:33,730
Now here's why I'm,
I can quote that

2193
02:17:35,470 --> 02:17:37,330
all these 29 years later,

2194
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:43,330
I went across the street to the liquor
store and bought a bottle of Tequila and

2195
02:17:43,331 --> 02:17:45,850
a packer razorblades true story.

2196
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:48,460
I go back up to my Marriott.

2197
02:17:48,461 --> 02:17:52,270
So we told him the bay and a set,

2198
02:17:52,271 --> 02:17:55,180
they're this big desk and I'm
just drinking this Tequila,

2199
02:17:55,181 --> 02:17:57,970
reading it over and
over and over and over.

2200
02:17:58,510 --> 02:18:03,510
And I got a big bag of weed and I'm
smoking pot and I've convinced myself that

2201
02:18:03,941 --> 02:18:07,990
they're going to cancel the show
because who would come to a show,

2202
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:13,780
right. With a review like that. And,

2203
02:18:13,781 --> 02:18:16,000
uh, and then I'm thinking, well,

2204
02:18:16,001 --> 02:18:20,080
they probably have to pay me for
the shows I did even, you know,

2205
02:18:20,081 --> 02:18:23,710
even though I wasn't able to
finish the week, right. So I just,

2206
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:27,940
I just assume I'm fired a genuinely
believed that in my heart that I'm fired.

2207
02:18:28,810 --> 02:18:29,680
And,
uh,

2208
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:36,240
so I wake up from the stupor and I got a
drool stain on this fucking article and

2209
02:18:37,811 --> 02:18:40,810
a half a joint and a it,
I mean,

2210
02:18:40,811 --> 02:18:45,010
it's dismal shit, right?
It's dark, dark time.

2211
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:49,620
And I walked down there, fuck the
show sold out. Both of them are,

2212
02:18:49,621 --> 02:18:53,920
it's comedy in fucking
1990 [inaudible] 89 or 90,

2213
02:18:53,921 --> 02:18:56,540
whatever it was. And you know,
all the clubs were sold out.

2214
02:18:56,570 --> 02:19:00,990
Nobody gave a fuck about that
fucking review. And uh, they,

2215
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:05,320
they give a shit. And I, then I went
on stage because I was still a Raco.

2216
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:10,270
I'm drunk, I just woke up.
I'm not very good. Anyway,

2217
02:19:10,271 --> 02:19:12,250
I have no confidence whatsoever.

2218
02:19:12,251 --> 02:19:15,940
I totally agree that I suck and
I'm not worth a God damn thing.

2219
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:21,480
And I go up there and have the worst set
I've ever had a sold out house and it

2220
02:19:21,941 --> 02:19:26,320
was just sucked. It just sucked.
It was a horrible and uh,

2221
02:19:26,710 --> 02:19:27,980
and then the guy that booked

2222
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:30,590
me calls the club and
they go, he goes, yeah,

2223
02:19:30,591 --> 02:19:33,560
cause he read the fucking article and
he goes, that's kind of be a gut punch.

2224
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:38,390
I mean it was a long, there was other shit
in it too. And then it was good. And uh,

2225
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:42,970
so then that they get me on the
phone with him and then they get,

2226
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:45,530
cause they asked them, they said
we just want to see if he's okay.

2227
02:19:45,531 --> 02:19:49,310
And they're like, oh no, he's not
okay. He's not okay at all. I'm like,

2228
02:19:49,311 --> 02:19:52,330
I'm really now I'm now,
I'm calling my wife going,

2229
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:54,620
I just wanted to talk to you
cause I love you so much.

2230
02:19:55,090 --> 02:19:58,250
I'm thinking about the Ducati beer
poster anymore. I'm just calling her.

2231
02:19:59,330 --> 02:20:01,370
I just love you.
I want to be together forever.

2232
02:20:01,371 --> 02:20:03,880
And she's like kind of standoffish.
And I'm like, he's like,

2233
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:08,390
she could tell I had a bad review.
So that,

2234
02:20:08,391 --> 02:20:13,110
uh, that kind of scared me
away from La for awhile.

2235
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:15,530
And I realized then that they were riding,

2236
02:20:15,570 --> 02:20:18,080
I should've been slapped in the face
and I wasn't good enough to be on that

2237
02:20:18,081 --> 02:20:19,460
stage.
I was not.

2238
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:23,510
And that guy actually apologize to me
one time cause I was showing him later in

2239
02:20:23,511 --> 02:20:26,540
lab and I'm like, no dude, you were
totally right. You are completely right.

2240
02:20:26,541 --> 02:20:28,920
I should have been slapped in
the fucking fat three years in.

2241
02:20:28,930 --> 02:20:33,650
You're just getting, you know,
he had no business there. And uh,

2242
02:20:33,651 --> 02:20:36,500
and so, you know, and it all
worked out the, you know,

2243
02:20:36,501 --> 02:20:38,190
the best way it possibly
could have and that,

2244
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:42,800
but that also included a couple slaps in
the fucking face going, you're, you know,

2245
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:43,430
you're not,

2246
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:47,390
those are important. And I
really do. I think in the,
in the moment those feel bad,

2247
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:49,890
but every big leap I've made as a comic,

2248
02:20:49,891 --> 02:20:54,620
cause after I bombed every big
leap for real, like the, you know,

2249
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:56,850
someone telling me they had a bad time,
my show,

2250
02:20:56,851 --> 02:20:59,210
I just felt like you were off like,
fuck.

2251
02:20:59,810 --> 02:21:04,190
That feeling makes me so hungry
to figure out how to do it right.

2252
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:06,950
That's where it, where it comes
from. It makes you, you know,

2253
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:10,400
you realize there's an urgency to
this thing. And then over the years,

2254
02:21:10,610 --> 02:21:15,380
part of the fear of bombing is what
makes me work so hard on new shit.

2255
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:18,710
Front of the fears would
makes me do so many sets.

2256
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:23,090
I'll do two podcasts at night and then
I'll do four shows. I'll go to the store,

2257
02:21:23,091 --> 02:21:26,750
I'll do two at the show, a store,
I'll do one or two at the Improv.

2258
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:30,470
I might even go to the ice house
or the, Haha, I'll fuck around.

2259
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:35,270
These are all the reasons I'm not as good
as Joe Rogan right here. I get scared.

2260
02:21:35,271 --> 02:21:39,860
Ron White. I get scared. You know,
I do too. And I, you know, I, I,

2261
02:21:39,861 --> 02:21:44,300
well I can't, I can't tell you
it at 62. I do all those sets,

2262
02:21:44,301 --> 02:21:46,370
but I can do it. I do
it, go out and do sites,

2263
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:49,580
a lot of sets and a lot of guys
that are kind of in my, you know,

2264
02:21:49,581 --> 02:21:54,260
in my age group really don't come out
and do sets that much and I come out and

2265
02:21:54,261 --> 02:21:57,000
do SAS and I hang out.
You're ageless.

2266
02:21:57,630 --> 02:22:01,800
I think of you, you know, you said
that one time, uh, in the back room.

2267
02:22:01,801 --> 02:22:05,040
You like come older than you guys. And
we were like, we don't give a fuck.

2268
02:22:05,130 --> 02:22:09,750
That doesn't mean anything. This,
this, this, this thing is about comedy.

2269
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:14,340
It doesn't matter if you're a lesbian,
if you're trans,

2270
02:22:14,341 --> 02:22:17,220
if you're from Philadelphia
or the Philippines,

2271
02:22:17,550 --> 02:22:22,500
no one gives a fuck. Are
you funny? If you're funny,

2272
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:26,400
that's all we care about. We
don't care if you're 90, 19.

2273
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:30,540
I mean,
I'm fucking Kowski is,

2274
02:22:30,541 --> 02:22:34,530
what is she 22 or some shit? She might
be 22. She's one of my best friends.

2275
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:39,540
I love that girl. She's
got damn hilarious. She's
kid. We talk all the time.

2276
02:22:39,541 --> 02:22:43,500
We talked about comedy. I have her, she
hosted my sets, the Improv all the time.

2277
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:47,630
Nobody cares. Nobody cares about
your age. They care about comedy. He,

2278
02:22:47,631 --> 02:22:51,570
Dom Irrera is the same, same
way. You know, nobody thinks
of Donald Herrera is o.

2279
02:22:51,571 --> 02:22:55,170
Dot. Merera is older than us. No,
it's Dom Herrera is a God damn comic.

2280
02:22:55,890 --> 02:22:58,860
He's a monster.
This is a very,

2281
02:22:58,861 --> 02:23:03,150
very unusual group of humans. You really
think about the people that we know.

2282
02:23:03,151 --> 02:23:06,000
You know, if you looked at the
entire population of the planet,

2283
02:23:06,330 --> 02:23:10,470
there's 8 billion people or seven
and a half. Is that what it is?

2284
02:23:10,471 --> 02:23:12,900
Seven and a half something.
Some crazy shit.

2285
02:23:13,710 --> 02:23:16,690
How many of those are comics Zit?

2286
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:21,390
Is it a thousand couple thousand? The
real ones, how many of them are headlines?

2287
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:25,200
How many of them can do a solid hour?
How many of them were filmed a special?

2288
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:29,400
How many of you have two, three
specials? Jesus Christ, Ron White.

2289
02:23:29,850 --> 02:23:34,680
You and I are and we
weird waters really of us.

2290
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:39,750
Maybe 20 years, maybe
20 of us. Yeah, if that,

2291
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:42,900
yeah. We don't give a fuck how old you
are, dude. You better stick around.

2292
02:23:43,590 --> 02:23:45,030
I'm fine dude.
I'm fine.

2293
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:50,570
Hi. I'm drunk in the middle
of the afternoon when I got
work to do thanks to you.

2294
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:53,340
I had a, a friend of
mine, uh, when I was, uh,

2295
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:56,340
my daughter had that event in Vegas and
I went down to see you. They're like,

2296
02:23:56,341 --> 02:23:59,190
you're going to see a comic. I
go, don't go and see Ron White.

2297
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:02,580
Of course I'm going to go watch
him. I go, I have the chance.

2298
02:24:02,581 --> 02:24:06,660
What am I doing with my wife and watch
fucking to catch a Predator or some shit.

2299
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:09,550
I said, no, this is whatever.

2300
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:11,640
They're different watching
television or something like that.

2301
02:24:11,641 --> 02:24:15,300
I'm gonna go downstairs, watch Ron
wine. I'm at the Mirage. You know,

2302
02:24:15,930 --> 02:24:20,090
I still love it. Still love
watching it. Still love it today.

2303
02:24:20,530 --> 02:24:23,250
And it's, you know, it's
really, uh, it's such a

2304
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:28,860
hotbed. I get into it with the guys
at the seller in New York and uh,

2305
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:29,581
cause they're all like,

2306
02:24:29,581 --> 02:24:34,320
this is the most significant comedy
club and the in America. And I'm like,

2307
02:24:34,350 --> 02:24:36,390
it's the most significant hundred seater.

2308
02:24:37,650 --> 02:24:41,470
Yeah. The idea that that place is more
significant than the store is hilarious.

2309
02:24:41,980 --> 02:24:46,840
That's so silly and it's still fun
and I love, but it's all get silly,

2310
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:48,370
right? No. Yeah, that'd be ridiculous.

2311
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:53,590
No second place by a fucking large margin.
Right.

2312
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:57,220
Come on son. Dave Chappelle's up
at the fucking store all the time.

2313
02:24:57,221 --> 02:25:01,270
Chris rock comes by. Louis C K.
I'm sure he'll be back. All right.

2314
02:25:02,650 --> 02:25:05,250
It's a fucking crazy place,
but you're there.

2315
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:09,700
Delete is there Bryan County there?
Joey d is there.

2316
02:25:10,470 --> 02:25:12,250
It's chilly out one night.
And they were,

2317
02:25:12,910 --> 02:25:16,780
I think it was eight people in the show
that make at least 50,000 every time

2318
02:25:16,781 --> 02:25:21,580
they opened their mouth and a seat or
in one fucking show for $14,000 come to

2319
02:25:21,581 --> 02:25:25,090
the fucking store crazy and watch a show.

2320
02:25:25,091 --> 02:25:26,940
You know it's not,

2321
02:25:27,150 --> 02:25:31,030
and if you come like on a a weekend,

2322
02:25:31,031 --> 02:25:34,990
it's not as quite as strong because
a lot of the guys are out again,

2323
02:25:34,991 --> 02:25:38,650
girls or got dope doing set
somewhere. But, but Tuesday,

2324
02:25:38,651 --> 02:25:42,590
Wednesday, Thursday, the
best time it's the, you know,

2325
02:25:42,610 --> 02:25:45,880
there's nothing like it because we all
have to do what we're doing and we're

2326
02:25:45,881 --> 02:25:47,680
lucky to be able to do it where we do it

2327
02:25:47,820 --> 02:25:52,770
do one night, the lineup
was Tom Segura, Bill Burr,

2328
02:25:52,980 --> 02:25:57,810
Bert Kreischer, Allie won me, Joey Diaz.

2329
02:25:57,811 --> 02:26:01,700
Crystally uh,
Tom Papa Ian had,

2330
02:26:01,710 --> 02:26:04,950
it was fucking crazy.
It's crazy all the time.

2331
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:08,400
By the time you got to the end of the
line up, you're like the home alone kid.

2332
02:26:08,401 --> 02:26:12,240
Like, what the fuck? Look at
this lineup. This lineups insane.

2333
02:26:12,290 --> 02:26:17,280
It is. It is. And it's also what makes
it so fucking fun for me and watch,

2334
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:20,220
you know, it, you know, I, I got,

2335
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:24,830
I got to live in Beverly Hills and
I live two miles away and, and uh,

2336
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:28,760
and it, and that's what gets
me off the couch to go, uh,

2337
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:30,960
to go live my life and blow the horn

2338
02:26:31,410 --> 02:26:34,890
battery that plays a battery. We're
doing a lot of shows. The improv though,

2339
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:38,220
I'm doing two this week. I did two
last week. I'm doing them all the time.

2340
02:26:38,221 --> 02:26:39,780
What I did. I talked to
them about, I'm like,

2341
02:26:39,810 --> 02:26:43,440
how about I just bring some of my friends
over because like we could all do shit

2342
02:26:43,441 --> 02:26:43,860
like,

2343
02:26:43,860 --> 02:26:47,280
like Santina we'll do a set at the Improv
and then we'll shoot over to the store

2344
02:26:47,281 --> 02:26:47,911
and do his set.

2345
02:26:47,911 --> 02:26:51,420
I'll do an eight o'clock show store
doesn't open till later on weeknights CZ.

2346
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:55,720
So we've been doing a lot of shows down
there to the Improv is a great club man.

2347
02:26:55,721 --> 02:26:59,280
It just, the lineups were weird.
The way it was set up was weird.

2348
02:26:59,281 --> 02:27:00,660
There was a lot of weird shit going on,

2349
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:04,500
but if you could just get the top
notch people and I was talking to them,

2350
02:27:04,501 --> 02:27:08,910
I'm like click, we're right over there
with fucking, we could walk here.

2351
02:27:08,911 --> 02:27:11,530
It's a mile away. But you
know, I mean it's a mile.

2352
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:16,060
Nice. I love the Improv. But you know, if
you want to smoke a joint at the Improv,

2353
02:27:16,061 --> 02:27:21,061
you have to actually stand on Melrose
and traffic and smoke your weed and that

2354
02:27:21,101 --> 02:27:22,780
ain't cool.
And they're trying to change that.

2355
02:27:22,781 --> 02:27:24,940
I believe they're going to change that.
I believe they're looking at that.

2356
02:27:25,330 --> 02:27:28,240
Trying to make that they're building that
area on top where there's going to be

2357
02:27:28,241 --> 02:27:33,160
a little balcony out on the roof of
the part of it and, and it helped.

2358
02:27:33,161 --> 02:27:35,170
They do.
And if they do it will make a difference.

2359
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:38,420
It will make a big difference. Yeah.
Will the hangs not that good there.

2360
02:27:38,421 --> 02:27:40,880
It's hard and when you wait and you
go on stage, you're essentially in.

2361
02:27:40,881 --> 02:27:43,010
That's why.
That's why Bud Freeman was going wrong.

2362
02:27:43,011 --> 02:27:44,000
Could you just stand over there?

2363
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:53,660
Mitzi shore was literally like you guys
saw them out. Everybody sorted out.

2364
02:27:53,661 --> 02:27:58,310
Sorry it out. She didn't give a fuck
man. She understood. Keep everybody safe.

2365
02:27:58,370 --> 02:28:02,300
Let the lunatics running the
asylum. Yeah, and they did.

2366
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:05,720
I'll never forget the day she
passed me ever in my life.

2367
02:28:06,710 --> 02:28:10,460
You're really finding all right,
you're going to pay regular now.

2368
02:28:10,550 --> 02:28:15,020
I was like Holy Shit. Now explain
to people what a paid regular is.

2369
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:18,710
Cause I don't know. Well it's like you
made that you got the stamp of approval.

2370
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:22,100
You might actually have a career. Like
I wasn't if I was going to have a career

2371
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,770
in comedy. What's hilarious is
I was on a sitcom at the time.

2372
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:28,040
I was out here and do a television
show for Fox. I had done,

2373
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:30,920
I had been on showtime.
I already done,

2374
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:34,820
I'd headlined a lot of clubs all over
the country, probably prematurely.

2375
02:28:34,821 --> 02:28:38,450
I'd really only been doing
standup for six years,

2376
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:43,070
but uh, you know, I had maybe
a good 10, 15 minutes I could,

2377
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:46,970
I could actually do a real
solid half hour if I had to,

2378
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:50,480
but 15 minutes that I could
really kill with and uh,

2379
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:54,830
did to be able to do a set in front of
her. And she goes, you're a paid regular.

2380
02:28:54,831 --> 02:28:58,260
I was like, I'm a fucking
comedian. I'm a holy

2381
02:28:58,350 --> 02:29:02,530
shit. You've, you've been given the
nod. I thought it was a fair trade man.

2382
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:05,840
I thought it was a fraud. Even when I
was saying that, even when she said,

2383
02:29:05,841 --> 02:29:08,130
I was like, damn, I
tricked her. I tricked,

2384
02:29:08,131 --> 02:29:11,360
tells people in the audience I
tricked her. That's how I felt.

2385
02:29:11,361 --> 02:29:13,790
I felt like a tractor.
Fuck a trick to everybody.

2386
02:29:14,150 --> 02:29:15,860
But everybody treats
everybody in the beginning.

2387
02:29:16,510 --> 02:29:18,790
The beginning is the beginning of one guy.

2388
02:29:20,530 --> 02:29:25,030
But it's good that you didn't trick
them hard hits there important important

2389
02:29:25,031 --> 02:29:28,130
stuff.
Eating Shit on stage is critical.

2390
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:31,730
If you can't accept the
fact that it's a process,

2391
02:29:31,790 --> 02:29:33,950
you can't want to everything
to happen right away.

2392
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:38,300
And the only way for you to be really
sure that it's not happening yet is to

2393
02:29:38,301 --> 02:29:41,840
bomb, right? Yeah.
There's no other nothing,

2394
02:29:42,190 --> 02:29:45,860
nothing tells you so succinctly
that you're doing it wrong.

2395
02:29:45,861 --> 02:29:47,570
Like eating shit on stage.

2396
02:29:47,700 --> 02:29:52,680
Right. And you kind of learned a lot
from it. I mean, as you go, you know,

2397
02:29:52,681 --> 02:29:56,060
and that, you know, you don't really mess
around that much with comedies, venue.

2398
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:59,470
You don't want to play a football
stadium or whatever. Right.

2399
02:29:59,790 --> 02:30:03,180
What's the biggest place you've
ever performed at a well,

2400
02:30:03,181 --> 02:30:07,660
blue collar comedy tour? We
held the uh, the record, uh,

2401
02:30:07,950 --> 02:30:12,950
where the predators play hockey
and a in Nashville and a 20,000.

2402
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:20,010
That's a lot of sampling. And Elton
John held the record before we broke it.

2403
02:30:20,011 --> 02:30:23,550
And the reason we broke it as we were
in a center stage in the middle and

2404
02:30:23,551 --> 02:30:25,400
there's only four of us doing standup,
so it was,

2405
02:30:25,820 --> 02:30:30,450
nobody will ever have a smaller stage.
Wow. For that show there. Right.

2406
02:30:30,510 --> 02:30:34,560
How could they, and that was right
before we film blue collar. One two done.

2407
02:30:34,660 --> 02:30:37,750
Josh Wolfe showed me a picture when
you opened up for Larry, the cable guy,

2408
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:39,610
you will opened up and
some football arena.

2409
02:30:40,420 --> 02:30:43,720
He's on stage and he takes it like a
selfie out. Looking at the audience.

2410
02:30:43,721 --> 02:30:47,050
It's the craziest thing you've ever
seen your life. See if he could find it.

2411
02:30:47,410 --> 02:30:52,000
Josh Wolfe, uh, opening up for
Larry, the cable guy. Selfie.

2412
02:30:52,001 --> 02:30:55,060
It's fun. I don't even know if he put it
online. He showed it to me on his phone.

2413
02:30:55,450 --> 02:31:00,040
It's fucking bananas. There's
50,000 people there, you know,

2414
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:00,800
50,000.

2415
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:04,910
Oh yeah. He was doing, he's doing crazy,
crazy, crazy numbers and number. Yep.

2416
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,490
Like, and didn't even
talk about it. You know,

2417
02:31:07,491 --> 02:31:10,580
there was a lot of people that are hating
on him. He couldn't be a nicer guy.

2418
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:15,420
He's also a great pace, rhythm
and timing. One land or guys,

2419
02:31:15,510 --> 02:31:20,100
you know it. And uh, as good as it
gets, I've seen him just crowds to

2420
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:24,760
death. Funny Dude and uh, and gifted
and also has done it. You know,

2421
02:31:24,770 --> 02:31:26,690
he's totally paid his dues.
You know,

2422
02:31:26,691 --> 02:31:31,620
how many percent did I met him in 92.
I see you've done him longer.

2423
02:31:31,621 --> 02:31:34,970
Nine. Holy Shit. Look at
that fucking right. Yeah.

2424
02:31:35,460 --> 02:31:36,750
I haven't played this place.

2425
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:38,520
Look at that fucking,

2426
02:31:38,950 --> 02:31:43,030
that's gotta be, that's gotta be
in Nebraska, right? So, right.

2427
02:31:43,031 --> 02:31:47,170
Everybody's be Lincoln, Nebraska.

2428
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:50,320
That is one of the most insane
crowds I've ever seen in my life.

2429
02:31:50,680 --> 02:31:55,570
But it makes sense. He's got great
fucking timing, man. And I met him,

2430
02:31:55,630 --> 02:31:59,420
like I said, in 92 I think at the, um,

2431
02:31:59,770 --> 02:32:04,570
comedy works in Montreal when
Jimbo used to run the joint and a,

2432
02:32:04,600 --> 02:32:07,260
he was a great guy, man back
then. Even back then he was a,

2433
02:32:07,510 --> 02:32:11,680
I think he was a radio personality
in Florida at the time. You know,

2434
02:32:11,681 --> 02:32:15,730
he's just [inaudible] the cable guy was
a character he did in that and that he

2435
02:32:15,731 --> 02:32:19,470
would bring it into a show for one
joke and then it kind of just took over

2436
02:32:19,490 --> 02:32:22,780
fucking crazy. And people don't
know, like he's Dan Whitney.

2437
02:32:22,810 --> 02:32:26,530
It's like a regular person, regular
comics. He's trapped. Right?

2438
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:29,680
He is Larry the cable traffic, the
place you'd like to be trapped. Right.

2439
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:33,070
The place where you're
making $30 million a year.

2440
02:32:33,330 --> 02:32:36,580
But it's like this marvelous
Mrs Maizel thing. Except he's,

2441
02:32:36,610 --> 02:32:37,890
that's who he actually is.
I mean,

2442
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:40,850
he doesn't have to wear a
fat suit or anything crazy,
but, well there's, you know,

2443
02:32:40,870 --> 02:32:45,250
his dad was a preacher and a
pig farmer from Nebraska. Wow.

2444
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:46,480
And uh,

2445
02:32:46,570 --> 02:32:51,570
and so he does this a great auctioneer
voice where the lawyer has sold a little

2446
02:32:51,791 --> 02:32:54,130
Danny Whitney from across the street.
Wow.

2447
02:32:55,390 --> 02:33:00,310
A preacher in a pig farmer.
Holy Shit. Speaking of pigs,

2448
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:01,660
the pigs just keep coming back.

2449
02:33:01,700 --> 02:33:04,920
Yeah.
The

2450
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:07,650
thing is you can't save the pigs.
You got to kill some of them.

2451
02:33:07,990 --> 02:33:12,990
You know what the ultimate conundrum
because like it would be nice if we could

2452
02:33:14,731 --> 02:33:19,731
have like some sort of a
harmony with nature with pigs,

2453
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:22,620
but that's not possible.
If they're wild,

2454
02:33:22,830 --> 02:33:24,710
they're fucking up a storm to have in two,

2455
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:28,530
three litters a year with six to eight
little piglets and they're just running

2456
02:33:28,531 --> 02:33:32,640
rampant and there they come. Viable.
I think, correct me if I'm wrong,

2457
02:33:32,970 --> 02:33:37,240
I think female pigs become viable and
you get pregnant after four months.

2458
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:40,080
You're exactly right. That's why
they make these little bitty pig.

2459
02:33:40,590 --> 02:33:42,360
And they have these little bitty pigs too.

2460
02:33:42,361 --> 02:33:46,020
And they're the cutest things I've ever
seen in my life. Oh, they're adorable.

2461
02:33:46,170 --> 02:33:50,100
And I said, can I pick one up? And they're
like, they squeal like a pig, you know?

2462
02:33:50,110 --> 02:33:53,040
And literally I picked one up
and they like, they made a noise,

2463
02:33:53,041 --> 02:33:57,840
like I was stabbing a screwdriver into
their ear. And I'm like, oh, okay.

2464
02:33:57,841 --> 02:34:01,770
All right. Well they're
smart. They get scared.

2465
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:05,790
They're smart. It's so it's a crazy
thing because like you want to love them,

2466
02:34:06,270 --> 02:34:08,490
but then if they're taking
over your neighborhood,

2467
02:34:08,550 --> 02:34:12,060
you want to fucking shoot him and kill
him and they're delicious and they're

2468
02:34:12,090 --> 02:34:16,890
delicious. That's their problem.
Right? That's the whole problem.

2469
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:17,980
They're delicious.

2470
02:34:18,020 --> 02:34:22,750
You know how they got into California?
No. William Randolph Hearst. Oh yeah.

2471
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:23,890
That crazy asshole.

2472
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:28,920
He's to bring him and he would populate
his forest outside of his home with wild

2473
02:34:29,171 --> 02:34:31,480
pigs have been wild boars.

2474
02:34:31,650 --> 02:34:36,650
Boys go out and fucking shoot them like
so if you go to like tach a pea or any

2475
02:34:36,851 --> 02:34:38,330
of these areas that have wild pigs,

2476
02:34:38,331 --> 02:34:41,860
so you'd go to certain areas like
towards the middle of near Bakersfield.

2477
02:34:41,950 --> 02:34:45,790
There's wild pigs out there. That's
all. William Randolph Hearst. Wild pigs.

2478
02:34:45,791 --> 02:34:49,720
Thanks bill. Yeah, that crazy ass
hall. He let pigs loose in California.

2479
02:34:49,721 --> 02:34:50,111
They were everywhere.

2480
02:34:50,111 --> 02:34:55,111
Big Sur like hunter s Thompson used to
hunt wild boar in big Sur with a fucking

2481
02:34:55,181 --> 02:34:56,014
machine gun.

2482
02:34:56,200 --> 02:35:01,200
Those were William Randolph Hearst wild
pigs that had populated all the way up

2483
02:35:01,811 --> 02:35:03,940
the coast all the way up to San Jose.

2484
02:35:04,050 --> 02:35:07,450
There was a fucking news story from
San Jose where they were knocking over

2485
02:35:07,451 --> 02:35:11,680
people's trash cans and he's like a huge
tech community's a hundred pound pigs

2486
02:35:13,940 --> 02:35:17,620
knowing people most enter me wild ones
aren't that big. The wild ones too,

2487
02:35:17,621 --> 02:35:21,000
like a big wild once,
like 300 pounds, the big,

2488
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:24,590
really big honor one daughter,
Madison, Georgia. They're there.

2489
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:26,230
You know what happens there though?

2490
02:35:26,231 --> 02:35:29,800
They're domesticated and then people let
them go. See, don't want to look at this.

2491
02:35:29,801 --> 02:35:33,310
I bought the computer. Don't fuck up
my fucking story. Truth. No, no, no.

2492
02:35:33,311 --> 02:35:36,370
I know about this.
One thing I do know about is feral pigs.

2493
02:35:36,371 --> 02:35:38,180
I've studied them pretty,
pretty closely. Why?

2494
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:42,700
Because I'm friends with a lot of people
that are professional hunters and uh,

2495
02:35:42,730 --> 02:35:45,880
I wanted to know how the fuck they
got so big. Like there's a video of a,

2496
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:49,600
there's a photo rather one they called
Hogzilla. That was from Georgia.

2497
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:53,440
It's a fucking enormous pig.
But it looks,

2498
02:35:54,770 --> 02:35:55,750
look at that motherfucker.

2499
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:59,800
King Kong hog from Russia makes
Hogzilla looked like a baby. See,

2500
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:03,530
I'm not buying that.
What does that guy look at the guy's head?

2501
02:36:03,530 --> 02:36:07,420
See that guy's head. That guy's a
mile away. Where the fuck is that guy?

2502
02:36:07,630 --> 02:36:10,910
That guy could be on top of that thing
and that look looks like a German chap.

2503
02:36:10,940 --> 02:36:14,080
How much this away? We have no idea.
This is a photograph. Oh, hold on.

2504
02:36:14,260 --> 02:36:18,430
Let me see that Tusk. CN. Let me
see the tusks. Eh, it's a big pig,

2505
02:36:18,670 --> 02:36:22,030
but it doesn't have to be that big
that that could be a 300 400 pound big.

2506
02:36:22,150 --> 02:36:26,810
It doesn't even say, did they
weigh it? 1,175 pounds to bigger.

2507
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:31,480
Whoa.
These guys with the scales,

2508
02:36:32,030 --> 02:36:36,310
what website is this? We've got scales.
Website is, it's wide open spaces.

2509
02:36:36,350 --> 02:36:40,510
Hmm. That's a pretty reputable
that not all shoulder.

2510
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:45,930
Yeah. Five and a half feet
at the shoulder. Christ.

2511
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:49,870
Honestly, picture he brought 200 of
these. Not specifically that one,

2512
02:36:49,871 --> 02:36:53,920
but it was a Russian boar he brought
in from Russia and they've ended up

2513
02:36:53,921 --> 02:36:57,730
breeding with local feral pigs
and they got big. Yeah. Well,

2514
02:36:57,731 --> 02:37:00,730
here's the thing about bores
and pigs and all that jazz.

2515
02:37:00,731 --> 02:37:04,750
It all comes from the same genus. It's
all from something called sue [inaudible].

2516
02:37:05,030 --> 02:37:06,640
Sue scruff is all pigs.

2517
02:37:06,641 --> 02:37:09,910
What's crazy about that is like when
you see a domestic pig and they look all

2518
02:37:09,911 --> 02:37:11,500
cute and cuddly and pink and chant.

2519
02:37:11,890 --> 02:37:14,380
When they get loose and they
go wandering through the woods,

2520
02:37:14,381 --> 02:37:16,010
they turned and their

2521
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:20,390
face changes. Their face gets longer.
The Grote tusks, their hair gets thicker.

2522
02:37:20,420 --> 02:37:22,340
This one,
it says the shoulder height.

2523
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:25,460
Is that how high the shoulders are off
the ground? Right at five and a half feet.

2524
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:30,320
Trice that's so big. That's all. I'm
three inches shorter or taller than that.

2525
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:34,130
The five and a half feet. That's
insane. That's this tall on me.

2526
02:37:34,310 --> 02:37:38,330
So me standing out. Okay, I'm five, eight.
Look at this. Watch this. Here's the pigs.

2527
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:43,410
Here's the pig shoulder, right?
Right. That's all honoree.

2528
02:37:44,250 --> 02:37:46,820
Where's three inches? Like right
here? That's fucking insane.

2529
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,960
That's a pig that high. That's
insane. That's an elk. Hogs,

2530
02:37:52,140 --> 02:37:56,030
hogs. Hogzilla was a shoulder height
of three feet, so that's almost double

2531
02:37:58,130 --> 02:38:01,790
five and a half feet tall.
That's so big.

2532
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:04,960
But if it was a thousand pounds,
that makes sense. Cause, uh,

2533
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:07,730
a good elk is like 800 pounds.

2534
02:38:09,190 --> 02:38:13,310
A longhorn steers are so far behind it.
[inaudible]

2535
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,050
hunter's trick, right? So Hunter's trait,
that's what's drawn. It's back here.

2536
02:38:18,051 --> 02:38:21,920
I don't see his hands. You see his hands?
I don't see you say, trust me, look at it.

2537
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:26,210
Listen that guys in the next [inaudible]
next area code. That guy's hiding.

2538
02:38:26,540 --> 02:38:29,360
He's way behind that thing.
You're supposed to be right next to it.

2539
02:38:29,530 --> 02:38:33,080
If that is a deceptive photo.
When you take a photo like that,

2540
02:38:33,081 --> 02:38:35,990
that is you doing that on purpose,
what you're supposed to do,

2541
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:40,520
he's supposed to put your
gun or your rifle or you're,
or you're a bow and arrow.

2542
02:38:40,730 --> 02:38:42,050
You lead on the animal.

2543
02:38:42,051 --> 02:38:46,310
You stand next to it so that people that
know how difficult it is and people say,

2544
02:38:46,311 --> 02:38:49,730
Oh, you're trophy a hundred
now you trying to kill a smart,

2545
02:38:49,731 --> 02:38:53,780
mature animal because that's the one
that's healthiest for the population.

2546
02:38:53,930 --> 02:38:56,270
That's the one you want to
take out of the breeding cycle.

2547
02:38:56,450 --> 02:38:57,560
This is one that's already spread.

2548
02:38:57,561 --> 02:39:02,360
It's jeans and hunter's respect when
someone shoots a mature older animal.

2549
02:39:02,361 --> 02:39:06,000
That's a for sure. It looks
good, right? I'm hungry.

2550
02:39:06,170 --> 02:39:08,930
Those are not that good to eat unless you
really know what the fuck you're doing.

2551
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:12,290
Like you gotta be to slow
cook that motherfucker.

2552
02:39:13,490 --> 02:39:17,910
That one you want to do low.
You want to probably Brian,

2553
02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:18,883
that bitch,

2554
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:24,040
get them in a big old Vada saltwater
with brown sugar and garlic and let them

2555
02:39:24,381 --> 02:39:28,190
soak for awhile. This article is sort
of saying it could be bullshit bullshit.

2556
02:39:28,191 --> 02:39:31,040
I'm telling you, that guy's too far
away. You've got to listen to me.

2557
02:39:31,290 --> 02:39:34,430
For us to see a guy that's that far away.
What are you saying to her Russians,

2558
02:39:34,431 --> 02:39:37,970
Bro. It's that guys near the
bumper. That's a hockey car.

2559
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:40,490
Look where his shoulders are.

2560
02:39:40,491 --> 02:39:44,210
They line up almost with the bumper
that you guys know Alex tiny.

2561
02:39:44,270 --> 02:39:48,620
He's way behind that pig in
relation to the size of the car.

2562
02:39:48,650 --> 02:39:52,160
Exactly. It was like a third grader.
Exactly. It doesn't make sense.

2563
02:39:52,610 --> 02:39:56,120
This guy is hiding.
He's hiding behind that pig.

2564
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:58,880
If you wanted people to
know the actual perspective,

2565
02:39:58,881 --> 02:40:02,840
you'd say that if he had a rifle leaning
up against that pig and the rifle look

2566
02:40:02,841 --> 02:40:05,740
tiny, you'd be like, Holy
Shit, that's a giant pig. Yeah,

2567
02:40:05,870 --> 02:40:09,830
but there's nothing in that photo
that represents an actual perspective.

2568
02:40:09,890 --> 02:40:12,530
You'd have to be standing right, like
he's hiding. He's he. He was so old.

2569
02:40:12,531 --> 02:40:16,590
We can't and see bitch. You could see
that in a five and a half foot tall pig.

2570
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:21,960
Well that pig six one laying down in
this picture. Yeah, in the picture.

2571
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:25,050
These are some, his niece is the
only evidence they have dead one.

2572
02:40:25,051 --> 02:40:27,170
That means that the wearable,
if we have in the lobby,

2573
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:30,570
could be real to the world was a thousand
pounds. It's even bigger than this pig.

2574
02:40:30,810 --> 02:40:34,590
Yeah, that's stupid. That's what people
do, man. People take pictures of animals.

2575
02:40:34,591 --> 02:40:38,130
They hide in the hunting world
is called the grip and grin.

2576
02:40:38,610 --> 02:40:41,580
Take a photo like a hold a deer
and you'll look, push them way out.

2577
02:40:41,581 --> 02:40:42,780
People do that with fish too.

2578
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:45,570
Like you caught a big bass
and you take that big bass.

2579
02:40:45,571 --> 02:40:48,060
You put it way in front of
you, it looks gigantic, right?

2580
02:40:48,061 --> 02:40:51,220
If you take that big basket like,
Hey, look at my big bass, right?

2581
02:40:51,390 --> 02:40:52,590
That's a confident person.

2582
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:56,270
Confident person got that basket
behind them or that motherfucker.

2583
02:40:56,330 --> 02:41:00,390
Do you know how big it is? Wrong,
bigger, wrong. Keep guessing.

2584
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:02,220
Doesn't matter if this guy's a liar.

2585
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:06,300
The guy in withholding it out in
front of him, he's showboating.

2586
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:09,510
I'm not buying it. That
fucking pigs. 300 pounds.

2587
02:41:09,511 --> 02:41:13,710
That's a baby pig or against
it. Whitney Cummings, pigs,

2588
02:41:13,711 --> 02:41:16,440
brothers and sisters got loose.
They shot it.

2589
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:19,760
So I saw her right after that.
I thought I told you, it's like,

2590
02:41:19,761 --> 02:41:24,680
you're not going to believe this shit,
Whitney. I have pictures of your pig.

2591
02:41:24,710 --> 02:41:27,380
You know, show it to her on the phone
and she just flipped the fuck out.

2592
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:32,080
Ah, yeah, she's a, that
lady loves animals for real.

2593
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:35,560
She's who?
God bless her fiance.

2594
02:41:36,010 --> 02:41:39,520
He's in for a a long
run of animal husbandry.

2595
02:41:41,010 --> 02:41:43,370
My friend's wife,
she sees

2596
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:48,730
an animal this dead and
it's a winter subarea.

2597
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:51,470
She'll put it in her freezer.
Oh God.

2598
02:41:52,650 --> 02:41:56,580
Wafer-Thin and Berea and wait for
the ground to thaw and then dig all

2599
02:41:56,610 --> 02:41:59,510
embarrassed. Jesus. That's
deep. Whitney wouldn't do that.

2600
02:42:01,750 --> 02:42:05,610
Sticks to the next level. This lady. Yeah,

2601
02:42:05,611 --> 02:42:08,670
that's taken it to the next level. You've
got to accept this is a cycle of life.

2602
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:11,880
You don't have to like just leave it
outside for something to eat. Yeah.

2603
02:42:11,940 --> 02:42:15,180
That's what you're supposed to do. What I
do. Well, it's, there's a reason for that.

2604
02:42:15,181 --> 02:42:18,960
Those animals, they need to stay alive
to the animals that eat dead animals.

2605
02:42:18,990 --> 02:42:22,430
They need to stay alive too. Right?
This is the whole cycle. Well,

2606
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:25,540
not just vultures. Rats, you
know, there's a lot of, uh,

2607
02:42:25,710 --> 02:42:27,290
and a lot of lower Chavez's cabin.

2608
02:42:27,380 --> 02:42:29,870
Interesting is this show
gets Drucker and Drucker.

2609
02:42:30,950 --> 02:42:35,950
I grow Meyer Lemons at my place and so
I look at the lemons and something is

2610
02:42:39,201 --> 02:42:43,790
eating the rind off the lemon and
left the lemon hanging on the tree.

2611
02:42:44,750 --> 02:42:49,430
PERF in perfect condition. And
A, I'm like, well that's odd.

2612
02:42:50,030 --> 02:42:54,950
And then I see a one little group of
perfectly peeled lemons on the ground and

2613
02:42:54,951 --> 02:42:59,090
then there's two more
lemon pods on the tree.

2614
02:42:59,240 --> 02:43:03,170
Perfectly Lemons. No rat. And I'm like,

2615
02:43:03,171 --> 02:43:07,910
what the fuck is this? This is yesterday.
This is how this aspect yesterday,

2616
02:43:08,320 --> 02:43:11,980
this hidden memories from the
past, which I have almost none. No,

2617
02:43:12,730 --> 02:43:14,800
but yesterday and uh,

2618
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:18,400
so we looked it up and
it's called a roof rat.

2619
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:20,090
And they love it.

2620
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:24,370
They love specifically Meyer Lemons,

2621
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:27,760
which is what these were.
And they love the, the ride,

2622
02:43:27,761 --> 02:43:30,970
but they don't like the sourness
of the, uh, of the fruit.

2623
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,600
So they just eat the,
uh,

2624
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:39,670
they just eat the rind and leave the
fruit hanging on the tree. And it's,

2625
02:43:40,540 --> 02:43:43,090
it was just baffling
really when I first saw it,

2626
02:43:43,091 --> 02:43:47,860
but that they do the exact opposite with
oranges. And we also have blood oranges.

2627
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:49,960
And so they'll put a little hole in a,

2628
02:43:49,961 --> 02:43:53,140
meet all the fruit out of and leave the
husk hanging on the tree was not on the

2629
02:43:53,141 --> 02:43:57,100
inside. I'm like, Jesus
Christ fucking dicks.

2630
02:43:57,140 --> 02:43:59,920
So now when I eat an orange or
a lamb or whatever, I'm like,

2631
02:43:59,950 --> 02:44:03,280
throw the rides out there,
saved the fucking fruit. You
know, I really don't lie.

2632
02:44:03,310 --> 02:44:06,910
I don't like to kill anything. I
have a peach tree. I may be eight,

2633
02:44:06,911 --> 02:44:09,880
three peaches the whole time I've
been living in this fucking house.

2634
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:14,350
I been living in that house. It's 2003.
These God damn squirrels eat my peaches.

2635
02:44:14,351 --> 02:44:17,980
Right? They eat every fucking peach
I've ever grown. Look at that.

2636
02:44:18,010 --> 02:44:21,040
Look at these rats. Look at,
well that's what's left there.

2637
02:44:21,100 --> 02:44:22,930
They dug a hole in that shit.

2638
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:26,760
I literally never get
to eat peaches all day.

2639
02:44:26,860 --> 02:44:29,530
All have all these things
going on in my house right now.

2640
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:34,510
They're called roof rat.
I got serious coyote problems.

2641
02:44:35,400 --> 02:44:40,400
I have no more chickens kind of out
of all my chickens in one fell swoop.

2642
02:44:41,081 --> 02:44:43,840
You ready for this?
They killed the last nine chickens.

2643
02:44:44,110 --> 02:44:49,030
I had to transfer to them them because
my chicken coop burnt to the ground.

2644
02:44:49,540 --> 02:44:53,820
So we had to get a smaller coop. And
you're blaming that on the Chi? No,

2645
02:44:54,660 --> 02:44:59,260
we, the chickens escaped and we saved the
chickens and we got them to this other

2646
02:44:59,261 --> 02:45:02,230
coop, um, after the fire. And uh,

2647
02:45:02,231 --> 02:45:05,740
it wasn't as reinforced as the
original coupe, the original coupe.

2648
02:45:05,741 --> 02:45:08,860
I had hired a guy who's a
carpenter to build me a nice coupe.

2649
02:45:09,270 --> 02:45:12,820
He did a great job and the coyotes were
on the roof one night chew and at it.

2650
02:45:12,821 --> 02:45:16,690
And I had a fucking,
I had a death perch set up on my porch.

2651
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:21,760
I had my whole weight out there. I
had arrows, range finder. I even had,

2652
02:45:22,020 --> 02:45:25,300
I even laid bait out in my yard waiting
for these [inaudible]. I was ready,

2653
02:45:25,301 --> 02:45:29,200
I was going to Rambo,
but I lost my patients and I'm a busy man.

2654
02:45:29,201 --> 02:45:33,780
I got a lot that's due. So I
abandoned the project. Fire,

2655
02:45:33,820 --> 02:45:35,950
burnt my fucking chicken
coop down to the ground.

2656
02:45:35,980 --> 02:45:40,980
We put these chickens and another coop
and these coyotes tour that coop apart

2657
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:46,780
and they did it when we weren't home.
And uh, we came home is just feathers.

2658
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:50,680
There were all gone. All nine of them
there, you know, part of me admires them,

2659
02:45:51,370 --> 02:45:51,641
you know,

2660
02:45:51,641 --> 02:45:55,120
part of me is like these little wolves
are surviving in the suburbs is trying to

2661
02:45:55,121 --> 02:45:57,200
figure this shit out.
Man.

2662
02:45:57,400 --> 02:46:00,220
They will break into this thing or die.

2663
02:46:00,430 --> 02:46:03,250
My wife was getting uncomfortable because
you're basically making your house at

2664
02:46:03,251 --> 02:46:06,520
target. You know they're on the
roof right next to the house.

2665
02:46:06,521 --> 02:46:09,890
These little small predators
or chewing the roof of that,

2666
02:46:09,950 --> 02:46:13,140
the chicken coop before the
fire happened and it was like a,

2667
02:46:13,170 --> 02:46:15,170
that was the one I decided to go to war.

2668
02:46:15,530 --> 02:46:18,470
I didn't fully committed to
war cause I didn't get a,

2669
02:46:18,471 --> 02:46:21,610
I was going to get a sub sonic 22.
That's the way to go. Cause it,

2670
02:46:21,611 --> 02:46:25,050
you were here a subsonic 22,
it sounds like says pack.

2671
02:46:25,550 --> 02:46:27,560
It doesn't sound like
anything but it's lethal.

2672
02:46:27,950 --> 02:46:32,120
I had a coyote but I don't think
it's legal inside city limits.

2673
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:34,010
Like I don't even think
I should be saying that.

2674
02:46:34,011 --> 02:46:38,220
I wanted to share it with them
with a rifle. It's probably like,

2675
02:46:38,510 --> 02:46:41,300
like a criminal intent idea.

2676
02:46:41,301 --> 02:46:43,850
But I never really considered it
and I definitely never bought one.

2677
02:46:44,060 --> 02:46:48,350
But I was ready to fuck one up with a
bow and arrow. But uh, now it's over.

2678
02:46:48,570 --> 02:46:50,900
They got, they won, they figured it out,

2679
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:53,780
the fire opened up the door and they um,

2680
02:46:53,870 --> 02:46:56,870
after the fire was they were real sketchy,

2681
02:46:57,030 --> 02:47:00,470
real loud and cause they were trying
to figure out what the fuck is going on

2682
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:01,850
because like all the,

2683
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:05,400
the brush was gone so probably the rabbits
were missing and the rats or mice of

2684
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:10,340
course there were, yeah, we're
going to say Jamie. Yeah, it was a,

2685
02:47:10,370 --> 02:47:14,900
it's weird. It came, you know, came home
and see just feathers everywhere man.

2686
02:47:14,901 --> 02:47:15,800
Just feathers.

2687
02:47:15,830 --> 02:47:20,570
Like just like someone just sliced a
few pillows and just shook them all over

2688
02:47:20,571 --> 02:47:23,840
the yard. Like fuck, you know,

2689
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:27,590
we should look back and try to figure
out what we should have closed with.

2690
02:47:27,830 --> 02:47:32,600
That's a good way to close cause with
murder chickens, we've got a show tonight.

2691
02:47:32,630 --> 02:47:36,980
Ron White will be with me. All shows
are sold out. I'll go in. Well show us.

2692
02:47:36,981 --> 02:47:38,420
Show sold out this weekend.

2693
02:47:38,421 --> 02:47:42,410
I met Austin Cap City comedy club that
sold the fuck out too with George Perez,

2694
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:44,000

Dammit. My place is under construction.
Emory doing my house. Why?

2697
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:55,560
Intercontinental Man of mystery.

2698
02:47:55,561 --> 02:47:59,360
He travels all over the globe homes
and many mysterious locations.

2699
02:47:59,510 --> 02:48:03,620
Don't you have a place in Atlanta too?
Uh, so that and bought the place and uh,

2700
02:48:04,040 --> 02:48:06,310
and awesome. I like it.
I like to move though.

2701
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:10,150
I like where you like to go to
my favorite spots in Austin too.

2702
02:48:10,770 --> 02:48:14,330
You can easily, whenever the five
response I could live in either or.

2703
02:48:14,810 --> 02:48:19,810
I need to get connected to the music
vibe in Austin and figure out real quick

2704
02:48:20,241 --> 02:48:25,160
who you really love to see and sure, sure.
But I don't like it. I like Atlanta too,

2705
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:28,520
and I love both of them. All right.
Ron White, you're a bad motherfucker.

2706
02:48:28,550 --> 02:48:31,220
It's an honor to call your trafficker.
I appreciate you dearly.

2707
02:48:31,430 --> 02:48:36,140
As you're back at your Holla. That's
it. Fuckers. We'll see you soon. Uh,

2708
02:48:36,170 --> 02:48:37,730

2709
02:48:49,270 --> 02:48:53,780
Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
