1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,520
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,660
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,810
It's so obviously her
Piper's terrified of snakes.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:08,911
Well,

5
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,080
if he wasn't before,

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,320
he pulled a gun on me one time over snake,

7
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:12,630
man.

8
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,020
Really?

9
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,530
Yeah.

10
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,130
What happened?

11
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,830
I snuck up behind him with a
snake and he fucking heard me.

12
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,151
She's Jagan went,

13
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:18,331
yeah.

14
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:18,630
He goes,

15
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,620
I know what you're fucking doing.

16
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,200
He don't.

17
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,170
He don't even get his fucking
pistol and pull around,

18
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,223
motherfucker.

19
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,851
I'll kill you.

20
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,031
I'm like,

21
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:24,301
okay.

22
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,020
Ready again.

23
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,853
When I get it.

24
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,920
The guy was shaking,

25
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:27,783
man.

26
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,233
That's a real thing.

27
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,001
Here's the story.

28
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:30,834
Here's the story.

29
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,360
I'm in the locker room behaving myself,

30
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,410
my Nigga soul,

31
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,900
I believe I was cleaning the wash cloth,

32
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,970
blackboards off and making them
nice for everybody and macho walks.

33
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:45,650
Anyway,

34
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,483
we're really,

35
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,020
it's the story fucking going around.

36
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:54,240
We're going to get done and do it.

37
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,530
Dude.

38
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,131
Sounds great,

39
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:56,964
and he's like,

40
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,780
we to take care of a
little business Merced

41
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,050
who built this sneak.

42
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,383
Yeah.

43
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,550
Has He been fixture?

44
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,310
Not Fixed.

45
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,760
You mean poisonous?

46
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,540
He goes,

47
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:12,871
yeah,

48
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,410
that might be the fucking bro.

49
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,660
I'm like,

50
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,051
Randy,

51
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:17,070
of course he's been fixed.

52
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,880
He goes,

53
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,450
maybe as in maybe Hess,

54
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,250
stranger things have happened in the WWE.

55
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,230
Somebody wants to macho man,

56
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,000

57
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:30,820

61
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:40,981
I'm like,

62
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:41,430

63
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,870

64
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,370
I'm just telling you this.

65
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,300
He has to blink you now.

66
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,010
Wow.

67
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,550
I'm like,

68
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,060
what?

69
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,110
He goes it,

70
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,970
but we got to go at it right now.

71
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:54,391
Me and you.

72
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,940
And he's up in my fucking face
with his fist and I'm fuck man.

73
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:01,170
What the fuck is wrong with you
don't bleed no fucking games.

74
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,380
Ah.

75
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,990
So I got to sneak out,

76
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:07,321
man.

77
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,154
I'm like,

78
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,610
how the fuck?

79
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:12,750
I'm like any special place you
want it to bite me like my deck.

80
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,083
It's like,

81
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,660
where's good?

82
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,640
How about the leg?

83
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:18,270
I'm like,

84
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,103
fine.

85
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,960
So I got to Cobra out and
I pulled my pant leg up,

86
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,770
Shimmin him a little bit and stuck
my leg up here and he fucking bet me,

87
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,211
you know,

88
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:27,481
three,

89
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,021
four seconds.

90
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:28,854
Let's go.

91
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,550
March was like,

92
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:29,701
no,

93
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:30,780
don't book your move.

94
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:32,020
Don't take no lectures.

95
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,330
Don't take no pills.

96
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,373
Pitcher,

97
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,103
Shit.

98
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,790
Just fucking shit there.

99
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,690
I want to see the boys.

100
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:43,800
You go through your body

101
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,233
and

102
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,230
finally after about 10 minutes,

103
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:51,064
she's like,

104
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,991
I'm going to get,

105
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:52,820
you're going to be okay.

106
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,400
Oh sorry.

107
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,540
Didn't fucking make you happy.

108
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,563
You know,

109
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,410
if I know you want me to die,

110
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,120
he's like no being which night brother,

111
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,660
you fever once this snake,

112
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:05,680
let's go with me

113
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,680
bringing back may want you looking back
up again because I want this idea to

114
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,960
fucking amicus both
some fucking big money.

115
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,381
Yeah.

116
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,250
Can you dig it?

117
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,911
Dig It.

118
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:16,330
All right,

119
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,163
we're out of here.

120
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,450
Wow,

121
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:18,710
that's it.

122
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,810
All right motherfucker.

123
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:20,644
You wait.

124
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,420
It was pitch man.

125
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,470
Cause it's one thing to get
bit and the heat of a moment.

126
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,140
But to sit there and fucking cold have
to hike or fucking pant legs up and let a

127
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,030
fucking snake chew on you to
make a motherfucker happy.

128
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:34,301
Come on,

129
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,134
give me a break.

130
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,311
We're asking a lot.

131
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,750
So if all those people were there,

132
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,680
I wouldn't have felt any
effects to sit there.

133
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,720
And I in the locker room cold,

134
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,133
really?

135
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,750
Eh,

136
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,980
no budge pumping other.

137
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:49,660
So I remember during
the match and we do it.

138
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,070
Imagine when it comes down,

139
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,510
time in the ropes,

140
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,180
you get the snake out came this,

141
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,580
make sure he's little unhappiness.

142
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,120
When I turned my back to macho man,

143
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:01,720
he doesn't see me and I fucking paint
brush the hell out of this fucking snake.

144
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
I pounded that motherfucker.

145
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,060
Why?

146
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,400
In a second time his fucking mouth full
up and brother and he's looking for

147
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,690
anything to fucking bikers,

148
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,240
you know?

149
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,510
And I just went whoa.

150
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,470
And took him to macho man and Boomi
latched on and he's true and he's shown my

151
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:17,740
match.

152
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,573
You're doing a great job.

153
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,590
Well Randy,

154
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,570
you look so believable.

155
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:24,590
Oh God to him,

156
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:24,950
you know,

157
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,440
and he's fucking nuts.

158
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,890
What did they do to the snake and
move this poison glands and I,

159
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,711
the venom sac.

160
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:32,290
Yeah.

161
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,990
So there's no venom in its body damaged.

162
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,370
They replaced it with fucking

163
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,370
stuff they use for bullying plants,

164
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:39,671
man,

165
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,504
you know

166
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,301
silicone,

167
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,030
silicone.

168
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,780
Who are these guys to de Judge also,

169
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:47,010
because Mike didn't tell you,

170
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,650
but one of the judges on
that tribunal who was saying,

171
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,041
Oh,

172
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:54,060
you're a piece of shit for making fun
of a kid after that was found to have

173
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:54,691
kitty porn.

174
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:55,890
He was some kind of child molester.

175
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,070
He was judging that he
was too shitty to a kid.

176
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,860
There were two people at the Human Rights
Commission in Quebec that we're one of

177
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:02,240
them.

178
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,460
Uh,

179
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,350
what's the precedent that had to resign
that he had paid off a 13 year old girl

180
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,940
like 15 years ago to not tell
anyone that he had had sex with her.

181
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,320
And then another one,

182
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,750
I think he had had sex with a,

183
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,070
it was a six year old,

184
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:19,140
like it was fucking crazy.

185
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,820
But these motherfuckers that,

186
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,630
that's what I hated.

187
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,170
These,

188
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,400
these people were telling me,

189
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:23,911
okay,

190
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:24,630
you're,

191
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,830
you did a joke onstage and
that's all and your intent,

192
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,090
that's what people forget oftentimes
in my intent wasn't to hurt this little

193
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:33,300
kid.

194
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,280
My intent was to make people laugh.

195
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,420
But these guys,

196
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:40,680
their intent was to put their dick
inside of a child that's fucking,

197
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,660
and they judged him and they judged me.

198
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,950
It's fucking crazy.

199
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,461
Well,

200
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:45,990
hypocrisy knows no bounds.

201
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,820
And I think you know anybody
that's doing anything like that,

202
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,790
it's just a sickness
that's incomprehensible.

203
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,440
These fucking guys,

204
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:55,740
man.

205
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,550
So they put you through
some shit like you,

206
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,380
you went through this for a long time.

207
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,040
Like my,

208
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,230
my lawyer went when I first met my lawyer,

209
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:03,981
I told him,

210
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:04,461
he was like,

211
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:04,641
look,

212
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:05,750
they want you to settle.

213
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,741
And he goes,

214
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,190
I could,

215
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,671
I could,

216
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:08,504
um,

217
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,140
get it reduced,

218
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,831
get it reduced.

219
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:10,760
So like 20 grand.

220
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,120
And I was,

221
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,631
I told him,

222
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:11,901
I said,

223
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:12,621
if I do that,

224
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,150
I'm fucking everyone.

225
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,650
Like any comic in Canada is going to be
fuck cause I'm going to set this weird

226
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:19,280
precedent.

227
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,851
So I told him,

228
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:20,270
I was like,

229
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,440
I'd rather give you 100,000
then give them five.

230
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,320
So then,

231
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,971
but he told me,

232
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,660
he was like,

233
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,860
we can't win the,

234
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,120
the,

235
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,780
cause I didn't go to court.

236
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,630
I went to the human rights tribunal.

237
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,560
I was judged by the human rights tribunal
and the Human Rights Commission was

238
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:37,340
bringing me there.

239
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,460
So it was me versus them judged by them.

240
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,331
So he told me,

241
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,550
you're definitely going to
lose to the kangaroo court.

242
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,030
Yeah.

243
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,790
But he said,

244
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,290
yeah.

245
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,120
He said,

246
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,490
uh,

247
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,790
then we'll appeal and the
government will probably accept the,

248
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,050
to to listen to the,

249
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:51,890
the case again.

250
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,671
And then he goes,

251
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,570
then you'll win that.

252
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,220
And,

253
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,640
but so I said yes.

254
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:56,150
I was like,

255
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,421
look,

256
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:56,511
I,

257
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,590
I have to do this.

258
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,424
And I'm out.

259
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,120
I,

260
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,910
I loved rocky and there
was something weird about,

261
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,450
I was like,

262
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,920
this is like fucking rocky too.

263
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,490
I'm going to be loose and
then I'll get out to an LP,

264
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:08,324
the champ.

265
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:08,750
So,

266
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,200
but,

267
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,940
so then I was,

268
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,670
something really weird
happened to me though,

269
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,050
is I didn't,

270
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,860
I didn't think it did affect me this much
because when I was in court and I saw

271
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:21,320
this kid's family fucking crying,

272
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,860
and I was like,

273
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,640
Holy Fuck,

274
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:22,881
okay,

275
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:25,790
these people really took
this shit seriously.

276
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,390
And I felt it was weird because my,

277
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,001
my joke,

278
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:30,770
my intent was to make people laugh.

279
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:31,221
And this kid,

280
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,980
I fucking nothing against this kid.

281
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:33,771
I don't,

282
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:34,604
I don't,

283
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,140
I don't not like them.

284
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:36,600
I don't,

285
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,160
you know,

286
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,170
but then to see that they took this,

287
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,610
this seriously and then the,

288
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,980
how the media was portraying me,

289
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,431
like,

290
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:43,870
uh,

291
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,110
the,

292
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,180
the in,

293
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,580
I did a series of shows in
Edinburgh and there's a newspaper,

294
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,360
Montreal,

295
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,170
the road,

296
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,003
Mike Ward,

297
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Mike Ward is getting rich off of this
little boy and I was doing shows in

298
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,210
Edinburgh that no one makes money.

299
00:07:59,210 --> 00:07:59,900
They're like,

300
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,530
I was playing like the 200
seat theater and I was like,

301
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:03,741
oh,

302
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:07,910
these fuckers are making me look like
I becoming rich because of this little

303
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,180
kid.

304
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,140
He became a target.

305
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,590
Yeah.

306
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,760
And then click bait.

307
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,560
That's how they get
people to pay attention.

308
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,240
And I didn't think it did affect me,

309
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,040
but the thing that,

310
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,700
I think the reason why it did affect,

311
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,070
affect me is if all you get is hate,

312
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,150
you can block it out.

313
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,230
It's super easy to block,

314
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:21,960
hate out.

315
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,840
And I'll error if all you get is love.

316
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,683
That's easy too.

317
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,270
But I was getting hate and love,

318
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:26,720
so,

319
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,650
so I'd be like,

320
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,191
you know,

321
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,240
I wouldn't let the hate in.

322
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,460
But then someone had shown
me love side open up,

323
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:36,461
and then the hated come in and it was
just so fucking weird and F and I was like

324
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,290
googling myself too much.

325
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,290
I'd be like,

326
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,123
oh.

327
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:40,910
I'd be like,

328
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,091
oh,

329
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:41,391
fuck.

330
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:41,631
Okay.

331
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,090
There's an article about me in,

332
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,993
in Russia,

333
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,210
and then I Google translate to
see that I'm a piece of garbage.

334
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:57,360
Yeah.
