1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,940
Sound good?
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,941 --> 00:00:02,830
We're good.
Five,

3
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:04,270
four,
three,

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,433
two.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,830
That was a.
That was like,

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,140
you didn't do the film.
I wasn't sure it was her finger button.

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,641
Chris,
what's up man?

8
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:14,750
How are you?
Good man.

9
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:15,440
How you doing,
Joe?

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,760
Thanks for doing this.
Uh,

11
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,790
for people to name right now,
Chris is the author of how to hike the

12
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:26,360
Appalachian trail and he's also,
I've talked about this on the podcast

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,590
for this is his company is not a
sponsor.

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,270
This is company,
a green belly meals and these are these

15
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:37,271
really delicious bars that are.
They weigh like 50 pounds a brick filled

16
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,380
with nutrients and food and they're
really good for people who did this

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,300
crazy appalachian trail thing and these,
these bars that you sell have become

18
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:52,301
very popular with hunters and people
that like to go on a backpack.

19
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:57,551
Journeys deep into the back country and
I found out about you from a rich,

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,970
rich,
rich outdoors podcast and that's where I

21
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:04,310
listened to you on his podcast and
that's why.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,050
That's why you're here.
That's what I got.

23
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,690
Cody loved the podcast.
Yeah,

24
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:12,380
it's a good podcast.
So what the fuck for people who don't

25
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,810
know the Appalachian trail,
we've talked about this on the podcast

26
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,870
before,
but it's a trail where people walk from

27
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:21,380
Georgia,
right all the way up to Maine or,

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,870
or vice versa,
vice versa if you want,

29
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:27,440
if you're a madman and it takes you.
How many months?

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,570
Five to seven.
Took me a little over six.

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,280
So you just hike for six months,
but when you're at month three,

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,770
do you ever go like,
what the fuck am I doing?

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,530
Long story short?
Yeah.

34
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,350
Uh,
and by month three I was actually

35
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:50,150
approaching winter time and you know,
wintertime camping is just a

36
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,630
fundamentally different experience.
So not only have you been hiking that

37
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,550
long and you're tired and your body's
just,

38
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,700
you know,
just done doing it every day of hiking.

39
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,090
But then the elements of the,
of the winter come in and that's,

40
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,670
that was a different ballgame entirely.
You know,

41
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,990
how many people have done this?
Less than $10,000.

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,590
That's a lot of fucking people.
Yeah,

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,060
it is still a lot.
I would have said like 50,

44
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,340
uh,
there's another thing called the triple

45
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:17,390
crown,
which is the,

46
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,290
it's the,
uh,

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,650
it's,
it's the 80 a pacific crest trail and

48
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:24,740
the continental divide trail and I think
less than a hundred people have done all

49
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:25,520
three of those.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,520
The Pacific crest trail,
is that the one that goes from like

51
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,330
Mexico tall to

52
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,070
Canada?
It's through California.

53
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,920
That's insane.
How long did that one take?

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,440
Uh,
I think so.

55
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,190
Appalachian trail is 2100 miles and the
Pacific crest trail,

56
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:45,600
I believe it's like 25,
26 when he was 700 miles.

57
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:50,601
But the trail gradient is a lot easier.
So I think like on any given day you can

58
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:54,240
actually hike more miles even though the
trails is longer than the 80,

59
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,700
but I think people actually finish it
faster than the eat.

60
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,800
I like how you call it the 80 inside
lingo

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,650
maniacs.
Are you hiking maniacs?

62
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,350
Yeah.
What the fuck got you into this man?

63
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,830
Uh,
it's a long story.

64
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:09,460
Short boy scouts.
Yeah,

65
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,010
I did.
Um,

66
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,400
I joined boy scouts later than most
people I joined when I was 14.

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,470
And uh,
you know,

68
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:19,500
the kind of the pinnacle of the Boy
Scout Careers,

69
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:23,130
getting your Eagle Scout.
And I joined with that in mind.

70
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:23,611
I was like,
okay,

71
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:26,460
I'm joining later than most I joined
when most people are quitting boy

72
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:27,360
scouts,
you know,

73
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:31,050
they go from cub scouts like 13 and I
quit by joined and I was like,

74
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:33,400
all right,
I want my eagle scout and we,

75
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:36,050
you have to,
in order to get your Eagle Scout spin 20

76
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,580
nights in the woods,
not consecutively,

77
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:39,930
but you have to,
um,

78
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,540
get your camping merit badge and get
your camping merit badge.

79
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,730
You have to spend the night 20 nights in
the woods.

80
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:46,490
So,
uh,

81
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,640
you know,
that was in Georgia and the foothills of

82
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:52,860
the Appalachian mountains are in north
Georgia.

83
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,800
So the,
you know,

84
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,010
the,
the beginning of the Appalachian trail

85
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:56,850
is also,
you know,

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,530
right there.
So we went on several trips up there in

87
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:03,990
north Georgia and I got exposed to it,
you know,

88
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,220
and I think the,
just the idea of getting on this small

89
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:10,070
trail and um,
you know,

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,080
kind of looking down and understanding
that this thing goes on for 2000 more

91
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:20,070
miles was just kinda like one that just
seems crazy.

92
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:20,670
Right.
You know,

93
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,390
there's no way I'm ever going to have
enough time or we're kind of the uh,

94
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:26,430
the drive to do that.
But um,

95
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,140
yeah,
there was definitely kind of the

96
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:28,831
mystery.
I was like,

97
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:30,510
Oh man,
that just seems like an adventure I want

98
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:32,040
to do.
Uh,

99
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,030
so yeah,
that was,

100
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,850
that was definitely the beginning of it
when I was about 14 years old going up

101
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:37,740
there and hiking on it for overnight
trips.

102
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,830
Now,
how does one fund something like this?

103
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,270
Because I would assume you,
they have to be independently wealthy or

104
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:49,710
you have to have squirreled away enough
money so you could walk for seven months

105
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,950
and feed yourself in the process.
Or did you work along the way?

106
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:53,784
I mean,
you can't.

107
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,260
What do you do?

108
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,530
I think there's a big misconception that
like a,

109
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,950
it takes a lot of money,
but in reality it's like what are your

110
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,450
expenses?
It's just food,

111
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,040
you know,
and then gear ahead of time.

112
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,410
So,
um,

113
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,960
you know,
most hikers are kind of known as the,

114
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,260
like the Athletic Hobo,
you know,

115
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:15,540
like they are grimy,
they're not spending money on hotels,

116
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,870
there's no accommodation,
there's no car payments,

117
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,120
you know,
they're walking so you can really

118
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,850
eliminate all expenses when you do that.
But,

119
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:24,690
um,
I mean for me,

120
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,640
I had a,
I was an accountant,

121
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,350
so,
uh,

122
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,390
I'd been an accountant for about,
uh,

123
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,870
two years and I saved up some money and
uh,

124
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,620
I basically knew that I wanted to take
the hit so I started saving up some

125
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,380
money,
but any,

126
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,460
any given through hiker,
that's what they're called.

127
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:43,020
Anybody that does,
um,

128
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,790
you know,
it starts in Georgia,

129
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,270
ends in Maine or Maine to Georgia.
Anybody that does that hike,

130
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,760
um,
in one consecutive runs,

131
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,490
it's called a through hiker,
but any,

132
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:56,010
any through hike I would,
I would say it takes about $5,000 from

133
00:05:56,011 --> 00:06:01,011
gear to sleeping in hotels about once a
week to resupplying foods.

134
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:06,971
So thinking about $5,000 for six months
of living like ain't too bad,

135
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,130
you know,
you think about $5,000 for six months of

136
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,250
living in the real world.
Like I've never lived that cheaply,

137
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:13,830
you know?

138
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,281
Right.
Well,

139
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,510
it's not that bad.
No,

140
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,480
but like you're saying hotels once a
week.

141
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:22,110
So what would merit a hotel stay is a
ferocious whether,

142
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:22,944
like what,

143
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,340
um,
a lot of things.

144
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,830
So you,
you typically are within five to seven

145
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:31,850
days of a town,
so the trail kind of goes along the

146
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:36,851
mountains and then about every five to
seven days you come to a trail crossing,

147
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,070
which is a highway or anything that
would lead to a nearby town and every

148
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:45,590
five to seven days you're out of food.
You know,

149
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:48,430
that's the biggest thing that I think
pulls you into towns.

150
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,380
You need to resupply.
So you're not out there foraging for

151
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:54,350
nuts and berries or or hunting or
anything like that.

152
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,990
You're,
you're relying on getting to town,

153
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,740
getting to a grocery store and getting
all your food.

154
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:03,740
So every five to seven days you go into
town and you get food.

155
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:05,030
It's like,
whoa man,

156
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:07,190
I also haven't showered in five to seven
days.

157
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:10,260
I also haven't done laundry in five to
seven days and you know,

158
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,090
you're hiking with really one change of
clothes.

159
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,760
So you can imagine if you're hiking 20
miles a day,

160
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,700
the grime and the dirt that can build
up.

161
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:23,240
So when you come to town,
you want to do laundry,

162
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,640
resupply food,
you want to stay in a hotel,

163
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:29,990
you want to clean off your body,
your feet are starting to grow stuff.

164
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,850
You know,
you've been sweating,

165
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,660
walking through muddy trails.
There's just a lot of grime.

166
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:39,530
When you get to town,
it's like a big refresh,

167
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,160
you know?

168
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,170
But when you make that big refresh,
do you,

169
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,850
do you ever go,
why am I doing this?

170
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,263
Yeah,
it's kind of,

171
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,060
it's kind of ironic.
You're on you.

172
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,850
You make the intention of going down the
trail to get outside of town and outside

173
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:54,040
of society,
but one of the biggest things you look

174
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,500
forward to is getting back into town,
you know?

175
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,251
Um,
yeah.

176
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:58,870
And it's kind of like you said,
well,

177
00:07:58,871 --> 00:07:59,920
you know,
when you get to town it's like,

178
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,570
why am I doing this?
You are kind of.

179
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,750
I was kind of dreading getting back out
on the trail a lot of times because it

180
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,790
was just so.
Oh Man,

181
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,710
I have a hot shower,
like I shaved,

182
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:10,270
like,
so nice.

183
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
Yeah.
The first time I did any camping in

184
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,730
since the boys scouts.
You're.

185
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,230
Yeah,
I was a boy scout when I was 13 for one

186
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,740
summer,
but these fucking inner city creeps that

187
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:28,800
I went to the boy scouts with and
Jamaica Plain Massachusetts,

188
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,440
which is like,
and now it's more a gentrified,

189
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:34,380
but back then it was kind of a shady
neighborhood picking on,

190
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,201
you know.
Well,

191
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:37,860
they were,
they would Thai kids up and leave them

192
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:41,190
in the woods.
They would tie you up to your bunk and

193
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,230
then leave you in the woods.
They put toothpaste all over your

194
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,360
clothes,
but you can't get out there just fucking

195
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:46,840
shitty kids.
It was,

196
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,580
it was like a total free fall for all.
It was just really didn't because we

197
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:53,520
went to the woods in New Hampshire.
That's where the boy scouts or take you

198
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:57,950
up and I remember like these fucking
camp counselors are weird guys that

199
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:02,040
barely paying attention and it's
basically like all these inner city

200
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,540
teenagers,
street scouts,

201
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,000
yeah.

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,010
There's just running rampant.
Like uh,

203
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,010
there was a rifle range where they would
shoot 20 twos and there was an archery

204
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,390
range.
And I remember I was at the archery

205
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:14,850
range.
I hurt and I was like,

206
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:15,900
what the fuck is that?
And they go,

207
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:18,940
that's a ricochet and I'm at what?
Alright,

208
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,680
check please.
And so I decided to just go fishing

209
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,500
every day I was there.
I would avoid everybody.

210
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:28,980
There was like all those things on the
agenda that you were supposed to do,

211
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,530
fuck you.
I just took off and I went and found

212
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:35,190
this pond and I would go to that pond
every day for the week that I was up

213
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,700
there.
My point being sent from that time from

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
13 till 2012,
I had had not gone camping and then I

215
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:48,330
went camping in Montana in October and
really cold,

216
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,660
it was like nine degrees and we were out
there for six or seven days and when we

217
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:57,840
went back we went back to a hotel and I
remember thinking this is the greatest

218
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:01,260
shower the world has ever known.
Like that feeling.

219
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:03,660
You don't appreciate showers.
Oh No.

220
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,660
Probably nobody appreciates a shower,
like an appalachian trail hiker.

221
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:07,680
Right.
Does that make sense?

222
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,820
It's pure ecstasy,
like showers normal,

223
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,530
like a normal showers normal.
But it's like if you got to shower after

224
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:21,531
you're hiking for seven days with muddy
feet and your clothes stink and

225
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,860
everything's gross and

226
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,730
yeah,
you need that deprivation to appreciate

227
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:26,210
it,
you know,

228
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,320
you do.
Right.

229
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,480
Because most people don't appreciate
showers.

230
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,520
Yeah.
I guess it's like the starving kid

231
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,230
needing,
you know,

232
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,380
when he gets food,
he's like,

233
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,610
oh,
you know,

234
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,990
yeah.
Or like a guy who just getting out of

235
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:41,700
prison and get some sex.
You're not getting any prison.

236
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,330
Um,
so what kind of Weirdos do you meet on

237
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:47,164
the trail?

238
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,780
You gotta yeah,
you gotTa keep in mind anybody who's

239
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,270
willing to take six months out of their
life to go to the woods,

240
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,890
it's going to be a different breed.
I mean,

241
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:56,570
I think you definitely have your
stereotypes.

242
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,180
Um,
some people are other just kind of for

243
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,530
the challenge and the a out of,
dare I say athletic side of it,

244
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:06,940
but it's like a different side of it,
right?

245
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,210
Sure.
It's Kinda like a,

246
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:11,000
I want to power through this and see how
much my body can handle.

247
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,680
You get those kinds of hikers,
but you definitely get the,

248
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,210
the hippie dropout,
a life kind of guys,

249
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,850
you know,
it's just like I just want to get out

250
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:20,601
there and,
and,

251
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,760
uh,
get away from society for a little bit

252
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:24,950
so that,
that kind of stereotype.

253
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,170
You definitely,
those are just gonna get some Weirdos

254
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:27,920
out there.

255
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,400
Yeah,
I would imagine if you ever had an

256
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,090
uncomfortable moments where you like
scared to camp with people.

257
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,200
No doubt.
There was one time a man,

258
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,340
there was a Pennsylvania.
So Pennsylvania,

259
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:39,651
uh,
you know,

260
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:41,530
a lot of those x coal towns,
um,

261
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:46,531
their economy just plummeted and the,
it goes through a lot of those towns.

262
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,780
So you'd have some people near town
going out there for an overnight or,

263
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:55,810
and they are what are called,
they're like these three walled wooden

264
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:58,510
structures that are made by,
um,

265
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,100
well all sorts of organizations make
them.

266
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:03,340
But in general they're about every 10 to
20 miles along the 80.

267
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,840
So in theory you can sleep in these
every night and not need a tent.

268
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,400
I wouldn't recommend that.
But,

269
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,770
um,
you do try to sleep in the shelters as

270
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,290
much as possible.
But the fact that there are these

271
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,980
shelters,
a lot of people kind of bottleneck to

272
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:22,450
them because they know they're there.
So you will sometimes get to a shelter

273
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,870
at night and it won't only be a t
through hikers there,

274
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,130
there'll be people from town.

275
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,960
Um,
but they,

276
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:31,060
I remember one time in Pennsylvania,
there were these,

277
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,760
there was this couple.
Yeah,

278
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,860
they were literally,
it was pouring rain.

279
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:36,910
So we get there.
And I was like,

280
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,490
there's no way I'm camping out.
There's no way I'm hiking on like I'm

281
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,750
sleeping in the shelter,
you know,

282
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,840
I was drenched to the bone,
my gear was drenched and I was pissed

283
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:45,400
off.
It was like a midnight,

284
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,420
you know,
I had been hiking all day.

285
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,370
I was just exhausted.
I'm so,

286
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:52,900
so excited to get to the shelter and
there's a couple and they are literally

287
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,130
yelling at each other,
you know,

288
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,960
I,
I can hear them for like a model,

289
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,130
like just furiously yelling at each
other and you get there and they are.

290
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:02,020
Um,
I never really knew,

291
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:05,590
but I'm assuming they were cracked out.
I saw some little glass pieces going in

292
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,930
between their hands and just the way
they're acting.

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He kept like throwing up his fists at or
he smashed a bottle on the wall in the

294
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,980
shelter and uh,
yeah,

295
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,440
he pulled out a knife at one point and
it was just like.

296
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,610
So are these individuals shelters or is
a large shelter when you see three

297
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:22,990
walls?
Like how big are these things?

298
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,180
Uh,
I think they're usually maybe

299
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,840
about this size,
length of this table,

300
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,960
maybe about 10,
10 feet wide.

301
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,980
And there's only one of them,
so like,

302
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,900
you're supposed to share them with those
other people.

303
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,250
Yeah.
So you're in there with these cracked

304
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:41,770
out people.
Luckily I had three other hiking buddies

305
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:45,910
with me guys and the people,
granted they were aggressive towards

306
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,530
each other,
like they didn't bother us.

307
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,510
And,
and like I think by like 4:00 AM,

308
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,720
they hadn't gotten to sleep and we were
just like,

309
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,350
dude,
can you all please,

310
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,190
please be quiet.

311
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,870
Like I got to get some sleep.
And then,

312
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,050
uh,
um,

313
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,170
but that was the worst one.
Other than that,

314
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,650
I think everything was,
everything was pretty safe.

315
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,960
There's nothing too terrifying.
How did it play out?

316
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,180
Uh,
we left the next morning.

317
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,600
And did they eventually go to sleep?
Uh,

318
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,590
you know what,
I don't even remember.

319
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:14,380
I think at 4:00 AM,
I was so exhausted I was just like,

320
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,290
they were still yelling at each other.
I was just out,

321
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,420
you know.
And that was what they were yelling.

322
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,390
I was just this one of those shelters.
There you go.

323
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:25,360
Yeah.
That's one of them was looking little

324
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:26,560
place.
It's Kinda cool.

325
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,660
It's all made out of logs.
Yeah,

326
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,740
it's got kind of a tin roof.
Is that like a 10 sheet roof?

327
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:33,821
Uh,
yeah,

328
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:35,620
they vary a lot.
I mean you'll get all.

329
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,050
Would you sometimes won't even get logs.
Yeah,

330
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,760
there you go.
You can scroll up and see all the other

331
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,890
ones.
And those are for the hikers,

332
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,080
is that what they're for?
Yeah.

333
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,880
So that's.
So they've,

334
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,340
they've anticipated,
there's so many people that do this

335
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:51,980
trail that they've made these shelters.
I've heard of

336
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,820
these things in New Zealand.
Yeah,

337
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,040
too.
Yeah,

338
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:59,630
they have them and they stock food in
them and they leave a log so that hikers

339
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:03,020
can write down.
Like my friend Remy,

340
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,800
Remy Warren was in New Zealand and he
used one of those and like wrote in the

341
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,581
log,
you know,

342
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:12,410
where he was from when he was there.
And I guess it also helps identify if

343
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,244
people are missing.

344
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,661
Exactly,
yeah.

345
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:16,590
I think it's a safety precaution.
So if,

346
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,960
you know,
you can kind of track down where it was

347
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:19,550
the last person seen,
you know,

348
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,290
or wherever they last seen.
So if they were,

349
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,450
if they logged into a shelter and then,
you know,

350
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,730
they can't find them,
they can say okay,

351
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:29,780
on this date we know that they were here
so you can give a given radius and know

352
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:33,170
that if they are missing their within,
at least within a certain,

353
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:35,150
you know,
20 miles in distance walking distance of

354
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,200
their.
But yeah.

355
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,320
And I think those things actually turned
into like a just fun.

356
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:42,320
You know,
some people just go full on poems and

357
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:43,760
there some,
you know,

358
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,150
confess like life stories and they're
like,

359
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,980
Oh God,
yeah.

360
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,590
The trail log books are entertaining the
doubt.

361
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,100
Wow.
Here,

362
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:54,330
warning,
what does it say?

363
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,450
Harassing Baron.
Camp night of five,

364
00:15:57,451 --> 00:16:02,451
11 swipe clause in two tents
stepped on my tent.

365
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,230
Tila collapsed on me.
Please be careful he didn't even try to

366
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:10,040
get the food hanging low on a branch
here.

367
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,160
Oh,
look at her name.

368
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,200
Flower passion flower with a sad face.
And there's another one.

369
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:17,490
Bear rip.
This is a different.

370
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,070
This is a different person's
handwriting.

371
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,670
Bear rip the bag hanging on my pack,
which was hanging on my hammock.

372
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,640
I was Muslim.
Say Bullshit.

373
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,170
Bouncing,
bouncing up and down.

374
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,050
He stole my toilet paper.
Exclamation point.

375
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,850
What does that say?
Subway.

376
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:37,590
That's his name.
Subway.

377
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,550
Eat fresh.

378
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,710
Yeah.
Ps,

379
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,540
the pivot is great.
What's a pivot?

380
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,580
Are Pretty.
It's the a privilege.

381
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,620
It's just like an outhouse.
Oh,

382
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,143
compost.
Toilet.

383
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,940
How about this one?
Dat Shit cray all balls.

384
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,770
Ghetto Savior,
Baltimore.

385
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,040
All balls.
Ghetto Savior,

386
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,550
Baltimore.
Oh,

387
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:04,830
okay.
Okay.

388
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,500
Well you're dealing with like fringe
people,

389
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:12,480
right?
I mean these are people that are just

390
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:15,360
not fitting into the corporate module

391
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,890
very well.
They walked out on life a little bit.

392
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:18,910
Yeah,
a little bit.

393
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,350
Well you kind of did too,
right?

394
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,060
I mean you said you were an accountant.

395
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,570
Yeah,
I was an accountant in Birmingham,

396
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,890
so it was an accounting major and uh,
did that for about two years.

397
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,020
Um,
I mean the job was good and everybody

398
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,890
worked with I liked,
but I definitely was able to recognize

399
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:38,490
that there's not.
I was not going to be an accountant know

400
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,520
from my life.
So,

401
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,720
um,
yeah,

402
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,730
I think I knew it was going to do some
transition.

403
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,440
Try to get another job,
do something.

404
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,761
And the,
uh,

405
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:48,220
the ATU is kinda like,
this seems like the right thing to do,

406
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,911
you know,
and I'm,

407
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,540
I'm single at the time,
you know,

408
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,070
no kids a debt free,
like,

409
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,200
you know,
I didn't have a mortgage like time to

410
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:55,910
go,

411
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,770
so it just seemed like something this
radical because it's so crazy.

412
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:05,771
Committing to a six to seven month hike
was going to force you to just change

413
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,090
existence,
change your frequency,

414
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,170
the whole deal.
I mean,

415
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,490
you're a freak now.
You're,

416
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:17,900
you're wandering through the land
with all due respect.

417
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,730
Thanks dude.
I mean it's not a bad forever.

418
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,460
Like my best friends are freaks,
but it's,

419
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:27,110
I mean,
it's definitely a freak move,

420
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:27,910
right?
I mean,

421
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,880
no doubt.
Yeah,

422
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,190
well it's a,
it's a very strange subset of human

423
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:38,890
beings that don't not just drop out but
dropout.

424
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,391
And I mean,
you're,

425
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:42,340
you're committing to something that is.
I mean,

426
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:44,160
there was,
there ever a time we were like halfway

427
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:46,110
there we like,
maybe we just get a job in this fucking

428
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:46,944
town.

429
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,050
Uh,
and then some people did that,

430
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:50,500
you know,
I think that was more for financial

431
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:51,251
reasons.
It was like,

432
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:54,550
all right,
I gotta I gotta get some cash flow,

433
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,420
but a no man,
I think I definitely had kinda like a

434
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:00,820
grind mindset.
Like I'm gonna make it,

435
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,780
I'm going to make it,
you know,

436
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:04,780
and I think that yeah.
Did you go with a bunch of people

437
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,660
know?
Uh,

438
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,930
I think like 90 percent of hikers go on
eat alone and the fact that they're

439
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,280
just,
there are a lot of hikers out there,

440
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:18,310
surprisingly particularly going north.
You,

441
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:22,180
I think maybe 2000 people try to go
north every year.

442
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,190
Wow.
So when you're hiking,

443
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,860
there's like a gang of people on the
trail with you.

444
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,440
So,
but if you go south,

445
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,293
um,
it,

446
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,200
it changes every year,
but 10 to 15 percent of people that hike

447
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:34,740
the Antigo self,
it's like you're going to have much less

448
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,360
social circles,
stuff like that.

449
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,290
But in general,
you know,

450
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,450
people are hiking,
running like you're gonna meet people,

451
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,060
you're talking about the shelters,
like you're going to stumble into people

452
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,130
walking by,
you're going to meet them in town,

453
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:47,220
you're gonna meet him at the shelters
and they become your buddies.

454
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:48,054
You know,
like,

455
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,210
even I think the first,
the first night I was on the it.

456
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:54,090
Yeah,
I made good friends with two other

457
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:57,120
people and hiked with them for a couple
of weeks and then,

458
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,700
you know,
different paces.

459
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,000
You've made up different people.
You might hike with somebody for a

460
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,930
month.
Uh,

461
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:08,370
so it's Kinda like you just
hike for a little bit with some people,

462
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,720
you know,
for some given a time.

463
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,050
Wow.
What kind of weird stories are they

464
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:13,910
telling you about why they're out there?
I mean,

465
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:17,960
how many people are out there just like
duck in a murder wrap or something?

466
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,080
Was it,
um,

467
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,780
is it Eric Rudolph?
Which one was.

468
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,310
Hey,
Eric Rudolph didn't.

469
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:28,311
He ran out and eat and like he,
he was hiding out there for a long time.

470
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,840
Oh yeah.
He was like the unabomber.

471
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,311
No,
no,

472
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:32,950
no,
that's,

473
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,800
that's not the unabomber.
The unabomber is Ted Kaczynski.

474
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,530
He's that guy that was in the park
bomber.

475
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,820
Oh,
okay.

476
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,040
So I believe it was Eric Rudolph was
found in a dumpster in North Carolina.

477
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,880
He had been hiding out,
like full on hiker,

478
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,380
homeless,
look,

479
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,300
beard grown.
But he had been,

480
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,940
you know,
hiding out on a t,

481
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,310
it seems like that would be a lot of
play,

482
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,940
a place where a lot of people get robbed
because you'd know that you have money

483
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:59,920
on you because you have to make this
trail,

484
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,830
you have to have some cash to buy food.
And

485
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,840
I never heard anything bad like that
happened.

486
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:06,830
Honestly.
I know that they're,

487
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:10,280
there have been a few murders on the 80.
Oh Shit.

488
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,530
But you think about,
think about any given city,

489
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,400
the murder rate,
you know,

490
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:16,520
it's like if you have 2000 through
hikers plus,

491
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,080
I mean 100,000 weakened hikers a year.
I mean more than that,

492
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,080
it's like the probability,
if you think about the 80 hikers as a

493
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:26,810
city,
like a murder every few years,

494
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:28,730
really it and in bed,
you know,

495
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,020
that's the same logic that they use for
those um,

496
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,850
foxconn buildings where the people jump
off the buildings where they're making

497
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:37,830
cell phones in China that go,
well,

498
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:39,690
you've got to think about how many
people work here.

499
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:41,080
Of course,
if you'd kill themselves,

500
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:42,780
it's just a game of numbers at that
point.

501
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:43,340
Right.
Somebody,

502
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,120
somebody's going to do it.
I guess it is.

503
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,080
So will you ever there when any of that
went down?

504
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,110
They were looking for a murder.

505
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,070
Know there was a famous case.
Oh,

506
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,000
I forgot her name.
Her hiker name.

507
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,990
Hold on her name flower.
All right.

508
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,550
So that's what passion flower was.
That's go to trail name.

509
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,380
Oh Geez.
Rappers.

510
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,840
Yeah.
So you get,

511
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,760
you get your
Dj Joe.

512
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,400
Yeah.
You get your trail name within,

513
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:17,190
I mean yeah,
within a week of being on trail within a

514
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,290
week.
Usually it's usually if you do something

515
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:23,130
monumental or stupid or something
noteworthy is going to give you.

516
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,710
You dubbed a name.
Wow.

517
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,210
Do you know my name?
Yes.

518
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,640
It was smooth.
Smooth,

519
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,420
smooth.
So I'd been in New Zealand prior to the

520
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:36,240
Aat and I had talked about not like
showering for a week at a time.

521
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,370
We're getting real personal here,
but I shaved my legs and I had shaved my

522
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:43,290
body here so I could just like wipe
down.

523
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,770
Okay.
And so when I came and ate at want to do

524
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:47,491
the same thing,
I was like,

525
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,640
I'm just going to shave my body here so
I can literally wipe down at night,

526
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,830
um,
and like check out for ticks,

527
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,770
like just made snakes and a.
and um,

528
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,830
yeah,
I was sitting right a fire early on,

529
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:01,560
like a couple of nights in and I'm
wearing my like,

530
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:04,020
sweaty legs for like,
glistening in the fire.

531
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,480
And some guy was just like,
dude,

532
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,960
do you shave your legs?
I'm like,

533
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,580
uh,
no.

534
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,250
Uh,
and then yeah,

535
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,560
smooth just came from.

536
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,920
That's a funny one man.
What a man makes a decision to shave his

537
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,320
legs.
That's how,

538
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,010
you know,
I never have,

539
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,640
I've shaved some body parts.
I've shaped my butt.

540
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm sorry,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

541
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,950
I've shaved my butthole a two,
perhaps three times.

542
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:34,990
I just had this conversation with
someone about this the other day

543
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,190
because,
uh,

544
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,970
it's,
you know,

545
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,830
I'm Harry,
I'm a hairy dude other than the top of

546
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,180
my head.
But uh,

547
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,070
I get hairy and so it's not the best for
like keeping clean.

548
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,640
So one day I was shaving my package and
I said,

549
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,200
let's just get crazy,
let's go all the way down there,

550
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,570
finish it all.
And I did.

551
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:57,440
And one of the things I was shocked was
it changes the sound of your farts.

552
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,710
Did we talk about this on the podcast
before?

553
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:03,220
I've heard it discussed on another
podcast I talked about,

554
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,073
right?

555
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,320
Yeah.
It changes the sound of your farts.

556
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,070
They become more duck like.
Yeah.

557
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,280
It's like something about your butt hair
that muffles not that's the biggest

558
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,250
issue in the world,
but I'm also,

559
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,150
when they grow back,
it's quite unpleasant.

560
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,390
The grow back process,
like the itching and stuff,

561
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:23,050
you know,
there's something that happens when your

562
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,820
hair starts growing back when you're
like,

563
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:27,980
Hey,
I didn't think of this.

564
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,500
This isn't what I signed up.
Yeah.

565
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,940
But that's where I end.
I don't go through the legs,

566
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,280
but I'm not opposed to it.
It's not.

567
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,910
It seems to me like there's a problem
with why it's an issue,

568
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,140
you know,
like why is it an issue?

569
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,090
But I dunno,
there's something about,

570
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,700
is it a sexuality thing?
The Taboo?

571
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,291
Yeah.
Well,

572
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,180
why bring it,
bring it back to why is it okay to shave

573
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:52,520
your head?
Why is it okay to shave your face?

574
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,840
So get to shave all sorts and stuff.
But if you start shaving your armpits,

575
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,340
right?
Dudes that shave their armpits,

576
00:24:58,341 --> 00:24:59,174
like,
hey,

577
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,850
what's going on?
My shaving your armpits.

578
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,860
You know,
why not?

579
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,080
What do you like where you're like hairy
armpits.

580
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,860
What's wrong with shaving your armpits?
There is something though.

581
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,200
If your friend yawned and you're like,
hey dude,

582
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,650
where the fuck is your armpit hair?
It would be an issue.

583
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,300
Right?
He started calling me like,

584
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:20,470
hey man,
she makes armpits weird flux of doing

585
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,440
it.
You know?

586
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,720
I know dudes that shave their legs
though,

587
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,580
but they're like super into fitness and
they're like,

588
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,470
you know,
you shouldn't be like as you want your

589
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:28,291
legs look good.
Right?

590
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,001
Yeah.
Yeah.

591
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:30,470
You don't want to like big,
sloppy,

592
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,640
fucked up looking legs that are shaved
also.

593
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,280
Then you let highlight like if you have
like these big,

594
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,120
like blocky tree trunk,
sloppy legs,

595
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,880
you'd want to keep them Harry.
That he looked like some sort of a bear,

596
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,303
you know?

597
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

598
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:54,870
There's something about like,
okay,

599
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,050
here's another thing.
Shave your eyebrows.

600
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,550
You shave your eyebrows.
Like who the fuck shaved their eyebrows.

601
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:01,970
It's weird,
right?

602
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,230
If you decide to shave your eyebrows,
people gonna just go.

603
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,030
You one of those guys.
Meanwhile,

604
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:10,400
just a couple inches south.
You Shave your mustache.

605
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,950
Nobody gives a shit.
Totally normal.

606
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,750
Seemed totally normal.
There's something about shaving those

607
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:16,190
eyebrows,
right?

608
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,710
That's true.
Yeah.

609
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,710
Or if you left your mustache and shaved
your eyebrows,

610
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,470
get the fuck away from me.
Kind of a Weirdo.

611
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:26,600
Are you?
We have weird rules.

612
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,720
Um,
what was the weirdest name that you

613
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:34,180
heard anybody get other than smooth?
Where to begin?

614
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,100
Um,
fart master.

615
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,190
I think that it's pretty self
explanatory how it got that one.

616
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,800
Uh,
one of my favorites was I got a buddy of

617
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,260
mine hiked with for a while.
His name was hover

618
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,440
job hovered,
hovered job.

619
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,710
He went to,
um,

620
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,530
when you get out of it and it's like
most people aren't even that familiar

621
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:53,400
with the woods,
right?

622
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:57,690
So you start trying to figure out tips
and tricks on how to do things.

623
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:01,280
So one of the things is how to use the
public facilities and uh,

624
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,220
he was saying he,
you know,

625
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,350
he does the hover job.
Oh yeah.

626
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:05,580
That's a good move.
Yeah.

627
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:06,990
Everybody knows that one,
right?

628
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,660
We stopped at some gas station somewhere
and you gotta take a shit.

629
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,220
You have to be really careful.
Yeah.

630
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:12,930
You don't want to test the sets that
sleep.

631
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,250
Now,
speaking of ticks,

632
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:15,900
you were talking about ticks.
Um,

633
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,630
I know lyme disease is a huge issue on
the east coast.

634
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,660
I saw something nearly day that was
saying this year is going to be a record

635
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,940
year,
some walnut hatching season something

636
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:27,390
and I don't know,
it was terrifying stuff.

637
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,170
I did this show back a while back on the
cipher.

638
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,240
I called Joe Rogan questions everything.
And one of the,

639
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,720
one of the things we talked about was
mostly conspiracy theories and it was

640
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:41,050
really interesting to find the mindset
of these conspiracy people and how

641
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,510
they're all very similar,
whether it's big foot or aliens or what.

642
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,830
They're really similar,
sort of bizarre mindset that the way

643
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:53,380
they look at things,
they hit this very compartmentalized,

644
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,010
fucked up way of looking at things.
But one of the ones that we studied that

645
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,510
was really fascinating,
something called more Jaylen's,

646
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,820
more gentleman's is a weird disease
where people believe that they have

647
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:08,410
these fibers growing out of their skin
and they start itching themselves and

648
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:11,080
they create these like lead Gen z
scratches.

649
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,090
And then things get attached to them
like fibers from like perhaps from a

650
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:18,430
carpet or something like that.
And they think that they're growing out

651
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,070
of their skin.
And most people think it's a

652
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:24,460
psychosomatic disorder.
But one of the guys that I talked to was

653
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:29,461
a doctor who also had more Jones.
And he was really a very objective about

654
00:28:31,391 --> 00:28:34,600
it.
And he said there seems to be some sort

655
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,650
of a,
um,

656
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,210
neurotoxic effect that's connected to
lyme disease.

657
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,980
And he said that one of the things that
these people that have more gentleman's

658
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,160
have in common,
they almost all have lyme disease.

659
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:53,410
And what he believes is that ticks
contain not just lyme disease,

660
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,320
but a host of other different sort of,
uh,

661
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,910
diseases that you can catch.
And so because of these weird different

662
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,650
bacterias and different things that
these toxins that these ticks

663
00:29:08,651 --> 00:29:13,360
potentially possess,
when you get bit by certain ticks,

664
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,530
you can actually hallucinate.
And he would say,

665
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,330
yeah,
he was talking about and we saw a thread

666
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,430
moving across his eyeball.

667
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,980
Wait,
this is real stuff.

668
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,120
That's of stuff.
No,

669
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,331
no,
no,

670
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:25,560
no.
It's not sy stuff at all.

671
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:27,430
It's real.
People never even heard of this.

672
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,660
Yeah.
Well it's generally thought to be a

673
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:33,000
psychosomatic disorder.
And that's why it was interesting

674
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:37,320
talking to this doctor because he was
saying yes and no because he was saying,

675
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:39,420
well there isn't.
He believes there's a real issue and

676
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:43,600
that issue is lyme disease,
but that these pathogens that are in

677
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:45,070
these ticks,
they,

678
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,000
they're,
they're not,

679
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,340
it's not uniform.
There are different in all these

680
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:50,890
different ticks.
Some of them are more potent than others

681
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,920
and that there may be a host of
different unidentified pathogenesis.

682
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,250
There's not just lyme disease,
but several others.

683
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:01,930
And some of them have a neurotoxic
effect and this neurotoxic effect can

684
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:05,440
induce hallucinations.
And some of those hallucinations can be

685
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:08,440
that you think that your body's growing
fibers out of it.

686
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,810
And he,
he said that he saw it moving across.

687
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:13,540
Is it he goes,
I know intellectually that it was not

688
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:14,140
there.

689
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,100
He goes,
there was no,

690
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:17,530
I examined it.
I looked at it was not there,

691
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:20,620
but I saw it.
Is that he personally experienced the

692
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,210
notion.
Yeah.

693
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,920
And the other thing is a lot of these
people,

694
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:28,810
they go undiagnosed for long periods of
time because for the longest time a lyme

695
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:32,290
disease went undiagnosed and still does.
I have a good buddy of mine,

696
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:36,850
him and his son got bit by ticks when
they were fishing.

697
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,610
And uh,
he brought his son to the doctor.

698
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:41,380
And by then that bullseye,
you know,

699
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,650
around that grows or if you get bit by a
tick that has lyme disease,

700
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:48,310
there's like a bullseye.
It looks like the red circle that grows

701
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,570
around the area where the tick bit,
him and the Bulls.

702
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:53,800
I had gone away by the time he brought
him to the doctor.

703
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,630
So the doctor was incredulous and he's
like,

704
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,050
no,
I don't,

705
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,100
I don't believe that's lyme disease.

706
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,770
Kids from refined and then he started
getting bell's Palsy.

707
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:03,290
So half of his face was paralyzed and
that's when they really realized that

708
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:03,851
this,
Oh my God,

709
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:06,420
this kid has lyme disease for sure.
And then yeah.

710
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,530
And they were,
they were in real bad shape.

711
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,670
Like my friend who was skinny as it is,
he wound up losing something like 20,

712
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,750
30 pounds and it fucked with him for
close to a year.

713
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,460
The other guys that he was with,
uh,

714
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,640
they got lyme disease as well as several
people that were with got lyme disease

715
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:26,641
and they were all fucked up for months.
I knew one guy that got it and I think

716
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:31,150
he went to the doctor and got some shots
or antibiotics.

717
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:33,910
I don't know what the treatment was,
but he came back like full force and

718
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:35,100
finished the two.
Yeah,

719
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,750
you can't do that if you get,
if you get catch it,

720
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:38,680
like really clearly.

721
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,690
We had a guy on the podcast,
Steve,

722
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,940
Steve Kotler,
who got it,

723
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:47,080
and he was undiagnosed for over a year
and he wound up being bedridden for

724
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:49,720
three years.
Oh my gosh.

725
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:50,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

726
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,020
Because the more it sinks into your
system,

727
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,280
the more you let it go or without
antibiotics,

728
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,260
without treatment.
And again,

729
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,460
with this doctor was telling me just
relaying what this one doctor who had

730
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:06,820
lyme disease was saying is that he
believes that there's a host of

731
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:09,390
different pathogens.
There's not just one and he,

732
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,100
he,
he said there could be many that are

733
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:15,490
undiscovered.
Like lyme disease is fairly recent in

734
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:18,460
terms of its discovery or our diagnosis
of it.

735
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,820
I feel like it's within the last two or
three decades at the most,

736
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,750
so I would worry about that.
We're out there.

737
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,050
The risk of the lyme disease on the
Appalachian trail is going to be high

738
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:30,580
this year.
Trail life.

739
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,250
Oh my God.
How do you retrain life when you're out

740
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,140
there?
You don't even have started.

741
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,260
Oh,
just came out today though.

742
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,780
Oh Shit.
They're talking about touching.

743
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,220
I didn't say that.
There was another

744
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,360
article and I googled lyme disease from
Connecticut that says that the testing

745
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:47,240
on found ticks with lyme disease is
higher this year,

746
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:50,220
more than normal for last year.
And repeat,

747
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,000
you get bitten when you go

748
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,240
flooding.
You can,

749
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,980
I mean,
I'm really careful,

750
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,670
real careful to check myself.
Also real careful to keep myself covered

751
00:32:58,671 --> 00:32:59,560
up,
you know,

752
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,310
I wear gators.
I wear,

753
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:02,300
um,
you know,

754
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:05,780
a long,
like a Merino wool that goes all the way

755
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:09,260
down to my ankles and then I pull the
Merino wool socks way up over that.

756
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:13,460
I don't have any exposed up to my wrists
and I even wore gloves sometimes even in

757
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:17,420
the heat aware,
like a thin layer glove just to all also

758
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:21,650
it's good to protect your hands from the
sun but also to protect your hands from

759
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:24,610
the animals.
Seeing that white skin like you want a

760
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,590
little white as you can that's exposed.
But um,

761
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:33,170
I think about that primarily about ticks
scares the shit out of me.

762
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:33,920
Yeah.

763
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,190
Oh,
I wonder what percentage of ticks

764
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,450
actually carry because I feel like I've
probably been bitten by ticks in my

765
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,280
life.
You know,

766
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,113
some like,

767
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:44,430
I don't know what percent of the job I
got bit by a bunch when I was a kid,

768
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,670
um,
but I never got line but wasn't around

769
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:51,150
that much when I was a kid.
There was a thing about the New York

770
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,470
upper New York state area being
unbelievably infested.

771
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,010
Have you ever seen a lyme disease map?
Like a map of lyme disease infestation

772
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:01,920
in the northeast,
big time and this huge,

773
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,950
huge,
huge in the northeast and huge in New

774
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,520
York state like that upper New York
state area.

775
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,190
Just really,
really devastating.

776
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,040
I wonder whether that isn't related to
most.

777
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,460
I don't know.
Deer,

778
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,510
deer,
deer,

779
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,460
deer,
ticks apparently are a big issue.

780
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,990
Here it is.
Look at that.

781
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,600
There you go.
No,

782
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,850
it's the 2015,
but there's a few in California,

783
00:34:23,851 --> 00:34:26,250
especially northern California has a
bunch,

784
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,990
but look at that fucking ne Man.
That's just like a Zombie plague.

785
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,900
That's awful.
Massachusetts is completely covered in

786
00:34:33,901 --> 00:34:34,734
it.
Look at it.

787
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,620
The whole street.
New Jersey to covered.

788
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:43,020
Yeah,
but I'm just a devastating disease if

789
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:45,870
you don't catch it,
but guess it's spreading across the

790
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:47,970
country.
They're finding it in Florida now,

791
00:34:47,971 --> 00:34:52,860
new strains in Florida.
What other issues do you have to deal

792
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:56,160
with when it comes to like bugs and
diseases and stuff like that?

793
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,363
Grd.
Uh,

794
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,680
oh yeah.
So what.

795
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,610
Yeah,
I was gonna ask you that.

796
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,890
How do you,
how do you get your water?

797
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,753
Like what are you getting?

798
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,480
There's a thing called,
um,

799
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,500
basically you all freshwater water
sources,

800
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,420
so streams,
lakes,

801
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:13,480
ponds.
Um,

802
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,080
unfortunately the east coast is,
it's so wet,

803
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:19,050
you know,
you're going to crossover water source

804
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:21,840
very frequently.
Generally several times a day you're

805
00:35:21,841 --> 00:35:24,630
going to cross at least a stream.
So you fill up your water there.

806
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,720
Uh,
you carry two different containers to

807
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,150
two bottles,
one for dirty,

808
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:31,710
one for clean.
Uh,

809
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:34,530
so you fill up a leader of nerdy water
from the stream.

810
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,300
I'm a ton of different water methods.
I don't know if you do it in your back

811
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:40,920
country hunting,
but um,

812
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,770
the big one I use with saw your squeeze.
It's like a,

813
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,930
a nozzle.
You screw on top of your,

814
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:47,640
uh,
your water bottles he feel but dirty

815
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:51,240
water bottle.
Screw this water filter off and you

816
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,940
squeeze out clean water.
So that's what I used.

817
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,190
But I mean a lot of really works that
well.

818
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,560
You just squeeze it in.
The water comes out clean.

819
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,330
Yeah.
The filtration system,

820
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:01,650
is that good?
Yeah.

821
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,490
And it takes out Giardia.
Yes.

822
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:09,960
I think that kind of still standing.
But uh,

823
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,300
yeah.
And then they're like the droplets which

824
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:15,390
are basically a Columbian chemicals.
Right.

825
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:17,040
You know?
Um,

826
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,821
yeah.
I mean,

827
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:20,580
what else is there?
All sorts of filters and chemicals.

828
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:22,500
Some people try to boil it.
That's just a pain.

829
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,650
You don't want to boil water all the
time and then wait for it to cool down

830
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:26,580
before you get drink it.
Yeah.

831
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:28,170
I will say though,
by the end of the,

832
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,430
you talk about finishing and winter,
um,

833
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,090
you know,
it's like whenever you stop at these

834
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,200
freshwater sources,
you know,

835
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:37,020
the water's flowing and I'm,
you know,

836
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:39,480
it's like 20 degrees out,
15 degrees,

837
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:39,991
you know,
I'm like,

838
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:44,460
I don't want to stick my hand in that
freezing water and get my hands cold.

839
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,870
I can't hit them back up,
you know.

840
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,580
Um,
so I'll,

841
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:50,010
it admittedly,
not that I recommend this,

842
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,110
but I was,
I was drinking it straight,

843
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:53,230
man.
Wow.

844
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,660
Yeah,
that's risky.

845
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,450
It was risky,
but it was just like I was so done by

846
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:58,171
the end of it,
you know,

847
00:36:58,171 --> 00:37:02,460
it's just like a,
I don't have the patients to stop with

848
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:03,690
freezing fingers,
like,

849
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,650
so numb,
you know,

850
00:37:04,651 --> 00:37:07,220
the dexterity is just totally gone,
you know,

851
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,250
I'm like was just like,
wow.

852
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,560
So I'll see a doctor eventually.
And uh,

853
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,260
now when you,
when you got to the end seven months,

854
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,330
is that what it took you?
I think it was,

855
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,140
I got up trail for two weeks in between
there for some family stuff.

856
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:27,840
But uh,
if you took out that two weeks,

857
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:29,730
it was six months.
I was on trail.

858
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,090
So when you get off trail,
did you go fly somewhere?

859
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,640
Honestly,
I went to France with my family.

860
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,770
Whoa,
that's not,

861
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,400
doesn't count dude.
I.

862
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,850
And it was like,
oh,

863
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,260
just a human trash can.
I was just like cheese,

864
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,600
wine,
everything that I like I gained.

865
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,660
I gained at least five,
10 pounds that week and I was just like,

866
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,290
wow,
just pigging out showing joint the

867
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,780
shuttle.
That vacation though.

868
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,670
It was Kinda like that.
It was like,

869
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:58,160
you know,
a lot of guys are getting up jokes.

870
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,003
They're like,
Oh man,

871
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,150
I'm totally broken.
Everything,

872
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,060
like I'm going to France for a week or
two.

873
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,500
So some people get off trail just
because financially they can't hack it

874
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:08,281
anymore.
Yeah,

875
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:11,640
I mean you got a 19 year old guy who's
at a high school.

876
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:12,870
It doesn't have any savings.
It's like,

877
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,780
oh,
I'm going to go ahead with a two.

878
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:16,140
Sounds like a great idea.
They haven't done any research,

879
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:18,600
no planning,
don't know anything about gear or

880
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:19,650
anything,
but you know,

881
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,110
they've read a walk in the woods.

882
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,970
Um,
and I think this is a good idea.

883
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,760
It is a walk in the woods by Bill
Bryson.

884
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:29,070
It's probably the most popular book out
there.

885
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:29,904
It's like,
um,

886
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,600
it's just kind of a funny story.
He's a good writer.

887
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,890
Um,
but he wrote that I in like the mid

888
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:37,300
nineties.
But that book,

889
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,000
if you look at like the Appalachian
trail hikers,

890
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,101
it was just like put,
bup,

891
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:41,371
bup,
bup,

892
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:41,681
bup,
bup,

893
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:43,390
bup,
a walk in the woods is released.

894
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:44,810
I was like,
wow.

895
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:48,460
It was like huge publicity.
And if you heard of wild the book movie,

896
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,323
Reese Witherspoon.

897
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:51,880
No,
I,

898
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,070
yeah,
I did hear about it.

899
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:54,270
I never saw it.
But yeah,

900
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,280
that was,
was that a movie about the Appalachian

901
00:38:56,281 --> 00:38:57,540
trail?
Pacific crest trail.

902
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,100
But it's,
that was the same thing.

903
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:03,240
It was like the eighties is so historic
and iconic for long distance hiking

904
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:07,650
trails that a walk in the woods did for
the 80 what wilde did for the Pacific

905
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:11,040
crest trail.
But wild is only released a few years

906
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,640
ago.
Um,

907
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,840
but I mean,
same thing,

908
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,080
it's like Pacific crest trail was
relatively unknown to hikers and that

909
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:20,430
book was released and an movie and it
was just like now Pacific crest trail is

910
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:24,600
really hot right now.
The Pacific crest trail though is the

911
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:28,680
one that goes from Mexico to California
and it goes all the way to Canada.

912
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,280
Oh,
okay.

913
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,550
Yeah,
yeah.

914
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,090
Top.
There's not that much water there.

915
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,211
No.
Right.

916
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:34,590
You talked about the east coast being
wet.

917
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,170
I think so what do they do there?
Uh,

918
00:39:37,171 --> 00:39:39,080
my understanding is they have big,
um,

919
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,810
I don't know the terminology is a big
water reservoir,

920
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:46,740
like a big concrete cylinder out in the
middle of the,

921
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:50,660
uh,
of the desert and I don't know if it's

922
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,550
rain water or if somebody actually goes
out there and fills it up,

923
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,800
kind,
kinda like a trail trail.

924
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:58,110
Angel kind of goes out there and trail
angel.

925
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,140
That's another term to trail angel
take.

926
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,200
We'll take it.
We'll take a sidestep into.

927
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:10,290
It's just a trend is going to educate us
on the trail.

928
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,130
Angel,
go ahead.

929
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:11,963
Smooth.
All right.

930
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:12,570
Yeah,
we'll get,

931
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,880
we'll get an 18 dictionary going.
Um,

932
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,870
but yeah,
the trail angels in that term was um,

933
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,150
when you're hiking and eat,
you come to towns and you're like,

934
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,000
uh,
I need transportation to the grocery

935
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:27,030
store.
The grocery store is actually 10 miles

936
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:28,770
away from the trail crossing.
Like,

937
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:30,870
okay,
does that mean a hike 10 more miles down

938
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:34,110
the highway to get some groceries?
Then 10 more miles back.

939
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:35,100
No,
you hitchhike.

940
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,590
And then you hitchhike in town.
That's kind of that,

941
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,920
that person then becomes a trail angel.
Whoa.

942
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,980
But hitchhiking is fucking dangerous.
Have you ever done it?

943
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,950
Um,
maybe in the younger days.

944
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,840
Trying to think.

945
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,760
I definitely got rides from people when
my car broke down in,

946
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:57,110
in Massachusetts,
but I don't think I actually hitchhiked

947
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,630
like that was desperation without
intent.

948
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:02,300
Like I'm going to get a ride from
somebody.

949
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,230
No,
I never.

950
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:06,200
I never went out there and put my thumb
out and said I'm going to get from here

951
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:08,180
to there by hitchhiking.
Never do that.

952
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,040
You did?
Yeah,

953
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:12,910
you did.
You're,

954
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,590
you're a fairly young guy.
How old are you?

955
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,450
Twenty eight.
Twenty eight.

956
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:17,140
Yeah.
Okay.

957
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,920
So you're talking about within the last
10 years you hitchhiked a fair amount.

958
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,680
That's fucking crazy.
That's like when people already know

959
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,450
that hitchhiking is a good way to kill
folks.

960
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,500
Like if you want to kill somebody,
what do you kill some fucking kid with a

961
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,820
backpack.
That's the move,

962
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,600
right?
It's a great opportunity to kill or

963
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,070
above.
You're going to be one of those

964
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,370
Psychos,
you know?

965
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:41,470
I would just assume yeah,
everybody was pretty nice.

966
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:43,760
You know,
it's different parts of the country too,

967
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,560
you know,
like if you're going to go hitchhiking

968
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,430
in like New York,
you're gonna run into some really weird

969
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:51,140
people if you're like just outside of
Manhattan,

970
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,370
you got,
you thaw them out and you try and get

971
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,890
picked up.
You might get picked up by a fucking

972
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:58,340
complete psycho.
But if you're in Wyoming or something

973
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:00,980
and there's like no one out there and
you're hiking and

974
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,080
like rural Alabama,
Pennsylvania,

975
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:07,610
those crack heads screaming at each
other,

976
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,110
every other weirdos everywhere.
But will say like,

977
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,930
ah.
So before the [inaudible] in New Zealand

978
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:15,830
and New Zealand is higher standard of
living in the states and I feel like

979
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,530
you,
there's very low crime right there.

980
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,250
And hitchhiking is not taboo there.
I always heard that New Zealand was kind

981
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:26,470
of like the states,
uh,

982
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,090
was in the fifties and it was just like
Kinda like a,

983
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:31,580
a safe,
happy place,

984
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:32,780
you know,
there's no crime.

985
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,000
Everybody's nice to each other.
High standard of living.

986
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,530
And in New Zealand it was like they had
um,

987
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,840
some bus stops,
like the equivalent of like a bus stop.

988
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:46,310
And it was like a hitchhiking bench,
so you would sit there and like people

989
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:49,310
would drive on their way to work and
somebody will be sitting on the bench

990
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,420
like,
Hey,

991
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,210
pick me up,
you know?

992
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,790
But it's like systemized,
you know,

993
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,850
it's like people have hitchhike.
So it was like that.

994
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,770
The taboo was kind of broken in New
Zealand.

995
00:42:57,771 --> 00:42:59,090
It was like,
this is normal,

996
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:02,180
people are,
it's an economical,

997
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:03,590
it's efficient.
Like why not,

998
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,780
you know,
but

999
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,340
it's not something I would ever do.
But man,

1000
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:11,810
I remember I got my car,
my car broke down once in a snow storm

1001
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,810
and these people took me back to their
house and they were so normal.

1002
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,740
They were really normal people and they
made me that.

1003
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:22,741
I was on my way to visit my girlfriend
and her mom and her drove to get me at

1004
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:27,230
these people's house and I was in there.
I was driving up there and we just got

1005
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:29,390
caught in a freak snowstorm car broke
down.

1006
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,330
And I remember thinking like,
what kind of person?

1007
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:35,400
Just pick someone up and takes them to
their how they're so nice.

1008
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,740
Let's be a Weirdo.
But no,

1009
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,020
they were really nice,
they were really nice people.

1010
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,940
They just took a chance,
you know,

1011
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,010
I guess the fear comes from that like
point,

1012
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:43,880
oh,
one percent,

1013
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:45,390
right.
That's going to do something with like a

1014
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,920
vast majority or you know,
why not?

1015
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,650
I'm just looking to help somebody out.
It was like something with like airbnb.

1016
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:52,970
There was that fear.
It was like,

1017
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,740
oh,
there's no way I could let somebody come

1018
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:58,040
into my house or couchsurfing.
Couchsurfing is,

1019
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:58,893
it's like,
um,

1020
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,270
airbnb for free.
Essentially.

1021
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,810
You put up your couch on this website
and you offer.

1022
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,960
Um,
yeah,

1023
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:08,930
see,
like I've got a couch,

1024
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:10,590
does anybody want to stay on it?
And then you say,

1025
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,150
I'm coming through on these dates and
your request the couch for free.

1026
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,100
But it's like,
remember that when that website was

1027
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,260
really becoming popular about 10 years
ago,

1028
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:19,580
people had that same idea.
I was like,

1029
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,000
no way.
This is only for nutjobs.

1030
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:26,150
Like it's hugely popular now.
And airbnb and all that stuff's like,

1031
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:28,180
yeah,
let somebody come and stay in your house

1032
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,300
and meet travelers.
Share authentic travel experiences as

1033
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:35,100
opposed to what?
Fake travel experiences.

1034
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,170
Fuck,
does that mean authentic?

1035
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,910
Meet New People,
explore the world,

1036
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,840
go on a rape binge,
find a couch.

1037
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,460
I'll find a host.
There's a couch.

1038
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:49,920
Is a graphic of a couch.
So this is.

1039
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,330
What is this?
What is this website?

1040
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,130
Jamie?
Couchsurfing.com.

1041
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,080
Yeah.
What?

1042
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,930
But that's what's crazy is that somebody
decided to organize this.

1043
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,960
They decided to make a website.
Every year we support 400,000 hosts,

1044
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,850
4 million surfers.
I love.

1045
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:08,760
I call them surfers.
Isn't imaginary or real surfer.

1046
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:09,690
And you heard this like,
listen,

1047
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:13,290
bitch fucking surf or you don't even
have to balance your laying down some

1048
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:17,340
dudes couch hundred thousand events.
They support a 100,000 events.

1049
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,200
This is crazy.
I never knew about this.

1050
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,110
Yeah,
I mean they're also like niche websites

1051
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:23,830
that have another one.
Uh,

1052
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,830
scroll down Jamie.
That image.

1053
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,420
Warm showers is another one.
That's first cyclists.

1054
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,060
Look at that guy like updating the top
of the world.

1055
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,000
Ready for your next adventure.
Planet trip.

1056
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,420
Stay on my couch.
It's very strange in Paris.

1057
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:44,421
You can go surf and look in Paris you've
got find food and wine and cheese and

1058
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:47,190
bread.
You can afford that.

1059
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,070
You can't afford a fucking hotel room.
Let's see.

1060
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,280
That's like a fucking expensive meal
right there.

1061
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,230
Looking at some really delicious food.
It's very,

1062
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:57,960
uh,
strange because it's a very

1063
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:01,350
romanticized,
like this is really organized.

1064
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,680
This website's super well done.
Local hosts and they have avatars of

1065
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:09,120
images,
reviews.

1066
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,830
Oh my God,
look,

1067
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,570
it's Louis joined couchsurfing to see
loses full profile.

1068
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:20,280
It's free
about me.

1069
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,180
Current mission.
Can I host one person only?

1070
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,920
Wow.
This is weird.

1071
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,690
You can put your ketchup.
Do.

1072
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,980
Nope.
That's not gonna happen.

1073
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:30,930
But it is interesting.

1074
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:35,930
I mean it's like,
it's the good aspects of it are,

1075
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,820
I'm sure far outweigh the negatives.
You know,

1076
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,790
most people are just enjoying
themselves.

1077
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:45,210
Meeting nice people,
meeting like minded people,

1078
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,390
traveling around.
Like my feet are obviously humor aside,

1079
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:52,530
but my fears are probably fairly
unfounded.

1080
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,710
Right.
But isn't that kind of how it is with

1081
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:58,320
life like most,
most people that you meet,

1082
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,490
like the vast majority of people are
really pretty nice.

1083
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,900
Like this is all intention.
It's a really safe time to be a person,

1084
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,243
you know?
I mean,

1085
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:12,690
almost all interactions you have with
people on a daily basis are safe and

1086
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:15,660
fairly friendly.
Even like rude people are like,

1087
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:16,441
well,
what's the big deal?

1088
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:17,920
They say a word,
you know,

1089
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:19,710
like most.
Yeah.

1090
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,890
Most.
Almost nothing happens most of the time,

1091
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,930
but we're so obsessed with the news
where you tune into any news channel,

1092
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,960
all you're getting is the collective bad
news of 7 billion people because that's

1093
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:34,264
what sells.

1094
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,460
If it bleeds,
it leads run with it.

1095
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,350
Mike.
Mike runs with it.

1096
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:39,821
Yeah.
You know,

1097
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:42,100
I mean this is,
that's actually a very.

1098
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,290
When you really look at it that way,
that's a very positive trend that people

1099
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:50,290
are doing this hosting,
hosting people,

1100
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:53,670
shared shared economy.
What's this?

1101
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,090
That's really nice.
You know,

1102
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,850
it's nice that people will offer up
their couch for free.

1103
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,790
Yeah,
it's good stuff.

1104
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,810
It is good stuff.
So do you ever stop and think like what

1105
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:09,490
if I hadn't gone on this journey of
exploration and I stayed in the

1106
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:14,491
accountant and you would be living that
life of the droning existence where

1107
00:48:16,031 --> 00:48:19,900
every day he just fucking Sean over the
same place,

1108
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:24,760
crunching numbers and hating life and
wishing for some kind of adventure,

1109
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:28,340
something different.
No,

1110
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,910
I can't,
I can't relate to.

1111
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:33,150
I think no matter what,
whether it's 80 or something,

1112
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,440
I think I would have,
you know,

1113
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,150
I'm too impatient,
you know,

1114
00:48:36,151 --> 00:48:38,180
I get bored too easily.
Something,

1115
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,014
you know,
I would have done something

1116
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,410
then a lot of people don't.
A lot of people are like you and they

1117
00:48:42,411 --> 00:48:44,150
just never make that move.
They never,

1118
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,680
they never take that chance.

1119
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,360
So yeah,
I think when I talked to even a lot of

1120
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:50,660
my friends that are still doing,
I'm not going to call them crappy jobs,

1121
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,760
but you know,
because I think they do provide a lot of

1122
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:53,900
things that they like,
you know,

1123
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:54,830
security.
You can't.

1124
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,470
Some people love that security,
getting a paycheck,

1125
00:48:57,471 --> 00:48:59,000
you know?
Um,

1126
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,000
but it's like,
I don't think they view it like that.

1127
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:02,541
It's not like,
oh,

1128
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:04,310
this may not be the best thing,
but I like it,

1129
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:05,450
you know,
it's not like A.

1130
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,650
I don't know.
It's like some people think this is so

1131
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:11,300
bad or I,
I just can't.

1132
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:12,770
I just have to like,
I just don't think that,

1133
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,170
that,
that threshold ever crosses most people,

1134
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:15,960
you know?

1135
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,250
Yeah.
Well,

1136
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,930
you know,
people very,

1137
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:22,320
you know,
the personality types that go on that

1138
00:49:22,321 --> 00:49:24,150
trail.
I mean that's like a very,

1139
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:28,950
very extreme personality type,
but I think most people have a certain

1140
00:49:28,951 --> 00:49:31,060
amount of,
if not wanderlust,

1141
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,650
at least curiosity.
It's just a matter of how much of it do

1142
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:36,780
you,
how much of it do you nurture?

1143
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,800
How much of,
how much of that that needed to feed

1144
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:42,150
this.
Also,

1145
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,420
there's also a real problem than not
recognizing the finite nature of

1146
00:49:45,421 --> 00:49:47,040
existence.
You know,

1147
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:50,940
I mean just when you're 20 especially or
21 or whatever it is,

1148
00:49:50,941 --> 00:49:54,210
when you enter into these jobs you don't
realize like,

1149
00:49:54,211 --> 00:49:57,630
hey man,
you've only got like a few decades.

1150
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,550
Right?
Have a good time.

1151
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,910
You could do this for 40 years easily.
Oh,

1152
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:04,020
easily,
easily.

1153
00:50:04,021 --> 00:50:08,400
And then we've all met those people that
have done it for 40 years and they just

1154
00:50:08,401 --> 00:50:11,070
beaten down by life and they have that
dull,

1155
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:15,030
desperate look in their eyes.
It's just the sadness in their eyes

1156
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,550
where their life is just.
It's not,

1157
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,890
it's not good.
It hasn't turned out well.

1158
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,760
There's not a lot of joy there.
Yeah.

1159
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,760
And hold onto the vacations.
Big Time.

1160
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,640
You're scaring the shit out of me,
Chris.

1161
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:27,980
Scaring the shit out

1162
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,040
of me.
So you in the middle of doing all this,

1163
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,270
right?
So you do this,

1164
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:36,410
you go on this crazy seven month
adventure and when it's over,

1165
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,070
what was that like when you,
when you hit the end and you realize

1166
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,600
they're like a bell,
you ring or anything like that.

1167
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,300
She put a bell up there.
So going north,

1168
00:50:45,301 --> 00:50:46,500
but there's,
there's like,

1169
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:51,000
there's like this epic Mountain Qatada
and it's like a beautiful big mountain.

1170
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,080
I'm one of the,
like the most epic climbs that's in

1171
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:56,850
Maine.
So if you go south,

1172
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,580
you end in Georgia and you end on
Springer Mountain,

1173
00:50:59,581 --> 00:51:01,950
which is just not as,
not as that,

1174
00:51:01,951 --> 00:51:03,120
but God is dramatic.
You know,

1175
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:03,691
you're right.
So,

1176
00:51:03,691 --> 00:51:04,980
but yeah,
I mean you finish it,

1177
00:51:04,981 --> 00:51:06,930
there's just a plaque and it's like,
dude,

1178
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,270
you finished really?
And you touch the plaque,

1179
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:11,490
you have to touch it.
What does he get right before and you

1180
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:14,280
quit right before like a flint before
the fuck this.

1181
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,560
Just gloves for the plan.
Yeah,

1182
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,510
that's it.
So that's good.

1183
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:19,260
That's the main.

1184
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,540
That's the,
that's the finish and finish.

1185
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,530
And uh,
yeah,

1186
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,500
north bounders.
How many people fake it?

1187
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,150
Take a picture of that dude.
Dude,

1188
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,520
you can go hike that in one day.
Yeah,

1189
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,190
for sure.
It's usually,

1190
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,770
at least I would probably do that.
I'd go hike it in a day and then get

1191
00:51:34,771 --> 00:51:39,771
that weird feeling of watching these
people that are covered in two inches of

1192
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:42,330
grime.
Climb up that hill.

1193
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,720
Can you pull up spraying that guy?
That motherfucker.

1194
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,310
Look at that guy.
That guy looks like he's been hiking for

1195
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:51,810
seven months.
Hecker Springer Mountain.

1196
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,080
Look at that guy's face.
Jesus Christ.

1197
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,740
He's just all hair.
And

1198
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,120
so,
um,

1199
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:00,960
there you go.
Yeah,

1200
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,690
that's the uh,
that's where it starts.

1201
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:05,100
Is that the gateway?
That's,

1202
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,470
that's what's called the approach trail.
It's not the,

1203
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,260
I'm like,
well I kinda has like a,

1204
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,690
an on.
That's the actual plaque on the end,

1205
00:52:12,691 --> 00:52:15,530
but that's not a great shot of it.
There you go to.

1206
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,900
So that's where it starts.
Yep.

1207
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,860
National scenic trail.
Now who established this?

1208
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,070
Uh,
so the kind of in Benton Benton,

1209
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:29,040
MCI.
I'm trying to talk people into doing

1210
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,530
that with you.
Like when you first started doing that,

1211
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:33,630
like what year did this guy do this?

1212
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,430
I know I know these dates,
but I don't think they can guarantee 30

1213
00:52:39,431 --> 00:52:41,430
days.
So imagine 19 thirties.

1214
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,930
Fucking great depression that all deal.
Those are the people back then and this

1215
00:52:45,931 --> 00:52:47,120
guy says,
I know what do,

1216
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,310
I'm going to walk all the way up to
Maine and I'm going to start a whole

1217
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:52,320
movement.
A bunch of other people going to do as

1218
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,550
well.
Like,

1219
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,610
fuck you dude.
And get a job.

1220
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:57,241
Hippie.
Yeah.

1221
00:52:57,241 --> 00:53:00,080
The CCC at the time was helping
construct all the uh,

1222
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:03,690
the trails at that Springer Mountain,
Georgia.

1223
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:06,780
Eight point five miles mount.
How to say it?

1224
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:12,230
Catoctin catoctin main 2000.
One hundred and eight point five miles.

1225
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,930
Those point five or a motherfucker that
last point five.

1226
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,320
Oh,
so when you did it and you touch the

1227
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,670
sign and you're like,
all right,

1228
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,320
I did it.
I cried.

1229
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,550
Did you?
I did.

1230
00:53:23,551 --> 00:53:24,870
I literally clubs.

1231
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,390
Wow.
Well you failed you knees.

1232
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,040
It was like,
it was seriously one of the most

1233
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:31,230
emotional times in my life.
I couldn't imagine.

1234
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,220
I was just,
yeah.

1235
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:34,380
Even even like that morning I woke up
and I was just like,

1236
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,210
oh my gosh,
this is,

1237
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,200
this is ending,
you know,

1238
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,540
it was like so much,
just so long.

1239
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,720
I had been thinking about it from.
Yeah,

1240
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,140
I mean childhood,
you know,

1241
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:46,170
and then it was like not only thinking
about it for a decade,

1242
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,400
but then it was actually hiking the darn
thing for six months and it was just

1243
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:51,820
like getting there.
But that time,

1244
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:54,960
like I had stress fractures forming and
my feet and uh,

1245
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,760
yeah,
I was just in bad shape.

1246
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:58,220
I wasn't sleeping well because,
you know,

1247
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,310
at night it was going to get into zero
degrees every night and my sleeping bag

1248
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:03,630
was not cutting it.

1249
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:06,450
So it's just like,
it was just a lot man,

1250
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,610
you know,
stress fractures in your feet,

1251
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:09,890
huh?
Yeah,

1252
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:10,670
yeah.
Yeah.

1253
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:12,780
And I,
I've had had stress fractures from cross

1254
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:15,190
country in high school,
so I knew what they felt like,

1255
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,141
oh,
this is coming.

1256
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:17,370
It's just a matter of time,
you know.

1257
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,040
Now what kind of hiking shoes did you
wear?

1258
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,370
Okay.
We,

1259
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,130
it seems like your gear would be
critical big time.

1260
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,570
Yeah.
Uh,

1261
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,630
I started off with a brand called
Selayla.

1262
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,150
They were kind of like a technical
climbing shoe actually,

1263
00:54:30,151 --> 00:54:32,190
but um,
the fact that they are a little more

1264
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,260
stiff,
stiff,

1265
00:54:34,261 --> 00:54:35,140
exactly.
Um,

1266
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,830
makes them good for some tough,
tough trail.

1267
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,270
But uh,
I switched to a trail runners and I

1268
00:54:41,271 --> 00:54:42,630
don't do run.
Yeah,

1269
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:44,460
I started reading really,
really recently,

1270
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:46,140
like a few days.
I think I saw you post something on

1271
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:46,980
facebook.
You had a rough,

1272
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,840
a rough run,
fucking terrible at it.

1273
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:53,070
A bit like a bowling ball.
It's not good for running some weight,

1274
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:54,330
want to keep doing this.
But yeah,

1275
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:56,430
I've been running for a few days now.
But uh,

1276
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:58,270
yeah,
I switched to um,

1277
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,960
basically just running shoes with the
little thicker tread,

1278
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:04,060
like Solomon's Solomon's is a great
brand.

1279
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,800
I got those for the very purpose of
running up hills.

1280
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:08,970
You like them?
Yeah,

1281
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,220
it seemed good.
They've got good traction to them.

1282
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,270
Could tread like a thick tread,
but yet there are still built like a

1283
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:17,670
running shoe.
It was a good hiking shoes.

1284
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:21,030
Something that you can breathe and give
you some cushion and you don't need any

1285
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:21,930
ankle support,
you know,

1286
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,430
feel.
I feel like that's overrated

1287
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,590
mountaineering thing.
Yeah.

1288
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:28,110
I think there's kind of this theory that
your ankles toughened up.

1289
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,170
Um,
I don't know if that's really true,

1290
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:35,040
but I think I kind of fell into that
belief that I was rolling ankles so much

1291
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:37,560
in the first 100,
200 miles of the trail and by the end of

1292
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:41,070
it was just like,
just keep going,

1293
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:41,820
you know?

1294
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,110
Yeah,
yeah.

1295
00:55:43,111 --> 00:55:44,640
Well,
I've always wondered about that because

1296
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:48,750
a lot of people that hunt,
they were these like really stiff,

1297
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,140
very tactical mountain hiking boots
where they,

1298
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,290
uh,
they go out that,

1299
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,150
you know,
they go like 10 inches up the ankle and

1300
00:55:57,151 --> 00:55:59,250
they lace them up tight.
Yeah.

1301
00:55:59,251 --> 00:56:02,400
I say when I used to go hunting with my
dad when I was a kid and we would,

1302
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,440
we would wear those boots and uh,
looking back I'm like,

1303
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,291
Eh,
I don't get it.

1304
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:09,330
And is it just because maybe the brush
is just so thick you need something like

1305
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,820
durable to cross through that brush.
It's like,

1306
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,990
I don't think so.
What do you mean?

1307
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,320
What do you wear when you go hunting?
Well,

1308
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,050
it varies.
I've never worn.

1309
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,320
I'm running shoes like those,
like trail running shoes,

1310
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:25,850
but I know some people do do,
do wear those and they like them and

1311
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,950
some really good hunters.

1312
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,620
They were them exclusively.
There were like lightweight trail

1313
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:33,430
runners and they,
and even Solomon actually makes a gator

1314
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,260
for those trail runners so that you can,
for people to know what a gator is.

1315
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:43,180
Gators like a thing that you slip over
your shoes and it cinches down tight so

1316
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:46,390
that rocks and dirt and stuff doesn't
get deep into your shoe.

1317
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,720
Um,
and I think who you is coming out with a

1318
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:52,240
boot that actually has a gator built in
was kind of interesting,

1319
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,880
but they could see the salomon trail
gaters yeah.

1320
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:58,180
See,
so the idea is to make sure that you're

1321
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:02,440
not getting irritants,
dirt and shit and debris.

1322
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,930
Did you ever wear anything like that
when you were?

1323
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,063
Definitely,
yeah,

1324
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:06,850
definitely.
Yeah.

1325
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,790
Is that a,
is that a must have some hikers?

1326
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,960
I'd say kind of roll their eyes at it.
I started off rolling my eyes at it and

1327
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:14,560
then it was just like you're saying it
was just good.

1328
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,580
I mean five times a day I would get a
little pine needle in my sock and it's

1329
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:19,690
just like,
oh damn it.

1330
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,321
Like,
yeah,

1331
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:22,490
I got to get something to keep that
going out.

1332
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:26,920
So I would imagine that you would have
an incredible ability to test gear.

1333
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:32,400
Like nobody would probably know what
gears effective and durable and really,

1334
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,120
really like over the longterm.
Yeah,

1335
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,270
totally.
And it's like,

1336
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,790
I mean,
a part of the Ata,

1337
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,700
I'd been backpacking for over 10 years
and I thought I was kind of okay,

1338
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:43,480
I'm pretty familiar with this stuff.
And I was like,

1339
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,950
no,
no,

1340
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,330
I didn't know anything about
backpacking.

1341
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:48,400
And Yeah,
you test everything,

1342
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,380
you know,
and it's like even even after all your

1343
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:51,720
research,
you start realizing like,

1344
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,590
hmm,
there's a little bit better stuff out

1345
00:57:53,591 --> 00:57:55,960
there or yeah,
I can actually tweak this and improve

1346
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:56,560
this and that.

1347
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,311
But yeah.
But at the end of it,

1348
00:57:57,311 --> 00:58:01,480
it's like anybody was through hike.
This can get into some real nerdy

1349
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,020
backpacking gear talk,
you know,

1350
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:07,930
hunters get into real nerdy backpacking
gear talk when they talk about like deep

1351
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,690
in the woods,
back country hunting because weights

1352
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,920
initiative,
huge issue.

1353
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,260
They chop the ends off of their
toothbrushes,

1354
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:16,320
you know,
that's like a big issue with you.

1355
00:58:16,321 --> 00:58:17,910
You did that to big time.
Yeah.

1356
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:18,850
Wow.
That's so crazy.

1357
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:22,090
Like the idea that the bottom of your
toothbrush every ounce,

1358
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:22,924
man,
that's fine.

1359
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,700
You won't ounces equals pounds,
right?

1360
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:26,920
Yeah.
So that was one thing that got cody and

1361
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,350
I talked to him was cody was talking
about cutting,

1362
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,860
cutting weight from backpacking.
I feel like my impression,

1363
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:36,150
at least when we were talking,
I was thinking hunters.

1364
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,030
We're almost kind of the,
the Chubby guy in the blind.

1365
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,170
It was kind of my idea.

1366
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,580
I was like,
when my dad and I would hunt,

1367
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:45,750
it was Kinda just truly sitting there
with blue jeans and it was just kinda

1368
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:46,361
like,
all right,

1369
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:47,610
there's a duck,
you know,

1370
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:51,100
it was like talking to cody,
I think hunting I was doing was pretty

1371
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:54,370
amateur and it was.
Cody was talking about cutting weight

1372
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:57,610
significantly in that.
Hunters have kind of latched onto some

1373
00:58:57,611 --> 00:58:59,680
of the backpacking,
you know,

1374
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,760
ethos,
if you will,

1375
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:04,210
about shaving every ounce.
But it's like y'all carry so much more

1376
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:06,460
gear.
Like you got weapons,

1377
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:07,350
you know,
like that's.

1378
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,740
Those things aren't made to count every
ounce I would imagine we had.

1379
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:14,620
Depends on what you caring.
But there are some lightweight rifles

1380
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:17,770
that people use so that are like carbon
five barrels and stuff.

1381
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,890
But the issue with those is they,
unless you're like prone and you're

1382
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:22,160
laying

1383
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,190
down on something,
they move a little bit more and a lot of

1384
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:28,040
people think they're not as accurate as
like a real heavy rifle.

1385
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:30,140
Like a lot of guys.
Sacrifices.

1386
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,180
Yeah.
They look a heavy rifle,

1387
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,070
like a heavy barrel,
thick,

1388
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,410
heavy barrel.
And the same thing was bose.

1389
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:40,790
That's a weird thing.
Like some people like heavy bose because

1390
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,020
it's usually you hold steadier,
you know,

1391
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,180
there's the thought behind it that you
have something light in your hand and

1392
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:49,550
you're shaking a little bit.
Like maybe you're a little nerves,

1393
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,400
he might move around a little bit more,
but if you've got something that's

1394
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:53,740
stable,
he heavy,

1395
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,000
you know,
you'll have more stability when you're

1396
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:59,750
executing the shot.
But killer equipment to.

1397
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,300
Yeah,
a lot of guys carry spotting scopes and

1398
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:07,160
15 power by nose and they have eight to
10 power by nose around their neck.

1399
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,370
And
you know.

1400
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,070
Yeah,
depends on what kind of stuff you use.

1401
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,660
You know,
some people,

1402
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,550
they'll sacrifice,
uh,

1403
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,120
like spotting scopes.
They won't do that,

1404
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,300
they won't bring it.
But some people were,

1405
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,550
some people also want to film other
stuff,

1406
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:27,590
so they bring tripods for filming and a
tripod for glassing glassing meaning you

1407
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:28,361
know,
lock,

1408
01:00:28,361 --> 01:00:29,194
uh,
uh,

1409
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:32,480
either by [inaudible] or a spotting
scope on a tripod,

1410
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,570
so you get a real steady view because it
really makes a difference.

1411
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:38,000
Like if you see more animals,
yeah,

1412
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,640
if you're holding up like the
[inaudible] in your hand,

1413
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:44,270
you got to Kinda like put your elbows on
your knees and you sit down.

1414
01:00:44,271 --> 01:00:46,700
But it's not as good like being on a
tripod,

1415
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:49,880
so the best way for sure.
But then you got carry the equipment,

1416
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,650
you've got to carry that fucking tripod
around.

1417
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,350
And there's,
I think there's a big difference between

1418
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:59,351
people that they carry their stuff in
and then they make a camp versus people

1419
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:02,210
to keep their camp on their back all the
time.

1420
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:04,700
There's a lot of that too.
There's different kinds of hunting.

1421
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:05,110
Like,
dude,

1422
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,500
do you know that ever took bag?
Wait,

1423
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:09,230
I think cody was mentioning it was like
60 or 70 pounds.

1424
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,640
Do you have any idea?
Yeah.

1425
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:13,100
A lot of guys will carry in 60,
70 pounds.

1426
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:15,590
That's pretty standard,
but again,

1427
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:18,050
they're not.
These guys are not carrying their camp

1428
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,170
on their back just.
But if they do like if they know they

1429
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:23,420
have to go in deep and they have to live
off their back.

1430
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,650
Like they have a Bibi Bibi tent and
they,

1431
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,790
they do the whole thing off their back.
Most guys would try to drop it in the

1432
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:31,500
forties,
but if you carry around 40 fucking

1433
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,353
pounds,
man,

1434
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,180
like there's a company called the
outdoorsman and Phoenix and they make

1435
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:38,780
like a real high end pack and one of the
things that they've made that they

1436
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:42,800
actually just sent me,
it's a pack frame that has like an

1437
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:44,900
Olympic plate mount on it.

1438
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:50,080
So you can put like a 45 pound plate and
another 45 pound platelet and 90 pound

1439
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:53,720
plate and you train with his fucking
pack frame on.

1440
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,630
So you put the frame on.
You mean like a little,

1441
01:01:56,631 --> 01:02:01,400
like a weight lifting,
like lifting slides onto your back the

1442
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:04,550
same way with slide onto the end of a
barbell and it,

1443
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:05,660
you know,
use a clamp,

1444
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:08,570
like a,
like a barbell clamp locks the plate in

1445
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:10,370
place,
and then you go up hills and these

1446
01:02:10,371 --> 01:02:13,100
fucking things on.
So these guys are just trending.

1447
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,410
Yeah,
they're training to get ready for these

1448
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:18,410
back country hunts.
I had the same idea as you did.

1449
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:19,770
I thought hunters like,
oh,

1450
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,630
duck dynasty guys.
They're all fat.

1451
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,550
Right?
And they just rednecks.

1452
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:25,230
They're shooting at Shit.
No,

1453
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:29,460
not western hunting is a big difference
between the southern hunter.

1454
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,200
Yeah.
Well there's a big difference between

1455
01:02:31,201 --> 01:02:34,200
blind hunting,
like people that sit in these blinds

1456
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:37,200
when blind is,
is like for people listening is like,

1457
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:42,360
it's basically like a little structure
that's covered with like Cammo and

1458
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:43,290
you're,
you're hiding,

1459
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,090
you're hiding,
waiting for the animal,

1460
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:47,820
and then you shoot them or tree stand,
same thing.

1461
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,860
You're sitting in the tree stand,
you're waiting and then you shoot them.

1462
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,770
There's a big difference between that
and these western hunters,

1463
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:55,510
particularly like elk hunters because
they're going into the mountains where

1464
01:02:55,511 --> 01:02:59,400
these animals live or mule deer,
they're going to the high country and

1465
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:02,250
you're climbing up,
you're going up thousands of feet of

1466
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:04,770
elevation every day up and down,
up and down,

1467
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:08,100
and you have to have massive endurance.
So a lot of these guys start trail

1468
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:11,130
running.
A lot of these guys start putting packs

1469
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:13,950
on their back with,
with heavyweights in the pack and

1470
01:03:13,951 --> 01:03:15,330
training,
getting ready for this.

1471
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:19,710
Otherwise you're fucking miserable.
If you're not in a real shape,

1472
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,240
you're miserable.
You know?

1473
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:23,340
Got a good foot.
You got to get a real fit.

1474
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,620
Interesting.
Yeah,

1475
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,820
that's not what it is.
Well,

1476
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:29,220
my friend Cameron names,
he does a lot of ultra marathons.

1477
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:31,110
He just,
he just did the big foot 200,

1478
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:34,380
which is 205 miles in Washington state.

1479
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,380
How long has it to 78 hours.
He ran for seven,

1480
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:38,550
eight hours.
Wow.

1481
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,000
Fuck everything about that will.
Right.

1482
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:42,630
But,
but that just shows,

1483
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:44,460
you mean he's as extreme as it gets.
You know,

1484
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:47,070
he's like one of the top bowhunters in
the world,

1485
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:50,130
but the point is these people are
athletes,

1486
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,073
the w,
the,

1487
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,820
the,
the ca in the group of them,

1488
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,610
the elite of the elite there,
so few.

1489
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,050
It's a really,
really small club of individuals that

1490
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,550
get to that point,
but the vast majority of them are in

1491
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:09,270
spectacular shape where they're
constantly running trails.

1492
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,210
There are constantly working out.
They're constantly in shape and the

1493
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:15,090
reason being is if you're not,
you're not going to be successful in the

1494
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:17,780
back country.
And one of the things that really haunt

1495
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:20,850
them is when they can't get to an animal
because they're out of shape.

1496
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:23,970
And I've been there before.
I've tried that where I was like,

1497
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:26,070
well,
when I was last year I was hunting with

1498
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,200
cam and we went up,
we're trying to get to this elk,

1499
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,300
and he ran up the hill like a fucking
mountain goat and I'm halfway behind

1500
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:32,134
them.

1501
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,840
I thought it was in pretty good shape
and I am for the stuff I do,

1502
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:39,960
but I wasn't in good shape for running
up hills.

1503
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:41,191
You know,
you gotTa,

1504
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:43,860
you gotta do that to be in shape for
running up hills.

1505
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:46,960
You've got to run up hills and a lot of
these guys there,

1506
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,930
they have these uh,
events,

1507
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:49,980
these,
uh,

1508
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,740
trained to hunt events that they do
where they compete against each other

1509
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,820
and they put backpacks on and they run
and they,

1510
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,170
they,
they try to get from point a to point b

1511
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:00,130
faster.
There's a lot of people are criticizing.

1512
01:05:00,131 --> 01:05:02,970
You think it's kind of dangerous and
it's because it's not really running

1513
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:04,980
with weapons.
What is the interest about it?

1514
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,870
Wait,
you're talking about still about the

1515
01:05:06,871 --> 01:05:10,110
barbell.
The barbell things is completely new and

1516
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:11,810
ventured by the outdoorsman.
It,

1517
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,660
it hasn't even come out yet,
but most people just pack heavyweights

1518
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,370
like sandbags and strap down at their
backpack.

1519
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,350
But uh,
it's,

1520
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:25,530
it's a different world as far as like
the perception of what these people are

1521
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:29,980
versus what they're actually doing.
And there's a real ignorance when people

1522
01:05:29,981 --> 01:05:32,890
are talking about hunting,
they think of it as like this really

1523
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:35,350
easy thing.
You just go shoot this animal.

1524
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:39,190
And they think the hunters are cruel
because that's what bad thing that

1525
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:43,090
killed Bambi and you know what I mean,
like this is weird ideas that people

1526
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:44,500
have in their head about what hunting
is.

1527
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:47,260
And I think in general that was kind of
my impression of the,

1528
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:48,730
uh,
I guess,

1529
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:50,580
I don't know if easy is the right word,
but yeah,

1530
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:51,760
not,
not physical.

1531
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:54,850
Certainly enough physical.
No one would think from the outside

1532
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:58,420
without really examining it and looking
in that you're talking about like elite

1533
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:02,050
endurance athletes.
But if you took the average person that

1534
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:04,660
thinks they're in shape,
and I have friends that have done this

1535
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:06,550
before,
taking people that think they're in

1536
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:07,960
shape and take them on these hunts.

1537
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,240
And these people break down slug.
Yeah.

1538
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:11,680
They just can't make it.
They can't do it.

1539
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:13,270
They just,
they're just not prepared for it.

1540
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,170
And it's hard to prepare.
And there's,

1541
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:19,360
they say there's very few things you can
do other than put weight on your back

1542
01:06:19,361 --> 01:06:21,670
and go up,
go up and down hills and just do it.

1543
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:25,510
Yeah.
Some people say boxes,

1544
01:06:25,511 --> 01:06:26,344
you know,
steps,

1545
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,520
you know,
those things.

1546
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:30,220
Like when people step up with one leg at
a gym,

1547
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:31,410
you know,
and they,

1548
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:34,780
and they do that over and over again.
Some people say that that's a good way

1549
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:36,730
to prepare for,
for hiking as well.

1550
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:40,840
Just box steps over and over again,
like commit to the.

1551
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:41,921
Yep.
Yeah,

1552
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:43,640
just get those quads.
I run,

1553
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,370
I'm weird.
Weirdly in some ways.

1554
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,790
Um,
trail bikes apparently very good like

1555
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:52,540
doing dirt bike because you're
constantly pumping one leg at a time and

1556
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:57,541
apparently that is very good for
mimicking the type of strength that you

1557
01:06:58,091 --> 01:06:58,960
need to get up.

1558
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,830
And down hills goes back to like what
you said about just doing it though.

1559
01:07:02,831 --> 01:07:03,850
It's was like,
yeah,

1560
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:04,850
just do it,
you know,

1561
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,010
it sucks though,
man.

1562
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:10,060
I did it the other day.
I did a five mile hike or four mile hike

1563
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:11,100
and uh,
one of the,

1564
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:16,110
the whole one of the miles I did with my
daughter who's 50 pounds and from a mile

1565
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,600
up the hill I carried her on my back.
So she worked.

1566
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,860
She got tired and so,
uh,

1567
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:26,861
I put her on my shoulders and I carried
her one mile straight up hill on my back

1568
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:29,160
and all my God,
I was drawn ranched.

1569
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:30,760
I mean my jet,
my Hoodie,

1570
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:33,160
I was wearing a hoodie.
It was soaked to the bone,

1571
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:38,080
put sweat was pouring down my head.
I was heaving as I was carrying her,

1572
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:40,450
you know,
it's really interesting how difficult it

1573
01:07:40,451 --> 01:07:42,790
is because just the hike,
it's kinda difficult,

1574
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,800
but I could do it because I'm in pretty
good shape.

1575
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:49,950
But the hike with a
50 pound kid on your shoulders fucking a

1576
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,600
thousand times harder of A.
Yeah,

1577
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:54,950
it's hard.
But I,

1578
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,460
uh,
but I used it as a workout and she's

1579
01:07:57,461 --> 01:07:59,070
like,
if you're too tired you can stop.

1580
01:07:59,090 --> 01:07:59,411
Like,
no,

1581
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:00,310
no,
it's a good workout.

1582
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:01,420
It's good.
It's good for me.

1583
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,230
You know,
it was probably freaked her out here.

1584
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:07,410
Maybe go
carrying or like thinking I'm going to

1585
01:08:07,411 --> 01:08:08,860
fall or something like that.
But it wasn't,

1586
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,020
wasn't dangerous.
Like it wasn't like I was,

1587
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:14,500
my legs were failing,
but I was breathing fucking heavy,

1588
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:16,880
that's for sure.
So you've got to imagine these guys that

1589
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:21,881
are carrying 20 pounds more than that
and they're carrying their weight deep

1590
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:23,850
into the mountains,
you know,

1591
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:26,420
or the pack out.
That's the other thing.

1592
01:08:26,421 --> 01:08:29,090
When you kill an animal,
like you've got 100 pounds on your back

1593
01:08:29,091 --> 01:08:32,510
now and you've got to slowly but surely
make your way in.

1594
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:35,540
A lot of guys get seriously injured
during this.

1595
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:36,860
Let's say,
what do you do to drag it?

1596
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:40,310
You put it in your backpack.
One hundred pound animal

1597
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,810
[inaudible] yeah,
we'll know much more than a hundred

1598
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:47,050
pound animal.
Usually any deer you shoot is going to

1599
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:50,200
be more than 100 pounds and an elk is
way more than a hundred pounds.

1600
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,070
So what you're doing is you're making
multiple trips with 100 pounds on your

1601
01:08:54,071 --> 01:08:54,970
back.
The heck it up.

1602
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,860
Yeah.
You have to chop it up.

1603
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:01,570
Now when it comes to like backpacks and
things along those lines,

1604
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:04,750
like what?
How do you choose what kind of backpack

1605
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:05,720
you need?
And like you,

1606
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:08,350
you must have like a weight
consideration as well.

1607
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:10,840
And as far as volume,
like how much stuff you need.

1608
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:13,150
You said you carry one change of
clothes,

1609
01:09:13,151 --> 01:09:15,700
so you basically have one pair of socks,
one pair of underwear,

1610
01:09:15,701 --> 01:09:17,830
one pair of pants,
other than stuff you have on,

1611
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:20,020
right,
you bring a change of shoes,

1612
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,290
um,
you typically break it up by activity so

1613
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:25,540
you have,
um,

1614
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,970
hiking and sleeping,
so you have your hiking set of clothes

1615
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:31,400
and gear and then you have your
sleeping.

1616
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:36,410
So hiking clothes are usually like a,
just like maybe like workout clothes,

1617
01:09:36,411 --> 01:09:38,420
like a synthetic,
short sleeve top,

1618
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,540
maybe even running shorts,
um,

1619
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:44,780
and you know,
a set of socks to hike in and then your

1620
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,400
trail runners to hike in.
Um,

1621
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,360
it's Kinda like you're hiking attire,
you know,

1622
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:53,820
I'm certainly not like the pant hiking
boot kind of image.

1623
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:54,910
I think that's,
that's,

1624
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:55,840
that's,
you know,

1625
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,690
going away.
And then you have your sleeping set of

1626
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:02,990
closed your camp clothes,
which is a typically like a very

1627
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:07,991
minimalist camp shoe.
It's all about weight because that's,

1628
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:10,380
that piece of footwear is on your back,
right?

1629
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,690
So you want to make sure that one's
light,

1630
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,340
you know,
so a lot of people even used crocs.

1631
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,260
I know these crocs because it's super
light,

1632
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:17,630
it's light and it's waterproof and walk
around camping.

1633
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,503
Um,
and then,

1634
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,700
um,
you know,

1635
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:21,560
some kind of wool,
like honestly this,

1636
01:10:21,561 --> 01:10:24,800
I love this book,
a Merino Merino wool,

1637
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:28,190
something warm to sleep in something dry
like that.

1638
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,410
Those clothes,
like get your hiking clothes,

1639
01:10:30,411 --> 01:10:31,850
wet,
dirty all day long,

1640
01:10:31,851 --> 01:10:34,040
but when you come home or when you get
to camp at night,

1641
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,390
it's like,
keep it,

1642
01:10:35,391 --> 01:10:37,760
make sure it's comfortable,
make sure it's drugs.

1643
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:40,940
That's your saving grace if you have to
go to sleep in wet clothes and

1644
01:10:40,941 --> 01:10:41,774
wintertime,
like,

1645
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:42,940
that's no good.

1646
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,320
Yeah.
Now why,

1647
01:10:44,321 --> 01:10:45,430
uh,
why synthetic?

1648
01:10:45,431 --> 01:10:48,970
Why do you choose synthetic?
So I know a lot of people choose Marino

1649
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:51,340
for,
for hiking as well because it regulates

1650
01:10:51,341 --> 01:10:52,061
temperature.
Well,

1651
01:10:52,061 --> 01:10:54,610
and when it's wet you could still stay
warm.

1652
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:55,720
Uh,
I think you,

1653
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,220
I mean,
you can have arguments on both sides.

1654
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,950
Uh,
I personally like synthetic just because

1655
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,550
I feel like it dries faster and it's a
little more durable like this is,

1656
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,130
this would just tear,
you know,

1657
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:07,810
and it's like,
I like getting down and dirty when I

1658
01:11:07,811 --> 01:11:11,260
hike and I'm like a synthetic shirt even
just from Walmart,

1659
01:11:11,261 --> 01:11:11,830
you know,
nothing,

1660
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:14,100
nothing amazing.
Just delights lightweight since the

1661
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,810
synthetic shirt.
Um,

1662
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:17,500
I think it was just going to breathe and
uh,

1663
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:18,780
um,
yeah,

1664
01:11:18,781 --> 01:11:22,110
dry faster,
but I mean marina marina to and what

1665
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,070
kind of package using a man I could
totally nerd out on packs.

1666
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:29,220
I did it.
I used an osprey on actual 80 a hike.

1667
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:32,220
I don't want to talk bad about Osprey
spray spray a lot,

1668
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:33,990
but I would not hike with them again and
I do,

1669
01:11:33,991 --> 01:11:37,800
um,
how come a hate to be,

1670
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:38,730
you know,
kind of,

1671
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:40,320
um,
from aesthetics,

1672
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:41,470
but I just don't like the way they look.

1673
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,640
Got This,
they've got this like,

1674
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,860
um,
that seems like the last thing that you

1675
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:48,240
consider when you're wearing crocs,
but that's true.

1676
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,870
But they have this,
um,

1677
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,950
they kind of pride themselves and
breathable back.

1678
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,750
Do you know what?
I'm know that was pretty like they have

1679
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:58,180
like that concave back and it just feels
like a,

1680
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:00,570
like a turtle shell as can't stand it.
It's like,

1681
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,490
I feel like I'm like falling back with
it.

1682
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,470
Okay.
So the weight's not tight to your back.

1683
01:12:04,471 --> 01:12:06,480
Yeah.
I want something snug on my back.

1684
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,740
Um,
I guess that's not.

1685
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:10,560
I mean it's a little utility.
Not that's a big issue for utility.

1686
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,191
Yeah.
Yeah,

1687
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:12,900
exactly.
You just think they look weird to.

1688
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:14,190
Exactly.
It's like,

1689
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:17,760
I don't like it looks bizarre.
Like what's the name of the practice?

1690
01:12:17,761 --> 01:12:20,400
We can pull it up a osprey.
Exos.

1691
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,960
Fifty eight.
Um,

1692
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:24,960
and so that's 5,800 liters.

1693
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,670
Is that what it is?
It's 58 liters.

1694
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,240
Fifty eight liters.
Liters.

1695
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:28,921
Yeah.
And then um,

1696
01:12:28,921 --> 01:12:30,060
but um,
if I were to do it again,

1697
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:34,080
there are a handful of pretty bad ass
ultra light pat companies.

1698
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:35,720
It's kind of,
you've got this bell curve of like

1699
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:39,480
Osprey is like the majority of
backpackers and it's like you get into

1700
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:42,980
like that niche ultra light and then
you've got like a handful too.

1701
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,150
There.
It is appealing.

1702
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,473
Yeah.
That's it.

1703
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:50,760
So that's a,
just looks like a space in between the

1704
01:12:50,761 --> 01:12:51,700
back.
Right?

1705
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,540
I'm not into that.
So that's just for breathability.

1706
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:55,650
Yeah.
But it's like,

1707
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:56,610
man,
you're sweaty pig.

1708
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:58,430
No matter how you look at it,
I just don't,

1709
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,380
I just don't see the argument for
breathability back there.

1710
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,480
There's some people like it.
Definitely.

1711
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,200
So it's just a,
it's maybe personal preference.

1712
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:09,150
Yeah.
So what is like,

1713
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,490
what's the elite of the elite?

1714
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,010
Uh,
I could,

1715
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:16,740
I would probably say like four.
There's a hyperlink mountain gear,

1716
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:18,383
uh,
they make.

1717
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:20,550
What's a Cuban fiber?
Do you know?

1718
01:13:20,551 --> 01:13:21,630
Cuban fiber,
the material,

1719
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,240
Cuban,
Cuban fiber.

1720
01:13:23,241 --> 01:13:25,220
It's called Dyneema now.
It's okay.

1721
01:13:25,221 --> 01:13:29,090
I've heard of Dyneema Dyneema for um,
both strings.

1722
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,530
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1723
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:32,430
Um,
so,

1724
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:33,810
uh,
but it's lightweight,

1725
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,420
strong on.
They're super expensive.

1726
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,820
Hyperlight mountain gear mix.
I like their packs.

1727
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:41,040
Gossamer gear.
They make great packs,

1728
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:45,750
a little more affordable.
Super lightweight granite gear.

1729
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:48,240
It's another one.
And then ula equipment,

1730
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:51,600
was it probably be the four pack
companies I'd,

1731
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:52,560
uh,
I'd want,

1732
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:54,410
I'd want to use for the next cycle
would,

1733
01:13:54,411 --> 01:13:56,570
if there's a,
is there a cost,

1734
01:13:56,571 --> 01:14:00,320
not an option.
Best best one or is it just all four of

1735
01:14:00,321 --> 01:14:03,440
them are really similar.
Even the guy,

1736
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,890
the gossamer gear,
Mariposa,

1737
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:07,950
that's a model.
They're probably more affordable than

1738
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:10,200
some of the other options.
I'd probably like it the most.

1739
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:13,240
So yeah.
Even even if money wouldn't,

1740
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,500
you know,
money wasn't an issue there,

1741
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:16,720
so one of the more affordable packs and
make the best.

1742
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:21,190
What's interesting about pacs is a lot
of it is like where it centers the

1743
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:25,810
weight on you and you can make one pack
with the same amount of weight would

1744
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:30,811
feel lighter than another pack just by
the way it's designed and the way the

1745
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:33,880
load lifters work and all that jazz and
your torso length,

1746
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:36,160
like you know what fit you might not fit
me.

1747
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:36,994
Right,
right.

1748
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,043
Yeah.
It's like,

1749
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:39,600
yeah,
I went backpacking with my girlfriend.

1750
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:42,460
I gave her some of my pecs and her torso
just so much shorter than mine.

1751
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:45,790
Like the hip belt wasn't working
properly so she can rest the weight on

1752
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:48,580
her hips and then it's all on her
shoulders and then she's like,

1753
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:49,630
God,
this sucks.

1754
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:52,180
And I'm like,
that's one of the best picks up there,

1755
01:14:52,181 --> 01:14:53,590
you know.
So do you have to,

1756
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:57,310
can you adjust it for her or is it just
needs a bit different path?

1757
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:59,410
I did different.
You need different says hm.

1758
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:03,220
That's interesting.
So how do you know what to choose?

1759
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:04,630
You have to just try them out.

1760
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,180
Uh,
I would.

1761
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:07,860
Yeah.
And to try them out.

1762
01:15:07,861 --> 01:15:10,380
And it's hard to do because like your
local Rei,

1763
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,470
um,
I don't know if

1764
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,160
they don't carry those kind of niche
ultralight Pepsi can't go try them on.

1765
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,260
They care,
they'll carry on,

1766
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,440
they'll carry osprey.
Yeah.

1767
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:24,180
Good.
Try him on measure torso link.

1768
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:28,200
Some of those online retailers have ways
to measure your torso length,

1769
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:29,820
makes sure it fits right.
But still at the end of the day,

1770
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:32,040
it's like a pair of shoes.
You gotta you gotta try them on.

1771
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:32,550
You know,

1772
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:37,470
it's interesting because hunters in
general do not use the same packs that

1773
01:15:37,471 --> 01:15:41,100
backpackers use.
Probably more holsters and all sorts of

1774
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:43,290
stuff you need.
Your needs are different I would

1775
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:43,950
imagine.
Right?

1776
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,720
Yeah,
for the most part.

1777
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:50,370
But a lot of it is like certain things
you strapped to the pack,

1778
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:54,060
like you strap your boat or your pack
and some of them have like rifle

1779
01:15:54,061 --> 01:15:56,520
holsters or rifle,
you know,

1780
01:15:56,521 --> 01:16:00,340
scabbards that you can kind of contain a
rifle and like a lot of them have a

1781
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,400
little packets or air areas.
We get strapped down and tripod or maybe

1782
01:16:05,401 --> 01:16:09,870
the top compartment you would keep your,
your binoculars or something along those

1783
01:16:09,871 --> 01:16:11,670
lines.
But I would think that there would be

1784
01:16:11,671 --> 01:16:16,530
like a lot of crossover and there's not.
There's exclusive sort of segment of the

1785
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:19,530
population or of the market rather.
Why is that?

1786
01:16:19,531 --> 01:16:20,620
Is it just marketing it?

1787
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:23,370
Just targeting different audience?
I don't know because I wouldn't think

1788
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:26,580
that that would be the case because it's
not the case really with boots that much

1789
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,780
as a lot of people use like Solomon's
and really standard hiking boots.

1790
01:16:30,781 --> 01:16:35,670
There are hunting boots like crispy and
Kenna track and there's a few of those

1791
01:16:35,671 --> 01:16:38,970
that are like specifically designed
[inaudible] snake.

1792
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:40,650
Like people use using for other things
too,

1793
01:16:40,651 --> 01:16:43,260
but they're like really well known in
the hunting world.

1794
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:47,040
Maybe the markets will start blending,
I wonder,

1795
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:50,640
but I'm just wondering like you would
think you would go to those guys,

1796
01:16:50,641 --> 01:16:52,100
the backpackers,
the,

1797
01:16:52,101 --> 01:16:56,070
the Appalachian trail people like they
would have already done the work.

1798
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,500
I would think that that's the people to
contact.

1799
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,940
They know what's good.
Yeah.

1800
01:16:59,941 --> 01:17:02,130
They're traveling for seven fucking
months.

1801
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:03,780
You,
you know?

1802
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,600
No.
Do you take like a nalgene bottle or

1803
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:09,070
something like that with you?
Like smart water bottles?

1804
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,310
Smart water.

1805
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,300
That's it.
Really?

1806
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,150
Yeah.
Like,

1807
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,330
I mean these water bottles are fine.
Um,

1808
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,030
but uh,
I like smart water because you talked

1809
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:18,680
about that filter then sell your
squeeze.

1810
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:21,230
We were talking about it.
It matches water bottle threads.

1811
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:25,190
But the problem like with like this
bottle specifically is it goes around

1812
01:17:25,191 --> 01:17:26,480
what,
like two and a half,

1813
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:30,830
maybe one and a half times around.
It's like smart water bottles.

1814
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,950
This piece is about that long and it's
just like much,

1815
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:37,250
much better.
It's much more secure so it's like more

1816
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:39,200
threads threads to,
to secure it.

1817
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:40,440
So.
So there's not gonna be any,

1818
01:17:40,441 --> 01:17:44,060
any leak or anything.
It's crazy to think that that all you

1819
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:48,020
have to do is squeeze the water,
like how long does it take to do like a,

1820
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:51,020
a one liter thing of water and that's
the biggest,

1821
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:54,520
that's the biggest con with that
specific type of filters.

1822
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:57,820
The fact that you have to manually do it
and it can take awhile.

1823
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:00,620
So if you had a group of,
let's say you wanted to go with your,

1824
01:18:00,621 --> 01:18:03,110
with your kids backpacking,
like I don't know if I'd recommend that

1825
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:05,450
filter because you're gonna have to
squeeze all their water through that one

1826
01:18:05,451 --> 01:18:07,100
little filter,
but if it's just you and you're trying

1827
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:09,230
to squeeze a half a liter,
a liter at a time,

1828
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:10,050
like it's fine.
You know,

1829
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:12,620
might take a minute.
I've seen those gravity filters to.

1830
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,780
Yeah,
like who you're going with your family

1831
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:16,730
or something and you have to do more
volume of water.

1832
01:18:16,731 --> 01:18:19,010
I'd probably go gravity filter.
So here it is right here.

1833
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,800
Okay.
So your squeeze water filtration system,

1834
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:23,690
there's a video of it.
Oh,

1835
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,670
okay.
And it squeezes into a bag.

1836
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,180
So you fill the water bottle up and then
you squeeze it.

1837
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:30,440
And then it fills that bag.

1838
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,980
So do you use one of those?
Um,

1839
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,690
so the manufacturer bag.
Oh,

1840
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:38,000
I see.
Do you use one of those tubes?

1841
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,620
Oh,
so what is it?

1842
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:41,930
What's going on right there?
That's the clean water coming out.

1843
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,450
I see,
I see.

1844
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:45,883
Oh,
so that's it.

1845
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,830
Huh?
So you fill the bag up and he squeezed

1846
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,780
that thing and then it comes out the
end.

1847
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:53,630
Wow.
It's pretty good stuff.

1848
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:55,940
It's amazing that that's all you have to
do.

1849
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,790
I would think there's a bunch of bears
shitting in that water.

1850
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:01,130
Like what are the odds that you could
just do that?

1851
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:02,840
Yeah,
that's crazy.

1852
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,560
I think they're marketing more towards
like,

1853
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,020
um,
know like Africa and stuff.

1854
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:06,863
No.
All right.

1855
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:09,590
If you get,
if you have a water source that's

1856
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:12,290
polluted,
like you can start to get water for

1857
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:12,910
village,
you know,

1858
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:16,330
it's like just squeeze it through in the
head like a warranty of uh,

1859
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:18,740
some,
some insane amount of water can go

1860
01:19:18,741 --> 01:19:19,740
through there,
you know?

1861
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:22,360
And then what do you do?
You have to change the filters.

1862
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,230
Just throw it away and get another one.
They're like,

1863
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:26,620
I don't know,
40 bucks.

1864
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:27,381
I was like,
good,

1865
01:19:27,381 --> 01:19:29,300
another good,
another filter every 10 years.

1866
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:33,030
That's it.
I think their warranty is like,

1867
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:36,200
I don't know what to throw out a number,
but it's like a million gallons of just

1868
01:19:36,201 --> 01:19:40,340
something ridiculous.
That little thing can go through a

1869
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:43,070
million gallons of water.
What does that filter smell like after

1870
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:44,960
the ads that you're supposed to back
flush it.

1871
01:19:44,961 --> 01:19:47,080
Like my back flows when you back flushed
mind.

1872
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:48,410
Alright,
you got the one way,

1873
01:19:48,411 --> 01:19:51,950
the dirty water goes through this way
and you just push through the crap right

1874
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,270
out the other way and yeah,
when you do that on mine,

1875
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,770
like it was just black water coming out.
Oh,

1876
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:00,420
it's interesting to think like all that
black water.

1877
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:03,020
It's just filtered out of what looks
like clean water,

1878
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:05,810
clean water in the.
Well that is interesting.

1879
01:20:05,811 --> 01:20:07,500
Well it's also like you ever,
like,

1880
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:08,130
especially

1881
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,960
in Los Angeles is a great example of
this.

1882
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:15,260
Have you ever gone to the hills and look
down on the basin of the La area and you

1883
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:18,360
see that Brown air?
Yeah.

1884
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,640
That's fucking disgusting.
But when you're there,

1885
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,170
you don't see it.
It looks normal.

1886
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,600
Walking around Hollywood,
you're like,

1887
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,080
oh look air.
I can see right through it.

1888
01:20:25,081 --> 01:20:27,890
Your lungs are doing the same thing that
filters dylan like

1889
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,740
brake dust.
That's the other thing.

1890
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:35,490
The brake dust apparently is a real
issue with New York City and places

1891
01:20:35,491 --> 01:20:38,490
where you have real congestion in tight
areas.

1892
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:42,180
You're breathing in a lot of dust from
the breaks of the cars.

1893
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,190
Had no idea.
Yeah,

1894
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,480
I didn't either.
Yeah,

1895
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:51,390
I saw some of that smoke coming into La
and a connected it in Mexico City when I

1896
01:20:51,391 --> 01:20:54,310
was coming here in Mexico City was the
same way.

1897
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:59,360
Mexico City was just like worst Mexico
cities like la is going to be in

1898
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:00,630
probably 20 or 30 years.

1899
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,100
What's it?
What's going on with the politics over

1900
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:04,140
here?
I figured Joe would be clean air and

1901
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:08,730
organic and not much we could do.
When you get the volume of people that

1902
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:11,460
are here,
the amount of humans in La apparently

1903
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,540
though the base in like especially like
the valley has always been like that.

1904
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:18,840
It's always been kinda like a dust bowl,
just by the way it's shaped even back

1905
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:21,960
before there were cars,
people always complained about the brown

1906
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:26,961
air just from literally from dust and
dirt and wind and the dry air and the

1907
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:30,780
lack of moisture.
So the the dirt kicks up easy with the

1908
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:33,090
wind,
but then you add that with pollution as

1909
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:35,920
well growth.
But we have $20,

1910
01:21:35,921 --> 01:21:38,700
million plus people in this tiny little
area.

1911
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:39,540
Yeah.
You know,

1912
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:44,540
I mean literally we have as many people
as the entire country of Australia in

1913
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:46,740
the La area.

1914
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:49,200
That's crazy.
Fucking really crazy.

1915
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:52,800
There's just too many.
And now now that trump has lightened

1916
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:57,030
that EPA protection standards and
they're,

1917
01:21:57,031 --> 01:21:59,820
they're changing the standards of
automobiles.

1918
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:04,770
What automobiles need to achieve.
So supposedly to help business,

1919
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:06,300
but fuck man.
What cost?

1920
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:08,040
Yeah.
I think that seems like a short term

1921
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:10,320
solution to a longterm problems.
Terrible idea.

1922
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:13,260
Terrible idea.
I mean there's a reason why people,

1923
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:18,030
why they set those standards and they're
trying to achieve cleaner and cleaner

1924
01:22:18,031 --> 01:22:19,530
standard.
So like if you go back,

1925
01:22:19,531 --> 01:22:21,960
apparently the 19 seventies in Los
Angeles,

1926
01:22:21,961 --> 01:22:24,990
the traffic was,
it was pollution was way worse because

1927
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:29,280
when you're around those cars you ever
been around like old old cars like you

1928
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,020
know,
1970 car.

1929
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,030
Not particularly.
Now when you're around them,

1930
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:38,031
apparently just an old car like that,
just sitting around a Po produces

1931
01:22:39,061 --> 01:22:42,120
pollution,
not even driving because the gas tank is

1932
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:46,260
not airtight and fucking fumes leak out
into the environment,

1933
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:48,030
just the oil.

1934
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:50,370
Those things are always leaking oil and
shit.

1935
01:22:50,371 --> 01:22:52,620
When they drive,
they just traps.

1936
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,830
That is disgusting.
There's just fire.

1937
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:59,880
I mean they're basically just burning
gasoline is coming out the back and so

1938
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:01,730
why are they different?
None of that regulations.

1939
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:04,710
That's Manhattan from 1966.
It's crazy.

1940
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,550
Yeah.
Well that's those old cars,

1941
01:23:06,551 --> 01:23:09,790
man.
Old Cars were fucking terrible and

1942
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:14,791
regulations fixed a lot of that stuff.
And the upper right hand corner is as

1943
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:20,040
Los Angeles,
I got that fucking smog in La and it's

1944
01:23:20,711 --> 01:23:22,900
going to get worse now.
Mean he was getting better,

1945
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:25,060
but it's going to get worse.
I mean,

1946
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:30,360
if he really does succeed in lowering
the standards,

1947
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,380
the emission standards.
So you're China.

1948
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,650
China is awful.
It's just about to say visioning of you

1949
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,430
who've been to China.
I've watched a documentary literally.

1950
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,290
I literally like when I was in.
This was years ago,

1951
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:43,480
but when I was in China I was just like
sick,

1952
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:45,910
literally sick.
Like I was talking with a gravel voice.

1953
01:23:45,911 --> 01:23:47,940
It's just like people live there,
you know,

1954
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:50,480
like every day.
Yeah,

1955
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:53,770
no things.
Well that is got to be one thing that's

1956
01:23:53,771 --> 01:23:56,980
positive about doing the Appalachian
trail is that you're constantly in

1957
01:23:56,981 --> 01:24:01,000
nature and you're constantly around all
those trees and the walking through the

1958
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:03,670
mountains and the healthy stuff.
Yeah.

1959
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:07,000
You're drinking like A.
I'm not going to say that'll stream

1960
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:08,200
waters clean,
but I mean,

1961
01:24:08,201 --> 01:24:09,040
yeah,
you're drinking

1962
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,610
river water,
you're surrounded by trees all the time.

1963
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:13,950
You're not near city lights,
like air pollution.

1964
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,340
It's pretty.
And you're exercising every day,

1965
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:17,971
all day,
you know,

1966
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:19,200
it's pretty healthy way of life

1967
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,070
in a way.
And it lets you start talking about

1968
01:24:22,071 --> 01:24:26,300
stress fractures.
So when you quit your job,

1969
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:28,850
you,
you didn't just do the Appalachian trail

1970
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,160
like you,
you kind of became a world traveler,

1971
01:24:31,161 --> 01:24:31,994
right?

1972
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:33,830
Yeah.
And I still kind of am honestly.

1973
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:34,683
Yeah.
Um,

1974
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,610
yeah.
Like I'm in Guatemala right now.

1975
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:40,280
And um,
what are you doing in Guatemala?

1976
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:44,120
A working online,
you know,

1977
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:47,410
I do a lot of green belly online.
So you live in Guatemala,

1978
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,790
kind of a loose term,
you know,

1979
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:50,570
living,
there's like,

1980
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:52,220
have you ever heard the term digital
nomad?

1981
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,820
Is that what you are?
I don't know if I identify myself as

1982
01:24:55,821 --> 01:24:57,140
that,
but that kind of movement of,

1983
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:02,570
of working online and working remotely
so I can truly operate most of the

1984
01:25:02,571 --> 01:25:04,550
business on online.
Um,

1985
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:08,060
so from that point of view,
it's like nowhere is off limits,

1986
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:10,430
you know,
it's as long as there's decent Internet

1987
01:25:10,431 --> 01:25:11,980
connection.
So,

1988
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:15,320
I mean my girlfriend are in Guatemala
for three months right now and then

1989
01:25:15,321 --> 01:25:17,120
we'll be in Europe and then Asia.

1990
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:20,860
I can keep an apartment anywhere.
Anything AIRBNB.

1991
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:23,020
Wow.
No possessions.

1992
01:25:23,021 --> 01:25:24,370
Truly.
Wow.

1993
01:25:24,371 --> 01:25:28,330
You're a renegade.
He out there fucking stomach.

1994
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:29,500
Your nose.
It's society.

1995
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:31,710
It's,

1996
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,030
it's growing movement,
man.

1997
01:25:33,031 --> 01:25:36,040
Like there are a lot of people like
you'll go to these cities like ching

1998
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:37,800
miles,
where it changed my Thailand was where I

1999
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:41,760
was pretty much all of last year.
Our thousands of,

2000
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:46,410
of like young international people like
running businesses off their laptop,

2001
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:49,020
you know,
and I mean there are hubs all over the

2002
01:25:49,021 --> 01:25:49,520
world,
like,

2003
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,620
like cheering Mai where they'll have
these like coworking cafes.

2004
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:58,740
It's booming right now.
Like people are all over the world,

2005
01:25:58,741 --> 01:25:59,990
like you know,
twenties,

2006
01:25:59,991 --> 01:26:04,991
30 year olds just starting off a
business just makes a thousand dollars a

2007
01:26:05,031 --> 01:26:06,380
month income,
you know,

2008
01:26:06,381 --> 01:26:08,990
and then they'll slowly grow into $2,000
a month and you know,

2009
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:11,960
next thing he knows they're replacing
their old salary at their old gig.

2010
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:15,120
Yeah,
I know people who've done that in

2011
01:26:15,121 --> 01:26:17,210
Hawaii.
I've heard of people doing that in

2012
01:26:17,211 --> 01:26:20,210
Hawaii where they moved to Hawaii and
try to operate out of there.

2013
01:26:20,211 --> 01:26:23,060
And you know,
you're essentially still in the United

2014
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,710
States,
but you're living in a beach life.

2015
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:25,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

2016
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,013
I mean,
look,

2017
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:31,460
if you can do it,
it's probably better than being trapped

2018
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:32,290
somewhere.

2019
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,220
Yeah,
no doubt.

2020
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,113
Yeah.
And it's like,

2021
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,760
no car,
no car payments,

2022
01:26:36,761 --> 01:26:39,250
no mortgage.
Like I dunno,

2023
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:39,850
I mean,
I,

2024
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:40,960
I,
I like it,

2025
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:41,711
I do,
you know,

2026
01:26:41,711 --> 01:26:44,980
I don't know about in a few years about
having kids if that's the way to go.

2027
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,030
Yeah.
Um,

2028
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:48,880
because I think like some,
some sense of stability in an

2029
01:26:48,881 --> 01:26:51,700
environment would be good.
But for now it's fantastic.

2030
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:55,390
It's definitely good for the kids.
Whether it be you're an adult,

2031
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,710
you know,
it's a different animal,

2032
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,491
you know?
I mean,

2033
01:26:57,491 --> 01:27:01,330
I think also you get the,
a lot of the people that do that kind of

2034
01:27:01,331 --> 01:27:04,240
stuff,
he get really attached to this idea of

2035
01:27:04,241 --> 01:27:06,730
being free.
You could just pull up stakes,

2036
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:09,220
throw your shit in a backpack and you're
gone.

2037
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:10,750
Like,
how many bags do you have?

2038
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,770
One.
I literally fit everything into one bag.

2039
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,540
I have two pairs of shoes.

2040
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,890
Wow.
It was like this,

2041
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:23,260
this extreme minimalist living,
you know.

2042
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:26,760
But I know a guy who does that and he's
in his sixties.

2043
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,200
Steve,
my friend Steve Maxwell,

2044
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:31,260
personal trainer,
was he living name is Trina who live in

2045
01:27:31,261 --> 01:27:32,460
California,
lives everywhere.

2046
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:35,280
He doesn't have a place.
He's lived in hotels.

2047
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,200
Yeah.
He hasn't had a place since I met him.

2048
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,800
When I met him,
he had a,

2049
01:27:38,801 --> 01:27:40,890
uh,
a van that he lived out of,

2050
01:27:40,891 --> 01:27:43,680
like a big camper van and he slept in
that thing.

2051
01:27:43,681 --> 01:27:45,090
Then he sold that fucking thing.
He's like,

2052
01:27:45,091 --> 01:27:47,910
I don't need this,
and he's just has a bag.

2053
01:27:47,911 --> 01:27:51,450
He has a bag that's about that big and
he gets everything down to that bag.

2054
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:54,900
He travels all over the world.
Less is more.

2055
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:55,621
Yeah.
I mean,

2056
01:27:55,621 --> 01:28:00,180
and he's a guy that's done the opposite.
He had a gym and he had a house and the

2057
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:03,300
family and the whole deal and his kids
grew up.

2058
01:28:03,301 --> 01:28:04,380
He got divorced.
He's like,

2059
01:28:04,381 --> 01:28:08,460
fuck this life.
And just became this kind of nomad type

2060
01:28:08,461 --> 01:28:09,510
person.
You know?

2061
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:14,650
It's a fascinating idea that mean people
are so attached to the idea of

2062
01:28:14,911 --> 01:28:17,640
permanence when it's not real.
I mean,

2063
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,920
no matter what happens,
you will die.

2064
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:24,030
And all this stuff that you've nestled a
cohort.

2065
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:25,890
Yeah.
Feathered your nest with.

2066
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,500
It's not real.
It's like you're not going to keep it

2067
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:30,960
white.
Amala.

2068
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,550
Huh?
Come on down man.

2069
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:36,090
How'd you choose that?
Costs like five bucks a year.

2070
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:38,000
That's a,
that's a plus.

2071
01:28:38,001 --> 01:28:38,661
Um,
yeah,

2072
01:28:38,661 --> 01:28:39,710
it's,
it's close to home.

2073
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,600
Um,
it doesn't have the best of health right

2074
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:43,520
now.
So I do like the idea of being somewhat

2075
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:46,460
a somewhat close to Georgia stuff needed
to come home.

2076
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:49,900
How far is the flight from Guatemala and
the Georgia [inaudible]?

2077
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:52,860
Four and a half hours.
So you can get.

2078
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:55,920
They're almost the same as like living
on the east coast and flying to the

2079
01:28:55,921 --> 01:28:56,410
west.

2080
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:57,920
Yeah.
And the same time zone.

2081
01:28:57,921 --> 01:29:00,080
It's,
it's cheap and it's like all of these

2082
01:29:00,081 --> 01:29:05,081
volcanoes around you hike all day long
and it's like the coolest thing about

2083
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,580
that.
I'm an antiwar right now in tig was like

2084
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,500
a,
I've,

2085
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,660
there are several South American cities
like this or Central American cities and

2086
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:17,661
they have the close to the equator.
So you have hot temperature all year

2087
01:29:18,601 --> 01:29:19,660
long,
kind of like a Megas,

2088
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,150
California.
You're spoiled with it,

2089
01:29:21,151 --> 01:29:21,984
right?
Yeah.

2090
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:25,320
Um,
Antigua specifically is that several

2091
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,960
thousand feet of elevation.
So you have that consistent,

2092
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:30,060
whether you're long,
however you are.

2093
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:32,760
It's not 100 degrees every day.
So it's like,

2094
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,480
um,
it's,

2095
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,940
it's very similar to here.
It's like 75 degrees every day.

2096
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:38,520
It's like 60 at night.
He speaks Spanish

2097
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:43,140
when Poquito really I would think you
would learn these.

2098
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:45,600
Speaks Spanish now.
But I know fornia

2099
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:49,230
Spanish.
My Spanish is horrible.

2100
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:50,910
I believe in dead like two months,
you know,

2101
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:52,050
like I'm not,
I haven't,

2102
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,770
I haven't picked it up.
Then I just got back from Cabo and I

2103
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:57,990
felt bad that I didn't speak Spanish.
I was down there.

2104
01:29:58,140 --> 01:29:58,980
I tried,
you know,

2105
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:03,990
I did the whole garage down there just a
week but a weekend.

2106
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,160
Yeah.
But I would like,

2107
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:08,790
I would think like if you stayed there
for any length of time,

2108
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,560
like I have a friend who has a house
there,

2109
01:30:10,561 --> 01:30:12,690
it keeps house there and they go there
every month.

2110
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:16,200
Motherfucker can't speak Spanish.
That's crazy.

2111
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:18,050
Like you should learn their language.
No,

2112
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:20,610
it's kind of like a guilty,
like an American privilege.

2113
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:21,444
I got,
I'm not going to wait.

2114
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:23,700
I was in Thailand for a year last year.
I don't know,

2115
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,710
10 words in Thai.
Wow.

2116
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:27,420
That's a shame on me.
But it's like,

2117
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:30,300
it's a commitment to learn something
that fundamentally different,

2118
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:30,690
you know?

2119
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:32,290
Yeah.
Thai especially,

2120
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:35,370
it's like no offense to learn a whole
new alphabet.

2121
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,380
Totally.
You can't even read it.

2122
01:30:37,381 --> 01:30:39,480
Right.
It's like you gotta start way back to

2123
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:41,100
kindergarten until,
you know,

2124
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,860
at least Spanish.
You can kind of read letters.

2125
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:45,690
Yeah.
So yeah,

2126
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:48,390
ties like that crazy language.
You look at it.

2127
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:49,660
It's like,
it's almost like,

2128
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:53,070
like music,
like musical notes or something.

2129
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,720
Yeah.
And it's like,

2130
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,770
other than being in Thailand,
there's no advantage of knowing Thai.

2131
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:01,410
No.
I don't mean to bash on Thailand,

2132
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:03,350
but it's like a Spanish as much more
than incentives.

2133
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:03,751
Like,
okay.

2134
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:06,900
A lot of people speak Spanish.
That would be a great thing to know.

2135
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,010
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2136
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:11,880
Spanish is probably next to English.
Maybe the most popular.

2137
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,130
What is language?
Say Mandarin.

2138
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:17,520
Maybe that's like a billion people,
but I don't know.

2139
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:20,550
The numbers in Spanish was huge.
That seems like a grind.

2140
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,840
Learning Mandarin.
Oh,

2141
01:31:21,841 --> 01:31:24,330
Jesus Christ.
Then you have to learn symbols.

2142
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:24,991
I,
they're not even.

2143
01:31:24,991 --> 01:31:26,450
It's not even letters.
Yeah.

2144
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:29,670
Fuck right there.
Grammar structure,

2145
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:30,410
everything.
Yeah.

2146
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:33,600
How do they text?
How to Chinese people text.

2147
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:35,820
Oh my God.
How do they text?

2148
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,920
How is it possible?
A

2149
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,430
really.
That's a really good point.

2150
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:42,930
Why should,
why should know this?

2151
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:46,470
I should've already asked this question.
How do they have I asked this question?

2152
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:47,730
Well,
I know in Thai you can switch your

2153
01:31:47,731 --> 01:31:50,220
keyboard and Thailand.
They switched their keyboard to.

2154
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:51,530
I don't know.
I don't,

2155
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:55,920
but they don't have the same numbers of
queues so I don't even.

2156
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:59,650
Yeah.
But with Chinese characters and how the

2157
01:31:59,651 --> 01:32:00,484
fuck

2158
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,580
would you send a text like,
you know,

2159
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:06,520
like if you sent a late night booty call
was just like emojis,

2160
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:10,720
you know,
Smiley face here now.

2161
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:11,980
Yeah.
Smiley face.

2162
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:14,680
Hard Dick,
exclamation point.

2163
01:32:14,681 --> 01:32:19,000
Thumbs up.
What is this?

2164
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,530
Oh my God.
There they go.

2165
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:22,850
They have,
they have a text,

2166
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:27,280
but how many characters?
They just simplify.

2167
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:29,381
Okay.
What is it?

2168
01:32:29,381 --> 01:32:34,270
Keyboard look like?
What does the Chinese character keyboard

2169
01:32:34,271 --> 01:32:38,590
on a cell phone look like?
Hm.

2170
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:41,530
Yeah.
But that's a keyboard on a laptop.

2171
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:44,710
What about cell phone?
Limited amount of keys.

2172
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:47,710
How weird.
Oh Wow.

2173
01:32:47,711 --> 01:32:51,910
They have options.
Uh Oh wow.

2174
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,890
Was Korean.
Huh?

2175
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,510
So to piece them together.
And make,

2176
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,650
I'm asking way too many questions.
We're not going to get the answers to

2177
01:33:02,651 --> 01:33:06,130
these either
at of all the places that you have

2178
01:33:06,131 --> 01:33:06,990
visited.
Um,

2179
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:08,770
why did you choose Guatemala?

2180
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:12,010
Uh,
close the United States.

2181
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,530
I'm hiking.
Oh,

2182
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,570
like in a place called Lake,
a teat lawn

2183
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:18,343
man.

2184
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:21,440
Go to lake.
A state law in that place is gorgeous.

2185
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,910
It's like this massive thousand depot
thousand foot deep lake surrounded by

2186
01:33:25,911 --> 01:33:28,160
volcanoes.
Just like tiny little villages around

2187
01:33:28,161 --> 01:33:29,930
there.
They were just a little bit of googling

2188
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:30,800
and it was kind of like,
hey,

2189
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,470
why not let's go to Guatemala.
So did you go

2190
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:37,630
as a visit and then decide to stay?
Or did you just go say let's see if we

2191
01:33:37,631 --> 01:33:38,710
can live here for a few months?

2192
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:39,943
Yeah,
pretty much.

2193
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:42,230
Uh,
I liked the idea of like going three

2194
01:33:42,231 --> 01:33:44,930
months at a time.
It's enough to kind of like find a gym,

2195
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,090
find your restaurant's settle into
apartment,

2196
01:33:47,091 --> 01:33:49,880
like doing every few weeks.
It's just way too many logistics,

2197
01:33:49,881 --> 01:33:50,750
you know?
Um,

2198
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:51,890
so I think we,
yeah,

2199
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:53,540
we committed,
it was like three months down there.

2200
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:56,750
I think we're going to commit to eastern
Europe for three months and then,

2201
01:33:56,751 --> 01:33:58,010
uh,
yeah,

2202
01:33:58,011 --> 01:34:00,530
coming back to Asia for three months
after the

2203
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:04,260
whole expat lifestyle,
it takes a very different kind of

2204
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:05,940
person,
you know,

2205
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:08,430
to just say,
let's try living in another country.

2206
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,250
Like when you say fit,
find a gym,

2207
01:34:11,251 --> 01:34:13,920
like what kind of gyms they have in the
little village in Guatemala.

2208
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,160
They did literally

2209
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:21,650
you mentioned that they had um,
paint buckets with cement and I'm for

2210
01:34:21,651 --> 01:34:24,830
real with pvcs and like I wouldn't work
out there.

2211
01:34:24,831 --> 01:34:27,470
That was like a teat line,
but Antigua's it really did.

2212
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,810
It's like super ghetto stuff.
So they had paint buckets filled with

2213
01:34:31,811 --> 01:34:33,880
cement that are attached to sticks.
Yeah.

2214
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:35,830
Literally that's how you worked out.
Yeah.

2215
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:37,480
Whoa.
Yeah.

2216
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,150
Wow.

2217
01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:40,710
Um,
but in tig was different.

2218
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,570
That's like a more,
it's a bigger town city,

2219
01:34:42,571 --> 01:34:45,840
like they have a proper gym.
We go to yoga classes all the whole,

2220
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:46,890
the whole nine yards.
Oh.

2221
01:34:46,891 --> 01:34:48,600
So it's almost like America.
It's totally.

2222
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:52,530
So when you're using these paint buckets
with me,

2223
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:55,730
didn't use him.
That was only at Laika teat line.

2224
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:58,480
So I'm an Antiguan Elica teat.
I was only there for a month and lake

2225
01:34:58,481 --> 01:35:02,240
teat Atlanta is like a,
maybe like seven small villages

2226
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:05,510
scattered around the lake and um,
they're actually indigenous.

2227
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,760
It's like they're directly Mayan.
Oh Wow.

2228
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:12,020
Those people.
Guatemala interesting is of all the

2229
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:14,390
South American Central American
countries as the highest percentage of

2230
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:17,720
indigenous people.
So it's like 30 percent indigenous so

2231
01:35:17,721 --> 01:35:19,880
they don't even speak Spanish.
Whoa.

2232
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:21,040
It's crazy.
And they like,

2233
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:23,920
what do they speak?
It's catch a cold kitchen.

2234
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,120
So is it a Mayan dialect?
I believe so.

2235
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:32,710
They're totally different people and
they dress traditional everything

2236
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:34,380
thing.
It's intense.

2237
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,140
Well they have a very strong will.
At least mine's did.

2238
01:35:37,141 --> 01:35:39,660
They had a very strange language where
you,

2239
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:41,880
it's,
it's like,

2240
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:45,630
there you go.
The letters or the images represent

2241
01:35:45,631 --> 01:35:49,530
sounds.
And so the sounds like,

2242
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:52,620
like you,
like you would have like an eye.

2243
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:55,200
Like this is how a Terence Mckenna
described it.

2244
01:35:55,201 --> 01:36:00,201
You'd have like an eyeball a saw an aunt
like a bug and then arose.

2245
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:03,660
And that would be the way you say,
I saw aunt rose.

2246
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:06,360
How do you know this was just from
Terence Mckenna?

2247
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,390
Him talking about it because he's,
he,

2248
01:36:08,391 --> 01:36:08,941
he,
he was,

2249
01:36:08,941 --> 01:36:11,920
uh,
he was a crazy psychedelic.

2250
01:36:11,921 --> 01:36:14,230
Did venture character,
do you know Mckenna is?

2251
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:16,170
Maybe I should,
yeah.

2252
01:36:16,171 --> 01:36:21,171
He's a fascinating speaker,
like a who was a psychedelic lecture.

2253
01:36:21,271 --> 01:36:25,680
He was a botanist and just did way too
many drugs and,

2254
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:27,720
or the right amount depending on who you
ask.

2255
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:31,020
And uh,
he got really deep into the mind culture

2256
01:36:31,021 --> 01:36:33,210
and he was one of those guys that was
thinking that December 20,

2257
01:36:33,211 --> 01:36:35,760
first 2012 is going to be some crazy
event,

2258
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:40,950
was not necessarily more of a shifting
of consciousness because it was a,

2259
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:43,260
the end of the long count of the Mayan
calendar.

2260
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:45,661
Yeah.
So,

2261
01:36:45,661 --> 01:36:47,640
well the Mayan calendar is a really
tricky thing,

2262
01:36:47,641 --> 01:36:52,170
man.
Like the sort of various different

2263
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:57,450
decipher rings of it and the people that
are attached to all these different

2264
01:36:57,690 --> 01:37:00,920
meanings to it that don't necessarily
jive with the original meetings.

2265
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:03,540
It was very hard to tell what the Mayans
men,

2266
01:37:03,541 --> 01:37:05,910
because they're not around anymore,
you know.

2267
01:37:05,911 --> 01:37:09,240
So it's not like you're,
you're studying ancient Russia where

2268
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:10,980
people are rushing scholars and they
can.

2269
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,080
There's a direct lineage between them
and the people.

2270
01:37:13,081 --> 01:37:15,450
Now you know,
when you said culture,

2271
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:18,020
the language has gone and how we're
gonna fix.

2272
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:19,020
Yeah,
they was.

2273
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:24,020
There's like some,
some translations it took forever to

2274
01:37:24,451 --> 01:37:28,770
figure out and there's things that are
similar in some ways to a Rosetta stone

2275
01:37:28,771 --> 01:37:31,530
where they're trying to match up what it
used to be,

2276
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:36,650
what it is,
what we try to figure out how you would

2277
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:41,930
say these words in the context of the
culture that existed 2000 years ago as

2278
01:37:42,961 --> 01:37:44,370
opposed to today.
Like how would you,

2279
01:37:44,371 --> 01:37:47,340
Eva,
you're talking about the way they viewed

2280
01:37:47,341 --> 01:37:49,470
things,
the way they communicated was incredibly

2281
01:37:49,471 --> 01:37:51,120
different.
That's has an interesting.

2282
01:37:51,121 --> 01:37:52,950
Yeah,
it's fascinating stuff.

2283
01:37:52,951 --> 01:37:55,920
There was a,
there was a great documentary decoding

2284
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:57,760
the Maya.
That was A.

2285
01:37:57,810 --> 01:37:59,780
I think it was a nat geo.
It sounds like that guy.

2286
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:00,910
Fuck I'm going to send you that.
Yeah,

2287
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:04,950
I think it was.
And it just detailed how difficult it

2288
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:08,610
was for these people to try to figure
out who these symbols and say,

2289
01:38:08,611 --> 01:38:09,840
all right,
what do these mean?

2290
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:13,050
What the fuck do they mean?
And apparently there was a really recent

2291
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:16,530
breakthrough where they found a bunch
of,

2292
01:38:17,170 --> 01:38:19,260
I don't think they called them
hieroglyphs,

2293
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:21,060
I don't know what they actually call
them,

2294
01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:23,140
uh,
but they,

2295
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:28,150
they found a bunch of previously
undiscovered Mayan language that sort of

2296
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:33,780
filled in some pieces that they hadn't,
hadn't filled in before.

2297
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:38,160
Then you look at some of the amazing
murals that looked like a guy seated in

2298
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:42,360
a spaceship with fire below his seat and
you try to figure out what the fuck this

2299
01:38:42,361 --> 01:38:46,140
man.
Like a lot of those ancient alien alien

2300
01:38:46,141 --> 01:38:46,920
theorists,
right?

2301
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,731
Oh,
you ever seen that one?

2302
01:38:47,731 --> 01:38:51,750
There's one is a really crazy as it
looks like a guy who's leaning back in

2303
01:38:51,751 --> 01:38:53,970
like a,
like a spaceship.

2304
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:57,840
It looks like he's leaning back in the
cockpit chair and he's looking through

2305
01:38:57,841 --> 01:39:01,380
something that looks like a telescope
and he's moving some,

2306
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:05,220
uh,
some levers with his hands and it looks

2307
01:39:05,221 --> 01:39:09,000
like there's fire beneath him.
It really bizarre,

2308
01:39:09,001 --> 01:39:12,830
fascinating stuff.
So that was drawn a long time ago.

2309
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,010
Yeah,
there it is right there.

2310
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,150
That's the.
That's the.

2311
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:21,810
That's the.
I guess there's a go full screen with

2312
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:23,160
that one right there that you got right
there.

2313
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:24,481
Yeah.
See,

2314
01:39:24,481 --> 01:39:29,481
so below him as fire.
He sitted he's moving some stuff with

2315
01:39:29,521 --> 01:39:32,640
his feet.
He's moving some levers and you see how

2316
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:36,060
he's looking through that thing and it
looks like it's got like a gas mask on

2317
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:41,300
like an oxygen mask and all those people
that like the von Danek and guys like

2318
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:47,240
they believed that what this showed was
a man sitting in a cockpit using the

2319
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,970
levers and machines to operate some sort
of a spaceship.

2320
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:57,720
So wherever that spaceship from most
likely it didn't exist.

2321
01:39:57,721 --> 01:40:01,120
Most likely these guy was for highest
fuck on the mushrooms and they're

2322
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:04,440
probably imagining the future.
I mean if I had to guess,

2323
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:09,470
I would say that these ideas were
probably very psychedelically based

2324
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:12,240
because they were really into
psychedelic drugs.

2325
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:15,390
They had found a lot of different drugs
and a lot of different vines that

2326
01:40:15,391 --> 01:40:18,030
contained lysergic acid and it's one of
the.

2327
01:40:18,031 --> 01:40:21,750
I had a did a trip to Chichen Itza,
which is really cool,

2328
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:26,280
bunch of years back and I had a
professor that was the guide.

2329
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:29,730
It was really cool because you could
hire people for a guy.

2330
01:40:29,731 --> 01:40:34,731
Then we got this guy who was a professor
in mine history and he when he knew that

2331
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:38,220
I was really into it and I asked all
these questions,

2332
01:40:38,221 --> 01:40:41,560
he was super psyched,
so he went way deep into it and we had

2333
01:40:41,561 --> 01:40:44,550
it for like six hours.
He took us on this grand tour,

2334
01:40:44,551 --> 01:40:49,551
but one of the things he showed us this
area of one of the pyramids were they

2335
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:53,010
used to do these psychedelic rituals and
he was talking about these.

2336
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:57,010
They used to take these,
these vines that had some sort of

2337
01:40:57,011 --> 01:41:01,960
lysergic acid in it and they would have
these psychedelic rituals and one of

2338
01:41:01,961 --> 01:41:04,090
the,
one of the things they used to do when

2339
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:06,430
they were studying the stars and you
know,

2340
01:41:06,431 --> 01:41:07,870
looking at it,
obviously no,

2341
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,340
no light pollution back then.

2342
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,320
Right?
So these guys are tripping their balls

2343
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:15,370
out on acid staring at this beautiful
star scape.

2344
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:19,870
And what's the DNA of the violence still
around home and I remember because it

2345
01:41:19,871 --> 01:41:22,300
was so long ago that I went,
I went and like

2346
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,650
early two thousands,
2002 or something like that.

2347
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:29,200
I think we went,
but it was amazing.

2348
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:34,620
They just think that you're standing on
the ground where these people existed

2349
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:39,160
and they had this bizarre culture that
we don't understand that was aligned to

2350
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:42,880
the cosmos.
Like the other structures were based on

2351
01:41:42,881 --> 01:41:44,420
constellations,
like the,

2352
01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:49,510
the maps of these structures mirrored
constellations and they were really into

2353
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:53,320
a astronomy and some sort of a weird
way.

2354
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:55,360
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

2355
01:41:55,361 --> 01:41:57,280
right over your head.
Like how the fuck did they,

2356
01:41:57,610 --> 01:41:59,110
they,
they apparently there's evidence that

2357
01:41:59,111 --> 01:42:04,111
they knew about the procession of the
equinoxes which is a 20 something

2358
01:42:04,331 --> 01:42:07,930
thousand year cycle of wobble of the
earth.

2359
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,990
Yeah.
Because they see that the earth isn't

2360
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:11,980
just spin,
you know,

2361
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:15,340
it doesn't just spin perfectly.
It spins with like a little bit of a

2362
01:42:15,341 --> 01:42:18,910
wobble.
So the night sky changes and it goes

2363
01:42:18,911 --> 01:42:22,180
into this 26,
I think it's 26,000 year cycle.

2364
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,330
And they apparently knew about that.
What,

2365
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:26,750
how,
how?

2366
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:28,960
No,
yeah,

2367
01:42:28,961 --> 01:42:33,730
I guess if you have a lot of time back
then and there's no iphone constantly

2368
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:37,420
distract you with checking your twitter
picture on Instagram,

2369
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:39,280
you know,
you're instead you just looking at

2370
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:41,110
constellations.
I just don't know how they would,

2371
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:43,840
how they would market,
how they,

2372
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:44,790
how will they would.
I mean,

2373
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:49,210
I guess that they would see that there's
some sort of subtle changing of the

2374
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:54,240
night sky in terms of like how it would
move a little bit all the time.

2375
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:59,320
Not just move.
Obviously the night sky moves with the

2376
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:01,830
seasons,
you're looking at a different image as

2377
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:07,170
the sun moves and this planet spins,
but it's just the,

2378
01:43:08,111 --> 01:43:10,780
the idea that these people had figured
out all these different things.

2379
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:14,800
Like in terms of like mapping
constellations so long ago.

2380
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:16,600
Wild.
Yeah.

2381
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:18,100
Amazing.
I just,

2382
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:21,880
it's,
it's fucked up that we don't know what

2383
01:43:21,881 --> 01:43:23,620
they were saying.
You know,

2384
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,820
like we've never heard their language.
Like it's one of the things about one of

2385
01:43:27,821 --> 01:43:28,231
these,
uh,

2386
01:43:28,231 --> 01:43:32,860
other documentaries that I watched was
that they were trying to mimic what the

2387
01:43:32,861 --> 01:43:36,280
sound of these Mayan languages could
have been like.

2388
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:38,770
And they really,
it was kind of guesswork,

2389
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:42,520
but they didn't know,
they can see if there's something that

2390
01:43:42,521 --> 01:43:45,070
you find or something where they,
um,

2391
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:49,840
hear what the Mayan language could have
sounded like.

2392
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:54,310
There was some sort of a really bizarre
like clicks or something I them,

2393
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:57,200
which is weird language,
but they don't even know if that's right

2394
01:43:57,410 --> 01:44:00,050
because there's no one around total
guests.

2395
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:03,980
They just died.
They just went away,

2396
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:04,610
you know,
it's,

2397
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:07,100
it's weird.
And then the language got absorbed and

2398
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:09,920
obviously these people that you were
talking about probably have some sort of

2399
01:44:09,921 --> 01:44:10,820
a dialect and.

2400
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,950
Yeah.
And I have no idea what the correlation

2401
01:44:12,951 --> 01:44:16,340
was between the current descendants in
what you're talking about.

2402
01:44:16,341 --> 01:44:17,810
Yeah.
I don't know.

2403
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,600
I mean,
what's really bizarre is it's not that

2404
01:44:20,601 --> 01:44:24,740
long ago in terms of human history
because if you look back and like human

2405
01:44:24,741 --> 01:44:28,160
history in Europe,
like there's places in Europe you can

2406
01:44:28,161 --> 01:44:30,700
visit that are 2000 years old.
I mean,

2407
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:36,580
isn't there a fucking bar somewhere in
Europe that's like almost 900 years old

2408
01:44:36,651 --> 01:44:38,210
or something,
something crazy like that.

2409
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:41,510
So these,
I believe that the Mayan civilization

2410
01:44:41,511 --> 01:44:46,340
they think was not,
not more than 2000 years ago.

2411
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:49,040
Here it is.
Sean's bars,

2412
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:52,670
a pub in athlone.
Ireland is the oldest pub in Ireland.

2413
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:56,570
Goes back to 900.
Eight d older than 100 years old.

2414
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:01,600
Jesus Christ.
Two thousand 900 years old essentially.

2415
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:04,220
Oh,
980.

2416
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:07,670
Okay.
But think about that.

2417
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:10,570
That's a thousand.
Well,

2418
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:11,930
it says oldest pub in Europe.

2419
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:14,660
So what's the oldest?
The oldest pub in the world?

2420
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:18,440
That's a good question.
But just think of that 900.

2421
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:20,210
Add that.
So that's,

2422
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:25,450
that's three or 400 years before gingiss
con you old trip to Jerusalem.

2423
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,350
One,
1000.

2424
01:45:27,351 --> 01:45:28,180
One hundred.
$8.

2425
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:31,940
80 nine 8,980.
So that seems like the oldest.

2426
01:45:31,941 --> 01:45:34,160
Yeah it does.
And the 900 a day.

2427
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:37,310
Wow.
More than 1100 years ago.

2428
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:42,220
Fucking a man.
Just crazy that much older than America.

2429
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:44,840
Yeah.
So book one was the Mayan civilization

2430
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:46,930
when,
when was the,

2431
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,490
was the decline of the Mayan
civilization.

2432
01:45:49,491 --> 01:45:53,980
See if you find that
it is pretty amazing when you stop and

2433
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,860
think about it.
Think about just the bizarre history of

2434
01:45:58,290 --> 01:46:02,720
the human race and that there are these
civilizations that have these.

2435
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:07,430
They lived and he sort of isolated
environments where they developed in

2436
01:46:07,431 --> 01:46:12,431
many ways parallel sort of building
techniques but different than other

2437
01:46:12,771 --> 01:46:15,680
parts of the world that were also based
on constellations.

2438
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:20,220
Like very similar to a lot of the
hypothesis about Egyptian culture is

2439
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:23,600
that they had done that collapse.
It goes,

2440
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:25,800
wow,
980.

2441
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:27,940
That's insane.
So right,

2442
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:30,680
right on the light.
When that bar was built,

2443
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:33,470
maybe the bar fucking caused it.
They all went to Ireland.

2444
01:46:33,471 --> 01:46:35,780
Got Hammered.
That wow,

2445
01:46:35,781 --> 01:46:38,120
that's a coincidence that entered a 80
right there.

2446
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:42,080
Nine hundred 80 up and down,
but what a bizarre and complex

2447
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,740
civilization the Mayans were.
See if you could find out this is what

2448
01:46:45,741 --> 01:46:49,010
the Mayan language sounded like.
I found a,

2449
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:51,420
but it's psycho.
A woman living currently.

2450
01:46:51,421 --> 01:46:52,920
It's like,
this is what it could have sounded like.

2451
01:46:52,921 --> 01:46:55,700
I don't know if that's the best
one.

2452
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:58,530
Let's hear what she says.
Let me see what it may be me.

2453
01:46:58,550 --> 01:47:00,520
Maybe there's some of it left.
You know,

2454
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,750
you could take on anything.
I don't know if that's the same.

2455
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,613
Oh,
you could.

2456
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:05,120
Yeah.
They'll say you could open it.

2457
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:07,900
That's where the city near Guatemala.
Whoa.

2458
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:25,470
Yeah.
Maybe

2459
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:48,600
doesn't sound like anything that I've
ever heard before.

2460
01:47:49,870 --> 01:47:52,170
Spanish words drugged.
It says what you could.

2461
01:47:52,430 --> 01:47:54,820
Maya sounds really sounds like.
What is it?

2462
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:59,170
What's the description?
So this guy had his housekeeper describe

2463
01:47:59,171 --> 01:48:00,620
what this older woman was saying.
Oh,

2464
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:03,820
go back to look at it.
It says attention Mel Gibson.

2465
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:07,570
Yes.
She saw that movie apocalypto and had a

2466
01:48:07,571 --> 01:48:10,330
hard time understanding the mind that
they were speaking in that movie.

2467
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:13,390
If you listen closely,
you can hear a few Spanish words mixed

2468
01:48:13,391 --> 01:48:15,280
in where there are no mind words,

2469
01:48:16,270 --> 01:48:18,160
Huh?
Wow.

2470
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,590
Interesting.
Apocalypto.

2471
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:23,220
That's really interesting.
Maybe he claimed that they were speaking

2472
01:48:23,221 --> 01:48:25,200
at or something like that or what?
That movie,

2473
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:28,710
I don't want to get done in apocalypto
mean you're talking about a dead

2474
01:48:28,711 --> 01:48:31,090
language.
How could you get a guest to.

2475
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:35,100
What did he do with apocalypto?
Did he use Spanish?

2476
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,000
Did he mix it in with stuff?
I would imagine that we'd hire some sort

2477
01:48:39,001 --> 01:48:39,900
of language experts,

2478
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:42,040
but

2479
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:43,840
what else?
He might might've been busy getting

2480
01:48:43,841 --> 01:48:48,170
drunk and yelling at choose
curse curse.

2481
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:52,630
Now his ex wife
thing that I pulled up off of mental

2482
01:48:52,631 --> 01:48:53,820
floss is that,
uh,

2483
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:57,640
if like 15 fun facts about the movie,
it says that he was a stickler for

2484
01:48:57,641 --> 01:49:00,650
authentic language and all of the
dialogue is you could take Maya

2485
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:01,503
language.
So.

2486
01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:02,370
Oh,
well huh.

2487
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:06,430
That's where the discrepancy is in that
maybe he said he used it all and she's

2488
01:49:06,431 --> 01:49:11,050
saying I speak it not unrecognized.
What she's not saying that she spoke it.

2489
01:49:11,051 --> 01:49:14,710
If you read what she said she was saying
that she had given this woman a massage

2490
01:49:15,130 --> 01:49:19,030
and the woman was speaking to her and
that she recognized a few words in

2491
01:49:19,031 --> 01:49:20,440
Spanish,
but she didn't.

2492
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:23,260
Yeah,
I don't think there's a bridge between

2493
01:49:23,261 --> 01:49:25,030
that lag.
I don't think there's anybody who knows

2494
01:49:25,031 --> 01:49:28,720
that language and also speaks English
that can crazy man.

2495
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:34,630
That whole part of the world is so then
you go back to like the in the old macs,

2496
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,130
they don't even know who those people
were.

2497
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:39,520
Those strange,
almost African looking phases.

2498
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:42,280
They,
those gigantic stone structures that

2499
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:44,470
they found that there could be thousands
of years old.

2500
01:49:44,610 --> 01:49:46,990
Are you talking about off of the coast
of Ecuador?

2501
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:50,830
Yeah.
The old Mac are there almost like a

2502
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:53,380
hypothetical situation or,
or a,

2503
01:49:53,381 --> 01:49:54,700
uh,
they don't.

2504
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:58,210
They don't necessarily know where these
people came from.

2505
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:02,390
They don't know who they were and some
people have said they look a lot like,

2506
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:04,820
like really strong featured,
um,

2507
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:08,680
South American folks.
And some people have actually compared

2508
01:50:08,681 --> 01:50:11,270
the way the old mex were depicted in
these structures,

2509
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:15,130
these statues and things that they look
more like Africans,

2510
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,860
you know,
this has been like speculation that

2511
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:21,040
these are people that might have come
from Africa on boats.

2512
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:25,180
That's been widely criticized too.
But the point is they don't really know

2513
01:50:25,181 --> 01:50:28,990
much about the old Mex.
You ever seen images from the seat pull

2514
01:50:28,991 --> 01:50:33,991
up?
I'm old MAC statues o l m e C,

2515
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:36,580
I believe it's the way they spell it.
But again,

2516
01:50:36,581 --> 01:50:37,900
that's just phonetic.
They don't,

2517
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:40,810
I don't even know what language these
people spoke and these are.

2518
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:45,100
So these are some statues and things
that they found in South America.

2519
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:48,220
Look at these.
Oh yeah.

2520
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:49,150
Seen that.
He's so.

2521
01:50:49,151 --> 01:50:50,950
They have different legends of the
Hidden Temple.

2522
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,080
Did you ever see that show?
It was a joke.

2523
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:56,110
I said that.
I thought that was going to pull up the

2524
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:57,510
Nickelodeon TV show.
Oh No,

2525
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:58,770
no.
I'm thinking of no.

2526
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,010
The omex like,
look at that one.

2527
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:02,320
The third one over from the top.
Look at that.

2528
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,840
I mean that looks very African,
doesn't it?

2529
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:08,580
We really thick lips.
Wide noses,

2530
01:51:08,581 --> 01:51:10,430
large nostrils.
Really interesting.

2531
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:15,690
Mean these people,
they don't exactly know what their

2532
01:51:15,691 --> 01:51:19,010
culture was.
They don't exactly know who they were.

2533
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:24,000
It's hard to carbon date as well because
you're dealing with stone so until they

2534
01:51:24,001 --> 01:51:25,980
find,
you know,

2535
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:28,560
things that are around there that they
can back date.

2536
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:31,770
I think that the estimate is 6,000
years.

2537
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:34,560
I might've made that up though.

2538
01:51:35,710 --> 01:51:37,120
See?
See if you could find out.

2539
01:51:37,121 --> 01:51:40,660
Like what?
How long ago were the old Mex?

2540
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,780
The.
You could see it back where you just

2541
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:43,690
were.
What does it say?

2542
01:51:43,691 --> 01:51:45,580
They're going to be saved?
Jesus.

2543
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:48,220
Everything is done at RBC.
I was 80 they before.

2544
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:51,730
Oh yeah.
Why am I screwing that up?

2545
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:55,450
Dealing with this,
I'm in pain right now dealing with this.

2546
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:58,150
How's it doing better?
But fuck man,

2547
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:02,140
I was in Mexico this week and I got
severely sunburn on my back.

2548
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:05,110
Put sunscreen everywhere.
But my back,

2549
01:52:05,150 --> 01:52:10,150
I've had young Jamie in a very non
gateway lather on this.

2550
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:12,700
Uh,
Aloe Vera Anti.

2551
01:52:12,701 --> 01:52:16,030
But I'm very distracted.
It's just like a,

2552
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:19,930
like almost like I have 100 things all
over my back.

2553
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:22,870
Not No Bueno.
So that's 900 BC.

2554
01:52:22,871 --> 01:52:25,840
They think the old mex lived.
What's that estimate based on?

2555
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:29,650
Because I saw something that was like,
it thought it was there were way older

2556
01:52:29,651 --> 01:52:33,100
than that.
Wonderful.

2557
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:36,320
I know the date from at least before 900
BC.

2558
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:38,320
That's.
See,

2559
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:41,900
I think there's like a conventional way
of thinking and then there's an

2560
01:52:41,901 --> 01:52:46,550
alternative theory and the alternative
it was that they were way,

2561
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:47,780
way,
way older than that,

2562
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:50,270
but I don't think they know.
They don't know who the Omex were,

2563
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:52,930
but cool shit,
you know,

2564
01:52:52,931 --> 01:52:57,400
they left behind these giant heads and
like,

2565
01:52:57,470 --> 01:53:00,940
oh why'd you even do that?
No one knows.

2566
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:05,290
Have you seen that thing?
I was watching this one documentary or

2567
01:53:05,291 --> 01:53:10,080
one television show where either on the
Amazon and uh,

2568
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,940
they've,
they've recently because of satellite

2569
01:53:12,941 --> 01:53:17,941
images found in city while they found
what they think are the thing is

2570
01:53:18,161 --> 01:53:22,750
evidence of hidden cities have evidence
of ancient cultures now in the Amazon.

2571
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:25,000
Um,
and I think it was Brazil,

2572
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:28,060
I don't think it was Honduras,
but they found,

2573
01:53:28,061 --> 01:53:31,480
um,
like what would appears to be irrigation

2574
01:53:31,481 --> 01:53:35,500
structures and things that are carved
into the ground and things that look

2575
01:53:35,501 --> 01:53:39,340
like grids where they might've had
cities and streets.

2576
01:53:39,910 --> 01:53:43,390
That was the lost city of gold member
there were said last Silverado.

2577
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:44,231
Yeah,
yeah.

2578
01:53:44,231 --> 01:53:46,720
The people are looking for.
And that one,

2579
01:53:46,721 --> 01:53:50,680
a European explored,
went looking for and wound up dying and

2580
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:54,760
they believe it got eaten by cannibals
because they're making a movie about

2581
01:53:54,761 --> 01:53:55,480
that.
Right.

2582
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:59,470
We talked about this recently,
some movie about the lost city of gold

2583
01:53:59,471 --> 01:54:00,700
that's on its way.

2584
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:04,090
I had a,
I think it was Disney did one event

2585
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:07,780
animation one like 20 years ago.
That was a bug.

2586
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:10,910
Well,
there's always been rumors that there

2587
01:54:10,911 --> 01:54:14,630
was these lost cities in the Amazon,
but now thanks to satellite imagery,

2588
01:54:14,631 --> 01:54:18,230
they're starting to see things they
never saw before and starting to find

2589
01:54:18,231 --> 01:54:20,960
patterns and structures and it's cool
shit man.

2590
01:54:20,961 --> 01:54:23,030
His cool.
Well it's what's really crazy is like if

2591
01:54:23,031 --> 01:54:27,230
we didn't have this stuff,
like how long would it be before there

2592
01:54:27,231 --> 01:54:29,960
was no evidence,
would it be another thousand years?

2593
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:34,430
So like how if you go back to when was,
when were these structures with they

2594
01:54:34,431 --> 01:54:36,440
2000 years old,
were they a thousand years old?

2595
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:40,400
So if we,
if we think about it like who knows what

2596
01:54:40,401 --> 01:54:44,150
was there in the Amazon,
who knows what was their 5,000 years

2597
01:54:44,151 --> 01:54:45,500
ago,
10,000 years ago.

2598
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:50,060
I mean it could have been completely
lost civilizations that we just,

2599
01:54:50,810 --> 01:54:53,200
we'll never know.
We'll never have any awareness of

2600
01:54:55,330 --> 01:54:56,163
you freaking out,
man.

2601
01:54:56,230 --> 01:54:59,080
Look at you.
I'm never to know.

2602
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:03,650
Do you have any plans other than you
said you were going to visit Eastern

2603
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:05,000
Europe.
He lived in Guatemala.

2604
01:55:05,001 --> 01:55:07,580
Now you're going to live there for
awhile and do you have any other like

2605
01:55:07,581 --> 01:55:09,410
wild plans and places to go and

2606
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:12,380
uh,
talking about Thailand again at the,

2607
01:55:12,381 --> 01:55:13,340
uh,
at the end of the year?

2608
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,020
Um,
other than that,

2609
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,101
no,
that's,

2610
01:55:16,101 --> 01:55:18,620
that's about as far ahead as I thought.
I mean honestly,

2611
01:55:18,621 --> 01:55:21,380
like I,
I came to my buddy was in Ohio,

2612
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:22,400
I don't know if you.
Oh,

2613
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,160
hi.
It's a town.

2614
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:23,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

2615
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,300
Um,
and we went into surfing yesterday,

2616
01:55:26,301 --> 01:55:31,301
up there and I was just like,
I liked it and we were surfing around

2617
01:55:32,231 --> 01:55:34,510
lunchtime and then we went for a hike in
the afternoon.

2618
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:36,670
It's just gorgeous.
I mean it's like the fact that you can

2619
01:55:36,671 --> 01:55:39,880
go surfing in the day and then for a,
I'm in a gorgeous.

2620
01:55:39,910 --> 01:55:42,190
You could look like these trails just
snake on forever.

2621
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:44,530
I was like,
California

2622
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:45,330
was like,
okay,

2623
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:48,330
maybe California is on the radar.
California is pretty bad ass.

2624
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,820
Yeah.
Northern California is really intense,

2625
01:55:50,821 --> 01:55:52,680
like the rain forest area where the
redwoods are.

2626
01:55:52,681 --> 01:55:55,670
Have you been up there
yet?

2627
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:56,750
Yeah,
I've been up there.

2628
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,130
Those big,
this big red was this gorgeous Pacific

2629
01:55:59,131 --> 01:56:00,750
northwest.
Looks beautiful too.

2630
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,400
I've never been up there.
Yeah,

2631
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:05,220
it is.
It's really interesting and super dense.

2632
01:56:05,221 --> 01:56:07,740
Forest up there,
like really dense because it's

2633
01:56:07,741 --> 01:56:10,050
constantly raining.
And what's really interesting about the

2634
01:56:10,051 --> 01:56:14,340
forest is the other so many pine trees
and there's so many leaves fall at the

2635
01:56:14,341 --> 01:56:17,160
forest floor is really soft.
Yeah.

2636
01:56:17,161 --> 01:56:19,350
He like,
yeah,

2637
01:56:19,351 --> 01:56:22,020
like you're stepping on this cushion
everywhere you walk.

2638
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:25,100
It looks beautiful though.
It is a lot of ferns and [inaudible].

2639
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:26,213
Yeah,
it's very,

2640
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:29,850
very alive.
What do you do if you have hunted up

2641
01:56:29,851 --> 01:56:31,260
there before?
Uh,

2642
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:32,670
I also went up there looking for
bigfoot.

2643
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:35,520
That TV show that I did.
You did?

2644
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:36,301
Yeah.
Yeah,

2645
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:38,400
we went,
we went big foot hunting up there for a

2646
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:39,233
week.
Did you find them?

2647
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:43,050
We found a lot of white guys out camp
and looking for bigfoot.

2648
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:44,360
Really?
Yeah.

2649
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:46,440
It was a joke that I said,
here's what you don't find when you go

2650
01:56:46,450 --> 01:56:50,200
looking for bigfoot.
Black people are more likely to find big

2651
01:56:50,201 --> 01:56:53,220
foot.
Then you are black people looking for

2652
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:56,180
big bunch of white guys camping.
He's accurate.

2653
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,740
And it was interesting because one of
the guys that we've talked to is like,

2654
01:56:58,741 --> 01:57:00,560
hey look,
even when we don't find anything least

2655
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:02,040
we're out here camping.
I was like,

2656
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:03,930
Eh,
that's the worst case scenario is pretty

2657
01:57:03,931 --> 01:57:05,670
good.
But there's a lot of people out there

2658
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:09,750
that claim they seen things but I just
think they're seeing bears because there

2659
01:57:09,751 --> 01:57:11,880
are bears up there,
there's a lot of black bears up there

2660
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:15,780
and you see them in the distance and
bears do walk on two legs all the time.

2661
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:19,440
And I think if you see one in the
distance and you see that image and you

2662
01:57:19,441 --> 01:57:24,260
convince yourself that that's bear or
that's a big foot rather not a bear.

2663
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:28,200
And after awhile your memory starts to
memories are so bad.

2664
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:31,470
Like the human memory.
So in inherently shitty.

2665
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:34,500
I mean a few people have like very clear
distinct memories from the past.

2666
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:38,400
But I think even though you're sort of
repeating them to yourself and

2667
01:57:38,401 --> 01:57:41,190
ingraining them in your head until you
believe it until you believe him.

2668
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:44,190
But I think like what,
what our memories are good for is like

2669
01:57:44,191 --> 01:57:47,100
recent events or things that are
catastrophic,

2670
01:57:47,101 --> 01:57:49,350
like don't go near the snake,
the snake will kill you.

2671
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,900
You know that spiders got venom.
Oh,

2672
01:57:51,930 --> 01:57:53,160
I remember the spider,
you know,

2673
01:57:53,161 --> 01:57:58,161
but like as far as like seeing things
and being around especially unusual

2674
01:57:58,171 --> 01:58:01,860
events that are very unique,
like seeing a seven foot tall monkey in

2675
01:58:01,861 --> 01:58:04,170
the woods or believing you saw that
thing.

2676
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:05,030
Yeah,
no doubt.

2677
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:07,360
I think he's seen as a,
the studies of the hub,

2678
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:12,120
like a criminal break into a room and
then they'll ask all the other witnesses

2679
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:14,910
how tall was he?
Like was he black?

2680
01:58:14,911 --> 01:58:16,890
Was He white?
Like all these specific characteristics

2681
01:58:16,891 --> 01:58:19,830
and like they're all over the place.
Yeah.

2682
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:24,380
Yeah.
Human memory is unbelievably bad and we

2683
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:27,660
count on it so much and people are
always like telling you stories about

2684
01:58:27,661 --> 01:58:30,230
their childhood.
I remember when this hub and he was

2685
01:58:30,231 --> 01:58:31,260
like,
do you really?

2686
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:33,560
How much do you really remember?
It's like,

2687
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:36,780
you might really.
And how delusional are you?

2688
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:38,500
That's the other part of the problem.
Like how,

2689
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,500
how much do you remember of things like
what is,

2690
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:46,030
how much do you distort reality to her
to fit within your narrative that you

2691
01:58:46,031 --> 01:58:47,440
enjoy?
Make a good story,

2692
01:58:47,441 --> 01:58:48,230
right?
Yes.

2693
01:58:48,230 --> 01:58:49,063
Enjoy.
Yeah.

2694
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:51,760
You must run into a lot of those people
when you're out there on the,

2695
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:53,200
on the hat,
as it were,

2696
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:57,910
was this sasquatch chased dear onto
highway woman tells deputy wow.

2697
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:02,860
She sounds pretty fucking legit.
She's 1550 year old tents.

2698
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:06,010
It was tented tensed.
It's the city.

2699
01:59:06,011 --> 01:59:09,190
I guess 10 said woman.
Fifty years old.

2700
01:59:09,191 --> 01:59:11,860
She's probably on pills.
Whacked out of her mind.

2701
01:59:11,861 --> 01:59:12,900
Maybe drunk.
No.

2702
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:13,940
No,
so,

2703
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,540
so legit dude.
But it's an Idaho again.

2704
01:59:16,570 --> 01:59:18,940
Idaho high bear population.
I know.

2705
01:59:18,941 --> 01:59:21,580
I was fucking grizzly bears.
It's probably out there,

2706
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:24,430
whacked out on fucking pills.
She sees a bear.

2707
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:26,860
She can't wait to call the police.
Finally,

2708
01:59:26,861 --> 01:59:29,200
my life has meaning.
Had 50 years old.

2709
01:59:29,201 --> 01:59:31,240
I'm the first one in my town.
It's a big.

2710
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:35,560
She goes and tells people.
Did you run into any wildlife?

2711
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:37,030
It was weird when you're out there.

2712
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:39,080
I don't know if bears are considered
weird,

2713
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:40,400
but yeah,
embarrassed.

2714
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:41,383
There was,
um,

2715
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:44,440
it was 2013.
They were like,

2716
01:59:44,450 --> 01:59:46,970
you know,
Congress seems to shut down about once

2717
01:59:46,971 --> 01:59:50,840
every decade for budget disagreements.
Yeah.

2718
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:53,090
In 2013 they shut down.
And um,

2719
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:54,831
uh,
yeah,

2720
01:59:54,831 --> 01:59:56,900
so they shut down the whole national
park system.

2721
01:59:56,930 --> 01:59:59,840
So you eat,
he goes through a lot of national parks.

2722
01:59:59,841 --> 02:00:01,760
So when they should have the national
park system,

2723
02:00:01,761 --> 02:00:04,200
nobody's allowed to go into the park,
meaning.

2724
02:00:04,220 --> 02:00:05,840
So it's like,
what the hell are we supposed to do?

2725
02:00:05,841 --> 02:00:08,480
Even hiking for four months and now
you're just going to say you can't go

2726
02:00:08,481 --> 02:00:12,290
through these sections.
So it ended up everybody just kind of

2727
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:14,900
kept on hiking,
but the ranges would kick you out.

2728
02:00:14,901 --> 02:00:17,720
So she had to do is you'd hike at night.
Oh God,

2729
02:00:17,721 --> 02:00:19,400
I'm.
So you're hiking at night.

2730
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:21,830
But the best thing about hiking unite as
a wildlife,

2731
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:23,360
you know,
because it's like you start.

2732
02:00:23,810 --> 02:00:26,510
And so like specifically Shenandoah
national park,

2733
02:00:27,050 --> 02:00:30,200
um,
it gets a ton of visitors.

2734
02:00:30,201 --> 02:00:31,760
And so when they shut down the national
park,

2735
02:00:31,761 --> 02:00:35,870
the only people in there were us.
It was like three hikers for this 100

2736
02:00:35,871 --> 02:00:38,360
mile section of park.
So it was like,

2737
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:41,120
and the Shenandoah national park,
I believe is one of the highest

2738
02:00:41,121 --> 02:00:43,310
concentrated black bird populations in
the country.

2739
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:46,850
Oh Jesus.
So you have like no disturbance and you

2740
02:00:46,851 --> 02:00:48,110
have all these barriers.
So,

2741
02:00:48,590 --> 02:00:49,311
um,
you know,

2742
02:00:49,311 --> 02:00:50,990
we'd be hiking the night I was actually
alone,

2743
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:51,861
um,
at this point.

2744
02:00:51,861 --> 02:00:52,940
But um,
yeah,

2745
02:00:52,941 --> 02:00:54,910
I was hiking through the night one night
and yeah,

2746
02:00:54,950 --> 02:00:59,950
like the sun was rising and you know,
like a bear's will go to sleep at night

2747
02:01:00,411 --> 02:01:05,411
and the trees and when you pass by them
you triberr and they'll come out of the

2748
02:01:05,781 --> 02:01:09,370
tree and the claw their way down the
tree and you know,

2749
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:10,730
it's a slow their fall.

2750
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:13,880
But it was like,
I think I saw 15 beers that morning.

2751
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:17,510
I was just cool though.
It was cool.

2752
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:20,390
It was just like,
now when you're hiking a using

2753
02:01:20,391 --> 02:01:23,030
headlamps,
are you just going by the moonlight or

2754
02:01:23,090 --> 02:01:24,110
both?
I mean,

2755
02:01:24,111 --> 02:01:25,610
yeah,
moonlight if you can.

2756
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:27,110
Uh,
it's surprising like your,

2757
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:29,090
you know,
your eyes adjust and the night I have a

2758
02:01:29,091 --> 02:01:31,430
lot of times,
but if you're under like heavy trees,

2759
02:01:31,431 --> 02:01:32,330
you know,
that's not going to work.

2760
02:01:32,331 --> 02:01:33,320
But yeah,
hadn't headlamps.

2761
02:01:33,321 --> 02:01:35,270
Definitely.
And how long was Congress?

2762
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:37,040
How long did they shut down?
And national parks.

2763
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:39,520
I remember who went too long.
There was a couple weeks something.

2764
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:42,890
I mean some hikers we knew like
literally holed up in a hotel for a

2765
02:01:42,891 --> 02:01:45,810
couple of weeks until they settled it
committed.

2766
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:49,580
It's just like,
what is a range of really gonna arrest

2767
02:01:49,581 --> 02:01:52,490
you and throw you in jail for like
hiking a through hiker,

2768
02:01:52,491 --> 02:01:55,460
like hiking through the park.
It's weird that they tell you you can't

2769
02:01:55,461 --> 02:01:56,720
go anymore.
I mean,

2770
02:01:56,721 --> 02:02:00,800
isn't this like public lands?
I think we all kind of rolled her eyes

2771
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:02,360
are most of us rolled our eyes at it
like.

2772
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:03,620
All right dude,
come on.

2773
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,940
I'm just,
I'm just walking through here,

2774
02:02:04,941 --> 02:02:05,770
you know.
So

2775
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:07,570
this company that you have,
um,

2776
02:02:07,870 --> 02:02:10,420
green belly meals,
which I've enjoyed these things very

2777
02:02:10,421 --> 02:02:11,170
much.
You,

2778
02:02:11,170 --> 02:02:15,580
you came up with this because you needed
more nutrition while you were out there.

2779
02:02:15,581 --> 02:02:17,980
It's hard to find good stuff to eat.

2780
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:18,970
Yeah,
exactly.

2781
02:02:18,970 --> 02:02:20,860
Um,
and prior to the ato is doing,

2782
02:02:20,861 --> 02:02:23,740
um,
I was the of the term cycle touring.

2783
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:29,070
You've like backpacking on a bike,
you hop on a bicycle and you cycle,

2784
02:02:29,261 --> 02:02:31,570
you know,
5,100 miles a day and then you camp out

2785
02:02:31,571 --> 02:02:34,060
at night.
So did that New Zealand for three or

2786
02:02:34,061 --> 02:02:38,020
four months and it was the same thing.
It's just like burning a ton of

2787
02:02:38,021 --> 02:02:38,770
calories.
Men,

2788
02:02:38,770 --> 02:02:41,450
um,
and I needed everything to be light and

2789
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:42,700
ready to eat,
um,

2790
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:47,200
and then yet came over to the states and
right after that trip on the Appalachian

2791
02:02:47,201 --> 02:02:49,990
trail and the backpacking food consisted
of,

2792
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:51,850
you know,
those dehydrated freeze dried meals that

2793
02:02:51,851 --> 02:02:54,040
you add hot water to,
um,

2794
02:02:54,670 --> 02:02:59,670
those things like I don't like stopping
and cooking at all,

2795
02:02:59,890 --> 02:03:01,600
you know,
like if I can keep going,

2796
02:03:01,601 --> 02:03:03,790
particularly at meals like lunch,
just keep going.

2797
02:03:04,230 --> 02:03:07,420
Um,
and like the meal options were bars,

2798
02:03:07,421 --> 02:03:09,970
other bars,
bars usually cap out at like 200

2799
02:03:09,971 --> 02:03:12,190
calories,
250 even meal replacements.

2800
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:14,830
The,
the highest calorie meal replacement bar

2801
02:03:14,831 --> 02:03:15,664
on the market.
Um,

2802
02:03:15,670 --> 02:03:17,310
it was a 400 calorie,
uh,

2803
02:03:17,410 --> 02:03:18,590
I believe met Rx,
you know,

2804
02:03:18,591 --> 02:03:21,340
some of those workout,
a high protein bars.

2805
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:23,050
Um,
and not to mention that like heavily

2806
02:03:23,051 --> 02:03:23,910
processed,
you know,

2807
02:03:23,911 --> 02:03:25,270
I was like,
I just didn't want to put up much of

2808
02:03:25,271 --> 02:03:26,380
that crap in me.
Um,

2809
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:29,980
and I mean to add another thing was the
just balanced nutrition.

2810
02:03:29,981 --> 02:03:31,540
Some bars would have fiber,
some,

2811
02:03:31,541 --> 02:03:33,460
wouldn't someone have protein,
some wouldn't.

2812
02:03:33,461 --> 02:03:35,620
Someone have carbs and witnessed like,
dude,

2813
02:03:35,621 --> 02:03:36,970
I need nutrition.
Like I'm,

2814
02:03:37,030 --> 02:03:39,670
I'm really burning up to five to 6,000
calories a day,

2815
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:40,540
you know.
Um,

2816
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:45,040
so that kind of idea of,
of the need for a big nutrition ready to

2817
02:03:45,041 --> 02:03:47,170
eat fast,
um,

2818
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:47,950
you know,
kind of eaten,

2819
02:03:47,950 --> 02:03:52,900
go kind of meal with something that had
been forming in my mind is I hiked a lot

2820
02:03:52,901 --> 02:03:56,230
of times we were drinking olive oil
practically and drinking honey and

2821
02:03:56,740 --> 02:04:00,220
drinking peanut butter.
It's just like anything you could get to

2822
02:04:00,221 --> 02:04:02,440
load in the calories.
So I'm,

2823
02:04:02,441 --> 02:04:03,820
you know,
I'm not a big dude so I was like I

2824
02:04:03,821 --> 02:04:06,550
couldn't afford to lose that much weight
and I was losing weight.

2825
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:09,880
I'm so green belly kind of came up with
the idea when I was hiking.

2826
02:04:09,881 --> 02:04:12,820
Like,
let's make something that packs in some

2827
02:04:12,821 --> 02:04:13,780
calories,
you know,

2828
02:04:13,850 --> 02:04:15,080
pack.
How did you do that though?

2829
02:04:15,081 --> 02:04:17,360
How did you like these things are super
dense,

2830
02:04:17,361 --> 02:04:22,280
like for people that are listening,
I'm holding this bag and as two bars in

2831
02:04:22,281 --> 02:04:25,340
it and a dude I eat,
I've eaten these before.

2832
02:04:25,341 --> 02:04:29,120
I've eaten two bars and I'm good for
fucking a day,

2833
02:04:30,870 --> 02:04:33,290
just a normal day.
Like not hiking or anything crazy,

2834
02:04:33,291 --> 02:04:35,720
but it's really dense.
They're heavy,

2835
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:40,780
like you hear that phone.
So it's a brick of food.

2836
02:04:41,410 --> 02:04:43,920
Like how did you figure out how to do
that?

2837
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:46,980
Uh,
I knew nutritionally I had an idea of

2838
02:04:46,981 --> 02:04:50,370
where I wanted it to be or you know,
as a concept for like this kind of

2839
02:04:50,371 --> 02:04:52,410
ultimate backpacking meal.
Um,

2840
02:04:52,450 --> 02:04:55,380
and then I worked with a food scientist,
so I knew that I knew nothing about

2841
02:04:55,381 --> 02:04:58,860
nutrition.
I just kind of knew I wanted to scratch

2842
02:04:58,861 --> 02:04:59,970
my own itch,
you know,

2843
02:04:59,971 --> 02:05:03,300
I had an itch and I wanted a,
I wanted a better backpacking meal.

2844
02:05:03,301 --> 02:05:06,210
So I knew conceptually what I wanted it
to be.

2845
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:10,210
And then after playing around my mom's
kitchen trying to get something,

2846
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:12,390
I was like,
this is way over my head,

2847
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:14,670
you know,
like trying to get the nutritional

2848
02:05:14,730 --> 02:05:16,920
nutritional profile where I want it to
be good at,

2849
02:05:16,930 --> 02:05:20,130
to taste good,
like ingredients that don't react with

2850
02:05:20,131 --> 02:05:24,510
each other and spoil and then trying to
get it to literally form together and

2851
02:05:24,511 --> 02:05:25,230
not fall apart.

2852
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:29,400
It's like you start like having this
really complicated stuff as I try to

2853
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:30,560
just find her,
you know,

2854
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:32,520
um,
search around and see,

2855
02:05:32,521 --> 02:05:33,750
you know,
what kind of person who can help me.

2856
02:05:33,751 --> 02:05:37,380
I was looking right in nutritionists and
chefs and all that kind of stuff and

2857
02:05:37,381 --> 02:05:41,610
ended up coming with the term food
scientists and food scientists helped me

2858
02:05:41,611 --> 02:05:43,590
really formulate the meal.
And then,

2859
02:05:43,591 --> 02:05:44,161
um,
you know,

2860
02:05:44,161 --> 02:05:48,540
then it was just kind of a feedback game
from what he could do a from a

2861
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:52,860
nutritional point of view from a shelf
life and flavor profile.

2862
02:05:53,190 --> 02:05:55,200
Then it was just making sure the darn
things tasted good,

2863
02:05:55,201 --> 02:05:56,000
you know?
Um,

2864
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,240
so I went to like a hiking festival,
handed out hundreds of samples,

2865
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:03,660
just got a bunch of feedback from hikers
and then um,

2866
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:05,730
yeah,
kind of ran with it and um,

2867
02:06:05,970 --> 02:06:06,990
yeah,
that's been doing well.

2868
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:09,990
Well,
they're good man and I eat them all the

2869
02:06:09,991 --> 02:06:10,771
time.
So,

2870
02:06:10,771 --> 02:06:11,690
uh,
I,

2871
02:06:11,770 --> 02:06:13,180
I'm a,
I'm a,

2872
02:06:13,310 --> 02:06:14,160
I'm,
I'm impressed.

2873
02:06:14,430 --> 02:06:15,900
I really delicious.
You know,

2874
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:17,430
my favorite one is a chocolate one
though.

2875
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:18,490
Was that which one?

2876
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:19,460
Dark chocolate?
Yeah,

2877
02:06:19,461 --> 02:06:20,330
dot dot.dot banana.
Yeah.

2878
02:06:20,331 --> 02:06:21,640
We have been in chips and then,
but

2879
02:06:21,910 --> 02:06:24,160
good shit dude.
Real Scott.

2880
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:27,880
I'm trying to stay on a ketogenic diet.
A funny joke.

2881
02:06:28,330 --> 02:06:29,230
I was like,
yeah man,

2882
02:06:29,231 --> 02:06:30,700
we got,
we got high carbs.

2883
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:32,770
Yeah,
that's not going to work on a cheat

2884
02:06:32,771 --> 02:06:33,640
mail.
These are good.

2885
02:06:33,641 --> 02:06:36,410
Or if I'm desperado for food,
but also she,

2886
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:41,520
you can think about a ketogenic diets as
you can every now and then fuck up as

2887
02:06:42,521 --> 02:06:43,870
long as you're not,
you know,

2888
02:06:43,871 --> 02:06:47,080
as long as you're pretty consistent with
a high fat content diet.

2889
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:52,220
And then what I'll do is I'll take an
exogenous ketone can take a like,

2890
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:55,870
drinks that you mix up that put you in a
ketogenic state even after you could

2891
02:06:55,871 --> 02:06:59,230
drink like a whole coca cola and then
drink one of these key to genic drinks

2892
02:06:59,231 --> 02:07:01,210
and it knocks you back in a state of
ketosis.

2893
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:02,440
Well,
yeah,

2894
02:07:02,441 --> 02:07:04,450
it was pretty scientific shit.
This guy,

2895
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,400
dom d'agostino invented it.

2896
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:08,890
He's a scientist at the University of
Florida.

2897
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:10,450
Interesting.
Yeah.

2898
02:07:10,451 --> 02:07:12,100
There's,
there's ways you can manipulate your

2899
02:07:12,101 --> 02:07:16,030
metabolism that way where it
specifically burns fat.

2900
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:18,410
There's a lot of benefits.
One of the big benefits is your,

2901
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:20,050
um,
your appetite.

2902
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:24,370
Appetite suppressants amazing because if
I go on and I did,

2903
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:26,710
I do switch over,
like if I cheat,

2904
02:07:26,770 --> 02:07:29,440
like if I go on vacation or something
like that and I just started eating

2905
02:07:29,441 --> 02:07:31,150
tacos or whatever.
When you,

2906
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:33,910
uh,
your body goes into carbohydrate burning

2907
02:07:33,911 --> 02:07:35,950
state,
you way hungrier,

2908
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,190
like you burned through that
carbohydrate pretty quickly.

2909
02:07:39,191 --> 02:07:43,030
It's quick burning fuel and then your
body doesn't have the carbs anymore.

2910
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:44,650
So then you go into this real hungry
state.

2911
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:48,220
Whereas if you're in a ketogenic state,
your body's burning fat,

2912
02:07:48,221 --> 02:07:50,860
you're eating fats,
and then when there's no more food,

2913
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:55,840
your body starts burning it's own fat,
and so you don't get that crazy hunger

2914
02:07:55,841 --> 02:07:58,900
craving that you get when you're in a
car based Diet and there's,

2915
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:01,570
you know,
there's arguments for both sides and um,

2916
02:08:01,571 --> 02:08:02,980
I'm going to bring in some people that,
uh,

2917
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:06,310
are anti ketogenic diet as well,
so get

2918
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:08,600
balanced perspective on it.
I listened to 'em,

2919
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:11,070
I don't remember his name,
but it was a nutritionist.

2920
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:14,130
He had written a book.
He was on your podcast a while ago.

2921
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:18,060
[inaudible] Chris crusher.
Gary tobbs the case against sugar.

2922
02:08:18,150 --> 02:08:20,610
Please not a nutritionist.
This is pretty recently.

2923
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:25,290
Robb wolf real recently.
I wanna say it was real recent wired to

2924
02:08:25,291 --> 02:08:26,640
eat robb wolf.
That sounds,

2925
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:27,613
that sounds right,
rob.

2926
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:31,380
But the level of nutrition that,
that guy knew,

2927
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:32,800
I was fascinated.
That's rob.

2928
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:33,840
Yeah,
that must be wrong,

2929
02:08:33,890 --> 02:08:34,723
man.

2930
02:08:35,390 --> 02:08:37,300
Whoa.
That was impressive.

2931
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:41,500
He's the actual guy that invented the
concept of quote unquote bulletproof

2932
02:08:41,501 --> 02:08:44,980
coffee that got kind of stole it.
Robb Wolf's concept came first and he

2933
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:49,981
wrote about it in 2005,
the idea of adding mct oil and butter to

2934
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:52,420
give healthy fats with coffee.
Yeah.

2935
02:08:52,421 --> 02:08:55,540
Rob is a scientist and he's.
He's like way ahead of the curve.

2936
02:08:56,150 --> 02:08:59,790
June and oppressive like Kilz
conversation was just interesting.

2937
02:09:00,370 --> 02:09:01,780
Yeah,
there's a lot of those guys out there

2938
02:09:01,781 --> 02:09:04,180
now.
It's really a fascinating time when it

2939
02:09:04,181 --> 02:09:08,170
comes to nutrition and and also what he
was really good about him is he's

2940
02:09:08,171 --> 02:09:10,870
constantly experimenting.
He's very honest and very open about his

2941
02:09:10,871 --> 02:09:14,940
experiments and he's also really adamant
about the possibility,

2942
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,090
not the,
not the hospital,

2943
02:09:16,091 --> 02:09:20,860
but the reality rather that people are
very different and everyone's

2944
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:24,400
variability.
The variability is very wide.

2945
02:09:24,730 --> 02:09:28,840
So like what is healthy for you might
not necessarily be healthy for me.

2946
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:32,050
And what,
what changes your blood sugar levels is

2947
02:09:32,051 --> 02:09:33,700
not going to change mine.
It's a very,

2948
02:09:33,701 --> 02:09:34,534
very different

2949
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:37,360
interesting stuff.
So it's like when you remember when

2950
02:09:37,361 --> 02:09:40,010
those conversation I was thinking like,
is there something out there?

2951
02:09:40,011 --> 02:09:43,460
Just a simple blood test or something
where it's just like,

2952
02:09:43,490 --> 02:09:45,490
what do I need to know?
What's good for me?

2953
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:48,320
What's the,
what's the simplest way to find out is

2954
02:09:48,321 --> 02:09:49,400
this good?
Is this bad?

2955
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:50,420
What do I need?
Yeah,

2956
02:09:50,610 --> 02:09:53,520
really just have to experiment and then
on top of that there's a lot of other

2957
02:09:53,521 --> 02:09:55,050
variables like how much sleep are you
getting?

2958
02:09:55,051 --> 02:09:56,330
What's your cortisol levels?
Well,

2959
02:09:56,331 --> 02:09:59,580
how much stress are you under?
And those factors also have to be taken

2960
02:09:59,581 --> 02:10:02,460
into consideration when you formulate a
diet because you're.

2961
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:05,340
It'll vary depending upon your stress
levels.

2962
02:10:05,370 --> 02:10:05,840
It's

2963
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:07,130
complicated stuff.
Very,

2964
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:10,460
very complicated.
But these delicious shit.
