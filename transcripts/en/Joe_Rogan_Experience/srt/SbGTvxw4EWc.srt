1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,680
The joe rogan experience and age,
live body George and learn how to fight.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,290
Oh right.
I thought what Brian did play football

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,950
this whole time.
She's a Swat team is

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,820
Lebron James Basketball,
but sports is whatever Tom tells me.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,710
If you don't watch anything outside of
that.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,700
No,
I like tennis.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,140
I used to watch like ladies golf.
Do you stick

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,910
that she isn't gay?
Is that the case that I've heard that

9
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,560
said before?
What's that ladies?

10
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,360
Golf is like a lot of k checks.
I think there's a little bit of a port.

11
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:35,100
100% of course.
Always do.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,990
Look at the sticks.
They is.

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,430
There's definitely,
there's trying today.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,960
There's definitely loves angry Twitter.
That's what it is.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,660
I don't know who watches ladies' golf.
I'm not sure what they are amazing

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,710
golfers that are golfers essentially
just a bunch of Lesbos.

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,640
Yeah.
It's amazing how good they are though.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,900
Fuck man.
Well,

19
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:05,250
it's one of the few groups that lesbians
available to really grow like lesbians

20
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,300
can't,
they have a hard time getting a

21
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:07,680
community.
You know,

22
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,530
like gay dudes have massive communities
all over the country,

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,560
like parts of the tenderloin.
And if you go to the Santa Monica area,

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,210
West Hollywood,
Santa Monica Boulevard area,

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,350
there are dates they've,
they've,

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,300
they've all conglomerated,
they know where the party's at.

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,260
The but then fucking that place on
Hollywood boulevard,

28
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,320
the West on Santa Monica Boulevard,
West Hollywood spot.

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,890
That is the gay spot on earth,
that area,

30
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,440
that whole area while you're driving.
Know Santa Monica,

31
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,630
is that club rage still there?
That's the flagship club because that's

32
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,630
the one that's on the big,
that was the one that,

33
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,380
you know,
we're doe Haney is W I was coming down

34
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:56,730
don't uni and I'm at the red light there
and it was a Saturday night and it was

35
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,870
fucking beautiful weather and everybody
was out and it was a gay party on the

36
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,704
streets,
man.

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,280
And there was these two dudes and they
both have their hands,

38
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:09,780
their fingers looped into each other's
belt loops.

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,050
And they were like in a lot,
cause I kinda scissoring and just

40
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:18,051
grinding Dick's together.
I can only wash us a certain amount of

41
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:23,270
time before some days slips and I gotta
get Outta here like this.

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,010
It was,
it was like a fucking bomb had been

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,340
ignited and I had to get outside of the
blast radius [inaudible] happy as fuck a

44
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,070
bear bar in silver lake,
so you'd have to walk past the bear bar.

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,380
The best trader Joe.
Whoa,

46
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:48,381
that's a specific type of gay bar.
Tuesday nights is like rim job.

47
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:52,230
Tuesdays at the big sign out front,
it's rem job Tuesdays

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,830
and
you'd hear like you drive by,

49
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,720
you can have be having like the like the
most quiet,

50
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,850
lame kind of night and you're like,
there's nothing going on.

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,660
And then as you pulled up you're like,
Ooh.

52
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,971
You're like,
oh,

53
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,210
there's the Dick's grinding and like
you're like,

54
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,460
ah,
neighborhood is alive right now.

55
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,010
And the best part there was a security
guard that would stand out.

56
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,410
Oh yeah.
Because he was in front of a gay bar.

57
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,000
You didn't know if it was just a
costume.

58
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,260
The first few times I was going on out
tonight and he's like,

59
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,490
no,
I'm just [inaudible].

60
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,610
He had a mustache
mustache.

61
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,060
Very few.
The pull off the John Stossel sick upper

62
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,360
must commit to that.
That's strange.

63
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,020
That's how I was wondering that because
people usually mock the mustache,

64
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,090
you know,
are they rock the ironic mustache,

65
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,810
but in the gay community it's like,
Yo,

66
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm down for you.
I saw a guy the other day,

67
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,950
it was beautiful.
He had timberlands on and yet cutoff

68
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,500
Jean shorts and he had like,
uh,

69
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,860
like uh,
one of those leather scally caps on and

70
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:02,440
he had a Jean jacket that was
sleeveless.

71
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,280
Nice.
He was fucking dictate.

72
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,010
This was like right after I worked in
San Francisco,

73
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,340
San Francisco with Greg Fitzsimmons.
Greg Fitzsimmons fucking killed me.

74
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,160
He got on stage and he goes,
this is the last city where there's real

75
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:23,161
faggots [inaudible] leather pants and a
handlebar mustache.

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,370
Oh my God.
Are you fucking crushed too?

77
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,790
Cause it was so true on a bashed
animals.

78
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,350
Yeah.
That's fucking funny.

79
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,220
That guy that you described,
like if,

80
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,220
if,
if cock was a company that's the

81
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:44,221
chairman and CEO of cock in charge with
the fluffy socks,

82
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,420
you know the style.
Yeah.

83
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,550
Scrunched down and the timberlands like
open.

84
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,940
And then he's got cutoff Jean shorts and
a Jean Jacket.

85
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,360
He's so gay.
Sleeveless,

86
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,100
San Francisco.
This was this one,

87
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,620
Santa Monica.
Santa Monica.

88
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,090
Yeah.
This one,

89
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,800
the gas guy on earth.
The only one that comes close to him.

90
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,950
I was in Houston once and I wanted to
congratulate this guy the way he was

91
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,570
rocking it,
but I didn't want to offend them.

92
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,810
I let it go.
He had leg warmers on that.

93
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:24,340
We're rainbow that's already covered leg
warmers on.

94
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,640
And he had these little designer like
they looked like some odd tennis shoe

95
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,840
type thing that he was wearing,
some very trendy tennis shoe.

96
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,070
And then he had these boys gym shorts.
He's board member.

97
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:42,970
Those gym shorts used to wear your blue
with the white stripe and they were way

98
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:45,140
too small and they were way too small.
Okay.

99
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,390
And he's our frail man as it is.
And then he had a pink skin,

100
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:54,391
tight shirt and a some crazy
multicolored Bandana.

101
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,890
And as he was working out,
he's working out like this.

102
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,620
Ah,
AH,

103
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,240
like grunting
legwarmers man,

104
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,710
man that's ever walked the face of the
earth.

105
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,560
This guy,
if he got together with the other guy,

106
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,090
they would create a black hole.
Homosexuality.

107
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,560
Yeah.
It would eat its way through the cement.

108
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,850
Eat Cement,
spit,

109
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:24,350
come back at you.
It would be a sinkhole of gay.

110
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,360
If he slipped and fell into it.
You'd fall,

111
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,580
fall prey to the game.
You saw something.

112
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,860
She lives in San Francisco that you
definitely saw.

113
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,160
The is thing that you can see during
the,

114
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,220
you said during the parade one time you
saw a guy fucking on the corner on the

115
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,180
street,
just on the street.

116
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,060
I mean saying guys,
if you see guys but fucking on the

117
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:50,691
street,
you'd be like,

118
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:53,300
that's the gay straight up.
You'll never forget that street at that

119
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,910
moment.
It's one of the gas streets on her.

120
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:57,380
A short,
I think it was during the Folsom street

121
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:00,200
fair
game.

122
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,910
Mardi gras.
That's when I fucked on the street.

123
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,410
I like to limit it to fairs.
Bring your kids if you're willing to

124
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:09,020
fuck on the street during a fair,
you're a real gangster.

125
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,220
Like you're out there just fucking,
you're a part of the problem.

126
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,640
The Bear Jim in our old neighborhood,
some guys,

127
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,490
so this thing
is they,

128
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,650
these big guys,
they also like to build their Musk.

129
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,780
Yes.
And that's another part of it.

130
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,270
And Tommy,
one time I would think you were downwind

131
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:32,030
of a guy.
The fan was behind him or something.

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,190
Fuck man.
And you could smell his was like,

133
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,520
it was so strong.
It wasn't like Jim smells strong.

134
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,450
It was like a personal body odor that
you know,

135
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:43,340
you can just tell when someone's bos
kicking,

136
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,230
kicking because he was dirty.
Washed it.

137
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,140
Yeah,
it was.

138
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,280
It was a definitely a,
I haven't showered in like in a while.

139
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,910
Maybe it's to ward off the smell of shit
while you're fucking,

140
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,300
you ever think about that?
I mean there's gotta be something in

141
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,430
such a pride.
He had such pride about his Musk.

142
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,490
I could just tell like the way he was
like you picking up what I'm putting out

143
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:09,060
there right now.
You look about them,

144
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,830
but
I imagine that some people were walking

145
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,030
through the gym that day.
Like,

146
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,730
thanks brother.
Thanks for putting this out here because

147
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,730
you got me fired up to get me ready to
do some squats.

148
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,320
Yeah,
there's different levels of like gay

149
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:28,850
guys to write,
but what they're into,

150
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:33,850
like some guys are just into other like
crazy big gay guys and some guys they're

151
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:36,320
like twinks,
they're like little tiny little bowl.

152
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,260
Yeah.
There was this dude that I shave it down

153
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:42,800
brother,
but I knew that was a producer type

154
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:46,450
character.
So wealthy character always had like

155
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,060
these young boys with him.
They were always like just 20 years old.

156
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,540
A little confused.
Like that's,

157
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,980
you know,
a well known comic or like one.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,340
Why do you only know why?
Yeah,

159
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:57,690
that's true.
I know several,

160
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:59,090
yeah,
that's sort of a,

161
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,110
that's kind of a type
we'll otters,

162
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,010
what's an honor?
It's a tall,

163
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:12,030
slender.
Hairless is an auditor as opposed to a

164
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,610
big hairy fat,
which is a bear.

165
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,730
And a younger bear is actually a cub
bears go with cubs and cubs are just

166
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:26,181
smaller and more.
Now I heard that the word Twinkies

167
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,870
coming taboo toy,
that bag is kind of not cool to say.

168
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:34,800
I think twink is starting to become,
everybody's fired up about,

169
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,100
well here's what happened.
So you know,

170
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:45,120
Andy Cohen on Bravo,
I think he went on some other show and

171
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:46,950
he's like,
oh look at all these twinks here.

172
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,580
And then the twin community got really
upset and started doing it.

173
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,740
And so he apologized.

174
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,960
He apologized to the twinks.
Everybody is looking for an opportunity

175
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:03,870
to be sensitive.
We are in such a weird time.

176
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,920
It is,
it's like people have found reward in

177
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:10,570
like pointing at like hot button,
things like that.

178
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,221
Like,
Hey,

179
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:13,130
you know,
at the twin community we do not,

180
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,120
you know,
who else is fucking super annoying and

181
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,940
like this,
I mean this one's way different level of

182
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:28,941
like how fucking what assholes they are.
Is this like 1 million moms?

183
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,620
It's just like we're mothers that are
Christian that want to raise the fucking

184
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,090
like great kids and like,
but we're complete politically bigoted,

185
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,800
uh,
discriminatory assholes.

186
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,480
They publicly lash out for the,
this is like the second or third time at

187
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:49,440
JC Penny for having Ellen to generous
after spokesman.

188
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,480
They're like,
you realize that none of us are ever

189
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:55,560
going to shop there again because you
hired Ellen to be like that kind of

190
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:55,920
shit.

191
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,020
Like,
and they got really mad about her latest

192
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,240
Christmas commercial with Elvis and
they're like,

193
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:02,550
you have a fucking a gay woman with
Elvis.

194
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,230
What's gonna fucking happen next?
Like,

195
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,840
hey,
that's a good point.

196
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,091
I mean,
what?

197
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:10,150
What happened?
What will happen next?

198
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,670
Ins and Ian's mixing up with magical
creatures.

199
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,530
That's shit.
Shit crazy.

200
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:19,990
Definitely develop some ways.
They have nefarious intention,

201
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:23,600
so they developed some sort of lesbian
pixie dust sprayed over a city when

202
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:26,240
they're flying around and your kids,
because

203
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,630
we've got a bunch of miniature gay elves
running around.

204
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,330
Listen man,
you mock

205
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,490
the lesbian community have these genres.
I don't know.

206
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,700
I don't know.
Yeah.

207
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,930
They have lipstick,
lesbian,

208
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,580
Fred Flinstone looking lesbian lipsticks
to,

209
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,410
that's right.
Yeah.

210
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,640
The lipsticks is
100% yet the other ones are,

211
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,500
especially if they want to fight,
but not always good at shows either.

212
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,910
Didn't want to argue with best.
It's like humor can be cool for me.

213
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,970
They can be cool.
They can be cool.

214
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,310
It's like you can't really generalize a
whole fucking sexual orientation is,

215
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,340
yeah.
I've met a lot of cool lesbians,

216
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,730
straight people to
God dammit.

217
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,770
That's true.
That's sort of the anti positive

218
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,350
approach.
Everybody's got their own special gift.

219
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,550
Everybody sucks their own way
to the dark place trail.

220
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,350
That's hilarious.
And so true.

221
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:26,980
Okay.
