1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,040
What's the correct pronunciation of your
last name?

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:02,970
Dimmers.
Dimmers,

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,900
dimmers,
dimmers.

4
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:04,734
Works.

5
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,510
Ie.
Yes.

6
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:09,290
Yes.

7
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,470
And we're like second podcast of 2016.
Phil,

8
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,180
how you feel about that?
I'm ecstatic.

9
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,014
Joy,
I can't even begin to thank you for 

10
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:17,030
this.
Honestly,

11
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:17,864
if it wasn't for my having been on this 
podcast two years ago and returning now 

12
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,430
in a very timely manner,
I think I'd be a fish out of water.

13
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,960
What do you mean?
Well,

14
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:27,794
in terms of the cars that I sort of 
represent and all the multiple lawsuits 

15
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:32,390
that are levied against,
uh,

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,690
all the animal activists that you know,
that I'm amongst.

17
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,540
But let's explain to everybody who is 
unfamiliar.

18
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,230
You,
uh,

19
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,190
had a lawsuit with a marine world used 
to work for marine world marine.

20
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:46,190
Larry Marine land skews me,
which is like seaworld for Canada,

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,430
something like that type of thing.
A type of seaworld.

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,090
Seaworld is a day at the spa for animals
compared to marine land.

23
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:53,930
But yeah,
really?

24
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,850
Oh yeah,
it's that much worse.

25
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,560
Significantly worse.
So you worked for them.

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,760
Um,
you were released from your job fired as

27
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:07,520
it were.
I quit voluntarily.

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,250
I quit amidst a.
They say you're fired.

29
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,330
No,
no,

30
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,170
no.
Everybody admits her.

31
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:13,820
Quit.
I never gave him the opportunity to fire

32
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:15,890
me.
I made there were going to,

33
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,250
I think that that's the inclination I 
had at the time.

34
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,203
But you were a trainer and you,
I think you opened up a lot of people's 

35
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:23,710
eyes to it.
Um,

36
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,010
this was,
this was actually pre blackfish,

37
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,610
right?
This was pre blackfish.

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,000
You came on.
I,

39
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,390
I,
I ate pot candy and uh,

40
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,533
was in Hawaii once,
like many years ago and I hadn't 

41
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:41,160
experienced with dolphins were uh,
uh,

42
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,610
these dolphins were,
we were fishing in.

43
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:44,444
These dolphins were coming by the boat 
and they were jumping and playing with 

44
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:51,281
us and I remember thinking like this or 
they might as well be people,

45
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:53,420
they might as well be like water people 
or something.

46
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,230
These are,
there's something weird about this,

47
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,890
like they're,
they're enjoying playing with us.

48
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,410
Like as we yell to them,
they do more stuff.

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,160
Like they came by and they were jumping 
and they were clearly looking at us when

50
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:04,994
they jumped to the water and I'd never 
went to seaworld before because I had 

51
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:10,424
seen some documentaries on dolphins and 
I knew they were really smart and had 

52
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:13,694
seen some documentaries and orcas as 
well and it just always seemed really 

53
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:19,160
fucked up to me that they make them stay
in these swimming pools.

54
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,580
But when you came on the podcast two 
years ago and illuminated what it's like

55
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:27,020
behind the scenes,
at least that marine land,

56
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,243
it was horrific.
Man and I got a lot of tweets from 

57
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:31,920
people,
um,

58
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,813
and facebook messages that said they 
would never go to seaworld or marine 

59
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:36,524
land again.
And then they realized really what it 

60
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:38,330
was.

61
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,163
Then the documentary blackfish came out 
and the whole world was sort of forced 

62
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:49,781
to take a look at this and understand 
that these animals are super intelligent

63
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:50,923
just because they can't manipulate 
things just because they can't pick 

64
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:55,040
things up and they can't write their 
name.

65
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,203
They can't send you an email in their 
environment that's unnecessary and 

66
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,750
environment.
They're in the natural world.

67
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,540
They're moving through three d space and
the water,

68
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,403
they have free food and fish.
They have a huge community of fellow 

69
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,114
orcas and fellow dolphins and they 
communicate with each other through a 

70
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,370
very complex language that we barely 
understand.

71
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,220
They have a fucking language,
not like,

72
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,880
like monkeys go,
Ooh,

73
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,020
and the other monkey goes like kind of a
language.

74
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,660
Now they have a complex language with 
dialects.

75
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,010
They might as well be water

76
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,913
people.
They've already evolved to be the top 

77
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,124
Predator of the sea,
so there's no need for them to learn to 

78
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,390
email.
They have no use for it,

79
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,224
so they've all their already the the 
absolute top predators of the sea and 

80
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,670
that's a way to look at it,
right?

81
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,770
Like we have this kind of view of

82
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,880
our position being the top.
Let mean we're kind of the top Predator,

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,953
but we're only the top Predator because 
of our minds because we figured out how 

84
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:53,840
to manipulate things.
They have huge minds,

85
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:56,420
they have incredible brains,
and then they're also.

86
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,080
They eat everything they want.
They don't need to evolve any further.

87
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,640
They've sort of mastered there

88
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,930
and they're amazingly adaptable.
They evolve in every which capacity to,

89
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:08,230
um,
to be able to,

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,113
to,
to adjust to the ever changing world 

91
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,410
killer whales now,
uh,

92
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,373
I recently watched the documentary and a
on account of the melting ice in the 

93
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:19,970
Arctic in the summer.
There's,

94
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,560
there's,
you know,

95
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,750
the,
the ice floes are receding,

96
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:23,250
they're becoming smaller and smaller 
every year.

97
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,383
So now orchids are now going into 
territories that they'd never had 

98
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:26,994
before.
And you're in nun have documented that 

99
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,960
they've seen orcas actually hunt bowl 
whales,

100
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:34,110
which are 50 ton larger than an ORC 
itself.

101
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,620
And what they do is they isolate the 
animal.

102
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,150
They bite their,
uh,

103
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,080
their,
their fins,

104
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,990
they hold them underwater while another 
oracle goes on top of their blow hole to

105
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,771
try to drown it.
I mean,

106
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:45,300
this is amazing.
Adapting.

107
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,170
Wow.
Yeah.

108
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,540
Jesus Christ.
Well,

109
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:51,080
that's where they got their name killer 
whales from killing whales.

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,710
Yeah,
exactly.

111
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,543
A lot of people think they're a type of 
will there actually a cousin to a 

112
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,394
dolphin.

113
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,570
That's right.
There are dolphins.

114
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,490
They're just the largest dolphin and the
Dolphin family,

115
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,930
they just,
they eat dolphins too,

116
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:02,630
which is kind of fucked up.
Killer whales,

117
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,570
humans eat monkeys unbenounced to most 
killer whales are and you have to,

118
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,853
you have to sort of disassociate things.
You have to sort of draw a line between 

119
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:14,804
killer whales being cute and loving and 
just how you want to use the word 

120
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:18,291
statistic.
They are,

121
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,240
they are evil,
evil,

122
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,300
evil in the way that they hunt and kill.
They are merciless,

123
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,890
you know,
well we have this idea of earth,

124
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,020
you know,

125
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,853
I'm like,
the smart things are supposed to be 

126
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,534
compassionate and we're supposed to be 
the stewards of the land and take care 

127
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:37,120
of the little chipmunks and all the 
other animals.

128
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,380
But because we're so far ahead of all 
the other animals that we kinda.

129
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,940
That's how,
that's,

130
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,803
you know,
we kind of feel bad the way we treat 

131
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,444
each other.
We want to kind of treat other animals 

132
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,150
that way,
which is why,

133
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,433
you know,
animal rights organizations and all 

134
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:52,600
these,
these,

135
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,170
these people that really,
really love and care about animals.

136
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,840
That's where they sort come under fire 
because they,

137
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,220
they want people to treat animals 
different than animals.

138
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,054
Treat animals.
Animals are fucking mean shit to each 

139
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,740
other.
And that's just the way of the world.

140
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,653
One of the videos that stood out for me,
and actually it was like a sort of a 

141
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:14,200
wake up call for me was just how was,
how nasty nature is,

142
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,034
and it was a video that you actually 
shared and it was of a bear taking down 

143
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,420
a deer yard.

144
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,380
Yeah,
that guy's back.

145
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,010
Yeah.
I mean that's tough to watch,

146
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,420
right?
It is.

147
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,230
It was screaming.
The deer was screaming.

148
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,670
The bear was just eating it like 
ferociously.

149
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,623
Well,
that's the thing about bears as opposed 

150
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,080
to cats.
When a cat gets a deer,

151
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,063
they go right for the neck and they kill
it pretty quick because that's all they 

152
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,870
do.
But bears do a lot of thing.

153
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,880
They eat berries and roots and plants,
so they don't always kill things.

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,590
That matter of fact,
they probably eat more plant matter then

155
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,570
they do animal matter.
So when they kill things,

156
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,630
they basically just hold these things 
down and start eating.

157
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,120
It's a question of opportunity,
I guess,

158
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:58,090
if it arises.
Well,

159
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,053
eat a lot of funds.
That's a big issue in Canada where 

160
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,780
you're from,
sir.

161
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,060
That's right.
They eat a lot of moose,

162
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,850
moose calves and a deer fonds they eat 
them like as they're coming out,

163
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:13,720
they actually smell the placenta and 
like the,

164
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,601
the,
you know,

165
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,434
the,
all the stuff that surrounds the baby 

166
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,223
and they'll find these moose as they're 
giving birth and just literally pull 

167
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,800
them right out of their body fucked up.

168
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,010
You know,
I'm an animal rights activist by a,

169
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,080
I suppose that's the label that I've 
been given,

170
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,670
but I should mention that,
uh,

171
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,683
there are a lot of animal rights 
activists that owe you a great deal of 

172
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,360
credit for,
uh,

173
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,920
for your sort of,
your,

174
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,210
I want to use your sort of advocacy 
despite the fact that there are,

175
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,823
there's a stark line between those who 
believe in not killing animals and 

176
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:51,084
everything else.
But then there are also other people 

177
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,034
that can appreciate how nature operates.
Predator prey relationship and can also 

178
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,470
appreciate that,
you know,

179
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,980
at least in what you've,
what you've said before,

180
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,730
you yourself are opposed to the 
captivity of animals.

181
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:06,960
I mean,
the last time we were on,

182
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:07,794
you've mentioned of going to a zoo and 
maybe eating a cookie and having a look 

183
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:12,120
at the monkeys and being like,
you know,

184
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,310
you're throwing bose through animals 
and,

185
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,333
and I very much respect the fact that 
the way that you hunt in the way that 

186
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:18,534
you eat is a kill what you eat,
movement or whatever you want to call 

187
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:22,224
it.
And as an animal rights activist I can 

188
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,770
say that that is a far more responsible 
way than,

189
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,633
you know,
want to take a look at the factory 

190
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:28,620
farming things and whatnot.
But,

191
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,470
um,
uh,

192
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,141
I forget.
Shit,

193
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:32,550
I forgot the point I was making.
Yeah,

194
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,120
I know what you're saying.
That it's sort of almost would seem like

195
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:38,960
I'd be a against them in some sort of a 
way because I eat meat.

196
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,160
But the reality is a lot of animal 
rights activists have fucking cats,

197
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:45,320
man.
And they feed their cats cat food.

198
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,213
And guess what?
That shit ain't grown on a cat food 

199
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:48,770
tree.
You know,

200
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,080
there's,
there's a reality to the world.

201
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,290
And cats are brutal.
Cats are vicious little fuckers and they

202
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,580
need protein and if you have a cat and I
have two of them,

203
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,690
I love them.
They're awesome.

204
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,700
They come cuddle with me and while I'm 
watching TV

205
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,080
on any given day,
I've got five cats,

206
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,113
three that I claim as my own too,
that just sort of come and go at will 

207
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,910
wildcats.
Uh,

208
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,880
well.
One is one of the neighbors sort of,

209
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,070
I would say that he's sort of neglected 
it.

210
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:13,560
And in terms of how you care for a 
domestic cat.

211
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,180
Um,
and when he moved away he said,

212
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:15,961
look,
you know,

213
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:17,580
you,
you take care of this cat,

214
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,350
which I did.
I'm on my second level balcony.

215
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,060
I built this thing,
I call it the Taj mckinney.

216
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,120
It was this place where the cat could 
come live in the winter.

217
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:24,954
Right?
And it's real cold.

218
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,520
And uh,
so he said,

219
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:27,630
you know,
do you want to keep this cat?

220
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,593
So I got it fixed and whatnot.
And he likes to show his gratitude by 

221
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,860
bringing us a baby rabbits.
If you've ever seen a baby rabbit,

222
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:35,694
the cutest thing in the world.
And he maliciously licks them down to 

223
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,980
the point of just chewing them until the
sound stops and leaving them as gifts.

224
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:49,200
And you can't help but love Eugene.
Eugene is the is amazing and loving cat.

225
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,410
He's also a just a cold blooded killer.

226
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,603
That's why they're alive.
We don't want to think about it that 

227
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:57,084
way.
But animals today that are alive today 

228
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,730
in 2016 are alive because their 
ancestors,

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,180
especially predators,
like cats were fucking vicious.

230
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,043
They were vicious and ruthless and they 
made sure they killed everything they 

231
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:12,150
could because if you don't kill that 
little baby rabbit,

232
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,830
the there might not be anything left for
you to eat that day and you might starve

233
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,070
or you might be too weak to get away 
from something that wants to kill you.

234
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,933
Exactly.
He might be too weak to get away from a 

235
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,220
bowl for you might be,
you know,

236
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,530
it's,
we,

237
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,360
we have a beautiful situation.
We'd go to the store,

238
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,740
we buy food that someone else killed for
us and we can get it every time.

239
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,753
It's not like a rare thing like you have
to wait for it if you have to put in a 

240
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,950
lot of effort to get it throughout human
history.

241
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,580
It's always been difficult to acquire 
food until recently.

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,833
Recently it's become so ridiculous.
You don't even have to get out of your 

243
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:46,884
fucking car to eat.
You literally pull into a fucking drive 

244
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:50,964
thru you hand these people paper within 
seconds they hand you already cooked 

245
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,430
meat in a sandwich,
a ground beef sandwich.

246
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,563
You put it on your seat,
they give you a glass of liquid sweet 

247
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:04,944
shit.
He's stick that in your Little Cup 

248
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:08,490
holder and you're eating.
That's insane.

249
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,623
Never before in human history is that 
happened and that lack of effort and 

250
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:13,854
lack of connection has bred a lot of 
people that have a really distorted 

251
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,174
understanding of life itself.
Love really distorted understanding of 

252
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:25,050
what it takes to make a ground beef 
sandwich.

253
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,273
You know,
if you want to raise a cow yourself and 

254
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:31,680
go through that whole thing.
I have a few friends that do it.

255
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:35,400
I have my good friend Doug in Wisconsin.
He grows his own cows.

256
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,170
They're all grass fed and he,
he'll,

257
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,850
you know,
he gave me some,

258
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,630
some meat from it last time I was there 
and he does it all himself.

259
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,360
He shoots him himself.
I mean he does the whole deed.

260
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,340
He butchers them,
he hangs them,

261
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,473
the whole deed and that guy understands 
what it takes to make a ground beef 

262
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,703
sandwich,
but most of us is pulling to that drive 

263
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:55,510
through.

264
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,343
I think it's a privileged perspective.
It's people that have never had to do 

265
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,060
anything like that.
Yeah.

266
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,980
Put any effort in raising their food.
I have friends that are farmers and it's

267
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,140
the same story and they love and respect
their animals through and through,

268
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:05,974
but at the end of the day,
they.

269
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,230
It becomes a steak.
It sounds like a contradiction,

270
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,270
right?
You know,

271
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,100
loving your animal,
put killing it.

272
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,083
I think in defense of anyone that likes 
to call out hypocrisy is that you have 

273
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:17,134
to take a look at the fact that there's 
hypocrisy in absolutely everything you 

274
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,170
do.
I mean the fact that loan that.

275
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,670
And I'm going to use vegans as an 
example,

276
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,060
if you,
if you're going to look at what,

277
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,423
what an abomination of nature is really 
the functions of society as a whole 

278
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,653
city,
a city of physical city is an 

279
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,960
abomination of nature.
Yeah.

280
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,140
So if you're a Vegan and you're,
for instance,

281
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,390
renting an apartment and driving a car 
immediately,

282
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,224
there's hypocrisy in that.
And then this is not me calling out at 

283
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,640
the idea of living a compassionate life 
or propagating that.

284
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:43,790
I think that's fine.
I think it's great.

285
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,880
I encourage that.
I think the world needs more compassion,

286
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,310
but uh,
it's the judgment,

287
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,450
right?
It's the judgment.

288
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,310
I think,
uh,

289
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,143
when you,
when you start looking from the 

290
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:54,850
perspective of someone who's privileged,
then yeah,

291
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,130
the judgment.

292
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,450
But I mean,
the judgment comes.

293
00:12:57,451 --> 00:13:00,270
I think a lot of it comes from a real 
place where people are like,

294
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:02,790
fuck this factory farming shit.
Fuck.

295
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,810
People who eat meat,
you know,

296
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:04,740
they get,
they get angry,

297
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:05,880
you know,
they love animals,

298
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,223
but it's so hilarious when you have a 
cat that's feasting on a multitude of 

299
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:15,120
animals that have been raised in 
captivity.

300
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:17,250
All of them being the way they raise 
animals.

301
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:18,120
When you you're buying

302
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,890
food,
man,

303
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:20,724
you're buying like

304
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,603
the worst treated animals ever.
I've never even heard of like ethically 

305
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:27,890
source cat food.
I'm sure it exists.

306
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,310
I'm sure I haven't heard about it.
But even as it'd be sourced cat food,

307
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,383
whatever,
man,

308
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,233
it's murder.
If you feed your cats plants and there 

309
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:37,610
are people who do that.
They have organ failure.

310
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,980
They fucking get heart attacks.
They die,

311
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,140
they can't live.
But there's a lot of people.

312
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:42,974
There's a whole.
I found these people because I found 

313
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:48,440
these people because they're hating on 
me after my last,

314
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:51,200
a comedy central special where I did 
this bit about vegans.

315
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,220
So,
uh,

316
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,053
whenever people get really mad at me,
I like to go to their twitter page and 

317
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:55,844
read what they're into.
It's like he's fucking people's twitter 

318
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:02,270
page and I found out that there's a 
whole Vegan cat forum,

319
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,580
Vegan cat owners and you know,
Hashtag cruelty free and these fuckers,

320
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,713
they,
they feed their cats plants and they 

321
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:12,500
don't live long.
They die.

322
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,870
I'd like to have a conversation with 
those cats.

323
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:16,310
I mean,
it would be nice if we could bridge that

324
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:17,570
language barrier.
Oh yeah.

325
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:19,130
If you rolled a mouse by one of those 
cats,

326
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:21,620
they would dive on it like a,
like a dress,

327
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,680
like a man in the ocean that just 
finally got to land.

328
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,953
Yeah.
Like if you just barely made it this 

329
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,063
door,
that feeling that you get when you get 

330
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:34,700
to land.
Oh,

331
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,551
I think there's,
there's,

332
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:36,800
there's a line,
there's a line in,

333
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,390
in all advocacy where how far are you 
willing to go?

334
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:40,224
And it's a question of it really.
It's a question of how willing are you 

335
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,373
to sacrifice.
I lived in South Korea for awhile and 

336
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:48,000
this is a country that was leveled back 
in the mid fifties.

337
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:50,220
They had to rebuild from essentially 
nothing.

338
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,740
And so I saw a,
I mean I saw a pig heads being served up

339
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:55,574
on the side of roads,
but I can appreciate that these people 

340
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:57,764
had suffered so much so that they had to
eat everything that was available to 

341
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:02,060
them and I don't want to sit here and 
defend that,

342
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,021
you know?
Okay.

343
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,760
So South Koreans are eating dogs and 
whatnot.

344
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,210
And you know,
it's,

345
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,670
it's symbolic of their history and 
whatnot,

346
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,000
but if you've got nothing left to eat,
I'd like to see how quickly your,

347
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,800
uh,
your ethics change,

348
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,820
right?
Because truly,

349
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:14,960
if you are truly suffering

350
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,110
and a dog,
I love dogs.

351
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:20,810
I have two dogs,
but let's be honest about what a dog is.

352
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,883
A dog is a little captive pet.
They're your buddies because you feed 

353
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,830
them and you take care of them and you 
have this relationship with them and you

354
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:30,770
have this agreement with them.
But if you ran into a wild dog,

355
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,753
there was a couple,
an elderly couple I want to say like 

356
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,413
maybe seven or eight years ago that was 
killed by a pack of wild dogs in 

357
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,410
Georgia,
Georgia,

358
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:42,320
United States Atlanta.
Know that area.

359
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,150
Of course,
like what the fuck man?

360
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,540
Like dogs will fucking kill you if they 
don't have any food.

361
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,643
If you,
if you think that they are like old 

362
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:54,710
yeller or lassie or some know what they 
are,

363
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,050
is exactly how you treat them from 
birth.

364
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,490
If you get a puppy like my dog johnny,
I have a dog named Johnny cash.

365
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,120
He's the sweetest dog of all time.
He is so nice.

366
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,890
He's just so gentle.
He's just,

367
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,140
he's a mastiff and he's just so 
friendly.

368
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,153
He just like anybody that comes over.
I never worried about him barking at 

369
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:13,880
them or if he barks,
it's like,

370
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:14,930
hey man,
come play with me,

371
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,520
you know,
and when you go up to and be like,

372
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,354
what's up dude?
And he's always like super happy and 

373
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:19,874
super sweet,
but it's because I've had them from the 

374
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,540
time he was a baby.
And the guy who bred him,

375
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,950
um,
he,

376
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,813
he's always been like really ethical 
about how he breeds these dogs and 

377
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:30,674
they're very smart and kind.
But it's because of the relationship 

378
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:35,660
that I had with him.
He knows I'm the Daddy.

379
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,250
I give him the food.
I give them the love,

380
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,810
you know,
it's all this,

381
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,610
this agreement as part of the 
revolution.

382
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:40,970
I mean,
there

383
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,803
they're physically cute on account of 
the fact that we selectively bred them 

384
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,740
through and they themselves learned 
that,

385
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,690
hey,
if I'm like really Das island cute,

386
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,630
look what these big puppy dogs,
I get more food and I get a better place

387
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:51,464
to live and get more of a warm,
a warm or shelter and I'm not likely to 

388
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:54,950
wind up in the backyard and winter,
you know?

389
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,960
Well,
there was actually a radio lab podcast.

390
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:02,961
It was absolutely fascinating on raising
foxes and they raised foxes.

391
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,090
Yeah.
You say Fox is right.

392
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,940
It's not like dear.
I think so,

393
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,300
right?
I'm not going to correct you.

394
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,860
I'm goofy.
Seems like fishes foxes.

395
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,710
Fishes isn't acceptable word

396
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,591
if I'm not mistaken.
Yeah.

397
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:19,000
But you can use the word fishes.
Really.

398
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:19,834
I thought there was a large debate about
this and this was figured out back in 

399
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:23,090
the mid nineties.
I started this as part of my.

400
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,220
You might be right.
I don't know.

401
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,300
Um,
but anyway,

402
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:27,134
the radio lab about foxes,
they selectively bred fox is based on 

403
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:31,274
their behavior based on whether or not 
they were aggressive in the ones that 

404
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:34,964
were aggressive.
They killed and the ones that reacted a 

405
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:37,094
certain way,
I don't remember the actual parameters 

406
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:41,780
that they set,
but ultimately what it was,

407
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:45,260
and if you're into this google it 
because I don't remember the name of the

408
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,700
episode,
but it was amazing.

409
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,390
Within a few generations,
like within less than 10 years,

410
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,253
they had completely changed with these 
foxes looked like their ears had become 

411
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:57,744
droopy.
Their jaws would become less pronounced 

412
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:03,060
and smaller.
Their behavior was markedly different.

413
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,013
They were literally were almost a 
different species and it was within 10 

414
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,214
years.
Things adapt and change and that's the 

415
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,320
reverse to that is,
and I think I heard on your podcast,

416
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:14,154
is that if you were to release a wild or
rather a pig and then it eventually 

417
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,760
starts growing hair again and like maybe
protruding some tests because I'm out of

418
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,120
six weeks.

419
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,950
Yeah.
Within six weeks,

420
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,883
a fucking month of a pig living in the 
wild and all of a sudden their hair 

421
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:29,850
starts growing thicker and longer.
Their nose extends,

422
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,480
their tusks grow larger.
They become a different thing.

423
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,820
They literally start to.
They start to adapt to the,

424
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,763
the,
the,

425
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,310
the,
the physical shape of wild pig like,

426
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:44,380
have you ever been around wild pigs 
here?

427
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,590
So not,
it's really interesting.

428
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,340
First of all,
they're all,

429
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,810
there are,
a lot of them are black.

430
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,180
They're like a dark,
dark color.

431
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,130
And I'm not even talking about boards 
I'm talking about,

432
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:53,590
right.
Well,

433
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,400
we think of bore.
What is a board is actually the term for

434
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,680
a male pig.
Okay.

435
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,793
So when you see,
when people go to a menu and it says 

436
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,360
wild boar sausage,
is it really?

437
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,950
How do you know?
It's not a wild girl,

438
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,380
you know,
it might be a sow like the word,

439
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,900
but it's a,
it's an ignorant terminology.

440
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,153
But then there's these Russian bores is 
a different type of bore that lives in 

441
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:18,660
other countries.
I don't know exactly what the genius is,

442
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:19,494
what the name is,
but the crazy thing is they're all 

443
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:21,894
interchangeable.
There are other can all breed with each 

444
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,710
other.
They're all the same thing.

445
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,740
Ultimately there's dodgy crossbred all 
the time to sort of like pull out the,

446
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:32,100
uh,
uh,

447
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,620
the,
the,

448
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,000
the advantages that we're looking for 
when we're breeding them so you can make

449
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:36,834
a,
I know they were breeding I and I don't 

450
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,270
know,
I can't remember where now,

451
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:40,104
but uh,
they were selectively breeding this 

452
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:42,024
hunter have a dog and they just made 
this mammoth machine but also a 

453
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,240
domicile,
domicile and trusted creature.

454
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:49,920
So I wish,
I wish I remembered where I,

455
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,510
where I read that.
Yeah,

456
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:52,290
there,
um,

457
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,123
I mean it's,
it's amazing that dogs are a lot like 

458
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:59,040
people in that way that there's a lot of
different variations of people.

459
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,933
No,
I mean you've got Shaquille o'neal and 

460
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:05,780
then you've got a Natasha Leggiero,
right?

461
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,920
Little Tiny Natasha.
She's a comedian.

462
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,770
She's a 100 pounds,
but as you know,

463
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,670
there's people very almost as much as 
dogs do in that sense.

464
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,340
You know,
we're,

465
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,810
we're all sorts of different shapes and 
looks and.

466
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,410
But my point being wild animals,
like a feral cat.

467
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:23,244
I've had feral cats before.
I had a feral cat and he was fucking 

468
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,750
nuts.
Did you actually get near him?

469
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,320
I could only me,
like literally only me,

470
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,260
no one else could get near and he would 
hiss and fucking run away.

471
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:38,400
He would hiss at me half the time,
but if I approached them real slow,

472
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,770
but once I picked him up,
oh my God,

473
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:41,604
he would start preparing like crazy in 
fact alone that you got close enough to 

474
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:46,230
be able to pick them up as a pretty 
rare.

475
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,333
Well,
what I did was I tamed him and it was a 

476
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:50,260
weird way.
My friend Lanie,

477
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,850
um,
her boyfriend and her,

478
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,010
uh,
lived in this apartment and they had,

479
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,923
um,
down below I went to high school with 

480
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:57,244
her and down below their apartment they 
found a cat that had given birth to a 

481
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:04,630
litter of wild.
And this is like Santa Monica.

482
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,430
So they're like,
oh my God,

483
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,264
what are we going to do?
So they decided to capture these cats 

484
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,740
and try to get them home.
So me and like the asshole that I am.

485
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:12,131
I said,
all right,

486
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:13,810
I'll take it.
So I took one of them.

487
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,140
I brought them home and he was.
So I thought,

488
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,340
oh,
he's a kitten.

489
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,080
I'll bring them home and hang out with 
my cat.

490
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:20,914
Everything will be cool.
And I had two cats at the time and he 

491
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:27,460
was so fucking different than them.

492
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,600
He was like,
he'd look at you just fucking jump up.

493
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:33,760
Five,
six features mentally different.

494
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,920
Oh my God.
He was so scared of everything.

495
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:36,970
He was terrified.
It was.

496
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:39,790
Everything was a legitimate life or 
death struggle.

497
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,020
So,
uh,

498
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:42,880
I did.
The Internet wasn't around back then,

499
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,440
so I was trying to figure out like,
okay,

500
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:47,410
how the fuck do I do this?
I got to get to know this little dude.

501
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,820
So yeah,
I food and what it did was I uh,

502
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,240
took this room in my house.
I put a bed in there.

503
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:57,430
It's like a guest room.
Sir had bad in there.

504
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,650
But uh,
I decided it's going to be my room now.

505
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,020
So a close myself in there,
put a litter box in there.

506
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,460
I brought some books and hung out with 
his fucking cat for two days.

507
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:07,150
You're brave,
dude,

508
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,370
man.
This cat,

509
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:09,850
I think cat attack humans.

510
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,860
And it's a violent man.
He was a kitten.

511
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,630
It was a baby.
It was a baby,

512
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,250
I would have never done this with full 
blown can.

513
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,980
You can,
you can't.

514
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,220
Full blown cat.
You just can't.

515
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,350
You can't train them.
He was only,

516
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,750
he was a little tiny thing.
So what I did was,

517
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:23,584
uh,
I would,

518
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,723
I would pet him and he per like crazy 
and then when I put him down he will 

519
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:28,184
hiss at me and run away.
Like he was so fucked up and I mean he 

520
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:33,190
would jump.
He would say he fucked up my curtains,

521
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,263
jumped through the air and grabbed the 
curtains and was like trying to climb 

522
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,270
them and shit.
It was like out of control.

523
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:39,641
It's like,
dude,

524
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,680
I was just petting you a few seconds 
ago,

525
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,873
but the life or death struggle that 
these things were involved in even 

526
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,370
whatever he got from his mom and his 
dad,

527
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,383
like the genes that were passed down,
their genes have wild animals that were 

528
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,540
really scared of everything and trying 
to survive.

529
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,920
So he thought he was about to get eaten,
but it became my little buddy.

530
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,730
Yeah.
Took a while.

531
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,183
Was there an element of you that's sort 
of loved the fact that it was bad ass 

532
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:06,580
and scratching your curtains that shit 
or you're like,

533
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:07,150
no,
I hate it.

534
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,780
It was fascinating.
It was like,

535
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,743
like I'm,
I'm a big fan of just the idea of 

536
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,020
wildlife,
you know,

537
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:21,030
I think we live in cities and living in 
cities and driving cars and sleeping and

538
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:25,000
nice houses and you know,
having a yard,

539
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:28,190
it's probably as close to a lot of 
people get to nature on a daily basis.

540
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,363
They got a tree and some fucking grass 
in the yard when you're out in wild and 

541
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:37,630
you see wild nature.
One of the most fascinating things about

542
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:41,170
hunting is not just the pursuit of an 
animal that you're going to eat,

543
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,710
but it's also spending a lot of time out
there in the real wild.

544
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,500
Like the real while we're fucking elk 
lives,

545
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,703
you know,
we're a thousand pound animal lives its 

546
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:53,234
life with fucking trees growing out of 
his head and wanders through the forest 

547
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,190
and couple weeks a month out of the year
gets to fuck.

548
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,710
And the rest of the time it's just 
running from danger and eating,

549
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,260
fighting.
It's massively interesting.

550
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,320
Not the slightest clue.
Native of the modern world,

551
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,760
you know,
couldn't care less.

552
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,420
All it cares about is doing what it 
naturally does to stay alive.

553
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,620
And that's really where animals should 
be.

554
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,131
Yeah,
I mean,

555
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:17,220
that's the premise of,
uh,

556
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,203
of,
of what we're sort of dealing with that 

557
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,220
it's just so fascinating when they're 
there.

558
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,990
Um,
I encourage everybody.

559
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:25,370
I mean,
zoos are bullshit,

560
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,720
man.
They're bullshit.

561
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:29,210
They give you a stupid idea of what an 
animal is.

562
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,860
It's just a business.
They're there to make your money.

563
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,150
They're not in reintroducing animals 
into the wild there.

564
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,190
There's no program.
I mean,

565
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:35,024
I don't want to say there's nothing that
I'd like to hope that there are some 

566
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,710
programs where they help animals and 
then you know what it is.

567
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,544
It's like there's,
there's some animals that are so far 

568
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:45,350
gone and needs so much help that it 
actually,

569
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,383
it benefits them to have some of them in
captivity just so they can keep a 

570
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,390
breeding population alive.
But ultimately,

571
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,270
does that breeding population get 
reintroduced into wild in any capacity?

572
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,190
Some of them,
in some cases,

573
00:24:58,191 --> 00:24:59,024
they've done it with tigers.
I know they've done it with some 

574
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:02,450
animals.
It's hard.

575
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,590
You know,
it's fucking hard.

576
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:04,190
I mean,
I'm not.

577
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,880
I'm not sliding in any way.
People who care about wild animals.

578
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,714
I absolutely care about wild animals.
I think it's made people think you 

579
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,350
don't.
If you're a hunter,

580
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:13,760
you eat and I get it.

581
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,590
I understand.
I understand where they're coming from,

582
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,040
but this is how I try to look at it.
Those animals are going to die no matter

583
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:23,690
what.
Every they're all going to die.

584
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:24,524
They're not going to live forever.
I'm not talking about wiping out 

585
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:28,440
populations with hunting.
It's not.

586
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,010
I'm not doing that and I don't think any
hunters are trying to do that.

587
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:31,844
In fact,
what hunters are trying to do and what 

588
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:36,770
they have done,
there's more deer in North America today

589
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:40,760
than they were when Columbus landed.
And the reason is a bunch of things,

590
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,760
but a big part of it is wildlife 
management.

591
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,013
The wildlife agencies,
like department of fish and wildlife in 

592
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:49,220
in America,
department of fish and game,

593
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,640
they're.
They're very careful about how many deer

594
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:56,090
they allow people to take and there's 
consequences for poaching,

595
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:56,924
like stiff consequences.
They put you in jail and because of 

596
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:03,110
these rules and enforcing these ethics,
they've allowed these animals to grow in

597
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:05,900
massive numbers and then of course 
there's also agriculture.

598
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,733
Agriculture contributes to them a lot.
Like the most deer population or the 

599
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,760
biggest deer population in America is 
usually around people.

600
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,760
It's usually in people and farms.
Some of the biggest deer in the world,

601
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:17,594
like Iowa and Kansas,
they're known for like the biggest deer 

602
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,510
in North America.
Canada is actually known for the biggest

603
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:24,344
ones,
but that has to do with cold 

604
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:26,054
temperatures,
creating larger body to animals because 

605
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:30,830
they have to generate more heat to stay 
alive,

606
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,443
but my point is I'm not a hater of 
animals exist just because I kill them 

607
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:36,741
and eat them.
In fact,

608
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:38,390
I love them.
I really do.

609
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,770
It sounds.
I get it.

610
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,920
I know it sounds contradictory,
but what you're.

611
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:43,980
When you're eating an

612
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,610
animal is almost like a sacred thing.
When you hunt an animal and you kill and

613
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,453
you eat it,
it sounds like such a hippie horseshit 

614
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,680
or some pseudo spiritual horseshit,
but it is kind of sacred.

615
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,533
There is something that happens when I 
Cook a steak of an elk that I ate and I 

616
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:02,760
grilled that thing and I eat it.
There's A.

617
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,220
There's a connection that I have to that
meat that's.

618
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,890
It's crazy.
It's an environment of different levels.

619
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:13,070
I don't know if the word earned.
It is the correct word for it.

620
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,670
I'm connected to it.
Sure.

621
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,260
You know,
I'm connected to that animal.

622
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,060
I'm connected to where this meat comes 
from.

623
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,090
I know that that animal ate from the 
grass,

624
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,040
you know,
in the forest,

625
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,760
and then I killed it and now I'm eating 
it and this was like this weird,

626
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:30,930
crazy cycle,
but I grew up on a moose meat.

627
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,060
My Dad was a hunter,
avid hunter.

628
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,860
He went out there.
I mean a nice stock photo recently.

629
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,540
If a kid up on that microphone,
my friend,

630
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,220
so pull it towards you could pull it 
towards the back.

631
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,220
I saw a photo recently have my dad back,
it has to be in the eighties and he took

632
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:42,054
down a bull moose.
I mean this was a massive animal and 

633
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:43,900
the,
the,

634
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,980
the best of my recollection was just 
eating that animal.

635
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:50,850
So I mean even the fact alone that I'm a
meat eater and you know,

636
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,330
people rarely now back in 2012,
this is a different story,

637
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,164
but you know,
there's been a largely a paradigm shift 

638
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,340
in how we view animals,
especially captive animals,

639
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:01,680
but that was called out quite a bit for 
being a hypocrite.

640
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:02,514
Oh,
you eat meat or you got leather shoes 

641
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,240
and it says as if my message is worth 
nothing.

642
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,810
It's like,
well,

643
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,610
you're not paying attention to the,
to the core of my message,

644
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:10,444
like stop attacking the Messenger and 
that's the sort of defense I have 

645
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:15,090
against people who like to call 
hypocrisy in everything.

646
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,240
Do you eat fast food and like store 
bought food?

647
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:19,050
Yeah,
on my,

648
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,450
at my weakest moments and admittedly a 
week,

649
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,284
man,
I tried,

650
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,330
I tried not to.
And last time I was on the show,

651
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:25,141
I had stressed that,
you know,

652
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:25,974
I,
I tried to get away from pork and still 

653
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:29,190
I tried to make an ethical decision as 
possible,

654
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,960
but not at three in the morning,
you know,

655
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,130
it just,
it happens.

656
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:33,950
It was just like last night we were 
driving around with cruise around,

657
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,913
we needed to eat and we found our food 
and we gave them that paper money and I 

658
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:42,090
slept better.
So it's tricky,

659
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:43,950
right?
It's tricky trying to stay alive.

660
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,390
And the last time I was on the show,
I had actually mentioned that I was,

661
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:48,840
uh,
had a hard time getting off cheese.

662
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:51,570
And it's recent.
It's interesting because recently I read

663
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:53,210
a study that cheese may very well,
uh,

664
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,670
react to you or your mind may actually 
react to cheese.

665
00:28:55,671 --> 00:29:00,450
Similarly to crack that it was,
I wish I could quote it better again,

666
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:01,284
I'm not a scientist,
but I did read this article and it said 

667
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:04,644
that the more processed that a food is,
that it creates some type of fat that 

668
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:09,150
your brain itself becomes addicted to 
it.

669
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,520
And they actually referenced an 
addiction to crack.

670
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:13,350
And that it was similar.
Look at this.

671
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,450
Cheese really is cracks.
Jamie,

672
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:17,820
you're on the ball.
You need a raise change.

673
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,683
She's really,
it's crack steady reveals cheese is as 

674
00:29:21,331 --> 00:29:23,490
addictive as drugs.
That is fucking insane.

675
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,503
Well,
you know what that makes sense because 

676
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:27,160
it tell you what Anthony Bourdain,
um,

677
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,270
that motherfucker loves cheese and he's 
a,

678
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,780
had notorious substance abuse problems 
in the past.

679
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,940
But I've fucking hung out with him,
man.

680
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,943
The way he talks about cheese is a way 
young 22 year old guys talk about pussy 

681
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,090
now you,
it's like,

682
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,020
oh my God,
stinky cheeses.

683
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,500
Stinkiest the better.
Pull that up so I can understand that.

684
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:48,070
Jamie,
let me,

685
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,280
let me pull it.
Pull it up so the techs could read.

686
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,473
This is fucking nuts.
For years you've been telling your 

687
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,900
friends family cohort,
what is the title of this?

688
00:29:55,901 --> 00:30:00,901
That it's from the La Times food daily 
dish by Jenn Harris.

689
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,853
And uh,
it says for years you've been telling 

690
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:04,931
your friends,
family,

691
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:07,120
coworkers,
and anyone who will listen to that.

692
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:10,720
You're addicted to cheese.
It's part of every meal or snack.

693
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,733
And you think about it constantly.
A few studies suggests that food 

694
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:14,734
addiction is a real thing.
The study published by the US National 

695
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,800
Library of Medicine examines why certain
foods are more addictive than others.

696
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,903
Researchers identified addictive foods 
from about 500 people who completed in 

697
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:28,060
the Yale Food Addiction scale,
Huh?

698
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,463
Okay.
It's p achieves happens to be specially 

699
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:33,220
addicted because of an ingredient called
caisson.

700
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,293
Okay.
It's a protein found in all milk 

701
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,770
products during digestion case.
Am I saying that right?

702
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:42,760
Case in C,
a s e I n releases opiates.

703
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Whoa.
Called casomorphins.

704
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:46,834
Holy Shit.
Opiates get released when you eat 

705
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:50,944
cheese.
Really play with the dopamine receptors 

706
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:56,230
and trigger that addictive element.
Wow,

707
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,000
that's amazing.
People are gonna.

708
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:00,370
Start putting some crafts.
Synthetic cheese and syringes.

709
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:02,230
I don't know what I've been eating 
lately.

710
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,123
I've been eating raw cheese,
beginning raw cheese from the whole 

711
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:06,964
foods.
Whole foods has the raw cheese which 

712
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,540
made with raw milk.
It's fucking great.

713
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,670
It's really good.
Raw milk is great too.

714
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,320
That's the thing I've gotten away from 
the most.

715
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,810
I growing up,
I drank a lot of milk,

716
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,830
a lot of milk.

717
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,180
I would say more than the average 
person.

718
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,760
Now I can't,
I can't stomach it.

719
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,460
Burleson milk.
Yeah.

720
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,560
I just can't.
I have no urge for it whatsoever.

721
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:26,680
Now just so how do you eat cookies?
Okay.

722
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:28,270
There's the window.
Hypocrisy comes in,

723
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,120
right?
The largest hypocrite I admitted.

724
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,781
Yeah,
so you're right.

725
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:35,500
So I guess I do have,
I do have a different course.

726
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,580
I,
I,

727
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,560
and I,
I've heard on the podcast before and I'm

728
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,750
going to accept some of the judgment 
that's going to come from it,

729
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,883
but I've made the switch to almond milk 
and feel free to rant about how bad 

730
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,710
almond milk is for a,
a,

731
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:48,544
the environment a for all the almonds 
that are being wasted and the water use 

732
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:52,654
and everything else.
I mean there is a perspective that 

733
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,341
people like to say,
Oh,

734
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:55,690
almond milk,
that's a healthy alternative.

735
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:57,540
But if you look at it from the other 
side,

736
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,810
the environmental impact,
everything else,

737
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,913
almond milk shit.

738
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,260
So.
Well it's not bad.

739
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,960
It's just what almond milk.
Here's one thing that everybody needs to

740
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:07,360
consider when you buy almond milk and it
tastes good.

741
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,021
It's like,
oh,

742
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:10,750
this is so sweet.
Look at the fucking label bitches.

743
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,633
All right,
because guarantee that shit is filled 

744
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:14,380
with sugar.
Duncan called me up,

745
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,240
dude,
I've been drinking almond milk.

746
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:18,700
It's amazing.
It's so delicious.

747
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:19,350
I go,
okay,

748
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:19,870
what?
What?

749
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,703
What kind of drink?
And he tells me that I go look at the 

750
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:24,460
label and look how much sugar is in it.
He goes,

751
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,150
Holy Shit.
He's like 18 grams.

752
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,841
I'm like,
yeah,

753
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:31,800
every class is 18 grams of sugar.
All right.

754
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,900
That's a whole lot of sugar.
I think you're not supposed to have like

755
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,763
if you're trying to be healthy,
I don't believe you're supposed to have 

756
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:39,770
more than 25 grams of a day.

757
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,903
I think there's like a limit where you 
hit a limit and if you go over that 

758
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:44,061
you're like,
Whoa,

759
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:44,894
you're fucking with your body there and 
this dude's getting most of that from a 

760
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:52,010
glass of supposedly healthy almond milk.
Well,

761
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,010
I don't drink a lot of it admittedly,
but tastes the alternative.

762
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:56,030
Yeah,
I think it does taste good.

763
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,700
That's kind of nutty flavor.
It's got a nice texture.

764
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,930
What can I say?
It's,

765
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:03,140
I'm really bad when you're in a place 
like California,

766
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,410
which is normally how experiencing a 
drought today.

767
00:33:05,411 --> 00:33:08,180
It's porn like fucking crazy.
We're in the middle of the Nina.

768
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,760
I around know if you'll know theses Nino
and it's a fix.

769
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,610
Do you want to warm the water?
You'll think they do.

770
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:20,330
There's no consequences to your actions.
Danielle is ia.

771
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,070
It couldn't wait three days for me to 
go.

772
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:23,930
No,
it's good.

773
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,040
It's good.
I like it.

774
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,503
I like watching all these fucking 
dummies who have no idea how to drive 

775
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:30,860
when it rains out.
Oh,

776
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,003
that's one of the things I loved about 
when I lived in Colorado for the brief 

777
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:35,510
time when it would snow.
It's like,

778
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,160
ah,
yes.

779
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,263
I love a little consequences for living 
on earth and nature is a thing that we 

780
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:46,280
avoid in California.
We have avoided it.

781
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,440
It's doesn't.
It barely exists.

782
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,760
When we go to the ocean.
I'm like,

783
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,470
Whoa,
cool.

784
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,790
Nurture.
That's the only time you know you can go

785
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,590
visit it.
You can go to the park and visit it,

786
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,950
but it doesn't rain.
There's no.

787
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,270
Whether it's no consequences.
I feel like water probably in California

788
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,520
as some,
in a way,

789
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,463
the glue that's going to keep the ground
together because you guys are bad ass 

790
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:05,864
drought.
I've seen these before and after 

791
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:07,610
pictures and I'm like,
wow.

792
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,010
And I remember when I was repeatedly 
asking you to come back in the show,

793
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:10,844
I'd be like,
I got to get down there before 

794
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,500
California runs out of water.
We're not out a water.

795
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,890
We're right next to the fucking ocean.
They just need to figure out a suck that

796
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,810
water out of the ocean.
Get the salt out of it.

797
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:21,644
It's it.
Look what if we could put people on the 

798
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,044
moon,
how the hell can we not get salt out of 

799
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:29,480
the fucking water?
It's to just stop making smaller phones.

800
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,860
Stop adding new TV channels to DIRECTV.
Figure it out.

801
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:34,694
You fucks.
Just get in there and suck that water 

802
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:38,410
out and let's turn this bitch knew a 
rain forest.

803
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,230
Starts praying that shift from the sky 
hollows chem trail,

804
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:43,940
planes and all these Wackos or worried 
about,

805
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,893
let's have those fuckers for real.
Just fill them up with water and just 

806
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,260
dump it on us.

807
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,280
Just get those giant planes filled with 
water and just dump water and everybody,

808
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,310
surely a million dollar idea.
Uh,

809
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,620
I think it probably costs a little more 
than that,

810
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,680
but I was thinking of the earnings if 
you can manage to figure out how to,

811
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,990
how to extract that.
So they actually have,

812
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,660
um,
a desalination plant that they are going

813
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:08,090
online with this year,
I believe in San Diego.

814
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,890
Is that this year?
Do you know that story?

815
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:11,510
Jamie?
Um,

816
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,180
there was a,
uh,

817
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,113
there apparently they do have emerging 
technologies to extract salt from water 

818
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,243
and they've used them in the Middle East
where they just have ungodly amounts of 

819
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:23,020
money.
You know,

820
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,670
they just have so much money over there 
because of the oil that some of these,

821
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,890
some of these dudes have,
uh,

822
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,203
tried to use that money to create 
machines that can suck the salt out of 

823
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:33,680
the water and figure out some way to 
filter it.

824
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,050
Bill Gates can drink water from his own 
shit.

825
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,130
You'd like to think that someone could 
do what he's doing.

826
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,113
What he did,
he'd been invented a machine that we 

827
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:43,460
extracted water from human shit.
And then he was like,

828
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,250
from actual shit from like think it was,
I think it was shit,

829
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,203
we'll use the word sewage just for the 
sake of making a little more broader 

830
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,503
spectrum of.
Well that's what you do when you have 

831
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:58,191
$90,000,000,000 bold.
Everybody's getting Fiji and heavy on.

832
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:01,020
And I heard Fiji's not even really from 
Fiji.

833
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:03,480
Those fucks I heard.
That's bullshit.

834
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,870
Yeah.
I heard Fiji is just some fucking.

835
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,910
Just some spring water from the middle 
of nowhere.

836
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,860
Plant opened up December 14th.
Oh,

837
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:11,790
did open up.
Okay.

838
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,760
So went online at the end of 2015.
That's interesting.

839
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:15,750
It's good.
Huge developments.

840
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,040
That's gonna happen.
That's gonna.

841
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,310
Fix the whole fucking problem.
We're going to go Jesus Christ.

842
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,144
Why we were right next to so much water.
You have to fly over it in a fucking 

843
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:27,780
plane and it takes 16 hours to get to 
the other side.

844
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,580
And I'm just going to.
And I'm going to plead ignorant here,

845
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:31,990
but why are we not just showering with 
saltwater,

846
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,940
maybe extinguishing fires with 
saltwater.

847
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,853
Why are we not using the salt water in 
different capacities that we're not 

848
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,800
imposing so much?
Good question to,

849
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,140
to,
to process it.

850
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,770
Um,
uh,

851
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,603
the thing about saltwater is it does 
corrode things like really badly if 

852
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:47,340
you're near the ocean.
Uh,

853
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:48,174
I have a friend who has a beach house 
and every time we go to hang out with 

854
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:53,640
them and his beach house,
like everything's like all fucked up and

855
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:54,474
corroded.
Like they're constantly dealing with 

856
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:56,970
corrosion because of the salt in the 
air.

857
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,180
It's just a constant moisture and salt 
together.

858
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:02,250
They corrode the shit out of things.
That's why I'm.

859
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,980
Why used to live in Boston?
The uh,

860
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,903
cars are always fucked up like old cars.
It's hard to find like if you want to 

861
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:11,580
find like a 1970 plymouth or something 
like that,

862
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,683
it's hard to find one that's in good 
shape because they're all rusted out 

863
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:17,150
from the salt that they throw in the 
ground when it,

864
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,110
when it snows out to melt the snow.

865
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,750
So that's why my cars were all fucked 
up.

866
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,550
Right.
So the point being almond milk,

867
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,710
the problem with almond milk,
because it uses a lot of water,

868
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,310
they use a shitload of almonds.
I guess you're extracting very little of

869
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:30,144
the,
of the nutritional value from the 

870
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:33,660
almonds per capita if you will,
like versus like this mass amount.

871
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,280
Right?
But writing it down or what?

872
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,560
That's what I say,
dude,

873
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:38,790
fuck them.
Okay.

874
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:41,100
So I'll eat almost all day.
Not Care about their life.

875
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,590
That's the thing about life.
We don't really.

876
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,840
We don't really care much about plant 
life.

877
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,703
We want it to be there,
but we don't think about it the way we 

878
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:51,540
think about animal life.
Like we want animal life to be there,

879
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,210
but we don't want anybody to kill it.
Like plant life.

880
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:55,044
The only time people get bummed out 
about plants and someone chops down 

881
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,920
ancient redwood or something like that.

882
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,820
Like,
Oh God,

883
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:00,960
how could you.
And again,

884
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:01,794
I've read somewhere where plants can 
actually hear when they're being eaten 

885
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,753
and I've seen some studies,
or rather I read something somewhere 

886
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:08,934
again,
where a plant has a similar hunting 

887
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,903
behavior as animals,
where they're actually the roots will 

888
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,980
physically chase or get fined their 
nutrients.

889
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,820
So,
you know,

890
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,240
some would argue that,
uh,

891
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,270
that plants are just as conscious or 
conceivably conscious as a,

892
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,480
as animals as well.
Well,

893
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:27,720
they're different in the same way that 
humans are different than dolphins.

894
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,160
We were talking about the intelligence 
level of an Orca versus the intelligence

895
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:32,994
level of a person.
Like we would like to think that we're 

896
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:36,010
smarter

897
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,600
than them,
but there's no evidence of that.

898
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:38,434
If we lived in the ocean,
we would look like fucking idiots if we 

899
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:42,520
were swimming around with them trying to
stay alive,

900
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,090
they'd be like,
look at these dummies with their fingers

901
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,810
and they're exposed.
Dick's,

902
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,020
he's going to eat by crabs.
These fucks,

903
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,280
they can't even sleep in the water.
Like what are they going to die?

904
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,110
They would think we were retarded.
Right?

905
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,153
So that's sort of how you know when we 
look at their life and what they're 

906
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:02,104
doing,
like they're perfectly adapted to their 

907
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:04,660
environment.
Well,

908
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,553
a tree is perfectly adapted to it's 
environment and there's been a lot of 

909
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:11,554
research done on plant intelligence and 
there is a lot of evidence to suggest 

910
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:19,990
that these aren't inanimate objects like
a rock.

911
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,970
It just happens to get larger every 
year.

912
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,370
No,
these are living things.

913
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,233
They're living things that do 
calculations that somehow or another 

914
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:29,350
communicate with each other.

915
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,680
They let other plants know when they're 
being preyed upon.

916
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,753
They develop methods in order to 
discourage predation and that's where 

917
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,180
poisonous plants come from.
All poisons.

918
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:43,470
Plants come from discouraging predation.
That's what.

919
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,423
That's what it's all about.
It's funny because one of the cruelest 

920
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:48,064
things I've ever watched,
and maybe it's because I have a vivid 

921
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:50,764
imagination,
but if you've ever seen a venus fly 

922
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:55,840
trap,
it's like slowly dissolve.

923
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,810
You know its prey.
It's like wild shit.

924
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,710
Pretty evil.
Yeah.

925
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,680
Well there's one that aedes rats,
there's a fucking plan.

926
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:05,740
The Amazon that looks like a giant tulip
that each route.

927
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,420
Pull that up,
Jamie.

928
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,860
A rat eating plant and it's,
it's a plant,

929
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:15,400
it's like it has like a sickly sweet 
smell to it apparently,

930
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,683
and these animals go in it looking for 
food and they go and just close in on 

931
00:40:21,891 --> 00:40:23,350
them and they don't fight and kill them.

932
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:28,240
They slowly enveloping,
just smush them,

933
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,920
just trap them,
smash them,

934
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:30,754
and then absorb their nutrients,
break them down to the very molecules 

935
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:39,331
and protein and liquids are going to get
250 people would sign out of plants.

936
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:41,370
Doorstep,
protest them.

937
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,910
Well,
plants are alive,

938
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:45,220
man.
We need to eat living things.

939
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,360
Life eats life live feeds on life that 
it just does.

940
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,270
And what's going on now with animal 
rights,

941
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,373
activism and pita and the Animal 
Liberation Organization is people who 

942
00:40:57,701 --> 00:40:59,170
care.
That's what really is.

943
00:40:59,171 --> 00:41:01,120
Whether they're misguided,
whether I agree with him.

944
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,433
There are people who care and there are 
people who feel deeply about these 

945
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,690
animals.
Check this motherfucker out.

946
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,120
Watch this shit.
That's hunting behavior for sure.

947
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,330
Look at this case will be fishing.
What happened?

948
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:15,130
We went,
here we go,

949
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,960
here we go.
So this thing,

950
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,700
um,
it,

951
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,630
it has like this open leaf.
And these plants,

952
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,453
what are we watching here?
This is like a fast speed up version of 

953
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:29,610
it.
So what happens is,

954
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:31,900
um,
is it growing here?

955
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,310
Is that we're watching.
I thought final countdown

956
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,143
was about to play it that way too quick.
It was just a mouse falling into a 

957
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,130
plant.
So I didn't want to go with that.

958
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,860
And this one was a guy in front of one,
but this is,

959
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:45,320
um,
we're watching the whole fucker grow.

960
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,240
This isn't.
So this is what happens.

961
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,410
This is,
this is where it is.

962
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,370
It opens up and it looks like almost 
like a hamper.

963
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,220
We throwing a closing or something or 
strange green vagina.

964
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,080
And that looks like a snake.
Like that's crazy.

965
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,480
Yeah.
Well there's a lot of that in the animal

966
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:00,490
world.
Um,

967
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,710
this is all just growth though.
We're watching like high speed rail.

968
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,420
We're not gonna watch it,
eat anything.

969
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:06,254
Jamie.
We're going to have to find another 

970
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:08,870
video.
When these things open up,

971
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:14,050
they open up and the rats are attracted 
to the smell and they climb in that tube

972
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,610
and when they climb in that tube,
they wind up dying.

973
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,840
Show the one that,
uh,

974
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,420
that has a hair goes eatsa fraud.
Here.

975
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:21,620
Go.
This is perfect.

976
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,520
This is the one that's just going to 
close right up on it.

977
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,600
It already did.
Jamie.

978
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:30,260
Just watched this.
Just do it from the beginning.

979
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,990
Here it goes.
Watch this.

980
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,190
He's just hanging out.
Like,

981
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:35,024
what's that smell?
Let me just blew up and that it eats 

982
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:37,994
him.
It's over.

983
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:38,980
Yeah,
it eats a.

984
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,213
and this is a new plant.
They've only discovered this fucker I 

985
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:45,280
think like five or six years ago.
And um,

986
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,530
eat frogs,
all sorts of things.

987
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,480
Look at this.
Watch this because this Venus flytrap.

988
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,600
Wow.
That's a wrap.

989
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,190
Bitch.
That's cold blooded.

990
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,530
That is so fucked up.
Play that again.

991
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,800
Could God that fucking frog.
Okay.

992
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,790
He's like,
what's the smell?

993
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,120
So I bought.
That is so crazy.

994
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,950
I said it's one of the.
For me anyways.

995
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,370
That's one of the toughest things to 
watch.

996
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,673
I think it's ours.
That poor animals are going to be just 

997
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:11,920
laying there a incapacitated until 
ultimately wow.

998
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,510
If it's suffocated than it is what it 
is.

999
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,230
No.
A Venus flytrap could do that.

1000
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:16,064
I didn't know the Ada frog.
Is that a different plant or is that a 

1001
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:20,330
Venus flytrap?
It looks like the fingers.

1002
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,243
It's just.
I know that's what those plants have 

1003
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:28,760
figured out is their method to get 
ahead.

1004
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,230
That's their hustle.
There.

1005
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:34,070
Hustle is they trap things and they suck
them into their body and they eat them.

1006
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,980
They survived.
They evolve and get bigger.

1007
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,230
Get stronger.
Yeah.

1008
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,450
Those are predators,
man.

1009
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:40,310
These are carnivores.
So look at these.

1010
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,470
Look at these fucking hands getting 
killed by this plant.

1011
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,410
Oh my God.
There's so many of them,

1012
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:46,910
man.
There's so many different.

1013
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:47,930
Weird one.
Look at this.

1014
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,540
They roll up these ants.
Oh,

1015
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:51,374
this is so creepy.
It looks like a giant green tongue with 

1016
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:55,094
like weird sort of spikes that grow on 
it and the spikes lift up and wrap 

1017
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:01,334
around the aunt or the fly here in this 
case and just trap them and once they 

1018
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:09,110
have them trapped in there and he's 
stuck in the stickiness of the.

1019
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,633
Look at this with these ants and then it
wraps up and rolls them up like a 

1020
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:14,834
Burrito.

1021
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,290
That's fucked up,
man.

1022
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:22,220
That was a tough place here.
It doesn't give a fuck,

1023
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,310
but I think nature is beautiful.
I think it's amazing.

1024
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,323
I think if you really want to see nature
of the weight of see it is obviously 

1025
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:31,440
documentaries and dvds if you want to 
stay in home,

1026
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,310
but

1027
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,040
to actually see the physical animal go 
somewhere,

1028
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,083
go somewhere and see them,
go see them in their natural 

1029
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:37,884
environment.
That's what you're going to get a real 

1030
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:39,810
respect for them.
Absolutely.

1031
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,550
Yeah.
I'm taking one of my upcoming trips this

1032
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,650
year.
I want to take my kids with me.

1033
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,360
I'm not when I kill an animal because I 
don't want to make any noise.

1034
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:52,194
I don't want to have to quiet them down 
because it's a very patient thing and 

1035
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,050
it's something that will be very hard 
for a five year old to do.

1036
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,150
Would you take issue with them seeing 
the kill itself?

1037
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,070
No.
They've watched it on TV.

1038
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,370
They've seen the meat,
they've seen me butcher meat.

1039
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,380
They haven't seen me kill the whole 
animal,

1040
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:12,381
but they've seen me chop up a giant elk 
backstrap and turn it into steaks in the

1041
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,190
middle of the kitchen just sitting there
with a cutting board,

1042
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:16,024
slicing it up and they ask questions and
there's a disconnect between that meet 

1043
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:19,720
having been a live animal.

1044
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,050
No,
no standing.

1045
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:21,923
Well,
they've seen me on television kill 

1046
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,700
animals on a TV show.
Okay.

1047
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,553
So they know that I do it.
They know that I have targets in the 

1048
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:33,040
yard and I'm always practicing arrows 
and archery.

1049
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,930
But um,
I want what I want to do is not,

1050
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:36,803
not even the hunting aspect of it.
I want to take them so they could see 

1051
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:44,361
the elk when elk are running and they're
screaming is amazing.

1052
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,324
It's like you're in Jurassic Park.
It's like you run some hobbit movie or 

1053
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:50,470
something when you're in the hills.
Like,

1054
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,840
um,
what I want to do is I'm going to,

1055
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:52,903
I want to plan a week of hunting and 
then I want to pay a guide just to call 

1056
00:45:55,981 --> 00:46:00,180
in the elk so we could just watch them 
because I just want the kids to see what

1057
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:01,014
it's like when you make this noise and 
then you see this fucking thing looks 

1058
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:08,970
like a giant forest horse that comes up 
and wants to fuck.

1059
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,800
And they're screaming.
They have this crazy whale.

1060
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,853
It's,
it's amazing to watch outside of 

1061
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,810
hunting,
like separate that,

1062
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,730
that's,
that's all great and everything,

1063
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:25,470
but just be just being a part of the 
environment,

1064
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:26,304
like stepping on the ground where these 
things live wild and they all they're 

1065
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:30,414
worried about.
It's like mountain lions and bears and 

1066
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,710
that's what they're doing.
They're trying to stay alive.

1067
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:35,544
They're trying to get laid and they're,
they're existing in this very bizarre 

1068
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:43,020
world that we rarely get to see that we 
can't really truly appreciate it because

1069
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,153
we don't have to worry about it.
We don't have to worry about what their 

1070
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,930
concerns are anymore.
We even like,

1071
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,120
look at Africa,
man.

1072
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,300
They have these tourism things they do 
in Africa,

1073
00:46:51,301 --> 00:46:52,134
but a good percentage of them are in 
these high fence operations where 

1074
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:56,334
they've sort of fenced in these animals 
and these giant contained wildlife 

1075
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,940
sanctuaries and the animals thrive in 
there.

1076
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,043
But how do you see,
you mean the way you see him as he get 

1077
00:47:05,661 --> 00:47:09,350
in a jeep and you drive around and even 
if it's something,

1078
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,210
there's something fucked up about 
knowing that they're not,

1079
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,260
they can't leave even if it's like 10 
miles in every direction,

1080
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:19,500
there's a fence and they would never 
Rome 10 miles in the wild.

1081
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,633
The fact that there's a fence at all,
the fact that we've gotten are greasy 

1082
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:27,210
little hands or in their world,
it kinda changes it in a way.

1083
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,250
Well,
it's funny because I actually a running

1084
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,690
deer,
a male of course,

1085
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:32,843
uh,
trying to enter the premises of marine 

1086
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:38,500
land and there's a large fence around it
and this thing was.

1087
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:40,150
So.
I mean,

1088
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:40,984
uh,
running deere is actually a pretty 

1089
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:43,450
dangerous animal.
I mean,

1090
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:45,350
they are,
they are there.

1091
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,620
Their sexual urges are far beyond any 
type of.

1092
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,320
Like it just trumps any behavior that 
they would have.

1093
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:51,154
So this thing was smashing,
it must've been smelling the females 

1094
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:54,454
inside the park,
but it was repeatedly smashing itself 

1095
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:56,404
against the fence trying to get in to 
the point where he'd ripped half its 

1096
00:47:58,391 --> 00:48:00,370
face off,
its antlers were getting fucked up.

1097
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,490
So we actually called a hunter who had 
been in the back like,

1098
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,890
who had had the,
the permission by the owner of Greenland

1099
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,890
to hunt inside some wild deer.
And we went and got him and he came,

1100
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,170
put the first boat directly through the 
animal,

1101
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:13,420
didn't kill it,
got a second bowl and then uh,

1102
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:14,260
took,
uh,

1103
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,430
put the animal down and won't kill it.

1104
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:17,720
And then we had to sausage some,
some time later.

1105
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:18,820
Of course.
Yeah,

1106
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:21,550
they get crazy.
Moose are super aggressive when they get

1107
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:23,110
horny,
they're dangerous.

1108
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,290
I've been in Algonquin Park at the times
when,

1109
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:26,570
uh,
when uh,

1110
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,423
the Moose are running.
And that is by far the most dangerous 

1111
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:31,000
animal out there for you.
I mean,

1112
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,030
you don't want to get anywhere near a 
running moocs.

1113
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,500
They're so big.
Have you ever seen one in the wild?

1114
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:35,921
I have,
yeah,

1115
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:39,880
of course.
The first time I saw one out in the wild

1116
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:44,881
was in the middle of British Columbia in
the forest and it was like the first one

1117
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:48,190
I saw it was a female and we saw them in
the distance and I was like,

1118
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,113
oh my.
It was like that scene in Jurassic Park 

1119
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:53,710
where Jeff Goldbloom lifts his head up 
out of the jeep and it's like,

1120
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:55,210
what?
Like,

1121
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:57,010
you can't believe how big they are.

1122
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,490
They're like the males get to 1800 
pounds,

1123
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,713
1800 pounds.
Like the biggest elk that I killed was 

1124
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:04,834
around a thousand pounds.
So imagine something fucking twice the 

1125
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:08,620
size of that.
Drive your car.

1126
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,120
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1127
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:11,530
Yeah.
Well my friend,

1128
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,210
my friend Mike Hawk Ridge who runs a big
country outfitters up there,

1129
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,140
he got chased by a female Moose on a 
horse.

1130
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,260
He was on his horse and the female had 
the caps with them,

1131
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:24,094
which is when they get really fucking 
dangerous and they get aggressive and 

1132
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:27,903
the horse was running in the fucking 
moose was gaining on them and he was 

1133
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:31,810
like,
Holy Shit.

1134
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,850
And he realized like,
Oh my God,

1135
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:37,120
like this is fucking,
this could be good to the horse.

1136
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:40,480
Kept his cool or kept it its footing at 
least that have fucked up scene.

1137
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,550
Oh yeah.
Well if the horse slipped and fell or if

1138
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:45,220
the horse said,
fuck this guy on my back like I'm out.

1139
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:46,543
I don't think he could.
I mean he had a saddle and everything 

1140
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:50,140
like that.
I don't know if the horse was that smart

1141
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,570
point to what we're saying is a almond 
milk is bullshit.

1142
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:57,130
That's,
that's the bottom line.

1143
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,630
Almond milks sucks.
It's all right.

1144
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,823
So,
um,

1145
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,650
what has changed since the two years 
that you've been here?

1146
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:06,484
Other than there's a lot of public 
acknowledgement and understanding now 

1147
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:10,384
that wasn't available or wasn't.
It sort of wasn't at the level that it 

1148
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:14,314
is now.
I think people are much more outraged 

1149
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:16,924
now about seaworld and about a marine 
land and just the idea of captive orcas 

1150
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:26,200
and dolphins.
And in your case walruses well.

1151
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:28,040
So the first thing we did was we managed

1152
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,790
to ban a orchid captivity in Ontario.
That's,

1153
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,590
that's done now.
So marine land will never.

1154
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:35,900
And Mark my word,
they will never acquire another,

1155
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,500
a killer whale,
whether it be a wild caught or not.

1156
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,510
So that was a big win for animal 
activists,

1157
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:42,344
if you will,
or anyone for that matter has invested 

1158
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:48,401
interest in the wellbeing of animals 
just as of January first 2016.

1159
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:49,694
Now,
uh,

1160
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,633
there are standards of care,
which is what I actually petitioned the 

1161
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:53,444
government for back in 2012 because when
I came out and sort of revealed marine 

1162
00:50:58,941 --> 00:51:00,890
land for what it actually is behind the 
scenes,

1163
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:02,330
uh,
during that time,

1164
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:03,164
there were no standards of care.
You could literally have dug a hole in 

1165
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:07,610
your backyard,
fill it with whatever you want and then,

1166
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,530
you know,
plunk yourself some dolphins in there.

1167
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,480
And that was fine.
There were no standards of care.

1168
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,740
There was no,
uh,

1169
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,740
oversight in any capacity.
That's changed.

1170
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:18,620
I'll be at the letter of the regulations
that we have now.

1171
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:20,450
I would say that few people are really 
satisfied.

1172
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,770
There's still lots of work to do with 
them,

1173
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:23,840
but the fact alone that they are now 
legislated,

1174
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,320
we'll be able to,
uh,

1175
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,770
to change some of the,
the,

1176
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,340
the,
the parameters,

1177
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,323
you know,
the one of the biggest things that 

1178
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:31,490
there's in fact water quality 
parameters.

1179
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,571
Uh,
when I,

1180
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:34,370
in the last eight months of my tenure at
marine land,

1181
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:36,200
I was witnessed to,
um,

1182
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,540
some of the more horrific things that a,
that caustic water can do to animals.

1183
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,660
Uh,
I witnessed dolphins lose their skin.

1184
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:45,494
I mean the skin was flaking off,
literally flaking off their skin and 

1185
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,640
we're not talking about it.
Just a regular slough.

1186
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,073
Uh,
there was some permanent idemage that 

1187
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:52,790
was done.

1188
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,623
What happened was there was,
there was a breakdown in a disinfection 

1189
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:57,260
unit,
a water disinfection unit.

1190
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,810
We used to use ozone in conjunction with
chlorine.

1191
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:02,750
Ozone mitigated the use of chlorine,
so he didn't have to use so much of it.

1192
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,973
And when that machine broke down,
the resolve was just keep pumping more 

1193
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,930
chlorine and keep pumping more clearance
flirting.

1194
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,520
And because we were in the off season,
the public wasn't seeing this.

1195
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,470
Okay.
And this is 2012.

1196
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:16,160
I had an old shitty blackberry,
but I knew I was conscious enough of how

1197
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:17,900
bad things were that I started snapping 
photos,

1198
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,153
taking videos and you know,
there was a major complacency for 

1199
00:52:21,811 --> 00:52:22,644
management because hey shit,
we're not opening again for another 

1200
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,760
eight months or six months,
whatever it be.

1201
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,653
I think the issue started in October.
They opened in November and so there 

1202
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:32,060
were no parameters.
There was no oversight.

1203
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,430
There was nowhere for me to run to find 
help.

1204
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,373
Now there is that.
So now marina has to adhere to new 

1205
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,880
legislation that will require some 
capital investment from them,

1206
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,730
which of course is something that we'd 
like to hear,

1207
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,143
um,
but there's at least some stuff in 

1208
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:50,864
place.
And most importantly is most recently 

1209
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:55,550
there's a senator,
a federal Canadian senator,

1210
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,070
a liberal senator by the name of,
of uh,

1211
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,170
Willie Moore is what we're actually the 
Hashtag.

1212
00:53:00,171 --> 00:53:01,004
We're saying free willy more and sort of
a in the hopes of getting Justin 

1213
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,290
Trudeau's attention.
And he's introduced the bill.

1214
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:09,230
It's called the ending of captivity of 
whales and Dolphins Act.

1215
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,710
It's a bill,
a two.

1216
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:13,011
Oh,
three,

1217
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:14,430
I believe,
and uh,

1218
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,330
this bill,
once it passed the Senate and ultimately

1219
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:21,260
passes into law,
is going to ban both the import,

1220
00:53:21,261 --> 00:53:24,770
the breeding of all whales,
porpoises captivity or rather,

1221
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:26,580
and whales in captivity in Canada.

1222
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,240
Basically putting a shelf life on marine
land in the capacity that they,

1223
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,500
that they do business.
Now,

1224
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,930
this is a bill that I'm urging people.
Look if you,

1225
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:40,110
if you give a shit about animals in 
captivity,

1226
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:41,610
you know,
a tweet,

1227
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:45,510
Justin Trudeau are our recently elected 
prime minister.

1228
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,520
And uh,
yeah,

1229
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:48,480
we're,
we're really trying to,

1230
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:50,040
we're looking forward to moving this 
thing forward.

1231
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,540
Beyond that,
it's always a,

1232
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,780
it's always a thing about the,
the what I call the paradigm shift.

1233
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,233
Um,
people don't want to see the only visit 

1234
00:53:57,421 --> 00:53:58,254
zoos,
no more attendance at marina is a 

1235
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:00,243
nihilistic.
Now this doesn't stop him from exacting 

1236
00:54:01,861 --> 00:54:04,440
a gross revenge on me,
but nonetheless,

1237
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,274
we're still afloat.
We're still here three years later 

1238
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:09,030
amidst all these bullshit lawsuits as I 
stressed before,

1239
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:09,864
these slapp lawsuits,
strategic lawsuit against public 

1240
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,624
participation when I got sued,
well had hope to one day we'd be in 

1241
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:16,680
court.

1242
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,790
Here we are well over a thousand days 
later and not,

1243
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,030
and I've spent,
well I say I've spent,

1244
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:23,220
but we've publicly raised a lot of 
money.

1245
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,583
We spent collectively over the three 
former animals trainers that are turned 

1246
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:29,364
whistleblowers.
We've collectively spent over $100,000 

1247
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,033
and not had a single day in court.
So it's all just trying to drain you 

1248
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,510
legally.
Joe.

1249
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:37,344
The fact alone that I'm speaking into 
this microphone is exactly what Marine 

1250
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:41,063
Lynn doesn't want.
I'm dangerous to the anti captivity or 

1251
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:45,660
rather the captivity industry because I 
know a lot of things.

1252
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:49,800
Of course seaworld was if you want to 
use the term in bed with marine land,

1253
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:50,973
a seaworld likes to acquire because 
because in the states you can't acquire 

1254
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,013
a wild caught animals at seaworld would 
do is they would get the animals that 

1255
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:00,923
marine land would import.
So marina would import wild cod belugas 

1256
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:03,923
from Russia breed them,
and because the calves were bred in 

1257
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:10,020
captivity,
they could now be moved to the states.

1258
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,033
So this was how seaworld in the states 
was trying to continue to acquire these 

1259
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:16,570
animals.
So that's,

1260
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,230
and this is exactly what this bill is 
sort of trying to stop,

1261
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:20,303
so that's one of the things that sea 
world was full of shit about because 

1262
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:22,974
seaworld was trying to say we haven't 
done like one of one of their 

1263
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:27,810
commercials was saying that they 
haven't,

1264
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,200
they haven't caught in a whale in 35 
years.

1265
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:32,043
Yeah.
They haven't captured a whale from the 

1266
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:33,804
wild in 35 years.
There's a number of examples of that 

1267
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:36,144
being bullshit.
One being a wild orca or what they 

1268
00:55:38,611 --> 00:55:39,444
deemed rescued,
orca named Morgan that was captured off 

1269
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:44,150
the coast of the Netherlands who was,
you know,

1270
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,180
it was by itself.
It had left it's potter,

1271
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,650
it was,
it had lost contact with his pod.

1272
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,960
And so it's a,
it's a,

1273
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:55,160
a dolphinarium called Darfur,
dolphinarium hi bike.

1274
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,590
They acquired this animal and then what 
they did or they took it and they called

1275
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:01,050
it rehabbing and then they,
of course demon non releasable.

1276
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,230
They sent it to a place and it's 
outlined in a black blackfish.

1277
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:05,670
In fact because there's a,
there's a large,

1278
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:06,900
uh,
the documentary blackfish.

1279
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,960
There's a relationship between seaworld 
and,

1280
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,080
uh,
a facility called in tenor reef.

1281
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:14,363
It's called Laurel parking.
So what seaworld did was they had that 

1282
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:19,780
animal Morgan,
the wild Orca,

1283
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,260
transferred to,
um,

1284
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,100
to Laurel Park and now

1285
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,490
it's actually part enlisted as part of 
its collection.

1286
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,953
That's a wild caught animals.
So seaworld was sit there and tell this 

1287
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:33,340
idea that we haven't done this in years 
and yet they're,

1288
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,573
they're importing wild,
wild caught animals that have just 

1289
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:40,930
recently bred one the babies from Canada
and then they're,

1290
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:44,710
they're basically adding to their,
to their stock of animals.

1291
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:45,873
This other wild caught animals.
So we can talk about the bullshit that 

1292
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,143
seaworld spews all day.
But the nice thing is most people are 

1293
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:53,410
now conscious of it.
Most people look at it and say,

1294
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,000
I mean every time seaworld tweets,
anything,

1295
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:55,834
they get a lot of fucking hate because 
people know now they know they're 

1296
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,660
essentially a slavery organization.
Yeah.

1297
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,583
I can't disagree.
And saying that we haven't captured a 

1298
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:06,610
slave in 35 years,
it's still disgusting.

1299
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,930
The idea that that's how that's okay,
that they can just say,

1300
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,140
we haven't participated in slavery 
catching slaves in 35 years.

1301
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:19,390
We just keep them here.
Locked in a tiny little.

1302
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,160
Have you ever seen the map?
I'm sure you have.

1303
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,313
The parking lot is in juxtaposition to 
the actual area where the dolphins give 

1304
00:57:26,501 --> 00:57:28,270
to swim.
The most heartbreaking one is would that

1305
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:31,360
pool is right next to the ocean when you
could see it physically right there.

1306
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,210
There's a lot of facilities with the 
dolphins or spy hopping and they can see

1307
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:35,530
the.
See it's right there.

1308
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,393
The ocean is right there.
It's a question of picking them up and 

1309
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:38,404
throwing them back in there.
Why can't they make it so that they can 

1310
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:42,364
go back and forth?
Why can't they make it so that they can 

1311
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:50,101
have like set up a facility?
This is the way you can make it.

1312
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:51,124
Some of these animals can transition 
back into the wild and that if they do 

1313
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:56,080
decide to come and participate in show 
that they could do it on their own.

1314
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,913
Free will have like an open area where 
it's connected to like a dock where the 

1315
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:03,640
pools and the areas where the animals 
swim,

1316
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:07,900
they should be examined by some marine 
biologists.

1317
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,050
That demon ethical,
this is an enormous place as long as you

1318
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:11,884
don't keep them in here,
but they can do their stuff in here and 

1319
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:18,751
everything will be fine and have it be 
actual ocean water and then have an open

1320
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:21,770
portal so you don't have to worry about 
them starving to death in a wild.

1321
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,613
They can always come in and get food 
anytime they want and that way you can 

1322
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:25,594
kind of keep both things happening like 
they develop a relationship with these 

1323
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:31,780
animals where it's a.
it's an actual real relationship.

1324
00:58:31,781 --> 00:58:32,614
It's not captivity.
They come because they want to get food 

1325
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,430
sorta like squirrels,
the park or something.

1326
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,610
This is exactly what animal rights 
people if you will,

1327
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:42,090
and and scientists these days are 
advocating for.

1328
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,210
They want seaside sanctuaries where 
which these animals remain in human care

1329
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,523
and are available for people to watch.
Of course you're going to have to keep 

1330
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,280
the stop.
The breeding,

1331
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:52,480
the breeding has got to stop.
Ultimately,

1332
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:54,340
you want to phrase this this out 
completely,

1333
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:56,140
unless they want to fuck on their own in
front of everybody,

1334
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,440
I'm going to guess that people are,
that the scientists going to try to stop

1335
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:00,274
that,
but that's what people are advocating 

1336
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:05,530
for really is the seaside sanctuaries.
But seaworld keeps saying that,

1337
00:59:05,531 --> 00:59:06,364
oh,
there's so many pathogens in the water 

1338
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:09,220
and it's going to make these animals to 
central.

1339
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,150
Again,
it's all bullshit.

1340
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:11,260
You just mean.
Well,

1341
00:59:11,261 --> 00:59:13,570
it means they think that they're going 
to become susceptible and say,

1342
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:14,503
or that or that.
The transition itself from captivity 

1343
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:18,040
into this new environment is going to be
too much to stomach.

1344
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,113
Well,
where was that logic when they were 

1345
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:20,584
plucking them out of the,
out of the ocean and putting them in 

1346
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:22,460
these concrete tanks?

1347
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:22,941
Right?
Well,

1348
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:23,774
they're going to have to adapt if,
if they changed the laws and they make 

1349
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:28,191
it so that,
that's,

1350
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,024
um,
that's just the only acceptable 

1351
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,390
solution.
Then they'll adapt.

1352
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,170
There wasn't any way.
There was a law,

1353
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,213
uh,
introduce a couple of years ago by his 

1354
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:37,454
name was assemblyman Richard Bloom.
And it was a bill that ultimately was 

1355
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:44,810
going to retire all the orcas in San 
Diego to seaside sanctuaries.

1356
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,070
The issue that was raised is that there 
are no seaside sanctuaries yet.

1357
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,100
And so the bill ultimately died.
Well,

1358
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,020
fucking seaworld use your money,
bitch.

1359
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:54,570
What?
Yeah.

1360
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:55,403
You have a giant facility.
You obviously made money off of those 

1361
00:59:58,281 --> 00:59:59,610
things.
What,

1362
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,510
how down are they right now?
Yeah.

1363
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,473
Well their net worth or rather their,
their company valuation when they did 

1364
01:00:06,441 --> 01:00:09,980
their initial IPO,
initial public offering was uh,

1365
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,850
in and around $2,000,000,000.
And basically that's down to one point.

1366
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,710
It was down to one point five at one 
point seven.

1367
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:16,830
So,
you know,

1368
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,620
animal activism,
if you will,

1369
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,440
has really caused them a lot of harm 
financially.

1370
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:24,590
They've literally taken,
I'm just aware that they're not,

1371
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,750
they're not.
Well of course they're still worth a lot

1372
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,940
of money.
But for a slave organization to be worth

1373
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,100
over a billion dollars,
that's kind of fucked.

1374
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,970
And then you could buy stock in the 
slave organization.

1375
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,650
Yeah.
What the fuck man,

1376
01:00:36,651 --> 01:00:38,280
I watched that stock price daily.
I mean,

1377
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,390
they're not recovering that man.
Are they?

1378
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:41,263
Have they rebounded?
Is that wasn't showing depending on 

1379
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:46,240
where they're at today because of us.
Well,

1380
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:47,450
look it,
look at yesterday.

1381
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,160
Look,
people don't like me.

1382
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,033
Fuck a reuben.
I'm going to get a lot of that to pump 

1383
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,710
your money in the seaworld,
the others and investment.

1384
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:56,203
Yeah.
Well it's not going to be around in 20 

1385
01:00:58,131 --> 01:01:00,020
or 30 years,
so you're right.

1386
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,363
It's more,
the more we do research into the 

1387
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,310
language of these things to the more 
scientists.

1388
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,490
I mean they've been trying to,
you know,

1389
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,610
John Lilly was trying to get them to 
speak human.

1390
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,110
He was trying to get them to speak human
languages like way back in,

1391
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,010
I guess it was like the sixties.
Yeah.

1392
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:24,590
And he even set up an experiment where a
woman lived in sort of this bizarre home

1393
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,200
where there was water.
She spent most of her time,

1394
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:31,720
like waist deep in water.
Yeah.

1395
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,640
Which wasn't jagging off the dolphin.
That was the problem.

1396
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:37,520
She checked off the Dolphin Dolphins get
horny.

1397
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:38,121
And she was like,
well,

1398
01:01:38,121 --> 01:01:40,160
this is a distraction.
Let me just check them off real quick.

1399
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:41,390
And,
and everybody's like,

1400
01:01:41,391 --> 01:01:41,801
Whoa,
Whoa,

1401
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:42,280
Whoa,
whoa,

1402
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:42,860
Whoa,
whoa.

1403
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,800
What the fuck did you just say?
And that's really,

1404
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:45,643
we've come a long way since then because
clearly that was just a question of the 

1405
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:48,440
animal mimicking.

1406
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,273
I mean,
the idea that this animal's going to 

1407
01:01:49,641 --> 01:01:51,230
adopt the English language over and 
above.

1408
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:52,223
Yeah.
But,

1409
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,083
but to be fair,
the mimicry itself was pretty 

1410
01:01:54,351 --> 01:01:55,310
impressive,
pretty impressive.

1411
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:56,810
And I've worked with dolphins and I 
never,

1412
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,540
I never actually tried to have the 
dolphin mimic my own sound,

1413
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:02,900
but with what I was watching that duck,
I watched a documentary recently as well

1414
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,700
is uh,
it was pretty impressive.

1415
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,110
It's pretty impressive.
Very.

1416
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,003
But the idea that that was teaching or 
trying to bridge the communication was 

1417
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,480
pretty.
I mean,

1418
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:12,350
that's,
that's out there.

1419
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:13,243
Well,
it was all lily could come up with back 

1420
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:15,230
then.
At the time,

1421
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,260
first of all,
he was on acid almost every day.

1422
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,310
I mean,
lily was a fucking maniac.

1423
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,050
You take ketamine and he was the guy 
that invented the isolation tank,

1424
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,810
which is one of my favorite things in 
the world.

1425
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,640
I have yet to do it.
I can't wait to though.

1426
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:30,810
I'm going to.
How long you here for?

1427
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,380
I'm here till uh,
I leave Friday morning.

1428
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:36,180
Like hell yeah.
I love that.

1429
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,043
Will set it.
Set you up with the end of the float 

1430
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:40,080
lab.
There's a new place in Pasadena and that

1431
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:42,180
just opened up the largest place in the 
world.

1432
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,380
Yeah.
Very interesting.

1433
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,700
Yeah,
we'll look it up.

1434
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,810
That's fantastic.
Appreciate that.

1435
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,670
What part of town he's staying in while 
you're here?

1436
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:49,200
We're going to be in Venice beach.
Oh,

1437
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,970
Jesus Christ.
That's where the float lab is.

1438
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:52,050
Oh,
how about that dude?

1439
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:52,884
That's perfect.
That we're going to call them right 

1440
01:02:54,361 --> 01:02:55,590
after this.
We'll set it up.

1441
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,580
I'm extending because crash is the best 
car.

1442
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,750
I've heard that.
He's been on the podcast before.

1443
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:02,460
He's a fucking maniac.
I love him.

1444
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:08,150
And he kept the float business alive 
with innovation back when no one did.

1445
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,213
Um,
I had a guy who was fixing my tank and 

1446
01:03:11,991 --> 01:03:12,690
um,
you know,

1447
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:13,523
I had an old tank which is one of the 
original tanks and it was starting to 

1448
01:03:17,071 --> 01:03:19,110
deteriorate a little bit because I'd had
it for awhile.

1449
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,480
And um,
this guy told me,

1450
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,130
it was like,
this is crazy guy in Venice.

1451
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:24,570
It's making these tanks.
It's just,

1452
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:26,930
they're just so much better than anybody
else's pods.

1453
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,710
Is it?
Or like full square rooms?

1454
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:31,980
I mean get into it.
It looks like a small meat locker.

1455
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,770
That's what it looks like.
You open a door and you climb and he has

1456
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:40,040
a bunch of different models.
You have some that you gotta gotta gotTa

1457
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:40,920
Kinda Bend over when you get in.

1458
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,130
But mine is like seven feet tall and 
like nine feet long.

1459
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,470
It's huge.
I've heard you say that you find it like

1460
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:48,750
incredibly therapeutic and just clear 
your mind,

1461
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,340
take you to places where you can think 
clearly.

1462
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:53,010
I could benefit from some of them.
It's great for that.

1463
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,560
It's great physically for your body to.
I'm like my back,

1464
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:58,650
like opens up and relax.
I feel like I couldn't like pop.

1465
01:03:58,651 --> 01:04:00,250
It just felt like stretching my,
my,

1466
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,410
my shoulders up.
It just goes pop,

1467
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:02,850
pop,
pop.

1468
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:06,750
Because everything's just relaxing.
It's a great source of magnesium because

1469
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:09,630
there's a thousand pounds of epsom salts
in the water.

1470
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:13,710
My older one was like 800 pounds,
but the bigger one requires more so it's

1471
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:16,140
a thousand pounds of salt and that epsom
salt,

1472
01:04:16,141 --> 01:04:17,930
when you're bodies floating in that 
your,

1473
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:22,200
your skin is absorbing the magnesium 
super healthy for you.

1474
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,630
He used to feel great.

1475
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,473
You get out of there,
you feel great and be going like I do 

1476
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:31,290
trip your balls off in there.
I went on mushrooms on New Year's Eve,

1477
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,513
took mushrooms,
so I was cleaning my office and I'm 

1478
01:04:33,751 --> 01:04:35,040
like,
look what I got here,

1479
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:38,610
do I do this?
So I ate the mushrooms and then I didn't

1480
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:39,444
take a big dose,
but I took enough where I started 

1481
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:41,423
getting really weird.
I waited about an hour until I couldn't 

1482
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:45,960
take it anymore.
I was like,

1483
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:47,940
I can't be around people anymore.
I got to get in the tank.

1484
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:52,880
And then I got in the tank and the tank 
was good to you for bracing.

1485
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:56,790
Just to set me on a voyage.
Just sent me an,

1486
01:04:56,791 --> 01:05:00,290
a voyage through my mind and got me in 
this very positive groove.

1487
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:03,960
Do you really like it was,
it was a good trip because it was,

1488
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:05,820
um,
it was a new years eve trip.

1489
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,190
It was like a,
like New Year's Eve bullshit.

1490
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,200
Really the end of the day,
who cares,

1491
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:12,390
you know,
it's just another day,

1492
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:13,051
man.
Like what?

1493
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:13,884
What is in your butt?
Rituals as I'm getting older and more 

1494
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,823
experienced,
I used to reject anything that was 

1495
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:23,200
established because of my life wasn't so
good when I was growing up and I thought

1496
01:05:23,201 --> 01:05:26,400
that everything that was everything that
everybody wanted and everything there,

1497
01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:27,970
but he's working for.
It was all bullshit.

1498
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,720
Degrees are bullshit and rituals are 
bullshit and fuck you.

1499
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:33,940
I'm a rebel.
I know I can appreciate that perspective

1500
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:37,270
should be told.
But as I get older,

1501
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:41,830
I recognized the benefit in like a new 
beginning in your mind,

1502
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,753
like this year I am going to do this.
This year I'm going to like how many 

1503
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:47,134
people.
It's hard for people to actually re 

1504
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:54,010
tweeted something today from Neil 
Strauss who's a really brilliant guy and

1505
01:05:54,101 --> 01:05:54,934
a,
it's an article that he wrote about 

1506
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:59,050
strategies and systems that you can set 
up to,

1507
01:05:59,070 --> 01:05:59,903
uh,
make sure you don't fall into the same 

1508
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:02,680
traps and sabotage yourself.

1509
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:03,760
Cycles.
Yeah.

1510
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:08,790
Which a lot of people do,
but you don't have to be the idea.

1511
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:13,780
There it is right there.
Why you need a Ulyssa strategy for 2016,

1512
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,680
the eye people have this thing in their 
mind that this new,

1513
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:25,690
this new day in this new time is going 
to be the start of their new diet.

1514
01:06:25,691 --> 01:06:28,960
They're going to quit smoking.
They're gonna start exercising.

1515
01:06:28,961 --> 01:06:32,400
They're going to get their life in order
and they go at it with this,

1516
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:36,580
these ernest's intentions,
but very few continue that process.

1517
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:41,700
And the problem being we are creatures 
of habit and we have these comfort zones

1518
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:44,650
and we've sort of set up and when you 
set up those comfort zones,

1519
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:47,460
you set up these established patterns.
It's,

1520
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,110
it's very easy to fall right back into 
them.

1521
01:06:50,111 --> 01:06:50,944
It's very easy to be lazy.
But John Lilly that was studying like 

1522
01:06:53,261 --> 01:06:54,094
the different levels of consciousness 
that he himself said that there are 

1523
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,483
these,
these cycles that you have to try to 

1524
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:01,270
make yourself conscious of and try to 
break these cycles and like,

1525
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:02,903
um,
I know I myself find myself too often 

1526
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,090
sitting in a bathtub feeling a pretty 
down on things and I'm like,

1527
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,193
you know,
maybe if I get out of the fucking 

1528
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,753
bathtub,
go for a jog or so I wouldn't feel like 

1529
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:14,230
this.

1530
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,220
Right.
It definitely would help.

1531
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,090
Going for a jog is one of the best piece
of advice anybody could ever give you.

1532
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,800
Have you ever have something that's 
fucking with you?

1533
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:21,783
Just go for a run.
Get those endorphins flowing and get 

1534
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:25,690
that blood pumping and put things into 
perspective.

1535
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,553
Your mind starts to change immediately.
You actually start the language that 

1536
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:30,940
your,
that your mind beats the shit out of you

1537
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:31,774
with changes and suddenly you start 
getting resolved and answers to your 

1538
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:36,080
problems versus like dwelling on them.
I,

1539
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:36,993
myself personally,
I have gone for runs and I don't run 

1540
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,073
that much but.
And I ride my bike like in in the dark 

1541
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,550
when I'm amidst the darker depths of 
hell.

1542
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:49,660
And every time I come back saying thank 
God you've went and did something right.

1543
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,660
Well,
I think we associate as a human being.

1544
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:53,763
We associate dilemmas and physical 
problems like issues like bills or 

1545
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:01,780
lawsuits.

1546
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,860
In your case.
All these,

1547
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:04,223
we associate those things with a 
physical thing because our bodies are 

1548
01:08:08,261 --> 01:08:13,120
used to any fear or danger from the time
we were monkeys.

1549
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:14,403
It's always been a physical danger.
There's never been like a social issue 

1550
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,013
until recently.
I mean the last few thousand years when 

1551
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:22,670
human beings start talking to each 
other,

1552
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:26,690
the real problems that we had were all.
They weren't fucking bills.

1553
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,540
It's more instinctual almost looks like 
there's a physical problem.

1554
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:30,374
So when you develop stress and anxiety,
you have this physical response to that 

1555
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:35,420
like Holy Shit,
what's going on?

1556
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:39,020
And then you don't do anything with that
physical response.

1557
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:42,080
That physical response never gets fed.
He never run.

1558
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:43,790
You never exercise.
He never exert.

1559
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:44,863
And so your body just gets into a deeper
and deeper level of funk and stress and 

1560
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:49,933
the physical exertion.
All that seems like a meathead thing to 

1561
01:08:51,531 --> 01:08:51,961
say,
look,

1562
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,480
you just got to go to the gym,

1563
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,280
walk it off,
but you really do.

1564
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:59,170
You really do.
And if you do do that,

1565
01:08:59,171 --> 01:09:00,004
you will feel better.
Like some of my favorite people are 

1566
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:04,260
people that do Jujitsu because judges

1567
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:08,610
two is such a life and death struggle on
a regular basis with people you love and

1568
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,230
care about.
It's a bizarre thing,

1569
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,350
like,
you know,

1570
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:12,203
when you roll with people that you love,
like your friends with you slap hands 

1571
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:18,570
and they tried to fucking kill each 
other and you're going to war.

1572
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,460
I mean,
it's exhausting.

1573
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:22,410
So when it's over,
you're drained.

1574
01:09:22,411 --> 01:09:27,300
So other pole shit of regular bullshit 
to seems way less significant.

1575
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,163
You still have to deal with it.
You're still a person who still live in 

1576
01:09:29,731 --> 01:09:31,890
the real world,
still have taxes,

1577
01:09:31,891 --> 01:09:32,724
still a problem,

1578
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,960
still have lawsuits.
Yeah.

1579
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,890
Your situation's very,
very extreme.

1580
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,570
My situation is extreme.
In fact,

1581
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:39,404
if you don't mind,
I wouldn't mind a sort of offering a 

1582
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:42,530
perspective of just how fucked things 
are.

1583
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:43,400
Yeah,
please do.

1584
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,970
So shortly after I was on the podcast,
and I don't know if you recall,

1585
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:48,890
you probably don't,
you see a lot of tweets,

1586
01:09:48,891 --> 01:09:50,930
but I tweeted you,
um,

1587
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:54,800
video of the owner of marine land,
who is the man that's suing myself and a

1588
01:09:54,801 --> 01:09:58,520
number of other people to try to stifle 
our advocacy and essentially punish us.

1589
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,900
And the video was of him driving past 
our home and uh,

1590
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,120
you know,
I upload it to Youtube and whatnot.

1591
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,013
And then shortly thereafter there were 
more videos and then neighbors started 

1592
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:09,674
taking photos when I wasn't home.
So he drives by and just threatened you 

1593
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,670
may slows down.
Well,

1594
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,100
I assume it's to intimidate my 
girlfriend and I,

1595
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:16,963
he has a history of doing this and I 
want to touch a little bit on that in a 

1596
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:21,464
moment,
but I just want to give my example to 

1597
01:10:22,611 --> 01:10:23,444
begin with.

1598
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,780
Give this videos on youtube right now.
Yeah,

1599
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,410
we see it.
Sure.

1600
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:28,480
What's it,
what's your channel?

1601
01:10:28,481 --> 01:10:29,720
I wouldn't mind showing you a couple of 
them,

1602
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:34,840
just google John Holder j o h n h o l e 
r and you'll get videos.

1603
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,633
Footage.
I mean there's a pretty elaborate 

1604
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:38,834
history.
We've unearthed a lot about sort of how 

1605
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:41,240
he,
how he operates.

1606
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:43,450
I'm getting a little nervous talking 
about this jewelry now because I just,

1607
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:46,820
I know the consequences of which are 
going to cost a lot of money and cause a

1608
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:48,860
lot of anxiety where I'm going with this
story.

1609
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:52,070
But when is this fucking lawsuit get 
resolved here?

1610
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:52,933
Here's the video.
We're going to watch the video real 

1611
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:55,710
quick.
So this is you looking out the curtain.

1612
01:10:56,150 --> 01:11:00,410
So I live at the end of a dead end 
street and across from me as the water.

1613
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:01,244
It's a beautiful place.
I love it and he's trying to take from 

1614
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:03,290
me my home essentially.

1615
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,960
But I saw him come by and he stopped in 
front of my house.

1616
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,270
I armed myself with my old blackberry 
camera.

1617
01:11:08,271 --> 01:11:10,220
He went down the road and you see them 
now coming back.

1618
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,083
See speeds up and right here you'll see 
slows right down and he just wants 

1619
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,100
intimidate.
Of course he had no idea that I'm there.

1620
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,980
Of course I present myself and I'm just 
like,

1621
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:21,990
what you want bro?
And then there he goes.

1622
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:24,320
So he drives off.
When you come there,

1623
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,150
he drives off little pussy.
Yeah,

1624
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,073
well that's the same push.
You like to put a lot of bullets in a 

1625
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,940
while.
He'd shot those dogs if you don't recall

1626
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:35,040
my telling you a couple of dogs wandered
off to his property.

1627
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,560
Boom.
Filled him with a shotgun pellets.

1628
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,530
Anyways,
so he pulled.

1629
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,450
Do you know that for sure that that's 
his truck?

1630
01:11:42,451 --> 01:11:43,284
Absolutely.
And in fact we've got them in this new 

1631
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:45,180
vehicle as well as license plate.

1632
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,090
The whole works.
The police in fact set up a surveillance

1633
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:48,960
camera.
Two of them,

1634
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,750
they caught him independently and,
and don't quote me,

1635
01:11:51,751 --> 01:11:52,584
but I'm going to call it 12 times.
The police refused to lay any charges 

1636
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:56,634
because they said a driving past 
someone's home isn't technically is 

1637
01:11:58,980 --> 01:11:59,813
criminal harassment.
Despite the fact that we were like 

1638
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,790
looked at the man suing us.
He's,

1639
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,810
he's dangerous.
I mean,

1640
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:04,860
I,
I knew the man,

1641
01:12:04,861 --> 01:12:07,410
at least historically,
they've had a shotgun in his vehicle.

1642
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,083
He's got a lot of reason to not like my 
myself and my girlfriend who's on any 

1643
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:12,534
given time alone in my home,
so nonetheless the police wouldn't do 

1644
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:16,464
anything.
We took that information and went to a 

1645
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:21,000
justice of the peace to try to lay 
what's called a private,

1646
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,920
a charge,
not a charge,

1647
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:23,754
but we just want him a summons to come 
into the court and explain this 

1648
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:29,100
behavior.
This is normally a 30 day process.

1649
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,060
Marine lands lawyers managed to get in 
an appeal to the summons,

1650
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,130
which is largely unprecedented.
I mean,

1651
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:38,773
I guess with,
I guess people with money can skirt the 

1652
01:12:40,551 --> 01:12:41,384
law,
but nonetheless it took a year and a 

1653
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,240
half.
The lawyer,

1654
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,133
the judge ultimately decided that this 
issue shouldn't be decided in the 

1655
01:12:50,981 --> 01:12:51,910
criminal court.
In fact,

1656
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:53,860
it should be dealt within the civil 
matters.

1657
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,113
So he quashed the summons so the owner 
didn't have to come in and explain 

1658
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:01,840
himself.
And now I'm waiting any given day.

1659
01:13:01,841 --> 01:13:04,930
Now because the lawyers in already 
informed my other lawyers,

1660
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,063
they're seeking a cost,
a motion where I'm to pay the legal 

1661
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:10,174
fees,
which they're claiming upwards of 

1662
01:13:11,111 --> 01:13:12,030
$100,000

1663
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:16,170
to have had to try to get this summons 
against him.

1664
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,770
His stocking leads to my trying to lay a
private,

1665
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:21,630
a charge if you will,
or whatever,

1666
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:22,793
private summons.
He gets it quashed and now he wants to 

1667
01:13:25,171 --> 01:13:26,004
put me on the hook for his legal fees.
So he's just trying to drain you 

1668
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:30,773
financial.
It's a war of attrition and it's like 

1669
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,910
there's just trying to crush anyone 
that's showing any type of opposition.

1670
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:39,810
Now I know the last time you were on you
have like a go fund me or something like

1671
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:41,550
that.
People contributed to how do we,

1672
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,050
how do we help you?
Wow,

1673
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:43,943
what is that address?
And so recently I had to retain a new 

1674
01:13:46,891 --> 01:13:51,180
lawyer to have my lawyers have left and 
these were ultimately the ones that were

1675
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,710
working really at a cost.
Effectively they're gone.

1676
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,090
So I had to retain a new lawyer.

1677
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,420
I don't ask for a lot of money from 
people,

1678
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,313
but I do ask for a lot of people,
as long as we've got money in our 

1679
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:04,704
lawyers can work,
this lawsuit has to run its course and 

1680
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:07,194
at some point,
and the judge has already said it's 

1681
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:11,320
already criticized marine land for 
taking as long as they have now.

1682
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:12,190
Marina wants to say,
well,

1683
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:13,960
this is the behavior of the people of 
the,

1684
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,530
of the defendants,
the behavior being that we tried to seek

1685
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:18,364
some,
some protection from this man that took 

1686
01:14:20,591 --> 01:14:21,940
a year and a half.
He's trying.

1687
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:22,893
The lawyers are trying to allege that 
it's our behavior that delaying this 

1688
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:25,654
process and yet here we are two years 
after I was here and not a single day 

1689
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:29,620
later,
of course,

1690
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,543
a significant legal fees,
but we recently got a very generous 

1691
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,204
contribution from some animal rights 
organizations that are running little 

1692
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,730
fundraisers for us.
Uh,

1693
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,500
we used to have what you would call a 
benefactor,

1694
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:46,480
which was sam simon.
He's cocreator for the simpsons.

1695
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:48,970
He was giving us a lot of money.
Unfortunately recently he passed away.

1696
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:51,840
So that's sorta ended.
But yeah,

1697
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:52,930
largely it's the,
it's the,

1698
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:53,883
it's the public support.
This is really quite unprecedented to 

1699
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:57,570
have a litigation,
uh,

1700
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:00,730
funded by crowdfunding.
It's really unheard of.

1701
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,750
It's an important.

1702
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,520
So what is the address and how do people
get.

1703
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:06,140
We're going to put the address on 
Youtube,

1704
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,940
so if you're listening to this on 
youtube,

1705
01:15:07,941 --> 01:15:08,774
it will be in the description of the 
podcast and I'm also going to put it on 

1706
01:15:13,731 --> 01:15:15,890
twitter and uh,
so we'll,

1707
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:20,330
we'll have it as available as possible.
If we can put it in the itunes,

1708
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,660
a description of the podcast,
we'll put it in that to what is,

1709
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,750
what is the address and how do people 
get to it?

1710
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:26,803
Save smooshy Dotcom.
Smooshy being the walrus that had the 

1711
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,090
anomalous relationship with.
So it's s a,

1712
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:35,300
v e s m o s h I.
okay.

1713
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,580
Dot Com.
So,

1714
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,110
so again,
I'm not funding just my own lawsuit.

1715
01:15:39,111 --> 01:15:41,150
I stuck my neck out and said I'm going 
to pay for all these lawsuits.

1716
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,190
Right.
Because for some years ago,

1717
01:15:43,191 --> 01:15:45,200
and I'd mentioned before that I won wipe
out Canada.

1718
01:15:45,201 --> 01:15:48,080
So there was a period where I actually 
had a good chunk of change in the bank.

1719
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:50,810
So when these lawsuits started to fly,
I just started cutting checks,

1720
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:52,180
just start cutting checks.
Blow.

1721
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:53,460
That didn't last very long.
Right.

1722
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,640
So really it is the support of the 
people.

1723
01:15:55,641 --> 01:15:57,500
But if you don't mind my touching a 
little more.

1724
01:15:57,501 --> 01:15:58,820
Here's the,
here's the page.

1725
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:00,810
Oh cool.
So save smooshy.

1726
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:04,070
That saves smooshy.org.
Go to go to the Dotcom one.

1727
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,300
Yeah.
What's the difference?

1728
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:06,523
The differences.
That was just a website that I had 

1729
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:12,551
created for sort of like ongoing 
fundraising and not exist.

1730
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,390
Safe,
smooth.

1731
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,780
No.
Put it all together in one word.

1732
01:16:14,781 --> 01:16:16,030
They're safe.
Smooshy DOTCOM.

1733
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,650
It did.
It didn't work.

1734
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:19,693
No.
It should.

1735
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:21,380
That motherfucker close down your 
website.

1736
01:16:21,381 --> 01:16:22,390
Yeah.
Oh,

1737
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,040
he's trying to shut down my twitter.
Nevermind it.

1738
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:24,711
Is He.
Okay.

1739
01:16:24,711 --> 01:16:26,660
Here we go.
Save smooshy.com.

1740
01:16:26,661 --> 01:16:29,220
What is it?
It had needed www dot.

1741
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:33,440
Well,
it forwards to a gofund me.

1742
01:16:33,441 --> 01:16:35,710
That's probably why it needed a ww.
Um,

1743
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,333
defend animal abuse whistleblowers.
So right now you've got some donations 

1744
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:44,360
and there's a donate button.
Donate on.

1745
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:48,620
You can share it on facebook and uh,
let's,

1746
01:16:48,621 --> 01:16:49,454
uh,
let's fucking pump this up just to 

1747
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,633
stress that that's in Canadian currency.
Not to scare anyone because a lot of 

1748
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:54,920
people go and just like,
well,

1749
01:16:54,921 --> 01:16:55,754
what's the seat next to the donation?
You guys just stop using your bullshit 

1750
01:16:58,401 --> 01:17:00,050
money and use ours.
Cut it out.

1751
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,011
It'd be nice.
Yeah,

1752
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:02,570
that's for damn sure you're connected to
us.

1753
01:17:02,571 --> 01:17:04,950
Let's cut the shit.
Goddammit.

1754
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:10,040
Mexico to cut the shit with your pesos.
If I can just touch on

1755
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,330
a story that I think it's important in 
the realm of public opinion to,

1756
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:15,223
or rather consciousness to know of,
but this isn't the first time that the 

1757
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:20,120
owner Marineland has stocked and 
intimidated people.

1758
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,100
In fact,
uh,

1759
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,540
some years ago,
uh,

1760
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,593
a woman named Paula Miller was living in
a trailer park that the owner marina 

1761
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:31,430
actually owned that was across the 
street from the park and he had promised

1762
01:17:31,431 --> 01:17:33,220
them all that he was not going to,
to,

1763
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:34,463
to move them or displace them and this 
was going to be their home for a long 

1764
01:17:36,171 --> 01:17:37,280
time.
A lot of retirees there,

1765
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:38,114
people put some permanent investment in,
in their properties while ultimately he 

1766
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:43,570
did elect to kick everyone out.
Uh,

1767
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,290
he had the city support,
which is not,

1768
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,020
again,
we're up against a lot of forces,

1769
01:17:48,021 --> 01:17:49,400
if you will.
Well,

1770
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:52,280
one woman was having none of that.
She was,

1771
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:53,143
she was refusing to move and the owner 
would repeatedly drive by an 

1772
01:17:56,061 --> 01:17:56,894
intimidator.
And ultimately what she did was she had 

1773
01:17:58,311 --> 01:17:59,144
written on the wall,
she'd written John Holder made you get 

1774
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:02,624
exactly what you deserve tenfold.
And then she thereafter committed 

1775
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:07,300
suicide.
Yeah,

1776
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:11,300
I think it's important to tell that 
story.

1777
01:18:11,301 --> 01:18:12,800
I,
it's because,

1778
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:16,910
uh,
it illuminates sort of who he is.

1779
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:18,523
Yes.
Essentially.

1780
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:19,630
Allegedly,
of course,

1781
01:18:19,631 --> 01:18:22,930
to say that,
well,

1782
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:23,830
we're going to help you,
man.

1783
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,713
We're to pump this fucker.
I've said it before and I'll say it 

1784
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:26,171
again,
like,

1785
01:18:26,171 --> 01:18:27,700
we're really still in this game because 
of you

1786
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,960
heartfelt appreciation for having me 
back on.

1787
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:31,823
It's a can't tell you.
And the timing is right because we have 

1788
01:18:34,591 --> 01:18:36,330
a bunch of different motion dates coming
up and.

1789
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:39,780
But I appreciate that,
but I also appreciate what you're doing.

1790
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:43,350
I think that guys like you were super 
important for this.

1791
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,790
You,
you in particular,

1792
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:45,624
you probably one of the most important 
because this whole thing that we're 

1793
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:49,224
experiencing right now is essentially 
our civilization is awakening to the 

1794
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:54,243
horrors of the past and we're doing 
something that's really fucked up and 

1795
01:18:57,481 --> 01:18:59,760
not right and we've been doing it for a 
long time,

1796
01:18:59,761 --> 01:19:00,594
so we think it's okay because we've been
doing it for a long time and this is 

1797
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:06,180
sort of the same thing that they 
experienced with slavery.

1798
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:07,163
I mean,
slavery had existed for a long fucking 

1799
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,660
time and it took a bunch.
I mean,

1800
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,790
people feel like you're exaggerating 
this.

1801
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,880
This is not slavery.
These are animals.

1802
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:17,790
Nope.
They're insanely intelligent animals.

1803
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,670
There are.
They're so much different than a fucking

1804
01:19:20,671 --> 01:19:21,504
puppy.
There's so much different than a 

1805
01:19:22,411 --> 01:19:23,244
squirrel.
They have a cerebral cortex that's 40 

1806
01:19:25,771 --> 01:19:28,770
percent larger than human beings.
We don't know why.

1807
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:29,813
We don't know what they're saying.
We know they have an insanely complex 

1808
01:19:32,941 --> 01:19:35,040
language,
but we don't know what it's.

1809
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:38,370
We don't know what the meaning behind 
the sounds are.

1810
01:19:38,371 --> 01:19:41,250
We don't know.
We've recognized dialects.

1811
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:43,830
They have different dialects in 
different areas.

1812
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,860
We know that they speak differently in 
different parts of the world,

1813
01:19:46,861 --> 01:19:47,590
and I can,

1814
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:48,423
I can personally offer perspective of 
having had a really strong relationship 

1815
01:19:51,011 --> 01:19:51,844
with an animal,
like my anomalous relationship with 

1816
01:19:52,841 --> 01:19:53,680
smooshy,
the Walrus,

1817
01:19:53,681 --> 01:19:54,870
and I'll just do a quick,
uh,

1818
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:59,290
summary of it is that she at one point 
believed that I was her mother.

1819
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,041
I mean,
she still does.

1820
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:02,090
It's an eight now.
She thinks that I'm her mother.

1821
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,820
It's tattooed on her brain,
right?

1822
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:05,780
I've imprinted on her,
uh,

1823
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,633
so I got to appreciate what it was like 
to raise this animal in that unique 

1824
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:11,784
opportunity and in that the language.
And I wish Jonsi lily would still be 

1825
01:20:14,491 --> 01:20:15,324
around because I think that he himself 
will be calling a lot of bullshit on 

1826
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:17,611
what's going on.
He'd say,

1827
01:20:17,611 --> 01:20:20,510
this is a fucking catastrophe that 
during your,

1828
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:22,920
your what's being imposed on us,
the separation,

1829
01:20:22,921 --> 01:20:23,754
everything else.
But I got to learn what it was like to 

1830
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,720
teach an animal,
to have a sense of humor.

1831
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:28,553
For instance.
I mean,

1832
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,680
this Walrus has a sense of humor.
This walrus knows me intimately.

1833
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:33,780
Whether I raise my voice or I lower it,
she has,

1834
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:36,840
she knows me in the,
in a second dog.

1835
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,780
Now I'm going to say,
I'm going to say for outside,

1836
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,543
this is an animal that could appreciate 
when there was real threat against me 

1837
01:20:44,921 --> 01:20:45,754
and we used to joke around that and the 
way that we discovered that she was so 

1838
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:48,750
protective of me that people come really
close to me.

1839
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,130
She would beat the snot out of these 
people.

1840
01:20:50,131 --> 01:20:52,890
I mean she'd come into like a 200 pound 
bowling ball and displace you,

1841
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:53,933
but she knew when I was messing with 
someone or when someone had grabbed me 

1842
01:20:56,401 --> 01:20:57,810
and it appeared to be a little more 
violent.

1843
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,673
It was mean.
Her reaction is someone grabs you in a 

1844
01:20:59,971 --> 01:21:02,070
violent way.
The owner's son in fact.

1845
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:03,210
And uh,
yeah,

1846
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,793
the owner's son came over one time.
He just didn't believe what was going 

1847
01:21:06,781 --> 01:21:07,614
on.
And he grabbed me and he didn't grab me 

1848
01:21:08,311 --> 01:21:10,140
in a smooth and fun way.
He grabbed me and shook me.

1849
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,290
Smooshy never forgot his face.
A she'd fucking shoes.

1850
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,433
There was a gap between associate 
smashed up against those bars really 

1851
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:18,210
aggressively harping on him,
the yellow and everything else,

1852
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:20,940
and even in the weeks and months to 
come,

1853
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,660
every time he'd come any,
any even remotely close to me are in the

1854
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:25,980
room.
She was ready to pounce.

1855
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:29,850
It was amazing.
How fast is a walrus pounds.

1856
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:30,743
They can you call it pouncing?
I wouldn't call it that kind of waddle 

1857
01:21:32,941 --> 01:21:34,350
right there.
Pretty fast.

1858
01:21:34,351 --> 01:21:36,270
There are a heavy animal.
Actually I can say that I've,

1859
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:37,980
I've,
and not just myself,

1860
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:38,843
another other former trainers have 
actually rescued the owner of marine 

1861
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:42,430
land from,
uh,

1862
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,300
from Walter says that we're,
that we're about to attack them.

1863
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,580
There's a video on youtube,
which is actually hilarious,

1864
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:48,773
where,
uh,

1865
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,613
he's out on stage,
obviously yelling at a trainer to bring 

1866
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:53,340
out more animals.
Everything in a Walrus,

1867
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:56,470
breaks from them and starts going 
towards the owner and he's turns around,

1868
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,333
starts booking and the walrus stops and 
he turns around and grabs his water and 

1869
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,120
froze the water.
And then the wall was,

1870
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:04,320
goes and he sort of tucks away behind 
this sort of safety door.

1871
01:22:04,321 --> 01:22:05,790
And I'm just like,
what a con.

1872
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,470
I couldn't wait for him to get knocked 
down,

1873
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:08,670
man.
It didn't happen.

1874
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:09,563
Whatever.
But there was a number of examples of 

1875
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:12,451
that.
Actually,

1876
01:22:12,451 --> 01:22:13,800
there's another video,
if you don't mind,

1877
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,673
um,
look up.

1878
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,043
If you Google John Holder again,
you can get to a place where he's 

1879
01:22:18,211 --> 01:22:22,140
actually a confronting a,
an activist who's just,

1880
01:22:22,141 --> 01:22:22,974
they're offering on public property,
which has now since been leased to the 

1881
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:27,570
two marine land by the city.

1882
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:28,963
Um,
he's handing leaflets with information 

1883
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:32,660
while they have a,
they have a conflict.

1884
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:35,250
They have sort of a coming together and 
uh,

1885
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:39,060
John Holder in plain English threatens 
to stab him and bury him.

1886
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:40,590
And of course,
the activist,

1887
01:22:40,591 --> 01:22:42,330
who's Mike Garrett,
he's a fantastic guy.

1888
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:43,630
Uh,
was um,

1889
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,291
was,
you know,

1890
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:46,510
he's like,
I'm assuming he saw us.

1891
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:49,410
He tried to keep,
keep some sense and keep things as light

1892
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:51,810
as possible.
But John just has a conniption.

1893
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:53,520
He's yell and his arms and up.
I mean,

1894
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,740
John's a little guy,
right?

1895
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,030
He's got what I call it,
a little big man where he's just.

1896
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,313
But anyways,
he goes all because the guy is 

1897
01:22:59,911 --> 01:23:02,490
protesting against what we use the word 
protesting,

1898
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:04,530
but more than anything he's handing 
information.

1899
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:05,364
He's handing a history of marine landed,
but it happens to be at the end of the 

1900
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:09,370
park on public property.
But nonetheless,

1901
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:10,720
you know,
uh,

1902
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:15,340
the city obliged and leased the land to 
them.

1903
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:16,840
I mean,
it is what it is.

1904
01:23:16,841 --> 01:23:20,650
Greenland's operated for 53 years.
I'm above the law.

1905
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,970
There was no loss.
There was nothing.

1906
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,020
Now there are some.
Thankfully things are,

1907
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,370
are turning slowly.
But if you could find that video,

1908
01:23:27,371 --> 01:23:28,450
if not,
that's all right Joe,

1909
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,640
while I've got a while,
we're just here,

1910
01:23:30,641 --> 01:23:31,960
I'd like to show you this.
Oh yeah,

1911
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:32,794
let's,
let's take a look.

1912
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:34,870
So here he's like,
oh look,

1913
01:23:34,871 --> 01:23:35,830
we're hugging.
And then here

1914
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:39,350
that little guys,
the little guys,

1915
01:23:39,351 --> 01:23:41,240
the owner,
and that's his hired gun on the uh,

1916
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:43,290
right.
They're all it is,

1917
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:48,130
is information.
That's all public property.

1918
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:53,750
All we doing is asking.
People don't have to take it.

1919
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:01,080
Whale,
whale and Nadia.

1920
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:03,460
It's called me a whale earlier.
Let's stick with the program.

1921
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:06,520
I can see John getting a little furious 
here.

1922
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:09,610
Thankfully.
Thank God John doesn't have a knife.

1923
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,440
You all see very me right here as you 
said.

1924
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,470
When did he say that though?

1925
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:15,830
You said it earlier in the video.
Oh,

1926
01:24:15,831 --> 01:24:17,600
let me hear the beginning where you said
him.

1927
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,070
This is the closest I've ever been in my
life.

1928
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:24,950
Like literally I come on,
he's just doing his job.

1929
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:25,900
You're lucky.
I know.

1930
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:29,470
I'm lucky you don't have a knife so you 
would stab me if you had a knife.

1931
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:32,420
Oh,
you kill me right here.

1932
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:34,683
You would bury me right here.
You wouldn't even bother to look into 

1933
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:38,750
mass graves.
Come on up folks.

1934
01:24:38,751 --> 01:24:41,270
It's just information.
That's all it is.

1935
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,980
Just information.
John doesn't want to stab me and

1936
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,280
great guy.
Mike's a great guy.

1937
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,500
I've tried to support him as well.
He's being sued.

1938
01:24:50,501 --> 01:24:54,250
Of course.
He's actually having his wages garnished

1939
01:24:54,251 --> 01:24:55,084
because marine land,
what they do is they use these lawsuits 

1940
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:58,120
and then they propose all these 
different motions,

1941
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,390
so it's sort of a function inside the 
lawsuit.

1942
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:02,463
Well,
what happens is during these motions is 

1943
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,460
it can go either way,
right?

1944
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,270
A lawyer can,
can win a motion against another lawyer,

1945
01:25:07,271 --> 01:25:08,104
whether it be a bullshit lawsuit or not,
but what happens is in that process it 

1946
01:25:10,691 --> 01:25:13,270
becomes a cost award.
So unfortunate for Mike,

1947
01:25:13,271 --> 01:25:16,390
he got a cost order against him and he 
couldn't afford whatever the price was.

1948
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:17,224
Of course,
Marineland we'll say an inflated price 

1949
01:25:18,371 --> 01:25:19,204
prices.
All this costs $25,000 to have to bring 

1950
01:25:20,711 --> 01:25:23,080
him in here.
And so the judge awarded $10,000.

1951
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:25,210
So Mike's happens,
his wages garnished.

1952
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:27,070
Now this is not a man who broke the law.

1953
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,300
This is a man who opposed,
uh,

1954
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:31,740
the policies and the,
and the practices of marine land.

1955
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:34,600
This is because of this right here.
Because of that,

1956
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:35,434
right there.
So he's having his wages garnished to 

1957
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:37,804
the tune of how much,
I think he said 30 percent a month for 

1958
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:44,110
how long or how much per paycheck?
He still knows quite a bit of money.

1959
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:47,190
How much does he think he owes in the 
arrange of six or 7,000 at this point.

1960
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:48,930
And he just lost his lawyer.
We,

1961
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,250
we actually had the similar lawyers.
He's,

1962
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:52,180
he's looking for a lawyer.
So this is a public plea,

1963
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:53,014
if there are any lawyers in Canada,
they're looking to make a name for 

1964
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:57,640
themselves and help our ourselves or 
Mike Garrett like,

1965
01:25:57,641 --> 01:25:58,660
yes,
please get involved.

1966
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,490
And if you do help,
I'll tweet it out.

1967
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:02,890
If you do help,
I'll put it up online and I'll.

1968
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:03,980
People know that you're doing

1969
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,030
a good thing.
Joe,

1970
01:26:05,031 --> 01:26:05,864
while you're here,
I just want you to take a look at this 

1971
01:26:07,881 --> 01:26:10,010
print we've had made.
This is from a,

1972
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:10,844
a.
it's just an absolute sick graffiti 

1973
01:26:12,051 --> 01:26:16,550
artists named Walk Brooklyn.
Save smooshy marine land.

1974
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:17,413
Does that,
that teacher and this teacher that I'm 

1975
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:19,550
giving to me.
So I'll hold it up.

1976
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,090
Yeah.
This is a courtesy.

1977
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:23,700
Lofty Towers is a place in Niagara Falls
that,

1978
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,410
that,
uh,

1979
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:26,030
generously printed it for us.
And then of course,

1980
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,950
each one you've got to see this guy's 
work.

1981
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:29,990
It's fantastic.
And it's basically,

1982
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:31,820
if you look at it,
you've got the wall,

1983
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:32,893
you've got the Walrus.
Smooshy is basically giving the finger 

1984
01:26:34,551 --> 01:26:37,880
to what appears to be an old man who's 
with a shirt that says,

1985
01:26:37,881 --> 01:26:40,550
bury me with my money,
who's got some shackles around it?

1986
01:26:40,551 --> 01:26:41,384
And it says,
it sort of looks like it says fuck 

1987
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:43,790
marine land on the bottom.

1988
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:45,710
I don't know if it actually does,
but um,

1989
01:26:45,711 --> 01:26:47,960
so that's the old dude supposedly.
I don't think.

1990
01:26:47,961 --> 01:26:48,780
I Dunno.
I have no idea.

1991
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,560
Listen,
look like I'm good.

1992
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,800
Totally not him.
No,

1993
01:26:51,801 --> 01:26:53,320
not.
Can't possibly be halfly.

1994
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,000
Not Slave,
but there's a nice shirt for you to wear

1995
01:26:56,001 --> 01:26:58,270
it when you're doing some gardening or 
raising your chickens in the back,

1996
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,970
then I'll use that for sure.
It's much.

1997
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,670
It's.
I hate hearing stories like that.

1998
01:27:04,671 --> 01:27:05,504
I hate hearing.
I hate hearing what's ultimately human 

1999
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:12,980
failure.
That's like a civilization failure,

2000
01:27:12,981 --> 01:27:15,290
societal,
cultural failure.

2001
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:19,430
This,
this old creepy fuck that's getting away

2002
01:27:19,431 --> 01:27:19,941
with.
I mean,

2003
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:20,774
you could just tell them that video is 
disgusting and this whole thing is 

2004
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:26,870
disgusting.
Guy Wants to continue his slave business

2005
01:27:26,871 --> 01:27:27,704
and he's,
he's out there themselves getting his 

2006
01:27:29,241 --> 01:27:30,074
own fucking hands dirty.
It's worth more money than I can even 

2007
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:34,243
conceive.
And yet all he wants is the power we 

2008
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:38,250
hold to like if I was worth that much 
money.

2009
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:40,250
Does he have a wife?
He has a wonderful wife,

2010
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:40,820
in fact.
Yes.

2011
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:41,541
Wonderful.
Yeah,

2012
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:42,374
she's a,
she's a,

2013
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:47,500
she's a very nice going to say if I,
if I didn't Costa Rica about hookers and

2014
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:50,220
coke until the heart stops.
He likes the hunt.

2015
01:27:50,221 --> 01:27:51,680
You'd think he'd just be able to hunt 
steady,

2016
01:27:51,681 --> 01:27:53,210
like just go do the thing that you liked
the most,

2017
01:27:53,211 --> 01:27:55,860
but what he likes the most,
what appears to be is to be a tire.

2018
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:56,773
You know,
I watched that episode of you and Lance 

2019
01:27:58,710 --> 01:27:59,690
Armstrong and I thought it was really 
great.

2020
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,430
It really humanize the situation he was 
in.

2021
01:28:01,431 --> 01:28:03,800
But the thing,
the thing that he expressed the most,

2022
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,200
uh,
the regret was when he ultimately was a,

2023
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:10,280
was a,
I forget the word he used,

2024
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:13,010
but like get throwing all these lawsuits
against.

2025
01:28:13,011 --> 01:28:13,844
Yeah,
he fucked up.

2026
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:16,400
He fucked up that,
that was a fuck up.

2027
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:19,240
But that was,
that would be 100 percent supportive.

2028
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,600
Um,
that's the,

2029
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:23,010
I mean cause you know,
it's like if you ever seen the bill burr

2030
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:25,640
bit where he's on Conan or we talked 
about it until it happens.

2031
01:28:25,641 --> 01:28:27,890
But I am learning about bill burr now.
Actually.

2032
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,113
I find his comedy amazing.
It's one of the best ever that do show 

2033
01:28:31,731 --> 01:28:35,160
that he's got half is so great.
I watched an episode the other night was

2034
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:37,100
really good.
It's on Netflix folks.

2035
01:28:37,101 --> 01:28:37,934
If you want to watch it.
It's an animated series called F is for 

2036
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:41,540
family and he's just a great guy.
He's just,

2037
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:44,330
he's the real deal.
Bill Burr is the real deal.

2038
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:47,290
He's just one of the best guys ever.
And um,

2039
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,660
he had this amazing bit about Lance 
Armstrong being that like,

2040
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:52,810
you know,
basically his,

2041
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:55,580
his words are psychopath beat.
You're a psychopath,

2042
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:57,410
like the whole fucking sports on 
steroids.

2043
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:59,180
They're all on drugs.
And it's true.

2044
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:00,103
He became the face.
Unfortunately he was pegged being the 

2045
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:04,500
guy and I mean he had all the accolades.
He had the image.

2046
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:05,880
So it.
And which also means you had the most to

2047
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:07,770
lose.
But the thing that he expressed most was

2048
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:11,040
he regretted on people's lives.
I mean,

2049
01:29:11,041 --> 01:29:13,680
he was trying to keep this whole thing 
going.

2050
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,890
This guy,
what he's doing is just normal.

2051
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:18,540
It's what people do.
You know,

2052
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:21,510
when power,
when people have established power,

2053
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:24,900
they try to protect it.
He recognizes all the benefits that he's

2054
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:28,800
had for that power and he doesn't want 
to step down and relinquish it.

2055
01:29:28,801 --> 01:29:29,634
And also if he did,
he would have to somehow or another 

2056
01:29:31,381 --> 01:29:32,214
admit that what he was doing was wrong.
And I assumed that marine land is still 

2057
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:35,980
making money.
Uh,

2058
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,590
it still makes some money out a little 
bit,

2059
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,340
is it?

2060
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,210
The balance is down significantly 
because tourism is up in Niagara Falls.

2061
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:45,180
But I think if you guys really want to 
get a,

2062
01:29:45,181 --> 01:29:46,680
a,
a good perspective.

2063
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:50,310
There was a podcast that I was recently 
on called Canada land and it's a,

2064
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:53,700
it's a big podcast hosted by an 
investigative journalist,

2065
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,633
a Jesse Brown,
and he's very meticulous and very 

2066
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:56,840
thorough in his,
uh,

2067
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,530
in his work.
And he had,

2068
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:02,130
and he detailed this exchange between he
and marine marketing.

2069
01:30:02,131 --> 01:30:04,230
No one put a name on it.
It's got to be marine lines.

2070
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:05,130
Lawyers,
I don't know.

2071
01:30:05,131 --> 01:30:05,964
But nonetheless,
if you want to see how they operate and 

2072
01:30:07,771 --> 01:30:08,604
how far they're willing to go to 
suppress what I say and the information 

2073
01:30:12,061 --> 01:30:12,894
that we provide,
do go to the candle and podcasts and 

2074
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:15,900
check it out.
Um,

2075
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:17,223
they've threatened to sue him,
they vowed to suit to what they called 

2076
01:30:19,551 --> 01:30:20,520
judgment,
and that's a quote.

2077
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:23,430
Um,
but that's just the way they operate.

2078
01:30:23,431 --> 01:30:24,270
If you,
I mean,

2079
01:30:24,271 --> 01:30:25,051
you yourself,
Joe,

2080
01:30:25,051 --> 01:30:25,884
and I hate to say it,
but it would be a dream if they 

2081
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,470
threatened to sue you.
It's not going to happen,

2082
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:31,650
but why would they sue me?
First of all,

2083
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:34,140
I'm a fucking American.
You can't sue me.

2084
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,140
The goofy kangaroo court.
He's a Dick.

2085
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,033
He's suing Americans right now.
I'm trying to threaten them with that 

2086
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:43,200
and I'll drive by his house at Fuck,
how about that?

2087
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,290
I'll just say nice things to him.
I want him to threaten him.

2088
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:49,980
Yeah.
That Canada land podcast details at all.

2089
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,600
It was well,
it was really well done.

2090
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:57,080
I just think the whole thing eventually,
when you look at it historically,

2091
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:58,403
I think,
um,

2092
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,580
my friend Amber Lyon had a great quote 
when she was talking about when she used

2093
01:31:02,581 --> 01:31:04,630
to work for CNN.
Um,

2094
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:06,600
it's,
I love this quote.

2095
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:08,850
It's being on the wrong side of history.
Yeah,

2096
01:31:08,851 --> 01:31:10,500
exactly.
And that's what this guy is.

2097
01:31:10,501 --> 01:31:11,930
He's on the wrong side of history.
Yet,

2098
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:13,043
when it all boils down,
you're going to look like an ugly 

2099
01:31:15,181 --> 01:31:16,270
monster.
Yeah.

2100
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:18,570
I don't know what he's trying to.
What type of legacy is trying to protect

2101
01:31:18,571 --> 01:31:19,404
at this point in?
The funny thing is all of these make it 

2102
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,750
lawyers rich.
It's not making me broke.

2103
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:22,530
It's not working.
I mean,

2104
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:24,990
to a certain extent that doing old rich 
fucks.

2105
01:31:24,991 --> 01:31:27,150
Do they sue you?
You know?

2106
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:31,200
I mean,
that's common practice they have.

2107
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:33,810
That's their avenue of getting back at 
you for talking.

2108
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:34,913
He exists in a different world.
He is an old man and he's born in a 

2109
01:31:38,581 --> 01:31:39,414
world where there was no internet and 
he's experiencing the ramifications of 

2110
01:31:43,861 --> 01:31:44,694
this time that we're in and also the new
information that exists now where we 

2111
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:48,654
understand that these practices they've 
been engaging in for decades are cruel 

2112
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:56,220
and inhumane and disgusting.
They're disgusting.

2113
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,290
There's no other way to say it.
Yeah.

2114
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,130
Captivity of

2115
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:01,950
mammals like that.
It's fucking disgust.

2116
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:05,400
I indeed.
Where's it going to go,

2117
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:06,243
man?
Like what?

2118
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:08,770
How long can this guy keep dragging you 
around the courts?

2119
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:10,413
Well,
unfortunately there was some changes to 

2120
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,480
the law societies laws and where it used
to be,

2121
01:32:16,481 --> 01:32:18,760
I believe three years of inactivity and 
the lawsuit you can,

2122
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:20,440
you can file a motion to have it thrown 
out.

2123
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,700
That's been extended as I think it was 
march of last year to five years,

2124
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:27,010
so we've got a lot of things going 
against us.

2125
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:30,730
So you have two more years of inactivity
before they could sue you.

2126
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:31,481
I,
I mean,

2127
01:32:31,481 --> 01:32:32,500
I don't know.
I'm not a lawyer,

2128
01:32:32,501 --> 01:32:33,334
but this is my understanding of what was
an opportunity before that is no longer 

2129
01:32:35,891 --> 01:32:39,230
there,
but the idea is at some point he,

2130
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:41,710
he himself has to play by the rules of 
the courts.

2131
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,120
He's going to have to be examined.

2132
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,770
He's the one that's got the information 
that we want.

2133
01:32:44,771 --> 01:32:45,604
We want to go get that information.
This is information that marine land is 

2134
01:32:48,221 --> 01:32:51,610
steadfast right now and isolating or 
other insulating any type of,

2135
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:52,450
of,
uh,

2136
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:53,650
of,
of witnesses.

2137
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:54,663
I mean he himself as a witness to all of
the things that he's alleging against 

2138
01:32:56,741 --> 01:32:59,710
that he should be the one that is 
responding to the lawsuit instead.

2139
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,060
They give us this,
uh,

2140
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:01,811
this,
uh,

2141
01:33:01,811 --> 01:33:03,460
this glorified janitor.
Well,

2142
01:33:03,461 --> 01:33:05,680
what the fuck does this janitor have to 
do with our lawsuit?

2143
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:09,160
We want to look at your financial files.
You're claiming financial losses,

2144
01:33:09,161 --> 01:33:09,431
uh,
in,

2145
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:09,780
uh,
in,

2146
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:12,340
in the region of what's the janitor?
What are you talking about?

2147
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:15,400
So what marine land doesn't listen.
This shouldn't surprise anyone is rather

2148
01:33:15,401 --> 01:33:16,091
than be like,
okay,

2149
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:16,924
look,
I'm suing you so you can take a look at 

2150
01:33:18,971 --> 01:33:20,710
my files.
I'm going to present to you that the net

2151
01:33:20,711 --> 01:33:23,050
losses,
financial losses of that I'm claiming,

2152
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:25,270
and then you're going to have to defend 
against this information.

2153
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:26,340
Well,
instead they,

2154
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:28,000
they gave me this,
this janitor.

2155
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:28,834
Well,
what the hell,

2156
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:30,750
what the hell has that got to do with 
anything we don't want to,

2157
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,690
we don't want it gave you a janitor for 
what?

2158
01:33:32,691 --> 01:33:34,540
Like to look through his that he's 
gonna.

2159
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,500
Give us the files apparently that we're 
looking at.

2160
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:40,240
That is going to give context to the 
lawsuit.

2161
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:41,133
It's nonsense Joe.
It's just another means that I have to 

2162
01:33:42,671 --> 01:33:45,580
fight and spend a lot of money to try to
get to the,

2163
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:46,930
to,
to the root of it all,

2164
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:50,290
which is the legitimacy of the lawsuit,
which there is none.

2165
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:53,410
I'm being sued for plotting to steal a 
walrus.

2166
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:54,873
That's what it's all about.
My last wanting to steal smooshy my 

2167
01:33:57,551 --> 01:34:01,330
lawsuit is plotting to steal smooshy.
My girlfriend's lawsuit is defamation in

2168
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:05,020
the sense that she expressed concern for
the lone remaining killer whale Kiska,

2169
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:09,760
which was bleeding profusely from her 
tail and hurt her or talk with the,

2170
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:11,680
with the Toronto Sun or rather the 
Toronto Star,

2171
01:34:11,681 --> 01:34:14,380
which is the newspaper that revealed all
the,

2172
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:16,720
sort of did the investigation of marine 
land.

2173
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:19,330
So she's being sued and they had a video
and then the video,

2174
01:34:19,331 --> 01:34:20,980
you see the killer whale bleeding like 
crazy.

2175
01:34:20,981 --> 01:34:22,390
I don't know how you can call that 
defamation.

2176
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:24,290
And then there's another lawsuit called,
uh,

2177
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:27,160
that's a,
that's going against Jim Hammond.

2178
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:27,994
He's a former land animal care 
supervisor and he's the one that 

2179
01:34:29,651 --> 01:34:34,651
witnessed John holders shoot the dogs on
his property for no reason.

2180
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:36,340
I mean,
that can't be defended.

2181
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:37,600
It's indefensible.
These were,

2182
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:38,463
these were golden labs.
These are puppy dogs and coyotes and 

2183
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,733
these were his neighbors and the 
neighbors were afraid to press charges 

2184
01:34:44,561 --> 01:34:46,780
because they thought that John would sue
them.

2185
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:47,800
They probably thought,
right.

2186
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:48,753
I mean the police themselves said to me,
we can't lay this charge on him because 

2187
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:52,960
he's going to lawyer us.
He's gonna.

2188
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,450
He's gonna lawyer up.
Oh God.

2189
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,260
Yeah.
It's really a stone wall.

2190
01:34:56,261 --> 01:34:58,670
They're putting up,
so he just gets is just strategy.

2191
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:00,750
He just sues a war of attrition.
He's got a suit.

2192
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:01,733
Everyone and what?
I don't understand how the courts are 

2193
01:35:03,741 --> 01:35:06,770
allowing him to sue for this.
This doesn't make any sense because it.

2194
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:10,190
Because we've gotten nowhere in terms of
trying to prove the legitimacy of it.

2195
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:13,310
It's just the process itself in and of 
itself is,

2196
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:15,860
is,
is punishing to people like me.

2197
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:18,380
So his idea is not,
let's go to court.

2198
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,273
It's let's put him through the ringer so
that he goes broke and ultimately the 

2199
01:35:22,521 --> 01:35:24,620
only way I can get out of this lawsuit 
was if I signed something,

2200
01:35:24,621 --> 01:35:26,690
say I'm not going to talk anymore.
Well fuck that.

2201
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:29,450
I'm not going to not talk,
I'm going to continue to talk to talk.

2202
01:35:29,451 --> 01:35:30,284
I'm going to continue to get my ass on 
these podcasts and spread my word and I 

2203
01:35:32,931 --> 01:35:34,160
get a louder and louder voice.

2204
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,780
I mean that's my.
That's my resolve.

2205
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,470
So you think ultimately this has to 
somehow or another come to a trial?

2206
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:40,363
It absolutely has to.
Or he has to drop the charges and then 

2207
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,230
he would have to get him.
I am suing him.

2208
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:46,213
He's yet to respond to it.
This is something again that normally 

2209
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,823
lawsuits have 30 days.
This has been three years and they've 

2210
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:51,980
not responded well,
how's that work?

2211
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:54,920
That how come you have to respond?
But he doesn't have to respond.

2212
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,290
They've.
What they've done is essentially,

2213
01:35:57,291 --> 01:35:58,124
or what I believe they've done allegedly
is they've hijacked the process is what 

2214
01:36:02,481 --> 01:36:03,314
it's called,
where you just inundate the courts with 

2215
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:08,330
a bunch of different things and every 
time a court date seems to come up,

2216
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:11,360
it gets adjourned or we do.
In fact,

2217
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:12,303
I mean recently I lost my lawyer.
He's moved away so I was having to find 

2218
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:15,140
another one.

2219
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,570
Marina and pounced immediately called 
for a motion.

2220
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:18,740
All of a sudden,
okay,

2221
01:36:18,741 --> 01:36:19,574
so now I'm defending or rather it 
happened to my girlfriend and she got a 

2222
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,313
had to go in,
but my court date ultimately did get a 

2223
01:36:25,251 --> 01:36:26,084
journal because my girlfriend was 
successful and actually having the 

2224
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:31,670
motion to adjourn despite the fact that 
they're continuing with these motions.

2225
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:33,440
It's hard to explain.
I'm not a lawyer.

2226
01:36:33,441 --> 01:36:35,210
I can't really get down to the nitty 
gritty of it all.

2227
01:36:35,211 --> 01:36:36,044
I can only just offer you the 
perspective of someone who's being 

2228
01:36:37,461 --> 01:36:40,010
punished unjustly with,
with a,

2229
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:45,300
with a process that just in an is 
inherently a abusive.

2230
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:50,300
It's an abuse of process.
It's really discouraging it.

2231
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:51,260
Welcome to my world,
man,

2232
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,960
and I'm still trying to put food on the 
table.

2233
01:36:53,961 --> 01:36:55,370
I mean actually got a life to try to 
live.

2234
01:36:55,371 --> 01:36:59,000
I mean here I was 30,
35 when when this thing happened,

2235
01:36:59,060 --> 01:36:59,990
I'm 38 years old.

2236
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:00,823
I'm going to sweat so I get to look 
forward to resetting my life and try to 

2237
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,210
pursue some personal endeavors.
At what 45 is that?

2238
01:37:05,211 --> 01:37:06,044
When is that?
When I finally get to be freed of this 

2239
01:37:07,101 --> 01:37:08,270
thing,
I mean I'm an activist.

2240
01:37:08,271 --> 01:37:08,781
Yes.
Okay.

2241
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,180
Call me an activist,
but you know,

2242
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:11,023
when this is all said and done,
I'm also a human being that wants to do 

2243
01:37:12,741 --> 01:37:15,020
stuff in life.
What are you doing for work these days?

2244
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:16,490
Um,
I do some.

2245
01:37:16,510 --> 01:37:19,940
Uh,
actually recently I was a pallbearer for

2246
01:37:19,941 --> 01:37:21,050
hire.
That was interesting.

2247
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,660
A lot of people don't have families,
so I'd get a call and say,

2248
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:28,560
you want to come help carry this casket?
Christ carrying dead that,

2249
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,380
that'd be great for the book.
That's another thing.

2250
01:37:30,381 --> 01:37:32,130
That's the problem in the book.
Oh,

2251
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:32,811
absolutely.
Yeah.

2252
01:37:32,811 --> 01:37:33,830
That's a problem.
Well,

2253
01:37:33,831 --> 01:37:36,020
it's a problem because getting a 
publisher's tough right now.

2254
01:37:36,021 --> 01:37:38,330
I mean,
if you're going to publish my words,

2255
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,980
you're going to be sued.
You know?

2256
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:44,210
I assume there was a documentary that 
was in its initial stages.

2257
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:45,133
It is gone.
There was a big story in outside 

2258
01:37:47,631 --> 01:37:49,250
magazine that was coming out.
This was,

2259
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,410
this was the feature piece.
It got quashed.

2260
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:53,930
A lot of people show fear when it comes 
to lawsuits.

2261
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,010
Thankfully Ontario passed what's called

2262
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,930
anti slap legislation.
We got the thing,

2263
01:37:57,931 --> 01:38:00,090
and I'd mentioned this in the earlier 
podcast,

2264
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:03,090
we were getting anti slap legislation.
The problem is,

2265
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:04,530
and there's a major conflict of 
interest,

2266
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:05,543
is that Ontario's premier,
she herself had a slap suit against one 

2267
01:38:09,601 --> 01:38:10,434
of the,
uh,

2268
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:12,540
uh,
mpps during the elections.

2269
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:13,463
She launched the lawsuit so that they 
couldn't talk about this controversial 

2270
01:38:15,331 --> 01:38:16,164
issue which was this gas plant scandal.
And so what she did when she 

2271
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:21,540
reintroduced the bill is that she took 
out the retro clause.

2272
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,910
This was our home run dude.
We were out,

2273
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:24,773
not only that,
marina was going to be up against a 

2274
01:38:25,741 --> 01:38:28,200
major punitive damages,
like as per the letter of the law,

2275
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,770
they took out it being retro.
It's no longer retroactive.

2276
01:38:31,771 --> 01:38:35,310
It doesn't apply to us.
It's insanity because this one woman,

2277
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,310
while she's the premier of Ontario,
fuck her,

2278
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:39,420
I can't say that.

2279
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:42,300
That's not going to help me.
What's her name and appreciated Kathleen

2280
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:42,811
Wynne.
Fuck you,

2281
01:38:42,811 --> 01:38:44,670
Kathleen,
dare you.

2282
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:49,290
I dare you remember I didn't say that.
How dare you felt if I didn't say it?

2283
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,120
God Damn it.
It's cruel,

2284
01:38:51,121 --> 01:38:51,954
man.
That what I've come to learn and 

2285
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,753
involving yourself in any type of 
government process and everything else 

2286
01:38:55,801 --> 01:38:56,634
is that it's a thankless work.
It's fucking brutal and it rarely to 

2287
01:39:00,361 --> 01:39:02,340
ever actually goes your way.
I swear to you,

2288
01:39:02,341 --> 01:39:06,570
I've had an arrow striking the bull's 
eye and every time it just glances every

2289
01:39:06,571 --> 01:39:08,430
fucking time,
but I'm not discouraged.

2290
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,690
Look,
I'm on this fucking show,

2291
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:10,680
man.
It's a dream come true.

2292
01:39:10,681 --> 01:39:12,470
It happened again.
I cannot fuck a believer,

2293
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:15,600
so a good things to come.
I just gotTa keep focused.

2294
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:16,463
Good things to come.
It's just so bizarre that no one from 

2295
01:39:18,931 --> 01:39:23,931
the government recognizes what a 
horrible thing this is not just in terms

2296
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:24,834
of the injustice that is being done,
but also in terms of the pr for their 

2297
01:39:28,201 --> 01:39:29,130
legal system.

2298
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:30,480
It is recognized.
It's large.

2299
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:35,070
It's been expressed in a at Queen's Park
and provincial legislation.

2300
01:39:35,110 --> 01:39:37,460
These are abusive lawsuits and like we 
had a,

2301
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:39,570
an MPP standup,
Sherry Denovo and she's just like,

2302
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:40,583
when is this gonna stop?
I mean she's pounding her fist and 

2303
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:44,940
everything else and what happens one?
Unfortunately she's.

2304
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,670
It was a political issue and she's not a
member of the Liberal Party.

2305
01:39:47,671 --> 01:39:49,430
She's part of the New Democratic Party 
and that's the.

2306
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:52,410
That's a,
you guys have a liberal party.

2307
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,713
We have various.
We have a liberal party that's in power 

2308
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:56,363
across,
on both the federal and provincial 

2309
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:00,630
legislation.
Your king is a liberal,

2310
01:40:00,631 --> 01:40:04,110
right?
King the King Justin Trudeau.

2311
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,160
Yeah.
I like that guy.

2312
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:07,020
He's the one that's going to legalize 
marijuana in Canada.

2313
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,700
Who seems like a cool guy.
I've heard.

2314
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:09,920
I've seen him talk.
I'm like,

2315
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:12,570
I wish we had a candidate for the United
States president like that.

2316
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,330
He's the one who were trying to get 
attention to see if we can't get support

2317
01:40:15,331 --> 01:40:15,960
for this.
Uh,

2318
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,250
for this bill.
We're getting the Benne,

2319
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:18,203
the whales and dolphin captivity.
He definitely should be a part of that 

2320
01:40:20,821 --> 01:40:21,654
and he definitely should step in and do 
something about what's happening with 

2321
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:25,350
you.
Have you guys tried to contact him about

2322
01:40:25,351 --> 01:40:26,071
that?
Uh,

2323
01:40:26,071 --> 01:40:27,000
I've not,
but that's it.

2324
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:30,540
This is something that's governed with 
by Ontario provincial.

2325
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2326
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:31,780
Yeah.
So he,

2327
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:34,050
there's nothing he could do about that,
but he's the king.

2328
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:35,130
He's the king.
Yeah,

2329
01:40:35,131 --> 01:40:37,200
that's right.
Heavy is the crown.

2330
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:38,490
Yeah.
What the fuck.

2331
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,830
You can't just step in.
You'd think you'd tap on the shoulder.

2332
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:42,220
Now granted,
uh,

2333
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:43,263
uh,
I remember touring a lot of public 

2334
01:40:45,571 --> 01:40:48,230
figures and intern during my time at 
Marineland,

2335
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:49,223
including John [inaudible] who was a 
former prime minister's son who still 

2336
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:52,620
goes there.

2337
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:55,280
So there's still some government ties to
marina.

2338
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:57,460
Of course.
I'm still goes there like he visits.

2339
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:00,340
He brings some people to Scuba dive with
the,

2340
01:41:00,341 --> 01:41:01,750
uh,
with the Beluga whales,

2341
01:41:01,751 --> 01:41:04,210
people,
people with disadvantages physically and

2342
01:41:04,211 --> 01:41:04,511
stuff.
It's,

2343
01:41:04,511 --> 01:41:06,720
it's a great program.
But uh,

2344
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,730
that I know of.
He was continuing going up until 2012 at

2345
01:41:09,731 --> 01:41:10,870
least.
I don't know that he still goes,

2346
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:11,763
I haven't been in the park in that long.
It just seems like Canada has so many 

2347
01:41:15,011 --> 01:41:15,844
great things going for it.
And when I hear lawsuits like this and 

2348
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,880
that are so insane,
that lasts for so long.

2349
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,960
And then that your counter lawsuit 
doesn't get any traction at all and that

2350
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:26,794
no one's paying attention to it.
I just don't understand how they can 

2351
01:41:28,571 --> 01:41:31,450
allow that to happen.
That's a good thing.

2352
01:41:31,451 --> 01:41:33,880
There's a lot of people helping us,
right?

2353
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:35,590
I mean,
because it appears that it's going to be

2354
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:37,750
the will of the people versus the 
government.

2355
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,530
Yeah.
Fuck man,

2356
01:41:39,531 --> 01:41:41,310
I don't discourage me man.
I know that.

2357
01:41:41,311 --> 01:41:42,490
I know how I'm.
I hold.

2358
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:44,020
I might hold deep and Shit,
man.

2359
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:44,950
I know.
It's just,

2360
01:41:44,951 --> 01:41:46,390
uh,
it's so frustrating.

2361
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:47,673
It's so frustrating as an observer,
as an outsider looking at this and 

2362
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:51,251
saying,
man,

2363
01:41:51,251 --> 01:41:56,020
this is just so strange.
It's so strange that in this day and age

2364
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,720
this can happen.
Then someone can get away with this.

2365
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:00,640
He hasn't gotten away with it yet.
I ain't done.

2366
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:02,920
But he's getting away with what he's 
doing so far.

2367
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:03,843
So where,
I mean literally the government should 

2368
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:09,280
shut him the fuck down.
They should have stopped this lawsuit.

2369
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,650
They should have been forced to your 
lawsuit against him.

2370
01:42:11,651 --> 01:42:14,260
They should arrest him for stocking the 
whole deal.

2371
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:15,480
The whole deal.
It's just,

2372
01:42:15,481 --> 01:42:19,390
it's all disgusting.
I've become quite jaded and admittedly I

2373
01:42:19,391 --> 01:42:23,110
believed even when we came out that 
there would be some type of justice.

2374
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:23,950
I mean,
that's what we seeking.

2375
01:42:23,951 --> 01:42:24,730
Of course,
right.

2376
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:29,140
Isn't doing this for shits and giggles.
Money is draining that justice.

2377
01:42:29,141 --> 01:42:29,974
When you speak to power,
you can expect some serious 

2378
01:42:31,481 --> 01:42:32,950
consequences.
It's a simple as that,

2379
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:38,040
but it's so insane that the charge is 
attempting to kidnap a Walrus.

2380
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,390
Correct and trespassing.
And here's the challenge,

2381
01:42:40,391 --> 01:42:43,090
and I offer this to all your millions of
viewers and listeners.

2382
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:46,660
You find a single video of the last day.
I can't remember.

2383
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:47,500
Shit,
I think it was April,

2384
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,060
I think.
I believe it was a.

2385
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,810
oh shit.
Why do I not know the date of this?

2386
01:42:52,811 --> 01:42:53,590
Let's,
uh,

2387
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:55,360
let's call it October 17th,
I believe.

2388
01:42:55,361 --> 01:42:56,194
Two thousand 12 marina alleges that I 
broke into the park with these legions 

2389
01:42:59,141 --> 01:43:00,340
of animal rights activists,
which,

2390
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:02,530
which actually did happen.
Not I wasn't there.

2391
01:43:02,590 --> 01:43:04,900
I was on public property.
I did not go into the park,

2392
01:43:05,110 --> 01:43:07,330
but you know,
hundreds did actually storm the gates.

2393
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:08,343
And what marine line alleges that I 
trespassed in there and there's tons of 

2394
01:43:10,631 --> 01:43:11,464
videos.
I mean you can get 15 different vantage 

2395
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:14,043
points.
If any single person finds me in that 

2396
01:43:15,761 --> 01:43:16,594
video,
I will personally cut you a check for 

2397
01:43:17,741 --> 01:43:18,574
one point $5 million dollars.
That doesn't get you to have one point 

2398
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:21,334
$5,000,000.
How would you offer one point 

2399
01:43:22,301 --> 01:43:25,080
$5,000,000?
I'll blow you auntie.

2400
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:25,931
Well,
it's not going to happen.

2401
01:43:25,931 --> 01:43:27,050
Right?
So it was guy about it.

2402
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:28,293
There's no video.
They're going to photoshop you and then 

2403
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:29,983
just for a blowjob,
I was going to someone to use that CGI 

2404
01:43:31,991 --> 01:43:32,824
shit they did with Avatar.
I think I can negotiate my way out of 

2405
01:43:34,721 --> 01:43:35,554
it.
I'll get one point five my hand job 

2406
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:38,670
marilla and thinks they're getting point
five out of me.

2407
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,143
That's what they want.
One point $5 million out of the other 

2408
01:43:42,431 --> 01:43:44,800
guy who essentially is,
but put it this way,

2409
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:47,050
but they're trying to sue you for one 
point $5,000,000.

2410
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:48,310
Yeah.
That's the damage that they're claiming.

2411
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:52,220
What's that in real money in terms of 
like outside of Canada,

2412
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,640
like America where accounts.
Oh,

2413
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,750
let's call it a million bones.
That's a million bones.

2414
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,450
Your money's worth more,
isn't it?

2415
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:01,190
Right now?
Or significantly less.

2416
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:02,690
What?
I'm drinking three beers.

2417
01:44:02,691 --> 01:44:03,970
I can while I'm here.
Well,

2418
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,960
we'll send you some things.
I don't think it's legal.

2419
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:07,910
You send beer across the border.
Probably not.

2420
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:11,100
It's probably a drug is a drug.
Well,

2421
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:14,030
we'll see what Justin Trudeau can do 
about man.

2422
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:15,280
So,
um,

2423
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:18,200
have you gotten any traction on any 
other shows?

2424
01:44:18,201 --> 01:44:19,034
Like any,
uh,

2425
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:19,993
anybody else reached out to you?
That Katelyn podcast was timely and big 

2426
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:24,013
and it was great.
They get a lot of downloads and it's 

2427
01:44:26,411 --> 01:44:29,000
still going.
It was published two weeks ago.

2428
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:30,680
Okay.
So is Canada land,

2429
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:31,620
is what it's called?
Yeah.

2430
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:33,500
And do you know what episode it is?

2431
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,180
It's called Marineland.
Okay.

2432
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:38,110
Everyone loves Murraylands most recent,
uh,

2433
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:39,043
send people to that.
What about a American podcasts of 

2434
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:43,250
people?
I'm Abby Martin,

2435
01:44:43,251 --> 01:44:44,084
thankfully has had me on a couple of 
number of times and through the show 

2436
01:44:46,251 --> 01:44:47,084
I've,
I've received quite a bit of support 

2437
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:49,250
from like what I would call some real 
bad ass.

2438
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:50,360
Awesome people.
So I'm,

2439
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,010
I'm most appreciative.
But beyond that,

2440
01:44:52,011 --> 01:44:52,430
no,
there's,

2441
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:54,110
there's really quite a bit of fear of,
of,

2442
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:56,660
of my speaking.
So there are mostly in Canada,

2443
01:44:56,661 --> 01:44:57,880
right?
Uh,

2444
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,870
mostly in Canada,
in America,

2445
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:02,090
outside magazine,
they quashed that story.

2446
01:45:02,091 --> 01:45:03,410
I mean,
there's gonna be a big feature.

2447
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,940
How did that happen?
Do you know?

2448
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:06,510
So,
yeah,

2449
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:07,640
so the,
uh,

2450
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:10,790
the writer was staying at our place and 
at the time,

2451
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:12,650
uh,
I believe we had a,

2452
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:14,150
there were,
um,

2453
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:18,510
there were people watching us and I had 
specifically said because his,

2454
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:21,560
his rental vehicle was parked across and
here he was sitting on the couch and,

2455
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:22,394
you know,
we're talking and talking and I looked 

2456
01:45:23,431 --> 01:45:24,264
and it was a truck that repeatedly drove
by and stopped and went to the other 

2457
01:45:26,391 --> 01:45:27,080
industry,
turned around.

2458
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:27,590
I said,
fuck,

2459
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:28,850
you're being,
you're being watched.

2460
01:45:28,851 --> 01:45:30,140
Like,
and he's just like,

2461
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:31,123
you know,
I think at this point he didn't truly 

2462
01:45:32,211 --> 01:45:35,210
appreciate the depths that we were in 
and at this point I don't,

2463
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:37,700
we weren't even sued yet.
And uh,

2464
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:38,983
sure shit,
marina named him by name the author and 

2465
01:45:42,021 --> 01:45:43,400
uh,
and that was it.

2466
01:45:43,401 --> 01:45:44,234
So he,
he,

2467
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:45,820
he wouldn't,
I mean,

2468
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:46,753
he,
he tried to get the,

2469
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:47,250
the,
the,

2470
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,490
the article to run,
but outside ultimately said,

2471
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:52,100
we're not interested in being sued now 
it's a different time.

2472
01:45:52,101 --> 01:45:54,680
There's anti slap legislation now,
so outside if you're listening,

2473
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:55,863
but well,
why didn't they just shut their fucking 

2474
01:45:58,761 --> 01:46:02,000
mouth until they published it?
A he was.

2475
01:46:02,001 --> 01:46:03,330
How did they find out what he was 
looking?

2476
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:04,213
He was asking a current and former 
employees to see if anyone would speak 

2477
01:46:06,381 --> 01:46:08,000
and then obviously there was someone 
that went to,

2478
01:46:08,890 --> 01:46:11,460
you know when you live,
when you worked in an oppressive sort of

2479
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:12,710
regime,
if you will,

2480
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:15,140
you're quick to try to score bonus 
points.

2481
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:17,120
I assume the former trainer or someone 
probably said,

2482
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:17,954
hey,
this guy's calling around looking for 

2483
01:46:18,771 --> 01:46:20,900
something.
What other businesses that guy have?

2484
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,760
They're all in house businesses,
but yeah,

2485
01:46:22,761 --> 01:46:24,110
he's got.
He owns a lot of property.

2486
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:25,730
He does.
He owes no one any money.

2487
01:46:25,731 --> 01:46:28,310
There's no outside a financial interest 
whatsoever.

2488
01:46:28,311 --> 01:46:29,144
He is the sole controlling mind.
It seems like God like that needs to 

2489
01:46:32,031 --> 01:46:33,810
come to Jesus moment.
We're just realized.

2490
01:46:33,811 --> 01:46:34,880
It was like,
what am I doing?

2491
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:35,783
My life is.
I mean he's at the later stages of his 

2492
01:46:37,461 --> 01:46:41,450
life and just living like this.
So when people talk anger and evil,

2493
01:46:41,451 --> 01:46:43,700
and I hate to mention it,
but a couple of years ago,

2494
01:46:43,701 --> 01:46:45,470
a few years ago,
and this was my greatest ally,

2495
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,483
his son actually passed away and this 
was the guy who actually allowed into 

2496
01:46:49,411 --> 01:46:52,230
the park when I went unbenounced to me,
I was no longer allowed there.

2497
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:55,090
He let me in and that's when I saw,
you know,

2498
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:56,093
smooshy in the condition that she was in
that ultimately inspired me to sort of 

2499
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:01,540
speak out and not be anonymous.
And uh,

2500
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:04,200
he shortly thereafter actually passed 
away and he was my age.

2501
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:05,960
How did he die?
I had,

2502
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,610
I'm afraid to say,
but I'll say that it was,

2503
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:11,520
I would,
I believe it was avoidable.

2504
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,850
I think that when you live under an 
oppressive and difficult situation,

2505
01:47:17,851 --> 01:47:20,190
especially with regards to your 
relationship with your father,

2506
01:47:20,191 --> 01:47:25,191
that maybe you resort to methods to,
to ease that pain maybe so to,

2507
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:28,720
to sort of a,
I don't know,

2508
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:32,250
maybe forget your woes.
So something drug related.

2509
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:33,770
I don't know.
You don't know.

2510
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:34,730
Okay.
Okay.

2511
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:35,960
I understand what you don't get.
Cheers.

2512
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:37,140
Cool.
Thanks.

2513
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:40,320
So I'm.
So what's the next step?

2514
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,080
Like what happens now,
other than the next step,

2515
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:45,150
tell everybody to go to save 
smooshy.com.

2516
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:46,643
Throw some money around.
The next step would be nice if maybe 

2517
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:51,660
Peta would step up.
I mean in terms of hypocrisy.

2518
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:52,703
Peter likes to use our headlines and to 
raise money for themselves on their 

2519
01:47:56,191 --> 01:47:58,110
websites and they'll donate here.
Look,

2520
01:47:58,170 --> 01:48:00,120
how do you say Murraylands animals 
donate here.

2521
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:01,710
We have not received an iota of help.
In fact,

2522
01:48:01,711 --> 01:48:02,251
I asked them,
look,

2523
01:48:02,251 --> 01:48:03,690
can you,
can I just get a tweet out of you guys?

2524
01:48:03,691 --> 01:48:04,160
And they said,
Oh,

2525
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:05,520
it's a nonprofit.
We've learned that.

2526
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:06,900
That doesn't help.
Wait a minute,

2527
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:07,734
hold on.
So they say donate here to them to help 

2528
01:48:10,921 --> 01:48:13,680
you and the money to them to help them.
They know they don't.

2529
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:16,830
They don't ever say to help to help you.
It's just that they use that stories.

2530
01:48:16,831 --> 01:48:17,260
They'll be like,
oh,

2531
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:19,450
mass graves found out marine land and 
then you know,

2532
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,460
there's the article and it's whole.

2533
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,293
It's horrifying.
Filled the says donate here and the 

2534
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:24,510
donate.
Donate,

2535
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:26,420
donate.
Here's the donate to Peta.

2536
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:28,320
Yeah,
it's tough man.

2537
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:30,510
Well,
they're too busy killing cats and dogs.

2538
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:34,110
And tweeting you on Orca Day tweeting 
Joe Rogan,

2539
01:48:34,111 --> 01:48:34,944
the guy who's,
who's throwing arrows into every animal 

2540
01:48:36,211 --> 01:48:39,170
that,
and they're asking you for retweets.

2541
01:48:39,171 --> 01:48:40,470
I thought,
I actually thought that was brilliant.

2542
01:48:40,471 --> 01:48:41,040
I'm like,
wow.

2543
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:42,150
Pete is like,
really?

2544
01:48:42,151 --> 01:48:42,860
Uh,
they're,

2545
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:44,720
they're showing their true colors,
but well,

2546
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:47,430
they know that I do love orcas.
Yeah,

2547
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:49,080
fair enough.
Just love to eat deer,

2548
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:52,170
right?
Fair enough.

2549
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:55,620
I don't throw ours into everything.
Not only edible stuff,

2550
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,980
but I mean,
they,

2551
01:48:59,010 --> 01:48:59,843
they've,
they've retweeted things that I've 

2552
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:02,370
posted up about,
um,

2553
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:08,000
about orcas and particularly about my,
my low thing of orchid captivity.

2554
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:12,510
And I think there's new laws had been 
passed in California,

2555
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:14,320
right?
So recently seaworld.

2556
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:15,233
So what happened with seaworld,
they had to ask permission from the 

2557
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:22,650
California Coastal Commission for a 
$100,000,000 expansion of their pools of

2558
01:49:22,651 --> 01:49:23,340
the existing pools.

2559
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:25,740
What they've said is,
we're going to eliminate the show,

2560
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:28,740
which is not true.
That's not true in any capacity.

2561
01:49:28,741 --> 01:49:30,840
What they're going to do is create a new
environment.

2562
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:32,130
The larger one,
which is good,

2563
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,970
but they're still going to have a 
presentation of sorts.

2564
01:49:34,971 --> 01:49:36,670
It's going to rely on,
you know,

2565
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:39,420
animals performing more natural 
behaviors,

2566
01:49:39,421 --> 01:49:40,254
but still is going to be food 
deprivation in the train and it's going 

2567
01:49:41,821 --> 01:49:42,390
to be,
you know,

2568
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:43,530
it's the same thing.
It's just,

2569
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:46,620
it's presented differently.
So what the,

2570
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:48,700
what the California coastal commission 
said was,

2571
01:49:48,701 --> 01:49:49,250
look,
we'll,

2572
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:51,580
we'll grant you permission to make this 
large expanse,

2573
01:49:51,581 --> 01:49:56,581
but you can't breed a orcas anymore.
So what seaworld basically said was,

2574
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:58,750
okay,
well a,

2575
01:49:58,751 --> 01:49:59,584
they've,
they've considered not doing it 

2576
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:00,844
altogether be now they're suing the 
California coastal commission alleging 

2577
01:50:03,701 --> 01:50:05,200
that they've,
they've overstepped their boundaries,

2578
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:07,450
but what's really.
So they want to keep breeding them.

2579
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,040
Exactly.
Doesn't that tell you everything?

2580
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:12,520
They're all of a sudden they're not 
gonna going to create this large habitat

2581
01:50:12,521 --> 01:50:16,390
for the existing animals that they 
supposedly care so much for.

2582
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:19,360
But if there's that clause for breeding,
not they're not going to do it.

2583
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:20,690
I mean that says it all.
Really?

2584
01:50:20,691 --> 01:50:21,640
It does.
Wow.

2585
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,563
So they're not going to create the new,
larger environment just because they're 

2586
01:50:25,361 --> 01:50:27,040
not allowed to breed them because 
they've got this clause.

2587
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:27,611
Well,
they're going to sue,

2588
01:50:27,611 --> 01:50:29,260
I assume,
to try to have that overturned where,

2589
01:50:29,261 --> 01:50:31,660
which I hope the California coastal 
commission would reconsider their,

2590
01:50:31,661 --> 01:50:32,490
uh,
their approval of.

2591
01:50:32,490 --> 01:50:35,010
They should step it up and just make the
whole fucking thing illegal.

2592
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:36,040
Jerry Brown,
come on.

2593
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:37,240
Jerry Brown,
you're a hippie.

2594
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:39,670
There is a,
there is a recently tabled bill,

2595
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:43,300
which is a federal ban across the states
for a Orca captivity.

2596
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:44,440
They should,
they should.

2597
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:46,230
One hundred percent.
I mean that.

2598
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:51,770
I wish there was a way that they could 
hook up a fucking machine to a pond or a

2599
01:50:52,031 --> 01:50:52,864
pool or an Orca is and have that orchid 
communicate and have it broken down to 

2600
01:50:55,841 --> 01:50:58,990
English.
Now we have google translate for Russian

2601
01:50:58,991 --> 01:51:01,840
and Spanish.
How about an orchid translate?

2602
01:51:01,841 --> 01:51:02,674
If they've,
if they figured out a way to 

2603
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:05,013
scientifically without debate,
analyze the sounds and break them down 

2604
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:10,864
into an English language that we could,
could read and understand that people 

2605
01:51:14,291 --> 01:51:15,670
would be mortified.
Oh my God,

2606
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,800
what if work has just started saying 
really racist shit.

2607
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:22,180
Just hate Chinese people.
Well,

2608
01:51:22,181 --> 01:51:23,870
they have reasonably well.
Maybe not the Orcas,

2609
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:25,683
dolphins and whatnot have reason to hate
the people of Japan who are just 

2610
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:29,974
repeatedly a hacking them up.
And then of course in the Faroe Islands 

2611
01:51:32,951 --> 01:51:33,784
where,
and I watched the video of our 

2612
01:51:34,781 --> 01:51:37,090
documentary on what's called the grinned
is when they,

2613
01:51:37,091 --> 01:51:37,640
uh,
they,

2614
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,310
they,
they do these drive fisheries,

2615
01:51:39,311 --> 01:51:40,450
what they do,
they drive the animals,

2616
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,200
their sonic animals,
so you know,

2617
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:43,143
pound the bottom of the ocean floor or 
these metal rods into other steel 

2618
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:45,940
structures.

2619
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:48,580
And then the herds,
the animals onto the land.

2620
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:49,443
Well,
what they do here in the Faroe Islands 

2621
01:51:50,481 --> 01:51:51,314
is they grabbed these hooks and they 
embed it in the fucking blow hole of 

2622
01:51:54,611 --> 01:51:55,270
the,
uh,

2623
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:56,103
of the pilot whales for instance.
And there's a long rope and then the 

2624
01:51:58,001 --> 01:52:00,820
people drag these things up and then 
they go up and then hack their throat,

2625
01:52:00,821 --> 01:52:01,654
right?
They want to call it substitute 

2626
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:02,913
subsistence hunting.
But it's hard to call that subsistence 

2627
01:52:05,381 --> 01:52:06,880
hunting.
Maybe historically it has been,

2628
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:09,730
but it's pretty brutal.
So they eat the pilot whales,

2629
01:52:09,731 --> 01:52:11,650
is that what it is?
They eat the pilot whales.

2630
01:52:11,651 --> 01:52:13,750
Yeah.
But if I,

2631
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:15,180
I'm,
I'm of the opinion that it's,

2632
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:18,400
it's a,
it's a cultural thing and they're on the

2633
01:52:18,401 --> 01:52:19,960
wrong side of history.
Now you've done it.

2634
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:21,460
It's done.
It's documented.

2635
01:52:21,461 --> 01:52:22,570
You've got the photos,
if you will.

2636
01:52:22,571 --> 01:52:24,140
The history's there.
Let it be there.

2637
01:52:24,450 --> 01:52:26,050
Keep it in the history books.
Well,

2638
01:52:26,110 --> 01:52:26,943
it's one of those things where if you 
look at the environments where they eat 

2639
01:52:30,131 --> 01:52:31,270
whales,
they,

2640
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:35,560
there's people starving.
There's desperation in those places.

2641
01:52:35,561 --> 01:52:39,130
I'm not going to argue in subsistence.
Eating and hunting is important.

2642
01:52:39,131 --> 01:52:39,964
I don't doubt that.
But in the Faroe Islands across from 

2643
01:52:41,441 --> 01:52:43,930
where they're doing the grind is a law 
is a vast,

2644
01:52:43,931 --> 01:52:45,790
beautiful cityscape.
Like you can't tell me,

2645
01:52:45,791 --> 01:52:48,440
you can't just go grab a couple eggs and
a cellphone omelet.

2646
01:52:48,690 --> 01:52:53,690
I don't know what you're saying.
The Dolphin thing in the movie the cove,

2647
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:56,750
which is what you talked about about 
Japan,

2648
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:57,853
they,
um,

2649
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:59,780
they tried.
They were killing them because they were

2650
01:52:59,781 --> 01:53:00,770
eating the tuner,
right?

2651
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:01,604
Isn't that the idea behind it?
They will use anything to defend the 

2652
01:53:04,011 --> 01:53:04,844
culture of killing these dolphins.
But really it's fueled by the captivity 

2653
01:53:07,161 --> 01:53:09,290
industry.
Those dolphins are invaluable.

2654
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:10,400
And,
and places like,

2655
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,920
and I'm not gonna say seaworld now 
because it's been a number of years,

2656
01:53:12,921 --> 01:53:13,754
but they have,
they have historically acquired animals 

2657
01:53:14,901 --> 01:53:15,734
from these drive fisheries,
but they buy these animals and these 

2658
01:53:18,021 --> 01:53:19,910
hunters are driving around in fucking 
porsches and shit.

2659
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:20,763
It's not because they're,
they're chopping these dolphins up for 

2660
01:53:22,341 --> 01:53:23,420
meat.
That's not,

2661
01:53:23,421 --> 01:53:24,980
that's not the,
that's not the thriving industry.

2662
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:25,843
It's the captivity industry.
They're selling them when they're 

2663
01:53:27,261 --> 01:53:28,094
killing all those.
Why would they kill them if they could 

2664
01:53:29,511 --> 01:53:30,344
sell them?
Well?

2665
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:31,223
Well,
because they're not aesthetically 

2666
01:53:31,401 --> 01:53:32,330
pleasing.
They take,

2667
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:33,223
they take so many of the animals,
they take the more aesthetically 

2668
01:53:34,581 --> 01:53:35,630
pleasing.
What do they sell them for?

2669
01:53:35,631 --> 01:53:36,221
The,
you know,

2670
01:53:36,221 --> 01:53:37,054
the tens of thousands or hundreds of 
thousands of dollars when they chop up 

2671
01:53:39,171 --> 01:53:40,610
the dolphins.
And then they,

2672
01:53:40,611 --> 01:53:41,001
uh,
they,

2673
01:53:41,001 --> 01:53:41,834
they,
they,

2674
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:42,673
whenever,
I guess they gave him the supermarkets 

2675
01:53:43,971 --> 01:53:46,200
and whatnot,
but to give him the supermarkets are,

2676
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:47,020
softens.

2677
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:48,140
Yeah.
I've never been,

2678
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:50,720
I've been in Japan and every dolphins,
but in Japan,

2679
01:53:50,721 --> 01:53:51,554
the dolphin they have.
I think that that's something that's 

2680
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:54,850
going away.
I think the,

2681
01:53:54,851 --> 01:53:58,190
the,
the new sort of generations of kids.

2682
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,333
I didn't watch the cove because I didn't
want to see it because I've seen enough 

2683
01:54:01,101 --> 01:54:02,950
youtube videos of it.
It's just,

2684
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,540
it's horrific.
I can't watch burger.

2685
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:08,230
I didn't know that they ate them.
Yeah.

2686
01:54:08,270 --> 01:54:09,103
Well,
and what we're coming to learn is that 

2687
01:54:10,101 --> 01:54:12,740
there's a high levels of mercury and 
this in the dolphin meat,

2688
01:54:12,741 --> 01:54:13,574
so they're actually,
it's actually poisoning people so that 

2689
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:15,980
people are really getting away from 
that,

2690
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:19,070
but more than not,
I think it's front to keep the captivity

2691
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:19,933
industry going and to keep that money 
there because they sell them to places 

2692
01:54:23,091 --> 01:54:25,650
in China.
They sell them the places in wherever,

2693
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:26,533
in in Japan itself,
and there's a lot of money that's being 

2694
01:54:28,251 --> 01:54:31,670
exchanged between the facilities and the
and the hunters.

2695
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:34,010
So outside of Canada and the United 
States,

2696
01:54:34,011 --> 01:54:34,844
there's a bunch of places in the world 
that still have those sort of marine 

2697
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:38,990
type shows.
China,

2698
01:54:38,991 --> 01:54:41,150
especially right now,
China is really starting to,

2699
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:43,470
is like a burgeoning environment for the
captivity into.

2700
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:44,950
So they're ramping it up.
They're there.

2701
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:47,420
They're plucking elephants out of,
uh,

2702
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:49,200
out of Thailand and stuff.
I mean,

2703
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:52,490
I mean wild caught wild barn baby 
elephants.

2704
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:53,324
They're stripping them from their and 
from their mothers and their shipping 

2705
01:54:54,531 --> 01:54:56,330
them to these places in China.
Now the zoos.

2706
01:54:56,331 --> 01:54:58,580
I mean this is another thing that has to
stop now.

2707
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:00,570
Right?
Trying.

2708
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,810
Damn that dog festivals rough.
Yeah.

2709
01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:09,830
The Yulin dog festival.
I watched that the other day on TV.

2710
01:55:09,831 --> 01:55:10,664
There was some sort of a special.
This woman goes over there and it was 

2711
01:55:14,511 --> 01:55:17,030
interesting though,
the way the Chinese people looked at it,

2712
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:19,400
you know,
and it's hard to argue,

2713
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:20,413
you know,
they're looking at the same way we look 

2714
01:55:21,381 --> 01:55:22,214
at Bacon.

2715
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:24,530
It offers great perspective for the 
people that are,

2716
01:55:24,531 --> 01:55:25,364
for instance,
saying,

2717
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:28,460
I will never fucking eat this dog.
Well guess what,

2718
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:31,690
it's not any different.
It's no less a conscious being then your

2719
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,730
pigs who are arguably significantly more
intelligent than,

2720
01:55:34,731 --> 01:55:35,564
uh,
than dogs or your cows or your whatever 

2721
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:38,073
it is what it is.
But it does offer a glimpse into the 

2722
01:55:39,351 --> 01:55:41,870
hypocrisy of loving one animal and 
eating the neck.

2723
01:55:41,871 --> 01:55:44,850
So I appreciate this thing.
Offers that context.

2724
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:45,833
It's bizarre how we have these ideas,
these hierarchies of animals were this 

2725
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,320
one.
It's okay to kill an Itam.

2726
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:54,720
This one that's not.
It seems more novelty based.

2727
01:55:54,721 --> 01:55:55,560
Really?
Yeah,

2728
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:56,423
because I mean,
you can make a hell of a hell of a pet 

2729
01:55:57,871 --> 01:55:59,730
out of a pig,
but it's less cute.

2730
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:00,743
Well,
there was a guy who had a pig the other 

2731
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:03,090
day.
Where the fuck were we?

2732
01:56:03,710 --> 01:56:06,210
Um,
somewhere here in California.

2733
01:56:06,211 --> 01:56:08,430
Guy had a pig on a leash.
Awesome.

2734
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:09,413
Yeah.
Well the dog is a dog and a pig and he 

2735
01:56:10,551 --> 01:56:11,640
had the pig on a leash like,
well,

2736
01:56:11,641 --> 01:56:13,440
okay.
I don't quote me,

2737
01:56:13,441 --> 01:56:16,620
but the intelligence of a pig is,
from what I believe,

2738
01:56:16,621 --> 01:56:17,454
I remember they're very smart.
Ten year old or something human like my 

2739
01:56:20,491 --> 01:56:25,491
kid because it's so much smarter than 
the human mind fucking kid.

2740
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,680
No,
there's supposed to be intelligent.

2741
01:56:28,681 --> 01:56:30,180
I don't know if there were like a 10 
year old,

2742
01:56:30,181 --> 01:56:32,160
but they're supposed to be quite 
intelligent.

2743
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:34,530
It's hard to.
It's hard to quantify,

2744
01:56:34,610 --> 01:56:35,790
you know,
like octopus.

2745
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:37,860
They're just starting to realize how 
intelligent octopus.

2746
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:39,770
Of course I eat the fuck out.
Was anxious.

2747
01:56:40,030 --> 01:56:41,250
Tuna,
tuna,

2748
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,020
tuna or intelligent apparently.
Brilliant.

2749
01:56:43,021 --> 01:56:44,130
Yeah.
Really?

2750
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:45,610
Yeah.
Well to some,

2751
01:56:45,690 --> 01:56:48,120
I guess wasn't smart enough to stay out 
of the cans.

2752
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:49,690
Cans of tuna room soon.

2753
01:56:49,730 --> 01:56:50,320
Sure,
sure,

2754
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:51,630
sure.
Are fucking.

2755
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:52,523
The ocean's fisheries are decimated.
I think we've got basically an expiry 

2756
01:56:55,471 --> 01:56:58,620
date of uh,
I think they said 2014.

2757
01:56:58,670 --> 01:56:59,503
I watched a documentary called end of 
the line recently and they basically 

2758
01:57:02,341 --> 01:57:03,174
said that 90 percent of the ocean's 
fisheries are fucking gone in tune 

2759
01:57:05,641 --> 01:57:07,590
especially is really susceptible to 
extinction.

2760
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:10,970
And that's just because we just overfish
over fish and the,

2761
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:13,860
it's the methods that we do it.
And I mean you get these trout,

2762
01:57:13,890 --> 01:57:14,723
you've got these trawlers that are,
that are setting up nets to the size of 

2763
01:57:17,101 --> 01:57:19,810
football fields and they're just 
grinding the,

2764
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:22,110
the ocean floor and it's just decimating
the ocean.

2765
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:23,740
Yeah.
It ruins the bed,

2766
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,580
the ecology as a whole.
It fucks up coral reefs.

2767
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:27,990
Everything.
And what?

2768
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:31,320
What can be done about that?
I mean they've got to leave it alone and

2769
01:57:31,321 --> 01:57:32,430
let these things grow back.

2770
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:34,830
It all comes down to what you can do 
with your wallet if you don't,

2771
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:38,010
if you're not spending the money to go 
to a,

2772
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:40,350
you know,
a Nobu and get that,

2773
01:57:40,351 --> 01:57:41,030
uh,
that,

2774
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:43,840
that piece of Tofu or rather that whole 
shit,

2775
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:46,650
that piece of tuna,
then,

2776
01:57:46,651 --> 01:57:49,080
uh,
then you assume that in some way,

2777
01:57:49,081 --> 01:57:51,240
shape or form that that's gonna,
that's gonna curb this behavior.

2778
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:52,074
But there's got to be.
The problem is also that the ocean is 

2779
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:55,374
not like,
like if you're in a country in the 

2780
01:57:57,361 --> 01:58:00,540
country establishes like bag limits on 
animals,

2781
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,850
they can keep the populations very 
healthy.

2782
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:07,260
Precisely do that with an ocean is 
governing the oceans very aggressively.

2783
01:58:07,290 --> 01:58:08,123
Well,
if they were this whole thing in China 

2784
01:58:09,361 --> 01:58:11,810
or Japan wouldn't be taking place with 
the dolphins.

2785
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:16,820
You want people that are doing it is sea
shepherd and unfortunately a Paul Watson

2786
01:58:17,611 --> 01:58:21,090
is considered a terrorist and a lot of 
countries and can actually set foot on,

2787
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:22,180
on sound,
on,

2788
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:25,000
on firm land,
right?

2789
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:26,033
Some countries funny.
He's the one that's being like a 

2790
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:28,763
demonized for,
for really trying to save the fucking 

2791
01:58:30,361 --> 01:58:31,300
planet.
Well,

2792
01:58:31,301 --> 01:58:32,134
the one of the things they've done in 
Japan where they've sort of skirted 

2793
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:39,030
around this whale killing thing is they 
say that they're doing it for scientific

2794
01:58:39,031 --> 01:58:39,864
research,
but then they take these animals on 

2795
01:58:41,671 --> 01:58:41,980
board and

2796
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,480
they butcher them and they sell the 
meat,

2797
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:44,973
but it's so fucked up.
All they have to do is like pretend to 

2798
01:58:47,441 --> 01:58:51,550
run a few tests and they've documented.
The Sea Shepherd has done that.

2799
01:58:51,551 --> 01:58:54,820
They've documented these whalers and 
they're doing it in whale sanctuaries.

2800
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:56,590
They're doing the places where it 
shouldn't be done,

2801
01:58:56,591 --> 01:58:58,780
but it's not monitored by anyone except 
for sea shepherd.

2802
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:01,780
End of the world,
brother fucking.

2803
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:02,643
It's not though because this is the 
first time ever where people are wildly 

2804
01:59:06,461 --> 01:59:09,370
aware of this kind of activity and this 
is where I credit this show.

2805
01:59:09,371 --> 01:59:11,860
I'm telling you,
I'm sitting here before you as a fan,

2806
01:59:11,861 --> 01:59:12,694
first and foremost,
you've illuminated so many issues and 

2807
01:59:15,701 --> 01:59:20,500
like broadened my spectrum of my 
consciousness so much I am.

2808
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:21,334
Now.
I can tell you I am in the seat of that 

2809
01:59:23,021 --> 01:59:27,470
of your millions of listeners.
I am that person right now.

2810
01:59:27,550 --> 01:59:28,600
St Himself.
Damn.

2811
01:59:28,601 --> 01:59:31,840
I wish I could be on that fucking show.
I just happen to do something that,

2812
01:59:31,841 --> 01:59:32,410
you know,
my,

2813
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:34,600
my life circumstances just ultimately 
led me here,

2814
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:37,010
but I am that guy and I have to extend 
another,

2815
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:41,230
you know,
a big thank you for ultimately shaping a

2816
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:44,380
paradigm that is shifting so God damn 
fast and so many different levels and so

2817
01:59:44,381 --> 01:59:45,214
many different topics out there.
And largely what you did started what 

2818
01:59:47,261 --> 01:59:48,094
six years ago,
I believe it was when you started the 

2819
01:59:49,331 --> 01:59:51,080
podcast,
you know,

2820
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:55,600
you're the guy who did this so well.
I couldn't have done it if it wasn't for

2821
01:59:55,601 --> 01:59:56,950
people like you being on the show 
though.

2822
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:59,680
Well all I'm doing is having 
conversations with cool people.

2823
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:02,950
It's this whole thing has made itself.
It's very bizarre.

2824
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:07,000
I love that.
My ass is in some way of making physical

2825
02:00:07,001 --> 02:00:09,310
contact with some awesome assets that 
have sat here.

2826
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:10,170
Man.
You know,

2827
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,400
we're sharing an interesting way of 
looking at it.

2828
02:00:12,401 --> 02:00:13,860
I love it.
I love him running up against.

2829
02:00:13,861 --> 02:00:16,010
It's going on.
Be able to grasp radon.

2830
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:20,770
He wasn't in that one that was old,
old seats already mentioned.

2831
02:00:20,771 --> 02:00:22,030
These are pretty,
these are dope,

2832
02:00:22,031 --> 02:00:22,421
right?
Yeah.

2833
02:00:22,421 --> 02:00:26,440
They are saying to Ergo depot for uh,
providing me with these,

2834
02:00:26,441 --> 02:00:27,274
these are called [inaudible] Pisco 
chairs because people constantly ask me 

2835
02:00:29,741 --> 02:00:32,230
on twitter.
There are super comfortable.

2836
02:00:32,231 --> 02:00:35,080
They're ergonomic chairs well to,
well they move well,

2837
02:00:35,081 --> 02:00:35,914
but here's the most important thing.
These are the only chairs I have ever 

2838
02:00:37,631 --> 02:00:38,464
sat in that are comfortable that I can 
sit for a three hour podcasts and my 

2839
02:00:40,961 --> 02:00:43,060
back doesn't hurt.
It's got the lumbar support and yeah.

2840
02:00:43,061 --> 02:00:46,810
Well when I leave let's just forces you 
to sit in a way where your direct,

2841
02:00:46,811 --> 02:00:47,644
which is how we're supposed to sit.
And when I would sit in like a standard 

2842
02:00:50,621 --> 02:00:54,310
office chair by the end of the day,
my back is all fucked up from Jujitsu.

2843
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:55,143
So like the middle of my back would be 
hurting like hell leave podcast and I'd 

2844
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:02,410
be all stiff.
I leave these like I like,

2845
02:01:02,411 --> 02:01:03,244
I just like I feel right now like I just
sat down like it doesn't bother me at 

2846
02:01:06,131 --> 02:01:06,521
all.
Yeah.

2847
02:01:06,521 --> 02:01:08,650
Full disclosure,
I was moving in my seat because I'm just

2848
02:01:08,651 --> 02:01:11,740
fidgety guy.
Comfortable these ergonomic chairs,

2849
02:01:11,741 --> 02:01:12,820
man,
they are the future.

2850
02:01:12,821 --> 02:01:14,340
They are the,
they are the present there,

2851
02:01:14,341 --> 02:01:14,920
there,
there,

2852
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:17,830
there is so much better than a regular 
office chair.

2853
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:18,783
Regular office chairs cause you to sit 
in as sort of a weird way unless you 

2854
02:01:21,790 --> 02:01:26,260
consciously like I need to get these 
fucking things to the UFC because when I

2855
02:01:26,261 --> 02:01:31,261
sit and watch the UFC for six hours,
I sit like a hot chick on instagram.

2856
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:34,450
Like when they stick their ass out.
That's how I sit.

2857
02:01:34,451 --> 02:01:38,140
I've purposely forced myself to sit in 
this unnatural way.

2858
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:41,050
Whereas if I had chairs like this,
I would just uh,

2859
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:43,460
yeah.
So ergo depot Holler at me,

2860
02:01:43,461 --> 02:01:48,461
we'll send these bitches over to the UFC
and the UFC has um,

2861
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:49,993
you know,
they use the chairs that are there at 

2862
02:01:50,501 --> 02:01:54,410
the Mandalay bay or mgm or whatever.
But my point is these are the shit.

2863
02:01:54,530 --> 02:01:55,363
Yeah,
the great.

2864
02:01:55,670 --> 02:01:56,503
Um.
Anything else before we wrap this thing 

2865
02:01:57,441 --> 02:01:59,300
up?
Everything else I could talk for hours,

2866
02:01:59,301 --> 02:02:00,134
man.
Wrap it up and let him do anything else 

2867
02:02:00,711 --> 02:02:04,810
important that we left off the table.
Oh Shit can.

2868
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:06,410
I know you got a whole notebook there,
dude.

2869
02:02:06,411 --> 02:02:08,210
You're like a comedian.
You have like notes.

2870
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:09,220
It's my process.
Oh,

2871
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:10,063
AG gag laws.
You're familiar with ag gag laws is 

2872
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:12,943
agriculture laws that a factory farming 
and the perfect example of what we're 

2873
02:02:16,461 --> 02:02:17,294
going through.
This is a microcosm of what we're 

2874
02:02:17,991 --> 02:02:18,650
dealing with.

2875
02:02:18,650 --> 02:02:21,200
Greenland sort of gets creative and sort
of creating their own little law,

2876
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:24,080
the Ag gag sort of procedures with 
existing laws,

2877
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:26,360
but yeah,
these ag gag laws are just a.

2878
02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:30,260
just an absolute.
Just the fucking horrible thing.

2879
02:02:30,490 --> 02:02:31,323
I mean to to to be able to prosecute and
punish people that are trying to expose 

2880
02:02:35,481 --> 02:02:40,100
the truth of farming and agriculture 
practices.

2881
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:41,720
This is absurd.
This is fucking crazy,

2882
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:42,560
right?
Yeah.

2883
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:46,070
Well what they're doing is if people 
have a video,

2884
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:49,760
like a cell phone video or something 
like that,

2885
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:50,623
and you film pigs in captivity or 
chickens or anything in agriculture 

2886
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:59,510
where they have factory farming,
you can get sued and you can go to jail.

2887
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:00,823
Like you can go to jail for exposing 
something that makes people sick and a 

2888
02:03:03,801 --> 02:03:06,170
reality of business.
If you're buying something.

2889
02:03:06,171 --> 02:03:10,580
I feel like if I'm buying a chicken and 
then I find out,

2890
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,473
oh,
I can no longer be detached from this 

2891
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:14,594
process because now I know exactly how 
this chicken left and I feel horrible 

2892
02:03:17,241 --> 02:03:17,900
about it.

2893
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:18,733
I've been educated and so that company 
needs to change its practices because I 

2894
02:03:22,221 --> 02:03:24,590
don't want to buy chickens from them 
anymore and if some people do,

2895
02:03:24,591 --> 02:03:28,850
that's fine with them,
but to stop people from filming that and

2896
02:03:28,851 --> 02:03:32,390
showing you what you're trying to keep 
people in the dark or misleading people,

2897
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:33,290
what you're,
you're,

2898
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:36,560
you're hiding facts,
you're hiding truth.

2899
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:41,390
That's not cool and this is exactly what
we're dealing with in reality.

2900
02:03:41,391 --> 02:03:42,680
Right?
It's the same fucking thing.

2901
02:03:42,681 --> 02:03:43,490
Yeah,
it is.

2902
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:45,260
It is.
It is exactly the same thing.

2903
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:47,950
Hiding truth,
hiding reality and,

2904
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:48,793
and,
and trying to keep people from being 

2905
02:03:50,690 --> 02:03:54,940
aware of what's essentially torture.
You know,

2906
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:59,480
I buy as little meat as possible and no 
eggs.

2907
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:00,583
I don't buy any eggs from anyway unless 
I'm in a restaurant or something like 

2908
02:04:02,511 --> 02:04:03,261
that.
For your own chickens.

2909
02:04:03,261 --> 02:04:05,710
I have my own chickens and I,
I have like,

2910
02:04:06,410 --> 02:04:08,630
I've,
I have a good feeling.

2911
02:04:08,750 --> 02:04:10,010
I my chickens,
like me,

2912
02:04:10,430 --> 02:04:11,263
they come to me like I come out to them 
and I bring food and like what's up 

2913
02:04:13,971 --> 02:04:14,804
kids?
Hey girls and I put the plate down 

2914
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:17,390
there.
They're not scared of me.

2915
02:04:17,391 --> 02:04:20,240
They run over and they lay eggs and I 
take the eggs.

2916
02:04:20,241 --> 02:04:23,810
Sometimes they pick on me when I tried 
to steal their eggs but like reach under

2917
02:04:23,811 --> 02:04:27,560
them to take him,
but they barely know me.

2918
02:04:27,561 --> 02:04:28,580
That could,
you could take them,

2919
02:04:28,820 --> 02:04:29,653
but my point is it's like I enjoy that 
relationship and I know that not 

2920
02:04:32,661 --> 02:04:34,490
everybody can have that sort of 
relationship,

2921
02:04:34,491 --> 02:04:38,190
but that is what you want.
If you want eggs,

2922
02:04:38,191 --> 02:04:39,024
like Peta has these really ridiculous 
campaigns against chickens and against 

2923
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:43,703
eggs where they call it a chicken period
and they have a frying pan on their 

2924
02:04:47,971 --> 02:04:51,020
website with a pair of panties that has 
like a,

2925
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:55,410
a fucking bloody spot on the panties and
you're frying the period.

2926
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:57,390
It's so bizarre.
Have you ever seen any Jamie?

2927
02:04:57,810 --> 02:05:00,060
Pull it up.
Periods tasted as good as eggs.

2928
02:05:00,061 --> 02:05:01,830
I don't think there'd be an issue,
but there is.

2929
02:05:01,831 --> 02:05:05,160
Don't do something with Jesus.
Come on.

2930
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:07,380
How dare you take a penny?
What's the problem?

2931
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:10,630
How dare you keep going?
Um,

2932
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:13,230
the problem is captivity.
It's not eggs.

2933
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:16,140
Joel Salitan,
who is a really fascinating guy.

2934
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:18,720
I had him on my podcast and he's an 
advocate of,

2935
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:21,200
of what you would call natural farming 
when he,

2936
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:22,613
when he,
um,

2937
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:25,560
has pigs,
what he does is he puts this enormous,

2938
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:28,740
um,
electrical fence up and the pigs,

2939
02:05:28,741 --> 02:05:30,200
they don't want to go near the fence.
It's sort of,

2940
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:33,030
it doesn't hurt him,
zaps them so they don't pass it.

2941
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:37,860
And then they moved the fence so they 
continue to graze and new property.

2942
02:05:37,861 --> 02:05:41,100
So they're eating acorns and roots and 
all natural things that pigs eat.

2943
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:44,040
And that's what he does with these pigs,
with chickens.

2944
02:05:44,041 --> 02:05:47,220
The same thing.
He has these enormous chicken houses and

2945
02:05:47,221 --> 02:05:50,340
they roll them to new environments.
And so on his farm,

2946
02:05:50,341 --> 02:05:51,840
this chicken house,
um,

2947
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:52,400
the,
the,

2948
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:56,730
the Hen House has rollers on it and 
they'll move it to a new area.

2949
02:05:56,731 --> 02:05:58,350
And the chickens,
my chickens,

2950
02:05:58,351 --> 02:05:59,184
I opened the gates and my chickens run 
around my yard and then they go back in 

2951
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:04,140
the hen house at night.
It's what they do,

2952
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:06,600
they so stimulating for them because 
they get a new environment all the time.

2953
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:07,830
Yes,
and they're free.

2954
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:08,693
They're literally free and when you get 
eggs from those kinds of chickens or a 

2955
02:06:11,131 --> 02:06:13,440
dark orange,
like a really dark,

2956
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:14,753
deep orange,
and that's because it's much healthier 

2957
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:21,090
than when you see something that says 
like vegetarian fed chickens.

2958
02:06:21,450 --> 02:06:23,760
Guess what?
Chickens aren't vegetarians.

2959
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:24,683
They're fucking dinosaurs.
I fed my chickens a mouse once and 

2960
02:06:27,601 --> 02:06:30,180
here's another example of like the 
hierarchy of animals.

2961
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:31,013
We love animals we don't love.
It's really interesting how this 

2962
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:37,170
happened in my house.
My kids found a hawk.

2963
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:41,640
The Hawk slammed into a,
I think a window or something.

2964
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:42,523
Not sure we weren't there,
but we found this wounded Hawk so my 

2965
02:06:45,181 --> 02:06:50,181
kids decided that we were going to do is
we're going to take this hawk and get it

2966
02:06:50,671 --> 02:06:51,504
to a wildlife rescue organization.
So they had to feed it because it was 

2967
02:06:54,481 --> 02:06:57,510
over the weekend and the rescue 
organization wasn't open,

2968
02:06:57,780 --> 02:07:00,720
so they went to the pet store and they 
got the called Pinkies,

2969
02:07:00,721 --> 02:07:02,470
which are these little tiny mice.
Yeah.

2970
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:03,473
For the people listening,
their mice that haven't their baby mice 

2971
02:07:06,450 --> 02:07:08,670
and they use them to feed snakes and 
stuff like that,

2972
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:09,653
and so they fed the hawk,
these pinkies and there was one pinky 

2973
02:07:12,961 --> 02:07:16,800
left and they got the hock to the 
wildlife rescue organization.

2974
02:07:16,801 --> 02:07:17,634
The Hawk was taken care of and 
everything and hopefully was released 

2975
02:07:19,801 --> 02:07:22,470
into the wild,
but we had one pinky leftover.

2976
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:24,240
My daughter wanted to raise it and I 
said,

2977
02:07:24,241 --> 02:07:26,100
sweetie,
this is going to die.

2978
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:28,080
It's not.
It has to eat milk.

2979
02:07:28,081 --> 02:07:30,720
It's only been alive for a few days.
It's just not going to last.

2980
02:07:30,721 --> 02:07:33,720
I'm amazed it's still alive and she was 
crying and I said,

2981
02:07:33,721 --> 02:07:36,640
but we just fed them to the hawks.
Do you understand this?

2982
02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:39,130
I go,
there's one of two things we should do.

2983
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:40,053
I go,
we should either bring it back to the 

2984
02:07:41,471 --> 02:07:43,450
pet store.
No,

2985
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:44,350
I go,
listen,

2986
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:46,350
if we don't bring it back to the pet 
store,

2987
02:07:46,351 --> 02:07:48,310
it's going to die.
We bring them back to the pet store,

2988
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:49,173
the pets pet store.
I don't know if the mouse will accept 

2989
02:07:52,691 --> 02:07:54,310
it.
Now that we've got our scent on it.

2990
02:07:54,311 --> 02:07:57,520
I don't know how that works,
but they're going to feed it to a snake.

2991
02:07:57,550 --> 02:07:58,830
There's going to resell that.
Someone's gonna,

2992
02:07:58,870 --> 02:08:02,680
someone's gonna buy it or it might die 
because it hasn't eaten in 24 hours.

2993
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:03,573
I don't know.
And our other option is we give it to 

2994
02:08:06,011 --> 02:08:09,670
the chickens and they're crying and this
and at this point had you known that the

2995
02:08:09,671 --> 02:08:13,110
chicken was likely to eat this thing or 
I've seen them eat a mouse before.

2996
02:08:13,130 --> 02:08:14,740
Really?
They're fucking ruthless,

2997
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:20,050
ruthless.
Like I put that mouse down.

2998
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:20,913
It was not down on the ground for a 
fucking half a second when one chicken 

2999
02:08:25,301 --> 02:08:26,134
slammed it grow,
got it in his beak and the other 

3000
02:08:28,271 --> 02:08:30,210
chickens were chasing this chicken 
around the cit.

3001
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:34,570
The Hen house like this chicken couldn't
pause to try to eat this because all the

3002
02:08:34,571 --> 02:08:37,180
other chickens knew what had had and 
they were running around.

3003
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:38,620
He couldn't.
He couldn't stop.

3004
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:39,483
It was running and it's trying to eat it
and the other chickens are running with 

3005
02:08:42,071 --> 02:08:43,720
it and it was just.
I should've filmed it.

3006
02:08:43,721 --> 02:08:45,010
I had no idea to.

3007
02:08:45,010 --> 02:08:45,843
They're monsters.
They are with each other and they like 

3008
02:08:48,281 --> 02:08:50,520
to pick the shit out of each other and 
they pack everything.

3009
02:08:50,570 --> 02:08:51,403
Here's what's fucked up man.
They picked my daughter a couple of 

3010
02:08:52,801 --> 02:08:55,900
times and one time I almost killed one 
of them because it packed her face.

3011
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:58,090
And um,
my wife is like,

3012
02:08:58,091 --> 02:08:59,230
it doesn't know.
I go,

3013
02:08:59,231 --> 02:09:00,220
listen,
listen,

3014
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:02,980
it's trying to eat her.
It just can't.

3015
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,920
Do you need to get this in your head.
It's not that he doesn't know.

3016
02:09:06,070 --> 02:09:08,440
It knows she's alive and it's trying to 
fucking eat eater.

3017
02:09:08,620 --> 02:09:11,110
And if we held her down,
those chickens would eat her.

3018
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:12,130
She's like,
you just,

3019
02:09:12,140 --> 02:09:13,690
you,
you get crazy with this.

3020
02:09:13,691 --> 02:09:15,310
I go,
I'm telling you right now.

3021
02:09:15,311 --> 02:09:17,680
They are fucking dinosaurs.
They are cold blooded.

3022
02:09:17,810 --> 02:09:18,643
There they have,
they have the fucking brain of a pencil 

3023
02:09:20,531 --> 02:09:21,460
eraser.
Okay.

3024
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:23,590
Little tiny on the tip of your pencil.

3025
02:09:23,650 --> 02:09:25,680
That's how big their fucking brain is.
Walk.

3026
02:09:25,681 --> 02:09:26,410
Fuck.
Fight.

3027
02:09:26,410 --> 02:09:28,030
Exactly.
They'll eat everything.

3028
02:09:28,150 --> 02:09:28,983
They follow my wife around like she'll 
like lift up rocks and they dive under 

3029
02:09:31,571 --> 02:09:33,660
the rock to try to get worms and 
anything that's there,

3030
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:35,050
the little predators,
man,

3031
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:36,103
are straight up predators.
So when you see you like vegetarian fed 

3032
02:09:39,670 --> 02:09:40,503
doesn't,
those are good eggs and not doing any 

3033
02:09:41,621 --> 02:09:43,240
service to that.
They're omnivores,

3034
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:44,103
they're omnivores and they would eat 
meat all day long above grass if you 

3035
02:09:47,861 --> 02:09:48,694
gave it to them.
They like that more like my lawn is 

3036
02:09:50,741 --> 02:09:51,574
filled with grass and they pick up the 
grass and they eat all kinds of other 

3037
02:09:53,411 --> 02:09:54,244
stuff too.
And they eat the chicken food that we 

3038
02:09:55,601 --> 02:09:56,434
bought.
We tried to buy the most nutritious 

3039
02:09:57,581 --> 02:09:58,414
chicken food available.
There's some brands that are like more 

3040
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:02,410
more diverse and the the,
the,

3041
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:04,450
the food and the nutrients that are in 
them.

3042
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:07,360
But the bottom line is they abandoned 
all that shit.

3043
02:10:07,361 --> 02:10:10,000
When they see something live,
they'd try to eat living things.

3044
02:10:10,090 --> 02:10:10,923
That's what they want to do.
That's the thing we got to be scared of 

3045
02:10:11,771 --> 02:10:13,630
most is chickens.
They're going to get big,

3046
02:10:13,690 --> 02:10:14,630
which is lucky.
The little.

3047
02:10:14,770 --> 02:10:15,940
Yeah.
Well you ever heard of terror?

3048
02:10:15,941 --> 02:10:17,380
Birds like to tell people that all the 
time.

3049
02:10:17,381 --> 02:10:18,214
It's just like,
if you don't think that that cat 

3050
02:10:18,881 --> 02:10:19,714
wouldn't fucking eat you.
If it was just a significantly larger 

3051
02:10:21,101 --> 02:10:22,600
believe you'd have a different respect 
for,

3052
02:10:22,670 --> 02:10:23,503
oh fuck you.
For a the ammo and the idea that eating 

3053
02:10:25,331 --> 02:10:26,200
meat is.
Yeah,

3054
02:10:26,550 --> 02:10:27,410
dude,
fuck.

3055
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,533
Like a large mouth bass.
Your swimming pool big enough for large 

3056
02:10:29,911 --> 02:10:30,744
mouth bass teacher.
You're done like a group or have you 

3057
02:10:32,171 --> 02:10:35,120
ever seen those groupers and Florida?
They would eat a baby.

3058
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:38,360
One hundred percent gay babies floating 
around group would come up.

3059
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:40,970
There was a nutty video of a group or 
eating a shark.

3060
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:42,500
I saw.
Isn't that crazy?

3061
02:10:42,550 --> 02:10:45,360
I'm crazy.
The shark was like Three v swallowed it.

3062
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:49,190
Just put her into jumper.
Mammoth fucking animal.

3063
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:52,550
It's like a giant large mouth bass from 
the hobbit movie.

3064
02:10:52,551 --> 02:10:54,080
It's crazy.
They don't even seem real.

3065
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:55,333
I don't know how big they get,
but I think it's hundreds and hundreds 

3066
02:10:56,931 --> 02:10:58,310
of pounds that massively.
This.

3067
02:10:58,390 --> 02:10:59,720
Here it is.
These people,

3068
02:11:00,230 --> 02:11:01,063
they caught a shark and they put the 
camera in the water to film this group 

3069
02:11:04,521 --> 02:11:05,354
or that's coming up to the shark,
so they have a small shark on the hook 

3070
02:11:08,930 --> 02:11:09,763
and as they're reeling it in and they're
bringing it in and they see this video 

3071
02:11:13,401 --> 02:11:15,740
could use some editing and as they're 
reeling it in,

3072
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:18,070
they've got this shot.
It's not a small shark,

3073
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:20,660
it's about three feet long,
maybe even more.

3074
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:21,493
I might even be four feet and this group
or comes along and some mashes it as 

3075
02:11:25,521 --> 02:11:26,990
they're trying to get it out of the 
water.

3076
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:30,150
Look at this.
Boom says great.

3077
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:32,930
I mean that group has got to be two,
300 pounds.

3078
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:34,613
I don't know how big they get,
but I would assume they get to be like 

3079
02:11:36,651 --> 02:11:38,750
three or 400 pounds.
How big your group is,

3080
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:40,170
Jeremy?
Well now let's.

3081
02:11:40,171 --> 02:11:43,850
Let's end this with groupers.
Those they taste good though.

3082
02:11:44,050 --> 02:11:45,560
Do you ever have a grouper sandwich?
No,

3083
02:11:45,561 --> 02:11:46,394
I haven't.
I don't know if you would want to eat 

3084
02:11:46,941 --> 02:11:48,020
it.
Old One like that.

3085
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:49,420
Probably not.
Yeah,

3086
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:50,870
they get a little.
I don't know.

3087
02:11:50,871 --> 02:11:52,370
I don't know if that's the case with 
fish.

3088
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:54,320
I know it's definitely the case with 
fish.

3089
02:11:54,380 --> 02:11:55,340
Is it?
I go fishing.

3090
02:11:55,341 --> 02:11:56,840
You don't want to keep your 11 pound 
Walleye.

3091
02:11:56,841 --> 02:12:00,550
You want to eat the like a three and 
like smell really three pounds.

3092
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:02,393
Why?
I went wildlife fishing for the first 

3093
02:12:03,891 --> 02:12:07,950
time last year with good eating.
Anxious perch and yeah,

3094
02:12:07,970 --> 02:12:08,900
and Alberta.
Man.

3095
02:12:08,901 --> 02:12:11,660
How big they get two point five meters.
Eight feet.

3096
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:16,610
Oh my God.
They can weigh as much as 790 pounds.

3097
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:20,900
Holy fucking shit.
Wow.

3098
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:23,630
That is insane.
I had no idea.

3099
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:25,790
Eight feet.
That could eat you.

3100
02:12:26,210 --> 02:12:30,350
700 fucking pounds.
That is so crazy.

3101
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:31,580
Wow.
I did not know.

3102
02:12:31,581 --> 02:12:33,920
They got that big.
Oh my God.

3103
02:12:33,950 --> 02:12:36,770
Eight feet.
Imagine Shaquille o'neal.

3104
02:12:36,771 --> 02:12:40,340
A foot bigger than him is a grouper.
That's insane.

3105
02:12:40,570 --> 02:12:43,550
Look at the size of that thing is one 
with a dude.

3106
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:46,670
Oh my God.
This thing is bigger than the guy.

3107
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:48,800
Look at the little fishes thing on the 
other side of the guy going like,

3108
02:12:48,801 --> 02:12:49,634
fuck no,
I'm not coming.

3109
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:51,053
I was thinking I'd find you.
It's hoping that the group or like 

3110
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:55,160
taking chunks out of that guy and like 
leaves a little for him.

3111
02:12:56,150 --> 02:12:57,810
God,
ocean is awesome.

3112
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:59,950
The ocean is so amazing.
Deep Ocean.

3113
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:02,510
The more you learn about it.
I mean you see in Japan that massive.

3114
02:13:02,511 --> 02:13:04,270
A massive squid.
Yeah,

3115
02:13:04,271 --> 02:13:05,510
that's crazy.
The swimming.

3116
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:07,310
I don't want to swim anywhere near that 
fucking thing.

3117
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:09,200
That's a.
that's an evil Predator right there.

3118
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:11,030
You didn't know when it gets stuck in 
those tentacles.

3119
02:13:11,150 --> 02:13:13,640
Oh yeah.
They are really evil and they're so big.

3120
02:13:13,670 --> 02:13:14,503
They're the.
What's really nuts is that giant squid 

3121
02:13:16,101 --> 02:13:16,934
were just a myth and a couple of decades
ago they had no idea if they were real 

3122
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:21,583
like they had.
They had never caught one of these 

3123
02:13:22,731 --> 02:13:24,380
things on camera.
Now they have one.

3124
02:13:24,381 --> 02:13:27,310
It looked like it was in a base 
somewhere because it was really close to

3125
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:28,183
boats.
It was crazy to look to allowing people 

3126
02:13:29,871 --> 02:13:32,400
to swim in it.
Like they never caught one before.

3127
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:35,520
Like they didn't know if they were real 
then catching them.

3128
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:36,503
I wouldn't swim with that thing.
I want to have a catching them so 

3129
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:41,100
because they're catching them much more 
frequently now.

3130
02:13:41,190 --> 02:13:42,690
Like look at it,
look at the video of it.

3131
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,610
My God,
what an amazing,

3132
02:13:44,611 --> 02:13:47,730
amazing creature.
The entire body flexible.

3133
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:51,810
Nothing but a beak like as far as the 
only thing that's hard.

3134
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:56,040
Do you know,
they found evidence really recently of a

3135
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:58,260
gigantic,
some,

3136
02:13:58,290 --> 02:13:59,123
some sort of octopus type species that 
would be like a cracking their thinking 

3137
02:14:02,971 --> 02:14:03,804
by the size of the tentacles.
This thing would be 100 feet long and 

3138
02:14:06,751 --> 02:14:08,840
they found these enormous tentacles that
were like,

3139
02:14:08,841 --> 02:14:10,550
you know,
dinner plates and they're,

3140
02:14:10,551 --> 02:14:11,430
they're saying,
okay,

3141
02:14:11,431 --> 02:14:14,610
well this is what the myths of the crack
and I've always been.

3142
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:15,713
The crack was always this gigantic 
tentacled monster that would eat 

3143
02:14:18,511 --> 02:14:20,750
anything.
I look at that fucking well,

3144
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:22,860
it's hard to perspective when you see it
with a person,

3145
02:14:22,870 --> 02:14:25,920
you get a real good idea of how,
how enormous it is.

3146
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:28,470
But I think that thing is like 18 feet 
long or something crazy.

3147
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:29,903
But these crackings the.
There's nothing left of them when they 

3148
02:14:32,761 --> 02:14:33,594
die.
So what they found is a fossilized 

3149
02:14:35,161 --> 02:14:39,560
remains of the tentacles had dot when 
they went into died,

3150
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:41,940
the tentacles had left an imprint on the
ground,

3151
02:14:41,941 --> 02:14:42,774
on the bottom of the ocean.
And so that's the got the fossilized 

3152
02:14:45,241 --> 02:14:46,620
remains of these tentacles.
They're like,

3153
02:14:46,621 --> 02:14:49,280
Holy Shit.
And they realized,

3154
02:14:49,281 --> 02:14:49,711
well,
okay,

3155
02:14:49,711 --> 02:14:51,780
well this is where these myths come 
from.

3156
02:14:51,810 --> 02:14:53,400
This was a real,
a real creature.

3157
02:14:53,401 --> 02:14:58,401
It's amazing how little we know in terms
of what the deep ocean and has available

3158
02:14:58,411 --> 02:14:59,470
to it in terms of,
uh,

3159
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:00,683
of,
uh,

3160
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:01,410
animal life.
Oh,

3161
02:15:01,410 --> 02:15:03,000
it's crazy.
We're discovering stuff every day.

3162
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:03,953
Yeah.
They say we know more about the moon 

3163
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:06,150
than we know about the ocean.
Well,

3164
02:15:06,380 --> 02:15:07,530
it's,
it's,

3165
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:08,453
what is it?
Seventy percent of the earth or 

3166
02:15:09,331 --> 02:15:10,164
something like that.

3167
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:11,393
Something percent.
Some giant percentage of the earth is 

3168
02:15:12,991 --> 02:15:13,824
water and the ocean floor,
I think they've only examined like five 

3169
02:15:16,771 --> 02:15:18,760
percent of it,
which is amazing.

3170
02:15:18,770 --> 02:15:23,770
So 95 percent of this incredible,
essentially wild world.

3171
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:28,530
Meaning it is a wild world and it'll 
ultimately comes from the ocean.

3172
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:31,740
The ocean is what gives us life.
That's where we have to respect.

3173
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:33,270
Supposedly it all came from,
right.

3174
02:15:33,271 --> 02:15:36,480
We all started off somehow or another as
some little fucking fish thing.

3175
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:38,340
I got to watch more cosmos.
That's another thing.

3176
02:15:38,350 --> 02:15:39,990
I can't get enough.
I know,

3177
02:15:39,991 --> 02:15:42,210
right?
I'm so glad they brought that back with.

3178
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:43,770
Especially with Neil degrasse Tyson's.
Great.

3179
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:46,530
Great podcast too.
It's called startalk.

3180
02:15:46,770 --> 02:15:48,240
It's awesome.
It's really good.

3181
02:15:48,241 --> 02:15:49,074
Definitely check that out and it's all 
about a bunch of different subjects to 

3182
02:15:51,510 --> 02:15:52,343
like,
he had a really cool one with David 

3183
02:15:53,550 --> 02:15:54,383
Byrne from the talking hands about 
creativity and he's just a really 

3184
02:15:57,091 --> 02:15:58,860
interesting curious guy.

3185
02:15:58,890 --> 02:16:03,690
Neil degrasse Tyson had got a great 
demeanor and I liked the way they do the

3186
02:16:03,691 --> 02:16:05,400
cosmos with the,
with the sort of,

3187
02:16:05,410 --> 02:16:06,370
um,
the,

3188
02:16:06,410 --> 02:16:10,500
the imagination and the animation,
the animation.

3189
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:12,320
It's great.
It's awesome.

3190
02:16:12,330 --> 02:16:13,230
Great.
It's a very engaging.

3191
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:14,820
Um,
so we're good.

3192
02:16:15,030 --> 02:16:15,960
Anything else?
Yes.

3193
02:16:15,961 --> 02:16:17,260
All that safe.
