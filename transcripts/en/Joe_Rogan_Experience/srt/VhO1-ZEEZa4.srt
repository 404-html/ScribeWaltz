1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,380
Her freak bitches.
A lot of us right now,

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:09,381
we're going into alternate dimensions
via technology and hanging out there,

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,860
enjoying it,
experiencing the freedom,

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,100
uh,
from the confines of being constantly in

5
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:24,150
an infinitely located in whatever
physical space your body happens to be

6
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:29,151
inhabiting to suddenly remove that
weight and how I can pop these things on

7
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:34,581
and instantly translocate to some art
universe that some geniuses created.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,460
Fuck around.
Shoot Arrows,

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,670
wander through minecraft,
have sex with two girls who I always

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,680
apparently gonna throw out of my house
if they didn't fuck me.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,450
That's what the point is.
I have

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,420
never do that.
But in this universe,

13
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,550
I guess that's what I go.
Yeah,

14
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:59,790
so the kind of rapey what?
It's not rapey it's just like,

15
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,290
please,
I don't have money for the rent.

16
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,150
Can I suck your Dick?
Oh,

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,460
you know her idea.
Oh yeah,

18
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,070
you're not,
you're not raping her.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,040
It's not like,
look,

20
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,880
you got,
you got to give up some pussy or

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,840
otherwise I'm kicking you the street.
You could say it if you want into the

22
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:13,591
porn.
I mean,

23
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:15,330
you could say whatever you want.
Wait a minute.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,580
You have a microphone,
a microphone,

25
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,560
but you can talk to it if you want to be
a Weirdo,

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,490
but okay.
How long before you can talk to it,

27
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,710
how long before it talks back to you?
Well,

28
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,790
that's,
you're going to look,

29
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:31,140
you're looking at like a,
so we got to figure out a way to either,

30
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:36,141
I mean I imagine that probably exists in
some rudimentary way for some kind of

31
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:40,860
CGI style porn,
but to be able to like instantaneously

32
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:44,250
communicate with live video porn,
you're going to need some kind of ai

33
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,880
that I don't think we probably have just
yet or we are probably on the pr,

34
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,960
but yes,
that will add.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,890
It's come.
Oh,

36
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:53,220
that's definitely going to happen.
I've watched x Mokena again on the plane

37
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:55,280
the other day.
I watched it for the second tire.

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,460
That's cool.
It's just as good.

39
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,160
The second time.
That movie freaks me out,

40
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,420
man.
Why?

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,360
Because the girl's so beautiful and
she's so,

42
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,760
she's so attractive.
Like you,

43
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:09,570
you know that guy.
You could see as much as he knew that

44
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,960
she was a robot,
as much as he knew that he wasn't a

45
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:14,880
robot as much,
as much as he knew that she was

46
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:18,060
artificial,
he was in love with her and she was

47
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,260
amazing.
And it seemed like she cared about him.

48
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:22,110
And when she was talking to him for
real,

49
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:24,120
like when the lights went out and the
camera was down,

50
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:25,740
spoiler alert,
and she was like,

51
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:27,180
don't trust him.
I'm like,

52
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,370
this is like a real person,
a real person.

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,540
She's thinking like a person.

54
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,490
It's a person.
Yeah.

55
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,890
And he's like completely locked into
this idea that it's a person.

56
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,750
He's hypnotized.
It's a person.

57
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,800
I mean,
I don't,

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,700
this whole distinction between
artificial intelligence and intelligence

59
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,900
is the same as the distinction between
virtual reality and reality.

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,070
It's just like another human attempt to
be in control of something.

61
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,270
You want it,
you want to say,

62
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,800
Oh,
I'll tell you if this is fucking reality

63
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:53,634
or not.
Oh,

64
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,400
this is virtual reality.
This isn't reality.

65
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,240
Reality.
But it's like,

66
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,610
oh really?
So realities compartmentalized into

67
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:04,510
places where there's,
if something is created by a human,

68
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,550
oh no,
that's not real reality.

69
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:09,550
Even though humans are reality reality's
reality.

70
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,890
Intelligence is intelligence because the
intelligence is inhabiting something

71
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:17,800
that isn't the human vessel.
It goes back to what we were talking

72
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,030
about earlier,
what,

73
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:23,350
cause it's not in a fucking meat body
now it's artificial intelligence.

74
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,970
How is why intelligence is intelligence
and then Rosa parks.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,950
Yes,
but the Rosa Park one is real.

76
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,260
That's 100% real.
Is that when she,

77
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,000
that's when she got arrested.
You know,

78
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,560
she was,
a lot of people get that story wrong by

79
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:39,370
the way.
A lot of people think like she sat in

80
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:43,180
the front of the bus and then was asked
to move to the back of the boat.

81
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,350
Somebody else had done it before her.
Of course.

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,760
Of course.
Yeah,

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,593
of course.
Of course.

84
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,270
Anybody even the front of the bus part
is incorrect.

85
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,590
What part?
What is it?

86
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,740
It's very mean.
My new thing,

87
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:57,700
but I'm like a history dude.
There was a white section in the front,

88
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,940
right?
African American and a book in the bag.

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,710
At the time they called black or colored
section.

90
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,140
Uh,
she was in the colored section.

91
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,760
But what happened was if the white
section filled up and a white person

92
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,010
went back to the colored section,
sit down,

93
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,650
you still had to stand up and give them
your seat.

94
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,360
Really?
Yeah.

95
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,160
And then she wouldn't do it.
And that's,

96
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,890
that was the start of it.
Wow.

97
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,050
I did not know it.
I know it's a small,

98
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:23,831
uh,
you know,

99
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,790
but everyone says,
oh,

100
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,050
she wouldn't go to the back of the book.
It's like,

101
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,300
well that's even grosser.
I agree.

102
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,410
I agree.
It is.

103
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:33,590
Grocer just like literally just sitting
there and then just some guy just got

104
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:33,911
to,
yeah,

105
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:38,400
she's complying with your racist rules
and then you're like not racist enough.

106
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

107
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:42,770
So,
uh,

108
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,950
so then that's when she got arrested.
Parks original seat.

109
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,080
Wow.
You were totally right.

110
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,220
Am I correct?
Yeah.

111
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,810
Look at that.
What happened?

112
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,700
Ever seen,
I've never seen this picture is a

113
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:56,840
diagram like the Kennedy assassination.
It looks like the fucking magic bullet.

114
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,640
Rosa parks boarded the bus and sat in an
aisle seat in the designated colored

115
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,020
section.
College stops later.

116
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:08,021
The driver told parks and three other
blacks in her row to move to the back to

117
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:13,340
make room for a white man.
The three blacks move to the back.

118
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:17,390
Parks slid to an adjacent window seat,
refuse to move.

119
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,180
Wait,
so it was even,

120
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,380
it was like,
okay,

121
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:24,410
just so I'm clear on this,
now that I'm learning something,

122
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,190
I almost feel like now,
like they didn't even want him to have

123
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,370
to sit next to exactly what it was like.
That was an empty seat.

124
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,560
Yup.
That's exactly that,

125
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,620
right?
Am I reading that right?

126
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,420
You're absolutely reading it right.
It's interesting,

127
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,231
right?
That is.

128
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:38,030
It's awful.
That's awful.

129
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,470
That's another thing.
This,

130
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:42,590
not that long ago,
all these things that are not that long

131
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:44,660
ago.
The colored flag being on,

132
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,490
I mean the confederate,
the colored flag,

133
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,930
the confederate flag being on the state,
right.

134
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,480
Flag of Georgia.
This,

135
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,040
what year was this?
I want to say this is 60 what year

136
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,560
was it?
I want to say like 61 does that make

137
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,680
sense?
56 in the late fifties right.

138
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,420
Oh Wow.
I'm totally wrong.

139
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,680
Montgomery,
Alabama system was legally in the

140
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,523
graded.

141
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,120
Wow.
So good.

142
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,390
We learn a lot.
I learned a little something.

143
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:16,740
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

144
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,670
It's silly.
It's a stage photo then her right there.

145
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,010
Yeah.
Like how if there was a full bus and

146
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:25,170
there's a white guy behind her,
like how's this,

147
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,060
what's this photo from?
Oh,

148
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,860
I see.
So wikipedia photo,

149
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,840
they might've done that after the fact.
Right.

150
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,640
What's in the upper right hand corner?
What is that?

151
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,190
Is that the actual,
is that like no upper right hand corner,

152
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,960
upper right hand corner that,
yeah.

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,130
Mine never seen you yell at somebody
else.

154
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,073
Like I was like,
Yo,

155
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,320
this is the bus where it's at and that
you can actually go there and sit in an

156
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,340
extra of Obama there.
Oh Wow.

157
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,040
So they took the actual bus and put it
in a museum.

158
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,920
Well that's it.
Up in the above it someone should make a

159
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,530
tour bus so that,
hmm.

160
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,160
I think outkast or something.

161
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,850
Um,
yeah.

162
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,470
So this,
this tms thing,

163
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:02,710
transcranial magnetic stimulation
covered by Blue Cross,

164
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,790
huh?
Yeah.

165
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,380
Uh,
so yeah,

166
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,300
that's what like,
it's,

167
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,740
it's,
it was really,

168
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:09,880
really good.
Like I,

169
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,820
for a lot of my life I felt like I had
a,

170
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,680
I had like a,
I had like a,

171
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,290
a,
a thing like a,

172
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,380
it almost felt like a metal weight,
like a bit of like five pound weight on

173
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:25,030
my upper left forehead,
my left.

174
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,540
And then so I went to this whoa dude,
that sound is like an Mri sound.

175
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,940
Yeah,
that's what it is.

176
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,931
It is.
Yes.

177
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:37,540
It's basically the same exact magnet as
an MRI.

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,490
They do your hey,
yeah,

179
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,530
they put it on your head.
It's pretty simple.

180
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,470
The first time they measure it,
they have to get to the exact spot.

181
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,330
There's another video where my finger is
pulsing that you'll enjoy.

182
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,990
And what is it doing to you?

183
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,790
Like what's the benefit?
Uh,

184
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,470
it's basically magnetizing and
electrifying a,

185
00:07:56,471 --> 00:08:00,670
it's waking up basically dead,
uh,

186
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,700
synopsis according to them.
Really?

187
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,870
Yeah.
So it's,

188
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,390
it's waking up dead synapses and,
uh,

189
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,600
waking up dead,
waking them up so they're dormant.

190
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,610
Uh,
that's what they say.

191
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,160
Um,
you don't even look into it.

192
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,110
You like good.
Shoot me out.

193
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:16,944
Yeah.
What is it?

194
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,530
Can I do quarter one and this one time I
don't have kids,

195
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,393
man.
So I'm like,

196
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,290
yeah,
I don't give a shit,

197
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,150
whatever,
whatever it's going to cost me.

198
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:26,770
I'm happy to do it.
If you had kids,

199
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,440
you think you wouldn't do it?
I think if I had kids I'd be like,

200
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,090
you know,
sort of more,

201
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,930
more cautious about it.
Really.

202
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,230
Yeah,
probably.

203
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,420
Cause I'm not like reckless,
but I'm not,

204
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,520
I'm not like,
uh,

205
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,550
I do research.
It's also vague anyway,

206
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,150
the research,
it's also like we think it does it most

207
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,740
antidepressants,
they know,

208
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,160
they think they know what's happening.
They don't actually know.

209
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,930
Yeah.
That's a weird one.

210
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,440
Yeah.
When you think about how many people are

211
00:08:55,441 --> 00:09:00,030
prescribed these things,
and then there's not really a direct

212
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:01,770
understanding of how it impacts each
piece.

213
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,420
Each person,
like they'll tell you,

214
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,190
hey,
we'll try this medication and if it

215
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,480
doesn't work,
we'll try another one.

216
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,650
Yeah.
Does this one work?

217
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,230
We'll cycle through it.
And now how do you know if it's working

218
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:13,680
for you or if you're having a good time
in your life?

219
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:17,020
And so you're feeling better because
maybe you started a new relationship but

220
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:19,770
a new job and it's going well and hey,
it's just a,

221
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,663
everything seems pretty

222
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,980
dude.
I was on medications that made me

223
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,530
nauseous for a year and a half before I
was like,

224
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,350
you know what?
I literally thought I was nauseous

225
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,240
because I was eating too many
lifesavers.

226
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,450
Not even fucking kidding.
Literally,

227
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,260
I was like,
I gotta take it easy on these life

228
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,410
savers,
because every night I throw up on the

229
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,230
way to the laugh factory,
and then I realized like,

230
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,250
you know,
Neil,

231
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,870
you're taking a pretty high dosage of
Zoloft,

232
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:45,870
or you might want to just take it down a
notch.

233
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:55,570
Okay.
