1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,680
That lady or gentlemen,
Hermaphrodites freaks and Geeks,

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,990
all my friends' children.
Welcome to the podcast very much once 

3
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,120
again for tuning in.
We're here.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,470
My Road dogs,
Eddie Bravo and mad flavor.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,510
Let me adjust this camera because we 
can't see you.

6
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:24,680
Right?

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,270
What up,
what up?

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,980
Bam.
There we go.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,110
Tuning in.
They're tuning in.

10
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:36,020
Week number five,
week many,

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,560
many,
many,

12
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,090
many weeks.
And uh,

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,420
we've been having a good fucking time.
We got a good God downtown in Boston.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,610
And uh,
we were talking about this yesterday,

15
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,290
but we'll talk about it again just 
because Eddie's here.

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,680
It was fucking crazy when I asked on 
stage how many people listened to the 

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:50,870
podcast.
It's like this,

18
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:53,060
the ability that you have when everybody
went crazy,

19
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,340
it was like this huge audience and was 
like,

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,370
I'd say like 60 percent of them.
Seventy percent of them said they 

21
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:00,370
listened to the podcast.
It was crazy.

22
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,170
So it's only going to keep doing that.
So only as long as you make things that 

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,440
people think are interesting.
It's only going to like,

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,880
this is,
this is radio.

25
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,940
It says this,
this is just as powerful as any radio 

26
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:12,940
station that's ever existed

27
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,310
without the bullshit and drama and all 
that shit is just straight up talking.

28
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,910
What the fuck happened to that kid?

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,030
All right.
There we are.

30
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:28,070
I'm a terrible camera man.
Look as sharp.

31
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,190
Brian's off.
I'm thinking Brian is off in Ohio with 

32
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,120
his lady friend or right?
I mean the family.

33
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,150
Beautiful.
How can a good God damn time getting the

34
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:40,850
free gun as far with any problems with 
that?

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,050
Rob,
what's strange character?

36
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,210
It's funny.
You all understand Eddie Bravo in the 

37
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,351
10th planet.
Reality Show comes to light 10th planet 

38
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:53,351
Riverside,
which is respect.

39
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,840
It's funny because I was talking to you 
on the phone last week and you said that

40
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:01,841
you went to see a shitty movie,
but you're one of the few people like 

41
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:05,351
me,
that ticket shitty movie and make it 

42
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:05,351
work for us.
You know what I'm saying?

43
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:06,640
Like we really make it work for us.
We see what the bad points on.

44
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,650
You said you watched the expendables or 
whatever and it's so weird how we 

45
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:11,650
learned that from Paul Mooney.

46
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,520
We had a conversation once about when 
you're a comedian,

47
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,680
you should get entertained,
tell you something.

48
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,070
The last two weeks I've done something 
that has blown me apart.

49
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,810
I went to see a different form of 
entertainment.

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,870
I want to watch Eddie Bravo teach.
Oh yeah,

51
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,760
that's entertainment.
The way that place is,

52
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:28,180
the way you sit.
It's like a big fucking states.

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,340
Like if I had one man show,
I would do it there with the mats facing

54
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:36,341
everything and I still here and the 
first week he taught this move where 

55
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:41,140
you're hitting the guy and then you roll
and take his leg and the guy gives you 

56
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,140
an arm so you have three different 
options.

57
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,860
And then last week he was.
When you were there,

58
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,540
by the way,
you know the fucking movie.

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,430
It's got to let it go and you're hitting
them.

60
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:49,490
You're on his back.
So you take this leg and you hook double

61
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:54,491
hook on this leg and you pull over.
So he didn't take his arm from spider 

62
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:54,491
web.
Oh No,

63
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:54,660
no,
no truck.

64
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,210
Really cool.
Really cool.

65
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:59,060
But just the way that he was teaching.
I hope you remember that.

66
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,100
Come on dog.

67
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,800
If I didn't want my dog was just making 
shit up.

68
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,740
I thought you would know because in the 
beginning of the DVD,

69
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,970
you know,
because at that point you didn't really 

70
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,350
know the system at all.
That's the beauty of it is you were just

71
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:16,351
talking about night of the living dead 
and then I flip you with the butterfly 

72
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:19,531
hooks and then last week you start on 
the guys back with your two hooks in the

73
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,940
guy in the head.
He thinks you're going to choke them out

74
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,250
and you flip over.
You can say you got this leg,

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,070
you hook them with that,
take it to the truck,

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
baby.
You got the truck.

77
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,190
And it was really weird how I went home 
and it fucked with me that night I was 

78
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,330
doing to accommodate it affected you?
Like if it fucked up.

79
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,570
Like I thought about it when I left 
there and then I went the other night 

80
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,741
which was a very simple hold where it 
was controlling the guy with the under 

81
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:40,980
hook,
which you're really good at.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He said George Sada Rapa is in town.
He's been in town for the last two 

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,251
weeks,
so we've been focusing on over hook 

84
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:50,590
butterfly stuff to rubber guard,
so,

85
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,710
but the point being that the situation 
was that I was very intrigued while I 

86
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,610
was watching him,
which I don't get intrigued by Dick.

87
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,670
I didn't go see Avatar.
All these movies don't do well when 

88
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,151
someone's really good at tapping,
when someone's really good at something 

89
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:06,820
and really good at speaking about that.
Something that's always fascinated me,

90
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,090
how he walks,
he keeps it.

91
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,320
He doesn't like a standup comic.
He walks in a certain area so people 

92
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,440
have to look at it and he doesn't even 
know what he's doing.

93
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,480
He doesn't know how.
Just being him,

94
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:18,370
he commands attention.
You know?

95
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:21,310
He's not a big guy.
He's not a flamboyant guy,

96
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,290
but I couldn't take my eyes off.

97
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,190
Are you gay for Eddie?
Eddie?

98
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,210
I'm talking about what I learned this 
week,

99
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,350
so we just came out to us.
I'm supposed to go into the bucket.

100
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm supposed to go to the theater and 
see some fucking guy.

101
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:39,010
That's not funny and being at the but 
those guys are funny,

102
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,100
but I have went to see different in 
Jujitsu class and was very entertained 

103
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,900
them was very interesting and that was 
the whole point of this.

104
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,920
It wasn't about the UCB theater.
What the fuck is you that you really 

105
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,910
locked me in?
And it was very,

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,110
you know,
I've ever,

107
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:54,610
you know,
you locked me in all the time.

108
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,330
So you know that when you're onstage you
learn something.

109
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,900
You know how fucking much great shit I 
talk about you to everybody.

110
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,040
That's what I tell everybody is a 
ringing all the time.

111
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,460
You know what I'm saying?

112
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,580
Everybody recognizes game business 
originally with the 10th planet.

113
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:12,581
Kush.
Originally it was going to be the both 

114
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:12,581
of us,
but when joe was around I'm like,

115
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,700
why would I want to put the fucking 
camera on me and I'm just going to keep 

116
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:17,700
it on jelly,
but it's.

117
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,860
I can't really speak my mind anyways.
I like being really honest.

118
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,120
I can't really do that on other people's
feelings.

119
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,580
I can't really be that honest and Joey 
can just smash people.

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,200
I didn't say it.
I wonder if I didn't say it.

121
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,220
I wonder if dudes get upset at some of 
your predictions.

122
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Davis was Davis burned the kilt though.
He's got Marcus Davis.

123
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,810
Kenny Florian.
I fucking love you guys,

124
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,220
man.
You know my dogs.

125
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,350
You know what I'm saying?
This is our entertainment.

126
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,400
I didn't say shit.
No,

127
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,530
we just say listen to Kenny.
I picked Kenny Florian to when the 

128
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:54,920
youtube clip that discussing.

129
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,460
Oh,
check this out,

130
00:05:56,461 --> 00:06:01,461
but check this.
What we're talking about actually is 

131
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,620
probably on youtube right now.
I uploaded it about 73.

132
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,370
My fucking segway.
Right?

133
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,450
Can we play?
No,

134
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,470
we can't.
We can't.

135
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,500
All right.
You have to have two laptops to play.

136
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,700
A.
Brian is not here right now.

137
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:16,460
So I barely.
I barely know what.

138
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,220
I'm just navigating the strip.
Even with Brian hit a fucking thing,

139
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:19,970
you know?
Okay.

140
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,930
But anyways,
what we're talking about this,

141
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,460
this review we're talking about is 
actually just being released as we speak

142
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,960
right now.
It's 10th planet Kirsch,

143
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,770
episode 19 featuring Joe Rogan.
That's the one.

144
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:35,771
It's up like right this second probably.
And Joey fucking goes off and I got to 

145
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,440
put.
I got to put like a warning thing before

146
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,990
this.
The views of jelly karate do not reflect

147
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:43,640
the views of Eddie Bravo.
Right.

148
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,430
I got to put that up.

149
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,750
I didn't go off.
I love.

150
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,910
Let me tell you something.
You'll see.

151
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:54,911
You'll see what we mean.
It was funny because I said I read 

152
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:54,911
something that Dana had mentioned that 
what's his name,

153
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:57,200
choked.
And I started taking about Kenny Florian

154
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,270
and I started taking a bite and I said,
you know what,

155
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,170
how can I say that about a guy that I've
never tried what he's doing,

156
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,540
like this is to the port and point in my
life where I'm at.

157
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,580
I can never say somebody choked,
you know,

158
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:10,490
maybe you had a bad day or then I 
started thinking about here like six bad

159
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:11,170
days,
you know,

160
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,030
but I never said he choked her like 
that.

161
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,750
All I said was I will.
I said was he was the skinniest Jesus.

162
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Well,
people will see exactly what you said 

163
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:21,760
when they watched the episode last,
but it was,

164
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:21,760
you know what?

165
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,550
It's all fun and what it is for the 
people don't know what we're talking 

166
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,901
about.
Joey does this break down to the UFC as 

167
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:31,180
joey karate,
who's a Cuban black belt and it's 

168
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,611
probably even if you're not a UFC fan,
it's probably the funniest fucking 

169
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:33,790
thing.
You walk in the Internet,

170
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,860
the funniest possible,
most entertaining reviews of UFC 

171
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,440
previews and review.
Sometimes we review a show.

172
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,010
Sometimes there's is nothing out there.
Fuck Espn,

173
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,190
fuck all that shit.
There's no body that brings the fire 

174
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:54,860
like Joey.
All that Shit's entertaining to a point,

175
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:59,861
but I don't know how many times I 
fucking turned it off halfway through 

176
00:07:59,861 --> 00:07:59,900
mma live and half.
It's just,

177
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,170
it's when you hear joey do it,
fuck you want it to last 30 minutes and 

178
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,930
I'm always find three or three and three
might pick some money.

179
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,610
You understand it because I've learned 
from these guys and I know what it is to

180
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:11,210
get beat up.

181
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,420
So I watched these fights and that's how
I picked the things that I've been like 

182
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,510
two other three lately with the two key 
matchups always been money,

183
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,360
so I'm not that fucking bad.
No,

184
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,170
you're very good.
You're very accurate with it.

185
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,290
I don't want him to see that many guys 
talking about fights and analyzing 

186
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:26,290
fights,
you know,

187
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,911
I don't like.
There's not a lot of guys I like to 

188
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:30,911
listen to.
Yeah.

189
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,160
You know what I,
you know,

190
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,360
I respect everybody out there doing to.
Personally I don't get nearly as much 

191
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:43,361
insight from the,
from like any articles or any 

192
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:47,171
commentators I get it from,
from mma forums I think do have more 

193
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:49,460
opinions and better opinions and points 
of view on MMA forums.

194
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:54,461
Yeah,
and there's some very good writers as 

195
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:57,791
you're right on the underground,
there's guys who are running the 

196
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:57,791
underground,
you read their shit and like this guy is

197
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:57,791
a fucking author.

198
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,490
I mean you might as well be writing for 
a magazine.

199
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:04,491
This is like really well written,
a really well written breakdown of the 

200
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:04,491
event of,
of a guy's performance.

201
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,770
That to me,
I just because a guy has a job with 

202
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,981
Yahoo,
does it make them more credible than 

203
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:14,390
mcfuck stick one on the underground?
They're just human beings just right and

204
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,000
they need to be official on ESPN DOT 
com.

205
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:23,001
To me,
I'm a interacting with people in the 

206
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:23,001
underground and getting someone's 
opinion.

207
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:26,600
You get a bit more insight as to how 
fights going to go down from that and I 

208
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,910
think than any of the websites online,
you know,

209
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,070
the one time I do like hearing what a 
fighter actually has to say about a 

210
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,561
fight the one time when they're talking 
about stuff that the public and me 

211
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:40,970
included really don't know about what's 
really going on in that fucking cage.

212
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,850
You know what I mean?
Very few people experience fighting in 

213
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,061
front of the fucking world.
So when a guy is breaking down a fight 

214
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:50,330
and they see something,
a chink in that guy's armor,

215
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,340
like he folds or you know,
like maybe fighters can after awhile 

216
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,640
some fighters are known as folders,
right?

217
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:58,600
They just fold under the pressure,
you know,

218
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,620
and I'm a fighter,
see that quicker than the average 

219
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,080
person.
So I like that kind of incentive.

220
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,110
Yeah.
There was a time when I was doing 

221
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,341
commentary with Randy and I'm a dude got
poked in the eye and the referee went 

222
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:10,780
over to him and he said,
Kenya,

223
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,880
see?
And he's like,

224
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:12,590
man,
I dunno,

225
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,320
I dunno.
10.

226
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,150
Randy got angry.
Randy goes,

227
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:17,160
you never tell them you can't see.
He goes,

228
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,200
if he tells him he can't see it means he
doesn't want to fight.

229
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,520
And I was like,
whoa.

230
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,280
He got like really intense,
like his crazy,

231
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,060
like,
you know,

232
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,330
a competitive drive came out when he was
discussing this other guy.

233
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,450
That's fascinating.
Yeah.

234
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,600
That's my plan.
Yeah.

235
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,580
I don't want to hear like a bunch of 
analysts to sit around going,

236
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:34,430
what are you going to do?
Is Click weird.

237
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:36,570
Has Go to keep the folks turned and shut
up.

238
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,160
Shut up.
Stop it.

239
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Stop it.
I want to hear you want to call Mama 

240
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,190
Man,
the caveman.

241
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,340
Geico.
Take down ground and pound.

242
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,540
It's all happening,
dog.

243
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,100
You ain't stopping it.
That's what I want.

244
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,610
I want to hear that kind of stuff.
I do enjoy inside amendment though.

245
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,530
I watch that shit all the time because 
I'd run into some core fighter.

246
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,780
I'm a bus route and fat fucking to the 
test article in the craziest way.

247
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,040
You know what I mean?

248
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,780
Pause is insane.
It's an insane man.

249
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,030
Hosts the fucking show.
It's hilarious.

250
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,920
We flew to Boston on the same plane.
We're on the same flight as fuck.

251
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,530
One of the nicest guys I've ever met is 
super crazy nice.

252
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,430
But he's also crazy so on the planet.
Right.

253
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:25,431
So bosses on the plane and he goes up to
use the restroom and one of the ladies 

254
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:26,400
that's working for the plane is like,
do you,

255
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,910
are you here for the wrestling thing?
You,

256
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,300
you know?
And he's like,

257
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:30,720
uh,
yeah,

258
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,940
it's mixed martial arts.
We're there for mixed martial art,

259
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:37,941
you know,
he's talking to and she tells him that 

260
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:38,520
her husband has hands that he or her 
boyfriend,

261
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:43,521
his hands that he had registered as a 
deadly weapon and boss became obsessed 

262
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,090
with this bus is like,
this is not true.

263
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,620
You know,
I told her bullshit,

264
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,890
you know,
boss is telling me that he told her 

265
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:51,890
bullshit.

266
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:51,890
We get off the plane.
He was still telling.

267
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,920
She's telling me her boyfriend's hands 
are registered as a deadly weapon.

268
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,060
I'm like,
no fucking way.

269
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,450
It was like super amped up about this.
Oh yeah.

270
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I mean,
I listened to some of the shitty set on 

271
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,000
my God,
he's got like at least 15 to 20 classic 

272
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:12,871
lines like you want to put that shit on 
a loop and then on top of this crazy 

273
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:14,050
shit,
bad ass fighter.

274
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:19,051
I mean he was one of the,
one of the premier strikers in MMA 

275
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:22,710
during his era,
like when he took out two Yoshiko Soka 

276
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,890
wash that fucking fight.
Watch that fight where he wanted the 

277
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,100
title.
He's a bad motherfucker don't.

278
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,120
That was actually one of the title.
That was the first fight he had in the 

279
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,710
UFC on the posters that said the world's
greatest martial artists.

280
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,830
That's how they were bringing him in as 
the world's greatest martial artists.

281
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,970
And pause just fucked up to Yoshi Osaka.
Just blast and him like.

282
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,660
There wasn't very many dudes who were 
striking like that in the UFC,

283
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,670
but is fucking tough.
The toughest fuck boss was a savage man.

284
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:52,720
His He's attack man.
He could kick so fucking hard.

285
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,490
I man,
when he first brought and pancreas,

286
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,620
all these dudes were kind of doing the 
same kind of thing.

287
00:12:56,621 --> 00:13:00,340
The pancreas is the open hand slaps,
you weren't allowed to punch and there's

288
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:02,140
a lot of dudes that weren't kicking very
good.

289
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,170
They just were kinda like,
they take a guy down and dive on leg 

290
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,080
locks because they all these shin pads 
and these shoes on,

291
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,750
like you can grab a hold of a dude's 
feet pretty easy and a lot of dudes were

292
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:15,751
doing leg locks,
boss route and came out of nowhere 

293
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,690
blasting dudes with kicks.
Just uhm,

294
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,910
you would see them hit these guys.

295
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,740
They'd be like,
what the fuck is he doing?

296
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,780
And the palm strikes these Japanese 
guys,

297
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,440
they didn't have that.
We just slapping each other and 

298
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,440
grappling.
He said,

299
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,440
wait a minute,
we could slap.

300
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,330
How about a fucking slap you really 
fucking hard.

301
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:34,000
So he came in and he was fucking iron 
palming.

302
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,450
What he was doing was boss could pull 
his hand way back.

303
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,690
So he was basically just punching you 
with this.

304
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,830
He was using all his punch techniques,
but he was hitting you with the,

305
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:44,440
the,
you know,

306
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:49,441
the meat of your hand,
which really is better because it 

307
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:49,600
doesn't hurt your knuckles.
Your hands don't break.

308
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,050
You can hit some shit really hard like 
that.

309
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,860
He was not going to not allow what these
slabs.

310
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:58,861
The japs were crush anybody out.
But upper cut slaps knocking dude 

311
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:02,701
senseless.
You know what's crazy is I went to 

312
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:05,470
Amsterdam with boss route in 2011.

313
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,640
I commentated for a show called too hot 
to handle and Holland while I was 

314
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,730
working for King of the cage and pride 
I've fucking hired me.

315
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,030
So we're all on the same flight.
We're all in st flight.

316
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,580
He lived in La and this is when he was 
crazy as fuck.

317
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,160
I'm not going to get into detail what 
happened.

318
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,060
I don't want to bus them out,
but he's known as a crazy wild man.

319
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,090
Yes.
On the fucking plane was a crazy wild 

320
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,391
men on the plane and I can't get into 
details but God dammit when we get to 

321
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:34,800
and we partied all fucking.
I was.

322
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I have about 100 pictures of me and all 
fucked up in Holland.

323
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,760
I can't even begin to tell you.
Do you remember any of it?

324
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,320
I remember all of it.
Well,

325
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:52,321
I remember a lot of shit thanks to 
pictures because we took a lot of 

326
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:52,321
pictures and then you watch the pictures
of us.

327
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:54,860
How your memories become memories of the
pictures.

328
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,680
You actually remember that those are 
your memories.

329
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:58,390
The picture.
Well,

330
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,150
memories are okay.

331
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,350
Relevant.
You know if you use them,

332
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,870
if it's a memory that's never going to 
come up.

333
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,900
It's really hard to retrieve if it 
doesn't have any emotional like bearing 

334
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,171
in your life.
Like I have memories from my early 

335
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:12,171
childhood because they were like strong 
moments.

336
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:14,370
That meant something to me.
I learned something from that experience

337
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,220
but like a regular memory just hanging 
out with somebody.

338
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,170
How long do you remember that?
For?

339
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,870
Good memories.
I remember a lot of shit.

340
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,540
As I get older I feel like I have less 
room on my hard drive.

341
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,770
I feel like I got an old hard drive dump
stuff,

342
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:30,300
but I do remember the important stuff.

343
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,810
I got a question for you,
Joe.

344
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,340
What do you think out of everything 
you've heard and about pancreas?

345
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,990
I mean,
what do you think?

346
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,100
I don't know what to think,
but Ken Shamrock told me,

347
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,290
Ken Shamrock told me,
came out of his mouth and all those 

348
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,071
pancreas fights were worked.
Never set up except except for when 

349
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:53,230
foreigners fought each other.
They would just let them fight.

350
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,830
Wow.
That's when it was Japanese against a 

351
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,230
foreigner.
Like he said he was.

352
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:04,290
He actually worked for the Japanese.
He was in pancreas as their American to 

353
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,310
fight so they can mix it in with the 
European.

354
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,720
That's what he said.
He said,

355
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,140
I was brought in.
You got to be really good at the same 

356
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,140
time because he said he was.
You had to be really,

357
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,020
really good because you had to,
you know,

358
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,040
if you had to have.
They asked you to take them to the later

359
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:23,041
rounds or whatever,
take them late into the fact you got to 

360
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:23,041
be good enough to.

361
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:23,620
Cause sometimes the foreigners didn't 
know they were fixed.

362
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,930
He said the foreigners didn't always 
know,

363
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,260
but we would control it like we were.
So the foreigners,

364
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,970
you'd have to make sure just didn't 
knock them out.

365
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,190
He sounded with him that we're trying to
create characters and do different shit.

366
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,010
What they do with the phone or got hurt.
Did this is just all.

367
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,530
I don't know if this is true or not.
I don't know about gambling.

368
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:42,670
Is that what it is?
I Dunno,

369
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
but it's fights.
I mean,

370
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:45,190
if it's all about predicting the 
outcome.

371
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:47,830
Is it like pro wrestling with fighting?
I think it was.

372
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:52,270
I think it was a half pro-wrestling half
real.

373
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,340
You know what I mean?
I think that's a pancreas,

374
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,240
but I don't know.
Man.

375
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:56,850
This is what Ken shamrock.
I don't know.

376
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,840
I wouldn't know.
I wouldn't know it because I do know one

377
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:01,740
thing that fucking frank shamrock 
against Alan goes,

378
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,340
that shit was real.

379
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,100
That was pancrase was.
And that was real as fuck.

380
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:11,101
Do you remember that at all?
Alan goes was all over frank shamrock.

381
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,180
You could if you grabbed the rope,
if you got to let go of the hold and 

382
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,760
start again.
So you're a fucking hold of.

383
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:22,030
You can grab the rope.
So Alan goes,

384
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,540
was over frank shamrock.
Thanks.

385
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,450
I'm like,
just started greg.

386
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:26,560
He had,
she was so green,

387
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:30,310
he really didn't know Jujitsu that well.
He was just a real natural athlete,

388
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:31,420
powerful,
strong.

389
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,450
He was always explosive.
He was just a fitness fucking 

390
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:36,450
powerhouse.
And he knew some,

391
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,450
some,
some shit from Ken Shamrock,

392
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,730
but he wasn't that good at that point.
And Alan goes,

393
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:43,070
was all over him and if it wasn't for 
the ropes he would've fucking um,

394
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,300
but at the end,
frank shamrock guide them in a fucking 

395
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,310
foot lock dude and goes,
couldn't reach the any fucking jacked

396
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,960
him and broke his ankle.
Really?

397
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,820
Yeah.
But it was like a draw I think.

398
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:57,390
I don't remember exactly if there were,
if it was a disqualification,

399
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:58,860
I don't know.
There was something at the end.

400
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,220
I don't know who won,
but I do know Alan gross was all over 

401
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,220
him,
but he got saved at Frank Shamrock.

402
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,951
I'm saving the ropes.
And then at the end he got them in an 

403
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:09,030
ankle lock man and an allen goes,
didn't defend ride and he broke it.

404
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,970
He screams,
screams.

405
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,020
Oh,
surprised that frank shamrock retired.

406
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,250
I was surprised commentator for the 
strikeforce,

407
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,970
but he hasn't retired.
He said he retired.

408
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:22,500
He had a big,
a big dude.

409
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,410
He retired.
He had a big ceremony,

410
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:29,950
stood in the middle of the octagon and 
about how many times as he retired.

411
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,480
Many times I'll honest.
Exactly.

412
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:41,330
Farewell Tours.
Technically he's had several farewell 

413
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:41,330
tour,
barrel.

414
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,450
Okay,
so you think,

415
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:44,760
can you think frank shamrock getting in 
that cage,

416
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:46,530
just bow and everybody's just publicity 
stunt,

417
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,450
but eventually he's going to come back 
and make it.

418
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:49,290
Look.
It's a really big deal.

419
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:54,291
Who's coming back?
I'm not going to say it was a publicity 

420
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:54,291
stunt because maybe he believes he's 
really retiring,

421
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,580
but I believe and he hasn't made that 
much money.

422
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,610
He hasn't made that much money and you 
have all these boxes that have made 

423
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:01,620
gazillions and boxing and happens all 
the time.

424
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,680
All of these five bucks than lead 
because though you get used to the 

425
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:06,680
money.
Damn.

426
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:06,680
If I fight again,
that could fight for like,

427
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,540
dude,
I can make $500,000.

428
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,570
That means a lot to these guys.
These guys aren't rich will come back.

429
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,130
You know what I mean?
How will always come back?

430
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,780
I think he's coming up.
He's in his late thirties,

431
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,100
I believe he's about 37.

432
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,430
You know,
he even guys with millions come back for

433
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,470
the money and he didn't make no.
Well,

434
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,140
he's a smart guy though.
He hadn't to them.

435
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,620
I'm not saying this,
I'm not saying he's.

436
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,850
I think he could do anything and I think
if he decides that he doesn't want to 

437
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:31,850
compete anymore,
why should you compete?

438
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,130
If it's not as hard anymore and he feels
like his performances reflect that,

439
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,320
why not just step down?
Why not stop doing it?

440
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:42,321
If you can get over it.
The real problem with fighters is at a 

441
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:44,901
certain point in time,
your self esteem and your self worth 

442
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:46,860
evolves completely around your ability 
to fight and beat people up and when you

443
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,540
can't do it anymore,
you feel like a loser.

444
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,610
You know?
A lot of guys,

445
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,470
they don't even know who they are when 
they stopped competing because it's such

446
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:57,471
an intense experience that a giant chunk
of their life is dedicated to getting 

447
00:19:57,471 --> 00:19:58,710
really good at it,
to getting good at fighting.

448
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,710
Their whole life revolves around their 
fighting and then when they're not 

449
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:03,710
fighting,
it's like they're lost.

450
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,160
Like when I was doing comedy and I was 
sucking,

451
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,960
one of the best things that happened to 
me is I tore my acl and the reason being

452
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:14,961
is I couldn't train.
I couldn't do anything and I certainly 

453
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:14,961
couldn't fight and I needed an 
operation,

454
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:18,270
but it took competing as an option away 
from me.

455
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,270
I was 21 years old and it took it away.
Now I was like,

456
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,100
I can't compete anymore,
but my legs fucked.

457
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,130
Okay,
so now I do have to concentrate in the 

458
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:28,460
next phase of my life because otherwise.
The thing about martial arts was,

459
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,590
this is the only thing I'd ever done 
that was I was good at.

460
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,310
So I would do other things that suck 
out.

461
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,690
I'm like,
but I'm good at this.

462
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,620
What the fuck am I doing?

463
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,700
Why am I,
why am I,

464
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,010
why am I getting away from this?
My brain would be like,

465
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:39,660
you don't want to do something.
It'd be terrible at it.

466
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,210
Do something to be good at it,
even if there's no fucking money in it.

467
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:43,860
No future in it,
you know,

468
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,570
you,
you,

469
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:45,840
you can get really,
really,

470
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:49,480
really attached to the,
of who you are and being a fighter,

471
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,730
it's very difficult for those guys to 
step away.

472
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,470
You know,
you can call it the glory.

473
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:56,290
Everybody says the glory.
It's far more complicated than that.

474
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:01,291
It's who they are.
It's all of a sudden their life is not 

475
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,651
wrapped around training camps and 
preparing and improving your skills to 

476
00:21:04,651 --> 00:21:08,551
face the next level and to get to the 
top and you get your title back once 

477
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:09,250
you've lost it and you know,
it's not that anymore.

478
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,020
Now it's just,
you're just a regular dude.

479
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,310
Well,
if you were just a regular dude,

480
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:14,020
there's nothing sad about being a 
regular dude,

481
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,350
but I guess if you're a fighter and 
you'd go to become just being a regular 

482
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,600
dude,
for a lot of them,

483
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,850
it's just too much to handle.
They don't want them to normal life.

484
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,110
They're wired for fucking craziness.
No,

485
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,800
they're wired for that extreme 
experience.

486
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,110
That shit's hard to walk away from it,
Huh?

487
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,970
I mean,
nothing could feel better than beating 

488
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,400
someone's like winning the belt in the 
UFC

489
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,220
main card when chocolate domains those 
arms back.

490
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:42,340
And I mean,
what feels better than that?

491
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,370
Yeah.
I mean we're the number one guy on the 

492
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:47,370
planet.
Chuck would do that.

493
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,740
Throw his arms back.
It looks like he's got like the whole 

494
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:51,740
fucking like he should be going,
right?

495
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,920
Yeah.
Like there's like a lightening bolt.

496
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,400
Of course you get addicted the Bat.
You need that though.

497
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,890
When he smashed Tito in,
you know,

498
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,900
and after it was over,
he was so fired up because Tito had 

499
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,701
talks so much shit.
Chuck is like the nicest guy in the 

500
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:11,290
world,
but if you talk shit,

501
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,890
chuck Liddell is the last person you 
want to talk shit because he just wants 

502
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,431
to take it out on you.
He wanted to take it out on Tito's so 

503
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:23,011
bad.
And when he knocked him out and he 

504
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:23,810
fucking threw his arms back,
like you could literally,

505
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,030
it was like,
it was like that.

506
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:27,730
It was like a black hole was opening up.
Do you get there?

507
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:30,060
When did I tell you this story?
About a checklist,

508
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:34,420
Dell party in and Dana Dana's lawyer or 
something,

509
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:37,670
grabbing some chicks ass.
They tell that story and all that shit.

510
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,640
Should you be telling us?
Um,

511
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,860
I don't know the guy's name.
And so it doesn't matter.

512
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:44,970
It was just a guy.
So.

513
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,590
Well,
did he do something that can get them in

514
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:47,530
trouble?
No,

515
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,240
no,
no,

516
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,310
no,
no,

517
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,710
no,
no,

518
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,620
no,
no,

519
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,390
no,
no,

520
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:59,391
no.
What happened is where we're at some 

521
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:01,470
club in vegas excess or some shit and 
it's like Dana Lorenzo,

522
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,480
Chuck's.
They're like,

523
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,670
man,
this guy that's got on top of the lawyer

524
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:06,230
Guy,
one of.

525
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,910
They have a bunch of lawyers.
So a lawyer for something.

526
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,010
A little guy.
He's all sitting there.

527
00:23:11,011 --> 00:23:15,150
We're all at a table and right next to 
the next table is straight baller.

528
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,010
Like he had to be a rapper or like.
Because he was a straight making it rain

529
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,540
on what?
It was funny he was.

530
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,230
Wait a minute,
dude,

531
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:24,690
that was there.
This guy that got mouthy with chuck?

532
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,730
Yes.
Yes.

533
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,330
Remember he started throwing up.

534
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,820
It was funny.
He was the dude next to us was throwing 

535
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:32,820
up ones.
The ones with landing on our table,

536
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,670
we have billionaires there.
Nobody's picking up the phone to me 

537
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,280
once.
They're just all over our feet.

538
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,300
Make it because it's just so.
Anyways,

539
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,770
I got loud and mouthy.
No,

540
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:44,070
no,
no,

541
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:44,460
no,
no.

542
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,500
That.
He had a of girls in that the rapper 

543
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,391
guy,
it was just him by himself with a bunch 

544
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:54,071
of chicks at his table and we're right 
next to him and I'm sitting there like 

545
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:54,510
looking at all the girls going,
God damn,

546
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,640
there's this guy has got a lot of girls.
Like what the,

547
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,800
what does he do?
Right.

548
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,130
And I think,
I think I don't know what he was an 

549
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,621
athlete or something probably so coke 
and the lawyer that was sitting next to 

550
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:09,971
me and we're both looking over.
We're both looking over at all the 

551
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:09,971
chicks and I'm going,
God damn,

552
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:09,971
he's got some hot ones.

553
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:15,130
And the lawyer guy reaches over at 13.
One grabs the chicks ass and the girl 

554
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:17,000
turns around and goes,
who the fuck did that?

555
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,250
And the lawyer pointed at me.
He said,

556
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,330
me,
I go,

557
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,650
Whoa,
wait a minute,

558
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:23,450
wait a minute.
You keep up this guy's name,

559
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:24,900
who I don't know his name.
I don't know.

560
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,620
I don't have no idea who he was,
but he was with.

561
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,090
He was with everybody.
Just grab the girl's ass and then the 

562
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,590
girl goes,
who grabbed my ass?

563
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,790
He goes,
he pointed at me.

564
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,570
I go,
dude,

565
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,700
fuck you.
I didn't grab no girl's ass.

566
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,150
Fucking point.
He pointed at me.

567
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,640
Right,
so find who this guy is.

568
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,790
So that girl grabs the fucking athlete.
Dude comes over and he gets right in his

569
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,420
fucking face and he's right there 
saying,

570
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,470

shake it.

571
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,150
Lawyer guy tries to shake his hand,
goes like,

572
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,020
fuck you shake it out.

573
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,300
You grab her fucking asshole.
Fuck your prayer.

574
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,280
He's like running this place because let

575
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:01,730
Let's,

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,710
let's talk.
Fuck your hand man.

577
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,090
Fuck your hand.
And he goes,

578
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,330
let's just talk this because I'm going 
to fuck you up right here.

579
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,630
And then why this is happening.
Fucking Patrick Calls Chuck or Dana 

580
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,470
calls or Lorenzo,
one of them they call chuck chuck just 

581
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,470
hanging out on the other side of the 
table.

582
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,730
He looks over the go.
Chuck handle that Shit,

583
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,770
Chuck.
Weird fucking too.

584
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,810
He went right into that guy's face.
So what the fuck you going to do?

585
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,750
He didn't even know what the fuck 
happened and the guy starts going trying

586
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:31,130
to shape chuck's hand.

587
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,550
Chuckles.
Fuck you.

588
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,110
Fuck with anybody here.
I'm going to fucking kill you.

589
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:38,090
It did.
I wait a minute.

590
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:43,091
You show that.
That's what he said because you weren't 

591
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:43,091
right there though.
I was there with screaming at them.

592
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Yeah.
And the guy was trying to shake chucks 

593
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,720
and chuck was like,
I'll chuck since it seemed to me a 

594
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:49,740
little bit more,
less intense than that.

595
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:55,050
The guy was definitely very aggro,
but chuck did get in his face to chuck 

596
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,060
out riding.
Shut them down,

597
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,310
fucking registered with the FBI.
There's only black guys in that cousin.

598
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,390
Do you ever noticed that white karate 
guys and that was.

599
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,790
That didn't exist when I was a kid 
growing up.

600
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,850
If you were black and you will talked 
about Bruce Lee was always that black 

601
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:12,850
guy.
I said,

602
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,061
listen,
I got a cousin who's a black belt who's 

603
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:16,840
got his,
has registered with the tail,

604
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,360
actually have your hair.
Only black guys have used exactly maybe 

605
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,540
20 years ago.
I think if you had a.

606
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,750
I think if you had a black belt in 
karate and some states still your hand.

607
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,680
I say that's ever been the case,
but you never heard about that.

608
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:32,120
I've heard about that.
People heard about it,

609
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:33,970
but it's not real.
It's just things that people make up.

610
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,500
I don't think there's any place that 
makes you register.

611
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:41,501
Your hands is deadly weapon closet.
Almost positive 100 percent we got on.

612
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,450
It was very short.
This is not true.

613
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,460
No.
It just looked very upset.

614
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,810
What professional fighter and something 
ever goes down.

615
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,500
You always lose because that's the case.
That's not necessarily the case.

616
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:01,260
That's Roger Work at thing.
Everybody thinks he was in the right.

617
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:05,910
That guy that knocked out that chicken.
Things have changed now I think 20 years

618
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:06,960
ago.
That was something.

619
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:11,961
There was some states that's a video.
There's a video of that guy being an 

620
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:12,450
aggressive douche bag.
So is that.

621
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:15,930
That's where the evidence has card off 
in Texas?

622
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,040
Yeah.
Well the guy,

623
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,700
the guy punched this chicken the face 
like it's the beginning of the video and

624
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:25,701
the guy just whoever's filming it looks 
like he just got lucky and caught this 

625
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:26,020
on tape.
But this big black dude,

626
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,700
he's a fucking like a quarter.
What's going on here?

627
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,430
Just hold it like a mic.
No,

628
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,010
not in the mood.

629
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:36,070
I hope a relaxing big big guys like 2:50
fucking giant muscles walks up to this 

630
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:42,021
chicken.
Just blasts or in the face and sucker 

631
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:42,021
punched her.
And everybody's like,

632
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:42,690
what the fuck?
But the dude so big,

633
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:47,691
nobody wants to do anything.
Well Roger character gets right up to 

634
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:47,691
the guy who goes,
hey man.

635
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:47,691
And he's got his hands up like this man 
band.

636
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:49,830
You just knocked out girl.
And the guy's like,

637
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:52,560
I'm not got any pitch at one.
I'm not your bitch ass out.

638
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,500
And the guy took his shirt off.
So Roger where that goes.

639
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:56,730
All right.
I guess we're going,

640
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,760
Brad,
where he takes his shirt off and there's

641
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,860
a lot of scrambling the camera.
It's tough to see what's going on,

642
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,020
but seconds later,
maybe four,

643
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,050
maybe five,
the dudes unconscious on the ground and 

644
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:09,060
roger were just beaten down on him.
Just Blab,

645
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:09,360
blab.

646
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,170
I mean,
it's like Karma,

647
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,420
like a movie.
It's like a.

648
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,290
he's an action hero.
He's like Spiderman.

649
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,560
He just blast this dude out of nowhere 
and they all got it on video and you 

650
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,600
can't say anything because the guy hit a
check.

651
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,690
It's like the perfect scenario is like,
here's a guy using his martial arts for 

652
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,870
good.
Unquestionably.

653
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,020
I mean,
he's in a place where a guy assaults a 

654
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,690
woman and does it,
hits her with a sucker punch.

655
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,020
He confronts the man with his hands up 
in a passive way like this.

656
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:34,890
Like,
hey man,

657
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,630
what the fuck?
You just knocked out a girl like,

658
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,870
surely it's got to be a reason for this,
you know?

659
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:39,230
Uh,
yeah,

660
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,980
that girl killed my mother.
You know what I'm saying?

661
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:41,640
You know,
you never know.

662
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,200
He's like,
I'm not a bitch ass.

663
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:45,810
I want,
I'm not your bitch ass out to roger were

664
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:47,340
to kick his ass and it's all on video.

665
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,530
I love it.
Roger worth the captain.

666
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:50,920
Save a hoe.
Fuck.

667
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,780
Love it.
Give him a Cape right now.

668
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,540
It's over.
I don't think he meant to do and I think

669
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:59,541
he couldn't help himself.
You know that guy went through a lot of 

670
00:28:59,541 --> 00:28:59,541
abuse when he was a kid.
He's a,

671
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:03,800
he's very sensitive to bullies.
I think when he sees a situation like 

672
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,651
that,
it's like you have to step in and do 

673
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:06,651
something like that girl just got 
punched.

674
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:08,520
I mean even if it was for a reason,
what could it have been?

675
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,230
I mean,
what's,

676
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,940
what's the reason to walk up to a 
chicken sucker?

677
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,150
Punch.
Drown your puppy.

678
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,510
What the fuck?
The is it.

679
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,370
There's no reason why.
What I sucker punch a check.

680
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,380
Let me think.
She would have had to have the keys to 

681
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,630
the nuclear bombs.
She was writing.

682
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,350
She stole my fucking phone.
I would fuck if she's still on my phone.

683
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,010
I would sacrifice.
Really.

684
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,260
That's all tanks.
A girl has to steal your phone and 

685
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,260
you'll sucker punch your fucking.
Wow.

686
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,520
You're very close with your phone.
He loves his phone.

687
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,960
Now.
Make my laptop,

688
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,980
my laptop.
Maybe my phone.

689
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:44,560
I would.
I would like push your head.

690
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,710
What's the.
You've been without a phone and without 

691
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:49,710
Internet connection.
What's the longest time?

692
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,120
Woo.
A man.

693
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,260
A T and t is will lied.
Saying they suck locally.

694
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,390
A T and t sucks balls at my house.
We can't talk on the phone at my house.

695
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,450
It's kind of weird and,
but God damn it that it'll come on in 

696
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,710
Thailand on a fucking island off the 
coast of Thailand.

697
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:12,690
My God.
Damn.

698
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,650
It's working.
I guess the roaming or something,

699
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,480
right?
Yeah.

700
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,310
I don't know what it is,
but I went to a,

701
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:20,140
um,
a resort once in Mexico in Cancun.

702
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,630
I wanted to go see the Mayan ruins.
We went to a teacher needs,

703
00:30:23,631 --> 00:30:24,960
uh,
and uh,

704
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,670
the resort that we went to,
we stayed up near Cancun.

705
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,340
No telephones,
no Internet access,

706
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,350
no television,
nothing.

707
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,970
There was nothing.
It was terrible.

708
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,570
I got movies to watch on my laptop.
I'm watching movies on my laptop,

709
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,540
my laptop,
Kennedy connect to the Internet.

710
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,560
You're running out of time,
man.

711
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,130
I like watching a little TV.
It doesn't matter where I'm staying,

712
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:53,710
how beautiful it is when I lie down in 
bed.

713
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:55,450
I like to see what the fuck's going on 
in the world.

714
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,830
Turned on CNN for a few minutes.
Last week I made a mistake.

715
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,190
I had one of the house phone,
so I called a t and t terry called the 

716
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,720
and t.
We got everything put together.

717
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:06,990
The DSL,
the hospital.

718
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,210
Well,
they hooked everything up except they 

719
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,071
shut the dsl off for five days.
Just show them the VSL,

720
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,800
the dialogue.
No Internet.

721
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,540
Dial up all my God.
After one day I was like,

722
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,010
fuck it.
If I just read it out,

723
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:26,011
I didn't bust down and go to the library
and I'll tell you what by the third day 

724
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:26,011
it was kind of fucking nice.

725
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:30,840
Really kind of rely on emails that I get
stressed so much.

726
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,020
Five days try for five days,
no cell phone.

727
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,140
See what your life.
You don't want Brock Lesnar does that 

728
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,140
shit sometimes.
You really got to think about it.

729
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,010
You really got,
and I know,

730
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,790
I know you're in a position where you 
need your cell phone.

731
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,530
Okay,
well listen man,

732
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:45,850
there's a.
obviously I agree with you.

733
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,370
That's why I moved to the mountains.
It's something about it.

734
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:51,010
I really enjoyed it.
I think being a seperate,

735
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,170
just having a little time to yourself is
very important.

736
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:58,171
Very important book.
I mean I'm a huge proponent of the 

737
00:31:58,171 --> 00:31:58,780
isolation tank and that's the whole 
theory behind lives.

738
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:02,970
Slips and tank being alone completely 
did in 98 memory.

739
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,980
I was going out psycho.
His girlfriends always have the best 

740
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,310
name again.
Board again was one,

741
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,110
psychos and other psycho.
Um,

742
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:17,470
we're,
we're at the tail end of the 

743
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:17,470
relationship.

744
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,370
It was falling apart and we decided 
let's try to rekindle our love and drive

745
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,630
up the coast of Monterey.
It's try it once,

746
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,410
see what happens.
One final fucking go at it.

747
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:25,690
Right?
So we drove up and it was pretty fucking

748
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:26,470
cool.
Getting high,

749
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:29,500
driving up the fucking pch.
The view was amazing.

750
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:31,330
I didn't realize the first time ever I 
drove up,

751
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:33,460
I didn't realize how beautiful the cause
of credible.

752
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,160
The view is incredible all the way up 
the coast.

753
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:38,700
It's like I kept pulling over a minute 
though.

754
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,210
I kept looking at him like she's all.
I'm like,

755
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,600
I got a video tape this.
This is like fucking heaven.

756
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:49,100
It's so close to the edge though.
That road that road's scary as fuck.

757
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,550
It's like you could easily just turn,
just decide.

758
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,640
This is it.
I'm going to end it.

759
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,370
Turned to the right and you're.
You're off the side of the cliff.

760
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,060
Oh,
oh,

761
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,040
oh,
scary.

762
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,470
Fuck you.
That's scary.

763
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,160
And you're trusting the other person 
coming the other direction.

764
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,350
You try trusting you to not be crazy and
suicide.

765
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:05,870
So we're driving up the coast.
We go up to Monterrey.

766
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:11,110
It's fucking cool.
We go to the aquarium video tape and 

767
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,110
shit.
I'm like,

768
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,110
fuck man,
why am I having a good time with her?

769
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,900
This is nice,
right?

770
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:15,330
Smoking weed the whole time and then we 
spend a couple of days and Manoa.

771
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:17,030
It was cool.
It was getting a little boring.

772
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,740
It was getting a little boring,
but I'm like,

773
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:23,741
okay,
we were going to drive back down and 

774
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:26,501
there's a place,
it's like the wilderness next to the 

775
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:29,051
beach on clips.
It's called big surfer and you rent 

776
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:29,051
little bungalows and we're going to rent
bungalows for two nights,

777
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,330
like fuck and go hiking and then hiked 
to the beach.

778
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,860
Fuck.
It's amazing.

779
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,580
It's fucking paradise.
We get there.

780
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,180
We check in for two nights.
Pam,

781
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:40,250
we immediately,
we go hiking and shed.

782
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,810
We had been in Monterrey for a couple of
days.

783
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,370
We go to the beach.
Fuck,

784
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,080
I got that all.
It's like some magical shit.

785
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:50,290
And then van that Sun was coming down 
and we go back to the bungalow and we 

786
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:50,540
didn't know.
They didn't have anything.

787
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,550
They didn't have radio,
TV,

788
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,810
nothing.
They had nothing straight up.

789
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,720
So we were like,
oh shit.

790
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,960
So it's like 7:30
and we're kicking back.

791
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:05,110
There's nothing to do.
So we watched the last two days at 

792
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,560
Monterey on the little lcd screen on our
quarter.

793
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,480
We're watching that and I'm thinking 
there's only 90 minutes of this.

794
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,080
It was,
it was.

795
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:13,850
I was beginning to see.
We fucked,

796
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,970
you know,
she first time ever we videotaped it.

797
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:17,600
It was like,
there was like,

798
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:17,840
whoa.

799
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,000
The first time we've ever videotaped sex
while we just,

800
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:25,380
we didn't,
we ran out of shit to do and now it's 

801
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:25,380
like 9:30
and shit.

802
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,530
Holy Fuck.
It was.

803
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,910
I realized something that how important 
TV and internet is,

804
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,490
especially when you're,
you know,

805
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,010
I could just go to sleep or whatever,
but when you're trying to entertain your

806
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:37,910
girlfriend,
I said,

807
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:38,850
fuck it.
I went back to,

808
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,020
I went to the front desk and I said,
I didn't know that we didn't.

809
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,230
There was no reception up here at all.
Can we get,

810
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,130
can I get a refund for tomorrow?
I just want to leave that next morning,

811
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,590
get the fuck back.
So I came back and I go,

812
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,080
guess what?
I said,

813
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,230
why did I go?
I go,

814
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:56,360
I got the refund for tomorrow night.
She goes,

815
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:59,490
yes,
she wanted the fuck out until.

816
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,820
I was like,
fuck out of here.

817
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,710
We're just lying though.
There's nothing to do.

818
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,030
We were already,
we've heard each other's stories for the

819
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:10,070
last six months.
Like what are you going to tell me a new

820
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:11,710
story about?
Here's the problem.

821
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Knew about you man,
when you first meet someone hanging out 

822
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:16,880
with them for 10 hours in a row and just
talking is easy.

823
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,030
We broke up.
I know on the way back she was in a bad 

824
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,030
mood.
Like we started fighting.

825
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,070
I'm like,
it's fucking over.

826
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,800
By the time I hit fucking Santa Barbara,
I was like,

827
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:27,830
okay,
thanks again as the exit plan.

828
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:29,720
You know what I mean?
It was done.

829
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,540
Kept your relationship together and I 
realized,

830
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,640
Oh shit,
we didn't have shit.

831
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,500
By the time I hit Santa Barbara and 
Ventura fucking.

832
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,590
I was like,
planning for the future.

833
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,780
No.
Without her you had fucking.

834
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,390
And sometimes that's enough to keep a 
relationship together for a.

835
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,800
We watched a lot of TV together.
If we didn't have tv,

836
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:51,590
what the fuck would we do to get them 
back?

837
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,260
Nowadays a couples couples like I went 
to my friend's house,

838
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,060
Steve from a,
you know.

839
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,270
Sure.
Steve Miley from La fight here.

840
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,140
Him and his girlfriend,
they got the big screen going and 

841
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,201
they've both got their laptops on their 
post every time I go over there watching

842
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:14,661
some movie on our laptop too and it's 
like that's the fucking wave of the 

843
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:17,150
future right there.
Right?

844
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,030
Well,
yeah,

845
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:19,800
if you're in that kind of relationship.
Yeah.

846
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:24,810
You know what?
You just were hanging out with you but 

847
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:24,810
we got shit to do,
but we're still hanging out.

848
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,350
We're still right here.
I could kiss you and all that,

849
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,860
but I got works.
Chicks,

850
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,790
they want to be watching the same thing 
though.

851
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:33,120
I don't want you in the room while they 
watch a movie and cuddle.

852
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:38,150
How you got to watch cuddling.
Why while you're watching the movie 

853
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,640
club.
Fuck the people on top of me yet I don't

854
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:52,270
a bucket,
but by love cuddling night,

855
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:56,860
late night when I'm watching like 
fucking use somebody to get my nokia.

856
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,470
Nobody.
Yeah,

857
00:36:58,471 --> 00:36:59,270
you're right.
You can't.

858
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:03,960
I can't.
You know I have.

859
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,140
I don't like that.
I like to ween myself off of shit.

860
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,360
Especially the last five or six years.
Right?

861
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:14,370
There's nights I don't sleep with the 
sleep apnea machine as even though I 

862
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:14,820
know I'm going to get a headache.
What if there's an earthquake?

863
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,140
What if?
What if?

864
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,170
I always want to prepare myself and 
that's why I don't like this shit.

865
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,180
These fucking luxuries guy.
That's why I was the last guy to get a 

866
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,960
fucking cell phone.
You know it.

867
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:26,930
You broke my balls for three years about
it.

868
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,550
Something about something about it.

869
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,540
You know what?
That pager,

870
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,570
what I call somebody and they have a 
cell phone than Atlanta pisses me off 

871
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:35,910
because it's not a house phone.
It's a cell phone.

872
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:37,170
It's in your pocket.
You miserable.

873
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,350
Mother answered the fucking thing.
You know what I'm saying?

874
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,870
And that's why I don't like cell phone 
because I like to get people.

875
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:45,150
I call them or they'll say,
let me look at your cell phone and smash

876
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:48,320
it because that's what.
It's a luxury and to the fucking thing.

877
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:50,610
It's the same thing with these fucking 
computers.

878
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,090
You've got to get on.
Especially you.

879
00:37:52,091 --> 00:37:57,091
You're an intelligent.
Get off this shit for five days and see 

880
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:00,021
how different your fucking life is.
I enjoyed it after the second day I was 

881
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:00,021
like,
God damn.

882
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:04,710
It's like I was on coke.
I had to go somewhere every 20 minutes 

883
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:04,710
to do a bump.

884
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,100
That's what I feel like when I'm on the 
computer.

885
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,430
Every time I'm home I got to stop what 
I'm doing every 30 minutes and see who 

886
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,750
emailed me or whatever.
It's really nice that they give a fuck.

887
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:14,880
Like,
you know what would be nice.

888
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:19,881
I agree with you,
but I actually actually enjoy the 

889
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,990
business when I get into mode and I 
gotta know I to answer all my emails.

890
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:25,290
Joint letter and I'm like,
pop,

891
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:25,680
pop,
pop,

892
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,420
pop.
What?

893
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:31,550
I read a letter from time to time.
I hand write a letter just to fucking 

894
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,690
keep me alive.
Door both depends on the shit.

895
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,800
You know what?
Let me ask you something if right now,

896
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:37,860
if I took your fucking phone and I asked
you what's your mother's number was?

897
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,860
You wouldn't fucking know it.
Neither would I.

898
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,010
we're getting too fucking comfortable 
guys.

899
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,180
Take your phone.
I smash it.

900
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,310
You're going to sit there scratching 
your lunch for two days.

901
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,930
You know,
three numbers in your head,

902
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,550
the house,
your manager,

903
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:53,260
and that's it.
You don't know nobody else's number.

904
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,320
The only number I know,
but I didn't even know that number and I

905
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,780
haven't lost your last one away for 
three days.

906
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,560
That's why they call you in Boston.
Last numbers.

907
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,080
You can store in your brain.
Me,

908
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,840
anybody in the old days because of my 
cocaine in my criminal shit.

909
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:18,841
I don't want numbers written on paper.
Never wrote papers when my mother died,

910
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,890
my sister anymore because my mom had all
those numbers in their head.

911
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,160
You know Jay z does those wraps in his 
head and on paper.

912
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:28,420
It's in your fucking head,
man.

913
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,190
That's kind of crazy.
That's insanity.

914
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,390
But you do need a paper from time to 
time.

915
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,300
Don't time where I didn't write any of 
my comedy.

916
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,130
Don't believe he don't.
He don't use a paper.

917
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,380
You got to write shit like a 
motherfucker.

918
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,420
I'll forget.
You know there's.

919
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:44,360
I forgot,
man.

920
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,700
What I think has happened in Joey

921
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:50,770
is much more complicated than that.
I think it's not that this is making us 

922
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:54,730
soft.
I think this is becoming a part of us 

923
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,010
and you leave your phone at home and I 
leave my phone at home and I go out and 

924
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,710
I realized I don't have my phone on me.
I feel naked.

925
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,110
Something's wrong.
Yeah.

926
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,640
I feel connected.
Vulnerable.

927
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,480
I feel vulnerable.
You walk in your door,

928
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:08,180
you pick up your phone and I called you 
big fucking deal.

929
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,600
It feels.
Feels good about it.

930
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,750
Think about when you walk in,
you haven't had your phone and you open 

931
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,240
it up and you think all this is all this
knowledge is going to be in there,

932
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:23,241
and I think it's nostalgia for the past.
I think we're moving towards an era 

933
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:27,671
where you don't remember phone numbers 
there on this device that controls 

934
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:28,280
everything in your life and it might 
even be a part of your body.

935
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,570
I think what we're,
you know,

936
00:40:29,571 --> 00:40:32,150
you can't hold onto the past where 
things are changing.

937
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,220
They're obviously changing in our 
lifetime.

938
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:36,020
The Internet has made things radically 
different.

939
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:41,021
Just in our lifetime.
We have had more change in our lifetime 

940
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:41,180
then hundreds and hundreds of years in 
the past.

941
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Just in a few decades,
I think this all this computer and 

942
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:46,490
technology and shit,
so I'm making a soft.

943
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,410
It's becoming a part of us and it's 
gonna.

944
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:53,411
It's gonna.
I think in some way it's going to help 

945
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:53,411
human beings evolve.
Well,

946
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:54,740
two years from now when the average 
bombed the fucking power,

947
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,370
the satellites,

948
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,440
we got no fault and you're stuck on 
fucking trying to call me fucking.

949
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:04,960
I had a fucking know joey's number that 
everybody,

950
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,580
at least in my worries,
when the world ends because no,

951
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:10,110
I didn't tell her about the world and 
he's listened.

952
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,740
They they'd been trying to hit you.
Ain't gonna have no lines.

953
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:16,990
When the world ends,
there's no full need to know how to with

954
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,460
your shoelace.
I understand they'll kill a rabbit.

955
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:20,580
That's why I'm getting ready for next 
year.

956
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:25,581
That's why.
That's why I hang out with the brothers 

957
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:28,361
and Vermont and shoot.
We're going to go hunting with Ricky 

958
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:28,361
Schroder.
We're going to make it a reality.

959
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,580
So Eddie Bravo,
me and Ricky Schroder out hunting.

960
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,210
I'm the only animal I've ever killed was
if you count,

961
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,910
set up a mouse trap and he killed 
another man.

962
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,990
That's the only thing I'm going to be 
down for that though,

963
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,300
right?
Go hunting with Ricky Schroder.

964
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,410
Fuck.
We should film that.

965
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:44,410
Right.
Come on over and get a rifle.

966
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,440
That would be interesting.
You and I super baked in the woods with 

967
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,150
guns.
What a great idea.

968
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,240
If I was really high,
I think it would be better at him.

969
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,440
I'm just kidding.
Ladies and gentlemen,

970
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:59,870
I wouldn't be high with a gun.
The same woods as other people.

971
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,790
I would not do that.
He can't do the rubber gloves to go to.

972
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,680
One is fucking.
You have to be very careful.

973
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:13,310
I read this article online about.
I was researching hunting in the hunting

974
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:15,100
exits in Maine because,
uh,

975
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:20,110
I was,
I used to have this joke about hunting 

976
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,110
in Maine and I was like,
I wonder what the real numbers were like

977
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,510
how many people actually got shot.
Well,

978
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:24,320
the real problem is experienced hunters.
They literally see deer,

979
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,380
they'll see a deer and they'll pull the 
trigger and then after they pulled the 

980
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,711
trigger,
they realize it's a woman in a red 

981
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:34,481
jacket.
It's like it's their mind plays tricks 

982
00:42:34,481 --> 00:42:36,230
on them because a seasoned hunter has to
get so good at recognizing movement.

983
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,300
There he is.
I got the opening poem,

984
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:43,301
pulled the trigger so their brain 
literally puts an image of a deer in 

985
00:42:43,301 --> 00:42:43,301
front of them.

986
00:42:43,301 --> 00:42:47,930
When they see motion,
your brain tries to already give you the

987
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:51,770
image before it even gets it because 
you're looking for it for it so bad that

988
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:56,771
your brain makes you visualize a deer.
There's the deer and these guys 

989
00:42:56,771 --> 00:42:58,720
literally say they saw a deer and the 
most horrible night.

990
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,530
How often does that happen?
All the time.

991
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,390
Really?
Yeah.

992
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,100
That's a problem and the problem is 
experienced hunters,

993
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:09,340
experienced hunters who just.
They're just used to knowing that you 

994
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:09,340
have to capitalize on,
on on a quick opening.

995
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,560
There's the opening thing.
I'm not going to person like that Shit's

996
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:13,250
real,
man.

997
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:18,850
That's the scariest thing about hunting 
hunters that don't know what the fuck 

998
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,840
they're doing and people accidentally 
shooting people.

999
00:43:20,841 --> 00:43:22,460
It happens all the time.
You got to experience.

1000
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:27,470
Hope is out there.
Thirty percent and the other is an 

1001
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:30,200
experience.
So some motherfuckers going to get shot 

1002
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,200
with.

1003
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,920
The article that I was reading was about
this guy who was an investigator and he 

1004
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:33,920
was out there,
uh,

1005
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,910
you like investigating people who were 
shot and you know,

1006
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:40,930
they had this one guy that he was a 
suspect and the guy wasn't experienced 

1007
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:40,930
hunter and he just,
you know,

1008
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:41,210
was asking the guy like,
hey,

1009
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:42,890
you know,
you see anything or anything going on,

1010
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,360
you know,
we've got a situation.

1011
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,530
And the guy's like,
no,

1012
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:46,520
no good.
See anything.

1013
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,670
All he did was just drive by the dude's 
house everyday for a week.

1014
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,530
Just pause in front of the house,
stop looking at them.

1015
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:57,610
Drive four or five days later,
the dude who just couldn't take it 

1016
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:00,851
anymore.
Imagine the guilt of accidentally 

1017
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:00,851
shooting somebody while you're hunting.
You know,

1018
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:05,050
you think you've seen a deer.
So I talked to the guy and that's what 

1019
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:05,390
the guy said once he finally confessed,
he said,

1020
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:06,440
I really thought it was a person.

1021
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,670
I mean I really thought it was an 
animal.

1022
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,260
I saw an animal.
I saw the horns,

1023
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:14,261
I saw the whole thing.
I saw buck with a big rack and I pulled 

1024
00:44:14,261 --> 00:44:16,601
the trigger and it was a person.
Let's go do that tape.

1025
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:21,620
Bit cost suckers.
That's what I want to go home.

1026
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,980
I want a hug.
You can't eat them man.

1027
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:29,050
I don't want to eat a fucking.
I don't even want to tell my animals 

1028
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:29,050
like crazy.
Yeah.

1029
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:29,050
But I don't want to eat something.
Light shot.

1030
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:29,830
Oh,
I see.

1031
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,240
Why not?
Don't you want to see that fucking hold 

1032
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,521
his head.
Why would you want the animal to die in 

1033
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:40,071
some fucking factory farm?
Or they get their brain smashed by a 

1034
00:44:40,071 --> 00:44:40,071
piston and you know,
they're,

1035
00:44:40,071 --> 00:44:43,040
they're living in cow shit all day for 
most of their life until that happened.

1036
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:44,130
I just don't want to shoot him that.

1037
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,750
You know what?
I don't want to either,

1038
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:50,751
but I eat meat and I love it.
I had a juicy fat fucking steak last 

1039
00:44:50,751 --> 00:44:51,760
night.
It was wonderful to meet.

1040
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,860
Now what?
I love it.

1041
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,110
I think it's a part of being a human 
being.

1042
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,490
I love Pussy,
but you don't see me.

1043
00:44:56,491 --> 00:45:01,491
Shoot me.
Shoot a pitch of the head with it.

1044
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,340
Even though I would love it.
I just don't want to shoot an animal.

1045
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:07,150
I know you don't got bless you 
motherfuckers.

1046
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,500
I know you don't want to.
I know you don't want to and I respect 

1047
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:12,690
that and I think there's nothing wrong 
with that.

1048
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:17,691
I love those guys.
I don't want you shooting Debbie and I 

1049
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:18,480
don't think that because you eat meat.
I don't buy the argument that you should

1050
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:20,130
have to shoot an animal.
I don't buy that.

1051
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:25,131
I think we've allowed ourselves to have 
somehow or another be removed from the 

1052
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:29,151
process of murdering,
slaughtering and butchering the animal 

1053
00:45:29,151 --> 00:45:31,970
and we just enjoyed the meat,
which is kind of crazy if you really 

1054
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:31,970
think about it.

1055
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:31,970
Fucking crazy.
So I just want to,

1056
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,670
for my own personal edification,
I just want to go and experience it.

1057
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:40,671
I want you to go,
why can we get a college shooting in 

1058
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:40,671
your back yard?
Well,

1059
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:40,671
you know,
you could.

1060
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:40,710
You know,
my,

1061
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,500
my gardener got in trouble for killing a
goat as backyard.

1062
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,120
What they do,
they got mad at them.

1063
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:46,770
They were going to evict him from the 
house and he's like,

1064
00:45:46,771 --> 00:45:47,640
I don't get it.
He's like,

1065
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:48,550
he goes,
I,

1066
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:52,050
I could cook right in my backyard 
because why can't I kill a goat?

1067
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,390
He was like,
this way,

1068
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:55,490
you know,
it's not diseased.

1069
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,150
It's safe.
It's like the safest thing to him.

1070
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:58,140
I was like,
so normal.

1071
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,010
Yeah.
It was like,

1072
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,030
well,
it is normal.

1073
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,170
I mean,
why can't he kill it?

1074
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,030
How come he can cook it?
How come he can.

1075
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:08,120
He could it be outside with a side of 
beef sawn off chunks and nobody would 

1076
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,120
say a word.

1077
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,120
They would say,
wow,

1078
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,831
that's a big piece of beef out there,
but if you actually killed the cow and 

1079
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:13,530
start sawing the beef,
he would get in big trouble.

1080
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:18,590
And I understand it because you've got 
to get rid of the crust and that's one 

1081
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:18,590
of those neighbor rather than,
oh yeah,

1082
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,560
someone rabid person to spend.
We don't give a fuck.

1083
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,530
He's the way he was talking about it.
It's like,

1084
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:26,730
why this is silly,
like,

1085
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:27,740
come on,
this is that.

1086
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,580
I want to make sure my meat is good.
You know,

1087
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,100
animals,
not disease.

1088
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,990
When I was a kid in Miami,
my uncle would get the pigs,

1089
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,970
bring them up,
freedom for a couple of weeks.

1090
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,920
Now I'm going to fucking kill him while 
we were there.

1091
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,200
Horrible.
I stopped eating pork for awhile because

1092
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:41,970
I saw that movie,
my brother's keeper.

1093
00:46:41,971 --> 00:46:46,971
Did you ever see that documentary about 
these guys that were kind of slow and 

1094
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,510
one of them I think got accused of 
murder or something like that.

1095
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,520
But anyway,
I'm in the documentary.

1096
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,830
They live on a farm,
I believe in upstate New York.

1097
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:54,180
I forget.
And uh,

1098
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,280
the guy went to kill one of the pigs and
he pulls out the shotgun and the pig 

1099
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,740
starts run and that pig knows what the 
fuck is going down.

1100
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,750
Pigs are smart.
They're smarter than dogs,

1101
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,990
so in this pig sees that shotgun,
he just starts fucking running and 

1102
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,541
squealing and scrambling.
The guys chasing after him finally gets 

1103
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:11,541
the gun to his head and blows his brains
out,

1104
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:16,400
but like while before it happens,
that pig is an utter sheer terror and I 

1105
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:16,590
thought about that.
I'm like,

1106
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,600
man,
I don't think I want to experience that.

1107
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,300
Like,
why am I eating pigs?

1108
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,380
Pig Bacon.
I eat it all the time.

1109
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,390
I gave up lot.
Listen while I was like,

1110
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:28,680
cows are dumb.
Fuck them.

1111
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:29,980
They're but really the

1112
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,230
shit that you're supposed to eat,
I think is the smart shit.

1113
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,180
I think you're supposed to eat fish.
Not Smart,

1114
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:36,910
but difficult to catch fish and game.
You know,

1115
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,960
there was a hard to catch like cows and 
pigs and you're sitting there laying 

1116
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:41,960
around.
That's probably not the best for you.

1117
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:47,550
I appreciate your argument and I know 
what I eat a piece of meat that some 

1118
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,820
cows hanging upside down with the 
fucking thing of his neck.

1119
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,770
I don't see it.
I don't want to think about it,

1120
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:54,040
but by me going hunting,
which I really couldn't do anyway,

1121
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,560
it would just make my life.
I know what I'm saying.

1122
00:47:56,561 --> 00:47:58,930
I don't even like venison.
I don't like none of that shit.

1123
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:02,530
I feel Scallopini of discern,
tally and makes it to me and he goes,

1124
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:07,531
I can't even feel like a motherfucker 
and I eat it and I make believe I don't 

1125
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:07,570
even know what the fuck.

1126
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:08,890
I mean.
You know what I'm saying?

1127
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,030
It's like eating pussy coked up and 
drunk the I can and that's it guys.

1128
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:15,310
I eat meat because of my necessities and
stuff.

1129
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,680
Fish.
No chicken.

1130
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:19,300
I eat and even though like I know that 
Nancy,

1131
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:22,270
they piss all over the fucking legs.
Chicken,

1132
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,460
I won't go to Popeye's chicken,
but eat chicken.

1133
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,760
Popeye's is delicious.
Spicy chicken with rice and beans.

1134
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,780
Fucking Popeye's.
Take the skin off and see the foot.

1135
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,630
You can see the end of the stations of 
the total.

1136
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:36,010
They cut the foot and half and see what 
the fuck's in there.

1137
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:37,930
You'll never eat popeye's again.
You understand me?

1138
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:42,810
I got his opinions are purely those of 
is true.

1139
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,450
I know all about your meat and all that 
shit experience podcast.

1140
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,880
This is all joey's opinions.
I for 1:00

1141
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,930
AM a huge fan of the Popeye's chicken.
I wish to avoid litigation.

1142
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,120
All right.
What about utilizing your like Popeye's 

1143
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,400
chicken player Loco's new chicken,
Jalapeno Sandwich to that?

1144
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,560
None of fluid that I'm telling you,
man.

1145
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,610
Oh,
player loco,

1146
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:08,670
Jalapeno chicken sandwich.
They just came out with the bread as 

1147
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:09,400
they did selling the bread that Mexicans
in the back,

1148
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:11,380
they.
They soak that shit in something.

1149
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,250
It's like a mcgriddle chicken sandwich.
It's so good talking to Mexicans.

1150
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:18,120
I got to get Mexicans promises sweet 
because I haven't counted something I've

1151
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,950
never encountered in my life.
I moved here to North Hollywood,

1152
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:23,080
the coolest neighborhood I've lived in 
in California,

1153
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,020
and we actually have a Mexican ice cream
man.

1154
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,530
You don't know what life is too.
You have a Mexican ice cream and there's

1155
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:32,800
no schedule.
Some days it shows up at 10,

1156
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:37,801
so some days he got ice cream.
Last week he showed up at 1115 while I 

1157
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:38,870
was watching the UFC on a Saturday 
night.

1158
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,160
Like you hear the fuck and I wish I was 
joking with you guys.

1159
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,400
This motherfucker comes at 11:00
being being.

1160
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:50,401
You go out there.
The best soft serve ice cream I've ever 

1161
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:50,401
had out here.
Better than dairy queen.

1162
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:51,420
All that shit.
Tremendous.

1163
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,980
He had shoes on their last week.
It was selling shoes.

1164
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,640
He's got popcorn.
That's hilarious.

1165
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,390
As long as you keep moving.
I guess he's got.

1166
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:04,180
He doesn't the ice cream.
Soft serve.

1167
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:05,350
He dips it.
Like the thing,

1168
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:08,530
like dairy queen is here at Bell School.
Is it?

1169
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,580
Is it a truck with a motor?
A fucking huge truck like Mr.

1170
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,170
softy and these coastal.
Okay.

1171
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,530
Oh,
so the ice cream man?

1172
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,360
No Music?
No.

1173
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:18,130
Nothing like I've seen the ice cream man
downtown.

1174
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:19,430
They're just because they allow.
They allow.

1175
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,620
But I got there and it just talks in 
Spanish and everybody flocks out.

1176
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:28,130
See those guys try.
This has a truck that has

1177
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,320
a belt thing here that people just come 
out.

1178
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,370
The ice cream is fucking delicious.
Great idea.

1179
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:36,830
The ice cream truck.
Is this one of the greatest ideas ever?

1180
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,580
No,
it's not.

1181
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,090
You only see them in poor neighborhoods.
Right?

1182
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,330
Well,
see him in a nice neighborhood.

1183
00:50:45,331 --> 00:50:50,331
It's hard to trust those motherfucker.
Some do just selling use of shit on the 

1184
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:50,960
street out of his truck.
That's not good.

1185
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,760
I grew up on Mr.
softy.

1186
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:57,770
That shit was still.
What are the laws that there are certain

1187
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:00,470
laws.
No.

1188
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:01,730
Yeah,
you have to have a license.

1189
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:04,210
You can't just do that.
You have to have some sort of a merchant

1190
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:09,220
slice.
You got to have a kitchen really hard 

1191
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,060
because trucks in rich neighborhoods.
But we really don't.

1192
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,960
Do people want to buy it?
Man.

1193
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:13,100
Rich neighborhoods,
you know,

1194
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:18,101
you can't be going through Beverly Hills
and an ice cream truck probably trying 

1195
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:18,920
to rob,
you know what it is.

1196
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,980
You know,
the main thing is they know in the rich 

1197
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:23,980
neighborhoods,
the kids just can't come out.

1198
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:29,050
They can't get to end the day,
but the kids are out in the fucking 

1199
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:29,050
streets.
Three and four.

1200
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,830
But like the kids are like fucking stray
dogs for neighborhoods.

1201
00:51:32,831 --> 00:51:34,580
Right.
And what I would go when I was little,

1202
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:37,230
my grandfather,
when I was living with my grandfather in

1203
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,270
Newark,
uh,

1204
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:41,450
they would be playing stick ball in the 
middle of the street.

1205
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:46,490
You would have to stop and whatever.
They'd be playing soccer in the middle 

1206
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:47,060
of the street.
They'd be playing like,

1207
00:51:47,061 --> 00:51:52,061
right.
There's a mostly Puerto Puerto Ricans 

1208
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:53,951
and Dominicans and stuff in New York.
And you would literally have to stop 

1209
00:51:53,951 --> 00:51:53,951
your car,
wait,

1210
00:51:53,951 --> 00:51:54,830
in order to get through to where you 
wanted to go.

1211
00:51:55,230 --> 00:52:00,230
Tell them in the street cars coming.
Everybody would stop the game for a 

1212
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,230
second.

1213
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,680
We did that car would drive by.
They'd restart the game.

1214
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,090
Epic Got Damn Day playing football in 
the street with cars.

1215
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,710
That was the story of my life.
A bunch of poor fucking Mexican.

1216
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,280
No one had a dad.
All 90 percent of all the kids were 

1217
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,180
like,
fucking the little rascals dude on my 

1218
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:16,180
fucking block.
It was,

1219
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:16,670
it was a couple guys that were like 10 
and 11.

1220
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,720
Once my Stepdad left that I was gone,
I was on the streets.

1221
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,720
I couldn't control me and my brother 
Stepdad could.

1222
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:24,860
But my,
once I was 10,

1223
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:26,840
we were on the fucking streets and it 
was like two,

1224
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,730
three dudes that 10,
my brother,

1225
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,590
14 and 15,
and then we had some 18,

1226
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:34,110
19 year old and some 20 and we're all 
mixed in plant foot.

1227
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,750
Paul organizing,
she,

1228
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,630
we're always on the street playing 
basketball game with a bunch of Mexicans

1229
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,920
and we're all in the rock.

1230
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,560
And Eric was in the rush.
No one had a dad.

1231
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,720
Everyone's dad was gone except for 
loreal.

1232
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,770
But fuck man,
there was a plan.

1233
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,800
I did it with ice cream truck.
Oh,

1234
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:54,830
ask them.
That was part of my life playing 

1235
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,930
football on the fucking street and asked
them truck coming by.

1236
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,250
That was,
that was.

1237
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:03,450
That was Irish Italian neighborhood.
And we played fucking everything on the 

1238
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,430
street,
stick ball football.

1239
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,530
And then when their leaves came down,
that's where you play two hand touch and

1240
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:12,590
the bricks.
We put the bricks in the middle of the 

1241
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,160
street and leaves on top of it.
And some dickheads driving with his car.

1242
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,070
Oh my God.
The fucking animals.

1243
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:19,250
When I lived in Jamaica plain,
when we first moved to Boston,

1244
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:21,980
we moved to a better neighborhood,
moved to this place to make a plane,

1245
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:25,440
and it was one of those streets where 
you would live on the street.

1246
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,100
There was like,

1247
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,120
you know,
maybe 15,

1248
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:32,121
20 kids that would live on the street 
and they would be hanging out in the 

1249
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:33,180
middle of the street all night.
It was like 3:00

1250
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:35,250
in the morning and you'd be like 
watching TV.

1251
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:37,210
They'd be like 10 feet in front of your 
window,

1252
00:53:37,211 --> 00:53:38,790
screaming at each other,
yelling,

1253
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:40,500
drinking beer,
throwing shit.

1254
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,640
Oh,
summer nights,

1255
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,450
nobody.
Nobody went to bed.

1256
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,020
It was a blizzard.
When there was a blizzard.

1257
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,410
Everybody was out in the street fucking 
riding a,

1258
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,920
taking sleds,
taking sled rides down,

1259
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:52,470
live down the hill.
It was crazy.

1260
00:53:52,471 --> 00:53:57,471
My mom couldn't control us.
Gone every week we had a thing called 

1261
00:53:57,471 --> 00:54:00,680
bombing.
Whenever we'd get together late at 

1262
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:00,680
night,
we'd get him Cammo a climb,

1263
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,810
lemon trees filled backpacks with lemons
and then we climb another trees and we'd

1264
00:54:03,811 --> 00:54:08,811
be all camouflaged and a tree and when 
the cars are coming by fucking told 

1265
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:08,811
lemons.

1266
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:10,070
Adam and then they would stop.
Dude would come out,

1267
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,580
he'd hiding in the fucking trees,
man,

1268
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,470
and they would never find us.
We were all camouflaged.

1269
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:18,870
We love camouflage,
but we would practice jumping fences and

1270
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:23,871
escape routes.
We knew everybody's backyard and 

1271
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:23,871
everyone's fence.
We would practice,

1272
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:26,520
so if any we got chased to the cops 
would even come by a cop chases,

1273
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:28,940
but they couldn't catch us.
What gone in the backyard.

1274
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,330
So the fences we were going through know
I had this conversation with Brian Cowen

1275
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,990
yesterday.
I'm going to have it again with you guys

1276
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:38,100
too because we're all the same and the 
three of us that we were kind of left to

1277
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:39,870
our own devices,
you know?

1278
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:44,930
Do you think that that's.
I think every interesting person that I 

1279
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:48,771
know,
almost all of them were not raised by 

1280
00:54:48,771 --> 00:54:49,080
the parents.
They're all like raised like wild dogs.

1281
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,060
They all like figured out their way 
through the world.

1282
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:52,860
Like they made a good relationship with 
their mother,

1283
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,660
but they don't really see her that 
often.

1284
00:54:54,661 --> 00:54:56,880
She didn't really teach them things.
They kind of figured things out on their

1285
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:58,590
own.
I for sure did.

1286
00:54:58,591 --> 00:55:00,690
Man,
I was leaving my brother on the streets.

1287
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,710
My mom just had to work all the time.
She works.

1288
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:08,430
If you have like,
if you had like a really cool dad who 

1289
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,941
was like a Christian who was like a real
Republican but Super Nice Guy,

1290
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:13,920
you could've.
You could have thought like that.

1291
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,090
If your dad raised you like that and 
brought you along like that.

1292
00:55:17,091 --> 00:55:18,300
Who knows?
You could have.

1293
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,470
Who knows?
I don't know.

1294
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,790
Do you think that would have been 
different?

1295
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:22,350
My mind programmed,
right?

1296
00:55:22,351 --> 00:55:25,110
Your brain gets programmed by the people
that are around you and especially,

1297
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:30,111
you know,
your influences and your teachers and 

1298
00:55:30,111 --> 00:55:30,111
your father.

1299
00:55:30,111 --> 00:55:32,420
Of course it's going to be the biggest 
teacher in your life if you find that 

1300
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,590
was a really nice guy and a sweet guy 
and a fun guy in a,

1301
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:36,750
a loving father and a Christian and and 
like,

1302
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:39,600
you know,
Really Gung Ho raw rob Republican.

1303
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:44,601
You know,
the United States would never do a bad 

1304
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:44,601
thing to us.
You,

1305
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:44,601
you could be sucked into that way of 
thinking,

1306
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:45,140
don't you think?
No.

1307
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,180
You don't think so?
You don't think so because you're,

1308
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:50,970
you and you grew up wild.
You grew up,

1309
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:52,530
your parents died young.
You were,

1310
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:57,531
you were really on your own and in a lot
of ways when you were taken in by 

1311
00:55:57,531 --> 00:55:57,531
people's,
uh,

1312
00:55:57,531 --> 00:55:58,010
people's generosity,
like your,

1313
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,080
your had a mom to a 14,
14.

1314
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,910
That's very young thing.
My mom was pro American dog right here.

1315
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,960
She was,
had a bookmaker and back.

1316
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,360
It was involved with heroin.
Right.

1317
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:14,100
But I'm saying to you,
it's very difficult to look at the world

1318
00:56:14,101 --> 00:56:19,101
like this is how you developed.
It's very difficult to step back and 

1319
00:56:19,101 --> 00:56:19,101
say,
okay,

1320
00:56:19,101 --> 00:56:22,680
how much of who I am is my environment.
I'll tell you what,

1321
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,070
when I a kid,
I didn't buy

1322
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,070
into the boy scouts.
I didn't buy into none of that shit.

1323
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,300
I never bought into clubs I never bought
into.

1324
00:56:29,301 --> 00:56:31,390
Now that she.
You grew up very streetwise.

1325
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:35,110
You've got some stories about your 
stepfather,

1326
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:40,490
but under the age of 10,
I wanted to be a white kid in American 

1327
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:40,490
kid.
I came here from another country.

1328
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:44,110
I grew up on Dick Van Dyke.
She just feel like insecure this day.

1329
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:46,300
I'm insecure about being Cuban.
No,

1330
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:49,240
I'm not about being Cuban,
but my big thing was to be an American.

1331
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,780
My mother came to get funding to be an 
American.

1332
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,520
He wants to be everybody else's.
Why you want to be black,

1333
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,190
black kids?
No,

1334
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:55,380
no,
no,

1335
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:56,890
no.
When I came to this country,

1336
00:56:56,891 --> 00:57:01,891
my mom stressed that.
We came here for you to be an American 

1337
00:57:01,891 --> 00:57:05,490
time on a bus.
Some kids are talking in Spanish and 

1338
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:08,161
they want to beat the teacher up because
the guy threw him off the fucking bus 

1339
00:57:08,161 --> 00:57:09,220
and made them walk on and I walked into 
the house and I told my mom,

1340
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:10,750
my mom's like,
I don't know what you're upset about.

1341
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,570
This is America.
You came here to do this.

1342
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:18,571
My mom raised me to be an American and I
seen some of the Shit I bought into.

1343
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,380
I'm hearing a song in the background 
right now.

1344
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:24,300
We're going to be some of the Shit I 
didn't buy into.

1345
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,610
Just the way that I never bought into a 
lot of that shit.

1346
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,910
I'm allowed to vote now.
I haven't had a felony in 15 years.

1347
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,260
You can vote now.
I can vote now,

1348
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,430
but I don't want it.
That's what happens.

1349
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:38,431
It's a 50 year tenure,
but I don't want to vote because what 

1350
00:57:38,431 --> 00:57:39,730
will my choices last year,
the old guy in Obama,

1351
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,880
all three of them were bad choices.
Tell it.

1352
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,840
I mean,
you know what I'm saying?

1353
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:49,170
So part of me is in the other part of me
isn't what was tell what happened with 

1354
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:51,820
the dense.
You have someone hostage.

1355
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:56,850
Can you talk 87?
I was a 27 years old,

1356
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:58,480
whatever.
I was working in boulder.

1357
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,720
I was going to school at night and I was
snorting coke with three hands and I 

1358
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,611
fucking got involved with some kid and 
he was going to rob his roommate and 

1359
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:09,370
ended up robbing them.
Both of them.

1360
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,660
The guy that I had an apartment was 
gonna rob me what a tangled web we weave

1361
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:18,250
when we tangled to deceive.
Just so happens that the guy got caught.

1362
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:23,251
Like I told,
I told him I didn't want nothing to do 

1363
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:23,251
with it.
Even though I had the coke with me.

1364
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:24,640
I sent the note to ask them,
but the other guy that got to try to rob

1365
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,590
me,
he ended up getting pulled over with the

1366
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:29,860
guy we kidnapped in the trunk of his car
all fucking bundled up and shit.

1367
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,040
So I got arrested for the kidnapping,
kidnapping to and everything.

1368
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,470
But you know what?
I fucked up.

1369
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,410
It wasn't because I fucked up.
It wasn't because America,

1370
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,020
listen bro.
I tend to seven.

1371
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:45,030
I got a ticket this morning for $200,
ten cents to seven this morning while I 

1372
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,310
was sleeping I was going to tie cheer at
seven,

1373
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:51,160
so I had to drive there.
So my wife said if you have to go to Tai

1374
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,160
Cheer at seven,
you might as well drop me off at the 

1375
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,021
train station.
I usually walk every morning to a train 

1376
00:58:58,021 --> 00:58:58,021
station,
but I drove her.

1377
00:58:58,021 --> 00:58:58,540
There was a lunch truck there I couldn't
pull over,

1378
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:00,970
so I pulled by where she crosses the 
street.

1379
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,920
When I made the right one,
I made the left.

1380
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:03,940
There was a cop.
He goes,

1381
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:05,860
Bro,
the bus drivers complain.

1382
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,390
He goes,
it's a thousand dollar ticket.

1383
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:10,360
I have to give you a $200 ticket for 
parking instead.

1384
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:11,020
Is that okay?

1385
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,090
And I took the ticket and I was not 
angry with him.

1386
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,650
I went to Tai Chee.
I did my thing.

1387
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,260
I didn't mention that he did his job.
This is America.

1388
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,720
He took his fucking job.
You fall uncertainty.

1389
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,640
A lot of people got off at this guy for 
pulling me over.

1390
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,860
He did his fucking job.
You know what?

1391
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,720
I kidnapped that guy.
I kidnap them.

1392
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:31,721
I did that.
I got four years and I got all fucking 

1393
00:59:31,721 --> 00:59:34,061
easy.
They should have thrown me in there for 

1394
00:59:34,061 --> 00:59:36,131
10 fucking years,
but people don't really have time to 

1395
00:59:36,131 --> 00:59:37,010
actually do 18 months.
Sixteen months.

1396
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,170
That's a long for the cost.
Me Two years of my life.

1397
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,090
You don't know what your life.
I'll press it.

1398
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:42,330
Horrible.
No,

1399
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:47,410
it was standing on my head,
but people that I could do that timely 

1400
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,550
time,
bro.

1401
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:52,910
And you do time guys like you'd only.
It's just another day in paradise.

1402
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:58,060
They're going to take us to a place 
where we get the bullshit about Jujitsu 

1403
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:58,060
instead of two hours a day,
eight hours a day.

1404
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,620
You follow me and you eat and whatever 
your freedom gets lost,

1405
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:02,450
which sucks,
but it's the people at home.

1406
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,430
It's not you or whatever.
We.

1407
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,280
I can do whatever the fuck I get.
My jeans are from Cuba.

1408
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:08,380
Motherfuckers.
Tell me about.

1409
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,400
I smoked the weed,
Castro smoke before we went to the 

1410
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:13,400
mountains to take over.
You understand me now?

1411
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,560
What was a typical day in prison like 
for you?

1412
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,200
Like at that six month year in there?
Six months.

1413
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,230
What's a typical day?
Living like a doctor who liked him,

1414
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,820
Bro.
You gotta remember I went to prison for 

1415
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:26,820
four years.
I got sentenced,

1416
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:26,820
but guess what?
I became.

1417
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:30,280
I became a standup comic.
I learned how to do stand up on Thursday

1418
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:30,560
nights.

1419
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,660
They used to have movie night.
I didn't even know that dog.

1420
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:34,460
They used to have movie night on 
Thursday night,

1421
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,190
so the projector would always fucked up 
like stream.

1422
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,470
It would always fucked up.
Joe.

1423
01:00:38,471 --> 01:00:40,340
We talk into the microphone.
It would always fucked up,

1424
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:43,100
so on Thursdays the people just 
jokingly,

1425
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,440
I would always go,
what the fuck is wrong with the project?

1426
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,780
And everybody will say Cuba,
get up there and talk.

1427
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:52,380
So I would go up down negative result 
you your people and like 100 more black.

1428
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:54,770
So they go Cuba,
go up there and talk and that would make

1429
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:56,400
fun of the black guys.
Like what would it be?

1430
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:57,650
What would you say?
You know,

1431
01:00:57,651 --> 01:01:02,030
we make fun of the kitchen.
The kitchen is just the beginning of the

1432
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:07,410
beginning.
We used to make for the ice to other 

1433
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:07,410
movies,
roles.

1434
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:11,320
I fucking,
the first day in prison they made me a 

1435
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:11,320
baker.
You know,

1436
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:11,320
you don't,
you don't tell people what you want.

1437
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,000
It's like Cuba,
like yeah,

1438
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,610
on the outside that was a mechanic 
really.

1439
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,220
Well in here you're a baker.
Here's a book,

1440
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,810
learn how to make bagels maybe.
And almost blew up the kitchen,

1441
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:23,320
right?
These motherfuckers so that the.

1442
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,440
They fired me as a baker and they made 
me a fucking dishwasher and wash and 

1443
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,820
they're stuck for real clothes and 
whatever.

1444
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:36,821
They had shitty meals.
The guys that I knew when they were 

1445
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:36,821
going through the line,
I would yell,

1446
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:36,821
don't do.

1447
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,800
So I would go,
don't do it.

1448
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,000
How often were the meals?
Three times a week,

1449
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:49,390
but it didn't matter because at lunch 
time I was allowed to go to the store 

1450
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:52,661
for 15 minutes.
I worked it out where I had to drive to 

1451
01:01:52,661 --> 01:01:55,361
take garbage out,
so I would go to the store for 15 

1452
01:01:55,361 --> 01:01:55,361
minutes.
Not only that,

1453
01:01:55,361 --> 01:01:55,460
I would call it my own at the Chinese 
restaurant,

1454
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,380
so it would be ready by the time I got 
there,

1455
01:01:57,381 --> 01:02:00,320
so I would go back to the prison with 
Chinese food and groceries.

1456
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:05,620
That's how strong I was in there.
Plus they were doing steroids and 

1457
01:02:05,901 --> 01:02:08,750
selling drugs in prison waves like a 
motherfucker,

1458
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:13,990
so I always in the stock room clerks,
so they had to pay me rent so high 

1459
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,990
because they never stopped.
You start,

1460
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:19,130
but you got to give me $3.

1461
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:26,220
You got to give you some cigarettes.
Cigarettes.

1462
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:29,700
I had pills and they have.
They just belong to other people,

1463
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:32,340
but you put them on the pallets.
So I would give them a key,

1464
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:33,750
whatever they needed to go take shit 
out.

1465
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,300
So they knew where the connection.
I was the.

1466
01:02:35,301 --> 01:02:39,090
I was to know I was the holdup.
Plus they get the steroids and so he had

1467
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:41,790
to put it up their ass or whatever.
I don't know.

1468
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:46,791
I never asked him.
Imagine shooting a steroid in the 

1469
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:49,050
smuggling in again going to get.
Then they put it.

1470
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:54,051
Where that contact visits should do is 
you take your fucking kid and you fill 

1471
01:02:54,051 --> 01:02:56,850
his pockets with the [inaudible] and why
you're making out with your husband.

1472
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,030
You said you want to see the kid and you
pass the kit to the husband and he takes

1473
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:01,600
the drugs out that it gives your back.

1474
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:07,050
That's how Henry Hill did it.
That's how they do it.

1475
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:08,360
Same Shit.
It's no.

1476
01:03:08,361 --> 01:03:10,530
You can grow.
There's more drugs on the inside.

1477
01:03:10,531 --> 01:03:12,540
That was.
It wasn't the outside and to boot.

1478
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:16,020
This was a minimum security camp.
We had contact visits.

1479
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:18,810
When you have a contact visit,
there's parties every night.

1480
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,880
These motherfuckers.
That's the first time I didn't know.

1481
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:27,120
I was like,
the second time I did it was it couldn't

1482
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:29,760
do a needle,
so the Mexicans took a Mexican thing.

1483
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:32,340
A heroin melted it.
I'd put like a funnel in mind.

1484
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:37,341
Those made out of paper and they dripped
to them my nose and I got mad like 

1485
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:38,790
candle wick burn out of my house.
What the fuck is this?

1486
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:39,630
They're like,
that's heroin,

1487
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:40,740
man.
Be Cool.

1488
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:44,250
I was like this for like a day and the 
white dudes,

1489
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:48,360
Mike was a gimmie speed and they will 
play basketball all fucking night.

1490
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:53,540
I'll be out there,
be out there with them half an hour.

1491
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:59,850
Every week was a new adventure.
Every drug was out there.

1492
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:09,870
Fucking minimum security prison where 
everyone's partying and greatest time 

1493
01:04:14,761 --> 01:04:16,650
ever to take a public.
When you get,

1494
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,420
when you,
when you,

1495
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:22,430
when you get released.
It's like funeral,

1496
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,120
which was even talking to Mike.
People keep complaining about.

1497
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:25,970
I was,
I was.

1498
01:04:25,971 --> 01:04:26,820
I was.
When?

1499
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,880
When I go to the halfway house I was 
even better because I started loaning 

1500
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:31,880
money after the index.
As a loan.

1501
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,360
Shark fix?
Yeah,

1502
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,400
because they want to go out.
But if your rent's not paid on Thursday 

1503
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:37,400
and I allow for the weekend so the rent 
will be $65,

1504
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,020
so I give him 65 and 92.
You know what I'm saying?

1505
01:04:40,021 --> 01:04:45,021
Like I'm going to give you $65,
we got to give me 92 tomorrow and I had 

1506
01:04:45,021 --> 01:04:48,550
10 guys on that role,
but I was a fucking machine in that scam

1507
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,920
I had at the camp.

1508
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,650
The biggest scam I had was with,
there was an old Italian dude,

1509
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,280
Brooklyn.
He was like a half a mobster and he had 

1510
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:58,280
pool parties and he would only do one 
card a week.

1511
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,210
You would make like 30 bucks and I went 
up to him.

1512
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:00,660
I go,
Bro,

1513
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:02,160
you have a problem with these cards?
I go,

1514
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,230
you've given them two white guys,
you're not getting.

1515
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:06,180
The black population is not getting the 
fucking spics.

1516
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:06,840
And he goes,
I don't know.

1517
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:08,100
They won't talk to me.
I said,

1518
01:05:08,101 --> 01:05:09,900
give me the fucking card.
We're going to go partners.

1519
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:15,170
He went from selling one card.
Every Monday they're doing 10 with me 

1520
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:15,450
because I had brothers,
I had the guns,

1521
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,560
I had the Puerto Rican side,
the white and everybody and it was 

1522
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:20,980
amazing.
That's why I really learned that I could

1523
01:05:20,981 --> 01:05:23,830
really fucking do this.
So on Thursday nights they would say,

1524
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:24,910
Cuba,
fuck the movie.

1525
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:29,910
Just go up there and talk about the 
kitchen and they all the with y'all 

1526
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:33,691
don't do it was fucking hysterical and I
was just talking about it.

1527
01:05:34,311 --> 01:05:37,200
And then I had this one crazy black guy 
was [inaudible].

1528
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:43,050
His name was spencer.
I'm from New Orleans and he was crazy 

1529
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:47,130
and he called me.
He told me that he was in there for 

1530
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:47,130
eight years for involuntary manslaughter
and he was my mentor.

1531
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:50,260
That was my dog Jack.
He was fucking nuts and he would tell me

1532
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,080
like one day some guy now them $2 and he
comes into the kitchen.

1533
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:54,430
He goes,
did you see that guy?

1534
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,910
And I go,
no,

1535
01:05:54,911 --> 01:05:58,300
I think he's packing and leaving this 
motherfucker went and got a knife.

1536
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,220
He got them at the gate as the guy was 
getting out of Jay's like,

1537
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,920
motherfucker,
you better get my $2.

1538
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,780
I was blown away by this guy was old and
his parents and family had money there.

1539
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:12,780
That's like the best attorney from Bro.
This guy killed somebody with his hands 

1540
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:14,500
and he got eight years with a black guy 
and,

1541
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:15,370
and,
and uh,

1542
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:18,310
and La Downtown la because I was in the 
federal place.

1543
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:23,460
He beat him with his fucking hands and 
got eight years for voluntary 

1544
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:25,960
manslaughter.
He had like $50,000

1545
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:27,820
attorney's this guy,
but he had a knife.

1546
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
He got a gold tooth in his mouth.
He was one of those brothers and shit 

1547
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,471
that his eyes would go crazy.
Why do you think the gold to thing 

1548
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:36,430
really caught on in the black community?
Because it's fucking,

1549
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,280
it's like a pubic hair in your mouth.
You know what I'm saying?

1550
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:41,850
It's all about bringing,
you know what I mean?

1551
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:46,130
Because that gets.
People look directly at your face.

1552
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:48,140
So you want to,
you want to catch our attention.

1553
01:06:48,141 --> 01:06:50,270
That's why you got the necklace.
That's why you got to watch,

1554
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,920
but nothing beats the next.
You know,

1555
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,160
that's why they blamed the glasses out 
tears and it's like,

1556
01:06:55,190 --> 01:07:00,190
yeah,
but that never caught on with the white 

1557
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:00,190
community.
That's where white people drew the line,

1558
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:00,720
stopped.
They went up the,

1559
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,340
the,
the,

1560
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,290
we can't join you on this one.
You know,

1561
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,410
white people can't join you on this one.
Well Ma'am Ma'am Ma'am.

1562
01:07:06,411 --> 01:07:08,900
Where's it as a goof?
He's a character in real life.

1563
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:09,590
Okay.
Listen,

1564
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:11,810
in real life may have been walking 
around with a grill on.

1565
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:14,480
He does it like part of it is like to be
silly,

1566
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:15,710
to be mayhem,
you know,

1567
01:07:15,711 --> 01:07:18,660
but it's not like he wants to be wearing
a nice style grill like,

1568
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,690
like fucking little wayne or something.

1569
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:23,470
Okay.
If,

1570
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,760
if that is the case,
if mayhem does,

1571
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:30,820
that's one out of like,
you know how many winners are there out 

1572
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:30,820
there?
Hey,

1573
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:33,470
a big number.
It's a giant number and then I'll,

1574
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,720
I'll tell you what Paul Wall,
right?

1575
01:07:35,721 --> 01:07:40,400
He's a white guy.
You know one thing about white guys that

1576
01:07:40,401 --> 01:07:42,260
wished there were black,
they are one,

1577
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:46,730
they have all one thing in common.
They will deny that they would rather be

1578
01:07:46,731 --> 01:07:50,060
black than light.
They'll deny that shit no matter what.

1579
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:50,980
Yeah,
you can that.

1580
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:52,220
No,
I'm happy being myself.

1581
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:53,840
You know what I'm saying?
It's just a hip hop culture,

1582
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,240
hip hop culture thing.
You know,

1583
01:07:56,241 --> 01:07:58,160
it's where I grew up.
I grew up like this.

1584
01:07:58,161 --> 01:07:59,780
You know what I'm saying?
What I'm saying?

1585
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:01,310
You know,
it's all above the game.

1586
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:02,810
You know,
saw about the hip hop game.

1587
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:08,570
They got an NBA Jersey pubic hairs.
You can't talk like that.

1588
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:12,860
He got red pubic hair son.
They try extra hard,

1589
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:14,660
you know,
white guys who want to be black,

1590
01:08:14,661 --> 01:08:15,830
they have to try extra hard.

1591
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:18,620
Was crazy though.
But I with Eddie,

1592
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:22,360
what I was telling you was data I want 
in there.

1593
01:08:22,361 --> 01:08:26,120
Every Thursday I get on stage and then 
one day this is fucked up Joe Rogan.

1594
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:29,240
This is why I really dig it because one 
day the guy in the library,

1595
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:34,241
it was like a nerdy dude.
The guy that ran the library and I was 

1596
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:34,241
friends with them.
We did acid,

1597
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:36,530
he was very into nostradamus and you 
know,

1598
01:08:36,531 --> 01:08:39,220
he was intelligent but he had just,
he had some problem or something.

1599
01:08:39,221 --> 01:08:42,530
You went to prison and the funny thing 
was that one day he came up to me in the

1600
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:47,531
jail and a notebook was a big thing and 
I was getting ready to get out and I 

1601
01:08:47,531 --> 01:08:48,530
never even thought about it.
He came up to me and he goes,

1602
01:08:48,531 --> 01:08:49,760
hey bro,
I got shit notebook.

1603
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,140
Like the notebook for you.

1604
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,990
It was so when you get out you can write
some jokes.

1605
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:55,010
He goes,
he goes,

1606
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,350
every week you write jokes.
I never see the notebook.

1607
01:08:57,351 --> 01:09:01,130
And I looked at and I go,
I don't even write and this motherfucker

1608
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,210
went nuts.
He goes,

1609
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:07,211
you don't right,
and you go up there every we can do 

1610
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:07,211
that.
He goes,

1611
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:07,610
when you get out of here,
it was like an angel.

1612
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,530
It was like an angel.
I never seen the guy again.

1613
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:11,690
I never heard from him again.
He just goes,

1614
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,960
what I want you do,
you really need to write and get it 

1615
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,290
together because you have a gift.
Just pursue this and that guy never even

1616
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:20,300
talked to me like he never used to talk 
to me.

1617
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,910
I just set it out of the blue,
came up to me one night.

1618
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,110
He goes,
no,

1619
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:26,440
the black guy,
white guy,

1620
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:27,560
white,
nerdy guy.

1621
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:32,740
That was like a really nerdy guy that 
will always roll his own cigarettes or 

1622
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,120
some random guy came up,
got talent.

1623
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,400
Do you think that if you didn't go to 
prison,

1624
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:42,401
if he didn't have that experience of 
talking in front of those people that 

1625
01:09:42,401 --> 01:09:42,401
you probably never would have done 
standup over,

1626
01:09:42,401 --> 01:09:43,130
stand up something that was in the back 
of your head anyway,

1627
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:48,160
it was in the back of my head.
The prison really woke the animal up 

1628
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,830
because it before I had thought I bro,
if any.

1629
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:55,520
Because you had to be funny before 
prison heard the niggas crazy by Richard

1630
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,170
Pryor.
You had to think of.

1631
01:09:56,190 --> 01:10:00,510
He pushed it so hard on that before 
prison for the pilot,

1632
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,500
I thought I was always good at.
I'm at the Deli.

1633
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:08,501
I was always telling stories.
It was always good with that shit and 

1634
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:11,441
then the thing that really got me was 
when you go to prison and do a 

1635
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:12,770
diagnostic on you and I like to get an 
attorney now that really,

1636
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,810
that's the only thing that irks me about
my life.

1637
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,370
Like a lot of times people say,
Oh,

1638
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:21,371
I slept with this guy with me is I 
always wanted to know what's on that 

1639
01:10:21,371 --> 01:10:23,300
paperwork because it was an intense 
psychological evaluation.

1640
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,550
It just wasn't a guy with a piece of 
paper saying,

1641
01:10:25,551 --> 01:10:28,520
what do you think when you see a star?
Like they put shit in my head,

1642
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,560
electrodes and all this shit.
It was three days of mental testing and 

1643
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,190
it was eating me alive and I wanted to 
know.

1644
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:36,860
I kept asking the counselor who was from
Mississippi,

1645
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:38,550
he hated black people.
He hated specs.

1646
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,670
He told me to my face.
My counselor told me.

1647
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:41,140
He goes,
I hate.

1648
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:46,450
He goes,
I hate or you fuckers specs and I mean 

1649
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,330
that's how the counselor.
And he said to me,

1650
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:48,770
he goes,
I go pro.

1651
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,120
His name was Mr Blue.
I go,

1652
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:51,050
what are you going to fucking tell me?

1653
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:54,050
What's on there and one day he's like,
you really want me to tell him what time

1654
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:56,480
he had bugged fucker.
That's what he would call me to my face.

1655
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:57,950
Bug fucker.
He goes,

1656
01:10:57,951 --> 01:10:58,940
I'll tell you what,
hit Mr.

1657
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:04,030
Buck fucker.
It said that if you really wanted 

1658
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:04,030
something and I had it that you would 
take it from me.

1659
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:05,030
He goes,
no,

1660
01:11:05,031 --> 01:11:10,031
you do what the fuck you want with that,
and they threw me out of his office and 

1661
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:10,670
I felt like a thief for three days.
That's what I read or that.

1662
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:14,040
But what he was trying to tell me was 
that anything I wanted in my life,

1663
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,800
that's what it said,
that I could do anything you want.

1664
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:19,830
You could do do it.
That's what he was saying.

1665
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,340
That's what he was trying to beat around
and calling your bug fucker.

1666
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:24,690
No,
by saying what he said,

1667
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,210
lady came up to me.

1668
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:26,580
He goes,
hey,

1669
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:28,170
did you understand where I was going 
with that?

1670
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,880
He goes,
you're a smart guy.

1671
01:11:29,881 --> 01:11:33,870
You're not one of these guys.
Use to experience.

1672
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,410
Tell us about your first standup Gig.
Do you remember it?

1673
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,460
Yeah.
I remember.

1674
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:42,160
What made you go up that night?
Do you consider the ones in prison there

1675
01:11:42,161 --> 01:11:44,480
first standup gangs?
I'm talking about birds and fish or at a

1676
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,580
club.
Like your first time you went up like a,

1677
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:47,490
but I'm.
It's.

1678
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:52,580
I'm thinking that if you did it,
how many times did you do in a prison 

1679
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,940
you really were doing tonight?
I was doing every Thursday for sure.

1680
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,140
If that's not a bunch of times you had 
material.

1681
01:11:58,141 --> 01:12:03,141
Did you have material planned out?
Did you have stuff that you repeated 

1682
01:12:03,141 --> 01:12:05,340
what you imagined?
Repeat new jokes in front of those young

1683
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:10,540
shit and all those crazy Mexicans.
That's the first time I really knew 

1684
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:10,760
about the whole heritage.

1685
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:16,040
They would sneak in.
Fucking Green Chili Burrito was 

1686
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:16,380
tremendous.
Really had the best tattoo artists.

1687
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:21,390
Was it the Mexican Mexicans?
Mexicans always have wild jail tattooed 

1688
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:25,330
generations of Mexicans.
At one time I was in jail with the 

1689
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:25,330
grandfather,
the ils,

1690
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,300
the father and the son.
Whoa,

1691
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,000
that's really neat.
You start seeing that thing,

1692
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:35,001
you know had been a movie right now.
This is fucking crazy and I always 

1693
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:36,780
wanted to shoot somebody and be a 
criminal.

1694
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:38,830
I didn't,
you know,

1695
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,180
I always thought about that my life 
deserve more than to spend it in here.

1696
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,160
That's what prison did for me,
Bro.

1697
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,760
If people come up to me and go,
how bad was prison?

1698
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:50,100
Prison is how bad you make it for me.
For me,

1699
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:52,720
it opened my eyes.
I became a standup comedy.

1700
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:55,530
It just gave me that opportunity to see 
by the way,

1701
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,560
you see the show,
but that dude that robbed millions.

1702
01:12:58,561 --> 01:13:00,150
What's that guy's name?
Two years ago,

1703
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,460
Guy.
They want to wave the Pudsey schemes.

1704
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:07,680
You get a chance.
Watch that on fucking MSNBC show on Ms.

1705
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,370
Bernie Madoff,
North Carolina.

1706
01:13:11,371 --> 01:13:16,371
Now.
He went right in and teamed up with the 

1707
01:13:16,371 --> 01:13:18,771
fucking mob.
He paid people and he don't give a fuck 

1708
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:18,771
that guy about people.
Well,

1709
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:21,360
you talked into people have to tell you 
that you were finding that you should go

1710
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:26,361
on stage.
Do people tell you that you should do 

1711
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:26,361
that?
Yeah.

1712
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:26,361
Tell us about the first time on stage.

1713
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:29,350
I would consider the first time he was 
on stage.

1714
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,520
The first time outside of prison.
The first time I was my first time on 

1715
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:37,860
stage was an open mic night,
but before I went to the open mic night,

1716
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,050
it was locker room.
Yeah,

1717
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:39,700
yeah,
yeah.

1718
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:44,710
I understand that and if your first your
first night efficiently as a comedian is

1719
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:46,670
an interesting one.
It's interiors,

1720
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:49,290
but I'm so curious about yours.
The truth is,

1721
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,860
the truth of the matter is now you get 
down with it and remember it,

1722
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,670
but come on dog.
About a month ago,

1723
01:13:53,671 --> 01:13:58,671
I got a call from a friend of mine and 
we were talking that I hadn't talked to 

1724
01:13:58,671 --> 01:13:58,671
her.
I hooked up with them on facebook and he

1725
01:13:58,671 --> 01:13:58,671
said something to me.
He goes,

1726
01:13:58,671 --> 01:14:03,561
Bro,
I knew on that bus ride home that you 

1727
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:03,561
always going to be an entertainer.
I asked him,

1728
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:04,380
I go,
what are you talking about?

1729
01:14:04,381 --> 01:14:09,381
He goes,
do you remember if the freshman 

1730
01:14:09,381 --> 01:14:09,900
basketball you would get on the bus and 
fucking go off every night?

1731
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:15,250
He goes,
it got to the point where the bus 

1732
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:15,250
drivers

1733
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,070
wouldn't pick you up anymore because we 
used to go on and do the theme from the 

1734
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:18,760
couple that had done it and then that 
would go into a fucking 20 minutes,

1735
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:23,761
get all the way we got to the say and I 
even wrote a blog about it that after he

1736
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:26,050
told me that,
like I called a bunch of people in those

1737
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:28,510
days and I to go pro.
What do we do on the bus?

1738
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:29,920
No,
like you don't remember.

1739
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:32,950
We used to take over [inaudible] buses,
the number one bus,

1740
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,000
90th street at 38th street.
We ran it and you were the fucking host 

1741
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,000
and MC.
And I'm like,

1742
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,340
wow.
And I started thinking.

1743
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:40,390
I'm like,
that's right.

1744
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,780
So if I really go to that,
that was freshman year basketball.

1745
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:48,840
Wow.
I used to like the buses up every time 

1746
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,320
and they would fucking pick.
I remember that like being out there for

1747
01:14:50,321 --> 01:14:55,321
two different bus drivers and they would
pick you up because you guys are too 

1748
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:55,321
fucking loud.

1749
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:55,480
Wow,
that's hilarious.

1750
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:58,000
But then in school,
you know,

1751
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,760
no one ever considers that maybe this 
guy should be a standup comedian.

1752
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,470
They just go,
we got to silence him.

1753
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:07,490
We've got to stop this.
We've got to teach some discipline to 

1754
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:10,321
you.
The lack of discipline is really what 

1755
01:15:10,321 --> 01:15:11,200
makes someone a comic though I wasn't a 
standup at all,

1756
01:15:11,201 --> 01:15:12,850
like in that sense,
like growing up.

1757
01:15:12,851 --> 01:15:17,851
But I was always every year,
depending on the teacher I had because 

1758
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,320
junior high and high school,
you have like seven teachers.

1759
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,020
I was always the dude,
don't start shit.

1760
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:28,140
Play pranks and always,
unless the teacher was Mr Endres you 

1761
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,440
never did shit.
He just fucking.

1762
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,810
He was a bad motherfucker.
You know what you want to act up.

1763
01:15:31,811 --> 01:15:32,860
You want to.
Do you want to talk?

1764
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,570
We talked about this before on the 
podcast.

1765
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,910
It was Mr Sanders,
Mr Sanders.

1766
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:37,960
10th grade.

1767
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:39,700
Uh,

1768
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:43,110
I think geology.
I don't remember.

1769
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:44,610
There's no way to tell.
You know,

1770
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:49,650
the funny thing about someone becoming a
comic is there's no one who could have 

1771
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:50,850
pulled you aside and said what you 
really need to do is become a comic.

1772
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:54,960
It's like you almost have to experience 
all this resistance to your personality,

1773
01:15:54,961 --> 01:15:58,590
to regular life.
Then that forces you into being a comic.

1774
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:00,690
It's like someone can't just come up to 
you and go,

1775
01:16:00,691 --> 01:16:02,760
this is what you really need to do.
You didn't really need to be a comic.

1776
01:16:02,761 --> 01:16:07,761
Like you need to go through all the 
bullshit in life to experience that 

1777
01:16:07,761 --> 01:16:07,761
before someone comes along and tells 
you.

1778
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:10,860
How old were you when you first got on 
stage?

1779
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,280
Thirty,
30,

1780
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,340
29.
I was 20.

1781
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:24,550
I was 21.
It would have been better for I 30 

1782
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:24,550
because when I was 21 I didn't have shit
to say.

1783
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,030
I have no opinions about anything.
Kenneth,

1784
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,230
my,
your comedians stand up comedians.

1785
01:16:28,231 --> 01:16:33,231
There's a lot of guys.
They can be fun and it'll be funny if 

1786
01:16:33,231 --> 01:16:34,530
that's what they.
My problem was when I was 21,

1787
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:40,010
my whole life from 15 to 21 was all just
taekwondo tournament and kickbox and 

1788
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:42,090
that's all I did.
That was 24 hours a day.

1789
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:45,000
That was all I thought about.
I didn't really consider the world.

1790
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,880
I didn't.
I didn't want to be a loser and I wanted

1791
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:51,890
to be really good at talking window and 
I wanted to win the nationals and I 

1792
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:52,300
wanted to compete in the Olympics.
I had all these ideas up.

1793
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:57,540
I didn't know about fucking politics.
I hadn't a clue as to what was going on 

1794
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:57,540
in the world.

1795
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:58,260
I didn't even think about it for a 
second.

1796
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:03,290
Oh,
I thought about was this and getting 

1797
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:03,290
laid.
That's what I thought about.

1798
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:03,900
So when I started going into comedy,
I literally had no opinions.

1799
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:06,960
I know how to kick somebody.
I don't know how to kick somebody in the

1800
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:11,000
head and I know I like pussy,
pussy jokes,

1801
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,580
sex jokes for like the first year and a 
half.

1802
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,700
So I wrote this when I'm 21 years old.
What the fuck?

1803
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:19,340
Kind of the opinion that I have.
That was interesting on anything.

1804
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:24,370
If I told you anything about anything 
other than sex or kicking somebody in 

1805
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:28,181
the head,
you would already know what I was going 

1806
01:17:28,181 --> 01:17:28,181
to say way in advance.
I,

1807
01:17:28,181 --> 01:17:29,570
I didn't have enough life experience.
My life experience is very limited.

1808
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:35,410
I hear that a lot,
that people to yell to say maybe 30 

1809
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:36,350
years.
The kind of comedy you do,

1810
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,780
will you look at you,
look at you,

1811
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:38,270
you stupid.

1812
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:38,930
Fuck,
you know,

1813
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:40,910
you do that kind of comedy.
We appoint some shit out.

1814
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,920
Well,
you can't point some shit out at 21.

1815
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:44,430
You're not seeing it was I going to 
listen to you.

1816
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:49,600
You're not going to listen to you unless
you're some super genius and even then 

1817
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,110
it's probably not going to be funny.
You know,

1818
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:53,760
I just,
uh,

1819
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:57,530
I wrestled with it for awhile.
I was a roofer after I got locked up.

1820
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:01,480
I roof for one week,
fucking two or three years I was,

1821
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:06,260
I went to school and then I was sick and
tired of people telling me try it.

1822
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:12,010
I was getting breakfast one morning,
opened up a paper and there was a be a 

1823
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:13,310
standup comedian class for $33 and I 
took it.

1824
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:16,490
I was not funny at all.
I was not a funny person.

1825
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,450
I wasn't funny until I started doing 
taekwondo and we would fight and compete

1826
01:18:20,451 --> 01:18:22,120
in tournaments and everybody be nervous.

1827
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,980
You'd be nervous even in the locker room
when you're about to go work out because

1828
01:18:24,981 --> 01:18:27,080
somebody might just get kicked in the 
face and knocked out.

1829
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:32,140
It happened all the time.
Guys got knocked out in class all the 

1830
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,501
time.
They get kicked in the face and you'd 

1831
01:18:35,501 --> 01:18:37,480
get fucking terrified and so I was 
always cracking jokes to break the 

1832
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,571
tension.
I was always the guy who's doing 

1833
01:18:40,571 --> 01:18:42,341
impressions of other people on the team.
That was the first time that I became 

1834
01:18:42,341 --> 01:18:43,430
funny because the other than that,
I just.

1835
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:46,010
I didn't think I was funny like loved 
comedy though,

1836
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:46,970
man.
God Damn.

1837
01:18:46,971 --> 01:18:48,890
I just thought the idea of it was so 
crazy.

1838
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,680
The first time I saw Richard Pryor live 
in the sunset strip,

1839
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:54,350
I couldn't fucking believe this guy was 
just talking.

1840
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:59,710
He's on stage just talking.
It was one of the most profound moments 

1841
01:18:59,710 --> 01:18:59,710
of my young life.

1842
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:00,660
I was like 13,
I think I was in the audience.

1843
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:05,680
I was just looking around and people 
were falling out of their chairs 

1844
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,891
laughing and I was holding my stomach.
Remember my stomach was hurting because 

1845
01:19:08,891 --> 01:19:09,380
I was laughing so hard and I was 
thinking,

1846
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,690
how crazy is that?
This guy's just talking.

1847
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:17,080
He's just talking and what he's saying 
is way funnier than any movie I've ever 

1848
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,171
seen.
I was thinking of stripes at the time 

1849
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:20,171
because stripes was this amazing movie,
you know,

1850
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:24,341
Bill Murray,
the funniest guy ever and Chevy Chase 

1851
01:19:24,341 --> 01:19:24,341
and then together in this movie and it's
incredible.

1852
01:19:24,341 --> 01:19:26,210
This was way funnier and this is just a 
guy talking.

1853
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,440
He was just to delirious is what got me 
and I was like 13,

1854
01:19:30,441 --> 01:19:35,441
12 or 13 when that came out and me and 
my brother watched it at his 

1855
01:19:35,441 --> 01:19:37,430
girlfriend's house,
who's who lived with her mom and we were

1856
01:19:37,431 --> 01:19:38,930
watching it with my brother's 
girlfriend.

1857
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,860
We were fucking buying because they are 
the only ones that had like it was a VCR

1858
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,890
or something.
No one had vcs we were dying to.

1859
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:49,990
Then the mom came home and we stop 
laughing and she was standing right 

1860
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:50,060
there.
We did.

1861
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:51,020
We just froze.
We're like,

1862
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,660
oh shit,
we're going to get busted.

1863
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,430
Destruction.
Yes.

1864
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:59,650
She stood there.
Her fucking Eddie Murphy go off and she 

1865
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:00,050
didn't say shit.
She doesn't.

1866
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,770
She didn't say hi or nothing.
She would fuck.

1867
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,910
We didn't laugh at all.
She went upstairs,

1868
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:08,550
Pam,
and then when that was the funniest shit

1869
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
ever,
ever delirious was at the time and he 

1870
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,200
was.
He took it to a whole new level of 

1871
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:17,200
destruction.
That terrible.

1872
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,540
Now that it's not good.
Funny.

1873
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,190
Is it funny?
When I was a kid,

1874
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:21,420
man,
that was the best shit.

1875
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:23,670
As the greatest comedy does not hold up,
man.

1876
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,510
It is not.
A lot of.

1877
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:28,500
It does not hold up and most old standup
comedian ever wants to like some old bob

1878
01:20:28,501 --> 01:20:29,040
hope.
Shit.

1879
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,500
It'll make you want to jump out the 
fucking window.

1880
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:36,060
Lenny Bruce.
What's out of this fucking hole?

1881
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:38,190
I still got so much shit that was 
timeless.

1882
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:41,370
Timeless is early.
Kinison will always be lenny.

1883
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:43,410
Bruce has a few timeless moments.
He's got this.

1884
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:44,740
He goes,
homosexual.

1885
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,650
You wanna make homosexuals illegal.
So dig this.

1886
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:51,651
This is what they do.
They take a guy who's gay and they put 

1887
01:20:51,651 --> 01:20:51,651
him in prison with a bunch of guys who 
want to have sex with him.

1888
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:54,830
I mean,
come on man,

1889
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,100
he knocked that shit out of the park in 
like 1950.

1890
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:58,240
But you know what,
that's funny.

1891
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:03,260
That's funny.
That would stand up now when you go dig 

1892
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:03,260
this man.
Take this bad.

1893
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,460
So catch this.
But towards the end he went crazy.

1894
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,200
Towards the end,
he would just go on stage with his legal

1895
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:09,090
papers and read from his legal 
documents.

1896
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,490
He was out of his mind.
He was fucking nuts riding.

1897
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,470
That's another,
that's another classic.

1898
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:15,330
Lenny Bruce.
There's not that many.

1899
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:17,170
Oh,
uh,

1900
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:18,690
yeah.
He had one about a.

1901
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,910
He goes out Catholics manner.
I don't think they get it,

1902
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:21,990
you know,
it's like,

1903
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,980
uh,
you know,

1904
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,990
Jesus comes back,
he wants to see a cross.

1905
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:27,960
It's like a guy walking around with an 
electric chair around his neck.

1906
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,240
So let me ask you something.
Let me boost it.

1907
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:31,200
That first.
Yes,

1908
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,690
yes,
yes,

1909
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:34,690
yes.
Wow.

1910
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,530
Yeah.
That was lenny Bruce's chuck.

1911
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:37,950
Wow.
That's pretty deep.

1912
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,660
What I seen,
what I heard,

1913
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:43,650
bicentennial Nigga and I said,
Richard Pryor,

1914
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,150
son from that

1915
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:50,860
I remember so many classic,
we'd have to look at it because he has 

1916
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:56,031
one from.
You'd have to see the best one from 

1917
01:21:56,031 --> 01:21:56,031
whatever it is.
Hey Man.

1918
01:21:56,031 --> 01:21:57,740
Say Nigga you went to Cape.
Why your window?

1919
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,360
What's your name?
Boy Dracula.

1920
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:03,320
What kind of name is that for a Nigga 
from Transylvania.

1921
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:08,520
I know where this Nigga.
You ain't the smartest motherfucker in 

1922
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:08,520
the world,
you know,

1923
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:08,520
but you're the ugliest.
Oh yes.

1924
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,250
You're ugly motherfucker.
And what's that then on the back of your

1925
01:22:10,251 --> 01:22:12,290
neck.
You are filthy little motherfucker too.

1926
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,880
You better go home before the sun come 
up.

1927
01:22:13,881 --> 01:22:15,840
I ain't lying.
See you're asking where you live.

1928
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:20,870
Look at arrested.
You want to suck but suck some black 

1929
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:20,870
niggas.
You use some kind of freak boy.

1930
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:25,330
Ugly Freak.
Oh crap.

1931
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:28,310
That was my heart was my heart guys.
I listened to that.

1932
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:32,160
He had bone in there.
All Bonnie's restaurant.

1933
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:37,170
Give me another,
another beautiful one more soundbite.

1934
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:40,190
Our gang mud bone goes to Hollywood.
Chinese restaurant.

1935
01:22:40,191 --> 01:22:45,191
Where he told I knew Jesus.
I met that Nigga at the railroad depot.

1936
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:51,550
I told them,
don't you go down there messing with 

1937
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,381
them Jews without no money.
Fire was the gene was great,

1938
01:22:57,471 --> 01:23:02,471
but bison today with it,
he goes to the baptism in the face like 

1939
01:23:02,471 --> 01:23:05,380
a lion and a body like a separate.
I don't know about you but don't want to

1940
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:05,590
see.
No,

1941
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:06,010
motherfucker got

1942
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:09,400
it looks like that.
You're fine man.

1943
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,870
When I was a kid,
when I was in high school,

1944
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:15,910
my me and my girlfriend Bethany,
we used to come home from high school 

1945
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,620
and I had a cassette player when 
listening to Richard Pryor cassettes and

1946
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:20,740
just giggle because we knew it shouldn't
be listening to this.

1947
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:24,310
Just giggle and laugh it dude.
There was this guy that I worked at ups.

1948
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:29,311
We work next to each other on and and on
an assembly line when we're sorting 

1949
01:23:29,311 --> 01:23:34,021
boxes it's just we're just fucking a 
conveyor belt with boxes and we'll just 

1950
01:23:34,021 --> 01:23:34,640
of dude,
dude,

1951
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:39,150
that's a shift from 2:30
to 7:30.

1952
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:44,170
That was my life was waking up at 1:30
1:32.

1953
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:47,830
I kept that job today.
They would have paid job for that.

1954
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:50,890
Was that just got bought out by buddy?
Did that.

1955
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,020
Can you imagine you had the same job 
since high school?

1956
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:58,080
Oh my God.
Would have to go on a level of 15 and 

1957
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,020
worked till three as a senior in Judea,
but guess what?

1958
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:02,420
When ups went public,
they paid that motherfucker $3,000,000

1959
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:05,590
million.
They went public because he had 30 years

1960
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:07,290
of stocks.
They were just giving away stops,

1961
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,160
like just give this guy.
He's a part time,

1962
01:24:09,161 --> 01:24:11,380
but it was a nightmare.
Man.

1963
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:16,400
I must felt that so much.
When he stopped talking to his brother 

1964
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:16,400
and everything,
just stopped talking to his brother.

1965
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,340
The brother called was like,
Bro,

1966
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:19,110
where they have business investment 
opportunities.

1967
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:21,910
We'll talk people.
Always a business investment.

1968
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:23,600
I was telling him,
you know,

1969
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,250
there was this guy lost his black guy 
that I worked next to.

1970
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:27,700
We fought a lot,
man.

1971
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:30,670
We've had box wars and shit.
It's a long story man.

1972
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:35,880
He was pissed off.
The conveyor belt was busier than mine 

1973
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:35,880
and I was the new guy.

1974
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,630
He was fucking pissed,
but anyways,

1975
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:41,470
he would always have a ghetto box and he
fucking played.

1976
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,710
Andrew is a black guy named Phil 
Collins,

1977
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:49,810
a black guy named Phil calls.
He was always angry that he got the belt

1978
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:54,900
boxes were coming.
I go through a boxes at me and shit and 

1979
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:54,900
I felt like,
God damn it,

1980
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,020
this sucks.
I got to quit.

1981
01:24:56,170 --> 01:25:01,170
But anyways,
he would always play Andrew dice clay 

1982
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:02,911
and ghetto box.
He knew Andrew dice clay every yet at 

1983
01:25:02,911 --> 01:25:04,630
that point it was like 1990.
Andrew dice clay had a couple of.

1984
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:07,570
He had a few cds at that point.
He knew everything.

1985
01:25:07,571 --> 01:25:09,990
He would put a different one the day the
laughter died.

1986
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:15,060
Oh,
he was just going back and forth and it 

1987
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:15,060
was,
you know,

1988
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:16,390
um,
that's my story about and a comedy.

1989
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,570
I got to tell Joe while we're on the 
subject and it's very interesting.

1990
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:25,200
I used to always tell you about ups.
People always telling me how they used 

1991
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,081
to ship ship.
I'll use pdfs and I take them aside and 

1992
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:28,081
go,
don't ship on ups because I.

1993
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:32,731
my buddy's ran the,
the paramus one and they have a little 

1994
01:25:32,731 --> 01:25:37,651
gate where they have rolexes and 
diamonds because they ship all the 

1995
01:25:37,651 --> 01:25:38,350
world's diamonds on ups.
A lot of people don't know that and they

1996
01:25:38,351 --> 01:25:40,330
have a gate,
so when that bell goes off,

1997
01:25:40,331 --> 01:25:43,990
that means security gate go opens and 
they would have these conveyor belts and

1998
01:25:43,991 --> 01:25:45,710
these guys would have to switch it up.
Yep.

1999
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,760
Well my buddies would take shit and 
throw it under the conveyor belt and it 

2000
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,280
would get stuck in rip open.
The dude I got.

2001
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:58,281
I got shit to show up with Rolex 
presidential bitches and they were 

2002
01:25:59,771 --> 01:26:02,290
selling them for 10 k cash other than 
three a week,

2003
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,600
making 8:50
of our ups selling three.

2004
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,600
President may not know there was so many
getting stolen because they were 

2005
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,090
uninsurance anyway for surveillance 
cameras,

2006
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:19,270
cameras rip open because the boxes will 
just want to take the box and thrown on 

2007
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:20,230
the floor.
They have tracking numbers and shit.

2008
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:23,330
They know where it stopped.
They would take the box and throw it and

2009
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:28,331
the conveyor belt so the belt would 
break it open and then it would say the 

2010
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:29,900
watch got that,
but just some pieces go get it.

2011
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:33,200
The watch was in there fucking pocket 
with the warranty and everything.

2012
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,660
So a $20,000
watch that you would.

2013
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,400
They would sell three a week.
These kids,

2014
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,250
each of them look yanking 90 grand a 
week out of that,

2015
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,400
plus diamonds plus anything else that 
came out of fuck ups,

2016
01:26:43,401 --> 01:26:48,401
those stocks,
the good old days was the worst job 

2017
01:26:48,401 --> 01:26:48,401
ever.
You don't move.

2018
01:26:48,401 --> 01:26:48,980
You don't stop moving.

2019
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:52,280
It was so bad that the position I had,
I thought it was a promotion,

2020
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:56,360
like I thought it was moving up in ups 
and the way you get into ups.

2021
01:26:56,361 --> 01:27:01,361
It's hard because I was working as a 
temp at the United States post office 

2022
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:03,710
and that she was only six months a year,
something like that and it was coming to

2023
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:06,260
and so I had to get another job,
so I had people that worked at ups.

2024
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:06,800
They go,
dude,

2025
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:12,130
try ups.
It's going to be really hard to get in 

2026
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:14,701
though.
They hire three out of 30 people that 

2027
01:27:14,701 --> 01:27:16,901
they come in,
they bring 30 people in this higher 

2028
01:27:16,901 --> 01:27:16,901
three and I'm like,
dude,

2029
01:27:16,901 --> 01:27:17,700
it's,
they're looking for warriors.

2030
01:27:17,701 --> 01:27:18,650
Dude,
it's really hard.

2031
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,500
It's really hard to 30 to 7:30
and they work you for hours,

2032
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:26,501
like a fucking dog.
Eight bucks an hour and minimum wage 

2033
01:27:26,501 --> 01:27:26,501
back then was 3:35.

2034
01:27:26,501 --> 01:27:28,160
So it was like,
I want that fucking money,

2035
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:33,490
you know?
So I went in there and just bullshitted 

2036
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:33,550
my way through and I went to the fucking
interview and,

2037
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:38,590
and they go,
why do you think you're good for this 

2038
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:40,901
job?
I love working in the middle of it 

2039
01:27:40,901 --> 01:27:40,901
graveyard shift.
I'm always up.

2040
01:27:40,901 --> 01:27:45,590
I have so much energy.
I just want to so much energy at that 

2041
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,590
time.
I'd love hard work.

2042
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:47,870
I don't want to work retail and deal 
with people I want to work in the back.

2043
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,450
So basically what I did was like what 
you would do to a chick.

2044
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,100
You try to pretend that you're something
you're not.

2045
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:53,060
Yes,
totally.

2046
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:54,940
When did they?
They,

2047
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:55,390
they,
they,

2048
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:58,460
they called the three finalists and it 
was one of them was me and I'm like,

2049
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,530
fuck yeah.
I came in,

2050
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:02,720
I knew I just bullshitted my way 
through.

2051
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,150
You guys had finalists and there was 
three of them.

2052
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:08,750
Three out of 30 people,
they fucking called Our Name.

2053
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:10,610
We fucking come in and then they take 
us.

2054
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:15,640
They give us on,
give us a tour of ups isn't tremendous 

2055
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:16,970
warehouse did you say?
I really think that my career is here.

2056
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,140
Yes.
All that shit.

2057
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:21,020
All that shit.
I can see the quote retiring with ups.

2058
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,500
So at first when you first come in,
this is 1:30,

2059
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:29,501
you're unloading semis.
Their first job is you get in the semi 

2060
01:28:29,501 --> 01:28:30,260
though to worse motherfuck there's all 
these semis and go,

2061
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:35,261
you're a part of the semi crew,
you're just putting fucking boxes on 

2062
01:28:35,261 --> 01:28:37,010
conveyor belts and another conveyor 
comes up and then the first guy sorts it

2063
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:40,340
by zip code and he has a bunch of belts 
behind him and he's going for.

2064
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,460
So I'm in a fucking truck going flocked,
working hard going,

2065
01:28:43,461 --> 01:28:44,600
I got to get out of this fucking truck.

2066
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:49,600
I need to be on the sword is all the 
dust and here this is for the fucking 

2067
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:49,600
slaves.
Fuck this shit.

2068
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,740
So finally they bumped up.
Now I'm a splitter and they time your 

2069
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:53,740
ass.
They timed.

2070
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:54,600
They're like hiding in the conveyor 
belt.

2071
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:59,330
How many packages can you.
Oh to go dude.

2072
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:02,610
You can't think you're like there's nine
belts behind you and you're like fucking

2073
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:05,670
going crazy.
But I would know when they were watching

2074
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,020
I would know.
I was like,

2075
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:08,910
I'm like,
I'm like always looking around,

2076
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:10,980
always looking on my,
Oh this motherfucker going to me.

2077
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,270
I would miss sort everything.

2078
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:17,520
I was just missed sorting shit.
They don't know who the fuck Miss Swartz

2079
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,520
Shit.
And after we would have our meeting or 

2080
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:22,520
was a great day.
You guys did great.

2081
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,420
Like the team leader.
Fucking Edgar Bravo again.

2082
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,760
The record holder for the day.
The guy's on fire,

2083
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:29,110
he's doing great.
I was the fucking dude.

2084
01:29:29,111 --> 01:29:31,680
I was the man and you really sucked.
That wasn't that good.

2085
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:36,681
But I just can see them timing my ass.
And when it was time for the big 

2086
01:29:36,681 --> 01:29:36,681
promotion,
way up the conveyor belt,

2087
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:41,730
like the dude who sorts for the actual 
trucks that are going out the conveyor 

2088
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:41,730
belt,
they go,

2089
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:46,190
we go up the promotion,
goes to Edgar Bravo for his fantastic 

2090
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:47,430
work and it's fantastic times.
I'm like,

2091
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:50,710
Oh shit,
what a whack system.

2092
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:53,340
Definitely not know you're a horse horse
shit dude.

2093
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:58,610
It just whack those hilarity.
They don't get ms dot because there's 

2094
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:02,030
conveyor belts that go for fucking 
hundreds of yards and they've gone 

2095
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:02,030
through all this shit.

2096
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:06,410
It's complex.
By the time when down the road and the 

2097
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:09,351
conveyor belt,
they see a missort goes to the 

2098
01:30:09,351 --> 01:30:09,351
Minnesota,
Iowa and it comes all the way back.

2099
01:30:09,351 --> 01:30:10,890
They don't know who the fuck assorted.
They make mistakes all the time.

2100
01:30:10,891 --> 01:30:13,470
You don't know what the fuck's going on.
They're fucking idiots were.

2101
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:15,930
Anyways,
I thought I got a promotion,

2102
01:30:15,931 --> 01:30:20,931
got a fifty cent raise,
and I'm sitting there back to back like 

2103
01:30:20,931 --> 01:30:22,620
mere you're sorting for people behind 
you and I'm sorting for people behind me

2104
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:24,300
and it's me and Phil Collins and we're 
going,

2105
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:29,040
I'm the the reason the guy quit.
I didn't know he couldn't handle working

2106
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:31,150
with Phil Collins because Phil Collins 
is like,

2107
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:34,830
just this being fucking black guy.
That was really cool before work started

2108
01:30:34,831 --> 01:30:35,620
with everyone to.
Well,

2109
01:30:35,621 --> 01:30:37,140
what about the jets?
Oh my God.

2110
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:39,780
Did you see fucking boomer esiason?
He was on fire.

2111
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:42,330
Everybody was really fucking cool and at
2:00

2112
01:30:42,331 --> 01:30:43,920
in the morning,
but once it starts,

2113
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:47,840
you start fucking getting pissed and he 
would get pissed that I did that.

2114
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:52,910
I was getting help because I was new.
I was fucking out that the guys were 

2115
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:52,910
always helping me,
the managers,

2116
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:54,900
but they weren't helping him,
so fuck man.

2117
01:30:54,901 --> 01:30:56,880
It was the worst job ever.
I ended up quitting.

2118
01:30:56,940 --> 01:31:01,940
They were begging me to come back 
because to get a guy to get it takes 

2119
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:02,490
like two months to fucking have that 
shit wired.

2120
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,400
It takes a long time and until you get 
it wired,

2121
01:31:05,401 --> 01:31:07,620
the fucking guys got to help you.
The manager's got to help you.

2122
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:11,460
They don't want you to quit.
We just put an at fucking nine months in

2123
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:12,810
with you.
You better not quit.

2124
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:14,670
I would quit them were begging me to 
come back.

2125
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:15,570
I'm like,
I'm gone.

2126
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:17,430
My back hurts.
I faked a back injury.

2127
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:19,680
I just gave me the fuck outta here.
Well,

2128
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:23,310
we're all happy he did that because then
we would have lost him,

2129
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:23,620
Bro.
You.

2130
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:29,410
I would've been able to look ups.
Only a blue belt.

2131
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,830
You'll never gotten the Abu Dhabi fucked
up.

2132
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,820
Thank God for Phil Collins.
If you're out there.

2133
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:35,700
Thank you man.
Thank you.

2134
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:36,810

I don't remember because it too.

2136
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:44,350
Phil Collins is a drama.
Then there was a guitar player from

2137
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:46,470

2141

2142
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:04,650
Listening to let us get it.

2143
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:05,230

but I heard a free bird.

2144
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:07,300
Oh my God.
They fucking around though.

2145

my mother fought jam.

2148
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:21,640
That's an all time jam.

2149
01:32:21,890 --> 01:32:25,690
So once you got going on this weekend,

I was going to go to the south and I 
don't know what happened.

2151
01:32:27,521 --> 01:32:32,100
There was comedy hose temporarily down 
because he's got no liquor license.

2152
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,570
Just chillax and I got to keep writing.

01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,220
I still write every Monday I put them 
up.

2190
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,870
Where do you put them up?
My space.

2191
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:09,910
She's jealous on the Internet.
Still rocking my space because that's 

2192
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:10,940
where I started with that.
It's too hard to transfer moment.

2193
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:13,610
Have copy and paste list.
The problem I have,

2194
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,300
I have three different batches of 
people.

2195
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,830
My facebook has more family people like 
real quick and they know,

2196
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:23,460
but they don't know what I'm saying.
For the people.

2197
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:25,570
My people on here,
you motherfuckers are the best.

2198
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:30,780
I can talk about mass.
I can tell you about stabbing Puerto 

2199
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:30,780
Rican.
You guys are the best.

2200
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:31,120
My space.
I go all right,

2201
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:33,580
but there's nobody left.
It's like me and a couple people,

2202
01:34:33,581 --> 01:34:37,870
but I blog my space just because I 
started on it and sometimes I get.

2203
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:40,660
If I get a lot of hits real quick,
I put it on twitter or something because

2204
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:44,080
it's kind of weird how my space just 
fucking just hard.

2205
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:45,780
I've never seen anything like,
yeah,

2206
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:49,330
but if we got crushed,
I don't know about that.

2207
01:34:49,331 --> 01:34:51,820
We just keep moving.
I think facebook is a better product.

2208
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,430
Better.
I like my mind space.

2209
01:34:54,431 --> 01:34:59,431
I don't even put.
I don't even bother advertising for 

2210
01:34:59,431 --> 01:34:59,431
seminars at all,
you

2211
01:34:59,431 --> 01:34:59,431
know?
Yeah.

2212
01:34:59,431 --> 01:35:03,521
I don't.
I don't even touch my shows anymore on 

2213
01:35:03,521 --> 01:35:03,521
my space.
Just keep it up for the music.

2214
01:35:03,521 --> 01:35:03,521
People want to hear my music 
temporarily.

2215
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:05,210
My music's up on mind space.
That's it,

2216
01:35:05,211 --> 01:35:05,870
but I don't.
Fuck.

2217
01:35:05,871 --> 01:35:07,150
I don't fuck with the Jujitsu part of 
it.

2218
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:12,190
Facebook is just so much smarter with 
their updates and shit and go to your 

2219
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:12,260
timeline and see all this different shit
that's happening.

2220
01:35:12,261 --> 01:35:17,261
It's kind of interesting.
You know Bob's in a relationship with 

2221
01:35:17,261 --> 01:35:17,261
Lisa.
Oh,

2222
01:35:17,261 --> 01:35:17,261
no shit.
Huh?

2223
01:35:17,261 --> 01:35:19,320
Click this girl.
Busy body instead.

2224
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:21,080
Fucking looking through it.
Now.

2225
01:35:21,081 --> 01:35:26,081
The September 19th,

2229
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:40,010
Wrong man.
For some reason.

2230
01:35:40,011 --> 01:35:41,210
The 18th.
The 18th.

2231
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,050
Saturday.
Yeah.

2232
01:35:42,051 --> 01:35:47,051
The 18th is Rochester or the 19th is the
viper room viper room.

01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:12,530

I'm going to Rosemead oh shit.
Columbus.

2244
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:22,290
Columbus is September.
Columbus.

2245
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:27,530
Twentieth is probably Columbus Day.
October 10th is a something else.

2246
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:31,670
I guess also my new website's up.

2248
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:38,690

So a,

2249
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,940

Tenth Planet Jj Dot Com.

2250
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,980
Click techniques please.
Thank you.

2251
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:45,060
So,
uh,

2252
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:48,740
you chick fucking picked up for cocaine 
this weekend in Vegas.

2253
01:36:48,741 --> 01:36:50,770
That dubby Paris Hilton or.

2254
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:52,370
So what happened?
Her homeboy.

2255
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:53,750
This is what I tell you.
Don't smoke in the car.

2256
01:36:53,751 --> 01:36:56,060
Cock sucking,
smoke smoke in the car.

2257
01:36:56,430 --> 01:37:01,430
This is a running joke that Joey Diaz.
We'll just hop into a fucking car in the

2258
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:04,020
middle of a police parade.
It doesn't,

2259
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:05,970
it doesn't mean shit.
He'll just start lighting that.

2260
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:07,270
Where's the reef of cock?
Sucker.

2261
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:08,840
What are we doing there?
We playing games.

2262
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:10,520
They'll just start light and joints and 
I,

2263
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:13,850
I'm always thinking we're going to get 
pulled over and we're going to get,

2264
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:14,960
you know,
this is not good.

2265
01:37:14,961 --> 01:37:16,310
You're not supposed to smoke weed in the
car,

2266
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:18,740
so we should have a rule.
You should never smoke weed in the car.

2267
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:23,360
Don't smile while I'm driving too much.
Like an hour.

2268
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:24,770
You're,
you're vulnerable,

2269
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,400
you know?
Well,

2270
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,870
not only that,
it's just stupid.

2271
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:32,080
She was smoking,
the windows were open and the fucking 

2272
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,860
slope and there was a bike cop or 
something and he drove right by them and

2273
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,160
smell the weed,
the weed.

2274
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:37,520
So he pulls him over and finds coconut 
car,

2275
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:40,770
this bitch ass to go to the bathroom,
goes to the bathroom for guests.

2276
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:45,970
You know when you got pulled over,
the first thing you do is you take the 

2277
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:45,970
illegal substance,
putting your fucking snatch,

2278
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:47,600
especially if you're abroad.
If you're a guy pulling your ball sack,

2279
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,390
where did this happen?
Touched Vegas.

2280
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:51,730
Ooh,
she in jail.

2281
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:52,550
No,
no,

2282
01:37:52,551 --> 01:37:56,970
she got let out.
But grace was very upset.

2283
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Who is she to be let out of jail?
If it was you or I,

2284
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:07,250
we would be in there right now.
That's taken of Dr Phil.

2285
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:12,500
I bred some stuff.
Read tabloids that he's having trouble 

2286
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:12,500
with his wife.
Is that all bullshit?

2287
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,810
Is that bullshit or is that real?
What do you think is a fuck that?

2288
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:20,110
No,
I don't give a fuck like hundreds of 

2289
01:38:20,110 --> 01:38:24,560
millions of dollars.
And I pitched him pitches not knowing 

2290
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,200
what I'm saying is I don't give a fuck 
what anybody does in their own life with

2291
01:38:25,201 --> 01:38:25,590
their marriage.

2292
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:30,590
I don't wish any harm in their marriage.
I hope everyone has had that 

2293
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:31,350
motherfucker.
Dr Phil.

2294
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,560
I'm going to enjoy watching his life 
fall apart.

2295
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:36,540
Why?
He's a fucking idiot,

2296
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:37,500
man.
I hate that guy.

2297
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:38,550
Wow.
Strong word.

2298
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:41,550
I hate that fucking guy.
He's a fucking backstabber to the,

2299
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:42,720
to the,
um,

2300
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:45,810
the male gender.
Come on.

2301
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:48,720
That guy's the biggest fucking.
He's a writer.

2302
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,960
He's hustling whatever.
Everyday I'm hustling.

2303
01:38:51,961 --> 01:38:52,800
It's gonna.
Be Funny.

2304
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:57,801
Hustle.
It's going to be funny to catch him 

2305
01:38:57,801 --> 01:38:57,801
busted with hookers and shit.
That's going to be fucking huddle.

2306
01:38:57,801 --> 01:38:59,080
Every guest.
It's going to be interesting.

2307
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:04,220
What does happen to him?
He's going to have to be very careful 

2308
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:04,220
about his image.
If he does get divorced,

2309
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:05,700
he could be total horseshit and he could
be getting along with his wife.

2310
01:39:05,701 --> 01:39:10,701
Great.
But if he gets divorced and he's out 

2311
01:39:10,701 --> 01:39:10,701
there wilding,
he's out there,

2312
01:39:10,701 --> 01:39:11,030
Dayton,
because there's going to be bitches.

2313
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,840
I want to set them up and try to get on 
TMZ.

2314
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:15,930
How about the Dr Ferraro sketch that was
on the man show.

2315
01:39:15,931 --> 01:39:18,670
There was a two parter.
I mean that shit on the Manchester.

2316
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:23,220
It was a reality when a guy that was 
posing as a Dr Phil was,

2317
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:27,690
had a fake book signing and people up.
He was saying all kinds of crazy shit.

2318
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:27,930
Yeah,
like,

2319
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:29,480
like,
like the girls were aligned.

2320
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,320
They didn't even know it's him.
It looks like him.

2321
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:35,040
But I probably didn't fool everybody.
But man,

2322
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:36,090
it was a,
it was a total punk.

2323
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:38,410
Like he would say,
like when he was signing in,

2324
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:41,070
I got some coke back in the hotel room.
You down and curls.

2325
01:39:41,071 --> 01:39:45,540
But like yeah,
hit.

2326
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:51,620
And then he was,
he was making moves on this one chick 

2327
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:51,620
and from under the table a girl came 
out,

2328
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:55,790
like he had been getting a blow job and 
just walked away and he just kept 

2329
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:55,790
talking to him.

2330
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:55,790
You want to party,
get your friends.

2331
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:59,160
It's got like a telco and down at it 
was.

2332
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:00,820
It was so funny.
That's gets.

2333
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:03,570
It was so much material.
It was the only comedy.

2334
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:06,780
It was the only man show sketch that two
parts.

2335
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,810
They did it again the next week.
There was so much material.

2336
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:15,490
It was too funny.
If Stan up and I had a real show where 

2337
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:15,810
we could have really done what we wanted
to do,

2338
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:20,840
it could have been very interesting.
There was two problems with doing that 

2339
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,481
mantra.
One was and I was doing fear factor at 

2340
01:40:23,481 --> 01:40:23,481
the same time.
That was crazy day.

2341
01:40:23,481 --> 01:40:26,010
Easy days in the middle of all that man 
show shit.

2342
01:40:26,011 --> 01:40:28,200
I'm training for Abu Dhabi.
I'm looking for.

2343
01:40:28,201 --> 01:40:33,201
The man showed depressed out of my mind.
It was the worst from day one inside.

2344
01:40:33,211 --> 01:40:34,620
I wanted to kill myself.
I'm like,

2345
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:37,020
this fucking is not what I thought it 
was going to be.

2346
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:39,670
Started out what it was supposed to be,
was supposed to be.

2347
01:40:39,671 --> 01:40:41,070
We would be able to do whatever we 
wanted.

2348
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,830
The way they sold it to me was the 
beginning.

2349
01:40:43,831 --> 01:40:46,020
Explain the beginning how they offered 
you the show while you.

2350
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:48,720
Here I was doing fear factor and they 
were saying we want you to take over the

2351
01:40:48,721 --> 01:40:50,040
man show,
and I was like,

2352
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,200
Woo Hoo Hoo.
In they as well,

2353
01:40:52,201 --> 01:40:54,040
we have a short list people.
Is there anybody that you would

2354
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,090
want to do it with?
And I'm like,

2355
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:57,100
there's only one guy doug stanhope.
I go,

2356
01:40:57,101 --> 01:40:58,590
that's the only way it would work.
I go,

2357
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:01,720
he's the only guy that's like,
that fits right in there with me,

2358
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:03,880
like my sensitivity,
my sensibility rather.

2359
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,060
And so,
uh,

2360
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:05,860
they said,
well,

2361
01:41:05,861 --> 01:41:06,940
you guys would be perfect.
You can do it.

2362
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:08,320
I'm like,
but it would be too restrictive.

2363
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:08,740
They're like,
no,

2364
01:41:08,741 --> 01:41:08,880
no,
no,

2365
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:09,580
no,
you don't understand.

2366
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:12,820
A lawsuit would be good for us.
The Guy Actually said this to me.

2367
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:14,650
He said if we got sued,
okay,

2368
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:16,810
it would be great publicity.
It would be great.

2369
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:19,720
Want to do we want to do nudity,
blur it out.

2370
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:21,250
If you want to swear,
beep it out.

2371
01:41:21,251 --> 01:41:24,340
Essentially you could do anything that 
you would talk about an real quick.

2372
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:28,300
We already had like 10,
15 ideas for sketches even before that.

2373
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:29,770
So this was like a perfect thing.

2374
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:31,060
I remember you called me go,
dude,

2375
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:33,730
the fuck comedy central wants me to take
over the man show.

2376
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:35,590
How fucking crazy is that?
We were just.

2377
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:36,790
We were thinking.
So anyway,

2378
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:37,690
what happened was,
yeah,

2379
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:42,720
totally it was.
It was very strange and they came up to 

2380
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:45,541
me and they basically just gave us a 
story about what they're going to be 

2381
01:41:45,541 --> 01:41:45,580
able to do for us.
We're going to have some show.

2382
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:47,560
It's going to be completely wild.
You can do whatever you want,

2383
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:50,200
but once we got in there,
it was a completely different story.

2384
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:54,160
They had like really restricted ideas 
about what the subject matter should be.

2385
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:59,420
The guy who was the executive producer 
wind up like kind of hijacking the show 

2386
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:02,761
and taking all the things on his 
direction and this is the guy that me 

2387
01:42:02,761 --> 01:42:02,940
and doug hired.
He had his own hire.

2388
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,060
The head writer slash hated you.

2389
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:06,430
You and him.
You remember that,

2390
01:42:06,431 --> 01:42:07,960
right?
Remember that?

2391
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:13,050
The head writer,
I remember you going out to dinner 

2392
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:13,050
because Deborah,
before you signed,

2393
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:13,600
you were like,
let me pick the head writer.

2394
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:16,150
You said,
can I hire my guys?

2395
01:42:16,151 --> 01:42:18,070
I'm going to bring in my guy.
What was your guys' name?

2396
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,690
The Bald Guy?
The comedian mcguire?

2397
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:24,100
Yes.
You wanted to bring in Chris Mcguire and

2398
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:26,870
Maddie Kirsch and me and they said,
no,

2399
01:42:26,871 --> 01:42:27,010
no,
no,

2400
01:42:27,011 --> 01:42:28,360
whatever you want to do,
man,

2401
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:31,870
whatever it's going to have total power.
You have total power do.

2402
01:42:31,871 --> 01:42:32,740
And you're like,
damn.

2403
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:33,780
And you're calling me.
He'll do.

2404
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:35,570
They give them a total fucking power.
It's good.

2405
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:40,580
Well,
I want to be able to hire the head 

2406
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:41,731
writer.
You went out and met with some guys and 

2407
01:42:41,731 --> 01:42:41,800
you met with Janice.
Not Get too into this.

2408
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:42,730
Um,
I,

2409
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:47,900
I know what you're saying,
but I don't want to throw Tom Johnson 

2410
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:47,900
under the bus.

2411
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,730
I think he's a talented guy.
He just did what he thought was the 

2412
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:50,730
right show and I wasn't there.
Well,

2413
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:55,050
I wasn't there in the network.
Had real serious ideas about what they 

2414
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:55,050
wanted and you know,
they,

2415
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:59,380
they,
they were the ones running the show and 

2416
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:00,901
coming up with the money and they had 
some real serious ideas about what they 

2417
01:43:00,901 --> 01:43:03,301
thought was funny.
And one of them was they didn't want 

2418
01:43:03,301 --> 01:43:05,041
joey on the show and I want joe to come 
out at the beginning of the show naked 

2419
01:43:05,041 --> 01:43:05,800
and introduce everybody.
He would come out with a microphone,

2420
01:43:05,801 --> 01:43:08,320
the handheld microphone.
Let's get this party started.

2421
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:13,480
And Joe is dancing and everything.
It was probably one of the funniest 

2422
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,410
things we ever did.
And they fought to the point of tears.

2423
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,530
This fucking chick who I like,
very nice person,

2424
01:43:17,531 --> 01:43:19,000
she's an executive.
She's telling me,

2425
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,050
why is that funny?

2426
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:22,090
I'm like,
how could it not be funny?

2427
01:43:22,091 --> 01:43:23,550
I go,
you're going to get Joey Diaz.

2428
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,630
He's going to run out naked.
You pixelate his balls.

2429
01:43:25,631 --> 01:43:30,631
The crowd's going to go crazy.
It's going to put them in the perfect 

2430
01:43:30,631 --> 01:43:30,631
mood.
I just don't see how this is funny.

2431
01:43:30,631 --> 01:43:31,050
I don't see others.
It's funny.

2432
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,920
Tears are coming down her eyes.
I go,

2433
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:35,500
we'll do two intros.
We'll do one without it and we'll do one

2434
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:37,720
with it.
We do one without you go out there.

2435
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:41,650
The fucking place goes ape shit.
They are falling down laughing.

2436
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:43,360
It was hilarious.
The best intro ever.

2437
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:46,420
And I got that on camera.
So then I go to her and I'm like,

2438
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:47,320
you know,
raise my hands.

2439
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:51,860
I've see told you like you got to.
I know what I is funny.

2440
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,590
I'm capable of reproducing what I think 
is funny.

2441
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,540
You might not think it's funny on paper.

2442
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,580
You might not think.
It's funny as I'm describing it to you,

2443
01:43:58,581 --> 01:44:03,581
but I know it's funny to me and if it's 
funny to me it's going to be funny to 

2444
01:44:03,581 --> 01:44:04,970
other people.
It just has to be the second it was that

2445
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,110
went to college for four years.
Why?

2446
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:10,450
The reason Chappelle quit because you've
got to buy it.

2447
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:15,460
Turned out it was the reason why Adam 
Carolla and Jimmy Jimmy Kimmel stopped 

2448
01:44:16,101 --> 01:44:17,180
doing it.
It's because they,

2449
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:22,380
they gave up ownership of the show so 
that they could have creative control 

2450
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:24,500
they gave up on because they're tired of
these idiots and they gave up.

2451
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:25,310
They were like,
look,

2452
01:44:25,311 --> 01:44:25,700
look,
look,

2453
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:30,730
you guys can have the fucking show.
We just want to be responsible for what 

2454
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:33,581
gets done.
And they for sure didn't want to hire 

2455
01:44:33,581 --> 01:44:33,581
me.
They said,

2456
01:44:33,581 --> 01:44:33,581
no,
no,

2457
01:44:33,581 --> 01:44:33,581
no.
Once you signed,

2458
01:44:33,581 --> 01:44:38,201
they go.
Now this Eddie Bravo has no TV 

2459
01:44:38,201 --> 01:44:38,201
experience,
why the fuck do we want him on the show?

2460
01:44:38,201 --> 01:44:38,750
And they're like,
no,

2461
01:44:38,751 --> 01:44:40,880
we're not gonna hire them with higher 
Chris Mcguire and bought out.

2462
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:45,910
But no,
the problem was they didn't understand 

2463
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:45,910
what I was trying to do.
I was trying to.

2464
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:45,980
I was like,
look,

2465
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:47,210
he's.
He says funny shit.

2466
01:44:47,211 --> 01:44:50,900
He comes up with some funny ideas.
He might not be like a writer in,

2467
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:53,090
in as far as like,
he's not going to come up with a,

2468
01:44:53,091 --> 01:44:55,470
a properly formatted sketch,
you know,

2469
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:57,470
without everything.
I mean he could eventually do that,

2470
01:44:57,471 --> 01:44:59,810
but for right now what he's good at,
he's good at looking at things,

2471
01:44:59,811 --> 01:45:00,770
funny,
smoking pot,

2472
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,580
coming up with crazy ideas and you 
could,

2473
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:04,350
you know,
there's a tailor and having a.

2474
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,890
They weren't hearing it.
You got to us it was,

2475
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:09,590
he wanted it to be his show and I wasn't
there enough.

2476
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:11,750
I was doing fear factor at least three 
days a week.

2477
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:16,340
So for three days they would be running 
the show and Doug did not feel confident

2478
01:45:16,341 --> 01:45:18,530
enough to take over and he would send me
messages.

2479
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:19,850
He would call me up and go,
dude,

2480
01:45:19,851 --> 01:45:22,220
is fucking hell here.
This is just driving me crazy.

2481
01:45:22,221 --> 01:45:26,000
It's just fucking stupid sketches 
getting in and I can't get this done.

2482
01:45:26,001 --> 01:45:31,001
And,
and then the Janet Jackson Nipple thing 

2483
01:45:31,001 --> 01:45:32,870
happened and then we were fucked because
then shit that we already had approved,

2484
01:45:32,871 --> 01:45:36,290
they yanked out,
they pulled shit out of episodes because

2485
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:41,291
after that Janet Jackson Nipple fiasco,
people don't know who weren't in show 

2486
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:42,560
tilts.
A lot of people was nothing.

2487
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,060
Some chick poser tit out in a video or 
you know,

2488
01:45:45,061 --> 01:45:46,430
in a,
in a super bowl thing rather.

2489
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:47,450
And it's like,
who cares?

2490
01:45:47,451 --> 01:45:48,830
It's kind of gross.
It was stupid,

2491
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,490
you know,
they did something.

2492
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:51,530
It's over,
you know,

2493
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:52,510
but to the,
to,

2494
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:57,600
to Hollywood that costs people money.
People worried about sponsors pulling 

2495
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:01,181
out,
people worried about losing commercial 

2496
01:46:01,181 --> 01:46:02,981
money and they acted man.
They started chopping up sketches and 

2497
01:46:02,981 --> 01:46:04,310
removing bits and everybody went on a 
panic.

2498
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:06,620
They were all sheep.
They just went on this panic.

2499
01:46:06,621 --> 01:46:08,510
Sheep run,
banging into walls,

2500
01:46:08,511 --> 01:46:10,760
tripping over themselves,
trying to stop comedy.

2501
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:15,080
How about the sketch that we wrote that 
they originally approved and they backed

2502
01:46:15,081 --> 01:46:20,081
out of.
We were going to do extreme sack 

2503
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:20,081
fighting.

2504
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:22,400
It was funny because I never forget the 
day that that all went down.

2505
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:24,170
I,
between you,

2506
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,930
me and all three of us and I didn't want
to fucking be there either.

2507
01:46:27,190 --> 01:46:28,880
It was the worst fucking thing.
I was around.

2508
01:46:28,881 --> 01:46:30,170
It was a bad energy,
right?

2509
01:46:30,171 --> 01:46:31,480
It was set up that energy.
No,

2510
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,540
forget that.
I went.

2511
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:35,720
They made me rehearse like Jack Offs 
that they were.

2512
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,250
And uh,
the guy,

2513
01:46:37,251 --> 01:46:38,840
Tom,
Janice came over and oh,

2514
01:46:38,841 --> 01:46:40,250
it's hysterical.
We love it.

2515
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,900
Then the next day I go there and now 
everybody's talking about it.

2516
01:46:42,901 --> 01:46:47,901
It was hysterical to see all these 
fucking educated white people walking 

2517
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:48,710
around like they didn't know what the 
fuck to do.

2518
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:49,980
He's gonna take his balls

2519
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,350
up and he's going to run.
They got killed and that's it.

2520
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:55,710
So they all were arguing,
see direction.

2521
01:46:55,711 --> 01:46:57,890
We want to go in.
This is like a fucking whore.

2522
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,880
It's not want a job.
Push this through with all his might do.

2523
01:47:02,210 --> 01:47:03,840
This is not a direction we want to go 
in.

2524
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:07,380
Hired me to do what I think is funny.
Tell me what to do.

2525
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:09,450
Some crazy shit.
We're gonna do some crazy shit.

2526
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:14,780
And then they wanted me to be a junkie,
a man junkie and take a piss and I'm 

2527
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:14,820
like crack.
And I was like,

2528
01:47:14,821 --> 01:47:17,020
this ain't gonna happen.
Yeah.

2529
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:22,060
They're like,
we want them to know makeup and 

2530
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:22,060
everything.
When Joey came running out,

2531
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:25,280
all bets were off,
so I had to shut up or at least that 

2532
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:28,191
day.
So we had to shoot two episodes that 

2533
01:47:28,191 --> 01:47:30,170
day.
We had to shoot two episodes and I was 

2534
01:47:30,170 --> 01:47:30,170
going to run through both of them,
but even after the first one,

2535
01:47:30,170 --> 01:47:31,770
even after they seen the laughter,
they were like,

2536
01:47:31,771 --> 01:47:32,760
it's not going to happen.

2537
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
But what got me was I'm not familiar 
with this environment of a fucking 

2538
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,210
standup comic at the time.
I had done a couple things,

2539
01:47:39,211 --> 01:47:42,740
but I wasn't familiar with the whole 
other side of this big Hollywood butches

2540
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:45,690
lying.
So the guy who was telling me to my face

2541
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:48,350
how funny I am,
I catch them when I get offstage.

2542
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:53,650
Telling the comedy central people that 
it was tasteless and he thought it was 

2543
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:55,500
terrible and he said,
tell Rogan how my balls aren't funny and

2544
01:47:55,501 --> 01:48:00,501
I must've dude and all of a sudden look 
at him and I fucking was raging and as 

2545
01:48:00,501 --> 01:48:05,151
I'm at the end of the show I'm side.
And what really happened was because I 

2546
01:48:05,151 --> 01:48:08,451
don't give a fuck,
I was smoking a joint with the security 

2547
01:48:08,451 --> 01:48:08,790
guard.
Got a joy run on the set,

2548
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:10,670
you know,
I don't give a fuck and me and this.

2549
01:48:10,671 --> 01:48:11,970
The security goes like what you're 
doing.

2550
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:12,920
I go smoke it.
You.

2551
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:15,330
Once we went into a little nook and 
cranny on a Saturday.

2552
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:20,540
Remember they taped on a Saturday and we
sparked up and we got really fucking 

2553
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:20,580
hot.
So now I walk in,

2554
01:48:20,581 --> 01:48:22,440
I got to put up with all that,
cut Judy Brown,

2555
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:24,300
all that shit.
I'll say this cause I don't give a fuck.

2556
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:27,390
I walk in and the guy comes and he goes 
to me.

2557
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,000
That was hilarious.
And I stopped and I go,

2558
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:33,090
how can you say that to me?
How can you say that to me?

2559
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:38,420
I just see you with my own eyes telling 
the people what that wasn't funny and he

2560
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:41,880
didn't see you when you were saying he 
didn't see me.

2561
01:48:42,530 --> 01:48:44,460
So like,
well how can you fucking say that to me?

2562
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:45,480
He goes,
I go,

2563
01:48:45,481 --> 01:48:47,360
as a matter of fact,
I'm going to go in there and tell John.

2564
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:52,370
He goes,
you're going to go tell joe so you're 

2565
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:52,370
fired.
I go,

2566
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:52,370
really?
Come in.

2567
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:52,370
I fucking go to smack.
You don't look.

2568
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:54,780
I don't give a fuck that guys are 
buzzing with his fucking bike.

2569
01:48:54,781 --> 01:48:57,330
He's a white biker.
I'll still smack your fucking mouth.

2570
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:04,460
He goes outside.
He thought he was bad to the bone with 

2571
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:04,460
his bike.
He's one of these bikers from Malibu.

2572
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:09,480
Probably can suck my dick.
So the funny thing is he's outside by 

2573
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:12,561
the pipe.
That's when I went to hit him by the 

2574
01:49:12,561 --> 01:49:14,901
pipe and he hit his head with a pipe and
we're outside and he's sitting there 

2575
01:49:14,901 --> 01:49:15,480
like,
I'm not going back on this.

2576
01:49:15,481 --> 01:49:20,481
Joe is leaves you a fucking man and 
you're sitting by a pipe like a little 

2577
01:49:20,481 --> 01:49:20,910
fucking girl.
And all of a sudden,

2578
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:22,820
my main man had to come up to be Jeff 
sussman.

2579
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:23,550
He goes,
hey man,

2580
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:26,070
they don't want you to know a lot.
I might as well.

2581
01:49:26,071 --> 01:49:26,950
Uh,
uh,

2582
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:32,150
I got to escort you off the line.
I remember I go such and walked me over 

2583
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:35,511
there.
And I went over there and put my hand 

2584
01:49:35,511 --> 01:49:35,511
down and the guy wouldn't put his hand 
and I go,

2585
01:49:35,511 --> 01:49:38,631
fuck you bitch.
And he just looked at me like he was a 

2586
01:49:38,631 --> 01:49:39,060
tough guy with his friends.
And I remember he looked at the security

2587
01:49:39,061 --> 01:49:40,910
guard to throw me out.
He listened.

2588
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:42,450
The security guard,
the security guard is like,

2589
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:44,740
we just smoked a joint.
Yeah,

2590
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,590
got his back.
It was very unfortunate.

2591
01:49:46,591 --> 01:49:48,130
He was very political

2592
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,350
and very,
very deceptive.

2593
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:51,900
He did.
No,

2594
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:53,000
he didn't.
He didn't,

2595
01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:54,240
he,
we,

2596
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:55,270
we,
we fucked up.

2597
01:49:55,271 --> 01:49:56,320
I fucked up in a bunch of stuff.

2598
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:58,070
You're always on that show.
But I fucked up with him.

2599
01:49:58,071 --> 01:50:00,890
I did not know he was that guy.
I thought he was a different guy.

2600
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,550
You know,
he do.

2601
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:04,580
Once he got in,
he wanted to do it his way.

2602
01:50:04,581 --> 01:50:06,270
He decided that he was running shit and 
it was a real.

2603
01:50:06,570 --> 01:50:07,560
Remember the day,
day,

2604
01:50:07,561 --> 01:50:08,820
one,
day one,

2605
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:13,880
we walk in and we already have.
We think that we have two episodes 

2606
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:13,880
already done.
Look,

2607
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,810
we've done all these sketches.
That's about two episodes worth.

2608
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:17,520
So we walked in,
we said,

2609
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:19,530
he goes,
we got these all these episodes ready to

2610
01:50:19,531 --> 01:50:20,610
go.
Let's do them.

2611
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:21,450
They said,
no,

2612
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:24,150
you've got to write some new shit that.
Forget about that.

2613
01:50:24,151 --> 01:50:25,740
That's too crazy.
We're not going to do that shit.

2614
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:26,830
Start over.
So right.

2615
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:27,990
Well,
it's not that simple.

2616
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:31,770
There was a bunch of sketches they had 
already prepared.

2617
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,000
Of course.
Of course.

2618
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:36,750
Of course.
That's Dave fucking won and they won.

2619
01:50:36,751 --> 01:50:41,751
They put me in a room with Chris Mcguire
and they go write some jokes about 

2620
01:50:41,751 --> 01:50:41,751
Miami.
We're going to go to Miami.

2621
01:50:41,751 --> 01:50:42,860
So now I am.
I am.

2622
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:47,870
I feel like I'm at high school all day.
We're trying to come up with these 

2623
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:47,870
ideas.

2624
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:47,870
I'm like,
fuck,

2625
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:50,320
we have all these other ideas that are.
What the fuck are we write down new like

2626
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:52,170
this is day one,
the first hour.

2627
01:50:52,171 --> 01:50:52,860
I'm like,
Oh shit.

2628
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:56,640
By the time that nightmare day ended,
Joe was there all day too.

2629
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:58,830
I go gentle man.
I just can't fucking right here.

2630
01:50:58,831 --> 01:51:00,480
They're ignoring all the other sketches 
that we did.

2631
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:01,770
And you were like,
yeah man,

2632
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:04,150
I can't right here though.
I mean I had a writer's block here too.

2633
01:51:04,151 --> 01:51:09,151
It's just not the right environment.
So that day you told Janice and the 

2634
01:51:09,151 --> 01:51:09,151
producers,
hey,

2635
01:51:09,151 --> 01:51:10,800
me and Eddie,
you're going to write at home.

2636
01:51:10,801 --> 01:51:12,990
We're gonna relax.
That's when all the creative juices come

2637
01:51:12,991 --> 01:51:13,800
out.
They said,

2638
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:17,130
go ahead and get the fuck out of here.
We'll still pay him.

2639
01:51:17,131 --> 01:51:19,140
They just wanted to get rid of me.
So they,

2640
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:24,060
I only worked there the first day and 
all after that was working at home.

2641
01:51:24,150 --> 01:51:26,790
My job was um,
you know,

2642
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:29,310
we got together a lot too,
but he was really busy with fear factor.

2643
01:51:29,311 --> 01:51:31,730
So if we couldn't get together,
I'd ride it home.

2644
01:51:31,731 --> 01:51:34,080
I'd have to have at least one sketch a 
day.

2645
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:36,180
So I'm at home.
Meanwhile I'm training,

2646
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,160
I'm training for Abu Dhabi going,
oh my God,

2647
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:40,140
this is not what I thought it was going 
to be.

2648
01:51:40,141 --> 01:51:42,110
Fuck,
I just quit my strip job,

2649
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:44,850
a club or Mr Club,
job strip,

2650
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:49,940
Dj job for 10 years now,
and I know this isn't gonna last day 

2651
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:49,950
one's a disaster.
I'm like,

2652
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:54,980
oh my God.
Either the shows shows going to get 

2653
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:56,781
canceled because they were green 
lighting a bunch of bullshit and every 

2654
01:51:56,781 --> 01:51:56,781
now and then occasionally someone would 
be funny,

2655
01:51:56,781 --> 01:51:58,770
like the decap attack thing,
the ducks ducks down.

2656
01:51:58,771 --> 01:51:59,930
Hope.
That was hilarious to

2657
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:02,190
what that show was.
We needed to have control of it.

2658
01:52:02,191 --> 01:52:06,460
Doug had to have control of it and we 
had to have an appraiser that was on the

2659
01:52:06,461 --> 01:52:11,461
same page and the other problem we have 
with that shows that it was the man 

2660
01:52:11,461 --> 01:52:11,461
show.
We should have been doing our own show.

2661
01:52:11,461 --> 01:52:13,450
We should not have been taken over 
someone else's show.

2662
01:52:13,451 --> 01:52:14,710
That's stupid.
To me.

2663
01:52:14,711 --> 01:52:16,530
It was like a prepackaged show that was 
like.

2664
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:21,540
It was easy.
It was like know have been on fear 

2665
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:24,151
factor.
I didn't really have the time to put 

2666
01:52:24,151 --> 01:52:24,151
something together so this way it'd be 
all put together,

2667
01:52:24,151 --> 01:52:28,261
but it was a mistake and it was 
disrespectful to those guys at Jimmy 

2668
01:52:28,261 --> 01:52:29,470
Kimmel and Adam curl.
I didn't even think it was at the time.

2669
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:34,680
I thought they had amicably parted ways 
because Jimmy wanted to do is talk show 

2670
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:35,560
and Adam wanted to do his thing,
but that wasn't the case.

2671
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:41,250
They didn't want the show to continue.
They didn't want anybody else to do it 

2672
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:41,920
and it was there a thing really.
So we shouldn't have done it.

2673
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:43,060
The first question,
you know,

2674
01:52:43,061 --> 01:52:48,061
I love it on my heart.
What is the air conditioner close by 

2675
01:52:48,061 --> 01:52:50,860
dog?
It was like a fucking yoga class in the 

2676
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:51,890
hallway.
I can't go out in the hallway.

2677
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,640
We're going to end it with a couple of 
minutes anyway.

2678
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:57,640
I'm not sweating.
It all got sweat on your fucking load or

2679
01:52:57,650 --> 01:53:01,510
it's just that shining too.
She's got makeup on Cock sucker.

2680
01:53:01,570 --> 01:53:04,490
I got glistening.
God put some oils.

2681
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:06,280
I would have pulled up.
Look slippery.

2682
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:08,450
What time is it?
It's almost 5:00

2683
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:09,310
or 4:00
rather.

2684
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:12,020
Oh,
you want me to go to for 20 symbolically

2685
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:13,580
when NSF for 27,
whatever.

2686
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:16,250
Hanging in there with 20 slash 20 
minutes without air conditioning.

2687
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:17,690
It's too fucking hot.

2688
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:19,880
Fuck.
Think about what Mccain went through and

2689
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:22,430
I'm you fucking Cock sucker.
That was his choice.

2690
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:24,620
You know what I'm saying?
I came up here to a house.

2691
01:53:24,621 --> 01:53:25,820
I,
you had the era,

2692
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:31,310
man.
We didn't even really talk about the UFC

2693
01:53:31,311 --> 01:53:31,970
man.
Let's do it.

2694
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,590
What the fuck?
Oh yeah.

2695
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,310
Mo.
We might as well write this.

2696
01:53:35,430 --> 01:53:37,070
What'd you think about bj and frankie 
edgar?

2697
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:38,780
I thought,
you know bj,

2698
01:53:38,781 --> 01:53:40,340
um,
the game plan,

2699
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:42,080
like when they were,
when they were in between corners,

2700
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:44,990
they didn't seem to have a game plan.
The game plan was like kick his ass,

2701
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:46,280
you know,
the game plan was like,

2702
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,080
what?
There was no leg kicks,

2703
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,270
you know?
I mean I want to see way more leg kicks.

2704
01:53:50,271 --> 01:53:52,600
I thought he could land leg kicks.
He's landing on man.

2705
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:54,530
Every one of those leg kicks takes the 
spring out of your step.

2706
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:57,050
You're dealing with a guy who can't.
You can't catch him.

2707
01:53:57,051 --> 01:53:58,540
He's so fast.
Frankie edgar's old.

2708
01:53:58,550 --> 01:53:59,760
Lightening bolt,
he's all over the place.

2709
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:00,580
Yeah,
he's too fast,

2710
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:06,090
but he was able to land lake kicks.
Bj landed a bunch of pancakes When he 

2711
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:06,380
tried,
but the attempts to board,

2712
01:54:06,381 --> 01:54:08,360
not that many.
I know it takes a lot of energy,

2713
01:54:08,361 --> 01:54:10,010
but he should have been thrown a lot 
more leg kicks.

2714
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:13,400
I think bj tried his fucking ass off.
Look at the fifth round.

2715
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:15,050
He went after him.
I just think frankie,

2716
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:15,770
frankie,
edgar,

2717
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:16,790
is that good?
Oh,

2718
01:54:16,791 --> 01:54:18,110
no doubt.
So fast.

2719
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:22,550
He never gets tired.
He could do 25 rounds so fast.

2720
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:25,850
His wrestling is top notch.
His striking is amazing.

2721
01:54:25,851 --> 01:54:30,851
He's hard to hit.
He's hard to get ahold of not taking 

2722
01:54:30,851 --> 01:54:30,860
anything away from frankie.
I just stopped bj's game plan,

2723
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:32,930
the game plan that I don't agree with.

2724
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:34,940
His advice,
the advice in the corner.

2725
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:36,380
I don't know.
It wasn't any advice.

2726
01:54:36,381 --> 01:54:38,980
They were just giving whatever kick his 
ass or whatever that it.

2727
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:41,510
Whatever you want to call.
I don't know this from that,

2728
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:44,300
but that last two fights against 
whatever.

2729
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,360
That was not the same guy seen against 
diego sanchez.

2730
01:54:47,361 --> 01:54:48,680
There's something more that.
Yeah,

2731
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:51,020
it could Be a lack of motivation.
That could be,

2732
01:54:51,021 --> 01:54:52,790
you know,
he needs to mix things up.

2733
01:54:52,810 --> 01:54:54,350
Well,
the difference between the camp,

2734
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:57,630
the difference between frankie edgar 
standup and dig a sanchez standard.

2735
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:03,240
It's a huge difference to his head,
but you don't have the cj hurt diego 

2736
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,020
early on a fight that fight was,
it was perfect.

2737
01:55:05,021 --> 01:55:10,021
So I didn't have any Fucking tenacity.
And the dj was gonna to frankie bEcause 

2738
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:12,740
frankie edgar counters that tenacity 
with his speed.

2739
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:15,170
It could be the bj get frustrated and 
you know,

2740
01:55:15,171 --> 01:55:20,171
he loses,
he gets a little disheartened and 

2741
01:55:20,171 --> 01:55:23,560
amazing wrestler with serious standard 
because for the longest time bj had the 

2742
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:23,930
best hands.

2743
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:25,820
That lightweight.
No one was fucking with bj.

2744
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:28,190
He was the best boxer.
Now frankie edgar,

2745
01:55:28,191 --> 01:55:29,540
it looks like his technique.
I mean,

2746
01:55:29,541 --> 01:55:32,600
it's totally different,
but it seems like he's just too fast,

2747
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:35,510
too good.
He's working too hard and I think,

2748
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:36,380
uh,
you know,

2749
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:38,630
maybe be jay might,
um,

2750
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:40,130
you know,
a switch,

2751
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:45,320
like you mentioned,
a switch of camps maybe might not hurt 

2752
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:48,110
add anything new or something fake 
jaegers kicking it to a whole nother 

2753
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:48,330
level athletically.
Speed,

2754
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:53,480
endurance wise,
the way he can move his training camp 

2755
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:53,480
must be insane.
You should fucking worker machine.

2756
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:58,610
He's one of those little dudes you can't
fuck with someone has been fucking with 

2757
01:55:58,610 --> 01:56:02,451
him all of his life and he built up a 
level of tenacity that not that many 

2758
01:56:02,451 --> 01:56:04,200
people can handle.
This mentality is fucking perfect.

2759
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:07,200
Randy couture's mentality,
you know what I mean?

2760
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,810
And It's cardio and his endurance and 
his will.

2761
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:11,940
But you know,
if you look at like the way he moves,

2762
01:56:11,941 --> 01:56:14,280
he moves better than random.
Sure.

2763
01:56:14,281 --> 01:56:16,420
I'm talking about the mental game and 
you know,

2764
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:17,040
people were saying,
oh,

2765
01:56:17,041 --> 01:56:18,380
he's not stopping people.
He stopped stopping.

2766
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,740
Some people,
which you have to realize though,

2767
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:22,710
is he's quite a bit smaller than 
everybody else in the division.

2768
01:56:22,711 --> 01:56:25,170
He's 154 pounds for real.
Legit.

2769
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:28,740
I think ultimately he's throwing with 
with evil intentions.

2770
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:31,470
He just hasn't developed the power yet,
But I believe,

2771
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:33,390
you know,
within the next couple of years,

2772
01:56:33,391 --> 01:56:34,110
two,
three years,

2773
01:56:34,111 --> 01:56:36,300
maybe five years,
he's going to be crushing people because

2774
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:41,301
he comes in,
he comes in to blast 100 percent now 

2775
01:56:41,301 --> 01:56:41,640
with pj heard veech and veatch is a 
tough guy,

2776
01:56:42,050 --> 01:56:43,000
you know,
and he,

2777
01:56:43,001 --> 01:56:48,001
you know,
he dropped him before he strangled him 

2778
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:49,910
and you know,
his standup when he was fighting with 

2779
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:49,910
sean cherokee.
He totally kickbox sean.

2780
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:50,080
Sure.
Yeah.

2781
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,690
He's a bad motherfucker,
dude.

2782
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:52,920
It's going to be interesting.
No,

2783
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:55,380
the rematch with gray maynard,
that's going to be very interesting,

2784
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:57,350
very interesting.
Enters a hard guy to beat male.

2785
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:02,360
You know,
you can complain all you want about his 

2786
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:02,360
style.
The problem is he presents problems.

2787
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:06,830
What's the solution to that problem?
You've got to be able to stop it from 

2788
01:57:06,830 --> 01:57:06,830
taking you down,
man.

2789
01:57:06,830 --> 01:57:07,620
He's a powerful motherfucker and he's a 
good wrestler.

2790
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:10,860
All you got to have a wicked fucking 
dustin hayzlett guard or something,

2791
01:57:10,861 --> 01:57:15,861
you know,
even more than more wicked than dustin 

2792
01:57:15,861 --> 01:57:17,781
hazy.
It's really right because dustin 

2793
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:17,781
hayzlett couldn't do shit against were 
story.

2794
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:17,781
You know,
it's more,

2795
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:19,410
he needs like some fucking a.
Okay,

2796
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:23,170
well he's going down to 55 because he 
should be there.

2797
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:27,840
Ricky story was three times stronger 
than dustin hayzlett.

2798
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:28,350
Right.
but,

2799
01:57:28,351 --> 01:57:28,860
so,
you know,

2800
01:57:28,861 --> 01:57:30,410
josh brooklyn's strongest fucked too.

2801
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:32,540
And dustin had no problem with him.
Yeah.

2802
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:35,190
But I think ricky story is stronger than
josh burke.

2803
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:41,130
He went out,
he's from Washington and he's rolled to 

2804
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:41,130
gerald,
one of my black belts a lot and gerald,

2805
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:42,690
he calls me to tell me about the roles 
with,

2806
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:44,190
with uh,
ricky story.

2807
01:57:44,191 --> 01:57:48,180
He said he's fucking amazing.
These are so powerful and good.

2808
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:50,220
Very technical.
You know,

2809
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:53,430
you're going to see him start to develop
some finishing too.

2810
01:57:53,490 --> 01:57:57,860
He's all into evolving and adding 
weapons to his game constantly.

2811
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:03,160
And he's young and he's his fucking 
mental game.

2812
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:07,650
That guy goes in there and fucking he 
loves to destroy,

2813
01:58:07,890 --> 01:58:12,890
to when take it up against the cage and 
started ripping his body with punches 

2814
01:58:12,890 --> 01:58:12,890
like,
oh,

2815
01:58:12,890 --> 01:58:17,750
it's very hard to deal with.
He's doing everything he could just to 

2816
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:21,561
stay alive.
This scott was just crushing him with 

2817
01:58:21,561 --> 01:58:21,561
punches.
Boom.

2818
01:58:21,561 --> 01:58:23,740
Boom.
I was thinking about randy and tyler.

2819
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:28,020
Frankie edgar might need to go ahead,
finish what you were saying.

2820
01:58:28,050 --> 01:58:30,530
Frankie edgar might really need to,
um,

2821
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:33,240
uh,
take his game to the next level.

2822
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:35,130
I was impressed with him off his back,
man.

2823
01:58:35,131 --> 01:58:36,930
I was impressed at how he recovered when
bj,

2824
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:42,480
bj amounts of them got a hold of him and
your dad when bj mount to.

2825
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:45,490
It's usually over frankie.
Just shit fucking.

2826
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,380
He's got so much energy,
man.

2827
01:58:47,410 --> 01:58:49,810
He could just keep pushing,
keep pushing.

2828
01:58:49,811 --> 01:58:51,910
He doesn't give up,
man does not give up.

2829
01:58:52,170 --> 01:58:53,220
You know,
some guys rest.

2830
01:58:53,221 --> 01:58:55,270
If bj mounted your rest and you're like,
oh fuck,

2831
01:58:55,271 --> 01:59:00,271
now I got to get out of this,
but let me bide my time for a big 

2832
01:59:00,271 --> 01:59:00,271
explosion.
Frankie,

2833
01:59:00,271 --> 01:59:00,760
The moment he got taken down with move,
move,

2834
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:01,540
move,
move,

2835
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:02,200
move,
move,

2836
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:02,800
move,
move.

2837
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:03,810
I'm out.
You know,

2838
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:09,280
obviously bj's card wasn't good enough 
to really threaten a frankie edgar.

2839
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,420
Really?
I mean,

2840
01:59:10,421 --> 01:59:13,000
frankie edgar has great defenses.
Jujitsu is awesome too,

2841
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:16,960
but what I did like about bj is his 
guard recovery,

2842
01:59:17,170 --> 01:59:20,110
his butterflies and his foot on the hip 
control.

2843
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:25,260
God damn,
it was really beautiful to see and 

2844
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:25,260
again,
you know,

2845
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:28,840
um,
he didn't really talk that much office 

2846
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:28,840
back.
Uh,

2847
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:31,120
but his recovery just amazing.
He really uses his flexibility.

2848
01:59:31,121 --> 01:59:33,220
Well,
and when he had both his hips on frankie

2849
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:37,360
had both his feet on frankie's hips at 
serious,

2850
01:59:37,361 --> 01:59:39,190
amazing yoda control,
you know,

2851
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,950
y'all know he's bad ass and controlling 
guys like that,

2852
01:59:41,951 --> 01:59:46,951
but not enough to finish guys.
It's weird that bj such a jujitsu 

2853
01:59:46,951 --> 01:59:49,981
master,
but yet he doesn't really finish guys 

2854
01:59:49,981 --> 01:59:49,981
off of his back.
He's had problems in a lot of fights.

2855
01:59:49,981 --> 01:59:51,370
Regards can take them down and hold them
down.

2856
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:56,371
You know,
that was obviously the problem that 

2857
01:59:56,371 --> 01:59:56,371
george st pierre fight and that was 
obviously the problem when frankie edgar

2858
01:59:56,371 --> 01:59:59,890
took him down to a problem that is 
prevalent in.
