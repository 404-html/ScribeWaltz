1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,070
The Joe Rogan experience,
when did you know that you like the

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:10,071
concept of gender identity to someone
who doesn't struggle with it is it's one

3
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:13,290
of those things where you try to wrap
your head around and try to understand

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,190
it,
but you'd never.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,940
It's like why we say that a man and
woman never really understand each

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:20,760
other.
They just sort of get this thing where

7
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:23,670
they accept that this is how you are and
this is,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,860
but I never.
I'll never understand what it's like to

9
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:28,890
want a baby in my body.
I never understand what it's like to

10
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:30,390
have my period.
I'll never.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,600
I'll never get it.
I'll never understand what it's like in

12
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:38,601
any way and being a woman and then
feeling like you're in the wrong sex.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,590
What does that like and how did you.
When did you realize it?

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,410
It's imagine if you felt all of a
sudden.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,840
One day he started saying,
I feel like a girl.

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,620
It would freak you out.
Yeah,

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,320
it would take you out.
Oh,

18
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:53,700
without a doubt.
Without a doubt.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,320
I really most.
I mean,

20
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,120
I can just tell you what most of my life
I felt that way,

21
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:00,330
but my parents did raise me like a boy
even though I was a little girl.

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,510
They completely raised me like a boy
because I wasn't very much of a tomboy.

23
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,710
Tomboys are okay.
A girl who looks like a little boy and

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,690
you know your Tan and you dress like a
little boy.

25
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:11,880
That's okay in this country.
Nobody freaks out on that.

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,690
It's when you start reaching puberty and
he started.

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,470
I started growing breasts and then I
started getting my period.

28
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:22,020
That's when everything shifted.
It was totally okay.

29
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,550
My childhood,
but then people are like,

30
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,090
uh,
you need to start treating her like her.

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,850
Not like he.
My parents were completely freaked out

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,530
because they always just.
It was like,

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,180
okay,
was that an issue?

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,880
Because I was just like a tomboy and
then when that happened,

35
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:39,480
I think that's when I'll like basically
everything all hell broke loose,

36
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:42,000
you know?
It wasn't your folks that have the issue

37
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,500
or the community that had the issue
community or their friends kept saying,

38
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:49,590
you've got to stop calling her.
He

39
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,170
said,
girl,

40
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,640
you know what I mean,
and I fuck.

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,680
The daycare will be quite such a freaky,
weird thing for people in our,

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,040
in the world.
Basically I manage this and a woman is

43
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,950
that,
that your penis makes you a man and your

44
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:08,730
vagina makes you a woman that's just
black and white for most people in the

45
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:10,530
whole wide world.
That's just how it works.

46
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,040
And so basically that's not true because
it's really how you feel inside your

47
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:21,081
outer presence is just the shell of your
soul and your being really.

48
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:22,860
I mean it's,
to me it's that simple,

49
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:25,590
but of course people don't get it
because people always take things at

50
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:29,190
face value.
They don't tend to get to know you or.

51
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,630
I mean,
I'm sitting right in front of you now.

52
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:34,630
Would you say that I am a woman?
No.

53
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,170
No.
A beard.

54
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,710
Beard.
Yeah.

55
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,400
No,
you're basically a man.

56
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,540
Thank you.
I appreciate the compliment from.

57
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,060
It's just that everyone gets so mad.
Oh,

58
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,490
the government doesn't represent the
people anymore.

59
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,031
It's like,
well,

60
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:57,240
that may be true,
but what are we doing to organize to

61
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,470
make it so that they start listening to
us again?

62
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,130
We need

63
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,963
to do that.

64
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,620
Um,
yeah and no.

65
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,490
I mean,
yeah,

66
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,750
and that something's got to change and
no in that really what would be optimal

67
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,540
is if the people that were in positions
of power realize that there were fucking

68
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,930
over the world,
that would be the best that they just

69
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:13,511
said,
hey guys,

70
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:13,871
you know,
we,

71
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,240
we ate some pot and we realized we were
a bunch of cons.

72
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,050
So we're willing to like try to figure
out how to figure out a way how to

73
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,210
reward people for the work they've
already done,

74
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,760
but yet,
and move forward in a much more ethical

75
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,980
way of distributing wealth.
Good luck,

76
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,850
man.
These are good luck.

77
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,860
That's socialism.
Talk you fucking Cami.

78
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,840
People are fucking human fossils.
Look at,

79
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,900
imagine taking Payoti with Baner.
Imagine

80
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,220
can you imagine looking across at that
guy and he's like transforming into

81
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,950
howdy doody in front of you.
His eyes are glowing red.

82
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,170
No Way,
man.

83
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,840
I don't know if it's possible.
It seems like these are a earlier

84
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:55,841
versions of human beings who,
whose entire operating system as a is

85
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:59,780
needed an update since the seventies.
There is no.

86
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,080
Imagine if you're.
If you had an updated your iphone since

87
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:06,050
when iphones came out.
That's what these people are like with

88
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:06,884
information,

89
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,420
but they're way worse than iphones.
These motherfuckers,

90
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,200
they murder.
They're on a bbs board of in the early

91
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,840
nineties with a 14,
four modem.

92
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,940
Yeah.
I'm the shit cuts out every five

93
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:17,920
minutes.
They're not gonna.

94
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,920
Want to tell it with a ball at all?

95
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,941
Yeah,
well it's.

96
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:21,830
It's the whole thing's fucking wrong,
man.

97
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:24,980
I really liked.
I had Christopher Ryan on my podcast and

98
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:28,130
he was talking about how in indigenous
cultures,

99
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,300
the people who never are allowed to
become leaders or the people who

100
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:36,080
indicate that they want to be leaders,
like those are always the ones people

101
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:39,260
avoid as being the leaders and the ones
who end up being leaders are the ones

102
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:43,190
who know the most about certain things
like fishing or hunting.

103
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,020
Those people are naturally followed.
They don't fucking throw makeup on and

104
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,800
try to get in front of a try to
hypnotize a country by saying the exact

105
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,350
same thing.
Everyone always says,

106
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,410
my fellow American president talk that
weird cadence.

107
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:59,420
Why are you talking like that?
What the fuck is that?

108
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,900
We've talked about that times on this
show you and if you were sitting at home

109
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:06,470
with a guy and he started talking to you
like that,

110
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,880
you would stop him.
He'd be like,

111
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:10,090
what the fuck are you doing?
Are you trying to hypnotize me?

112
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,320
If you imagine it,
Joey Diaz was sitting across from Obama.

113
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,540
Joey,
what we're doing right now,

114
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,890
bipartisan efforts have been reached.
We have reached out to Republicans for

115
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,963
unwilling to bargain.

116
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,430
Yeah.
He'd be like,

117
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:25,520
you're fucking killing me,
dog.

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
Definitely talking to me like that.
Oh yeah.

119
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,990
And also the way he gave me the fuck
out.

120
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,790
Boy,
I was North Bergen,

121
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,110
New Jersey.
Nineteen 78.

122
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,370
Look at this picture.
Look at me,

123
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,350
motherfucker.
I'm on a basketball team with a bunch of

124
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,900
guineas.
One black guy and a Filipino.

125
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,140
Why are you talking to me like that?
What's happening is diffusion of.

126
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,790
Oh,
you're so good.

127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,720
I've never gone over there it.
How high are you?

128
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:54,520
On a scale of one to a billion.
I'm like six for Joey Diaz to be this

129
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,080
high man.
Whatever you took,

130
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,320
must've fallen out of
that shit.

131
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,760
Must have come out of a time machine,
dude.

132
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,890
We met in Utah.
That black hole of the bulletproof wolf

133
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,080
that pops out a portal,
open up word,

134
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,900
vomited out.
Whatever you ate.

135
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,360
The orbs basically.
Basically the orbs.

136
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,171
Yeah,
man,

137
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,670
I've got to God as his house.
I've never seen you like this.

138
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,730
You're a fucking human being.
