1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,600
Oh,

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,860
I bet.

4
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:07,440
Comicview frys three times.

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,221
Yeah,

6
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:13,221
so I mean like who was hosting the first
one ever was lester barry who was a

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,060
black circuit comic
for the very religious.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,050
Nice.

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,050
The second time I did it was Arnez J in
Miami and the third time third time was

10
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:25,410
funny because I said by this point I go,

11
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm not doing comic view ever again.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,073
Like I just,

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,040
I've written that one off,

14
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:29,760
I'm not doing it.

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,770
It's always an awkward
situation when I go there too.

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,663
Why?

17
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,230
Because I'm the only white guy.

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,360
The production is white and they put some
weird responsibility on me to be like

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,840
the den mother of the comics,

20
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,700
so I've like smoked cigarettes and
I'd go outside and smoke a cigarette.

21
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:45,061
She was okay,

22
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:45,590
wait a second.

23
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,351
Who's everyone?

24
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,480
Jay's going to smoke if you want to smoke,

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,080
go out now with him and everyone's
got to be back in here in 15 minutes.

26
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,550
And then she tried to get me all of their
food tickets so I'd be responsible for

27
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:56,850
them.

28
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,683
It was very bizarre.

29
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,523
Just because you're white.

30
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:58,891
Yeah,

31
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,000
I mean I assume so.

32
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,410
That said,

33
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,810
a lot of the black comics will do things
like I'm gonna go out and smoke and

34
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:04,261
then go like,

35
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:04,501
you know,

36
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:08,680
fuck a chick for five hours trying to
come back 15 minutes for the show starts

37
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:09,840
like that did happen.

38
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,200
Well,

39
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,510
what they want you to do is just hang
out all day waiting for this show to

40
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:12,780
start.

41
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,020
Oh,

42
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,820
they put you there at nine
in the morning until night.

43
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,830
I went on at midnight.

44
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,610
What?

45
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:17,941
Yeah,

46
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,400
because they just don't want this wrangle
everybody because they don't believe

47
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,243
anyone.

48
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,170
No belief they're going to stay there.

49
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,100
They've done entire shows
about how happy they are.

50
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,300
Like they'll do a show where the same
joke gets repeated by different comedians.

51
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:33,690
Well,

52
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,190
yeah.

53
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,310
And,

54
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,240
and so I went and did it.

55
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,000
Kevin Hart ended up hosting,

56
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,840
I think one of the last ever seasons,

57
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,280
but it was called one mic stand and or
something like that I think is what it's

58
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:44,461
called,

59
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:45,294
one mic stand.

60
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,100
But it wasn't called comic view.

61
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,250
And Kevin called me and asked me if I
wanted to do it or if I would do it.

62
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,421
And I said,

63
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:51,601
yeah,

64
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,270
but I don't want it to comic view anymore.

65
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:53,461
He goes,

66
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,221
it's not common for you.

67
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:54,811
It's different.

68
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:57,120
They're flying people out now
they're doing it all right.

69
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,351
And set it up good.

70
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,040
And it was a,

71
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,851
when I signed the contract,

72
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,100
gets comic view presents one Mike Stand.

73
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,420
They gave us a big speech before we
taped anything and the guy was like,

74
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:07,740
we're changing comic view,

75
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:08,610
it's going to be different.

76
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,910
And the guys specifically said no more
stool humping and dj hit it and pulling

77
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,830
out fake teeth.

78
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,353
And uh,

79
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,170
I mean we weren't three comics in
before a guy was wearing fake teeth and

80
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:23,010
fucking a stool.

81
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,530
I mean not even about weight when
he's giving this speech to it,

82
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,160
these same guys who were getting ready
to fuck stools and put in fake teeth are

83
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:32,611
doing like,

84
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:32,851
you know,

85
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:33,601
like staring at him,

86
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:35,750
give the speech and like
nodding their heads like a,

87
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,740
like Pachino speech in any given Sunday.

88
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,211
It's a good emotional,

89
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:39,991
powerful speech.

90
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,580
How we're changing comic view now.

91
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,350
And then they went and
put the and they're like,

92
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:43,800
yeah,

93
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,660
let's go out there and
show the world something.

94
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,920
And then two minutes later you're like,

95
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:48,540
Dj put that Shit back on,

96
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,120
you can fuck a bitch with
fake teeth to this one.

97
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,523
No,

98
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,630
I couldn't agree more about DMT and,

99
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,261
and the,

100
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,860
the opening that it can give.

101
00:02:59,861 --> 00:02:59,980
I

102
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,580
mean,

103
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,320
I had the great advantage of taking it
for the first time with Terence Mckenna.

104
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,220
And he said,

105
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,890
do you want to check this arch or.

106
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,120
Okay.

107
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,953
Um,

108
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,410
and that's pretty cool in a resume,

109
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:14,950
by the way,

110
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,120
first time you did DMT,

111
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,373
Terence Mckenna?

112
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,363
Yes.

113
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,380
I won't say where or when,

114
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:23,590
because it could be put down on some
record somewhere that's probably already

115
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,010
there.

116
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,843
Don't worry about it.

117
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,973
Um,

118
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,010
but um,

119
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,731
for me,

120
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:34,510
it correspondent in many ways with what
people talk about near death experiences

121
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:39,511
because I went out through light into
a realm of great bliss and beauty.

122
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:44,110
And then I came back and it was like
coming back from a million miles away and

123
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,490
just coming back into my body
and as it were being born again.

124
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,360
So it was,

125
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,520
it was very much like a death
and rebirth experience for me.

126
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,870
And,

127
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,220
and,

128
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,440
um,

129
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,650
it was very,

130
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,910
very transformative.

131
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,460
Incidentally,

132
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,360
I think,

133
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,193
you know,

134
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,950
I've been trying to understand this
American phenomenon with southern Baptists

135
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,630
and one of the things that I think is
the key to this is that I think when they

136
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,130
talk about being born again,

137
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,470
originally baptism was just that.

138
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,980
I mean now you can get this
through dmt in five minutes,

139
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,720
but at the time of John The baptist,

140
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:21,970
you get it in five minutes
through being drowned.

141
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,730
People were lining up on
the bank of the Jordan.

142
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,600
They go in,

143
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
he holds them under.

144
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,630
If he held him under just long enough,

145
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,630
you could actually induce
a near death experience.

146
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,640
No life review at the drowning man sees
his life pass before him hold the amount

147
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:37,780
of just long enough.

148
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,500
And they'd have a near death
experience almost guaranteed.

149
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:41,981
I mean,

150
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,910
occasionally they might,

151
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,110
he might have done it too long,

152
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,630
but that was before litigation.

153
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,500
You know,

154
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,080
you might have litigation.

155
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,100
Yeah.

156
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,610
Good theory actually.

157
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,391
And then you see,

158
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:55,580
they come back and they said,

159
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,460
I've died.

160
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,480
I've seen the light,

161
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,010
I'd been born again.

162
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm no longer afraid of death.

163
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,880
My life has been transformed in five
minutes and the baptists were the people

164
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:10,881
who revived baptism by total immersion
in the 16th century and probably know in

165
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,530
America we don't hold them under that
long because this is post litigation.

166
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:16,710
Uh,

167
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,543
but you know,

168
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:17,881
when,

169
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:19,560
when the Baptist first got going,

170
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,260
this idea of holding
people aren't long enough.

171
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:26,880
All their language is the language
that relates to near death experiences.

172
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,050
And I don't think that to start with
baptism by total immersion was just

173
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:31,884
symbolic.

174
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,210
I think it was drowning.

175
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,420
What's needed is,

176
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,030
is transparency.

177
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,970
What's needed is up.

178
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,440
Do you think the transparency is going
to be an eventuality because of the

179
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:40,940
Internet,

180
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,370
do you think?

181
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:41,720
Learning?

182
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:41,940
Yeah,

183
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,741
I think it is right.

184
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,490
I think gets blown wide open.

185
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:49,491
It's very difficult to keep secrets and
it also erodes faith in the leadership

186
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:50,334
when like,

187
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,290
is this a democracy?

188
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,950
Is this a representative government or
is it some sort of a weird dictatorship?

189
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,010
Because if it is a hello fuck,

190
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:59,450
are you keeping that guy locked up?

191
00:05:59,620 --> 00:05:59,840
How,

192
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,610
how is Julian assange still locked up?

193
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,590
Because I need to know.

194
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,970
Please tell me what exactly he did that
you need to export him to the United

195
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,000
States.

196
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,121
Oh,

197
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,370
he released some information,

198
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,070
which is our information to citizens.

199
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,450
This is not,

200
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,793
you know,

201
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,650
information that should be
kept secret from a king.

202
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,480
It's relationship.

203
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,770
It's,

204
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,770
it's information that someone who
was being paid with taxpayer dollars.

205
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:27,860
I did a bunch of shit that the
United States doesn't agree with.

206
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,130
Everyone was upset by the
information that was released.

207
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,040
Everyone was upset by that video.

208
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,460
The collateral murder video.

209
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,290
Everyone was obsessed by this massive
amount of data that showed there was a lot

210
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,071
of coercion,

211
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:40,940
a lot of lies,

212
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,330
a lot of,

213
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,530
lot of stuff that we don't agree with.

214
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,820
And because of that,

215
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,860
this guy's like public enemy number one.

216
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:46,240
Yeah.

217
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,970
That's,

218
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,560
that's so anti what we think
of as the United States.

219
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,850
Completely contrary to everything in the
United States stands for complainant on

220
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:55,340
that.

221
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,840
And so in answer to your question,

222
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:57,561
I would say yes,

223
00:06:57,561 --> 00:07:02,561
it is some kind of weird dictatorship
posturing and posing as a,

224
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,770
as a democracy.

225
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:04,604
Because for,

226
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,200
for democracy to be real,

227
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,840
you have to have complete
openness of information.

228
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,490
People must be told the truth.

229
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,330
Then they can vote and make
decisions on the basis of facts.

230
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,210
What we actually have in our
society is the continual,

231
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:21,590
very clever massaging and
management of information.

232
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,610
So it ceases to be democracy.

233
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,391
When the voting,

234
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:28,160
when the voting public are fed,

235
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,160
lies on the basis of which they,

236
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,640
they make their decisions and vote
that that isn't democracy anymore.

237
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:39,260
That is in a way democracies are the
worst kind of dictatorship because they

238
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,790
have this appearance of freedom,

239
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,220
have this illusion of freedom.

240
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,301
And everybody can say,

241
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:44,451
well,

242
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:45,650
it's great because I live in a,

243
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,610
in a democracy,

244
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:46,881
at least.

245
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,140
If you live in a dictatorship,

246
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:51,380
you know you live in a dictatorship and
there are certain parameters that you

247
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,550
have to work your way round.

248
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,350
But when you live in a dictatorship
that is posing as a democracy,

249
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,810
it's more complicated.
